    <TEXT>So I #8217;m interested in getting my first and (REALLY ACTUALLY) only tarantula, and I #8217;m considering the usual suspects: B hamorii/smithi, various Aphonopelma, N chromatus, and a few others. But I have a pretty strong sentimental attachment to one species in particular, A crinirufum. I #8217;ve met this beautiful tarantula in the wild 3 times in Monteverde, Costa Rica, plus once in captivity at an ecological research center. It #8217;s not the most visually impressive specimen, but it lives in the place where I met my wife and where I might one day retire. I #8217;m a tarantula beginner, but I have a lot of experience creating naturalistic vivaria for reptiles. I can #8217;t find a lot of info on A crinirufum; is this a reasonable species for an  #8220;experienced beginner #8220;? Any tips, quirks, or special considerations for this species?</TEXT>

    <TEXT>In addition to my question, a little information on the awful picture: this lil beauty was on the floor in our bedroom of our rented cabin in Monteverde, Costa Rica. It was our last day, we had packed up for our flight home, and my wife was taking a shower. I was taking one last sweep of the room to see if we #8217;d left anything behind. This gorgeous critter had apparently been keeping us safe from noxious pests for the last week, but stayed out of sight. I gently covered it with a jar and slid a piece of paper underneath, and relocated it under the porch. I was afraid that the next guests might be a little more violent in their reaction to a tarantula in the bedroom. Otherwise I #8217;d have left the spider to live in its home territory.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Groovy, that #8217;s what I was thinking. Thanks for your input. Monteverde is all mountainous rainforest, with a  #8220;dry #8221; season that still retains a lot of moisture in the forest, and a rainy season that could drown a duck. I think that my air-conditioned house in Florida will provide the right temps. I #8217;ll just need to provide the right humidity level from there, and plenty of burrowing room.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Thanks for the detailed response. I #8217;ve heard about Beasley #8217;s Exotics, was thinking about contacting her. Homosassa would be worth the drive I think. If she doesn #8217;t have what I #8217;m looking for, I #8217;m glad to hear that there are still more than a few spiders at the show. It #8217;s been several years since I #8217;ve been.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I was recently in the same boat, but choosing my first tarantula. I also went with a hamorii. My very, VERY close seconds were B albiceps (beautiful!) and G pulchripes (not colorful, but the size and stripey knees made up for it). The GBB is also really cool, but apparently usually more feisty and very webby. Older care instructions indicate a more humid environment, but they actually come from an arid scrubland environment.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Word. That #8217;s one aspect of tarantula physiology that I #8217;d never read. I always just kinda figured, hey, they have eyes, they can see. Not so.

    <TEXT>An exception to this #8212; or so I #8217;ve heard #8212; are the species names that are derived from a person #8217;s name, and end with  #8220;i #8221; or  #8220;ii #8221;. In those cases, you just say the person #8217;s name and add -i (pronounced EYE) or -ii (pronounced EE-EYE). In those cases you refer to the pronunciation of the person #8217;s name, not how that name would be pronounced in Latin or Greek. Also, pronunciation has a level of importance, but it #8217;s more important that we #8217;re all just using the same names and spellings. Whether someone tells me that they #8217;ve just seen a beautiful Ayn-KEEK-lee-uh tom-PAIN-sis or In-SICK-lee-uh TAMP-in-sis, I know that they mean Encyclia tampensis, the Floridian Butterfly Orchid. And I #8217;ma get really excited.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>That sounds awesome! It #8217;s going to be a couple more years, because my Brachypelma sling would get lost in a big enclosure. But the main reason I got a tarantula was to build an elaborately accurate, natural enclosure. I #8217;ve been studying the hamorii #8217;s habitat, I have some cool ideas in mind, and I can #8217;t wait to build this thing! Thanks for creating a space to learn from, and to share the build.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>The acetic acid that comes out of aquarium silicone while it cures is some pretty gnarly stuff. It could cause serious problems to the respiratory tract of anything stuck with it in a confined space. For myself, I #8217;d let the background cure out in the open (preferably in front of a fan) for at least a week after I can #8217;t smell it anymore. Then I #8217;d install it, and check again after a day to see whether I could smell any sour fumes in the enclosure. It #8217;s a long time to wait for something you #8217;re deservedly excited about, but not worth risking the critter #8217;s health. And once it #8217;s finally in place, you won #8217;t even remember the wait time.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I don #8217;t know about those being lizard eggs. If they were all in the same spot, and not scattered around the dirt pile, those are more likely from some small species of snake. Anoles and geckos only carry one or two eggs at a time. And while they #8217;re happy to re-use a nesting site or nest communally, it would be pretty uncommon to see this many eggs in one particular spot. Plus I #8217;ve seen a few hundred anole and gecko eggs, and none were quite so oblong. If these are from a lizard, it #8217;s a larger species. As far as care, do NOT expose them to too much light. Mama buried them for a reason, and the person who failed to hatch anole eggs failed for a reason. I #8217;ve done best hatching wild reptile eggs by taking some of the dirt where they were found, halfway burying them in a closed plastic container, and sticking it in the garage. This is cooler than being outside in direct sunlight but warmer than being in an air-conditioned house... kinda like most reptile nest sites. Add just a tiny bit of water once every week or two if the substrate is getting too dry and the eggs start to shrivel. If you #8217;re wondering whether you should moisten the substrate, probably not. Mold is a more likely problem than drying out. Open the container daily or at least 4-5 times a week for fresh air exchange and to check whether the babies have hatched. Most small reptile eggs hatch within 30-60 days of being laid, but you have no idea when that was. Or you can just pick a nice spot in your yard, preferably at the base of a plant. Dig a shallow hole, loosely cover the eggs, and hope for the best.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Possibly unpopular opinion: I #8217;m excited for anyone who wants and gets a random extra spider, but I hate this particular behavior from breeders/ sellers. It seems irresponsible to me; it indicates someone who doesn #8217;t value the lives that they #8217;re selling for profit. I have one tarantula. That #8217;s because I want ONE tarantula. I don #8217;t have the space or supplies for a second. Besides that, I was EXTREMELY picky in choosing the species that I purchased. While a seller might think they #8217;re doing me a favor by sending me a free  #8220;product #8221;, there #8217;s almost no chance that they could randomly send me a species that I actually want. So now I #8217;m stuck with the responsibility and cost of caring for an animal that I didn #8217;t expect and didn #8217;t want. At least in this case, OP might have time to contact the seller and refuse the freebie or ask what species it is (and look like a  #8220;choosy beggar #8221;). I once ordered a very specific subspecies of turtle online. The seller ran into issues and shipped the turtle a week later than anticipated, but decided to smooth things over by just *sending me an extra turtle* of a different subspecies. I found this out when the turtleS arrived, and there was a note with a smiley face. Like, congratulations #8212; you now have twice as many turtles as you actually wanted, and one of them is really ugly. It took me a couple of weeks and two hours of driving to find a responsible person to take the unwanted turtle. I understand that money goes into breeding and caring for animals, and money should be expected to change hands when a person gets a pet. And in the Tarantula Hobby, there are lots of people who are more than happy to receive and house any free spood that crawls their way. But when a seller just throws in a freebie without even asking whether the buyer wants it or telling them what it is, it really makes me question how much that seller values the lives that they #8217;re peddling. At that point it seems like life is just a retail product. End rant.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Neurology and neuropathy is really interesting stuff. So I work at a gun store that has a shooting range, and one day I was working the check-in booth for the range. A man walked up to shoot, carrying his range bag, and I could tell that something was up. He was slouching, and twitching, and just looked to be in bad shape. He was conversationally coherent though (actually even really clever and fun to talk to), so I knew it wasn #8217;t drugs or alcohol. He filled out his paperwork, but he dropped the first pen that he grabbed because he couldn #8217;t keep hold of it. His handwriting was so shaky and poor that I reluctantly had to ask him to make a second attempt at filling out his paperwork. I honestly couldn #8217;t read a word of what he had written because his hands shook so badly. So obviously, as the person in charge of safety at a place where LIVE GUNS ARE BEING USED, I had to have a conversation with him. I took him aside where other customers couldn #8217;t hear us, and I mentioned that I couldn #8217;t help but notice his tremors. I wanted to make sure that he could safely operate a firearm, so that he and my other shooters would be safe. His response really surprised me. He said,  #8220;Thank you for looking out for me, and for our safety, and I really appreciate the way you asked me about my tremors. It #8217;s honestly really embarrassing. I used to be just as strong and able as you are. And better-looking, too. But I have early-onset Parkinson #8217;s Disease, and the tremors have gotten really bad. They #8217;re pretty much all the time now. But for some reason, the ONLY time they stop these days is when I #8217;m holding a gun and aiming at a target. So I don #8217;t blame you if you want to follow me in and make sure I #8217;m not a danger to everyone else, but I already know that this is going to be the most focused and least shaky that I #8217;ll get to be all week. #8221; So I took him at his word, and I kept a respectful but safe distance as he set up to shoot in the range. He seemed pretty rough pushing open the heavy doors and fumbling with the zipper on his bag. But sure enough: once the pistol was loaded and pointed at his target, the tremors stopped entirely. His form was perfect; his hands were rock solid. Bruce put ten rounds into the ten-ring of his target, and then pushed the target out even farther as he reloaded. Bruce was without doubt the best shot on the range that day, and I never charged him another admission fee as long as I was working the range booth. I just admired his strength, and wanted to provide him with a place to stop all the shaking. Haven #8217;t seen Bruce in a couple of years, so I can make some pretty safe assumptions about how his story has gone. But it was really cool to see that trembling man stand up straight and run a gun as well as anyone else.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Just do what you can. If there #8217;s an area of brackish water with lots of tall grass or seaweed, and not too heavy currents or waves, that would be ideal. That #8217;s the environment where my terrapin biologist friend has seen most hatchlings. But turtles have tons of eggs at a time because the babies most likely won #8217;t survive. If you see a heron or a crab eat the baby ten seconds after you set it free... that sucks. But it just is what it is. Unfortunately the few attempts to breed and raise terrapins for wild release resulted in stupid turtles that didn #8217;t know how to survive, and all died within a year.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>What #8217;s really weird, we had these ALL THE TIME at my house and in my neighborhood when I was growing up. But then around 2000 or so, I started seeing the Indo-pacific gecko, Hemidactylus garnottii. And the Mediterranean pretty much disappeared. Since then, I #8217;ve seen a few of the  #8220;true #8221; house geckos, Hemidactylus frenatus, but mostly the Indo-pacific, and almost zero of the Mediterranean. Florida is a real haven for exotic, invasive species to take over, but it #8217;s been interesting to see the non-natives battle it out amongst themselves.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>ACK-shoo-ully... Like the other person said, there have been abortions since the dawn of time. In fact, there #8217;s a theory that the Abrahamic myth of the Fruit of the Knowledge of Good and Evil was tied to abortion. So there were no apples in that part of the world at the time the myth was constructed. Despite the European interpretation of the story, the fruit definitely wasn #8217;t an apple. But there was a fruit of similar size, maybe even more pretty, and possibly even tastier! The Fruit of Knowledge could easily have been a pomegranate! And if a woman were to eat a bunch of the seeds of a pomegranate, the strong steroids inside the seeds could cause uterine contractions. Which, in the early stages of pregnancy, could cause termination of the fetus. So it #8217;s theorized that the story of the eating of the Forbidden Fruit, a woman choosing to do something that men don #8217;t want her to do, is based on a woman gaining knowledge and autonomy over her own body. Which is obviously abhorrent and fucking evil in the eyes of ancient backward savages and the Arpaio family.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>It #8217;s a very rare and special thing that you #8217;re doing, and I hope you succeed at it. It #8217;s difficult to recognize that trait in yourself, even if it #8217;s pointed out to you. It #8217;s even more difficult to change it. I applaud you. Like seriously, my heart soared as I read your post. You #8217;re going to fail sometimes. Know that right now, accept it right now, and don #8217;t consider an instance of failure to be the end of your attempts to change. You might even lose a love or a friend when you revert back to that bad old way of acting, and it #8217;s easy to take that hard circumstance and say,  #8220;Well, that #8217;s just who I am. I #8217;ve always been that way. And maybe it #8217;s how I #8217;ll always be. #8221; That #8217;s what your dad did, and it made you act this way. That #8217;s what my dad did, and it made me act that way. I lost people. They deserved better than what I offered them, but it was just  #8216;a part of who I was #8216;. Then, at 30 years old, I got an opportunity to spend a lot of time with my dad, and I saw how my worst traits were reflections of his. To be fair, my dad was mostly a *fantastic* human being. He was giving and generous, thoughtful, and truly brilliant. I never met a person who disliked him. But inside the house, his expectations of our family members were strict. Deviating outside of his expectations was met with disappointment, derision, verbal abuse, and punishments that were absolutely cruel. I grew up and put my closest friends and lovers through the same. It was painstaking to recognize this, and torturous to make my way out of it. And I still stumble, in fact I #8217;ll probably always struggle with it. It #8217;s SO much easier to do what comes naturally than to try to be the person you #8217;d rather be. But man. When you win, when you do the things that make you feel like a good person rather than just doing the wrong thing that feels right, it #8217;s absolutely worth it. In other words, I feel you. I think we have a lot in common, and I hope you keep it up.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Hmm. I dunno. So after a bit more research, I found that there are 4 widow species here in Florida: bishopi (red), geometricus (the non-native brown that I see ALL the time), variolus (northern black), and mactans (southern black). After seeing the variolus I agree that it could be this species #8212; they tend to have more ornate patterns on the abdomen, like this pretty spider. But they also seem to be thinner-bodied and longer-legged than this chunky girl was. And I found some pics of juvenile mactans that have the same body shape and abdomen pattern as this one. So I #8217;m still leaning toward mactans, but I #8217;m by no means an expert. I would be happy to defer to anyone who knows better... which is probably most people who are into spiders.</TEXT>

Imagine, instead of just salt, you sprinkle some delicious juice onto your rice, grits, greens, veggies, whatever... and along with salt it also brings tart flavors, garlic, spicy, umami... all of the flavors. And in addition to a delicious seasoning, your brine from your best batches can provide a starter culture for future ferments. Save that goodness.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Since hamorii comes from the same place as the Nahuatl language, I named mine Itehua meaning  #8220;Big Bellied #8221;. Some other Nahuatl words that I considered were Tlatla- Fire/burning, Tocatl- spider, Eztic- blood colored. I think that Tlatlatocatl or Eztictocatl would mean fire spider or blood colored spider, the same way the genus Tliltocatl means black spider.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>This one got posted and removed or deleted earlier today. [It #8217;s bullshit](https://www.nytimes.com/2017/05/08/us/alligator-attack-florida.html). An alligator can hold its breath for hours, her blocking its nose would do nothing. Also, alligators are able to tightly close their nostrils, which they do any time they #8217;re underwater or attacking prey, and would prevent her from getting her booger-hooks in. Nothing in any article I could find mentioned sticking her fingers in the gator #8217;s nose. This article did mention, however, that the girl claims to have pried the beast #8217;s jaws apart... which is also bullshit. An alligator expert even calls her out (politely) in the article. Gators chomp down with a force up to 2000 pounds. This girl either got lucky and wiggled away when the gator adjusted its grip on her leg, or it decided to let go. Lucky girl, cool story, bullshit post.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Catching the skinks in your yard definitely doesn #8217;t make them want to stay. It stresses them out at least to some degree, and wastes their energy running from you. They probably won #8217;t leave, because most reptiles stick to the same territory, but being repeatedly captured certainly isn #8217;t going to make them feel good about sticking around. Is there a reason that you need to keep catching these skinks, rather than just enjoying watching them do their thing? If you weren #8217;t constantly snatching them up, they might become comfortable and let you get close. Then you could watch them do something more exciting than just struggling to get away from you.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Land tortoises are almost entirely herbivores, just by virtue of being too slow to catch live prey. Still, most of them are perfectly willing to chow down on carrion or unwitting invertebrates. But most aquatic turtles are primarily carnivores. They eat fish, shrimp, snails, worms, crayfish, frogs, etc., with some species being more or less willing to eat vegetation. This is a snapping turtle, like the first commenter mentioned, and one of the chompiest, most carnivorous turtles out there. Pretty much the T-Rex of the turtle world.

    <TEXT>Moonshine, man. That #8217;s moonshine. Sort of. Now, the term moonshine technically refers to any distilled spirits made illegally. So whiskey can be moonshine, as can rum or grappa or any number of illicit liquors. But typically the term refers to white sugar that has been fermented and distilled. In fact, there #8217;s been a surge in popularity of legit companies making and selling fermented, distilled, and flavored sugar water, and calling it  #8220;Moonshine #8221;. However, some people take offense to that. Moonshine isn #8217;t just white sugar spirits, it #8217;s a name that #8217;s earned by  #8216;stillers in the backwoods, the cricks and hollers, the kitchen stove tops, the garages and backyards.

It #8217;s small enough to not notice in your pocket, quick to your hand, and the clip can be attached to the bill of a ball cap for use as a headlamp.

It would be extremely rare for this to occur naturally, so I #8217;m guessing that this one is a pet snake and you were just testing us? Was I right?</TEXT>

    <TEXT>As someone else mentioned, wild snakes often fail to thrive in captivity. The stress and imbalance of a captive life could kill or weaken it. The other side of the coin is that captive reptiles often fail to thrive on re-introduction to the wild. So *IF* you #8217;re able to successfully keep it for a while... Keeping it in a small cage with ample food and no predators will prevent it from learning and utilizing necessary skills that it would otherwise use in the wild. Prey drive, seasonal food sources or climatic challenges, defensive tactics from predators #8212; all of that will be weakened by any time being fattened up in a cage. Wild animals face challenges, and some of them die young. Your desire to help this cool critter is natural and commendable. But you #8217;re more likely to do real harm than even a little good.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I needed a batch of ginger beer for ginger mojitos, but didn #8217;t have time to work up a nice bug. So I fetched into my mead-making supplies and whipped up this quick ferment. It #8217;s really delicious! Caveats: most winemaking yeasts are way stronger than the wild ones in a ginger bug. I #8217;m *hoping* the cold shock will make them stop working and remain delicious for a while, but this batch might only be tasty today, and then dry and boozy in a day or two. Side note: don #8217;t toss the sliced ginger after straining. It still had enough flavor that I halved the amount of water, simmered it again, and used it to flavor my hibiscus-ginger kombucha. After that it was pretty spent, and I felt ok tossing it in the compost. EDIT: oops, and should be  #8220;add yeast when  lt;90 DEGREES #8221;, not percent. But y #8217;all knew that.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>My mead-making background hears you and agrees completely. But I #8217;ve been messing around with lots of different ferments lately, testing the boundaries and combinations, and this is definitely an experiment. In a few days I #8217;ll know whether I made a product that #8217;s tasty for more than just today. What I can say for sure: I have had more than a quart of this brew today with zero stomach upset. Seven other people drank it, either straight or in a mojito, with nothing but compliments and requests for more. I agree, a hard cold-crash can lead to the production of hydrogen sulfide and its classic  #8220;farty #8221; egg smell, and bitterness. So it might turn out in a day or two that my aggressive experiment was a failure for bulk production or creating a stable product. But for today, a few quarts of tasty ginger beer made several people very happy! (Especially after it got mixed with muddled mint, lime juice, simple syrup, and a handcrafted rum...)</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Sure! There #8217;s a certain amount of sugar that #8217;s necessary for fermentation to create the CO2 fizz, and a perfectly balanced drink (by your standards) would wind up very fizzy with just about zero sweetness. I don #8217;t know where that balance lies in the amount of added sugar, but you should play with it. Would you be more comfortable with agave sugar, or honey? Because that would work too!</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I #8217;ve played with rum for several years. Making mead definitely helped my process in making rum, because a crappy wash makes a crappy final product. I started with just molasses in my wash, then molasses and turbinado sugar, then I added panela (dried sugarcane juice) in place of molasses, and I #8217;ve finally settled on a recipe I like the most. So technically my rum is more of a flor de ca #241;a than true rum. On top of that, I #8217;ve used two different types of stills with incredibly different results. From there, I found the mixture of spices and the amount and type of toasted oak that I like to use for flavoring. I really, really think that you should try it. As far as energy and money to output ratio, it #8217;s definitely a loss. I built my first still and bought my second, I #8217;ve had a couple of failed runs, and a few that were barely worth drinking. There #8217;s also the legal aspect, though I DEFINITELY ALWAYS FOLLOW THE LETTER OF THE LAW IN MY JURISDICTION, but that can be a bitch depending on where you live. And at the end of it, you can pay $20-25 for a 1.5 liter bottle of Nicaraguan Flor de Ca #241;a that #8217;s actually pretty damn tasty. But holy cow. The first time you run off a batch and it #8217;s better than anything your paycheck can afford at the liquor store? And holy crap, you have almost TWO GALLONS of this stuff? AND YOU MADE IT?!?! Definitely worth it to me. Your experience may vary.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I had the same problem from a batch made from a wild-cultured bug. In researching, I found that the hydrogen sulfide  #8220;farty-egg #8221; smell comes from stressed-out yeast. Either there #8217;s not enough food/sugar, or temperature is wrong (usually too cold) or the yeast is not suitable for fermenting the particular cocktail of juices that you #8217;re asking it to ferment. The problem can be solved by either not stressing the yeast (which might be impossible depending on your recipe or desire to serve the brew cold) or by burping the brew frequently to degas the sulfur (which leaves your beer flat). You can also try using a different yeast. I recently had really nice results from a commercial yeast, but it was definitely cheating.</TEXT>

    <TITLE>Quick Down-N-Dirty Ginger Beer update</TITLE>
    <DATE>2020-06-16 13:05:56</DATE>
    <TEXT>Nine days ago I posted the recipe I used to make a ginger beer in less than 48 hours using commercial yeast. If anyone is interested, here #8217;s an update now that we #8217;re down to our last bottle! The beer was really popular at our daughter #8217;s first birthday party (featuring outdoor dining and social distancing!). It was mostly used in ginger mojitos, but a couple of guests drank it straight and were impressed that it #8217;s possible to make such a tasty, fizzy  #8220;soda #8221; without fancy machinery. I loved the STRONG ginger flavor with a nice balance of citrus and the mild to medium sweetness. In all, I was pleased with it in its first two days. But would a strong commercial yeast stop fermentation once it was refrigerated? Would it stress out and produce off flavors? Would it keep working and become a dry, bitter, boozy beverage with the risk of becoming a bottle bomb? The news a week later is almost entirely good. The yeast didn #8217;t completely stop working, but it slowed down to almost a halt. There #8217;s a ton of carbonation, and it takes a minute to slowly degas a new bottle or it #8217;ll spray the first time you open it. But the extra fizz makes it so refreshing! The mild sweetness is now extremely mild, and for some reason the citrusy tartness has lessened as well. It #8217;s now almost entirely a zesty ginger blast, with just enough lime and sugar to balance it out. As far as off flavors from cold crashing, I notice just the faintest whiff of sulfur in the scent of the fizz; my wife says I #8217;m imagining things and that it #8217;s just a faint yeast smell. In conclusion, I #8217;m calling this experiment a success. If you just want to quickly produce a tasty beverage, and you #8217;re able to drink it up within 2 weeks, this recipe will work. I #8217;d probably cut the ingredients in half next time. Obviously, you miss out on the satisfaction of cultivating a ginger bug, and you won #8217;t get the full spectrum of wild, beneficial microbes. But if it #8217;s Wednesday night and you just remembered that you promised ginger mojitos for the weekend... the Quick Down-N-Dirty will do the trick.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I did a little experiment with commercial yeast, white tea with fruit and spices, and sugar. I did it in a sealed flip-top bottle, just let it ferm away for a week without burping it. I had never carbonated anything before. Didn #8217;t know what to expect. I at least opened the bottle over the sink, in case it foamed over. That was a cutely na #239;ve underestimation. That bottle popped open with such force that it ripped the top and wire hinge assembly right off and flung it away. The tea-wine geysered four or five feet straight up, where it splattered off the ceiling and painted half the kitchen in sweet pink juice. There was a solid three seconds of spray, then nothing. My wife just stared at me in shock from the next room. I looked at the bottle, completely empty except for an inch or two of pink fizz. It was kind of tasty. I had used a little too much sugar. The kitchen took two hours to clean.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I hear you, and your logic is sound. To discuss the current coronavirus pandemic, and the disease that the virus causes (COVID-19), it #8217;s perfectly accurate and acceptable to mention that it originated in China. In fact, from an epidemiological standpoint, that fact has to be addressed in order to trace the path of infection, to discover its source, and to learn what measures have been effective and ineffective in treating it. But when Trump says  #8220;ChinaVirus #8221; in this context, he #8217;s not just astutely mentioning the origin point. He #8217;s deflecting and blaming. He #8217;s trying to point out the moot fact of the virus #8217;s origin so that we focus less on his administration #8217;s complete failure to give this disease the respect and response that it deserved. Blame China, and don #8217;t think about the tens of thousands of Americans who might still be alive if the government had responded appropriately, if our president hadn #8217;t treated the virus as insignificant. And to think that Trump can call it the ChinaVirus and NOT expect racist backlash against Chinese and other Asian people #8212; especially among Trump #8217;s notorious support base #8212; that #8217;s just staggeringly na #239;ve.

    <TEXT>I don #8217;t keep any reptiles anymore, but I was interested in your post and in your business idea. It sounds like a great service and something that could be useful to a lot of people. I just want to add my two cents, and bring up something (that I #8217;m sure you #8217;ve thought of, but I #8217;m not sure how your service is set up). It looks like you #8217;re interested in customers paying a flat monthly rate and receiving scheduled delivery of feeders. That would be SUPER convenient. It would be awesome if I never had to think about going to a pet store, or worry about them being out of the size feeder that I need! But back when I kept lizards and snakes, none of my critters could be expected to keep to our usual schedule. Shedding and seasonal changes often resulted in occasional skipped meals, which wasn #8217;t a big deal. I #8217;d throw away a frozen/thawed feeder, or keep a live one for a week and try again. But if I #8217;m scheduled to receive ANOTHER live mouse next week, what do I do with this extra one? You #8217;d have to have it set up where your customers can quickly and easily cancel or change their next delivery if needed. If you get a lot of clients or a few big ones, that will be a lot to keep up with. And if customers do skip or reduce a delivery, do they get refunded? Is there a discount on next month #8217;s charge?</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I #8217;m pretty cool with just about every invertebrate... except cockroaches. They #8217;re common here in Florida. When I was young, probably about 4 years old, I tried to smack one that was climbing up the wall. It flew into the air and straight at my face, bouncing off my face several times. It was pretty horrifying. 34 years later, an unexpected roach still sends my heart rate through the roof and makes my skin prickle. I #8217;m fine doing yard work or digging through the gardening tools in our outside shed, because I *know* to expect roaches. No big deal. But if something crawls on me, I will flip out until I know that it #8217;s not a roach. If I feel something creeping up my leg, I #8217;d rather look down and see a black widow than a cockroach.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>As another person said (in a much less pleasant way), glass Ball jars are pretty much the standard for fermentation and storage. You #8217;ll maybe want to replace or modify the lids, depending on what you #8217;re making and what stage you #8217;re at. Beyond that, you can find and purchase any number of handmade or commercial vessels that specifically suit what you #8217;re making. And of course, there #8217;s a strong DIY side to fermentation, so you might want to sit down with some clay/wood/glass/whatever and make some incredible one-of-a-kind containers. But Ball jars will do the job well for almost anything you want to ferment. It #8217;s just a matter of using the right type of lid and (if necessary) spring or weight for the job. Fun side note: the plastic lids with silicone rings can be self-burping... if you don #8217;t wrench the lids down tight. Otherwise, you could wake up at 3am to the sound of popping lids that sound like gunshots to your sleeping brain. It #8217;s no fun waking up with a body full of adrenaline, clearing your house with a handgun and a flashlight, only to wind up cleaning milk kefir from every surface in your kitchen while completely nude. The second and third time it happens will be just as embarrassing, but at least you #8217;ll know well enough to leave the gun in the safe. Choose and tighten your lids wisely.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Right. Kids #8217; menus exist so that parents will come in and order real food, as well as get a bite to eat for their tykes, and the restaurant can earn money. They #8217;re not making enough money to stay in business if all they sell are $5 kids #8217; pizzas. So if an adult wants to be a little bitch and order off the kids #8217; menu, the restaurant upcharges the meal so they can actually stay in business and continue to sell real menu items to real people. The Karen who took this picture had a choice before ordering to proceed with their order or not. They chose to place the order, and then whine about it. Like a little bitch who orders from the kiddie menu.</TEXT>

    <TITLE>Kefir separates and it makes me sad</TITLE>
    <DATE>2020-07-20 12:33:11</DATE>
    <TEXT>I started making kefir back in February. I sourced my grains from a local goat farmer, and quickly developed a pretty solid routine. One heaping spoonful of grains in a quart jar of whole milk, leave it out at room temperature for 48 hours, gently agitating the jars anytime I was in the kitchen. Temps stay in the mid-70s F during the day, low- to mid-70s at night. Strain the grains, store them in a plastic tub in the fridge with a splash of fresh milk when they #8217;re not being used. This was working well #8212; I consistently made tangy, sweet, creamy kefir for months. Not lately though. Temperatures *may* have increased a bit on average lately, but we keep the A/C going and everything else is the same. These days, if I strain my kefir before it curdles and separates, the product just tastes like milk that #8217;s gone off a bit. Not creamy and tangy and delicious. If I let it sit for the whole 48 hours, it turns into foamy chunks and whey. The result is a pretty tasty, spreadable cheese. But that ain #8217;t what I #8217;m after here! Has the bacterial culture of my grains shifted, and become more apt to cause curdling and separation? Or have temperatures risen more than I thought? I was getting good kefir all the way into May, and May is already pretty hot here in Florida.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I agree 100%. I #8217;ve relocated coral snakes from my yard, because I absolutely adore them. But one day I was out doing some yardwork when I heard my elderly neighbor shouting. She had pinned a coral snake under her shovel, but was afraid to lift it in case the snake got loose and bit her. I could see that its back was already broken and insides were coming out. So I sadly helped finish the job, and kept the skin. I don #8217;t know if she #8217;ll do it, but I encouraged her to let me come catch any others that she sees in the future. Happily, she *does* know the difference between venomous and harmless species. She doesn #8217;t bother any of the nonvenomous snakes.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Originally I intended it to be a self-defense karambit. But I #8217;m a pretty peaceful person, and as I started cutting the shape, I realized more and more the things that I #8217;d be most likely to use a knife for: foraging, cutting strings and lines, cutting up fruits, and gardening. So I made the blade smaller, lighter, and thinner. I added some jimping on the back for delicate work and skinning critters. It works well for all of those things. I have to admit though, as much as I love it, I ground down the wrong side of the edge to be effective for whittling by a right-handed person. Live and learn.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>This sheath isn #8217;t nearly as fine as most of the beautiful items I see on this sub. But I thought y #8217;all might be interested, since I processed all three hides myself, and did all the work by hand. The inner lining is squirrel rawhide. I skinned and fleshed it, then soaked the little hide in woodash lye to buck the fur. I didn #8217;t take off the grain. After wringing it and neutralizing pH with vinegar and water soaks, I dampened it one last time and wrapped it around the knife, then pressed it between cardboard and let it dry between some clamps. The knife almost  #8220;clicks #8221; into place in the dry rawhide. The outer leather is braintanned buckskin from a doe I harvested in 2018. This gal #8217;s hide was *tough* and thick. I ran out of brain slurry and had to substitute egg yolks for a final soak before frame-stretching and smoking the hide. Finally though, old gal worked soft enough to make a pair of gloves, a possibles bag, and this knife sheath. The coral snake hide accent makes me sad... but it #8217;s *so cool*. TL;DR: I love snakes, even venomous ones. My neighbor whacked one with a shovel. I helped put it out of its (truly awful gooey) misery, and kept its hide. I preserved it with 50/50 alcohol and glycerin by volume. No fleshing was needed, but the outer dermis layer of each scale had to be peeled off after the alc/glyc soak. My thumbnail did the trick. The rest of the work was done by hand with a crappy leatherworking kit from Michael #8217;s Crafts, including the heavy black thread. The fine thread is 30lb PowerPro fishing line, including the bead fringe. The knife is handmade from marine-grade stainless steel, the handle wrap is handmade cordage from Caesar weed fibers, sealed with pine pitch. There #8217;s also a few thin layers of rubber cement holding the skins in place. I made this as a gift for my 13-month-old daughter, for whenever she #8217;s responsible enough to have her own knife.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Your questions are being answered really well, so I #8217;ll just throw in my two cents on question number two, as I haven #8217;t yet seen my viewpoint represented whenever this question is asked. I have a very difficult time recommending a tarantula as a pet for anyone who has any level of arachnophobia. That #8217;s because, despite having zero fear of spiders, I quickly learned that my B hamorii makes me nervous as *hell*. I #8217;ve handled venomous wild snakes, and powerful monitor lizards with razor sharp teeth. I once pulled an angry 10 #8217; Burmese python from the rafters of a garage, and my heart did not beat as quickly as it sometimes does around my tarantula. That #8217;s because I find the spider to be very unpredictable. The angry snakes and lizards are easy: they #8217;re going to try to bite me and/or run away. But the spider? Mostly he just sits still when I open the enclosure for feeding and watering. Sometimes he crawls around, slowly but obviously agitated. And sometimes he bolts like a streak of furry lightning. And from what I understand, my hamorii is one of the most relaxed species. And really, I #8217;m mostly scared *for* him when we #8217;re forced to interact. Not of him. He #8217;s a dangerous predator in his little world, but he #8217;s a fragile little fuzz ball in mine! A fall from the counter where his cage sits would be like my falling from a 10-story building! And if he crawled onto my hand and bit me out of fear or overzealous feeding response, would I have the willpower to just accept the bite? Or would I jerk my hand and fling him against the wall? So I limit and plan my interactions, and I try to set up safety precautions when I do open the cage. But I #8217;m not a nervous person. Pretty fearless, really, when it comes to critters. And so I wonder about the people who get tarantulas despite having arachnophobia, or as a type of therapy to treat it. I just see way too much opportunity for things to go poorly. And it won #8217;t be the person who suffers, even though they consciously decided to get a spider despite their fear. It #8217;ll be the spider, who will be neglected or dropped or rehomed.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>The type of airlock that you linked is definitely easier to clean. I do have one gripe with it, though: if the gas in your fermentation ever reverses into negative pressure, it can suck the liquid from the airlock into the ferment. Best case scenario, that #8217;s stale or dirty water. But I often use sanitizing liquid in my airlock, which could be really bad. The S-type works the same whether under positive or negative pressure, and will never backflow into your food or drink.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>By the time the sensory impulse of hearing the gunshot reaches the brain and turns into a motor impulse, the bullet is already traveling past the person  #8220;catching #8221; it. The length of time it takes the nervous system to move the fingers all the way out at the end of the arm makes this trick impossible. The only way to do it properly without sleight of hand (palming a bullet) is to catch it in your teeth. Less distance for the nerve impulse to travel, and a much tougher catching surface than your soft hands.</TEXT>

This plant is the largest one of several in the yard, and is only about knee-high. This is its first year with multiple fruits. Last year it made one little berry that was a bit more red than most blueberries. Also, the  #8220;crown #8221; at the bottom is a bit smaller than most of the local blueberries I #8217;ve seen.

    <TEXT>Any yeast will make hard cider. Your ginger bug will do the trick, or baker #8217;s yeast as well. But it most likely won #8217;t be optimal for the alcohol level and flavor profile if you #8217;re looking to make *really good* cider. To that effect, I wouldn #8217;t use champagne yeast, either. Champagne yeast is very aggressive and tolerates high levels of alcohol; it #8217;ll quickly eat up all the sugar in your cider and leave it extremely dry and boozy. But if that #8217;s what you #8217;re looking for... I #8217;d google  #8220;best yeast for cider #8221;. That #8217;ll give you a good list, and probably a few recipes. Depends how technical you want to get. Otherwise if you just want to make something drinkable with some booze in it, your ginger bug will be an easy, all natural option.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>The water is not so bad, and it #8217;s not a very tall bridge. But like the article says, it #8217;s miles long. And depending on several conditions, the waves and tidal currents can be anywhere from mild to brutal. So imagine jumping in and being either swept out into the bay, or driven into the pilings under the bridge. Now you have to swim a mile or two to shore, and the only structure you can hang onto to stop and rest is covered in razor-sharp oysters and barnacles. I grew up in the bay, and I #8217;ve jumped off a small bridge or two. But you couldn #8217;t pay me enough to jump off the Howard Frankenstein unless I had a buddy waiting in a boat.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>This sword has apparently been in my family for generations. It has always been called the  #8220;Civil War Sword #8221;, but nothing is really known about its origins. My grandpa had it for some decades, and he #8217;s a dealer of antiques and collectibles. He has had a few people look at it. It #8217;s confirmed that this type of sword was often carried by officers in the Civil War, but a few were also created for officers who carried them in the Spanish-American War. What #8217;s weird is that the inscription on the blade, just above the hilt, reads  #8220;Eisenhower #8221;. I #8217;m not aware of being related to any Eisenhowers, but honestly there #8217;s not much record of my family history. Does anyone here have any more info on this type of sword, or suggestions where I might learn a little more? Since this is a family heirloom that I intend to keep passing down, it would be great to gather as much info as possible before it becomes lost to time.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I #8217;ve been looking into this, too. I live just south of Tampa. I may not keep any, because I just really don #8217;t think I want more than the one tarantula I already have. But I honestly don #8217;t see a problem removing as many as you want. First, I read an online discussion about the Ft Pierce population; a person gave explicit directions to the site, because there was no way a person who was collecting for  #8220;personal use #8221; could even put a dent in the number of spiders. The population was extremely high, at least as recently as I could find information about it. Second, they #8217;re not  #8220;supposed #8221; to be there. It #8217;s like brown anoles, feral hogs, or the Burmese pythons in the Everglades. Short of animal cruelty, I #8217;m cool with people removing them by any means necessary. And if the last ones are someday removed from the wild in Florida, that #8217;s a good thing.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I #8217;ve used Premier Cuvee and Pasteur interchangeably for home brewing with no noticeable difference. I think that for our small batch  #8220;rudimentary #8221; fermentations, we won #8217;t really see enough of a difference for it to matter. There are too many variables in our recipes from batch to batch to pin down a difference between such similar yeast strains. Where we #8217;ll see a difference will be in using bread yeast vs. wild-captured, ale, wine, champagne, or turbo yeasts. I will say, as a matter of my own opinion, I probably wouldn #8217;t enjoy champagne yeast in a ginger beer or tepache. It #8217;ll be very dry, very strongly carbonated, and super boozy. Even my down-n-dirty ginger beer recipe with a reasonably  #8220;gentle #8221; wine yeast can turn this way if it #8217;s not consumed within about two weeks.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I #8217;ve heard of people using three different techniques to work around your problem of pepper availability. First you could freeze the peppers until you have enough to ferment a whole batch. If you do this, I speculate that you #8217;d want to use at least a few of the peppers fresh, so the microbes are healthier and more active than if they #8217;d been frozen for a long time. Second, you can add fresh peppers to an active ferment. You #8217;ll have to make sure you maintain the brine #8217;s salt ratio, and you risk introducing unwanted microbes each time you open the jar. But I #8217;ve heard lots of people do this. Last, and probably my preferred method, you can just ferment very small batches and save them in the freezer until you have enough. Or even just let them keep fermenting! Tabasco ferments their peppers for three to five years!</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Yeah man, no sweat. I used to work wait staff in food service, just a few minutes #8217; drive from Fort DeSoto where OP #8217;s pic was taken. And at first I was pissed at the tips I got from my cheap-ass Canadian tourists. But then I learned that tips are barely even a thing in Canada (and most countries) because the staff are paid a reasonable wage and tips are only a gift for appreciating above-average attention. That #8217;s why, when my family started a restaurant, we paid our entire staff enough to pay their bills. And on top of that, we split tips evenly from servers to line cooks and prep cooks and dishwashers. Because everyone in our restaurant was responsible for our guests #8217; experience. And every one of them deserved to pay their bills by working hard, and to get extra by making their product special. To be fair though, I really am pretty insufferable. That had a lot to do with why we had to pay them so much. Like, I have absolutely zero sense of humor, and I #8217;m completely incapable of self-deprecation. And I also have a hard time admitting that people are right when they point out on the internet that I #8217;m being stuffy and obnoxious. ;P It has been a good evening.

    <TEXT>Hydrogen sulfide is what you #8217;re smelling; it #8217;s a common issue in brewing with yeast. Some common triggers that produce it are stresses on the yeast. High brewing temps, cold crashing, running out of sugar to consume, etc. can cause it. Also, unfortunately, some yeast strains are just prone to creating hydrogen sulfide. It can be removed by letting the brew breathe for a few days, but unfortunately you #8217;ll lose all your carbonated fizz along with it.</TEXT>

    <TITLE>Is Florida Prince peach grafted?</TITLE>
    <DATE>2020-08-13 21:23:22</DATE>
    <TEXT>We bought a small Florida Prince peach last spring, and it did fairly well up until the beginning of July. We had to go out of town during a stretch of extremely hot, dry weather. The lil tree was scorched by the time we got back. We watered it in hopes that it would come back, but to no avail. A few weeks later I trimmed all the dead wood, clipping further and further, hoping I #8217;d hit green wood. Nope. Deadwood all the way to the ground. Darn. But now, weeks later, I #8217;m seeing new peach shoots coming up out of the ground. I know that many/most fruit trees are grafted. Does anyone here know whether Florida Prince is typically grafted? If so, I #8217;m guessing it #8217;s the rootstock that #8217;s pushing up. So I #8217;m wondering whether this might be the FL Prince growing from its own roots or, if not, how desirable the rootstock might be. How likely is it that this plant will give us tasty fruit?</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Word. I gotta hand it mostly to my wife #8212; she saw this coming well before anyone in the US was really talking about it. She went out grocery shopping, and I remember her being kind of embarrassed. She said,  #8220;Hey, have you heard about this coronavirus thing? It sounds kind of scary, and it #8217;s starting to spread outside of China. I was thinking I should maybe stock up on some stuff in case we #8217;re quarantined #8212; lots of canned food, Theraflu, sanitizer, masks, gloves, that kind of stuff. It might be kind of expensive, but I think it could be good to have on hand. Just in case. Or am I being alarmist? #8221; I figured that it sounded like a good idea, and a week later I asked her,  #8220;Hey, for some reason they #8217;re panic-buying toilet paper in Australia. Like, there #8217;s a shortage. Do you mind if I buy a stupid amount of TP just in case? #8221; And that #8217;s how we survived the TP shortage of 2020 and wound up with a fuckton of extra canned food, BECAUSE WE NEVER DID A PROPER QUARANTINE IN OUR COUNTRY FULL OF SCIENCE-DENYING IDIOTS.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>First, the possibility of your being tied to a murder or other crime is BS. Yep, they might look at you as a result of multiple  #8220;suspicious activity #8221; calls, but there still has to be evidence to link you to the crime before they could even begin to bring charges. The cop was just trying to intimidate you. He probably could tell that you #8217;re an intelligent person and an upstanding citizen, and decided to use (admittedly twisted) logic to scare you rather than just flexing his badge and telling you to go home. Where you *could* potentially see some actual trouble, assuming you #8217;re staying in public areas and not trespassing at all, is cruising in your car. Some municipalities or specific roads have minimum speed limits. Even if not, if you #8217;re creeping down the road at an unreasonable rate for normal travel, they might try to write you up for some kind of reckless driving charge or similar. Beyond that, in the middle of the night there #8217;s also the possibility of a sleepy or impaired driver slamming into you, because they didn #8217;t realize you were going so slow. Otherwise, yeah, the cop was just annoyed that he has been called twice for no reason, and was just trying to bully you.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Yeah, the penis plant contains mescaline, the same drug found in peyote, as well as a few other alkaloids that have their own effects. Some of the alkaloids are psychedelic on their own, others boost/alter the effects of the mescaline. While it doesn #8217;t contain as much mesc by weight as peyote cactus, some experts and  #8220;cactus journey enthusiasts #8221; argue that the penis plant is potentially stronger than peyote due to the combined effects of its alkaloids. I can #8217;t speak from experience, but if you #8217;re interested (even just for curiosity #8217;s sake), what you have is Trichocereus bridgesii monstrose, a cousin of the popular San Pedro cactus. There are lots of articles online, as well as a few subreddits and Facebook groups dedicated to these interesting cacti. Good luck growing yours, they #8217;re very cool!</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Ya know, everyone here dreads the idea of their sling turning out to be male. And I get it to a degree #8212; I #8217;d rather have my spider 30 years from now than watch it die in 5. But that #8217;s kinda a nasty, negative view to have, and I t #8217;s going to cast a shadow on the rest of the time you have with your T. First off, I was absolutely flabbergasted when I did my research and learned that, depending which species I got, my spider might be alive for decades. Even the 5-7 years of a male was on the outside range of what I had expected. Second, these are fascinating animals with intricate life cycles. If you #8217;re going to appreciate a tarantula who spends decades in a burrow guarding generations of babies, then you also ought to appreciate the intrepid tarantula who seeks her out to mate. He undergoes major physical changes, and dedicates the last bit of his life to finding a mate who might kill him. That #8217;s pretty cool. I don #8217;t feel bad that my little guy is a guy, I just appreciate him a little differently than I would if I knew he #8217;d be around when I turn 65. No F in the chat for him.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>The jar won #8217;t break as long as you have an airlock. But the gunk in the airlock is bad. The lock serves two purposes: to relieve the pressure that would explode the jar, and to keep out unwanted microbes. Once the cider has  #8220;puked #8221; its way up into the airlock, bad germs can make their way backward through the lock and into the jar. You didn #8217;t have enough empty headspace in the jar to account for the foam (very common for first timers, and especially small batches in this type of jar). If it #8217;s continuing to foam and expand, I #8217;d replace the airlock with a hose that drains into your sink or another container. Once it #8217;s settled, sanitize the airlock and put it back.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Sure can! I #8217;m not a huge fan of completely opening the lid on an active fermentation, because it increases the chances of airborne mold spores or other yuckies getting into the brew. But I #8217;ve done it more than a few times in my last 15 years of brewing, and never had a problem. Your cider is obviously very active, with a pretty aggressive yeast strain, and so it #8217;s a difficult environment for  #8220;bad #8221; bugs to get a foothold. If possible, maybe use a thoroughly cleaned and sanitized turkey baster to remove the cider. That way none will slop around the rim of the jar and provide an environment for nasty buggers to start growing. (I #8217;m maybe just a little overzealous with sanitary procedure, but I #8217;ve never lost a brew or fermented food to contamination.)</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Rapid, shallow breathing isn #8217;t helpful in this way #8212; that #8217;s true hyperventilating. It #8217;s bad. But measured, deep breaths can absolutely charge the bloodstream with oxygen and allow a person more time before they have to take their next breath, or before they start feeling the effects of holding their breath. I #8217;ve used this to my advantage when free-diving for spearfishing and scalloping. I also use it when I #8217;m shooting precision long-range, because breathing can affect your shot placement, but hypoxia affects your vision. When I #8217;m not under a time constraint, I charge my blood with oxygen and then don #8217;t take a breath until I #8217;ve pulled the trigger.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>What this person says is 100% accurate, and should be the standard when people talk about brine salinity percentage. And uuuuusually it is. But sometimes in a recipe, people who advise on a 3% brine (or whatever) are talking about just the salt:water ratio and don #8217;t account for the food being fermented. Strangely, I #8217;ve had success with a completely unscientific method #8212; the sweet hippie lady who first taught me about fermentation recommended a brine that  #8220;tastes about as salty as seawater, if you #8217;re familiar with it #8220;. Being intimately familiar with the taste of seawater, that #8217;s what I #8217;ve done for my kraut, hot sauce, and fermented Smilax tendrils.

    <TEXT>The reason you can #8217;t find a recipe is because it doesn #8217;t exist. The recipe for making a spontaneous scoby is the same as any other kombucha recipe, except that you replace an already-existing scoby culture with an insane amount of good luck. Finding the right combination of types and concentrations of microbes to create a stable, healthy (and tasty) culture would be so incredibly unlikely that you might as well call it impossible. The reason people use already-existing cultures is not laziness, it #8217;s just that they want to make kombucha and not toxic fungus tea. I once read a similar question regarding milk kefir: How do I make kefir grains from scratch if I don #8217;t have a culture to start from? One person commented that they #8217;d be just as likely for their milk to grow into a cow as it would be to grow into kefir grains. Same applies here.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>SCOBY: Symbiotic Culture Of Bacteria and Yeast. In other words, a starter culture. In both kombucha and milk kefir, the solid matter is just a buildup of cellulose and other gunk called a pellicle. There #8217;s a strong concentration of the desirable microbes on the pellicle, but the  #8220;culture #8221; or  #8220;scoby #8221; is actually the entire batch, both liquid and solid. Lots of times a  #8216;bucha pellicle is referred to as the scoby, but that #8217;s not completely accurate. So whether you #8217;re buying a single-use package of powdered microbes, buying some goopy milk kefir grains, buying unpasteurized kombucha from the grocery store, or getting a pellicle/scoby from a friend, you #8217;re using a starter culture. Now, you can make some sweet tea and see what grows. You #8217;ll grow some kind of culture for sure. But what are the odds that you #8217;ll just randomly grow something that #8217;s a) not toxic, b) tasty, and c) stable? Pretty astronomical.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I know it #8217;s tough now, being ready for lots of responsibility and wanting to try the awesome things that are available in the world, yet still being treated like a child a lot of the time. But believe me, getting any kind of pet behind your parents #8217; back is not a reasonable response. If anything, it #8217;ll only show your dad that he #8217;s right about your maturity level and ability to handle responsibility. Your best bet, I think, is to sit down and write him a letter reassuring him about his problems with the tarantula. Make him aware how easy they are to keep, plan out a maintenance schedule that shows him how you #8217;ll be able to do all of the care yourself. Provide info on how *not* dangerous they are. I did this a few times as a teenager #8212; by writing a letter that clearly addresses all your points, you have the opportunity to say everything you want without being interrupted or talked over, and without your emotions rising during the conversation and making your point seem less valid because you #8217;re upset. In addition to the letter, you could also buy a nice setup for whatever species you want to keep, but put a fake rubber spider in it. Keep it for a few weeks and then let him know,  #8220;Look, I #8217;ve had this set up for a while now. If I had a real tarantula it would be exactly the same for you, but I #8217;d get the enjoyment of caring for a live spider. #8221; Then if he agrees, you already have your setup ready! But if all that fails, unfortunately you gotta just let it go. You may not be able to respect his reasoning, but it #8217;d be really rude and irresponsible not to respect that it #8217;s his house, and he doesn #8217;t want tarantulas in it. Parents aren #8217;t always right. They often make rules that deserve to be broken. But this isn #8217;t that kind of situation. At least take solace in the fact that in just a few years, you can have whatever pets you want for the rest of your life. It seems far off now, but trust me, it goes by *quickly*.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Sure! It #8217;s 1/3 cup cold butter cut into pieces, 2 cups self-rising flour, and 3/4 cup active kefir. Gently fold the butter into the flour, then mix in the kefir until the dough is a consistent texture but the butter pieces aren #8217;t blended in. The dough should NOT be completely homogenous. Then it needs to sit at room temperature for at least two hours, or let it go overnight in the fridge. Bake at 400F 13-15 minutes. Makes about 8 biscuits. I also make big batches and freeze them for convenience: 3.75 sticks butter, 10 cups self rising flour, 1 quart kefir. Usually makes about 30-40 biscuits, depending how big I roll them. Bake at 400F for 15 min, then switch from bake to broil for 5-10 to make the tops golden brown. I find that if I start heating up my egg pan after 10 minutes of baking, then start cooking eggs as I switch from bake to broil, the biscuits and eggs are usually perfectly done at the same time.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Hey, come on. That #8217;s a *stainless slide* Taurus G2C, which costs *at least* $239 plus tax and a background check. And in the current market, your buddy might have paid upwards of $300 for that gun. Or at least, he knows a person who had enough money to buy it. And that counts for something.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>That was my first guess, but check out the trigger guard. The SDVE is curved toward the grip, the Taurus is a hard 90 degree with a little bit of a spur. I #8217;m always happy to clown on a Steve, but the nice thing about a Taurus is that they come with their own clown.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I used to not talk smack about Taurus guns. Sure, they weren #8217;t the slickest pistols available. And for every Smith  amp; Wesson or Ruger that we sent back for warranty repair, we sent back at least 10 Tauruses. Not to mention, every previous version of the G3/G3C/G2C/G2S has had a recall for safety hazards (PT111/ Millennium/ G2). But for the most part they worked, and they were inexpensive, and they had a lifetime warranty. If your Taurus broke or didn #8217;t work from the day you bought it, you just sent it back to them. Two or three months later, you had a gun that worked perfectly. But they canceled that lifetime warranty. They changed it to one year *from the date it was manufactured*. Which is obviously bullshit. So they flip-flopped again, and went back to lifetime as far as safety and function of the gun, but you only get a year on the grip, sights, finish, and magazine. And man, their warranty department has fallen to shit. You send a gun in... and then eventually you get a gun back? Even pre-COVID, it became impossible to talk to a human and get any kind of status update or ETA. I #8217;ve had multiple customers get fed up and just buy new guns while they waited for their G2C to come back from warranty limbo. But hey, when they work, they #8217;re a great pistol for the price point. I don #8217;t knock anyone who likes their Taurus.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Seconded. I slow-cooked a wild pork shoulder back in June, and it was the best meat I #8217;ve ever cooked. I had saved up about a quart of brine, added half each of a rough-chopped onion and green pepper, and marinated it for 24 hours. I then rubbed it down with half a stick of soft butter, because the hog had been pretty lean. I put it into a large baking pan covered with foil. Baked at 250F for 2.5 hours, flipping the leg halfway through. Then I shredded the meat, put it into smaller pie pans, and smoked it at low heat for another half hour with oak and pecan. It was the most tender, flavorful meat I #8217;ve ever had. I provided a few different barbecue sauces, but it was just fine without any additional sauce.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Unfortunately, you specifically cannot use live plants in a cage the size that you #8217;ve described. If you provide lighting that will keep plants alive, your spider will be stressed out if it somehow manages to survive the heat. If you provide lighting that #8217;s acceptable for your spider, the plants will slowly die from lack of light. It sounds like you want to prioritize the tarantula #8217;s health in this situation, so you should use fake plants or be willing to sacrifice live ones. In that case, use whatever plant you like. I #8217;m not a tarantula expert, but I #8217;ve been growing plants indoors and in terraria for about 20 years. I #8217;d love for my tarantulas to have real desert plants in their cage, but it #8217;s not something that can happen without a massive cage and a ridiculous budget. It #8217;ll be best to control fungus problems by providing appropriate moisture levels.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>It depends. If you #8217;re making a whole bunch that won #8217;t be consumed soon, then yeah #8212; you #8217;ll want to pasteurize it and make sure it #8217;s acidic enough to stay stable, and put it into sanitized bottles. It #8217;s best to do this if you #8217;re selling it or giving it out as gifts, since you don #8217;t know how the people will store it, or how long it #8217;ll take them to use up the bottle. On the other hand, I make small batches that are going to be used up in the next month or two. Once they #8217;re blended, I just keep them refrigerated. The sauce is continuing to ferment, so it might taste just a little different from the day I make it to the day I use up the last drop. But it #8217;s still delicious, so I don #8217;t go to the trouble of pasteurization.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I #8217;ve done these flavors by adding the fruit or juice to the primary fermentation: orange-ginger, mulberry, mixed wild berry, watermelon, and strawberry. I did not like the strawberry; the others were phenomenal and I #8217;ve made each one several times. One of the most popular batches I #8217;ve made was blueberry-vanilla. In a 6.5 gallon carboy I fermented one gallon of honey with the strained and pasteurized juice of one gallon of mashed blueberries (and the rest water). In the secondary I added 2 or 3 whole organic vanilla beans that had been dipped in vodka to sanitize them. Then stabilize, clarify, and add one pint of honey to back-sweeten.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Hmm. It #8217;s been a few years, but I do know that the honey was a springtime wildflower harvest from the Tampa Bay area. I never got a harvest quite like that one; the honey was moderately dark and extremely thick, and had a slight cherry flavor with an unexpected salty/buttery finish. I guess that any wildflower honey would be kind of close, or a 70/30 mix of orange blossom and buckwheat might get you somewhere in the neighborhood. The blueberries were just mashed and minimally pasteurized. There was a little more than a gallon of whole berries, and I strained them through some kind of colander. It must have been just a plastic pasta strainer, because I didn #8217;t lose much mass to wasted pulp. I do remember adding a little water to the berries during pasteurization to prevent scorching. Additional notes if you plan to try it: The yeast was Lalvin 71B. I cut each vanilla bean lengthwise twice, to release the flavor inside. Initial fermentation was 3-4 weeks, until there was a 30-second gap between bubbles through the airlock. Then I racked it off the lees and fermented another two weeks. The vanilla was in for the final week. Then I stabilized with sorbate and added one pint of honey for backsweetening, and two days later clarified with kieselsol and chitosan. A few days later I bottled. Seriously, it was like drinking blueberry muffins.</TEXT>
