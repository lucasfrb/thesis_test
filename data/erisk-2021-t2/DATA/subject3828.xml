    <TEXT>Zero mission Am2r Fusion Super Again like many. I love all of these. But I'm going by gameplay feel. Zero mission has the tightest, and intuitive control scheme. Am2r borrows a LOT from zero missions asthetics I love the atmosphere and difficulty of fusion but it does feel a little stiff and slow comparatively. Also. Fusion was my first Super is amazing but I fight with the controller constantly. It's annoying to have to cycle through my items to get to the super missiles or grapple beam.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I was literally just thinking about this. Httydragon 1 is a story about a boy and his pet. Finding his place in the world, earning acceptance from his family (if you count the village as his extended family) and knowing when you were wrong Dragon 2 is so much heavier of a story. It's a story about ruiniting with lost loved ones, losing loved ones, dealing with forces that go against what you believe in, stepping up to lead, it's kind of lion king esque. At the end of the day if I had to pick one that I'd rather sit down and watch to enjoy. It's 1. But 2 is so much deeper and advanced of a story. And then 3 is.... Ehhh I have problems with 3</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Unseen Depths is amazing! You can get really powerful attacks for 1-2 energies. Don't be shy about discarding cards. Ambipom does up to 120, 60 for each card discarded. Golduck returns and energy to your hand and if you combo this with Draw Energy you get an extra card each turn. Kyogre returns energies from the discard and Empoleon lets you do 80 for 1 energy. The deck is evenly balanced. Black And White decks seemed really unbalanced to me but these ones rock! The only thing I don't love is the trainer selection, but they are servicable.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I'm having a hard time finding synergy amung the cards I pulled. There's not a lot of quick aggro affect, a lot of it is based on "this thing does this thing but only if this thing is tapped and then put a counter on this thing but then do this thing instead" like, it's just too much. Cycling is not fun. I want to play cards, not cycle them. You spend mana to cycle a card so now you don't have the mana to play the card you pulled anyway. Mutate idk if I'm just not doing it right but either it's too slow to pull off succesfully or the mutate effects just really don't play well.

    <TEXT>I'm still tweaking it so it will change but this is essentially what I'm using.

I got the idea Kaya's ultimate to deal damage for each card in their exile. I haven't gotten to use it yet but that's why it's W/U/B. This could easily work as just a W/U too. Kaya doesn't really need to be here.</TEXT>

Also the other kaya card was a 6 mana to exile a creature, kinda too late in the game to be useful. But Ashiok has been doing wonders.</TEXT>

And I just had this idea that we were both there, smoking together looking at the sunset. And I amagined how she looked silloetted and and the sun was glowing behind her. Like atmospheric pleasure, I guess. but idk. There was nothing sexual going on. She wasn't nude. We weren't into each other. But just that moment was enough to get my off. I don't understand.

    <TEXT>My first male sexual partner was in college. I was totally into guys and dicks and wanted to try everything. After i gave him his first kiss i was already jerking him off. And i did that like everyday for the next month. We tried butt stuff but that never worked out well and i was never able to get off from someone else touching me so... I had a thing with a girl in highschool in the girls bathroom. I touched her boobs and she sucked me. But it never went anywhere. And i didnt really feel much from it. So i dont really count that. But my first sex with a girl is the person im currently living with. And we are both ace but wanted to try it. And we did it. Got it out of our system and now we are both perfectly content with masturbation.</TEXT>

    <DATE>2020-07-08 12:46:10</DATE>
    <TEXT>I used to hate counter spells but I learned recently that they are almost necesary to keep my deck alive. Also, given that my deck has a lot of flyers, cards like Winged Words and Gust of Wind work a lot better than Radical Idea or Unsummon. Lava Coil and Shocks are still great removals especially in early game. Crackling Drake is great late in game when you already have a bunch of inst/sorc in your graveyard and Niv-Mizzet is just a great powerful 5/5 flyer that benefits from drawing cards and playing spells. The only downside is that especially late in the game, Niv Mizzet is really easy to remove. That's where Keep Safe is great for. I would Sideboard keep safe with Negate but Essense Scatter is almost always useful. Spectral Sailor is just a cheap i mana 1/1 flyer that you can cast out early, gives Winged Words and Gust of Wind a cheaper mana cost, and is great for drawing cards later in the game. It does cost 4 but you don't have to tap it. Having 2 Izzet Lockets is pretty good. 3 is a bit much I learned. Other than that, I'm not totally loving Cloudkin seer, If it's defense was higher it would be more useful but 3 mana for a 2/1 flying to draw a card is a bit meh.  #8203; "Spark of Genius" 3 Shock (M20) 160 4 Swiftwater Cliffs (M20) 252 9 Mountain (UND) 94 3 Crackling Drake (GRN) 163 11 Island (UND) 90 3 Opt (ELD) 59 4 Sprite Dragon (IKO) 211 2 Niv-Mizzet, Parun (GRN) 192 2 Gust of Wind (IKO) 54 2 Cloudkin Seer (M20) 54 2 Izzet Locket (GRN) 238 2 Radical Idea (GRN) 52 2 Lava Coil (GRN) 108 2 Essence Scatter (IKO) 49 2 Winged Words (M20) 80 2 Beacon Bolt (GRN) 154 2 Keep Safe (IKO) 56 3 Spectral Sailor (M20) 76</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Do you ever have a night where whatever deck you play or cards you 'sideboard' in you can't seem to make it work? I saw someone play a working satyr deck so I thought I would rebuild my satyr deck and it didn't work out as well for me as it did for them. And then my Divine Angels deck. I can never get my Divine Visitation out quick enough to out-power my opponent. Then my black/white cat/vampire deck is really hit or miss. I can never get the combo pieces to perform in quick enough or in the right order. Sometimes, I feel like I just get really lucky. Or I'm just rushing it and not planning out my plays well enough. Either way. I think I will put magic away for a bit and try again later. I'm pretty tired.</TEXT>

    <TITLE>Izzet Counter Update</TITLE>
    <DATE>2020-07-13 23:35:38</DATE>
    <TEXT>So I have been building the "ultimate" Izzet Standard deck by adding certain counter spells. And I discovered a charming card from M21 called Lofty Denial. It's a 1U that counters any spell unless the opponent taps 1 but if you control a flyer they need to tap 4. It works well for early in the game and if it's late in the game they are casting big spells and probably won't have 4 to spare. Also, I had an issue with Lava Coil. 1R to deal 4 damage to a creature and exile it is appealing but it's very limiting to creatures and left me defenseless against Planeswalkers. So I substituted it with slaying fire and it has been doing so much better for me!</TEXT>

When game grumps first started they went through a bunch of Games they knew front to back and were really good at so that they could focus on the commentary and comedy. But not understanding a game and them blaming the game for his mistakes just gets really old after a while.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I understand where youre coming from. To be fair especially lately. Covid has a pretty hard on everyone and they are taking it very seriously. I do get dry spells from them now and then where they get into a series i dont care about or the jokes/stories just arent there. But eventually that will change. Like in their Megaman 11 playthrough where Dan talks about performing on Conan. And recently some gems came from their sonic Heroes ep 15. Names Arin screaming  #8220;why do you warch game grumps. Stop it #8221; and Dan inventing the hip young phrase  #8220;beefy tea #8221; My girlfriend and I both watch them regularly (thank god i found someone who also likes Game Grumps) and those were our favorite bits lately. Doing episodes apart lately feels weird. Because before Arin would freak out and you get Dans reaction to it but lately Dan either cant react in time or its lost in the tiny box on his screen.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>First of all. I did say the whole shuffle thing was just my theory. Idk how programming works. In thinking when you edit a deck the list of numbers your deck is in goes back to 1-2-3-4 and so on and then the game after that. After one algorithmic shuffle would be like 52-53-2-3-7-8 and just getting clumps of cards together. Idk man. If there was some Nigerian witch doctor who could give me the perfecr shuffled deck I would gladly drink a mixture of newt sweat and blue spotted shrooms to make that work.</TEXT>

    <TITLE>Weis Points (From a sales associate)</TITLE>
    <DATE>2020-07-24 09:45:48</DATE>
    <TEXT>Okay. So previously, you had to "swipe" your weis card to get your points. But swiping doesn't work anymore and will actually mess up the sale. The only way to get your points is to scan the bar code. But the instructions that are posted on the gas pumps are outdated and still say to swipe the card. After that though, the screen that says "do you want to use your X points? Yes / No" People don't realize that the "Yes" and "No" button correspond to the white buttons next to the screen. They try to hit the buttons on the keypad, which do nothing. Needless to say I get a LOT of angry weis customers who aren't able to get their points for one of those two main reasons. I wish they would update the on screen / written instructions to reflect to new Wies procedures. Or program the pinpad buttons to work with the yes/no option. But no matter how many times I mention it to my managers, they never pass the word on to higher ups. When I have the time or an extra person at register, I will go out there and show the customer step by step the right procedure. But I don't always have the time or availability to do that. Please, just update the instructions.</TEXT>

    <TITLE>Credit/Debit procedure rant</TITLE>
    <DATE>2020-07-24 10:01:40</DATE>
    <TEXT>From a sales associate. I've worked at sheetz for 3-4 years now and before, when a customer used a credit/debit card, it would tell them if it went through before taking their card out. But now, they take their card out, I hit the accept button and wait, and THEN it says if it went through or not. More times then not, the customer is already out the door before I get the confirmation that the card worked. And on very rare occassions but definitely more often than I'm comfortable with. The customer leaves, and it tells me 1. their pin was wrong, 2. their card didn't pay for the whole total, or 3. it just straight up failed. 1. How do you not know your pin. 2. Why do cards allow the sale to go through without being able to pay for the whole sale? 3. Why are you allowed to take your card out before telling the customer if the sale went through or not? Then, when a customer starts to leave and I yell at them to come back because the register isn't finished processing, and it goes through, then I just look like an jerk. This new card procedure didn't start until like 6 months ago. Why did it change? Can we change it back?</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Sleeving: I just picked up a pack of Dragon Shield pefect fit resealable and OMG I love them! But I don't want to double sleeve every single card in every single deck. Is it okay to just double sleeve the most expensive cards like Omniscience and Embercleave? Deck Management: How do you managing decks that share multiple cards like duel-lands, mana-rocks, and just decks with similar themes? I can buy multiple copies of commons and uncommons but getting into Rares and Mythics buying multiples to fit every deck gets pretty expensive! I want to take care of my cards but I also have a budget!</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Thank you all for the advive. It's my understanding that it's pretty much all or nothing when double sleeving. It's not quite in my budget to double sleeve all my decks. Even single sleeving is getting a little tight. I either use Ultra Pro eclipse or Dragon Shields. It's best to buy 3 of a kind since 300 sleeves can sleeve either 5 - 60 card decks / 4 - 75 card decks or / 3 - 100 card decks. leaving very little behind. Black is too plain for me to use for all my decks. A darker purple is more my style and both Dragon Shield and Eclipse have a pleasant purple color.</TEXT>

Anytime anyone says  #8220;first ones #8221; or  #8220;first ones tech #8221; I mean. I get it. But they say it way too often for my liking How many times She Ras powers randomly decide to not work. Also. I dont think her powers were ever really addressed. Which im totally fine with. Im cool learning things through seeing them in action. Not everything needs and expo dump or a flashback. But maybe. What are she ras limitations. They set up Bows and Glimmers limitations well. I think thats it. Nitpicks mostly. Just wanted to address them.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I could see that in a way A Link to the Past was kind of a reimagining of the original Zelda. The 8-bit era had a lot of limitations to work around, but the super nintendo opened up a lot of possibility, so I am sure they wanted to perfect their ideas from the 1st generation with fewer limitations but also adding to the story they already set up. Making it a sequel would possibly direct people to the sourse and making the original Metroid and Zelda relevent still.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Personally, I've loved every classic art sleeve I bought. I mistakingly got 3 sets of the Valentine version (the one with the dragon presenting a heart) and also one with a dragon flying over a field and love them both! They have the best shuffle feel and the artwork is really well done. I've got sets of matte sleeves as well and... those left a sour taste in my mouth. One was a holiday special with a dragon peering into a window. Those were so curved that they permanently warped the commander deck I sleeved with them. And the other, the 2020 valentine special, had a constant gluey smell that I never smelled before. So personally... I would go with classic art sleeves. I'm also considering only getting classic sleeves from now on. I've been having mixed to worse experiences with the matte sleeves I pick up but I picked up a classic blue pack and it's my new favorite!</TEXT>

    <TITLE>Blitz of the Thunder Raptor vs Beacon Bolt</TITLE>
    <DATE>2020-09-04 13:19:30</DATE>
    <TEXT>Blitz is essentially just a better Beacon Bolt. Where Beacon Bolt was a 1UR that dealt X damage to target creature for each instant an sorcery in your graveyard/exile, Blitz is a 1R that does X damage to target Creature OR planeswalker for each instant and sorcery in your graveyard, then if it dies, it gets exiled. Like.. Blitz is infinantly better than beacon bolt. It costs 1 less, can target planeswalkers and can exile it. Is this too much power for its cost? For 1R you typically see "Does 3 damage and scry" or "does 3 damage but if you paid RRR it does 4" or "Does 3 damage and exile target" but having it do X damage, AND exiling AND targeting planeswalkers it just feels like too much for a 1R card.</TEXT>

I don't really care for the cardboard ones that come in packs and I want to use colored pebbles to represent them.

Or, if there is a company out there that is making higher quality ability counters, I would totally snatch those up! Thoughts?</TEXT>

    <TEXT>That's a good point. I totally forgot about Jump-Start when evaluating the cards. And you are likely to play both later in the game when you have a bunch of cards in the graveyard so is that 1 mana difference really that big of an advantage. Flavorwise, if I'm playing izzet I would totally spring for Beacon Bolt where a Blitz would be more suited towards a mono red that plays a lot of instants/sorceries. Here's a question. When you have a creature with an adventure in your graveyard, do you count that towards the instant/sorcery cost?</TEXT>

    <TITLE>Increasing disappointment with Dragon Shield / sleeve burnout</TITLE>
    <DATE>2020-09-05 00:06:07</DATE>
    <TEXT>My first and favorite sleeves where the night blue. I bought them for my Izzet commander deck and, while I disliked how thick it made my deck, I got used to shuffling it (half a deck at a time) and I still use them for my casual izzet deck. But, I have been buying packs of different colors that either shuffle very poorly, are super slippery, or are painfully transparent in the back. I bought a pack of tangerines today, I put a card in backwards and I could clearly read the card. I love the colors selection. I love that the front is 100% transparent. but I hate dropping $11 on a pack of sleeves and having it be poor quality. Pink, Yellow, Magenta, Blue was completely opaque but had a poor shuffle feel. The problem is, all of my LGSs sell dragon shields (and most are mattes only) Actually, the last pack of sleeves I bought that I liked were. Well, the Olives were really good. I want more of those. And the classic blues were good too. Maybe I should just get classics instead of Matte. But most of my LGSs only carry Mattes. I feel I would have better luck with Utra Pro Eclipses where I have been consistantly getting sleeves with consistantly smooth shuffle feel and all the colors are %100 opaque. I even liked the set of art sleeves I bought a while for a draft. They were sticky but I like that my 100 card commander deck isn't sliding around when I'm trying to play. I don't know. I just feel burnt out on buying sleeves and ending up not liking them. Actually, I'm burnt out on sleeves in general. I spend so much time and money on sleeving cards. They aren't even that valuable. The deck I play the most is $30 at the most, even with the guild kit lands and Promo variants of Sprite Dragon. I have 2 $10 Battle Decks that I sleeved with $11 dragon shields. And the rest of the 40 sleeves go unused. What's the point. I honestly like cards that have some wear. They are loved and played. I never put a case on my phone. I have the way cases make my phone feels. And now, I'm not liking how sleeves make my cards feel. I can switch all my dragon shields to eclipses but that'll be like a $60-$90 sink if they are all the same color. Which color would I pick? make them all purple. Can I even find an LGS with 9 packs of Purple Eclipses? Should I just buy them online? What if my package gets lost in the mail again? that's another $90 I put into sleeves that went to waste. I need a break.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Haha thanks :3 yeah I'm surprised that veil of summer an uncommon in M20 is above $5.00 now. I've had the idea of just sleeving decks I'm currently playing. Like the top 5 or whatever and putting the rest away. There's no need to bring 20+ decks to every event I go to, right? Plus. With dragon Shields I noticed that take some time to wear in, like a new pair of shoes. But once they do, they are amazing. I'd prefer Dragon Shield with 60-75 card decks. But that's just too think for commander for me. I find Eclipses to be a much more pleasant experience.</TEXT>

    <TITLE>Big Mama Bear (good ending)</TITLE>
    <DATE>2020-10-16 09:15:27</DATE>
    <TEXT>I was working register at a gas station. A mother had sent her kid in with 5 dollars to get a bottle of soda. He buys the soda, I give him his change. No big deal. Kids come in to buy their own stuff all the time. I actually find it really charming when kids are independent like that. Anyway. A few minutes later he comes back in. He walks around the store. Gets to my register with bottle in hand. And he says something. I'm not sure what. I think he's trying to get another bottle of soda. So I ring him out again. Give him his change. And he's on his way. But he takes the bottle. And puts it back in the fridge. Then it hits me. He was trying to return the original bottle he got. I just sold the kid 2 bottles of soda and he's walking out empty handed. I know I'm in trouble now. Sure enough. About two minutes later. In walks Mama Bear. I see her. Immediately know why she's coming in and why she's mad. And I have to act quick to tell her I'm sorry. I didn't understand the situation. I can fix it. I refund the two bottles of soda and give her her change back. And all was right with the world. But that moment of "Aw crap, here it comes" will always stick with me. Haha.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I haven't been to my LGS in months but from my experience. Irl, meta decks beat my casual decks but mostly because I didn't play them right. But on Arena, I've been kicking butt with my casual azorious flying tribal. It's pretty casual, cheap to build too. Those are my favorite decks. Cheap that work.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I wish arin would play it in his free time though. I feel like he'd really get into the lore and stuff. Honestly though I can't blame them. The game is huge and easy to get lost on your first playthrough.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I think game grumps shined when they played and laughed at games that were quick to play, terrible, and glitchy. I don't think award winning thought prevoking games is GGs forte. I come to laugh. Not a walkthrough.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I never wanted to buy a Youtooz before, but this might be the start. I like the idea of having both Mark and Ethen in their Unus Annus suits.</TEXT>

    <TITLE>Opinions on Lumity and the show moving forward.</TITLE>
    <DATE>2020-10-18 07:23:01</DATE>
    <TEXT>I just wanted to say that I'm really glad that this show isn't treating Lumity as a gay crush. It's just a crush. Going forward I want them to keep this mentality. I'm tired of the coming out scene, the inner monologues of denial. Stuff like that. It's been done to death in media and we need to move away from it. If it's going to be normalized in western media then treat it like any other relationship. Which they have been.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I've been playing drums for 10 years now and I had never got a cramp in my forearm like I did tonight. There could have been many reasons why it happened but I just want to ask if there's ways to prevent future cramps or help dealing with them when they happen.</TEXT>

    <TITLE>So many decks! Deck boxes?</TITLE>
    <DATE>2020-10-19 10:39:25</DATE>
    <TEXT>I was just curious how y'all manage your decks. Right now I have them in 3 long boxes and a couple of Ultimate Guarded boulders. But I would really like them to be in individual boxes. I'm worried about price though. Even the cheap ones will add up with all the decks I have. How do y'all keep your decks?</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Weird thing about satin towers. I hate the sound of dice rattling in those boxes. Idk why but it just makes me cringe. Their expensive but I absolutely LOVE the Sidewinder. I can fit a commander deck Or a modern deck with some dice and it fits perfectly.</TEXT>
