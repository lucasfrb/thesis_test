    <TEXT>Glad you enjoyed the video lol. But seriously, I'm glad you were able to agree with the video. I had a similar video submitted on this subreddit (called "KILLING JUNK") in case you're interested. BTW, I added the "Superhero" part in the title because I feel the need to express that not all comics are about superheroes. You may see this as a nitpick, but...hey.  #175;\_( #12484;)_/ #175;</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Neil's response to Nick Balton's comment: *(Hey this is Neil, I run this account now) Interesting perspective-- I wonder if I'd really thought it through if I wouldn't have kept the whistle. I mostly threw it in because the Zimmer song ran a couple extra measures after the YMCA vocals ended, and I thought it helped it sort of return to the memeverse gently. There's not a lot of intentional cynicism in my mashup choices (except maybe Wonderwall.) "Like Tears In Chocolate Rain" has a bit of a similar nature to it, I'm curious if you think that sticks the landing better?*</TEXT>

    <TEXT>To anyone new to the thread wondering what the comment was: *YMCA has always been about being a gay homeless (likely non-white) youth, but had an aggressively positive town to obfuscate the pain, done both to offer a reassuring voice for those in that situation and to sneak it past scrutiny. YMCA is the greatest prank played on straight people: A song about finding safety  amp; community despite the rest of the world shunning you for being gay is now a staple of cheesy white people dancing.* *This is Neil Cicierega highlighting that subtext with accompaniment that complemented it, rather than contrasted like the original song. Basically, he explained with music (and MOOD) what I just explained in the above paragraph. He used his MO of dada shitposts to expose a bunch of jokesters to a song about the plight of gay youth.* *So what REALLY fucks me up is that he undermines all of this by putting the All Star whistle at the end to turn it all into a goof. It feels like the song laughing at the listener for getting emotional in the first place. It really leaves a bad taste in my mouth #65279;.*</TEXT>

Dreamworks also, according to the recruiter, hasn't changed their main character designer team since THE BEGINNING.* *I've also met people who worked at Dreamworks and they always were very 'meh' about the experience while Disney and Pixar ex animators and art directors talked about their experiences as live changing. #65279;"*</TEXT>

He creates well thought-out plans for film projects and understands what could and work and what definitely doesn't. His pitch for the Call of Duty cinematic universe is brilliant and his ideas for the Akira remake are ON POINT (the only thing I would add is that the actors should be a mix of different races). I have to say those two are right up their with his "Escape from America" idea. I can't wait to see more of these from him and other people on YouTube. :D</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Although I couldn't agree more, I feel it's important to remember that both filmmakers and critics can be emotionally swayed. For example, a filmmaker would be less likely to give a film a bad review than a film critic. But I think it still comes down to the opinion of someone you respect that is important, whether you respect them for the films they have made or for their review of films they have seen. #65279;</TEXT>

    <TEXT>**The fact that you said this proves you didn't pay attention to what she was actually saying. :/** The main point Lindsey repeatedly states that cultural appropriation is not an inherently bad thing. So even if Disney is responsible for cultural appropriation it doesn't necessarily mean that they're a bad company and that in some instances (Like Lilo and Stitch) it even enhances the story that they're trying to tell. In the video she specifically states that the "people responsible for colonialism shouldn't appropriate culture from the oppressed" is more of a rule of thumb than a rule you should religiously follow. To me it's clear that she was simplifying for the sake of time constraints. She's never been the type of person to make "you can't do x" statements, she usually is more along the lines of "maybe you should consider what it means to do x". In my opinion, this is kind of OK if a rule to follow if you have literally no idea of what cultural appropriation even is, but personally I think the video would've been better if this line was changed to actually explain how nuanced the issue can be instead of just alluding to its complexity. I also agree that she could have described its negative impacts in more detail. And for the second point I think her point is that as long as Disney remains a company that prioritizes making a product that is commercially viable over one that is accurate in its portrayal of other cultures they will not be able to make their films as accurate as they could be. **And the reason that she brought up the white members of the management was to explain that even if they bring in experts on culture, the management that ends up calling the shots don't even need to listen to their advice and prioritize completely different things.** They have no real reason to really care at all past a certain point. She never says that they shouldn't portray other cultures at any point in the video.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>If **you** think what she is talking about is just to make whites feel a sense of guilt, maybe it's not Lindsay that is the problem. :( **She says that "the rule of thumb" is that if the culture or group of people have been historically exploited by colonialism appropriating a historically colonizing culture, no harm no foul. I mean, when was the last time you saw Chinese people criticizing black people for doing kung fu or movies about kung fu?** **But, if the situation is vice-versa, that's when people get cranky, due to the fact that it can veer into making a caricature of the appropriated culture: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bL4nHYFZoGs**</TEXT>

    <TEXT> gt;Putting ethnic people into traditionally white roles isn't going to reverse slavery, or the native genocides, or Jim Crow, or black face. And worse, In my opinion it simply comes off as condescending. As if giving ethnic people white characters to play somehow will make up for the harm our ancestors did to their ancestors. That's weird and nearly laughable if it weren't for the fact that some people think that this is actual progress of some sort. It's not. Not at all. It's not even in the same ballpark. I know this won't solve systematic racism, I'm not stupid. The point I'm trying to make is that thanks to many characters in fiction that were created by white people who only talked to other white people and the "powers that be", a lot of society sees a white guy as the default main character (just like how Japan sees the Japanese guy as the default main character in media). It may not seem like it, but this can have a negative effect on marginalized people (like I mentioned; "the black doll white doll test"  gt;White people total over 70% of the population (over 60% if you count only non-Hispanics). Black people 12%. Asians, not quite 5%. Everyone else, less than 1%. Every single nation on this earth who has any sort of film industry at all has the majority ethnicity primarily represented in front of the cameras. Hong Kong, Japan, S. Korea all have almost entirely Asian casts. Bollywood, almost entirely ethnic Indian. Iran, Persians. Nigeria, native African. America may in fact have the most diverse mix of ethnicities that share the spotlight. Studies have found that those represented in Hollywood pretty much match their population percentages to a T. So, all those sci-fi, fantasy  amp; animated films that get released every year are filled with white people are because they want to match REALITY? Last time I checked, there's no real reason why Luke Skywalker needed to be white other than Mark Hamill being a talented actor.  gt;I don't think you intended it, but this comes off heavily demeaning. Almost as if you're saying, "black people will watch dumb shit because it has black people in it". I'd like to think that most black audiences are a bit more sophisticated than that, and that the reason why they enjoy Tyler Perry films is because they find it sincerely funny, and are relatable in ways not tied simply to the shared color of their skin. I guess I should come out and say that I happen to be African-American. I come from a family that hates these films and everyone I talked to hates them as well. But you're right, I can't speak for everyone in my community and there are some people who DO enjoy those films. But I greatly feel those films set us back in terms of progress. I also doubt all those actors want to be performing in those types of films.  gt;You want more people of color in film? I'd be happy to see that too. But let's not let the politics of our era override story. This is something I greatly disagree with. Politics has always been a part of our lives, whether we notice it or not. From the Hollywood Blacklist to seperated the art from the artist, we've always drenched in politics. Heck, politics itself means **activities aimed at improving someone's status or increasing power within an organization**. I don't know about you, but that sounds a lot like Hollywood. As you can see this is something I feel very strongly about. I just wish that Hollywood would live up to its words (you know how they love to brag about how **diverse** they are) since at its core, doing so would be effortless. That's pretty much all I have to say.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>This is such a STRANGE idea to go with. Don't get me wrong, this show tried to help American children learn a different tongue and have a good female lead (the reason she's human and not an animal as planned is because a Nickelodeon executive said that there were no positive Latino role models on TV for kids). But, the only reason **_Dora the Explorer_** has stayed in the public  amp; pop-culture conscience is because of the constant reruns the show had on Nick Jr. and the fact that the network once upon a time treated it as their biggest cash cow, outside of **_SpongeBob SquarePants_** *[(if you think I'm bluffing, check out this comic made by the Johnnywander.com team during their tour of Nick Magazine HQ during its last days)] (https://imgprx.livejournal.net/7577e6077ff4ae17e9669ea90c37268790920d63/7NgwLH8PyYYVbqJ2qo7i3D_zbVPAcdTqjlPwgGjJD8UMhKwKVro4-R375MJN8r8VrUZjNIY9nIVhES_iJVVKTAvTQsPcOhMRHYyA_2K76nmsrnBjHzlAfofzOPXWSal6)*: https://nickmag-comics.livejournal.com/29985.html My biggest question however is if this DOES get made, _will they keep the Mexican/Latino culture to a minimum_? I say this because even though the show was designed to teach kids the Spanish language, every foreign dub of the show teaches kids how to speak English (which to be honest, makes a lot of sense).</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I see where your coming from. But let me put it this way: _Since when has any white person been burdened due to Homer Simpson?_ You may say he's a parody, but that stems from more the sitcom archetype that his own race (he's also not the only white person on the show :/). People of Indian descent don't have that luxury, and that's because, aside from his family (who doesn't appear that much anyway), Apu is the only Indian person on the show. When you're in a situation like that, it can indirectly end up being a mockery of said race for some people. If you want to know what I'm talking about, you should watch the _Master of None_ episode, "Indians on TV".</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Dude, people ruin words with their bigotry. (Example:www.youtube.com/watch?v=maDogJyQg6Q) Seriously this. It's not "political correctness" making it bad for the kid, it's the very obvious fact that black people are referred to as monkeys regularly by bigots that is the problem to begin with. The "political correctness" around it wouldn't exist if it wasn't for racists actually calling black people monkeys. People on this site are pretending that the whole racist connotation is just a thing in America are so wrong. There are lots of cases of fans throwing bananas at black soccer players.</TEXT>

From Japan, **Masaaki Yuasa's** [**Lu Over The Wall**](http://www.animationforadults.com/2017/12/lu-over-wall-2017.html) will be this year's opening film. There will also be a chance to see Chinese animated feature **Big Fish  amp; Begonia** well in advance of April's cinema release. There will be a number of French-produced (and co-produced) features including **The Big Bad Fox  amp; Other Tales, White Fang,** and **Zombillenium**. From Denmark comes the East Coast Premiere of **Next Door Spy**. There will also be a rare screening of early **Isao Takahata** feature, 1968's **Horus, Prince Of The Sun** (aka **The Little Norse Prince**). Beyond the features, there will be an impressive line-up of shorts, including the New York Premiere of the **Annie Award** and **BAFTA-**[winning](http://www.animationforadults.com/2018/02/coco-and-poles-apart-bring-home-baftas.html) **Poles Apart**. The shorts will screen as part of several programs, alongside live-action shorts. There are also VR experiences including **Jorge Gutierrez's Son of Jaguar** and **Wolves In The Walls** (based on a book by **Neil Gaiman**).</TEXT>

    <TEXT>_"In 1998, the Cartoon Network introduced the world to the Powerpuff Girls: three little girls named Blossom, Buttercup and Bubbles who used their superpowers to save the world before bedtime. Craig McCracken is the animator who brought the Powerpuff Girls to life. To celebrate their 20th anniversary, McCracken presents a q oral history, taking us back to the doodle that started it all.

    <TEXT>Personal thoughts: I assumed the film would be just fine in advance, but this looks _pretty good_. I mean, _of course_ the only reason **Teen Titans Go!** would get a theatrical movie is to parody the genre. Though, I still question what this film will do that **Deadpool, Lego Batman**,  amp; soon **Deadpool 2** haven't already done. On another note, even if it's not in the official DC Cinematic Universe, it's nice to see people at DC Comics have fun with the other characters they own **that aren't Superman or Batman.** (the later I feel has become over-saturated for cinematic media) If this film _does_ end up get poorly received by film critics, I'll be genuinely surprised.</TEXT>

It doesn't have a multimedia platform like _Sonic the Headgehog_ or numerous incarnations like _TMNT_ or _Transformers_. Like those shows, it was mainly made to sell toys, and it didn't gain the popularity of those two, so Warner Bros. chose to wisely do fuck all with it.</TEXT>

Manuel Cristobal, producer of another recently successful Spanish animated feature, Wrinkles, is also on board. The film is based on the making of Bu #241;uel 1932 documentary short Land Without Bread, and the censorship of the film that followed. The feature has been pre-bought by the Spanish public broadcaster RTVE: _1930, Paris, The Golden Age of film is a scandal and Luis Bu #241;uel who thought he was destined for stardom of surrealism is left with nothing. He is offered a documentary on one of the poorest areas in Spain, Las Hurdes, but he has no money. His friend, the sculptor Ram #243;n Ac #237;n buys a lottery ticket with the promise that he will pay for the film, he wins and keeps his promise. The harshness of Las Hurdes and the extreme misery of its people affect Bu #241;uel deeply. Reality, memories of his childhood, Salvador Dal #237; and dreams are mixed in his mind, endangering the film and his friendship with Ram #243;n. From there will come the Bu #241;uel of the future. But what is left on the way? How much that step costs?_</TEXT>

One of the most popular critiques is that every current animated show has the "CalArts style" named after the school for animation and its alumni making said shows, even though one could quickly research and debunk the fact that ALL these people went there.

I guess I should mention that this new show ha the potential to bring new fans to the franchise. For example: Since you mentioned _Star Trek_, do you really think the IP gotten heightened interest, brand new fans, and a new show, and all of that _wasn't_ the direct result of J.J. Abhram's well-recieved, but kinda-mediocre film reboot?

    <TEXT>From the USA: This seems to be the case for a number of countries. For exmaple, Italy got [a load of anime](https://www.quora.com/Is-it-true-that-Japanese-animated-series-are-very-popular-in-Italy) during the late 20th century, mostly [uncensored](https://www.awn.com/mag/issue1.5/articles/goslingeuro1.5.html). Meanwhile, in France, they were able to get anime, American cartoons, and European cartoons during the late 70s to the late 90s. There were so many, some one had to make [a whole site documenting them!](http://www.planete-jeunesse.com/) Also, I believe I've heard that opening! :D For anyone who's curious: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4gCfysUhQic</TEXT>

    <TEXT>YouTube Description: _This is a video depicting a compilation of scenes of a fascinating villain from my memories, fallen Spirit Detective and multiple-personality stricken instigator of the apocalypse Shinobu Sensui (voiced by Robert McCollum) from the hit anime Yu Yu Hakusho. I found him to be a exceptionally interesting villain because of his presentation as a perfect example of what happens when a hero has his morals and his personality wound too tight and faces something that utterly shatters his principles. His story was heartbreaking to me because he was truly a heroic young man who just couldn't handle how messed up mankind could be. I hope you enjoy him as much as I did._ If you are curious, EmptyMan000 has done plenty of similar videos for villain characters from other anime and animated series. :)</TEXT>

They are extremely well done. **Description:** _Brad Bird, writer and director of animated films 'The Iron Giant', 'The Incredibles' and 'Ratatouille', gives an insight into his writing process, how he directs animation and why many people fundamentally misunderstand the medium. Subtitles available._ _Find out which animated film that one clip was from by turning on the 'English CC' subtitle track._ _This video combines excerpts from the three audio commentary tracks on home releases of 'The Iron Giant', 'The Incredibles' and 'Ratatouille', as well as fragments from the behind-the-scenes documentaries. Watching the films prior to watching this video is recommended, but not entirely necessary._</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Brad Bird has never directed a kids film. He's directed adult films that appeal to kids. Now, by adult I don't mean "swearing, nudity and gore", I mean having a mature point of view, dealing with life's hard truths in a thoughtful way without condescension or watering down (Example: https://vimeo.com/189791698). Sure, it's sweetened with cool action scenes and funny gags, but it doesn't sanitize or dumb things down for the sake of a younger audience.</TEXT>

In this new installment of the "Movies with Mikey" series, Mikey Neumann goes and talks about animation he saw as a kid and as an adult and what he learned from them. Towards the end, he called on other YouTube content creators to make similar videos titled *Lessons Animation Taught Us*. I've seen a number of them, all of them with differing styles and lessons people learned. The playlist is still growing as I type. I'd thought I post the playlist here as a signal boost to for anyone interested in doing a video. :)</TEXT>

It is amazing how the former is the only feature animation studio that has not been engulfed by the pop-culture-centric, lull destruction, bathos-ridden landscape that so many others have fallen victim to (I personally blame the Genie from _Aladdin_ and to a much higher degree, _Shrek_). Catsuka is a website I usually visit when I want to see the stype of stuff that you are talking about. The website is in French but they have a small summary at the end of each article in English. www.catsuka.com Let me know if you want more animation sites, I have a whole list! :D</TEXT>

I remember her saying in a live-stream she does it like that because she saw what happened to Anita Sarkeesian when she was direct in her points, and decided that if it is done in this non-caring attitude, people will be more accepting towards it. This film was just a chore for her to get through, and a great notice of Disney's new business model.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>[Full Thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/anime/comments/9qtpic/anime_has_a_s3xual_harassment_problem/?limit=500) [Original video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i0G1jvz0khQ amp;feature=youtu.be) Context: An Anime YouTuber by the name of The Pedantic Romantic makes video on sexual harassment in anime, using some recent examples. She also goes into the culture of Japan when it comes to sexual harassment/assault, including a quote from an advisor for the current prime minster: _"The deepest suffering belongs to the men who are plagued with the symptoms of train groper syndrome, in which his hand automatically moves the he steps on a packed train and catches a whiff of a woman. Repeated offenses show that it is an uncontrollable urge stemming from the brain. Shouldn't society protect and reserve their rights to grope [women]? If you want to talk about shock, well, the sight of the honorable LGBT walking the streets in mainstream media is shocking to me. Shocking to the point of being a deadly threat to me. I must ask of them to speak only after they have paid me an insurmountable amount for damages."_ Suffice to say, the thread was already locked when I first came across it, along with a bunch of removed comments.

    <TEXT>If you want to know more about _Age of Sail_, [the Online Animation Magazine Skwigly did an interview with the director](http://www.skwigly.co.uk/podcast-john-kahrs/). Pretty interesting stuff. _Bao_ and _Bilby_ are nice, but I do agree that they are lacking in some parts. However, I'm 100% confident they will be nominated due to they being "cute" and pretty much crowd-pleasers. Man, I'm noticing across the board there isn't a lot of love for _Grandpa Walrus_. I thought it was geneuinely unique and honest in its depiction of family loss. I even liked the art style that they went with.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I thought the same thing that you did after watching them, but after re-watching a few and thinking for a bit, I noticed that each of those 5 shorts had a specific way of telling its story. **_Grandpa Walrus_** was clearly going for a more surreal route with a raw tone. Grounded in a gray, gloomy world, we have a family that clearly shows they aren't always on good terms, but will be there for each other, what with the entire family coming in to hug Lucas in one, tear-filled gathering. **_Late Afternoon_** is more interested in the displaying the faded memories of an old woman who, whether it be from old age or some illness, has trouble a lot of things. In the process of what appears to be moving into a elderly care (with the help of a supposed caretaker), she finds many belongings she hasn't seen in years that help her remember certain key people (husband, mother, etc.), with the final one being a person she treasures, who was in front of her all along. **_Weekends_** is particularly unique for making the entire short silent. By not explaining what's going on, the short is able to show the wonderment and helplessness a child feels in their young life, usually just by observing and having their memories of different events be detailed by specific objects (in this case, a sculpture of a red horse). One scene in particular stood out to me exemplifying this, where the man drops off his ex-son for the last time, and before going to his mom, the little boy stops and takes one, final look at his birth father. Unfortunately, the last two, **_Bao_**  amp; **_One Step_**, both feel like they are going for the typical, clean-looking, feel-good charm that both Disney and Pixar have capitalized on. Though, even I can see that they were aiming to tell different tales (the former being about staying in touch with the people that raised you and the latter is realizing who has been helping you achieve your life goals all these years).</TEXT>

    <TEXT>That probably has to do with [the rule change](https://www.cartoonbrew.com/awards/oscar-rules-change-impact-indie-foreign-films-best-animated-feature-race-150099.html). A number of Academy voters were complaining that films  amp; shorts they never heard of kept getting nominated (the nominees were picked by the animator  amp; VFX part of the voting party). So, they loosened the restrictions so every member can vote for what will be a nominee, which explains why **_The Boss Baby_** and **_Ferdinand_** got nominated last year. ....Yeah, even [major film news outlets saw this as a bad idea](https://www.slashfilm.com/new-animation-oscar-rule/).</TEXT>

    <TEXT>_Age of Sail_: I think calling the ending "cheesy" is a tad harsh. Yeah, it got a happy ending, but outside of _Lost  amp; Found_ and _Bird Karma_, you could say the say thing about every short on this shortlist. Plus, he wasn't out to drown himself; he accidentally slipped in the water and was okay with the girl sailing off without him. Even though he was going to die in that moment, he was happy that he at least got to talk to someone who took the time to appreciate the art of sailing. _Grandpa Walrus_: They were crying because their grandfather is dead...I think that explains that. _Bilby_: Also, just to be clear, that was a baby stork, not goose (they even show it grown up at the end!). The short was clearly taking place in Australia. That's all I have to say, the rest of your gripes are clearly a matter of taste and that's fine.</TEXT>

    <TITLE>Oscar Shortlist For Animated Shorts Snubbed Most Of 2018 #8217;s Best Shorts</TITLE>
    <DATE>2019-01-06 18:09:24</DATE>
    <TEXT>https://www.cartoonbrew.com/awards/oscar-shortlist-for-animated-shorts-snubbed-most-of-2018s-best-shorts-167961.html I was surprised that my shortlist post got so popular here, so I thought I'd share this article from Cartoon Brew. A lot of people were saying that the shorts felt quite similar, and I believe this has something to do with that feeling. For those that can't access the link, I've pasted the whole article below: **The Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences has announced the 10-film shortlist of animated shorts that will advance in the voting process for the 91st Academy Awards.** The 10 films are listed below in alphabetical order by title: _Age of Sail_  #8212; John Kahrs (USA) _Animal Behaviour_  #8212; Alison Snowden, David Fine (Canada) _Bao_  #8212; Domee Shi (USA) _Bilby_  #8212; Pierre Perifel, J.P. Sans, Liron Topaz (USA) _Bird Karma_  #8212; William Salazar (USA) _Grandpa Walrus_ (P #233;p #233; le Morse)  #8212; Lucr #232;ce Andreae (France) _Late Afternoon_  #8212; Louise Bagnall (Ireland) _Lost  amp; Found_  #8212; Andrew Goldsmith, Bradley Slabe (Australia) _One Small Step_  #8212; Andrew Chesworth, Bobby Pontillas (USA/China) _Weekends_  #8212; Trevor Jimenez (USA) Members of the Short Films and Feature Animation Branch will now vote to determine the shortlist and the nominees. The nominations will be announced on Tuesday, January 22, 2019. The list offers plenty of films that are entertaining and cute, but it #8217;s a weak reflection of the state of contemporary animation short-form filmmaking. Cartoon Brew recently [polled ten industry-recognized short film experts](https://www.cartoonbrew.com/awards/animation-experts-pick-the-best-animated-shorts-competing-for-this-years-academy-award-165405.html) (film programmers, critics, journalists, festival artistic directors) about the best films among the [Academy #8217;s group of qualified shorts](https://www.cartoonbrew.com/awards/2019-best-animated-short-film-oscar-a-list-of-qualified-films-in-the-category-exclusive-164563.html), and there #8217;s a wide gulf between what the short film community views as meritable animation and what Academy voters selected for this shortlist. None of the top three films selected by our group of experts  #8212; La chute by Boris Labb #233;, Solar Walk by R #233;ka Bucsi, Bloeistraat 11 by Nienke Deutz  #8212; appear on the Academy #8217;s shortlist. Among the top six films selected by our experts, just one  #8212; Weekends by Trevor Jimenez  #8212; made the cut. Another fascinating stat: six of the ten films on the Academy #8217;s shortlist were not selected even once by any of our 10 experts. Of those six films, five of them  #8212; Age of Sail, Bao, Bird Karma, Bilby, One Small Step  #8212; were made by California corporations or crews that have strong California industry connections. One cannot discount the role that being a member of the California animation industry plays during the Academy Awards voting process. And for anyone who wants to claim that our panel of experts is wrong, here #8217;s another stat: Of the four films that were made by California corporations  #8212; Age of Sail, Bao, Bilby, Bird Karma  #8212; none of them won an award at a qualifying Academy festival, which is the traditional route by which a film is considered for the category. All four of those films qualified through public paid exhibition in L.A. county, bypassing the need for any critical recognition from the global animation community. The other shortlisted films in the category all qualified by winning festival awards. On the plus side, there are no shortlisted filmmakers in this year #8217;s animation category who have been arrested and charged with rape, so regardless of what anyone thinks of the shortlist, at least the animation category won #8217;t be a [complete fiasco like the 2018 Oscars](https://www.cartoonbrew.com/awards/13000-signed-petition-take-away-kobe-bryants-oscar-nomination-dear-basketball-156230.html).</TEXT>

    <TITLE>Anime Has A S3xual Harassment Problem (Video by The Pedantic Romantic) - Discussion</TITLE>
    <DATE>2019-01-07 21:58:03</DATE>
    <TEXT>2 months ago, an anime YouTuber by the name of ThePedanticRomantic made a video detailing the problem of sexual harassment in anime and its effect on the Japanese community: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i0G1jvz0khQ She also goes into the culture of Japan when it comes to sexual harassment/assault She also shows how this has great effect on the Japanese population, including a quote from an advisor for the current prime minster: _"The deepest suffering belongs to the men who are plagued with the symptoms of train groper syndrome, in which his hand automatically moves the he steps on a packed train and catches a whiff of a woman. Repeated offenses show that it is an uncontrollable urge stemming from the brain. Shouldn't society protect and reserve their rights to grope [women]? If you want to talk about shock, well, the sight of the honorable LGBT walking the streets in mainstream media is shocking to me. Shocking to the point of being a deadly threat to me. I must ask of them to speak only after they have paid me an insurmountable amount for damages."_ This video was posted in r/anime, and the community was torn, to say the least, so much so that [the thread is now locked](https://www.reddit.com/r/anime/comments/9qtpic/anime_has_a_s3xual_harassment_problem/). She also [posted a followup video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aHiJbVFpQaY), replying to comments she recieved criticizing the video. I just realized that these two videos were never talked about here, and I thought we could have a discussion on this said topic.</TEXT>

    <DATE>2019-01-11 16:16:03</DATE>
    <TEXT>That's right. [[the deep end]](https://twitter.com/adultswimpod) is a new fan podcast that aims to review every show that Adult Swim has ever produced and/or aired, starting with its first year. The podcast is hosted by [Matthew Jay](https://twitter.com/MrMattJay) of [Cartoons 101](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCWNai_R-Gf1NXhoMIswPbBA) and [Steve Yurko](http://www.steveyurko.com/), a storyboard artist and host of [the One Piece Podcast](http://www.onepiecepodcast.com/). They mainly wanted to start this since Adult Swim was a huge part of their lives growing up. They have 4 episodes out now as of typing this, covering the first seasons of _Aqua Teen Hunger Force_, _Home Movies_, _The Brak Show_, and _Harvey Birdman: Attorney at Law_. If you subscribe to [their Patreon](https://www.patreon.com/thedeepend), they have a seperate podcast that plans to go through every episode of _The Venture Bros_. As someone who didn't grow up with Adult Swim (born in 1996), this is a very unique podcast that I think you all might like: Here's where you can listen to it: [iTunes](https://itunes.apple.com/us/podcast/the-deep-end/id1445635911) [Libsyn.com](http://adultswimpod.libsyn.com/) [Listen Notes](https://www.listennotes.com/podcasts/the-deep-end-matthew-jay-and-steve-yurko-zsaEh0JZ3Ri/) [Player.FM](https://player.fm/series/the-deep-end-2469999) [Podbay](http://podbay.fm/show/1445635911) [Podbean](https://www.podbean.com/podcast-detail/78crv-7e1f6/%5Bthe-deep-end%5D-Podcast) [pod|fanatic](https://podfanatic.com/podcast/the-deep-end)</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Ignoring the fact that there is a lot of quote-on-quote "shock comedy" on social media sites like this one, it just really feels calculated to the point where the offence I take from certain jokes is just exhaustion. It's also becoming more and more clear to me the past couple of years that "PC culture has gone out of control" is the last resort for a comedian that's past his prime and still has a platform to speak on. From this to Ricky Gervais's Netflix special where he wants to make it clear that HE DOESN'T CARE about the people on Twitter that don't like his jokes. I've also seen a number of people trying to use this stance to their advantage. Louis C.K. recently seems like he's trying to make his audience he got kicked out comedy for being too "edgy", and not the fact that he was a creepy sex pervert.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>You're not wrong, but it appears as if comedians want a 100% positive reception. Cosindering the fact that they have had these careers for so long, they should know that not everyone is going to like their jokes firsthand. Everyone references the fact that Jerry Seinfield doesn't want perform on campuses anymore because they're too PC. I decided to look up what he said that caused a stir, [and he just wanted to tell a bunch of "gay French king" jokes](https://www.esquire.com/entertainment/tv/news/a35610/jerry-seinfeld-politically-correct-gay-king-joke/). He wasn't booed or taken off stage, the audience was bored. And that was apparently enough to make him think that PC culture is out of control. You and I know that stuff like that is lame material now. It just shows me how out of tune he really is with the current culture, and how rich he is that he hasn't interacted with anyone outside of his social circle. Outside of that comedians in cars show and "Bee Movie", what has Jerry done recently that was of any real significance?</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Stickied comment: Just some answers to a few questions I thought you might have. **1) Are you saying that Mario games should be condemned in the same way we condemn nazi propaganda?** No. **2) Are you implying that people are bad when they consume and authentically enjoy politically problematic media?** No. **3)These YouTubers aren #8217;t saying all things produced under capitalism are good, they #8217;re saying that the market for video games is mostly men so it #8217;s fine that games are the way they are. That #8217;s a different argument, right?** No it #8217;s not. That #8217;s the same argument. Everything sold under capitalism is sold to the people who buy it. That an audience buys a thing (or that a thing is sold to the people who buy it) does not mean that thing is harmless. **4)You seem to be stepping into some Jack Thompson territory here. Are you implying that any game that romanticizes violence ought to condemned or some such nonsense?** Well, no. While I do think it absolutely is fair to criticize the violence in certain games and to criticize the medium as a whole for its over-reliance on the treatment of violence as cool, good, or just, we have to acknowledge that violence is the mechanical lingua franca of games in general. As I advise in my video, we must always consider the way the violence depicted in a game interacts with a broader culture. For instance, a game wherein torturous violence is committed against, say, an arrested terrorist paints a very different picture from a game where violence is committed against a genuinely evil figure or a cartoon character. We have to be specific and attentive to these things.* **5) You say you don #8217;t like cultivation theory but never challenge Sargon or Thunderf00t #8217;s obviously silly idea that for cultivation theory to be true, murder rates or whatever must literally increase. You #8217;re aware this is silly right?** Yes I am aware. The burden of proof these guys demand from cultivation theory is absurd, and they fail to recognize that 1) Games might have more covert negative effects on the people who play them than literally making them murder or 2) Games could just be causing violent crime to go up even as murder rates fall. That said, this was just an unnecessary thing to talk about haha. **6) (the one i referred to in the video) You say in your video that the association between violence and sexuality is a problematic thing that Anita sees in culture. I #8217;ll have you know that plenty of good people, women included, are aroused by images of violence against women. What #8217;s your response?** I fully recognize that there are all sorts of things that would be bad were they to occur in real life, or non-consensually, that are perfectly fine to fantasize about alone or with a partner. But this fact does not excuse all media from criticism. BDSM media can convey bad messages or good messages or fine messages in the same way all media can. And that violence occurs in a piece of art is not, on the face of it, enough to condemn it. Again, we must look at the interaction between a work and the broader social structure before we can fully understand its subtext and meaning. For instance, does Double Dragon encourage us to look at women as objects or subjects in their sexuality? Does it pose violence against the female character as a fun prop or as a significant event? Is the violence against her meaningfully contextualized as erotic fantasy? Again, I haven #8217;t played the game and these are obviously very complicated questions, questions that are contingent on the precise functioning (or lack of functioning, as these YouTubers might have it) of the patriarchy within modern culture. **7) You said that claims about the harmfulness of art are not referring to the literal impact art has on society and then say the only way we can ascertain the messages of art is through that society. Isn't that a contradiction?** No. To be honest I have no clue why I'm including this question. I just suspect one person might comment it and it'll puzzle me then as it puzzles me now. Those are two different things haha #65279;</TEXT>

    <TEXT>This is a mirror of Big Joel's video. The original got false-flagged for "hate speech" and was taken down. What resulted in this happening was a Sargon of Akkad response video. You can see Big Joel comment on it in this Twitter thread [here](https://twitter.com/biggestjoel/status/1099453201093414913).</TEXT>

So, I'm sharing it. For those wondering, the art was done by Toby Morris of The Spinoff. If you're a non-New Zealander like me, the man does some pretty good stuff on what's going on there. His work includes topics like Waitangi, inequality in NZ, housing and a range of other issues. [Check here for more](https://thespinoff.co.nz/author/toby-morris/).</TEXT>

    <TITLE>/r/unpopularopinion threads explain how Jordan Peele is a "dumb racist piece of shit" and how his movies are "racist" after acclaimed directors' recent comments on casting</TITLE>
    <DATE>2019-03-28 23:20:16</DATE>
    <TEXT>So a recent [Hollywood Reporter article](https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/rambling-reporter/jordan-peele-says-i-dont-see-myself-casting-a-white-dude-as-lead-us-1197021) talked about Jordan Peele and recent interview he did. Here's the 4-sentence quote: _"I don #8217;t see myself casting a white dude as the lead in my movie. Not that I don #8217;t like white dudes," he said, nodding over to his moderator pal Roberts. "But I've seen that movie." The line drew loud applause and shouts of agreement. "It really is one of the best, greatest pieces of this story, is feeling like we are in this time  #8212; a renaissance has happened and proved the myths about representation in the industry are false."_ If you read the whole article, it's actually a pretty interesting conversation that is clearly not controversial in the slightest. But, Probably because some people on this site only read the title, users were quick to give their hot takes on the man known as Jordan Peele and his work. **1st Thread:** [Jordan "DUMB RACIST PIECE OF SHIT" Peele](https://www.reddit.com/r/unpopularopinion/comments/b65e7n/jordan_peele_is_a_dumb_racist_piece_of_shit/) [The only "if a white guy had done it" comment I'll include here because there are TOO MANY](https://www.reddit.com/r/unpopularopinion/comments/b65e7n/jordan_peele_is_a_dumb_racist_piece_of_shit/eji3bbi/) ["Blame the liberals for supporting that sucker!"](https://www.reddit.com/r/unpopularopinion/comments/b65e7n/jordan_peele_is_a_dumb_racist_piece_of_shit/ejjywzo/) [Not married to black woman=Doesn't care about black people](https://www.reddit.com/r/unpopularopinion/comments/b65e7n/jordan_peele_is_a_dumb_racist_piece_of_shit/ejlq05q/) [Commenter brings up Morgan Freeman line for some reason](https://www.reddit.com/r/unpopularopinion/comments/b65e7n/jordan_peele_is_a_dumb_racist_piece_of_shit/ejjee5f/) **2nd thread:** [JORDAN PEELE MAKES RACIST MOVIES](https://www.reddit.com/r/unpopularopinion/comments/b63xj4/jordan_peeles_movies_are_racist/) ["Durr hurr the scary movie with blacks made me scared of blacks"](https://www.reddit.com/r/unpopularopinion/comments/b63xj4/jordan_peeles_movies_are_racist/ejhthn5/) **["It seems that it has now become racist to make social commentaries on real social issues."](https://www.reddit.com/r/unpopularopinion/comments/b63xj4/jordan_peeles_movies_are_racist/ejhs5kd/)** ["'Get Out' was slightly similar to this other movie FRAUD CONFIRMED"](https://www.reddit.com/r/unpopularopinion/comments/b63xj4/jordan_peeles_movies_are_racist/ejhrkbb/) [Nihilism alert](https://www.reddit.com/r/unpopularopinion/comments/b63xj4/jordan_peeles_movies_are_racist/ejhup27/) **3rd thread:** [Black empowerment doesn #8217;t need to equate to white disparagement.](https://www.reddit.com/r/unpopularopinion/comments/b64nur/black_empowerment_doesnt_need_to_equate_to_white/) ["WHY IS EVERYTHING ABOUT RACE WAAAAAAHHH"](https://www.reddit.com/r/unpopularopinion/comments/b64nur/black_empowerment_doesnt_need_to_equate_to_white/ejiaiv8/) [#BoycottRacism](https://www.reddit.com/r/unpopularopinion/comments/b64nur/black_empowerment_doesnt_need_to_equate_to_white/ejipz1u/) [DOUBLE STANDARD](https://www.reddit.com/r/unpopularopinion/comments/b64nur/black_empowerment_doesnt_need_to_equate_to_white/ejia9z9/) I only posted three here.

    <TITLE>Funimation's English Dub changes some of the killer's motivations and fate? Which episodes?</TITLE>
    <DATE>2019-05-01 23:57:18</DATE>
    <TEXT>So, I was looking at the TV Tropes page for Detective Conan, and I read something that I found pretty interesting for the trope **Darker and Edgier**: _The Funimation dub of one episode made the killer's motivation considerably less sympathetic (which made his breakdown and confession considerably more creepy); in the original version, the killer wanted revenge on the man who let his wife die; in the dub, the two men conspired to kill the wife to collect on a life insurance policy and the killer turned on the accomplice to keep him from blabbing._ _The dub of another episode kept the motivation, but changed the killer's fate. In the dub, a desperate woman who had killed a man who'd been threatening her (and was planning to make good on his threats) is sentenced to life in prison; the original version had ended with her being able to rebuild her life._ The description doesn't list which episodes these are. Does anyone know what episodes the description is referring to? Not trying to start any internet fights or anything, but since I've been trying to get back in some old anime/manga again, I thought it would be nice to compare the two scripts.</TEXT>

    <TITLE>The TV Show Miyazaki Directed that People Have Never Heard Of</TITLE>
    <DATE>2019-06-08 19:29:44</DATE>
    <TEXT>So, since the next film director that will be discussed on this podcast will be about Hayao Miyazaki, I figured it would be good to bring attention to the one show he actually directed at the beginning of his career: [Future Boy Conan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Future_Boy_Conan) ( #26410; #26469; #23569; #24180; #12467; #12490; #12531; Mirai Sh #333;nen Konan). Like many anime of the time, it's based on a western children's novel, specifically, [The Incredible Tide](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Incredible_Tide) by [Alexander Key](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alexander_Key). BTW, I said "People" in the title, when I really should be saying "Americans". While the series has never been dubbed in English or licensed on DVD (more info on that [here](https://www.animenewsnetwork.com/answerman/2015-07-14/.90419).), the show was brought over successfully to places like [Italy](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uSGeLtB9e38), [France](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y21o2Q_WYEo), and parts of the [Middle East](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZ5F6C4tnso). Many Gen Xers of those countries can tell you of the found memories they have of watching the show, along with other animated TV series. (Some have even made [tributes](https://500px.com/search/Future%20Boy%20Conan-photos) in the form of [street art](https://twitter.com/gen_ghibli/status/683424457738842113).). While it was never translated into English, **a fansub group fansubbed the whole series, and you can watch on this YouTube playlist [here](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL0A3btqyajzSQSpEd-DBv7PTqUfb1NruX).** **It's a pretty good show, with a great soundtrack to boot.** Extra: [Some background on Isao Takahata's contribution to the show](https://www.animenewsnetwork.com/feature/2018-08-02/isao-takahata-endless-memories/part-i-prehistory/.134998) (Sidenote: If you want my take as to why the show was never picked up by American companies, this show aired close to the beginning of the 1980s, and I believe most execs were ignorant of shows that weren't solely made to sell merchandise, hence why we never got much anime).</TEXT>

    <DATE>2019-08-07 18:43:14</DATE>
    <TEXT>So, yeah we all know the wonderful 1st opening song "Hohoemi no Bakudan ( #24494; #31505; #12415; #12398; #29190; #24382;)" I was looking through some the BGM for the anime, I came across 2 different tracks that were slow interpretations of the theme: [1st Track](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uc1Gn1xKUHQ) [2nd Track](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dch48YWfgfA) It has been common for rappers  amp; etc. to use these tracks as instrumentals: [One which uses the 1st track](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rHVgxlPinQ) [One which uses the 2nd track](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4E853s2dhAU [One which uses the 2nd track](https://soundcloud.com/trey-skies/s-o-a-r-prod-doujinshiexe) I'm mentioning all of this because I want to know if the artist is credited anywhere, and if these tracks from the score were released physically somewhere. I run an account at whosampled.com and I want to document this information. P.S. You've probably guessed by now I haven't seen this show yet. I plan on too! High hopes for it.</TEXT>

    <TITLE>Some neat Lupin III / Castle of Cagliostro facts for Griffin, David and anyone else who's interested. ;)</TITLE>
    <DATE>2019-08-09 23:14:44</DATE>
    <TEXT>So, I was planning on submitting this earlier in the year so Griffin  amp; David could see it, but I kept putting it off. Oh, well. Anyway here are some neat little-known facts about Castle of Caligastro and the _Lupin III_ franchise: - **Castle of Cagliostro**: -  #8226; [January 1981 interview w/ Hayao Miyazaki](https://sites.google.com/site/lupinthethirdcom/anime/films/-1979-the-castle-of-cagliostro/interviews/1981-january-hayao-miyazaki) -  #8226; [June 4, 1981 interview w/ Hayao Miyazaki and Yasuo Ohtsuka](https://sites.google.com/site/lupinthethirdcom/anime/films/-1979-the-castle-of-cagliostro/interviews/1981-4-june-hayao-miyazaki-yasuo-ohtsuka) -  #8226; There are actually 2 full English dubs of this movie: One done by Streamline Pictures  amp; another by Manga Entertainment UK. Both are included on [the Blu-Ray]( https://www.blu-ray.com/movies/Lupin-III-The-Castle-of-Cagliostro-Blu-ray/67383/#Review). - **Lupin III**: -  #8226; Casual anime watchers may think that the franchise is only well-known because of the above movie, but that is far from the truth. With just the anime alone, the franchise is well-known in many parts of the world, especially Italy. They have expressed their love over the years with [music](https://www.whosampled.com/Gli-Amici-Di-Lupin/Lupin,-L%27incorreggibile-Lupin/), [fan films](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5f3KqEkcpC0), [graffiti art]( https://twitter.com/archeoloweeb/status/1118356060283310085) and [Donald Duck comics]( https://twitter.com/FrancescoDonald/status/1118363962549182465) -  #8226; There's a way of holding a cigarette in one's mouth at an angle that Italian slang calls "Jigen-style". -  #8226; As a tribute to Italy for keeping the franchise relevant for all these years, [the fourth series]( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lupin_the_3rd_Part_IV:_The_Italian_Adventure) took place in Italy and was even aired in the country before anywhere else. -  #8226; In the Philippines, it was such a mainstream crossover hit with normally non-anime-watching demographics that it was even remade as a short-lived licensed live-action prime time series. It's one of the only places to see a release of the Japanese live-action movie [_Strange Psychokinetic Strategy_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lupin_III:_Strange_Psychokinetic_Strategy). -  #8226; There was a [planned American spin-off ]( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lupin_the_Third#Lupin_VIII) for the franchise that would be gadget-based and co-produced by DiC Entertainment. This would be the basis for what would become the cartoon _Inspector Gadget_. -  #8226; [A CGI film based on the franchise is coming out in Japanese theaters this December and it looks AMAZING](https://twitter.com/gamespot/status/1149176618239184896).</TEXT>

    <TITLE>Some cool facts about "Nausica #228; of the Valley of the Wind".</TITLE>
    <DATE>2019-08-14 18:12:54</DATE>
    <TEXT>Hey, so since I did one of these for _Castle of Cagliostro_, I figured I'm just going to do this for every Miyazaki film that Griffin and David do.**(Note: if I end up finding more interesting facts, I'll probably end up editing this to include them)**: _  #8226; The film is actually based on [a manga Miyazaki wrote and drew himself](https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/511q5TFJixL._SY445_.jpg). His higher-ups thought that an animated film was likely to bomb if it wasn't adapted from another work, so he wrote it specifically so the film itself could be funded. However, even after _Nausica #228;_ finished its theatrical run, Miyazaki continued to write the manga off-and-on for ten more years. The manga has been translated in [multiple languages, including English Spanish, French and Italian](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nausica%C3%A4_of_the_Valley_of_the_Wind_(manga)). - #8226; In a different interview (seen on Disney's U.S. Bluray), Miyazaki says he created _Nausica #228;_ at Toshio Suzuki's request at a time when he wasn't getting work  #8211; though almost immediately after, he was hired as animation director for _Sherlock Hound_  #8211; and so he intentionally made a story that could not be easily adapted to animation #8230; and then he was asked to do exactly that. - #8226; As per usual with his life #8217;s work, Miyazaki is not proud of a lot of what he did on this film/series. Much of the commentary accompanying various watercolour posters in the artbook are him saying how drawings "look[ed] wrong" or were too difficult to make or something else (for any newcomers, the man is known to be one of the most relentless self-critics in existence and has a well-deserved reputation for grumpiness, so this is just par for the course. At this point, most fans ignore him when he criticizes himself). - #8226; The original Japanese version has Sumi Shimamoto (Fillyjonk in the _Moomins_ anime; Kanata Izumi from _Lucky Star_), [Goro Naya](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gor%C5%8D_Naya)(Inspector Zenigata from _Lupin III_  amp; The Great Leader from _Kamen Rider_), and [Ichir #333; Nagai](https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/IchiroNagai) (Karin-sama and Tsuru Sennin in Dragon Ball) in lead roles as Nausica #228;, Lord Yopa, and Mito respectively. - o This movie was from before Miyazaki decided he hated working with professional seiyuu and switched to using on-camera actors instead. - #8226; When it comes to Pejite #8217;s name, the kana ( #12506; #12472; #12486;) suggests it should be pronounced "Pehzh-tay" (which is how the original says it), but the English dub pronounces it "Pedj-eye'tt". - #8226; Several characters' names are different depending upon the translation, as are some terms. - o Sea Of Corruption (manga) vs. Sea Of Decay (DVD/BD subs) vs. Toxic Jungle (English dub) - o The Princess of Pejitei: Rastel (manga) vs. Lastel (DVD subtitles) vs. Lastelle (Bluray credits) - o Torumekia (manga) vs. Tolmekia (DVD/BD) - o Pejitei (manga) vs. Pejite (DVD/BD) - o Ohmu (manga) vs. Ohm (English dub). The official subtitles are inconsistent on this one  #8211; DVD says "Ohmu", Bluray says "Ohm". - o God-Warrior (manga) vs. Giant Warrior (movie) - o Mehve (manga) vs. M #246;we (German for "gull" and clearly what Miyazaki intended with  #12513; #12540; #12532;). The movie's English subtitles and dub ignore the term and just call it Nausica #228;'s glider. - #8226; [_Nausica #228;_ is the last Ghibli film to have video games based on it](https://hg101.kontek.net/nausicaa/nausicaa.htm). - #8226; [Maki Ooyamada from the _Lupin III_ inspired Nausicaa who was also voiced by Sumi Shimamoto.](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0691584/) _ Not facts about the film but still cool: - #8226; [The Opensky Aircraft Project](https://www.youtube.com/user/hachiyakazuhiko), a group of amateur aviation enthusiasts in Japan who are attempting to create a working version of the M #246;we. Ghibli apparently offered them official endorsement, but they declined because they didn't want Miyazaki and his crew to get in trouble if things went bad and somebody died during testing. As of July 31st 2016, they have flown a successful [test flight]( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=17elclJuXxQ) of it. - #8226; This film was one of the main inspirations for the game [Hyper Light Drifter](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyper_Light_Drifter).</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Reading this article and reading the comments here is certainly a unique, engaging discussion, especially after that _Enter the Anime_ documentary turned out to be just an hour-long advertisement. I always thought that Netflix streaming the _World Masterpiece Theater_ anime collection would be a great opportunity for them, but I read somewhere that they don't like picking up non-dubbed anime (most of the shows in _WMT_ were dubbed, just not in English).</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Good stuff from the comments:  gt;We can't enforce the gender binary like we used to, but we have our ways. One trick is to tell 'em stories that don't go anywhere - like the time I caught the ferry over to Shelbyville. I needed a new heel for my shoe, so, I decided to go to Morganville, which is what they called Shelbyville in those days. So I tied an onion to my belt, which was the style at the time. Now, to take the ferry cost a nickel, and in those days, nickels had pictures of bumblebees on 'em. "Give me five bees for a quarter," you'd say.  gt;Now where were we? Oh yeah: the important thing was I had an onion on my belt, which was the style at the time. They didn't have white onions because of the war. The only thing you could get was those big yellow ones...</TEXT>

    <TITLE>Facts about "Laputa: Castle in the Sky" for before  amp; after the film</TITLE>
    <DATE>2019-08-23 23:50:30</DATE>
    <TEXT>I made these posts hoping Griffin  amp; David would notice them, but that seems like wishful thinking now. I'm going back to college soon, and I may not have time to do these before the newest episodes in this series are released. Anyway, here's some facts for now. **Original version (JP):** **Dubs:** - The word "Laputa" was dropped from the title in the Spanish and US releases because it means "the whore" in Spanish. Miyazaki took the name from _Gulliver #8217;s Travels_, likely without even realizing that Jonathan Swift had chosen the name for that very reason. However, most international releases of the film kept the word anyway. It is exclusively called _Laputa_ in Australia. - Joe Hisaishi doesn't consider his original score for the film one of his better works, noting that he didn't have a lot of time to get it put together compared to his other soundtracks. This explains both its unusually minimalist and electronic direction (as synthesizers, while expensive, are versatile enough to imitate multiple instruments from a single unit) and the decision to produce a new, more elaborate score for Disney's dub of the film; Hisaishi strongly prefers the new score, to the point where it was the only one of the two to see a CD release. - Pazu and Sheeta (both at approximately 13-14; it's never stated in the movie) are voiced in the Disney English version by (fittingly enough) James Van Der Beek (21) and Anna Paquin (17), and sound considerably more mature than their intended ages. Longtime fans of the original Japanese version have stated this as a point of contention, while others don't find it so distracting. - A significant amount of background chatter as well as one-liners were added (even more so than in Disney's dub of Kiki's Delivery Service), filling in moments of silence and increasing the frenetic effect of certain scenes. - The dub distributed by Streamline Pictures only saw a few releases, all of which are out of print. - Several modifications in the English dub, were made to the Dola gang's dialogue regarding Sheeta, including a declaration of love by one of the pirates. In the original Japanese version, the dialogue presented Sheeta as a potential mother figure to the pirates, rather than a potential romantic interest. - Ironically, the soundtrack of the US score is only available for purchase in Japan. The English dub with said soundtrack was admittedly included as a bonus feature on the Japanese Blu-ray. The rescore is also on the Australian and UK BD releases. Recently, however, the film has been reissued by Gkids, giving viewers the opportunity to view the dub with either score. **Other**: - One of the lines during the climax is [a huge meme in Japan.](https://knowyourmeme.com/memes/events/balse)</TEXT>

    <TITLE>Some Cool Facts about  amp; Analysis for "My Neighbor Totoro".</TITLE>
    <DATE>2019-08-27 16:32:40</DATE>
    <TEXT>I watched one of the Fathom Events for this film last night (subtitled) as part GKIDS #8217; Studio Ghibli Fest this year . It was my 1st time watching the film, and it was great! It was a neat surprise to see [We Bare Bears creator Daniel Chong introduce the film](https:/twitter.com/threebarebears/status/1161029712904241152). Anyway, here are some facts  amp; analysis I did for _My Neighbor Totoro_ _( #12392; #12394; #12426; #12398; #12488; #12488; #12525;)_: **Original Japanese Ver.:** - Mei and Satsuki's father is voiced by Shigesato Itoi, who is a well-known essayist and copywriter in Japan. Westerners probably know him best as the creator of the MOTHER/Earthbound game series. **Dubs:** - The [Streamline Dub](http://animeenglishdubreviews.blogspot.com/2010/05/my-neighbor-totoro-disney-and.html) licensed by 20th Century Fox has been out of print since 2004, leading some to go so far as to distribute it on file sharing sites, extending its reach to new viewers. - The Disney dub has an all-star cast, with Dakota Fanning and her sister Elle in the lead roles, also starring Tim Daly, Lea Salonga, Pat Carroll, and in the title role of Totoro, Frank Welker! **Development:** - The film was originally developed as one of the first drafts of _Princess Mononoke_ way back in 1981, featuring a little girl and a large cat-like creature in ancient Japan. At some point, these plans were revisited as a starting point for _My Neighbor Totoro_, while the concept for Mononoke would continue being revised over the years until eventually being released as the infamously dark-toned final product in 1997. - In the original post-proto-Mononoke drafts, Mei and Satsuki were one person, who had visual traits of both, but Miyazaki later realized that a four-year-old wouldn't realistically be independent enough for the plot to work. This single character is featured in the original [US DVD cover](https://www.animationmagazine.net/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/poster_totoro.jpg) due to a miscommunication. **Fathom Event Fun Facts:** - Despite Totoro's huge size, Hayao Miyazaki believes he lives on acorns. - The film was based on a children's book Miyazaki conceptualized while working on the TV series ["3000 Miles in Search of Mother"](https://www.animenewsnetwork.com/encyclopedia/anime.php?id=436). - The Totoro can live to be over a thousand years old. - In 2005, a full-scale replica of the Kusakabe house was built for the World Fair in Nagoya. It's construction was overseen by Goro Miyazaki. - According to Miyazaki, "the Cat Bus once assumed the shape of a rickshaw carrier, but the sight of a bus rumbling by excited it so much it turned itself into one." **Influence:** - Mei has become a top ten baby name in Japan thanks it being the name of one of the girls in the movie. In 2014, [it was the most popular girl name]( https://blogs.wsj.com/japanrealtime/2014/12/02/haruto-mei-top-list-of-most-popular-names-in-japan/). - This film is listed as #27 on the British Film Institute #8217;s [List of Films You Should See By the Age of 14](https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/ListOfFilmsYouShouldSeeByTheAgeOf14). - This film is on Roger Ebert's [Great Movies List](https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RogerEbertGreatMoviesList). - This film is also one of the many influences for [Pendelton Ward, creator of _Adventure Time_](http://tomdjones.blogspot.com/2013/04/the-influences-on-pendleton-ward-and.html). In the _The Art of Ooo_ book, he details coming across a VHS tape of the film in his teen years, in Korean with English fansubs. **Analysis:** - Based on my observation, this film is both the most referenced Studio Ghibli film  amp; Miyazaki-directed film in popular culture and all of media. What with the [constantly referenced bus stop scene](https://knowyourmeme.com/memes/totoro-bus-stop-parodies) or the character of Totoro [making cameos in films and television](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0096283/movieconnections/?tab=mc amp;ref_=tt_trv_cnn). Just look at how many times the big boi is [name-dropped in hip-hop!!!](https://genius.com/search?q=Totoro). - I #8217;ve noticed that with the exception of _Ponyo_, _My Neighbor Totoro_ seems to more influenced by American animated films, rather than French animated films like the rest of the films Hayao Miyazaki has directed (just listen to the SFX at certain points). - I think this [review from Letterboxd](https://letterboxd.com/daveyjenkins/film/my-neighbor-totoro/) sums a lot of things up:  gt;"No plot. No central character. No antagonist. No defined purpose for side characters. No threat. No three acts. No jokes. No punchlines. No explanations. No internal references. No catch phrases. No political polemical voice. No melodrama. No lessons. No beginning. No end. One of the best movies ever made."</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I'm back in college so I don't have time to make the facts posts now (maybe later this week). In the meantime here's a neat discussion of the film with another podcast I listen, too. They even have [a website](https://www.animationforadults.com/). _**The AFA Podcast** is back, as we continue our journey through the **Studio Ghibli** archive with Hayao Miyazaki's **Kiki's Delivery Service**, which recently celebrated its 30th anniversary._ _**Rachael** and her familiars **Dan** and **Chris** take off for a deep dive into the film, discussing the plot, themes and history films as well as our personal connection to the film. If you haven't seen the film yet, make sure you check it out before listening!_</TEXT>

    <TITLE>Facts About  amp; Analysis for "Princess Mononoke"</TITLE>
    <DATE>2019-09-12 22:11:10</DATE>
    <TEXT>Sorry, wasn't able to make a list for _Kiki's Delivery Service_. Haven't seen it yet. I have seen _Princess Mononoke_ _( #12418; #12398; #12398; #12369; #23019;)_. *(Note: You may a have seen a pot like this eariler today. That's because I deleted that one because I misspelled the film title)* Here are some facts and Anaylsis: STILL UPDATING UNTIL 09/14/2019 **Development**: - Miyazaki first envisioned the concept for the film in the late 1970s. The earliest concepts Miyazaki had that involved a Mononoke spirit was actually his re-telling of _Beauty and the Beast_. - More early concept art details a version of the film starring a prototypical Satsuki and Totoro in ancient Japan; it's likely that this is what provided the basis for Totoro's own film in 1988. This artwork did eventually see a public release in the art book _Princess Mononoke: The First Story_. - Hayao Miyazaki took 16 years to fully develop the characters and plot of the film. - The film #8217;s production itself started in 1994 and took over 2 years to complete. - At first Miyazaki was reluctant to finish, but his producer (Toshio Suzuki) told him he was getting old and that it could be his last chance to make an action film. - The production team composed over 140,000 animation cels (not counting the cels that weren #8217;t used). There #8217;s no official count, but it #8217;s estimated that Miyazaki drew around 80,000 of them himself, while also overseeing the creation of every cel. - Approximately 10% of the film was made digitially, the rest being hand-drawn. **Original Japanese version:** - _Princess Mononoke_ is the first Ghibli film that uses celebrities to provide the voice of the main characters of this film; since then, all of the Ghibli films used celebrities to voice the main characters. The only known professional with a named role in the movie is Sumi Shimamoto as Toki, Lady Eboshi's servant. - Moro, the wolf mom, is voiced by a man, in this case Akihiro Miwa (well-known singer, author  amp; drag queen), in the Japanese version. This comes from Japanese mythology which says that wolves are always male-voiced (and cats always female-voiced), regardless of sex. **Dubs:** - During the English dub's production, Miramax originally contacted Quentin Tarantino to write the script adaptation. Tarantino instead recommended Neil Gaiman to write the script. After Gaiman finished five drafts, Miramax went on to update his adaptation for the next six months. When that didn't go over well, Gaiman was brought back to finish the script for its final release. - Leonardo DiCaprio was considered to voice Ashitaka in the English dub. - The English dub of this film features many well-known celebrities. Billy Crudup, Claire Danes, Gillian Anderson, Minnie Driver, Billy Bob Thornton, Jada Pinkett-Smith, and Keith David, among others. **Releases:** - Disney's sale of Miramax was in the way of any possible re-release in the US for several years, although Alliance Films in Canada was still able to print its release. Miramax's rights lapsed at some point and Disney re-issued the film (officially re-printing the original DVD release from Buena Vista Home Entertainment re-badged in Disney's Ghibli package design and with almost every mention of Miramax removed) in 2012, with a Blu-ray release in 2014. GKIDS would gain the home media rights to the film in 2017 (with distribution by Shout! Factory).</TEXT>

    <TITLE>"Spirited Away" Facts  amp; Analysis</TITLE>
    <DATE>2019-10-02 02:56:51</DATE>
    <TEXT>If anyone was wondering where this post, some personal stuff came up. My Grandma recently passed away, and I wasn't in a great mood to post facts and whatnot. I have the next 2 films' fact lists ready, so you'll see those much earlier. Thanks for waiting: **Inspiration:** - The idea for the film comes from Miyazaki wanted to make a film 10-year old girls could relate to. **Development:** - Yasuyoshi Tokuma, the chief executive producer of Spirited Away and president of Tokuma Shoten, died during the early stages of production in September 2000. - Zeniba's design was originally planned to be much more distinct from Yubaba's, being taller and thinner, but there wasn't enough room to develop an entirely new character who didn't appear until late in the film. Then it was suggested that they could be distinguished by the number of rings they wore, but it was difficult to keep track of that, so Zeniba ended up looking exactly the same as Yubaba. **Original Japanese Version:** - Takashi Naito, the voice of Chihiro's father, is a longtime fan of Miyazaki's works. **Dubs:** - After the lackluster box office showing for Princess Mononoke, Disney executives were hesitant to move forward with more of the Studio Ghibli films they'd bought the rights for. Castle in the Sky had been dubbed and shown up on the film festival circuit, but no proper release date was announced, and it seemed like the other Ghibli films would be lost in Development Hell. The happy ending? John Lasseter, then the head of Pixar, stuck his neck out to push for Spirited Away's production and release in America. Lasseter's championing of the film, and its eventual Oscar win, was the impetus for the eventual release of the rest of the Ghibli catalog on DVD, as well as the distribution of future Ghibli films. - While the rest of the English dub had to be a perfect syllable-for-syllable match-up, John Ratzenberger was allowed to improvise new lyrics to the assistant manager's little song. The line "Now that's an esophagus!" (said after No-Face spits him out) was also his idea. - In the Taiwanese and Hong Kong dubs, Haku is voiced by Wang Shizhen and Can Ngonjing respectively. - There are two Latin American Spanish dubs, both made simultaneously. One produced by Disney made in Mexico City-based Prime Dubb/SDI Media de M #233;xico (broadcasted in HBO) and another one produced by Primer Plano made in Buenos Aires-based Videorecord for their theatrical distribution in Argentina. Both dubs were made for the cinemas. When Disney bought Primer Plano's Argentine theatrical rights of Spirited Away, they decided to release it with the Argentine dub instead of their own dub. To this date, the Argentine dub it's the most distributed in the region, being the only one ever released on home video and broadcasted on air TV and Disney Latino has come to distribute it in streaming and TV broadcasts in Disney Channel and Jetix; the Mexican dub, however... **Other:** - The film is #7 on List of Films You Should See By the Age of 14. **Analysis:** - Chihiro and Haku #8217;s story isn #8217;t over</TEXT>

    <TITLE>"Howl's Moving Castle" Facts  amp; Analysis</TITLE>
    <DATE>2019-10-05 23:51:08</DATE>
    <TEXT>So, yeah, this will be the only facts page for a while (that is if I don't end up doing _Porco Rosso_ or _Kiki's Delievery Service_) as our two buddies will be reviewing _Joker_ and _Gemini Man_. Enjoy! **Inspiration:** - As we all know by now, with the movie being anti-war and whatnot, Miyazaki was heavily influenced by [the United States' invasion of Iraq in 2003]( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2003_invasion_of_Iraq), which he greatly opposed. - This is not so much based on the novel by Dianne Jones but the cover. Miyazaki wondered how a castle that huge could move, and thus added his interpretation in to the film. **Development:** - Director Mamoru Hosoda was originally brought on to helm the project, but was taken off during the early stages of production. He left after his ideas for the film were rejected. **Original Japanese Version:** - Due to phonetic translation from English to Japanese and back, the character known as Michael in the books became "Markl" in the film. To make matters worse, whenever his name is spoken, it sounds more like "Marco" than anything else... o The Swedish and Norwegian dub doesn't only have the same mistranslation, they also call Howl "Hauru", for the same reasons. Slightly justified in that they were trying to lip sync the movie, but it still comes off a bit awkward. - [Production Diary](http://www.nausicaa.net/miyazaki/howl/diary.html **Dubs:** - Christian Bale uses an American accent in the English dub of the film. Ironically, Howl's eventually revealed backstory in the book reveals him to be a Welshman, i.e. native to Wales, like Bale himself! If he wanted, or maybe was allowed, he could've just played him with his natural accent and it would've been more fitting. Then again, Howl's backstory isn't even remotely touched upon in the film, among many other aspects of the book, so it would probably just have been something for the book readers. - Howl's called "Hauro" in the German dub and the mistranslation of Markl also took place. This is justified, as in Japanese (the original language of the film), Howl is written (and pronounced) "Hauru" ( #12495; #12454; #12523;). Neither "Hauru" nor "Howl" have a meaning of their own in German, anyway, and the original book is all but unknown there. The German title just translates to "The Strolling Castle". - The same thing happens with the name of Sophie's (step)mother. In the book her name was "Fanny". While she is never called by name in the movie, her name is written as "Honey" in the art book. The romaji for both words is different (Fanny =  #12501; #12449; #12491; #12540;, Honey =  #12495; #12491; #12540;), but the pronunciation is nearly identical ("Fan #299;" and "Han #299;", respectively). **Reception:** - The film has won many awards, [as listed here](http://www.nausicaa.net/miyazaki/howl/credits.html#awards). - Diana Wynne Jones loved the film, stating:  #8220;It's fantastic. No, I have no input #8212;I write books, not films. Yes, it will be different from the book #8212;in fact it's likely to be very different, but that's as it should be. It will still be a fantastic film #8221;. Although she said that she originally envisioned Howl's castle as floating around, she liked Miyazaki's "legged" interpretation, and reprintings of the book made after the movie feature a legged version of the castle. It also seems to have inspired Mrs. Jones to write additional stories of Howl and Sophie, and while a third was published, she passed away while writing the fourth. **:Analysis:** - This would be the 1st of many instances of Hayao coming out of retirement. As he states in [this interview](http://www.nausicaa.net/miyazaki/interviews/XinJinBao.html), _ #8220;Although I have thought about leaving the world of animation for many times, whenever I see a piece of work that I really like, I would naturally want it to express it in my own ideas. When I hand it to the others, I always think about how this and that should be done. At last, I feel that it will be better if I take up the work myself. In order to bring out the original spirit of the work, I can only return. #8221;_ - This is Miyazaki's favorite of his movies. - Ironically, this also appears to be the movie of Miyazaki #8217;s [that people like the least.]( https://www.animenewsnetwork.com/feature/2017-09-13/the-best-of-studio-ghibli/.121303) - It is well-known that Hayao Miyazaki does not do adaptations, he simply uses the source material as a convenient jumping off point to tell his own story. This film is definitely a good example of that.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Absolutely. Call me crazy, but think people not being able to tell the difference is in part due to our current sociopolitical climate, where it feels like there is this want for every major film to portray this clear idea of "good"; almost like what happened with _Once Upon a Time In Hollywood_ (most of the hot takes could be summed up as "anything portray in a film uncritically means that the filmmakers wholly endorse it).</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Don't know if you care, but I thought I'd let you know that there was an extra episode from a leftover script the crew made after the show was finished (you know, from the planned 20 episodes). There was also a script for an episode called "R*ped", which would explore Miss Sculptham's homosexuality in a relationship with a police officer.

    <TEXT>Recorded by _Play Pause Video_ This definitely an early capsule into gaming culture in the mid-2000s. Having never watched Spike TV growing up (was born in 1996), this feels like every negative stereotype of gamers and teenage boys rolled into one, while a healthy(?) dose of _**THE TROOPS**_. **From Wikipedia:**  gt;The 2005 VGAs was held December 10, 2005, at the Gibson Amphitheatre in Los Angeles. The first VGAs hosted by Samuel L. Jackson, the show featured world premieres of _24: The Game_ from 2K Games, _Spy Hunter: Nowhere to Run_ from Midway Games, _Star Wars: Empire at War_ from LucasArts, and _Scarface: The World Is Yours_, as well as a 25th anniversary comic tribute to _Pac-Man_ from Namco. Musical performances were by 50 Cent, Def Leppard, and Missy Elliott, and show appearances by Charlize Theron, Kiefer Sutherland, Jack Black, Red Hot Chili Peppers, The Rock, Vin Diesel, Carson Daly, Donald Faison, Jaime Pressly, Josie Maran, Snoop Dogg, Xzibit, Carmen Electra, Natasha Bedingfield, and Dane Cook, among others.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>From the uploader: _[Jane Meikle](https://twitter.com/janemeikle) hosted prime time movies on SCREAM (and some filler shorts/skits) from 2001-'04 as various personalities/characters. There was: Mistress Olga, a well mannered dominatrix who had a guy locked up behind that chained door (he had a name but I forget it); Tiff, a horror movie trope valley girl; Nancy, a naive British schoolgirl; And Sharon Stokowski a newscaster who often treated the movies like real events. Now that I've uploaded this Olga segment all of Jane's characters are on YouTube except for Tiff, unfortunately. In late '04 and '05 they reran Jane's segments and introduced a new host, Amy Lalonde. Amy played it straight and simply talked about the movie and trivia. By '06, there were no hosts, and the channel lost a lot of character._</TEXT>

    <TITLE>Some Cool Facts about  amp; Analysis for "Ponyo"</TITLE>
    <DATE>2019-10-26 19:02:24</DATE>
    <TEXT>Ponyo _( #23830; #12398; #19978; #12398; #12509; #12491; #12519;)_ is one of my favourite Studio Ghibli films, so I was dissapointed to not find that many facts about it. If you know any, comment below so I may add them here: **Development:** - No CGI was used during this film, at **_all_**. **Original Japanese Version:** - As with all Ghibli films since 1997, several famous actors and comedians provide several roles in the film, such as [Tomoko Yamaguchi](http://asianwiki.com/Tomoko_Yamaguchi), George Tokoro, [Kazushige Nagashima](http://asianwiki.com/Kazushige_Nagashima), [Yuki Amami](http://asianwiki.com/Yuki_Amami), [Tomoko Naraoka](http://asianwiki.com/Tomoko_Naraoka), and [Kazuko Yoshiyuki](http://asianwiki.com/Kazuko_Yoshiyuki). [Rumi Hiiragi](http://asianwiki.com/Rumi_Hiragi), who voiced Chihiro in _Spirited Away_, voices the young mother. - Joe Hisaishi's daughter Mai sings vocals on several cues of the film's score. Mai even sang the image song "Rondo of the House of Sunflowers". - Miyazaki made Ponyo as a means of trying to reconcile with his estranged son, Goro (he directed _Tales from Earthsea_). Throughout the film, Sosuke and his father are separated. **Dubs:** - The English dub Disney made has an all-star cast including Matt Damon, Tina Fey, Cate Blanchett, Liam Neeson, Betty White, Lily Tomlin, and Cloris Leachman. - For the English dub, Megan Marshall, the daughter of the English version's executive producers Frank Marshall and Kathleen Kennedy, suggested that Frankie Jonas and Noah Cyrus should play Sosuke and Ponyo, respectively. - As of writing this film is Noah Cyrus #8217; (Ponyo) only major voiceover role. - According to TV Tropes, Hayao Miyazaki was impressed by the film's English dub. **Analysis:** - Like [My Neighbor Totoro](https://www.reddit.com/r/blankies/comments/cw6vs1/some_cool_facts_about_analysis_for_my_neighbor/) before, this film appears to be more inspired by American animated films rather than French animated films. - It's an known fact throughout all of the films discussed that Hayao Miyazaki does _not_ do adaptations, he simply uses the source material as a convenient jumping off point to tell his own story. This film is Hans Christian Anderson's "inspired" by _The Little Mermaid_</TEXT>

It reached number four on the Canada pop chart.  gt;Like its inspiration "Do They Know It's Christmas", it is a charity song, with all proceeds being donated to UNICEF.

    <TITLE>Some Cool Facts  amp; Analysis for "The Wind Rises"</TITLE>
    <DATE>2019-11-02 20:44:52</DATE>
    <TEXT>Well we've reached the end, guys! I'll be honest, was hoping these posts would be more noteworthy when I started them. I haven't seen all the films, but I tried to get as many facts as I could (heck I left out some because I figured Griffin  amp; David would cover them, and they never did!!!) I forgot to do one for _Porco Rosso_ even (the French dub is Miyazaki's favourite and preferred viewing experience). I got better planning to do for next time. Thank you to everyone who took the time read my posts, and here's a cheer to the guys hopefully doing Richard Linklater in the future!: **Inspiration:** - While Jiro Horikoshi actually existed in Real Life, and he did design the aircraft shown in the movie, his Love Interest is fictional. He had an older brother instead of a younger sister, and was a non-smoker in real life despite his frequent smoking in the movie. Much of the portrayal of Jiro Horikoshi, especially in regard to his personal life, is based on Tatsuo Hori instead, to whom the movie is dedicated as well. Two of Tatsuo Hori's novels,_Kaze Tachinu_ and _Naoko_ are major inspirations for the film according to Word of God. **Development:** - The protagonist, [Jiro Horikoshi](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jiro_Horikoshi), was a Real Life aircraft designer under the employment of Mitsubishi, and is responsible for the design of various warplanes used by the Japanese military, most famous of which being the A6M Zero. - Jiro's friend and colleague, Honjo, is heavily implied to be based on Kiro Honjo, another Mitsubishi engineer that designed [G1M](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mitsubishi_G1M) reconnaissance aircraft and its bomber variant, [G3M "Nell"](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mitsubishi_G3M). - Jiro's superior, Hattori, is said to be based on Joji Hattori, another real Mitsubishi aeronautics engineer. - Although he never really appears in the movie, [Caproni](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Giovanni_Battista_Caproni) is a frequent guest in Jiro's dreams, serving as a mentor and inspiration for Jiro. - [Hugo Junkers](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hugo_Junkers) also makes a brief appearance as Jiro and his colleagues tour in his aircraft workshop for technological exchange. **Original Japanese Version:** - In the original Japanese, American Stephen Alpert voices the German Castorp. Averted in the English dub, where Castorp is voiced by Munich-born Werner Herzog. - Ghibli's ex-animator Hideaki Anno voices Jiro in the original dub even if he's more a friend of Miyazaki than a fanboy. **Dubs:** - Peekskill, New York-born Stanley Tucci provides the voice of the Italian Caproni in the English dub. Curiously enough, Tucci is also of Italian descent. - Emily Blunt eventually became a dual-US/UK citizen but still speaks with a British accent. She uses an American one in this film. **Other:** - The film is dedicated to Jiro Horikoshi and Tatsuo Hori, who died several years before the film was produced. The movie's ending theme _Hikoukigumo_ is an old pop-song from 1973 by Yumi Matsutoya, who also performed the theme songs to _Kiki's Delivery Service_. When Miyazaki first heard the song, he immediately decided that it simply had to be the movie's theme-song. - When GKIDS acquired the license to all the Ghibli films, they didn't license The Wind Rises since Disney still owns the rights to it as of 2019. **Analysis:** - The title of the film is from a poem about grasping the opportunities that life presents, but when you know that the film is set in Japan from the 1920s to the 1940s, other interpretations also present themselves. - Any scene featuring flight is a particularly beautiful example of scenic beauty. Even by Miyazaki standards, the animation is astounding. Among the best if not the best-looking animation ever. (And then you consider this was all done by hand, no computer assistance.)</TEXT>

After digging into how Alex Toth's fantastical superhero became the face of Cartoon Network's dadaist comedy, we dig into a double-length episode from 1996 where Penn  amp; Teller and Joel Hodgson of Mystery Science Theater 3000 join the show for a Kubrick-tribute. There's all you can eat birthday cake and illegal Ultra Seven all in this week's podcast, so strap on your powerbands and enjoy!_</TEXT>

    <TEXT>If you're wondering why most of these examples are characters from children's cartoons, I figured most people's 1st-hand experience with this realization comes from an example they thought was certainly this type (based on societal stereotypes) only for them to realize not everything can be based on specific traits. Listed here: Barbapapa from _Barbapapa_ (male) Mothra (female) Kirby from the _Kirby_ franchise_ (male) BMO from _Adventure Time_ (non-binary) Remi from _Nobody's Boy: Remi_ (male) Crono from _Soul Eater_ (non-binary) _Teletubbies_ (left to right): _Tinky Winky_ (male), Dipsy (male), Laa-Laa (female), Po (female) Kurama from _Yu Yu Hakusho_ (male) Shun from _Saint Seiya_ (male) Smellerbee from _Avatar: The Last Airbender_ (female) Cody/Iori Hida from _Digimon Adventure 02_ (male) Peppermint Patty from _Peanuts_ (female) Charlie from _Charlie  amp; Lola_ (male) Piglet from _Winnie the Pooh_ (male) Blue from _Blue's Clues_ (female) I would've included others like Lady Oscar and whatnot, but the image was getting big.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Nope. From [TV Tropes](https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AmbiguousGender):  gt; Japanese doesn't have to use gendered pronouns, and doesn't in this case. Any cases of "guy" or "daughter" in fan translations are so far just the translator's guesses. The author has stated that he neither knows nor cares what Crona's true gender is. The official English dub refers to Crona using male pronouns, but only because the writers (who are just as clueless) didn't want to resort using neutral pronouns 'it/they' because of the assumption that it would be "insulting" to Crona as a character. It also has Medusa refer to Crona as "my child" or "it" to avoid any gender orientation, with the later doubling as a Woolseyism since it reflects how she treats Crona. Likewise, all the other characters far more often say Crona's name instead of using he, she, him, or her. There is also a strong possibility that Crona is neither or both. Oddly, in-series Crona's androgyny is never commented upon except when Patty asks if Crona is a boy or girl when Kid fought Crona on the Nidhogg.</TEXT>

Yes, it's time for the best Seth MacFarlane show, American Dad!, as we deconstruct the weird absurdity of this unexpectedly great follow up to Family Guy!

    <TITLE>Over Two Dozen Animated Shorts Contending For An Oscar Are Free To View Online. Watch Them Here. (LIMITED TIME ONLY)</TITLE>
    <DATE>2019-12-08 02:19:50</DATE>
    <TEXT>https://www.cartoonbrew.com/shorts/over-two-dozen-shorts-contending-for-an-oscar-are-free-to-view-online-watch-them-here-183099.html I did one of these lists last year and which was a success. Cartoon Brew is handy as always, so I figured, why not do it again? For those that can't access the article: _This year, a record 92 animated shorts are in the running for an Academy Award. We published a preliminary list of qualified films here, along with the criteria for qualifying._ _Of the 92 shorts, more than two dozen are currently available to view for free online. Scroll down to watch them all, in alphabetical order._ _A caveat: their availability is subject to change  #8212; some will be temporarily taken offline again, while other qualified shorts will go online in the near future. If you want to make sure you see all of these shorts, you should watch them promptly._ _The 92 films will be whittled down to a 10-film shortlist, to be announced on Monday, December 16._ **_ACID RAIN_  #8212; Tomek Popakul (Poland)** [Published by Animoon] [Vimeo link {STAFF PICK}](https://vimeo.com/373404085) **_Blind Mice_  #8212; Nicholas D #8217;Agostino (USA)** [Published by Pox Films Inc.] [Vimeo link {STAFF PICK}](https://vimeo.com/331204675) **_Cops  amp; Robbers (R #228;uber  amp; Gendarm)_  #8212; Florian Maubach (Germany)** [Published by Sticky Frames] [Vimeo link {STAFF PICK}](https://vimeo.com/307561720) **_Don #8217;t Feed These Animals_  #8212; Guilherme Afonso, Miguel Mada #237;l de Freitas (Portugal)** [Published by Nebula Studios] [Vimeo link](https://vimeo.com/321719957) **_Earth_  #8212; Federico Heller, Nigel W.

    <TEXT>Animated by Klasky-Csupo (_Rugrats, The Wild Thornberrys, As Told By Ginger_). There were two other shorts previous to this one that you can watch [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AzYczrowbhk) and [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3FZThvUbuAs) Lily Tomlin voices the titular character. [(More info)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edith_Ann:_A_Few_Pieces_of_the_Puzzle) From the [official Peabody Awards website](http://www.peabodyawards.com/award-profile/edith-anns-christmas-just-say-noel):  gt;While it might appear on the surface that this Yule-tide tale strays from the mainstream, it presents positive and especially timely messages of caring and forgiveness. Irreverent and often outrageous, _Edith Ann #8217;s Christmas (Just Say Noel)_ offers an alternative perspective to the emotional landscape usually available in popular entertainment to children and adults. The show revolves around a dysfunctional family, with the main character, Edith Ann, portrayed by the multi-talented Lily Tomlin, (also co-executive producer). In the innovative story, Edith Ann #8217;s rebellious sister Irene defies her parents and then decides to run away. Edith Ann, like her parents, feels guilty about the situation, and frantically attempts to contact Irene. Meanwhile, Edith Ann and her friends are also preparing for the school #8217;s holiday play, a fundraiser for the victims of a recent drive-by shooting, a boy and his dog. Following a creative, updated version of  #8220;O, Little Town of Bethlehem #8221; (replete with a heartfelt postscript by Edith Ann), the show #8217;s two main crises are solved. Irene returns home, and the boy recovers from a coma. In a world which often surrounds us with a general devaluing of the human spirit, _Edith Ann #8217;s Christmas (Just Say Noel)_ creates an emotionally complex and deeply empathetic haven where it is okay to confront our vulnerabilities through humor and storytelling. Co-executive producer and writer Jane Wagner contributes a biting commentary about modern America in her script, which producer/director Bob Kurtz brings to life in lovely characterization and animation. For its unique and entertaining display of holiday spirit, a Peabody to _Edith Ann #8217;s Christmas (Just Say Noel)_. With this type of acknowledgement, I'm surprised these shorts aren't on any kind of physical media.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>From German Wikipedia:  gt;_GIGA \\ GAMES_ dealt with PC and console games . The program ran from November 30, 2000 to August 2008. Most recently, the program was one of the main pillars of GIGA; the name and basic ideas of the format were continued in the individual GIGA-GAMES thematic blocks until the station closed . Initially broadcast directly to GIGA (green) , i.e. from 8:00 p.m. to 10:00 p.m., _GIGA \\ GAMES_ was then moved to 22:00 p.m. by two hours in order to do justice to the protection of minors. Until December 2006 there was also _GIGA \\ GAMES_ weekend , a weekend edition of _GIGA \\ GAMES_, The show was divided into different subject areas that changed over time. Most recently, these were PC , console , MAXX area, which dealt with hardware as well as mods and maps for PC games.</TEXT>

But for four glorious seasons, Home Movies adapted the limited animation and naturalistic conversations of Dr. Katz to something with a little more ambition that wasn't necessarily tied to stand-up comedy bits. On this episode, join Bob, Henry, and Talking Futurama/What A Cartoon!/One Piece Podcast artist [Maddie Copp](https://twitter.com/othatsraspberry) as your podcast friends explore season two's "The Party."_</TEXT>

    <TEXT>For those who don't know Chad Rocco is an internet media guy that had a series of videos called ["Familiar Faces"](https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WebVideo/FamiliarFaces), with the premise being analyzing and/or giving insight to an under-appreciated or ill-known character or series. It's one of the best things to come out of Channel Awesome. You can find all the videos on his YouTube channel and he still makes some here and there, but for now, he spends most of his time on Twitter.

    <TEXT>[More info on the CN City Era](https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Advertising/CNCity) You can find more of these continuity announcements on YouTube by looking up "CN City credits". This comment on the video sums up my thoughts: _"There was always something special about these endings. They were often overlooked, admittedly they were a small detail, but the way they had stories of other characters from other shows and things in that nature, followed by "This is Cartoon Network" really helped bring the network, and its viewers, closer together."_</TEXT>

    <TITLE>Some Facts  amp; Trivia for "The Witches of Eastwick"</TITLE>
    <DATE>2020-04-16 22:34:54</DATE>
    <TEXT>Exactly what the title says. **Development:** - George Miller took umbrage with his first exposure to Hollywood. He claims that his suggestions to downsize his personal needs, such as his own trailer, informed studio heads that he was a pushover and would kowtow to their more outlandish demands. The process therefor became much less enjoyable because it meant he had to "get mean" to get what he wanted. - According to George Miller, producer Jon Peters suddenly decided he wanted aliens to appeared on the movie, even though it didn't make sense with the story. Miller thinks that Peters was influenced by the box office success of Aliens. He even showed up one day on set with a stunt man dressed as an alien and told Miller to put him on a scene, any scene. Miller and Jack Nicholson then left the set until Peters gave up on his fixation. - George Miller sacrificing his personal trailer also gave the signal to executives that they could half-ass if they wanted to (a dozen extras when he asked for fifty, one camera when he asked for two) under the impression that he was a pushover. Miller was nearly fired for refusing to work if the studio wouldn't cooperate with him until Jack Nicholson threatened to quit. **Casting:** - The role of Daryl Van Horne was originally meant for Bill Murray.. - Anjelica Huston auditioned for Alex. - Pam Grier was considered for one of the roles. - Daryl Hannah turned down a role in the film for "ethical" reasons. - Kathleen Turner was considered for Jane. Kim Cattrall auditioned for the role. - Cher was offered the role of Jane, but preferred the part of Alexandra, the role that Susan Sarandon had been hired to play. Sarandon did not discover that she would be playing Jane until she showed up on location. **Trivia:** - Jane's character believes she can't have children of her own until Daryl gets her pregnant. Susan Sarandon also thought she couldn't have children, until becoming pregnant with director Franco Amurri's child Eva Amurri Martino who was born in 1985. - John Williams' own whistling was dubbed in over Jack Nicholson's for the scene at the ice cream counter. - This movie also inspired a [series](https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Eastwick)</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Orignal comments by Hannah Gs  gt;Also my problem with the notion that  #8220;without objective criticism all art is just gonna be banana on wall #8221; is that like...not all artists want to make banana on wall. There are artists that love obsessive realism, Dadaism, Impressionism, something else entirely new. Movie makers don #8217;t all want to make the same types of films, there are those that like cheesy rom coms or action blockbusters but there are also those that want to create deep thoughtful amazing art. Like Under the Skin didn #8217;t get made BECAUSE objective criticism exists. It got made because an artist had the idea for it. Criticism of art exists because art exists not the other way around  amp; Werd Lert:  gt;This is can be generalised and applied to discussions about excessive copyrighting/intellectual property, abuse of workers, universal basic income, basically capitalism in general. Like, we are being told that without strong financial incentives there would be no artists, no scientists, no innovation, nobody would do any work... Which is not true, because our whole history is full of proof of INTRINSIC motivation, when people do great things just because they want to do those great things. And I'm not an idealist, I know laziness exists and extrinsic motivation is a thing, but it's just a small part of the picture. People are looking for meaning in their lives beyond money or social standing.</TEXT>

    <TITLE>Some Facts  amp; Trivia for "Babe: Pig in the Big City"</TITLE>
    <DATE>2020-04-30 22:35:14</DATE>
    <TEXT>Forgot to do one for _Lorenzo's Oil_. Will probably do it this weekend. **Development:** - In the trailer, there's a scene where the chefs in the ballroom are pulling on Esme's clown shoes, which would've explained how they suddenly went missing later in the sequence. This scene does not appear in the final film. - According to George Miller, producer Jon Peters suddenly decided he wanted aliens to appeared on the movie, even though it didn't make sense with the story. Miller thinks that Peters was influenced by the box office success of Aliens. He even showed up one day on set with a stunt man dressed as an alien and told Miller to put him on a scene, any scene. Miller and Jack Nicholson then left the set until Peters gave up on his fixation. - George Miller sacrificing his personal trailer also gave the signal to executives that they could half-ass if they wanted to (a dozen extras when he asked for fifty, one camera when he asked for two) under the impression that he was a pushover. Miller was nearly fired for refusing to work if the studio wouldn't cooperate with him until Jack Nicholson threatened to quit. **Casting:** - Cromwell, Szubanski, and most of the voice actors returned for the 1998 sequel. Cavanaugh declined to return and was replaced by her "Rugrats" castmate, Elizabeth Daily. - The same happens in the Mexican Spanish dub, since Babe's original voice actor ([Enzo Fortuny](https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/EnzoFortuny)) had become too old to reprise the role. - Jim Cummings the voice of the Pelican and Russi Taylor the voice of The Pink Poodle both work on several Mickey Mouse projects for Disney as the voices Minnie Mouse and Pete respectively. - This is the fourth Live-Action non animated film to feature character voice actor Jim Cummings who voices The Pelican. His two previous ones was _The Garbage Pail Kids Movie_ (1987) 31 years prior _Cabin Boy_ (1994) 5 years prior and _Who Framed Roger Rabbit_ (1988) 32 years prior. His next two Live Action films after this would be _Small Soldiers_ (1998) and then 20 years later his sixth one is _Christopher Robin_ (2018). **Release:** - Prior to the film's theatrical release, it was originally rated PG by the MPAA. The TV spots for the film's theatrical release mentioned this rating, as did a promotional poster. By the time the film was released in theaters it had been re-rated as G due to the film being re-edited and submitted again for review. - Many critics found this film superior to the original. In fact, [Gene Siskel himself picked this film for the best film of 1998.](https://siskelebert.org/?p=3347) - The film was not just a box office bomb, but the biggest flop of 1998. Budget, $90 million. Box office, $69,131,860. Director George Miller wouldn't return to live-action films of any sort until 2015. Its own box office failure would end the _Babe_ franchise after two films. - The box office failure of this and the equally expensive [_Meet Joe Black_](https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/MeetJoeBlack) led to the resignation of then Universal head Casey Silver. **Trivia:** - The view from Babe's window at the animal hotel includes the Hollywood sign, the Golden Gate Bridge, the Sydney Opera House, the Statue of Liberty, the Eiffel Tower, Big Ben, the Rio de Janiero statue of Christ, the World Trade Center, the Empire State Building, the Chrysler Building, what appears to be a Moscow cathedral, and possibly other famous landmarks. In this vista, the Christ statue overlooks the Hollywood sign, and a helicopter and airplane can be seen eerily close to the Twin Towers of the World Trade Center (though flying away from them). Signage in the film indicates the city Babe visits is called "Metropolis", which has a Metropolis Gun Club and Metropolis Institute of Medicine. - A billboard on the city skyline reads "Eternity." This refers to the eccentric mission of reformed petty criminal Arthur Stace, who in 1932 began anonymously chalking the single word "Eternity" in copperplate style on footpaths around Sydney. He continued until his death in 1967. ("Eternity" also was featured in the finale of Sydney's fireworks display on New Years Day 2000.) - Ended the Babe franchise after only two films, with a widely-panned isometric video game adaptation of the franchise released in 2006 for the PlayStation 2 ensuring its demise. - In 2011, Ron Meyer, the President and Chief Operating Officer of Universal Studios,told an audience at the Savannah (Georgia) Film Festival that Babe: Pig in the City was one of the two worst movies that Universal had ever made; the other one he singled out was _The Wolfman_.</TEXT>

    <TITLE>Some Facts, Trivia  amp; Analysis for "Happy Feet"</TITLE>
    <DATE>2020-05-04 23:21:35</DATE>
    <TEXT>This is the one George Miller film I'm most familiar with (I AM a fan of animation), so expect a lot of facts. **Development:** - George Miller cites as an initial inspiration for the film an encounter with a grizzled old cameraman, whose father was Frank Hurley of the Shackleton expeditions, during the shooting of Mad Max 2: [ #8220;We were sitting in this bar, having a milkshake, and he looked across at me and said,  #8216;Antarctica. #8217; He'd shot a documentary there. He said,  #8216;You #8217;ve got to make a film in Antarctica. It #8217;s just like out here, in the wasteland. It #8217;s spectacular. #8217; And that always stuck in my head. #8221;]( https://web.archive.org/web/20100719095940/http://www.natoonline.org/infocus/06November/happyfeet.htm) - Happy Feet was also partially inspired by earlier documentaries such as the BBC's [Life in the Freezer]( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Life_in_the_Freezer). - Production was slated to begin sometime after the completion of the fourth Mad Max film, _Fury Road_, but geo-political complications pushed _Happy Feet_ to the forefront in early 2003. - [The film needed an enormous group of computers, and Animal Logic worked with IBM to build a server farm with sufficient processing potential. The film took four years to make. Ben Gunsberger, Lighting Supervisor and VFX Department Supervisor, says this was partly because they needed to build new infrastructure and tools. The server farm used IBM BladeCenter framework and BladeCenter HS20 blade servers, which are extremely dense separate computer units each with two Intel Xeon processors. Rendering took up 17 million CPU hours over a nine-month period.](http://www-01.ibm.com/software/success/cssdb.nsf/cs/mcag-6h2sr2?opendocument amp;site=corp) - The original film was going to have **actual aliens**. - Also, some Happy Feet storybooks and posters show Mumble as a fully-fledged Emperor Penguin. This is because until late in the film's production, it was intended for Mumble to lose his down feathers during his pursuit of the fishing fleet. However, it was decided that Mumble would keep half of his juvenile down throughout the story, to make him different to the other Emperor Penguins. Here are a [couple images](https://vignette.wikia.nocookie.net/happyfeet/images/9/91/Happy_Feet_-_Adult_Mumble.JPG/revision/latest?cb=20140426033552) of [adult Mumble](https://vignette.wikia.nocookie.net/happyfeet/images/d/d0/The_Alien_Ship.JPG/revision/latest?cb=20140426040909). - Some art books and press releases include an image of a different version of the elephant seal scene. The image shows them with a much friendlier, more boisterous demeanor, and they would have been named Cletus and Jeb, suggesting they would have been hillbilly Americans rather than their final portrayal as working-class Australians. One tidbit of leaked information revealed that Cletus was voiced by Robin Williams. - A deleted scene depicts Mumble, during his pursuit of the alien ships, [running into a blue whale and having a conversation with an albatross voiced by Steve Irwin]( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uTRoagheoZE). The scene would have wreaked havoc with the film's pacing, so instead we go straight from Mumble's pursuit of the aliens to his washing up on shore. In order to keep Irwin in the film, the above elephant seal scene was modified. - Prince originally denied the filmmakers permission to use "Kiss," but then decided he wanted to see the movie first before he made a firm decision. Not only did he love the movie and ultimately give them permission, but he wrote a new song especially for its soundtrack in just one week. That song, [ #8220;The Song of the Heart #8221;]( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPmZMxGLBnI), won him a Golden Globe. **Casting:** - If what Gabriel Iglesias said is to be believed, he was actually meant to star in the film when he was starting out, but was talked out by his manager, feeling that his stand up was where he belonged. He regret not starring it because he not only did the film succeed, but whatever role he was gonna have went to Robin Williams. - While most of the character animation is done from scratch, the dancing is all motion captured from the best tap dancer in the world at the time, [Savion Glover]( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iVd7xfdzmfg). - The dancers went through "Penguin School" to learn how to move like a penguin, and also wore head apparatus to mimic a penguin's beak. **Release:** - The film was originally announced to also be released in IMAX 3D, but it was later dropped, as it would have used up a lot of the budget. There are a few scenes where it's noticeable that it was originally to be in 3D, however. The 3D effect was present in the second film, most likely due to the revive of the format. - The sixth animated film to be the winner of the academy award for Best Animated Feature after _Shrek_ (2001), _Spirited Away_ (2001) (with the english dub release being 2002), _Finding Nemo (2003)_, _The Incredibles_ (2004), and _Wallace  amp; Gromit: The Curse of the Were-Rabbit_ (2005). **Trivia:** - Unlike Mumble, Elijah Wood is actually a pretty decent singer  #8212; as is E.G. Daily, the voice of young Mumble, who is a professional singer. - In 2011, an emperor penguin was found on a Peka Peka beach, on New Zealand northwest coast. The public was quick to dub the lost bird "Happy Feet Jr."Like his namesake, the bird was taken in by Wellington Zoo, rehabilitated, and released back into the wild affixed with a satellite tracking device. - According to Miller, the environmental message was not a major part of the original script, but ["In Australia, we're very, very aware of the ozone hole, #8221; he said,  #8220;and Antarctica is literally the canary in the coal mine for this stuff. So it sort of had to go in that direction. #8221; This influence led to a film with a more environmental tone. Miller said, "You can't tell a story about Antarctica and the penguins without giving that dimension. #8221;]( https://www.wsj.com/public/article/SB116373257478225933-QS7Oc7yiEQI503rfJ2N42OUiVH8_20071119.html) - The film was dedicated to the memory of [Nick Enright]( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nick_Enright), Michael Jonson, Robby McNeilly Green, and Steve Irwin. **Analysis:** - Whatever your opinion of this film is, one thing you cannot say is that it is  #8220;bland #8221;. - When you look at the numerous films and TV shows that have gotten stage musicals (How the hell is there a musical adaptation of _Groundhog Day_????), it is kind of shocking that this film hasn #8217;t gotten one.</TEXT>

    <TITLE>Great Twitter Thread on "My Neighbor Totoro"  amp; Western Animated Films</TITLE>
    <DATE>2020-05-08 20:01:09</DATE>
    <TEXT>So we're going to be discussing animated films for a while on this sub, so I thought I'd post a [Twitter thread](https://twitter.com/tonkohouse/status/1238663349962829825) I've been thinking about for a while. It comes from an indie animation studio in California, with one of the co-founders being from Japan:  gt;_1-Question to animation industry. We all praise films like Totoro as a master piece, and yet, western animation industry has this religious rule,  #8220;every scene must move the protagonists journey forward #8220; but is it true? Am I the only one who wants more diversity in storytelling?_  gt;_2-I #8217;m seeing my 8 year old #8217;s complete engagement watching Totoro as I write this. [Scenes like this](https://66.media.tumblr.com/6b41b6182e6edbb0663a9ccefd2e4d4a/tumblr_mjlikySpWR1s4h45mo1_500.gifv) would never survive in the western animated story development. Is it true that majority of kids worldwide don #8217;t respond to a scene like this? My son seems to disagree._  gt;_3-don #8217;t get me wrong. I love and appreciate the clean structure storytelling. Love all those story structure books and my education is from Pixar! I just hope there are more diversity in storytelling and wanted to hear what people thought._</TEXT>

    <TITLE>Some Facts, Trivia  amp; Analysis for "Happy Feet Two"</TITLE>
    <DATE>2020-05-12 11:31:17</DATE>
    <TEXT>Couldn #8217;t find much on the development of this film. [Home release special features aren #8217;t much help either](https://www.blu-ray.com/movies/Happy-Feet-Two-Blu-ray/35011/#Review). Let me know if you got something. **Casting:** - P!nk is the new voice of Gloria in the sequel due to Brittany Murphy's passing of pneumonia in December 2009. - Common replaces Fat Joe as Seymour in the sequel. **Release:** - The film was a box office bomb. Budget, $135 million. Box office, $64,006,466 (domestic), $150,406,466 (worldwide). This lost Warner $40 million, but in retrospect, the film bombing may have been in both Warner and Miller's best interests, as that led to Miller returning to action by finally completing Mad Max: Fury Road, which was a major accomplishment for his career. The same can #8217;t be said for everyone, as the rather poor reception led to Miller's Dr D Studios closing. - The box office failure of _Happy Feet Two_ and the lack of new ideas has put the film series on hiatus. Even George Miller isn't sure how he's going to pull off a third film. Crucial co-star Robin Williams taking his own life several years later made the outcome of a third film even more uncertain. **Trivia:** - In an interview, when asked about a 3rd _Happy Feet_, Miller said, "If you put a gun to my head and said, 'You have to come up with a story for _Happy Feet Three_,' I #8217;d say shoot me." **Analysis:** - I find it interesting that they chose to spell out the  #8220;2 #8221; in the film title. It just happens so rarely with these types of films. - As if they couldn #8217;t make the gay subtext with the grill more obvious with Bill singing songs written by gay dudes. - Having finally watched this film, I can confidently say I prefer this over the _Trolls_ films, 100%. - That  #8220;Dragonstea Din Tei #8221; number took me all the way to 2004. ([Did you know one of the singers made a sequel?](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jKcBZlPHC3o)) - These past two weeks I #8217;ve heard the word  #8220;weird #8221; over and over again from people in discussion of the  #8220;Happy Feet #8221; films, and call I can say is that [you all wouldn #8217;t know  #8220;weird #8221; if it punted you all the way to Antartica.](https://letterboxd.com/sathurawanderer/list/366-weird-movies-the-canon-original-list/)</TEXT>

    <TITLE>Facts About  amp; Analysis for "Bewitched" (2005)</TITLE>
    <DATE>2020-07-10 22:03:46</DATE>
    <TEXT>What the title says.  #8203; **Development:** * Like the 2009 film *Speed Racer,* this is another film based off a TV show that people in Hollywood were trying to get made since the 90s. * First, [Penny Marshall](https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/PennyMarshall) was attached to direct it and produce it in 1993, and her cast was to include [Meryl Streep](https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/MerylStreep) as Samantha Stephens, Barry Humphries in his Dame Edna persona as Endora, [Robin Williams](https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/RobinWilliams) as Uncle Arthur, [Shelley Winters](https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/ShelleyWinters) as Gladys Kravitz, and [Jerry Seinfeld](https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/JerrySeinfeld) *and* [Billy Crystal](https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/BillyCrystal) alternating scenes as Darrin Stephens, in a nod to the role being re-cast midway through the original series' run. **Production:** * The movie was originally planned as a traditional television-to-movie adaptation, directed by [Ted Bessell](https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0078783) (Donald on [That Girl](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0060034) (1966)). The movie property was in pre-production with producer and director [Penny Marshall](https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0001508)'s team at Paramount Pictures in the mid 1990s. Marshall first hired former [Laverne  amp; Shirley](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0074016) (1976) staff writer [Monica Johnson](https://www.imdb.com/name/nm1189787) to come up with a script. Eventually, [Richard Curtis](https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0193485) ([Four Weddings and a Funeral](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0109831) (1994)) took a crack at the story, as did Broadway playwright [Douglas Carter Beane](https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0063819). His 1996 stage reading cast [Melanie Griffith](https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000429) as Samantha, and was supposed to be a vehicle to revive Griffith's career. After the sudden and unexpected death of Mr. Bessell from an aortic aneurysm on October 6, 1996, all Bewitched theatrical movie plans were halted until [Penny Marshall](https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0001508) teamed with producers [Lucy Fisher](https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0279651) and [Douglas Wick](https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0926824)'s Red Wagon Entertainment at Sony and Columbia Pictures. **Casting:** * [Kristin Chenoweth](https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/KristinChenoweth)'s casting was suggested by [Nicole Kidman](https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/NicoleKidman), because Kidman very much enjoyed her performance as Glinda in the Broadway musical [*Wicked*](https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Theatre/Wicked). As a result, her part was written specifically for her. * In turn, it was Kristin Chenoweth's recommendation that the role of Aunt Clara was given to Carole Shelley, as she was her co-star in *Wicked*. * Joan Plowright was originally announced as Aunt Clara, but had to pull out before being shooting began. As mentioned elsewhere, the role was given to Carole Shelley at Kristin Chenoweth's recommendation. * [Mike Myers](https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/MikeMyers) was the producers' top choice for the role of Jack Wyatt/Darrin Stephens. [Jim Carrey](https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/JimCarrey) was approached, but had to decline because of other commitments. As [he resembles](https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SeparatedAtBirthCasting) [Dick York](https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/DickYork), he was a long-time common fan casting for the role on a *Bewitched* film. * Before [Nicole Kidman](https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/NicoleKidman) was cast as Samantha, several actresses, including [Jennifer Love Hewitt](https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/JenniferLoveHewitt) and [Jenny McCarthy](https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/JennyMcCarthy) (who at the time was married to John Mallory Asher, the adopted son of *Bewitched* series producer William Asher) were considered for the role. **Release:** * Budget, $85 million. Box office, $63,313,159 (domestic), $131,426,169 (worldwide). In short, this film was a box office bomb. * Writer Delia Ephron's career also vanished, and her sister Nora's directing career would disappear for another four years before she directed what became her final film, [*Julie  amp; Julia*](https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/JulieAndJulia). **Trivia:** * The Bewitched TVtheme heard about halfway through this movie, complete with lyrics, sounds like Frank Sinatra, but it was actually a 1964 recording done by Steve Lawrence, who was known for his uncanny impersonation of Sinatra. * The house that Isabel rents was chosen by writer and director [Nora Ephron](https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0001188) because it had belonged to friends of her parents, and she visited it many times as a child. By pure coincidence, those friends were Larry Berns and his wife, [Sandra Gould](https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0332490), who played the second, better-known Gladys Kravitz. [Alice Pearce](https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0668879), the first Gladys Kravitz, died after the second season, and was replaced with Gould. Ephron claims in the DVD commentary that she didn't realize this until after the movie was made. * This is the second time Nicole Kidman has played a witch. The first time was [Practical Magic](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0120791) (1998). * Hanging on a mirror in Isabel Bigelow's dressing room is a picture of the late [Elizabeth Montgomery](https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000548), the original Samantha Stephens from [Bewitched](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0057733) (1964). * This was the first Nicole Kidman movie that Kidman herself made her two youngest daughters see. Due to their young ages, the two girls believed their mother was able to perform magic tricks. They were left confused and disappointed when they realized the truth. * 4 years later, Will Ferrell would star in [another film based on an American TV show from the boomer generation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Land_of_the_Lost_(film)). * For the Spanish version, where inserts of the original television series appear, the sound heard is from the original Spanish dubbing that was done in Mexico during the 1970s. * Some deleted and alternate footage appears in the movie's trailer: * In Bed Bath  amp; Beyond, there's an exchange between Nigel and Isabel, in which he says, "But you're a witch." To which she replies, "I know, but I'm not gonna be one anymore." * Footage of Jack in an arctic movie is displayed full screen, not within a television set like in the movie. * Footage of the new animated *Bewitched* opening credits are shown on a television set, not full screen like in the movie. * The dialogue between Jack and Isabel outside of the caf #233; is different. While in the movie Jack says "Just come and show everybody what you look like when you do it", the trailer features a different line, including an interruption by Isabel: * **Jack:** Just come and show everybody what you look like when you... **Isabel:** What? **Jack:** ...wiggle your nose. * There's some extra shots during the Bed Bath  amp; Beyond checkout scene: Isabel's hand in her shopping cart, then a close-up of the credit card swiping machine while the cashier pushes a button on the cash register in the background to bring up the total displayed on the machine. **Facts about the original show this film is based on:** * The reason Samantha wiggled her nose to cast spells is that [Elizabeth Montgomery](https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/ElizabethMontgomery) had the very rare ability to wiggle her nose (or rather wiggle her upper lip). Reportedly it was actually something of a tic of hers; her husband and series producer William Asher noticed it and suggested it to be adapted to her character. * It is said that this show helped influence [Sally the Witch](https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/SallyTheWitch), which is the 1st Magical Girl manga and anime. * [David White](https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/DavidWhite) (one of the cast members; Larry Tate) directed an episode (the sixth season episode, "Samantha's Double Mother Trouble"). * Kasey Rogers, the second actress to portray Louise Tate, dyed her naturally red hair dark to more closely resemble the previous actress Irene Vernon. Rogers returned to red during the last few seasons. * [Paul Lynde](https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/PaulLynde) appeared in an early episode in a one-shot role that wasn't Uncle Arthur, however, he and Elizabeth Montgomery so loved working together, and the rest of the cast and crew got such a kick out of Paul Lynde and his sense of humor, that the character of Uncle Arthur was created pretty much to bring him back onto the show on a semi-regular basis... **My Personal Analysis:** * Even though it was tired and derivative at the point of its release, I feel this film would have fared better if it was like a *Josie and the Pussycats* or *Charlie's Angels* and was just goofy. * Wait....if this movie came out in the 2000s and is based on a show from the 60s, does this mean I'm going to see weird in-joke theatrical productions of shows from my childhood/generation like *Kenan  amp; Kel* and *Drake  amp; Josh* when I'm in my 40s???!!!..**...Oh God.....**</TEXT>

    <TEXT>**From the description:**  gt;_This uncut half-hour unsold TV pilot, as televised on network TV, was developed, written, and produced by SNL alums Conan O'Brien and Robert Smigel. The premise of this dry-humor half-hour show has Adam West playing a has-been actor, Ty Lookwell, of decades-past acclaim for starring in the TV detective drama, "Bannigan." The humor of this show lies with the aspects of Lookwell being so full-of-himself as an actor; where, despite his ineptness, he thinks he's a detective pro on par as his Bannigan character was._  gt;_The show also reminds TV viewers that the 1970s saw a proliferation of TV detective/crime dramas, as the dialogue in this show will bear-out_  gt;Supporting cast: Ron Frazier, Ann Weldon, Todd Fields, Bart Braverman, Deborah Richter, Brian Bradley, Jeff Austin, Chris Barnes, John Capodice, Molly Cleator, Brick Karnes, Sal Lopez, John Riggi, Steve Schubert  gt;Directed by E.

    <TEXT>**Description:** *The Old Guard is a pretty decent movie #8230;there, the end, no need to listen to the show! I suppose if you missed the dulcet tones of our voices, we #8217;ve got some tweaks that might be fun to consider. Gregg adds a new sentimental brotherly subplot, Scott sends Nile into the arms of the villains in the first act and Liam eliminates the TV pilot-esque stinger.* *Special thanks to Deja for providing research on this film for us. He dug up all sorts of great tidbits including the fact that the post-production team was made up of 85% women. This is especially impressive considering among the top-grossing films in 2019 only 6% of VFX supervisors were women and just 25% were editors. Even if you weren #8217;t over the moon about the movie, this is definitely refreshing in a frustratingly male dominated industry.*</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Comment I posted:  gt;*Great review! If there #8217;s one thing I like about  #8221;Infinity Train #8221; as a whole, it #8217;s how the train itself has parallels to our imperfect society.*  gt;  gt;  gt;  gt;*When Tulip first gets on the train, the intention of it is being halted by someone who took over with their own personal agenda. Even when One-One is restored as the true conductor, the damage had been done. A large group of people have been caused to believe in actions that are unethical to the train and themselves, and Amelia is busy off trying to fix every train she changed. Even if everything was fixed and the train was brought back to its original state, it would still be an unfair system, as  #8220;nulls #8221; who have free will like Mirror Tulip want to get off the train, even though it #8217;d be antithetical to her purpose.*  gt;  gt;  gt;  gt;*(Also, NO ONE should be watching this show at any point but the beginning. They won #8217;t appreciate the dimensions the show has otherwise)*</TEXT>

    <TITLE>Some Facts  amp; Analysis for "The Old Guard</TITLE>
    <DATE>2020-08-30 04:56:00</DATE>
    <TEXT>What it says on the tin.  #8203; **Development:** * [Greg Rucka](https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/GregRucka) wrote the first screenplay, but when [Charlize Theron](https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/CharlizeTheron) came aboard, she had a number of issues with it, which were raised in a conference call that he referred to as "one of the worst experiences of my career". He did a rewrite, but was fired, describing the process as "frustrating, but that's Hollywood". Theron's production company commissioned a screenplay rewrite from two new writers, but [Netflix](https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/Netflix) and Skydance hated *that* version, and director Gina Prince-Bythewood reached out to Rucka for help as filming began. Eventually, Netflix and Skydance fired the other two, then hired Rucka back to rewrite the rewrite of his rewrite, and he was on set for most of the filming. During this time he and Theron got to know each other better, and were able to work out their previous differences when she realized he "wasn't acting like a standard prima donna writer, complaining about someone ruining their story". In particular, she raised the issue that one scene was too reminiscent of the stairway fight from [*Atomic Blonde*](https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/AtomicBlonde) (in which she sustained several injuries), and when Rucka not only agreed with her but wrote a new scene overnight, any reservations she had about him vanished. * The film was partly inspired by the book *On Killing: The Psychological Cost of Learning to Kill in War and Society* by Dave Grossman. He himself is a controversial figure in regards how he trains police officers to kill, [as seen in this Some More News video](https://youtu.be/tuzQrbio2Qw?t=366). **Casting:** * Matthias Schoenaerts, who is Belgian, plays Booker, who is French. **Reception:** **Trivia:** * The original comic and original and final rewrites of the screenplay were written by [Greg Rucka](https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/GregRucka). * In the Italian and German versions, Luca Marinelli (Nicky) dubs himself. However in the French version with Booker, who is voiced by Boris Rehlinger even though Matthias Schoenaerts speaks French and has dubbed himself into French before. * The characters Andy, Joe and Nicky are from nations that no longer exist ( Scythia, an unknown state in the Maghreb, and the Republic of Genoa respectively). They technically can't share national origins with their actors, but Joe and Nicky are still played by actors from their states' modern-day successors, Tunisian-Dutch Marwan Kenzari and Italian Luca Marinelli. In contrast, Andy is from what is now Eastern Europe or Central Asia (though, given that she's much older than Scythian culture, her true origins could be elsewhere) but is played by American-South African Charlize Theron. **Analysis:** * The entire time watching this film, I kept thinking of [this Robot Chicken skit](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SlWegS2sS0). * The podcasts [*Podside Picnic*](https://soundcloud.com/user-733327042/episode-73-the-old-guard) and [*Kino Lefte*r](https://www.buzzsprout.com/226175/4851488-86-the-old-guard-netflix-queers-killology) had an interesting discussion on this film.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>From the article:  gt; **Hayes III** Isaac Hayes did not quit South Park; someone quit _South Park_ for him. What happened was that in January 2006 my dad had a stroke and lost the ability to speak. He really didn't have that much comprehension, and he had to relearn to play the piano and a lot of different things. He was in no position to resign under his own knowledge. At the time, everybody around my father was involved in Scientology  #8212; his assistants, the core group of people. So someone quit South Park on Isaac Hayes' behalf. We don't know who. Honestly reading that makes [this scene a lot more real.](https://youtu.be/vVdwTD6s60I)</TEXT>
