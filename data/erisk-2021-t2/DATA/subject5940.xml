It's not only believing what you see in porn is normal. It's not only hormones. It's not only your upbringing. It's a cocktail of all of them. Or maybe you're just a sex addict. Who knows for sure. Maybe a buddy said I'll give you 50 bucks to says that.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Hmm. I see. It sounds like the 2 of you'll aren't communicating enough. Like the lingerie. You feel good in a certain one, but he thinks you look sexier in the other, or simply has a kink for it. Have you told him you feel sexier in the one you chose and that's why you like it? Has he told you why he prefers the other? Sometimes all you need to do is ask the other person why they prefer a over b before it becomes a disagreement. Both of you'll need to understand the others choices. Pouting beacuse you didn't get your way sounds like a spoilt kid. Giving in all the time will make you resent him. Edit: Try to ensure when asking why, it's known you want to understand, and you aren't just questioning your partner. Or they can feel like they're being interrogated. Edit 2. I see you did try telling him it makes you feel unattractive and then he said let's just go. Maybe still try asking why he only prefers his choice. Also tell him, if you're wearing lingerie you feel sexy in, the sexy time will be much better for both of you'll. If you aren't feeling your sexiest you can't perform your best. I don't know what other stuff you'll disagree you'll but I think you need to try and make sure he understands how his choices affect you.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Have you considered South Africa? If you have dollars saved up you could probably buy at least half your home cash. Also we have an AWS branch, if you could transfer with your salary, you would be living like a king. The AWS branch is in Cape Town. Cape Town is one of the most relaxed cities in South Africa, and has a great night life, if that is your thing. Your wife may have to consider becoming a lecturer at a university, that is unless she could work for a mining company? I don't know what exactly a Geophysicist does. Edit: Something I forgot to mention, 1 USD = 13.48 ZAR, a great home will cost you 1000000ZAR which is roughly 75000 USD.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Most definitely not South African culture. We have tons of Bills and Toms. I may used the wrong word, as it's amongst Muslim's where the meaning of your name is very important. In fact if you find out your name has a 'bad' meaning, you should change your name. In India there are too many religions and beliefs to have a common culture. Hope this clears things up.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Alot of people here are going to say that white people are feigning ignorance so they can't be blamed. I am of Indian descent, born in 1986. I was only allowed in a model c school in grade 1. My preschool class was the girls change room of the 'Indian' school, beacuse there wasn't enough funds to build another class. We only went to certain beaches, we only went to certain shopping centres. Yet I didn't realise apartheid existed. My parents tried to give me the most normal life they could at the time. So I fully believe many white people only realised and learnt of apartheid much later in life.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Sorry, I guess I posed the question incorrectly. I was thinking more along the lines of getting rid of compound interest. So if I person ran into some issues, and couldn't make payments, they would still only be liable to pay back 1100, not 1100 plus interest, plus interest, plus interest. Obviously if they didn't make any payments, the bank would take their collateral or further steps.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Try the counting down. I've found that really helps me out as well. I too have a motivation issue with praying salah. For me it's about not having a reason to pray, once I found my reason to pray it just got easier and easier. It gets to a point where you enjoy praying and look forward to it. I have had off periods, where I wouldn't read any except jumma, but maybe try spending some time and thinking about what your reason is to pray.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>When my son was born I would put on the original star wars series while we up in the middle of the night feeding him or when he needed to burp etc. It just helped having something to distract us when you should be grumpy and annoyed. My wife hates any movie with aliens, so I would just watch some until I fell asleep and she wouldn't bother watching. One day I passed out while watching, when I woke up I went to turn off the TV and she said, "Stop, I want to see what happens." That's when I realised she was hooked on this "space movie" made in the 80s. It more a silly memory but knowing that she actually enjoyed it was what stuck with me. Now my mini me is older, he's watching Beast Wars and loved the space fights from rogue one. EDIT: [I done forgot my steam ID](https://steamcommunity.com/id/Moe786_ZN)</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I wonder if it's possible to extract it? Edit: So according to [this study](https://www.swarthmore.edu/news-events/two-biochemistry-majors-ask-how-much-cocaine-your-wallet) you get between 0 and 25 micrograms per bill, with an exception of 125. So on average we'll take 20 micrograms (I'm being optimistic, or pessimistic). From a million bills you'd be able to extract 20 grams of coke. Not sure if the methanol would destroy the money though.</TEXT>

    <TEXT> gt;There is also a slight change in the withdrawal fee when withdrawing to any Bitcoin wallet from NiceHash wallet. If you are withdrawing between 0.0105 BTC (min withdraw amount) and 0.2 BTC, you are subjected to 0.001 BTC fee (previously 0.0005 BTC). All other conditions remain the same. How does this affect withdrawing to coinbase?</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Thanks for your answer. They need to allow us to transfer our external wallet balance, and balance that was stolen into nicehash wallet. This is getting ridiculous. Now the external wallet payout threshold is at 0.1 BTC. Lots of us started mining on external wallets when they 'returned' and now we're stuck.</TEXT>

Individual people leaving, but add up the numbers and see if they can still make their hashrates for the buyers. They are failing to understand, without the miners, they have no business.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Hi All Has anyone had any success with mining using a Radeon HD 7600M. I have a laptop that is doing nothing, so I figured I'd put it to some use. I have managed mining Monero's using the CPU and integrated Intel HD 4000, but can't get the AMD HD 7600M to pick up. Anyone have any ideas of what I can do to try and mine using the AMD GPU? Thanks in advance.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>It was the 25th of June. I was awakened by the sound of trash cans being tossed, as well as blaring sirens. The rank smell of burning rubber permeated the air. I jumped out of bed and grabbed my panic alarm. My twin brother had given it to me, after the 3rd time we were confused with each other. You see, he was now the ruler of Best Korea. Nobody in Best Korea found it odd to see a large black man ruling a county of diminutive asians. After all, he had fallen from the sky to rule them as a God amongst men. My brother had learnt to wipe memories as well as implant them. I hadn't taken much effort into mastering my skill. Wiping the memory of movies was more than enough for me. Besides, it pays the bills for this Manhattan loft, and my Netflix. After swallowing my panic, I slowly shuffled to the window to see what's going on, but my heart leaped back into my throat as I heard a heavy handed rap on the door. I looked through the peephole, but all I saw was a green glow. I could barely make out a hooded figure, but nothing made sense at this late hour. I still don't know why I did it, but I opened the door. There stood a 6 foot man in a hooded brown robe, holding a green lightsaber. Behind him was a long line of people snaking down the stairs. Some dressed as wookies, some as storm troopers. I even saw a tiny kid in a droid suit. The hooded man silently shoved a few hundred dollar bills into my hand, and then he uttered three words which still shakes me to my core.............. "Jar Jar Binks" EDIT: Spelling :(</TEXT>

Prohashing is a great idea if you're hodling altcoins, but make sure you have secondary pools setup. Never used miningpoolhub. I was making more $ per day at nicehash than prohashing though. So depends if you mining long game or cash outs.</TEXT>

    <TEXT> gt; 1) ZOTAC was founded in 2006. We would like to know your thoughts on what ZOTAC means to you. Also, when and how did you first hear about ZOTAC?  #160;  gt; I haven't owned a Zotac card, but they seem to be in demand amongst gamers, so kudos on that. I first heard about Zotac last year, when my brother bought a small Zotac 1070 card.  gt; 2) As the customer, what kind of company would you like ZOTAC to be for you? How can we make welcome you into our ZOTAC hardware family?  #160;  gt; In all honesty Zotac cards are very bland in appearance, when you're building a monster, you want something that works well and looks great also. A little RGB, some more yellows.  gt; 3) ZOTAC being the industry leader in Mini PCs, would it be more likely for you to purchase a ZOTAC Mini PC if it were modular/customizable? Why choose a traditional full-tower build opposed to a Mini PC? In your opinion, what are the Pros and Cons?  gt;I would absolutely buy a modular mini PC as I would be using it with my TV. My needs for a GPU aren't as high as someone that may be using it for streaming, or as their LAN machine. Being modular would mean I could buy a "Cheaper" mini PC with a 1060 and 16GB RAM, as opposed to someone who needs a 1080 and 32gb RAM. As a father of 2, time to game is few and far between. I want something that I can just chill on the couch and maybe get the rest of the fam involved with, hence my requirements aren't as high. Being modular I could always upgrade the GPU if I ended up with a 4k/8k tv, wouldn't need to buy a new system, and I could sell the older GPU. Full size systems are required if you need dual GPU's and are in need of every bit of performance you can get. The cons of a mini pc is always going to be airflow/cooling and upgradability. Because of the cooling limitations, you need more powerful fans, which mean more noise. In a small factor you're likely limited to 1 GPU and 2 Ram sticks. Upgrade choices are also more limited on a small factor as opposed to full factor. All in all, Mini PC's are the way to go for me, not everyone, but I'm a fan.... fam ;). Bonus question.... Pineapples are yellow, Zotac is yellow, thus pineapples must be awesome, even on pizza's.</TEXT>

    <TEXT> gt;I have a question about South Africa. On  gt;  gt;r/askreddit  gt;  gt;I recently saw some people from that country talking about how unsafe it was and how they never want to go back(they were mostly expats). They mentioned things like theft being inevitable and it being normal to see someone being murdered. I suspect though that those people might just be exaggerating because they are upset with the post-apartheid order. Can you give your take on the situation in South Africa so I can get a better understanding of how things are there on the ground? Soo, my cousin was murdered in front of his kids and wife, he wasn't rich and had nothing to steal (pre-common-cellphone days). He was just walking home from his parents house down the road. My first cousins' cousin was murdered after he let out the people who robbed him. They just turned around and shot him. My aunt was held up on their farm and shot at, after they took whatever they want. My sisters car was stolen. Our family car was stolen from the Mosque.  #8203; I live in Johannesburg and you hear about people being affected by crime so often you become numb to it. A former colleague was using public transport to come to work, and he was mugged 3 times in 2 years. Another colleague was mugged last year using public transport. My domestic worker was mugged, and a previous domestic worker was almost raped. So, yes there is too much senseless violence.  #8203; It stems from a corrupt government who is more interested in driving the latest Mercedes than helping their fellow brother/sister who is living in a shack. (Please google squatter camps in South Africa)  #8203; I'd safely bet that I don't know someone who doesn't know someone who was robbed or killed.  #8203; Edit, please note these stories span 20 + years of my life.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>For me it has to be Skyrim. I had just bought a gtx560 after working literally 18-22 hour shifts. Major project at work. I started up the game and thought 'Wow, these graphics are amazing". And then the dragon shows up. I lost my shit. I played the heck out of that game. Sadly my 560 died and I was without a gaming pc for 5 years. I am now lucky enough to have a GTX 1060 and would love to replay the special edition to try and recreate those memories.. That's my story and I hope the money you won brings you nothing but joy and more money. Almost forgot about favourite animal. Snow Leopard. That coat is that beautiful and looks like it's so fluffy I could die.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I started this game last week. I have a very stressful job and once I put my kids to bed I look forward to putting in an hour or 2 into this game. I wouldn't say it has a sense of progression as such, but watching your Ranch grow and 'discovering' new slime types and figuring out how to keep them is really cool. I'd say the game is more therapeutic than fun. But it is really fun.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I got the game 2 weeks ago on Android. (Already so tempted to get it on PC) Here is the thing, I love the game. I play it every night before bed and it's so chilled while still being so addictive. I have now hit winter and ..... I realized that I am enjoying the game about twice as much now that I don't have crops to tend to. It made me realize that the crop farming part feels like a chore, to me. I cannot wait to build Iridium sprinklers as I need to have that steady income. But dang-it I wish I could employ someone to help on the farm, with the menial tasks.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Hey, thanks for the advice. I got me a big barn, and a big Coop, I do enjoy checking up on the buggers. Now with the auto-collector for my Cows and Goats it's such a pleasure to just go say Hi to them and give them hay. I want to start breeding chickens and ducks so I took that specialization which cuts down the incubation period. I've also let my grass grow wild, so they have enough to eat when spring comes. I have a few tappers, and I've started a forest on the left of where the greenhouse will be. will definitely need to put out more tappers. I held back on more tappers due to ore constraints. I only just reached the 20s in the mine and got the quarry, so now I have much more ores. Once again, I appreciate the advice.  #8203; Edit: spelling</TEXT>

    <TEXT>People use the 'logic' that we are in a multiverse, and there are billions of other universes where the big bang went wrong. They believe that every single co-incedence of co-incedence's happened to bring us to this moment right now. To bring life to this rock. To bring water to it. To have it in the goldilocks zone. To have the perfect atmostphere. That every single miniscule scenario that happened to bring us to right here and right now, was a pure co-incedence. I choose to look at it and see the wonder of possibilty. The possibilty that there is a God. That the God I choose to believe in, is the one true God. That everything that happened was in my benefit, that everything that didn't happen was in my benefit. And to just be grateful that I have what I have right now. The more you look at the universe and the earth, the harder it is not to believe. But thats just me. May Allah bless all of us with steadfast Iman.</TEXT>
