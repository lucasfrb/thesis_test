    <TEXT>The battle for No 1 Poultry began in 1958, when Lord Palumbo's late father, Rudolph, bought the first freehold of the site. He spent the next 25 years acquiring 12 other freeholds and 345 leaseholds to form a wedge-shaped site for redevelopment. It was Lord Palumbo himself who commissioned the German-born Modernist Mies van der Rohe to design a skyscraper for the site. It, too, incurred the Prince of Wales's wrath - he described it as 'a glass stump more suited to downtown Chicago'.</TEXT>

    <TITLE>Can anyone help me answer the disirder My Girlfriends eating situation is? (21F and 18M)</TITLE>
    <DATE>2020-08-30 04:14:42</DATE>
    <TEXT>So here's the story. Every weekend I spend time at my girlfriends apartment (Friday through to Sunday). We always spend the day playing video games, watching tv, doing mini photoshoots etc. But when we want to order food she always orders something small and not a big meal for the both of us. I dont mind this at all because I respect her decisions and usually i am too hungry and eat her meal when she is finished. For example today we had a 12" pepperoni pizza, we split it down the middle so we would get 4 slices each. She ate three, left the crusts (which I didn't mind at all) but when she went onto the fourth one she couldn't eat it. However, i ate 3 as well but left the 4th slice to respect her decision and not eat. Can anyone explain if this is a good or a bad thing. As i cannot figure out what kind of disorder she has. Sorry if it was a bit long. I just worry about her a lot and this is my first relationship and didnt want to seem rude by asking her up front. Thank you so much if you can help, and don't worry if you can't.</TEXT>

    <DATE>2020-09-25 00:14:26</DATE>
    <TEXT>So there has been 2020 years, and every 4th year is a leap year. So that would be (2020 #247;4) 505 leap years. Leaving us with a normal 1,515 years. The amount of days in a normal year is 365, There has been (365*1515) 552,975 days consecutive without a leap year happening. With a leap year the days are 366 (366*505) 184,830. Adding those together (552,975+184,830) 737,805 days in total, that's including the end of this year. If you multiply the amount of days with the money you get paid per day, that would equal (737,805*250,000) $184,451,250,000. Therefore being richer than Jeff Bezos whose Net worth is 175.3 #160;billion USD. You will be $9.1 Billion richer than Mr. Amazon. (Bit of useless information, but it is cool to know)</TEXT>
