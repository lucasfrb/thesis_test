    <TEXT>So I'm heading to Toronto in late September and was wondering if anyone, by chance, knows where the filming locations of Suits are. I am a HUGE fan of the show from Australia and travelling across the globe and then being given the opportunity to see this being filmed would be great. I'm even in Manhattan in mid-September. So if any writers, producers and/or crew are reading this, what are the chances you can get me a behind the scenes peek?</TEXT>

    <TITLE>Woodbury Common and New York clothing</TITLE>
    <DATE>2013-05-30 02:23:00</DATE>
    <TEXT>So I'm heading to New York for the first time ever from Australia in September and was wondering where people's suggestions for good clothing bargains were in the concrete jungle, New York City. I am already planning to go to Woodbury Common but was wondering, is it really that much cheaper there or are there still decent bargains in Manhattan? I know Levi's are much cheaper in the US but is it worth me not buying them here when they go on sale in Australia for $60 for say a trucker jacket (price comparison) I know in Manhattan there's Uniqlo but what other places are a must see for male fashion in NYC that are a decent price. Obviously I can't buy and bring everything back so I'm looking to see what I should add to my list. Websites would be helpful. In short: What are some decent sale prices at Woodbury Common for price comparison to Australian retail? What clothes should I put off purchasing in Australia as they are much cheaper in NYC?</TEXT>

    <TITLE>Diana Mini - skipping frames help!</TITLE>
    <DATE>2014-03-12 01:24:48</DATE>
    <TEXT>Hi all. First of all please bear with me as I was only recently gifted a Diana Mini for Christmas. I've done copious amounts of research and was all ready to go, but after three rolls of developed film I think there is a problem with my camera. I've loaded it correctly, ensured everything is okay and taken photos as well as I can in good lighting conditions. I wouldn't mind if they turned out blurry but it seems like they're not turning out at all.. it's skipping frames. Out of a 36 exposure film I'll get about 11 decent shots, if I'm lucky. Is this a know problem with the Diana Mini and if so what is the solution? I couldn't find any information anywhere apart from a previous discussion on Flickr in 2011 and an Amazon purchaser's review. Please help as I don't want to not use the camera. It seems so good and has potential.</TEXT>

I initially trialled Pinnacle Studios as per GoPros suggestion on their website but found that I could not get to edit/preview/render in real time so I trialled Adobe Premiere. Then it worked. After long periods the timeline preview started to get choppy but it definitely rendered properly again after a quick pause. Much better than Pinnacle Studios. What is the GoPro communitys go to editing software? Do people still convert from CineForm first and then import it to their editing program? What is the best export settings for Youtube and/or home viewing?</TEXT>

    <TEXT>GoPro people of Reddit, who of you have a DJI Phantom for your GoPro and do you think it is actually worth the price you paid for it? I am seriously considering biting the bullet and purchasing one but the price just seems so steep. Even possibly the Phantom 1. What are the main differences between the models? Finally, more importantly, are they used for any other function apart from aerial shots?</TEXT>

    <TEXT>As above, does having a cold affect the chances of conception. So my partner is 11 DPO today but she has developed a cold in the past couple of days. Hasn't taken any medication though. I'm sorry for being of the opposite sex and asking, but it's been about 5 months and still no success for us and each month it gets harder and harder. Still fighting the urge for her to do a pregnancy test because I find that if AF arrives first I'm less disappointed than a BFN.</TEXT>

My partner told me this morning as she was getting ready that she doesn't feel pregnant and is starting to get acne again. I braved a strong face and played ignorant and smiled. But I've been through this before and I know it's a sign of impending AF. She's currently 12 dpo but we're trying to avoid tests because anything but AF gets us upset while we wait. I just needed to vent, and I might as well throw a question out there, is acne a sign we are out totally?</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I was wondering what Reddit's general consensus was with Port Noarlunga for snorkeling. My partner and I aren't looking to become professionals or anything but we would like to get more comfortable with the beach and some diving and was wondering if this is actually a beginner place like I've heard it is. When driving past the other day we noticed some rocks towards the end of the jetty which seemed to separate the rough part of the ocean with the more calmer part, which side of that is where most of the snorkeling can be done? What about marine life i.e. jellyfish and sharks? I noticed some people also canoe there, would we be getting in their way? I hope I don't sound too ridiculous with my questions but I hope Reddit will pull through and give me more realistic replies than the generic web searches do.</TEXT>

    <TITLE>Air cinditioner technicians in Adelaide (NE area)</TITLE>
    <DATE>2015-01-07 23:07:35</DATE>
    <TEXT>Fellow Redditors I need your help. From what seemed to be working fine one minute (new when we moved in in 2009), our Panasonic revere cycle split air-conditioner now seems to not be cooling like it once was. It still cools but it just doesn #8217;t seem to be as cold as before. Does anyone know a reputable technician and/or company which is able to have a look at it. Some quick Google and asking around suggested it may need regassing, but do split system air conditioners need to be regassed? Also, in April last year we had a gas hot water system break down on us and because of this we found a gas leak and needed to have new gas pipes installed. This may seem like a random question, but would the installation of the new gas pipes affect the air conditioner, or is that gas5 separate to the gas used by air conditioners? Please excuse me for being na #239;ve. I know it #8217;s near impossible to find a place with no call out fees but since this is all new to me I was hoping Reddit would provide me with some decent suggestions/direction/technicians for not getting ripped off (hopefully someone who can come around and have a talk to me about it in the Paradise area)</TEXT>

    <DATE>2015-01-07 23:14:07</DATE>
    <TEXT>I love my GoPro videography, but lately I seem to have stumbled upon this hidden gem which hasn #8217;t seemed to reach the GoPro masses: Feiyu G4 3-axis gimbal This accessory seems to be great and give great stable hand held videos but I #8217;m just wondering why it hasn #8217;t been mentioned as much before on /r/GoPro Even the GoPro/videographer reviewer greats like MicBergsma, Casey Neistat and DanJacobs haven #8217;t mentioned this gimbal before. The G3 versions of the accessory seems to have been out for about a year now but there wasn #8217;t that much publicity about it, unlike the DJI Phantoms and etc. What do people think of the Feiyu G4 3-axis gimbal. Is it over priced and that #8217;s why a lot of people don #8217;t have them? Are analog stabilizers still a better option? I know that they aren #8217;t really widely available here in Australia. And it seems like they released a new version fairly quickly after the G3 Ultra version (almost like 6 months or so) I would love to get your opinions and thoughts on this gimbal. Open discussion welcome.</TEXT>

    <DATE>2015-03-10 22:40:18</DATE>
    <TEXT>The one thing which I admire about apple is the software, and as always, Google will eventually catch up, but it #8217;ll take some time. I like the fact the Apple Watch has native apps. This is definitely where it will excel to begin with. Put the watch up against speakers to Shazam the song. Browse Instagram and double tap to like a photo (I #8217;m aware of Insta for Android, but to me it #8217;s just not well developed), Browse contacts and  #8220;buzz #8221; them. Apps are where it will begin and make it easier for users to transition into using an Apple Watch. I don #8217;t need NFC. That #8217;s a feature which still hasn #8217;t really been utilized in everyday situations and will still need to grow for it to be fundamental, and by that time most will have upgraded their Android Wear. Remember, most people didn #8217;t have a smartphone to begin with either. I also don #8217;t need a speaker. Don #8217;t get me wrong, when I got my watch a couple of weeks ago, I thought I would, but to this day I don #8217;t feel comfortable talking to my watch to record notes in public, let alone make calls. And I don #8217;t think it would suffice as an alarm or be any good if all my items were ringing i.e. tablet, mobile phone, watch, pc, at the same time because I was using the one account (email or apple handoff comes to mind) That #8217;s just my opinion for now. Also, I found a messaging app called TicTalk (created by the same company that made Facer) last night which also buzzes people's Android Watch if they have one, but also seems messages if they don't, but it seems to have been pulled from the store for some reason.</TEXT>

    <TITLE>Fake Feiyu G4 3 Axis Gimbal?</TITLE>
    <DATE>2015-07-26 05:05:38</DATE>
    <TEXT>Hi fellow GoPro people. I was just wondering if there are fake Feiyu G4 gimbals around the place, or if they don't exist yet, and if there are, how do I go about spotting a fake? The reason I ask is because I have recently purchased a Feiyu G4 gimbal due to the great price from Banggood.com but have noticed they also sell a lot of stuff from China (i.e. fake), so I was hoping I didn't get duped into buying a fake. Here is the link http://www.banggood.com/Feiyu-Tech-FY-G4-3-Axis-Handheld-Steady-Camera-Gimbal-For-Gopro-4-3-p-958556.html Is there a way to tell the difference, or has anyone purchased one from banggood.com?</TEXT>

    <TEXT>As stated above, as much as I would love to build a PC for more power, due to the fact I travel, I believe a laptop would better suit my needs. Can anyone recommend a laptop which they believe would have more than enough processing power to edit GoPro videos smoothly. I know a lot of people would lean towards a Macbook Pro but I'm a PC enthusiast myself. And also, does a gaming laptop necessarily mean it would also be the best laptop for video editing? Or are there cheaper alternatives to a gaming laptop which would be sufficient? Brand and model would be great so I can start doing my GoPro research.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I shoot videos using a Canon 5D Mark II at 30fps and a GoPro Hero 4 Silver at 60fps. Usually, I then just interpret the GoPro footage to 30fps to get the smooth slow motion effect, but then how am I able to also use videos I shot with the 5D Mark II onto my 30fps timelime without having a mix of real time and slow motion footage? Is there anyway to smoothly slow down 5D Mark II footage so that it seamlessly blends with my GoPro footage? I hope I'm making sense, I'm new to all of this.</TEXT>

The best video I've been able to find is /u/DanJacobs video on setting up Adobe Premiere for editing, but nothing for exporting https://youtu.be/0eYHsoaVUvk Also, since GoPro splits long videos into parts what is the best way to join these videos and export them for archiving and future use?</TEXT>

I believe connecting it to a more powerful PC may speed up my rendering times. Is this practical or should I just bite the bullet and get a high performance laptop?</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Looking at getting a 50cc scooter. Now before we get into the debate of safety, I've read that some scooters have speed restrictions on them. Is it actually illegal to derestrict them in SA? What would the consequence be if it is illegal? i.e would any accident automatically become my fault? How does it work if the speedometer maxes out at 60 kph. If it's not illegal does any place derestrict them in SA? And since this is /r/Adelaide do locals think the commute from Campbelltown to the city be scooter safe enough? Apart from a couple of mild hills I can't think of any other obstacles (mostly flat roads) and the maximum road speed limit I would encounter is 60 kph.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I'm currently tossing up between an Instax Neo 90 and an Instax SP-1 printer. Those that have both a camera (any Instax camera model) and a printer, which one would you most suggest? Pros and Cons please. Note: The Instax Neo 90 is currently on sale for $129AU and I sort of like the idea that there's only ever one "original" copy.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Fellow MFA, I am travelling to SE Asia for two months and need to know what to pack so I can still look somewhat dapper, and be practical in the hot weather, at the same time. I'll have a decent sized suitcase, so I wouldn't say I'm backpacking, but would still like to try to travel light. What shoes should I consider bringing which become versatile enough? Boat shoes. Sneakers. Beeswax CDBs. I know you MFA gurus are out there. What makes a man travel light, with essentials, and still fit into /r/MaleFashionAdvice</TEXT>

Also, I don't think they x-ray checked luggage going out of Australia, only in, is that correct?</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Okay, so maybe my title is a little misleading. Maybe it's too much of an over reaction, but you do have to sometimes wonder if the rise of GoPro is slowly becoming the fall of GoPro. Step back a year or two ago and everyone couldn't wait to get their hands on a GoPro, whether their lives were exciting or not. The accessories like a handheld gimbal was next. But now, it seems to have plateaued. where are all the die hard GoPro fans? I know you;re still out there, but where are the new users? I think the innovation of GoPro has stopped. So prove me wrong. And speaking of innovation, where is the GoPro Karma. These guys are so late to the game now and I'm starting to think it might be too little too late. You have cameras to compete with, drone companies and now those drone companies are even building their own cameras.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Please be gentle as I'm new to all of this, but what is the general consensus for the DJI Phantom 3 4K with Integrated UHD 4K Stabilised Camera being a first drone? It's currently on sale for $799AU and I thought it would be decently priced. I know it doesn't have lightbridge, but is that a major factor to begin with? I would have preferred a drone that is able to use my GoPros but the 3DR Solo just seems over priced for what it is. Or does this sub recommend building one? ow much would it cost to build a drone able to equip a GoPro and view what the camera is filming? Wouldn't I need a dedicated app?</TEXT>

I might be showing my age but back in the 90s we used to have old school GMA satellite television and there used to be a music video that came on almost every hour. The lyrics were similar to "Til I saw in you" and "It came out of the blue" and I think it was by an artist by the name of Chua, Chua or De La Fuente. I'm so sorry I'm vague but it's all I got. The music video was basically just of her singing in one room? Maybe? It was about the same time Aegis were making it on the OPM scene.

    <TITLE>Stress cracks on GoPro Hero 4 Silver, any advice?</TITLE>
    <DATE>2016-10-17 22:47:57</DATE>
    <TEXT>So, for some unknown reason, I pulled my GoPro Hero 4 Silver from my Frame mount today to find that the silver faceplate had begun to crack just above the lens (top right corner). Never has the GoPro been dropped, bumped or even scratched as photo evidence would prove, as it's only ever attached to the Frame mount or Feiyutech gimbal. I suspect that the crack has begun appearing as the official GoPro frame is very tight around the camera, and having a look at it, applies a lot of pressure. And through time the silver faceplate, or front of the GoPro, will eventually tear away. People who have worked with GoPro's customer service, is this something worth taking up with GoPro Australia? Is there a possible fix or would customer service be willing to provide me with assistance or would I be wasting my time. The camera is out of warranty as it is a Hero 4 Silver, but I love my 4 Silver and at this stage the Hero 5 Black is not compatible with other purchased accessories.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>So I use a memory card reader to transfer my raw 1080p footage from my GoPro to my phone and then attempt to use GoPro Quik to quickly edit. The problem is, no matter which phone I use, the app struggles to process hmthe footage in real time smoothly. Does anyone else have this problem? Does it only work when you transfer lower quality video files via wifi? What model phone are you using?</TEXT>

    <TITLE>Scooter Parts in Adelaide</TITLE>
    <DATE>2016-11-08 11:43:03</DATE>
    <TEXT>So I only just realized this afternoon that the exhaust on my Honda Today 50cc scooter is literally just hanging off. For some reason two nuts have just fallen off (whether someone unscrewed them, I don't know) but I need to replace the nuts. Unlike cars, there isn't a scooter wreckers I can just go to so can anyone suggest where I get parts or even begin to enquire about this sort of stuff in Adelaide, preferably the North East, but not necessary. Really hoping someone can help.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>So, I posted before that I needed help with parts in holder to hold up the exhaust on my Honda Today 50cc scooter. I figured it would be much easier to describe with pictures (yes, it should have been provided earlier) http://imgur.com/a/1JwIW Anyway, with the wisdom or /r/Adelaide can someone tell me what part I should be calling around for here. My Google-Fu says I should be asking for an exhaust stud but I have nowhere to begin or even confirm that's the right term.</TEXT>

LeBron is missing free throws for no reason and the competition will hit their shot no matter how guarded they are. Am I right or am I just not playing the game hard enough?</TEXT>

    <TEXT>###Build Help/Ready: **Have you read the sidebar and [rules](http://www.reddit.com/r/buildapc/wiki/rules)? (Please do)** Yes **What is your intended use for this build? The more details the better.** I need a PC capable of editing HD (and possibly 4K) footage from a Canon G7X II and GoPro Hero 4 Silver camera , as smoothly as possible and capable of playing back the video in the preview window with no lag. The main use will be for video editing using Adobe Premiere CC 2017, but possible Adobe Lightroom use too. **If gaming, what kind of performance are you looking for? (Screen resolution, FPS, game settings)** The main use for the PC will be video editing **What is your budget (ballpark is okay)?** $1700 AUD **In what country are you purchasing your parts?** Australia **Post a draft of your potential build here (specific parts please). [Consider formatting your parts list.](http://www.reddit.com/r/buildapc/wiki/pcpp) Don't ask to be spoonfed a build (read the rules!)**. The main components I have on my wishlist so far are Intel i7 6800K, MSI Gaming X 6GB 1070, SSD Samsung 850 240GB. I have no clue about what is bang for buck on any other components, such as motherboard, RAM, cooler, PSU or case. **Provide any additional details you wish below.** Admittedly, I haven't built or looked into PCs for about 15 years, and alot has changed since then (liquid cooling anyone?) The main use will be for editing videos for blogs and travel videos, with light After Effects and Lightroom use. I have even considered this http://www.msy.com.au/SYSTEMS/x99.pdf but thought it might be too much too soon. I'm really looking for "money's worth" because I don't want to spend a lot on what could be just a little bit more benefit in getting the job done. Any parts from the wishlist can be negotiated such as the processor (i7-6700K 4.0GHz Quad-Core Processor or GTX 1060 6GB Windforce Gigabyte) but I heard Nvidia cards have CUDA for rendering (correct me if I'm wrong) And please note, it's not that I'm asking to be spoonfed, it's just that I don' know what parts are compatible with what now. **NOTE: You do not have to follow this format, but please be sure to answer these questions. Please do not ask to simply be given a build. You are welcome to delete this section.**</TEXT>

I always just expected it to be whisper quiet. Also, it gets a little warm at the bottom, for obvious reasons so the metal plate gets hot, so once again, is this normal? One last thing. One screw does seem to not be a new screw, anyone else get this on their brand new DJI Mavic. Could it be a refurb, sold as new stock (came from DJI direct) or just because production was being rushed? http://i.imgur.com/jNYTmNo.jpg</TEXT>

Therefore you don't have to discharge it the whole way, or even to 30%) even before having to charge it to full again. I know that when storing the battery or travelling with it it should still remain at approximately 30%, but my main point is about charging.

    <TITLE>Some quick questions from a beginner editor</TITLE>
    <DATE>2017-01-09 03:26:16</DATE>
    <TEXT>I'm new and I have so many questions but I'll start with the two main ones I'm coming across right now. 1. If the sequence I use is based on 60fps, how do I make some clips 30fps so that it's smooth slow motion. Usually I shoot in 60fps and use a 30fps timeline, this gives me slow motion, but now that I'm vlogging I only want SOME scenes in slow motion and others in real time. 2. I know the ideal setup is to have to multiple hard drives when editing with Premiere Pro, and right now I have one SSD which I boot off and another with all my clips. If I use a USB 3.0 external HDD will that make my editing process faster, or is there some bottleneck that I'm not thinking of? 3. If I have a PC capable of editing video in 1080p real time, will using a proxy and editing in 720p make the process any faster or would proxies just be a waste of time?</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I have heard that there is surge of iconic Filipino movies that have been converted to HD, and from what I can gather, most are released only online - no Bluray versions to purchase. Since I live overseas and don't want to make an account to check, those that access iTunes in Philippines or USA are there HD Filipino movies to watch? Sana Maulit Muli, Labs Kita Okay Ka Lang, Hey Babe, Kailangan Kita, Gimik The Reunion I've looked at other "options" online and I can't find the HD versions</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Do I just drag and drop the footage and Premiere automatically converts it? I recall I read somewhere that this method drops frames, is that a good or a bad thing? So wouldn't it be better to interpret my 60fps footage into 30fps footage (but then I would be constantly doubling the speed of the footage just to get normal playback) If I do interpret the footage or drop it into a 30fps sequence, does that mean I now can't slow down my footage to 50 percent to make ultra smooth slow motion? Or do the fast and slow time remapping effect? So many questions but I'm not sure if I should start my sequence at 30fps or keep it at 60fps Noob out.</TEXT>

Is it to genuinely care about customers enough for them to purchase the house that suits them, or is to lure them in with the possibility and then state to them they need just X amount more for a deposit and they'll reach their dream house? Because if it's the latter, that truly sucks. What do you get out of it? A percentage of the whole loan and a percentage for the lifetime of the loan or jut a standard rate per customer? I'm genuinely curious as I've spoken to multiple mortgage brokers who start with false promises and then the loan amount gets smaller as you proceed with the application or the financial requirements get larger.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>A few keypoints before moving forward. I live in a ground floor flat/unit on the North East side of the city. I have what is essentially a very small verandah. I have installed one amateur outdoor blind which I purchased from Bunnings and bolted it to the pavement (missing a pole) and now the wind carries it knocking everything in its path. Pole(s) may need to be installed I would like to install smaller versions on the side as I have a fence that divides me and the other ground floor neighbour but want to keep the wind out. I'm not looking to spend a lot because.. apartment (I'll eventually rent it out). If I take off the installed blind is there a way to patch up where I put the previous holes up top? Paramount Home Improvements initially installed the verandah but they went into liquidation If anyone can help me with suggestions that would be great. I don't mind calling around but wouldn't mind narrowing down places first as some can be dodgy or expensive. Thanks Radelaide.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Okay, I have two issues. Fetch TV and Adam Internet. I can see both are going to cause headaches but my Gen 1 Fetch TV box just stopped working because the company stated it would no longer support Gen 1 boxes (no warning from Adam Internet) we all know what Adam customer service is like now, so does anyone have any suggestions? Since I'm paying them for a subscription AND the box, should they not provide me with a newwer generation model? I don't want a lot of down time. Or should I bite the bullet and purchase one outright froma retail store? More importantly, anyone else going through the same issue as of today?</TEXT>

This may be a long shot but I thought I would throw it out there, does anyone have any firt hand experience or know people in those roles? Is it mainly administerial or possibly more related to "on the floor" physical work? Would I be holding team meetings and doing performance management like other government TL roles or do they run differently? I know some TL 6 staff but they seem to be more a point of reference for people on the actual floor. If you want to stay private you can PM me or otherwise any information would be highly appreciated.</TEXT>

    <DATE>2017-11-08 04:08:54</DATE>
    <TEXT>NOTICE ORDERED BY THE FEDERAL COURT OF AUSTRALIA False, misleading and deceptive conduct by MSY Technology, MSY Group and MSY NSW Following legal action by the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission (ACCC), the Federal Court of Australia declared that MSY Technology Pty Ltd (MSY Technology), MSY Group Pty Ltd (MSY Group) and M.S.Y. Technology (NSW) Pty Ltd (MSY NSW) (together MSY) engaged in conduct that contravened the Australian Consumer Law (ACL). The Court found that:  #183; MSY Technology and MSY Group made false, misleading and deceptive representations about MSY #8217;s terms and conditions on its website; and  #183; MSY NSW and MSY Technology made false, misleading and deceptive representations instore and by email communications to certain consumers who purchased faulty computer products from MSY, which representations were contrary to the consumer guarantee rights provided in the ACL. MSY #8217;s false and misleading representations for faulty computer products included statements that:  #183; consumers had to return the good to MSY within 7 days of receiving it in order to obtain an ACL remedy;  #183; MSY had the discretion to determine the ACL remedy available to the consumer on a case-by-case basis;  #183; consumers may incur an administrative fee if the product was not under a manufacturer #8217;s warranty; and  #183; the consumer would have to approach the manufacturer (not MSY) for an ACL remedy. As part of its orders, the Court has required MSY to:  #183; pay pecuniary penalties in the amount of $750,000 and the ACCC #8217;s costs of the proceeding;  #183; not publish or cause to be published on any website it operates, and not make to consumers instore, any representation that consumers #8217; rights or remedies are in any way limited, restricted or varied from those conferred on consumers under the ACL;  #183; implement a consumer law compliance program which includes staff training and a complaints handling system; and  #183; publish a phone number on MSY #8217;s website that consumers can use to raise consumer guarantee issues with a senior MSY employee.</TEXT>

Currently my PC is connected to one HDMI on the monitor via DVI to HDMI and the audio is sent out via the PCs 3.5mm audio out. I have my Nintendo Switch connected via HDMI to the other HDMI port, but to get sound from my Switch I would need to connect it via headphone out from the monitor into the RCA in the back of the speakers. My question is, if the monitor out is connected and the audio out from the PC is connected at the same time, would they not be sending out the same audio? Will this stuff up my speakers? How will this work?</TEXT>

Now it's been awhile since we had family travel into Australia, but they were on a different visa (from recollection a 3 month tourist visa) and they previously had to send their passport away to get "stamped" with the visa details. Does anyone know the details in regards to a Visitor (subclass 600) visa and if the passport needs to be sent off before being able to travel? We have already booked the flights for right after the New Year and there is no mention in the grant email stating that the passport has to be sent off so I thought I would double check. I also figured if worse case scenario there are any issues, a copy of the visa grant which as approval numbers and other details on there would suffice.

    <TITLE>DJI Mavic Air - some quick thoughts</TITLE>
    <DATE>2018-01-23 22:50:46</DATE>
    <TEXT>Is it just me, or am I impressed by the Mavic Air but at the same time underwhelmed. I think it was just because the Mavic Pro was such a game changer, the first compact drone with decent video capabilities, that anything new is sort of just minor tweaks and nothing innovating. Yes, there are feature upgrades, but a lot is reliant on marketing the software changes, which DJI have politely added to the Mavic pro recently anyways. Obstacle avoidance was so game changing on the original Mavic that this time DJI haven #8217;t even decided to largely promote the fact the Mavic Air has rear obstacle avoidance. Also, those looking for the Mavic Pro II, keep in mind it will around soon enough but apparently way overpriced. Allegedly. Thoughts?</TEXT>

So confused when it comes to flying drones in SA. Edit: The reason I'm confused is because Cleland Conseevation Park is still recognised as a "National Park"</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Sorry if this seems like a simple question, but can the Mavic firmware be updated if it is connected via only my mobile phone and wifi? So no remote control as the middle man? I ask because I updated all the firmware recently, which was fine, but when I went to use my phone only to have a quick fly via wifi it stated it needed a firmware update. So off I go and try to update it but it just stop at 5% Also, side question, are the new flight modes (specifically Dronie and Rocket) available if I only control the Mavic via Wifi?</TEXT>

I have moved from the Canon system to the Sony system and can't seem to find the switch on the Sony 18-105mm lens to change it from Autofocus to Manual focus, if there is even one. And another question, if it happens to be on AF-C or any autofocus setting, will I damage the lens if I turn the focus ring manually? Thanks for your patience with this noob.</TEXT>

What configuration or setup would people suggest to maximise effieciency and speed for video editing? Some things to note are, I like to use proxies and I don't get the difference between where the proxies are saved and what scratch disks are then used for? Would having the proxies and the scratch disk on the same drive be slower? Also, side question, why is it when I convert my media, some proxies are larger in size in comparison to the source material. Doesn't that slow down the editing then?</TEXT>

    <DATE>2018-03-14 01:34:32</DATE>
    <TEXT>I recently set up my Sony A6500 for filming video in manual mode, but then came to realize some shots are overexposed and on a different note, how important shutter speed is (i.e. shutter speed should be double the frame rate) My question is, are there any advantages in shooting video in Manual mode over Shutter priority? I figured with shutter priority the shutter speed would constantly be what I need it to be and aperture would automatically be adjusted so I don't get blown out highlights. Buy every tutorial says to shoot in Manual mode?</TEXT>

    <TITLE>Proxies and external SSD drives?</TITLE>
    <DATE>2018-03-16 02:14:18</DATE>
    <TEXT>I see a lot of tutorials where people seem to edit straight off their Samsung T5 SSD drives, I was just wondering, if I edit using proxies would the speed of the external drive even matter at all until it comes time to rendering? Wouldn't this mean I could disconnect the the hard drive altogether? Also, bonus question, I have the Seagate external SSD for Xbox which has a read/write speed of 440/430 Mbps, is this fast enough for the times I want to edit directly off it or would purchasing a Samsung T5 be the way to go?</TEXT>

    <TEXT>When Tony asks Spider-Man where he came from (first fight) he says the future. Dr. Strange congratulates Pepper Potts on her pregnancy when he first meets her and Tony (could be about the wedding though) A teenage version of Cassie Lang has officially been cast. And Captain Marvel takes place in the 90s where she could easily have a child. So I'm calling it, A4 will introduce the Young Avengers. Done. Also, this video at the 12:30 mark had me watching out for the timeline https://youtu.be/peOWYBGuUFs</TEXT>

    <DATE>2018-09-01 02:32:02</DATE>
    <TEXT>So I purchased this item from a small store in the province of Philippines, and I assume it is a fake, but to be honest I can #8217;t tell, and I haven #8217;t had a close enough look at an original box to tell. I was wondering if some avid collector could help me out. I #8217;ve found this site that shows what a fake one looks like, but mine looks closer to an original. But buying it for about $25AU from a small South East Asian store, I doubt it.

    <TITLE>NAS vs External HDD + Shield</TITLE>
    <DATE>2019-05-25 02:54:03</DATE>
    <TEXT>Noob queastion, so be patient with me. What is the better value for money or option for streaming videos inside and outside my home network using Plex. A NAS or a large external HDD (i.e. WD Red in an enclosure)? I've been considering getting a Synology DS418J but wasn't sure if it was worth it since an external HDD connected to the shield would pretty much do the same thing. Am I right thinking that buying the NAS a level up that transcodes video would be pointless since the Shield already transcodes and the NAS doesn't have to? TL;DR Better value for money: NAS that transcodes vs NAS that doesn't transcode vs external HDD for the Nvidia Shield?</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I'm in the process of purchasing a newly built house when, on closer inspection, I found that the external window sills/joints didn't have mortar Now I'm not a handyman by any means, but after speaking with a building inspector he notified me that the joints shouldn't actually neccesarily be filled with mortar, instead he showed me that the building company put expanding foam in the spaces instead. My question is, does this sound right? Will water not get in through the windows? Times have changed so I don't know what the norm is with new builds. Edit: Sorry, without being able to get a photo until tomorrow afternoon, a cut version of this stuff actually looks similar to what they stuffed in the little side gaps of the external window sills. https://www.bunnings.com.au/ormonoid-10-x-100mm-x-25m-abelflex-expansion-joint-filler_p1060067</TEXT>

    <TEXT>So I just got a DS918+ and have a single 4GB WD Red in there for now just to install applications and set it up. My question is, will the applications I install i.e. Plex be installed on the 4GB drive and what if eventually I take out that drive and replace it with x4 8TB drives, will I lose all my settings and data? Would I have to set it up from scratch again or can I somehow transfer the installed apps and data to one larger drive first so I have minimal down time?

    <DATE>2019-08-26 00:44:31</DATE>
    <TEXT>In SA, I entered into a Contract of Sale which had an addendum with fixes that needed to be completed by a date which have not been met. More importantly the vendor / builder / real estate agent did not disclose that a gas service line was not installed even though there were gas appliances. Now there are huge delays. The builder is adamant he submitted the request and assumed it was completed but now there's a trench where the gas pipe is meant to go so I assume that he would have known prior to the sale if the gas was installed or not. You would habe known if you built a trench for the pipes or not right? What are my legal options? Is this something I can break the contract on since it's an assumption on every house with gas appliances that a service line is installed.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Has anyone here used Airtasker in Adelaide before? How is the business in general, or is it mostly some shoddy drunk guy accepting gardening tasks for some other weed money? All jokes aside, can anyone comment on it here? Looking for an electrician to change some downlights to Philips Hues and someone else to fix some cabinets.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>So let me get this straight. If you originally worked part-time for 25 hours a week then had your hours reduced to say, 19 hours per week, because of Covid then you got $1500 a fortnight. Now with the new changes, and because your hours have already been dropped to below 20 hours per week because of Covid you'll only get $750 a fortnight. Shouldn't the part time hours be determined on what they used to be and not what they are on right now? I mean I can't be the only one who has had their hours reduced because of covid.</TEXT>
