    <TITLE>I met a girl today and found her on Facebook; should I message her?</TITLE>
    <DATE>2019-01-19 15:48:10</DATE>
    <TEXT>So I met a girl today and I like her. I met her at a training for work. We've talked a bit about what we study and where live; just the casual stuff Anyway, when I drove back home I kept thinking about her and started to feel lousy for not making a move. So I started to think about contacting her. The problem is that I don't have her number and there is a really slim chance that I will see her again (if there even is a chance) if I don't contact her. Back home I managed to find her on Facebook. I used some info that she told me about to look for her. The only way I can think of to contact her is via FB-messenger. My question: Should I send her a friend request via FB and message her? If yes, what should I send her to not come over as a creep. (I think I might come over as a creep as I only had her name and some other basic details to search for her). Thanks for the replies :-) Edit: for those interested. I'll keep you all up to date about the situation. The advices I've gotten are really useful. Update: I send her a friend request; she accepted. Later this day I sent her a message.As you guys said: I was being honest. I told her that she looked like a nice person to me and that I would like to know her better. Pressing that 'send' button was a difficult thing to do though ;) Anyway, she sent me a reply. Quite a nice one. She told me that she really liked it that I sent her a message and that she liked me too. However, she also told me that she doesn't really have the time for a boyfriend at the moment as she's busy with stuff for uni. I can understand that. She also told me that she hopes that we'll work together in the future. I replied to her reply and said I appreciate it and that I respect her choice. So it turned out semi-well. I got a nice reply, but the real thing I wanted didn't happen. Anway, thanks for all the help. I've used your bits of advice and it gave me a lot more confidence. Didn't really work this time, but at least I've seen that it's a nice approach.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I'm 22M and I'm in the same situation, but nowadays I don't feel bad about it. Some years back I compared myself to others, which I shouldn't have done. Back then I didn't feel the urge to date etc, but I wanted to date, because my friends did it. I realized that I wasn't ready for it yet.  #8203; Nowadays I do feel ready for it. I want to interact with girls more and this time not because my friends do it. This time it's my feeling. I stopped comparing myself to others and this made me feel better. I do feel like I have less experience than my friends, but I don't really care about that. I use the experience of my friends to get some experience and get more confident. At the moment I still don't force my first kiss; I do believe it will come sooner or later. TL;DR Try to stop comparing yourself to others. Once you feel like you're ready for dating you could ask some of your friends to help you with it (if you want to).</TEXT>

If you don't dare to approach a women because you think you'll get rected, it's a missed chance. Try to be confident. I know it's hard (I'm 5'8; which is short for Dutch man), but now I try to challenge myself and just go for it. I've noticed most women don't really care as long as you come across as confident.

    <TEXT> gt;What do you mean? Ok, im not aiming for an "unreachable" woman. I want someone who i have things in common with, get along with, and am attracted to. Im not boring, necessarily, im just a quiet, introverted guy. So, yeah I probably wouldn't want someone who is super loud and insists on being the center of attention all the time. You say that you're introverted and looking for people with whom you have things in common. Have you tried to approach the quiet girls? They are the ones who are very unlikely to make the first move and they probably share some characteristics with you.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Goedendag dames, ik ben een man van 22 jaar uit de Achterhoek (En nee, ik ben geen boer  #233;n ik heb ook geen accent van een boer ;) ). Naast dat ik een man van 22 ben, ben ik ook een bioloog in sp #233;. Een dag van mij bestaat ongeveer uit koffie drinken (!), sporten, werken en wandelen met mijn hond. Verder houd ik me graag bezig met de natuur. Vrijwel alles wat leeft vind ik interessant. Soms is het dusdanig interessant dat ik in Freek-vonkmodus ga. Als je wil kan ik van elke wandeling door de Nederlandse natuur een safari maken. In de avonduurtjes speel ik graag kok; koken is iets wat ik erg waardeer. Verder spreek ik regelmatig af met vrienden. Heb ik geen afspraak met vrienden dan lees ik een boek, kijk ik tv of game ik. Natuurlijk bezoek ik ook erg regelmatig Reddit. Verder nog wat dingen over mijn persoonlijkheid. In eerste instantie ben ik een beetje verlegen, maar als ik je eenmaal beter ken komt de ware ik naar boven. Deze ware ik heeft een gevoel voor humor (ook een gevoel voor donkere humor), komt regelmatig onverwacht uit de hoek en heeft een hekel aan onrecht. Verder ben ik in staat om  #8220;Unwritten #8221; van Natasha Bedingfield van begin tot eind uit volle borst mee te zingen. Be prepared. Wat ik ook graag doe is genieten van goede memerijen en woordgrappen maken. Naast de onserieuze kant is er bij mij ook een serieuze kant aanwezig. Ik ben onder andere erg fan van diepgaande filosofische gesprekken. Ik zoek een meisje van begin 20 dat een beetje verlegen is, een passie voor iets heeft en weet wat zij met haar leven wil. Verder kan ik het erg waarderen als je een gevoel voor humor hebt en je serieuze, intellectuele gesprekken kan voeren. Heb je zin om een keer af te spreken onder het genot van een bak koffie ( #243;f thee, fris of wat dan ook), stuur me dan een PM.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>To me it's worth it. I had braces when I was around 11 / 13 years old. I had an overbite and a diastema. The braces fixed it all. However, keep in mind that you will get a retainer that you have to wear after the braces are removed. I didn't have to wear the retainer forever. After a year with the retainer they placed some kind metallic wire behind my upper and lower front teeth. These wires keep my teeth in place. The downside of them is that you have to clean them properly (brush and floss). Plaque easily accumulates there and will turn into tartar if you don't remove it.</TEXT>

A young dude saw that, went to the squat rack and started to deload the barbell and began to do shoulder presses. I told him I was still using the squat rack to which he responded: "Was. Now I'm using it". This made me pissed but I didn't feel like discussing it with him. I just let it go and told him that it would be appreciated if he asks if someone is done with something, instead of just claiming it. Hopefully he will do this next time....</TEXT>

I also started to do this. Since I know what I lift, I can increase the weight a bit every training (using microplates). This really helps me improve and it might help you too. Besides all; eat enough. Once I started to est more, I started to become stronger :-).</TEXT>

I also haven't made as much progress as others do, but I stopped comparing myself to others. I've changed my mindset. In my opinion it's about making progress and not about making progress asap.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Ryanair. On my ticket was written "online check-in". I thought it was just a suggestion (that's how it was presented imo). At the airport I had to pay  #8364;55 because I didn't do the online check-in. Besides that; on the flight to the holiday destination I could bring my trolley for free. On the flight back I had to pay a  #8364;20 fee for the trolley. I told the lady at the counter that I could bring it for free on the flight to the destination. She just said: "That's impossible" and wouldn't discuss it further with me. Ryanair is absolute shit. Their so called 'fees' are like fines to me. 1/10; would not recommend. Edit: typos</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Okay, so this is probably not the poo, thanks. By the way, I'm getting bitten quite a lot on my upper body. The bites seem to be close to each other. I do know bed bugs are used to biting thrice in a row. My question is, how far apart will the bites often be in the case of bed bugs. Could it be centimeters apart or are the bites really close to each other? The bites appear on my body that is usually covered by pyamas / sheets. Checked my matras/bed yesterday. I didn't see expskeletons or bed bugs. The bites started to appear like two weeks ago. About 1,5 month ago I went to an airbnb for a holiday, so that also makes the bed bugs seem like a possibilty to me. Could another insect cause the things I mentioned?</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Hi, I have a question about the reps in X amount of sets. I hear different answers to my question, so I'm curious about what you guys think. My focus is on muscle growth, not strength gains. Let's say my program says I have to do 3 sets. The suggested amount of reps for a set is 12. Does this mean that I should use a weight that makes me able to reach 12 reps in all of the 3 sets, or should I be able to just hit 12 reps in the first set and fewer reps in the last two sets (because of muscle fatigue)? Thanks in advance for the answers.</TEXT>

    <TITLE>I stopped a bully.</TITLE>
    <DATE>2020-01-07 11:26:12</DATE>
    <TEXT>Yesterday I was at the gym. Next (left) to me was a boy (person 1) who seemed mentally disabled (having conversations with himself and just acting 'different'). He was having a good times. Not much later two boys (person 2+3; I think they were around 20 y.o.) got on the treadmills to the right of me. They seemed to know person 1 and started with giving easy challenges. Things like "Can you run 15km/h. I don't believe it". So person 1 accepted the challenge. It seemed fine. However, after a while it got more intense. They challenged him to go 25km/h and I could hear person 2 and 3 saying to each other that it would be nice to see person 1 fall, bc of the speed. Person 1 didn't get it that they were obviously bullying him; he probably thought it was just for fun. During the challenges I saw person 2 and 3 making videos. I assumed they were using Snapchat. They were also making fun of him. After 10 minutes or so it was still going on and without really thinking about it, I approached person 2 and 3 and confronted them with their behaviour. At first they told me to shut up, as I didn't know them (which doesn't really matter in my opinion, as their behaviour was just unacceptable). I told them their behaviour seemed wrong to me a person 1 was an easy target and didn't see that he was made fun of. Besides that, making Snaps made it worse. Person 2 (the main bully) started to ignore me when I told him about his behaviour. However, person 3 (he was not really giving the challanges, but just laughing and whispering ideas to person 2) started to talk. He told me I was right and their behaviour was wrong. After I though that I made my message / opinion clear, I walked away. When I walked away, person 2 whispered some shit to me. I didn't react to it. After I confronted the two boys, the bullying stopped, so I didn't care about what they thought of me, as I achieved my goal. I'm proud of my action, as I am quite insecure (as I'm pretty short for a man and look really young (I'm in my twneties and people often think I am 17 or 18). Because of feeling insecure, I didn't always undertake action in similiar events. Now I did and it proved I can do it. TL: DR. I stopped two bullies, helped a boy and proved myself that I shouldn't be insecure.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>*I also wantto vent a bit, as I can't tell people in my surrouding what I am experiencing at the moment. This, because it are personal problems from the girl I am dating and people in my surrounding mighy meet her sooner or later.* About two weeks ago I met a girl. We had some dates and it felt good; this is quite an understatement. We both said we really liked each other and were really happy to see each other. Besides that, I could notice she really liked me by the way she acted during our dates. However, at the beginning of the week her behavior started to change a bit. I especially noticed it via the way she was texting; it was different than before. I got suspicious and thought she was playing games with me, so yesterday I confronted her with my feelings. Then she opened up and explained me the situation. I already knew she had commitment issues, but I felt there was more she was dealing with. She told me that she's in a shitty phase since the beginning of the week. Her mom has to motivate her too do things, because if she doesn't, the girl I'm dating will not do actions / forget actions that need to be done. I know she has been in a situation like this before. Because of this I asked her if she's is ready for a relationship. At first she evaded my question and thus I asked her again. Then she told me she isn't ready now, but that she isn't sure if it is, because of the mood she is in. She assured me that she still likes me and that it's not me why she feels bad. Normally I would give up doubting people, but she feels different. I told her I will give her another chance and space/time to think about what she wants. I don't want her to do things she doesn't fully agree with. And if this doesn't become a relationship, I still think it's fine to be friends with her. We can talk very well with each other and trust each other. She's a 'different' girl, because of her problems, but for some kind of reason that makes me like her more. I also have my problems, which she knows about. I am fully aware she might get trouble again if we ever get in a relationship, though. For now we will keep texting; she is fine with that. Dating initiative is something that is up to her now; if she thinks she is ready for it, I will hear about it. Maybe more people have been in the situation I am in now. If so, I would like to read about it. :)</TEXT>

    <TITLE>Testing for homogeneity in a group; which test to use?</TITLE>
    <DATE>2020-09-04 11:38:31</DATE>
    <TEXT>It's been a while since I last worked with SPSS and I am not sure about which test to use. I am also still trying to improve my spss skills. The case: I have one sample group and I want to know if there is homogeneity (for a scale ratio) in the group. In other words. There are 72 plants in my group. I want to know if they've grown at the same speed (=is the growth uniform in the group?). At first I thought I had to use the one-sample T-test but I have no test value to compare with so I do not think this is the right test. At second thought I believe that I have to test for normality, as normality = homogeneity. So do I need to test for normality? If not, then what test should I use? Thanks in advance for the help.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Thanks for the response. I'll try to explain the case further. At first, I'll give you the info about the variables. Independent variable: height of the seedlings. Dependent variable: seed size. For now, I just check the effect of one variable. To give you more insight in the case I've written out what I did. 1) At the start, I had a batch of seeds that all came from the same 'parent' flower. 2) I divided the seeds into groups based on their diameter. 3) I planted 72 seeds from one group in a single seed tray (so I have multiple trays all with seeds coming from a certain size group) and put the trays in a so-called "germination cell" 3) After some weeks the seed trays came out of the germination cell. The seeds that germinated 'provided' me with a seedling. I measured the height of the seedlings (in cm). 4) of course not all seedlings in a seed tray have the same height. Some trays will have seedlings that are more similar (=uniform) in height to other seedlings in the tray, while in other trays it may be less uniform. 5) The goal is to find out which seed sizes produce uniform seedlings (looking at the height) and which seed size produces the most uniform seedlings. Now that I have written this out I believe that I see the problem. It is not given what uniformity is; there is no set "uniformity value" in SPSS. I think I could solve this by finding out what the median (variable: height) in a tray is. When I know this I can set a value (being lower or higher than the median) to which I can compare the heights of the whole group to. So the median will be the test/comparison value, right? In that case, I can use the one-sample t-test to find out if the height within a tray significantly differs from the median of that tray. However, this brings me to the next question. If there is no normal distribution I can not use the one sample t-test. Is it possible to have uniformity in a group that is not normally distributed? Hopefully, this cleared things up for you. I'm curious about how you think about my idea of solving the problem.</TEXT>

    <TITLE>Split data from Excel into groups in SPSS.</TITLE>
    <DATE>2020-09-14 13:45:19</DATE>
    <TEXT>I got an Excel-file from someone. I copied the needed columns in SPSS. Now I am stuck. One of the columns is divided into four different groups of diameters (let's say 1-2, 2-3, 3-4 and 4-5). The problem? SPSS doesn't see them as different groups.  #8203; I tried "Split" cases but then I get 4 sets of ANOVA-output (in stead of all outcomes in one table). How can I let SPSS see that it are different groups? So that I can add values to them (like 1-2, is group 1, 2-3 is group 2 etc). I need this, so I can run a one way ANOVA.  #8203; Thanks for the help.</TEXT>

    <TITLE>ANOVA or T-test? (or something totally else?)</TITLE>
    <DATE>2020-09-22 08:07:18</DATE>
    <TEXT>Hi! I am struggling with which test to use. The case: 1. I have multiple groups of 100 seeds with a different background (all individuals in a group of seeds were produced in the same year, season and location). 2. For each \*whole\* group I gave a score to the uniformity of germination, 1 = no uniformity, 2 = uniformity but few are faster in germination, 3 = uniformity, but some are slower, 4= uniformity. 3. I want to find out if the production background (year, season, location) has a significant effect on the uniformity of germination. Is this possible and if so how? *The idea I had at first was to use a two-way-ANOVA (if it there is "normality") but I guess this would not work as I count the group as one individual, as I give the score (1-4) to the whole group. So now I think a T-test would be better but that one doesn't work with three independent variables, right?*  #8203; In short: Which test do you guys think I should use and why? Thanks in advance for the replies.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>That's right. Every train has seeds that 1) have the same size, 2) production location, 3) year and 4) season. Variabele 2 to 4 all conist of 2 groups (like spring or autumn / 2018 or 2019). Varibale one has 4 groups. All groups will get scored via a score system that goes from 1-4. Talked about it with my mentor and he kinds hinted towards Kruskal-Wallis Test I assume I have to use the test for all the four factors independentaly. Do you think I am thinking right?</TEXT>

    <TEXT>The groups were divided as follows. Seeds with the same combination of year  #215; season  #215; production location were grouped together. Then we split each group in 4 sub groups based on size. The subgroups are called "seed batches". From then on we followed each batch during their development from sampling to adult plant. We gave a score for uniformity for the whole batch after they were done germinating. (Each batch germinated in it's own seed tray). Hopefully you get what I mean. :)</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Sorry for the slow response. Well, we made a scale. 1 = uniform; everything is the same in height. 2 = uniform, but some are taller 3 = uniform, but some are shorter 4 = not uniform So we didn't use numbers, but scored them on sight. So we looked at the whole batch and every individual. Is this what you need to know?</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I think I figured it out. I tried a different approach then you suggested but I guess it works. I used the Kruskal-Wallis Test. Grouping variable was the fraction (1-4) and the test variable was the uniformity. I did it like this analyze  gt; nonparametric test  gt; independent samples  gt; \[settings tab\]  gt; "checked" Kruskal-Wallis 1-way ANOVA (k samples)  gt; \[clicked on "Run"\]. SPSS gave "reject null hypothesis" as the decision. \ gt;\[double clicked the table\]  gt; set "view" to "pairwise comparisons. Then SPSS showed me which groups differ significantly from each other. Based on the score and the score scale going from 1 to 4, I assume that a higher score (= less uniform) than a lower score (=more uniform). So I now concluded that fraction group 2 and 4 + 2 and 3 differ significantly from each other. It made clear that the fraction consisting of small seeds was less uniform. What do you think about this approach?</TEXT>

    <TEXT>My grouping variable (=Independent Variable) was seed size. It consists of 4 groups. Group 1 e.g. would be 1,8-1,9mm. Group 2 1,9-2,0mm and so on for group 3 and 4. This is an ordinal scale right? So if I'm right you're telling me I can analyze the data with single IV each time (e.g. seed size *then* season *then* year *then location)?* However, I would not be able to see possible interactions between the IV's (as would be possible with an ANOVA) and that is what makes it less effective. So I should try the loglinear model or the ordinal logistic model?</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I guess he is okay with it. I'm doing an intern research to help improve the position on the market of the company I'm doing the intern for. Anyway, even he might be okay with it, I think it is good for me to know what is the best test in this case. Besides that, I believe it will be appreciated if I show I do more effort for it then is needed. I did find some kind of solution to take into account the fact that my DV is ordered. Some groups scored significantly higher than others. As a score of 1 the most uniform and 4 is not uniform, I assumed a higher score / rank would mean it is probably more skewed towards a score of 4 and thus less uniform. Not very accurate, but it's something. Anyway, thanks. You cleared it up a lot. I will struggle with it today (I am at the internship now)! EDIT: I have an extra question. Wanted to ask my mentor but he's in a meeting at a different location. The question. I want to combine two variables into a new one. The first variable "location" has groups 1 (Europe) and 2 (United States). The second variable "season" has groups 1 (spring) and 2 (summer). I want to combine "season  #215; location". So let's say that I would like "Spring  #215; Europe" = 1 "Spring  #215; US" = 2 "Summer  #215; Europe" = 3 "Summer  #215; US" = 4. Is there a way to make SPSS do this or do I have to do it manually?</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Well, 1 = uniform, 4 = not uniform. So after ranking (via KW-test) it would make sense that the groups with the higher Total scores are less uniform. I tried making the new variable and it worked! Thanks. Did find a manual way which worked too but it took quite a lot of effort. Your approach is easier, a lot easier ;)</TEXT>

    <TITLE>[Q] Non-normality and unequal medians between groups. Which test do perform?</TITLE>
    <DATE>2020-10-19 10:34:51</DATE>
    <TEXT>Hi, I am an intern at a plant breeding company and I am researching the effects of seed size on the plants that come from the seeds. At the moment I am struggling with my dataset. I will give you some context below. My independent variable is "seed size". The seeds were divided into 4 groups based on their size. So: the IV consists of 4 groups and is ordinal. The dependent variable is germination% At first, I wanted to run an ANOVA but I found out the DV is not normally distributed. I applied transformations to the germination% (log, probit, arcsin) and none of them made the data normally distributed. Therefore I tried to use a non-parametric test. The non-parametric test that I wanted to use was the Kruskal-Wallis test. Before I ran the test I checked if the medians between the 4 groups were equal and found out they were **not.** I tried to find a solution in literature but could not find anything. I also asked my mentor at the internship and he does not know it too (he's not a statistician but a seed physiologist with experience in statistics). Does anyone of you know what to do now? My mentor does not really care if it meets the assumptions but my professor at the uni does. This is why I still want to learn which test to use now :). Thanks in advance for the help.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I did indeed find inequalities between medians of the groups and via post-hoc tests I found out that group 4 significantly differs from groups 1, 2 and 3. Group 4 had the highest mean rank (see the link). Group 4 consists of the biggest seeds (2,25-3,0) and group 1 the smallest (1,8-1,9). https://imgur.com/n4PkQF6 However, I don't know how to interpret this data as the medians are not equal between the groups. How I did it now is as follows. I wrote down that the **mean ranks** differ significantly between group 4 v.s. group 1, 2 and 3 (group 4 having the highest rank). A higher rank means a higher germination%, thus the outcome suggests that group 4 leads to significantly higher germination%. Is my interpretation correct or can't it be said like that? If it's wrong, I would like to know what you would suggest.</TEXT>
