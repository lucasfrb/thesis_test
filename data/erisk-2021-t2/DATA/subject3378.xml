    <TEXT>It doesn't, you're right. I can't speak for anyone else, I enjoy it and the effect it has on shotty duels and it's effect on evading fire from range. The movement you are describing is present in pubg and is the largest factor keeping me in H1. If H1 employed momentum based movement I would lose my favourite distinguishing feature in a game I loved, and I'd probably switch to pubg. I don't want that to happen so I'm trying to sway the communities views to align with mine</TEXT>

    <TEXT>While the initial investment is larger, there are so many unique, free games on the PC, and games cost substantially less on the computer. Also, once you've bought a game on steam, you have it for life. If your house burns down you can sign into steam on any pc and download every game again. When I built my PC and I couldn't figure out why it wasn't working, I took it to a computer store and they got it going for 60 bucks, and I haven't had any trouble since(going on 2 years now). Plus there are so many little things that you don't realise are amazing about playing games on a PC until you try it, like discord, and having whatever you want up on your second (or third) monitor while your friends finish out the game you died right away in. Or my personal favourite: controlling Spotify with macro keys while your in game, blasting untitled no.2 while reviving your teammates after a particularly savoury clutch.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Valid, rat wasn't the greatest point maker, let's instead consider the fully legal practice of blasting a hole through any of the animals considered fine to hunt.

    <TEXT>My original intent was to comment on my surprise that legal action is taken against killers of this species of animal, and you're right to assume that I wouldn't be surprised of the same action taken against a dog killer, but you're wrong to assume that I don't think it's a big deal. I don't eat meat or dairy and I believe that our impact on every species that we don't consider pets to be negative. I don't think 99% of the people who hunt need to do it, and I don't think 99% of the meat people eat is truly "ethically" harvested. I guess what I am getting at is that if you think the killing of this opossum is unjust and you eat meat or eggs then you are crying for prison time/death penalty for someone while directly fostering the suffering of many animals</TEXT>
