    <DATE>2013-09-18 14:40:30</DATE>
    <TEXT>So it might just be from other bad champion choices or extremely good choices from the other teams, but I have been doing awful the last like 5-6 games playing with Draven, who I used to play amazingly when he was free and now I can barely even out the kdr. I am level 13 I think and only have a few runes. I usually aim towards the bloodthirster initially, but I personally think it takes too long and is more of a mid-late game build. I still consider myself relatively new and would appreciate any help I can get, thanks!</TEXT>

I figure this will help with tea diversity. Thanks in advanced. Also, I have tried being the tank, not for me.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>After joining a little after creation, MensLib has continuously restored my faith in humanity by seeing how men and women handle important issues besides just yelling at each other. Personally it was difficult to find how to battle the male stigma while being raised by a single mother because I saw what most people didn't: that there didn't have to be a "man of the house". I was never challenged when I was emotional and if my father had been in my life I know that I would have developed very different emotionally. So thank you for reaffirming my thoughts about the negative male stereotypes and how they really do affect our entire society. We can make a difference even if it's one day at a time.</TEXT>

    <TITLE>IMD Men's Issues Groups: The White Ribbon</TITLE>
    <DATE>2016-11-17 18:14:22</DATE>
    <TEXT>In a way to kickstart conversations before IMD we wanted to create a few self-posts that highlights men's issues groups starting with this one. One great resource to talk about men's issues, and what men can do to guide a new vision of masculinity (besides MensLib of course) is White Ribbon (http://www.whiteribbon.ca/).  gt;White Ribbon positively engages men, young men and boys through relevant educational programming that challenges language and behaviours, as well as harmful ideas of manhood that lead to violence against women. Through workshops, trainings and presentations we can really use this resources a guide for more learning. I definitely recommend going to their website and seeing what they offer. This is a great opportunity to help out more if you want to, or participate further in education of men's issues.</TEXT>

    <TITLE>IMD Men's Issues Groups: The CALMzone</TITLE>
    <DATE>2016-11-17 18:16:09</DATE>
    <TEXT>After doing a little research, and finding The CALMzone I realized how awesome they are in what they do. CALM stands for Campaign Against Living Miserably, and they do a lot of work with male suicide prevention.  gt;Our helpline is for men who are down or have hit a wall for any reason, who need to talk or find information and support. We're open 5pm #8211;midnight, 365 days a year. For more info about the helpline service and call costs visit our helpline page. After the largely shocking statistic that came out a few years ago (maybe it was only one, I can't remember) about suicide being the leading cause of death in men in the UK under 45 years old. It was heartbreaking news, which is why the CALMzone was created. They seek to prevent male suicide in a variety of ways such as a free hotline, webchat, and a service that helps you find locations close to you for help. Also to note their service is international, and you don't have to be in the UK to seek help from them.</TEXT>

    <DATE>2016-11-17 18:24:32</DATE>
    <TEXT>Partners in Healing is a great place for men to get support in starting your journey to healing from sexual assault/abuse.  gt;A compassionate and effective response to the behavioral health needs of male sexual abuse survivors requires holistic and trauma-informed solutions that take into account the unique challenges and sensitivities of male victims of sexual trauma. Directly from their website, Partners in Healing is an aggregate of great resources for not only professional support, but also peer support. Within the website they also have a directory for therapists, and pretty active discussion forums. One of the biggest things they want all survivors to know is that you are not alone, and you are welcome to use their resources for whatever you need.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Good morning RAOA! My name is Kyle, I've been lurking in the sub for a couple days and I figured I should finally introduce myself because you all seem like wonderful people. I'm a 24 year old cat dad of 3 feline friends and I'm engaged to be married later this year (!!!!). I'm a big fan of most things nerdy, like Star Wars, Marvel, The Adventure Zone, and therefore D amp;D. I'm also a budding cook in the kitchen and love to talk about cooking/recipes (big fan of Binging with Babish). In the past year I've found myself again and picked up playing D amp;D with some great friends, as well as picked up reading again which has been great. My next step is to be more active on reddit and make some internet friends, which is why I figured this subreddit would be a great start as you all seem lovely and easy to talk to. Thank you for all you do for each other, and....AMA I guess!</TEXT>

To make it a bit more evergreen/user friendly, I made a nifty [Google Sheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1cKk7rRrJVcDaZ2MW-OqKsI50poiCrBjJ4UahCN2lmnM/edit?usp=sharing) so anyone can submit 2-3 of their favorite songs that motivates them/gets them moving! So let everyone know what you listen to in the sheet, and maybe why you chose to share! Then, comment in this thread if you agree/love someone else's submission :)  #8203; EDIT: Thanks to everyone who have either added to the sheet, or commented. All suggestions are appreciated. In hindsight, I forgot that there are a lot of mobile users on reddit and sheets isn't the most accessible/friendly on mobile. My bad, y'all!</TEXT>

    <TITLE>The satisfaction of quickly finishing a good series.</TITLE>
    <DATE>2020-07-02 18:48:03</DATE>
    <TEXT>I just finished reading the Rebel of the Sands trilogy quicker than I've ever read any series of 3 or more books since high school. Not only was is a great, fast-paced, and interesting series, there was an indescribable feeling of satisfaction finishing them all within a month and a half. I highly recommend the series for anyone looking for something that has an interesting lore, a light romance element, and some solid fantasy storytelling! EDIT: I forgot to add it's a Fantasy YA series.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Yeah I agree, I was expecting a bit more out of the beginning and wouldn't mind going with at least 5 chapters every time. I think the prologue has me intrigued, but the first few chapters didn't really leave much up to where it was going. It may be because I was just watching Indiana Jones, but it seems like the Nazis were up to their religion/mythology search and wanted to find Atlantis for their technology. I'm puzzled in terms of the overall plot so far, but maybe their research has other implications besides with autism, like increasing overall human intelligence. Excited to keep reading!</TEXT>

    <TEXT>So close to the weekend, just two more days! One of our kitties is sick, so we have to start giving him a liquid medication, which he DOES NOT LIKE. Hopefully it clears up in a few days, I hate to see him so sneezy and congested :/ QOTD: Oddly enough the best piece of news that we've received is that due to guidelines, we have to reduce our wedding guest list to most like 50 from 150 in a few months. Having the knowledge to make decisions based on this has been a relief because now we feel like we have a bit more control over things. It'll suck not having everyone there for that day, but we're hoping to have a 1 year anniversary as our celebration with our extended family and friends.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I literally just finished reading this and as a fantasy I have to recommend it. It may not be everyone's cup of tea but it's actually refreshing how 'plain' it is for a fantasy novel. Being able to relax and enjoy the political intrigue with the occasional chuckle and gasp was almost a relief from typical higher octane, higher magic based fantasy novels. Plus, a handful of the characters are just downright delightful</TEXT>

Glad to report that our kitty Mumford is on the mend and can finally freely breathe after being stuffed up and snotty for the past week. QOTD: I'm not a huge fan of doing the dishes.

    <TEXT>Truthfully I think either 6 or 7 chapters would be the magic number for me, especially if they're short like these have been. There was a little more meat to this portion of chapters, even though we haven't been introduced to the main plot fully. I think the ClockTower meeting was more of a "well this thing we've been keeping an eye on is finally happening so..." type of meeting. I'm sort of unsure why Josh was gassed, but I think it has to do with the secrecy of it all happening and only being able to trust certain people.</TEXT>

It's a prequel series to a duology I love of hers and it's been on a my 'to-read' list for too long! I'm tagging in u/Hsks23 for this one! OMG I want to pet Lily so bad she looks like the cutest floofers, and certainly the prettiest. My personal luck charm, is my lucky number as you can guess, 22. It's a family number and if I see it in random situations if usually means good luck! Thanks for the contest :)</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Happy hump day! It's basically my Friday, which is good, because this week has been so slow. QOTD: I know it's pretty standard, but I've been consistently brushing my teeth every day for the past 4 years now. Growing up I was terrible at doing it all the time, but now I can't go without it.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I accidentally peed on my cat...no really. When [Mumford](https://imgur.com/a/v4NPp0P) was very young, he was curious what I was doing in the middle of the night one night, so he wandered in and put his little paws up on the bowl while I was going. I was still groggy when he decided to LEAP to the other side of the toilet whilst I was mid-pee and got some on him. He decided to rightfully shake it off like a dog, getting it all over the floor and nearby wall. In my sleepy state I quickly grabbed a washcloth, wet it, and cleaned him off to his disagreement. He's still just as derpy today, but he knows to leave me be while I pee.</TEXT>

I have a whole [book list](https://www.amazon.com/hz/wishlist/ls/29TQ0GFA76RRD?ref_=wl_share) :) I'd say I've been itching most to read American Gods or Born a Crime 2. My favorite book is the Hobbit because it's as simple yet all encompassing fantasy novel that got me into reading. My favorite spot to read is on my aunt's old porch because it overlooked a serene lake and it was always so calming in the mornings.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Packing and moving somewhere is the WORST! I so feel for you there. When we moved to our current house, the last thing we took was out cats because we knew they would hate the move AND THEY DID. My fiance took the moving truck with her dad and I volunteered to take the two cats in my car and it was a horrible time. They obviously hated it and yelled the whole time. I felt bad that they were uncomfortable, but it was probably one of the longest 20 minutes rides ever. Needless to say next time we move them I'll give them a bunch of cat weed... Something that would certainly make my basement feel more homey is a poster of Middle Earth ([wishlist](https://www.amazon.com/hz/wishlist/ls/35R7V09BCNWG?ref_=wl_share))</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Sorry you had a shit day, hopefully the story of how I peed on my cat cheers you up! When [Mumford](https://imgur.com/a/v4NPp0P) was very young, he was curious what I was doing in the middle of the night one night, so he wandered in and put his little paws up on the bowl while I was going. I was still groggy when he decided to LEAP to the other side of the toilet whilst I was mid-pee and got some on him. He decided to rightfully shake it off like a dog, getting it all over the floor and nearby wall. In my sleepy state I quickly grabbed a washcloth, wet it, and cleaned him off to his disagreement. He's still just as derpy today, but he knows to leave me be while I pee.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>So many ideas! Moving is not fun, so I feel for you. IF you have time and the ability to, make sure to mark each box with a number of some sort, and make a simple excel sheet mapping the numbers to the contents. That way, when you unpack, you'll know what is in each box. The offline option to this is to use a small notepad and write the contents on a piece of paper, then tape the paper to the box. Hope that helps!!</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Yay I can talk about books all day :D Based on your interest in Margaret Atwood I'd recommend Oryx and Crake! It's set in the future and is sort of a distopian novel, but I really enjoyed it because of the very flawed characters and interesting ideas about society.

    <TEXT>This answer makes my heart so happy. I love Gandalf too (he's so sassy!) I watched the movies as a kid so I don't remember all the details. I've been rewarding myself after I finish each book by watching them again and so far I agree they did a phenomenal job with the casting and production overall. I didn't know that about Christopher Lee, that's sick!! I'm about halfway through Two Towers and I feel like I've been stuck a little, but I think I'll be able to get through before 10/10 (my wedding). Plz if you need an outlet for any memes I'm very interested now that I know more of the book stuff!</TEXT>

I think Kate's rescue chapter was interesting while she was drugged up, confusing at first but the author really tried to get us deep in her perspective. I think David's touch at the end was nice, I'd love to have an epilogue with Harto and family living their best life</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Same here! I've been really impressed with how close they've been to the books with this trilogy. Jurassic Park was another good one! I will say I wish they made it more scary like they did in the book, but obviously they were still able to make it a classic. I watched the last few episodes of season 2 with my SO, and quite enjoyed it. I told her she should read the books because I figured they were also still solid.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Glad you aren't going to give up! :) One big warm fuzzy feeling I got was this weekend when I got married. My now wife and I have had to rearrange our wedding plans a couple times due to Covid, which really bummed us out. We had no idea that the smaller ceremony/reception would be exactly what we needed to make our special day even more special. I love her so much, and to be able to show it in front of our closest friends and family made it amazing. My go-to easy sweet treat is [rice krispy treats](https://www.ricekrispies.com/en_US/recipes/the-original-treats-recipe.html)</TEXT>

Reading about Maia learning about the politics and manners are you were made this very approachable and inevitably highly enjoyable.</TEXT>
