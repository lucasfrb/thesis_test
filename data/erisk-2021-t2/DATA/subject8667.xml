    <TEXT>You should look into maladaptive daydreaming. It isn't in the DSM-5 so it has no official diagnosis criteria or treatment, if you relate to it and it interferes with your daily life I would recommend talking to a professional about it :)</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I'm not a professional but it definitely sounds like a coping mechanism. A pretty cool one if I'm honest. I definitely wouldn't classify it as an unhealthy coping mechanism either so it's probably nothing to worry about. Just out of curiosity though, are you able to 'see' or picture what you think? My brain is completely empty all the time it's fascinating to me that people are able to have whole worlds all in their mind lol.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Hearing voices could be a sign of a mental health problem. But it's also possibly to hear voices and not have any mental health problems so I would say it is normal. You seem to be aware that they aren't auditory hallucinations and you haven't said anything to suggest that the voices are causing you distress in daily life, so it's probably fine, but definitely try and seek help or talk to someone about it if you feel they are causing you too much distress or that they start interfering with your daily life.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>That's a shame. Well at least you're educated enough to see through it. You could try and educate her about how what she is doing is wrong, but I know people like that can be stubborn for my own experience.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Yikes. She used the term "mortal beings"? Honestly that sounds like something I would say while I'm manic lol. Also just an idea, I'm no professional lol. Have you heard of factitious disorder? It might be worth googling and seeing if the symptoms describe her well. idk, like I said just an idea. Either way her actions could trigger people who actually suffer which is obviously not good, you seem like a good friend tho so hopefully you can get through to her eventually :)</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I don't know tbh. probably don't ask her that. Instead ask her if she has gone to a therapist or psychologist for her 'illness'. I know it's hard to talk about mental health, especially to friends so ofc if you're uncomfortable asking her anything, don't ask her. Also I noticed on a reply to someone else you said she 'has' OCD, depression, schizophrenia among others. I would just like to give my 2 cents here. I have bipolar type II and it took 5 long and painful years for me to get that diagnosis. It can take years to get a mental illness diagnosis and if she's 17 it's very unlikely she was diagnosed with so many at such a young age, especially schizophrenia. But I guess anything is possible :) Sorry for my long replies lmao, people that pretend to have mental health issues annoy me just as much as they probably annoy you  gt;. lt; i've only ever had to deal with 1 person in my life that was pretending and it was honestly very infuriating trying to talk to them about it lol. Eventually after a few months of pretending to have BPD, he was magically cured overnight smh...</TEXT>

    <TEXT>You're 100% right, she's probably making it all up (most of it anyway). Some of my closest in real life friends aren't even aware I have mental health issues, there is absolutely no way I would glorify it on social media to fit my aesthetic. It's alright to be concerned about it because she's a friend and: 1. It might trigger someone who is legit struggling and it kind of takes away from the seriousness of their struggles. 2. There is probably a reason she is doing this for attention in the first place. She may just like to get attention and feel important, but she's going about getting it in completely the wrong way. Not sure how you could change her mind about it, you seem more educated than her on mental health issues so maybe you could try and have a conversation with her about it and help her understand why what she is doing is wrong? Anyway I hope all goes well, for both of you  lt;3</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Wow I'm sorry you parents aren't supportive of you :'( I know it's hard but try not to give up. If you don't want to drop out because you love psychology, then don't drop out. Don't let what your mom or dad thinks of you affect what you do with **your** life, you should do what you enjoy doing. Also you can 100% work in the psychology field with social anxiety. I know not everyone has access or can afford to get the help they need but just know that social anxiety is a fully treatable condition and can be overcome with effective therapy, work, and patience. You could even just google some CBT techniques and do it on your own and it might help a bit.  lt;3</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Well the fact that you're in treatment is the first major step in overcoming mental illness so that's good! It took me almost 3 years to find a medication that worked for me so I relate to nothing working, I once felt like that too :/ I hope you can kick social anxiety's ass and pursue the career you want! I might not know you personally but I still love you and so do many others  lt;3</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Coming from someone who starting off cutting as a coping mechanism and today has a full on addiction, PLEASE DON'T START. It is honestly fucking horrible and it solves absolutely nothing. It becomes such an ugly addiction super quick. I have scars all over my body that will never go away and for what?? A few minutes of relief? Absolutely not worth it and it has become almost impossible for me to stop. Please try and find a healthy coping mechanism! Ily  lt;3</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Sorry you had to go through that :( What you described sounds similar to what happens to me when I dissociate. I personally would describe my dissociation as leaving reality for a few hours/days. It's usually triggered when I get into super anxious situations, or it can happen to me for no reason :/</TEXT>

    <TEXT> gt; I want to talk to my friends about this but, I feel that it's selfish and I need to figure out how this by myself. It isn't selfish to ask someone for help. If they truly are your friends they would prefer you tell them than not. It can be scary being vulnerable I know but please talk to someone you trust. It helps a lot more than you think. I'd also suggest talking to a doctor or a professional of some sort, only they can diagnose you and get you the help that you deserve! Stay strong  lt;3</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Similar situation to you, I still SH today but I have SH scars from years ago from cuts that weren't even that deep, I thought they would fade over time but they didn't. When I was at a doctor appointment that was unrelated to SH, he said that there is an oil that could make the appearance of the scars fade a bit (or fully if they're small) if I wanted to try it, but I declined. Knowing something like that exists was somewhat comforting if i ever change my mind :)</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Any form of harming yourself is self-harm unfortunately :/ You say you do it when you're bored. Has it been going on for a long time? It could be that it's become compulsive/addictive maybe?</TEXT>

    <TEXT>If you can stop that would be for the best! Scratching yourself to draw blood is definitely SH. Not sure about the other two, I guess technically hair pulling and picking at skin are self-harm, but I believe there is actual disorders for both of them, might be worth looking into if it's an issue. Good luck and stay safe  lt;3</TEXT>
