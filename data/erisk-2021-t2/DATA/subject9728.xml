    <TITLE>Question?</TITLE>
    <DATE>2018-05-24 18:50:53</DATE>
    <TEXT>I'm 18 and a seasoned hamster owner. My current baby (Pixel) is just over 4 and recently had a stroke. Just after the stroke she couldn't walk with her back legs, couldn't empty her cheeks or reach up to her water bottle to drink. I didn't think she'd live the night. Low and behold she's still here 5 days later and is seemingly gaining back her strength. My question is; do you think this is one last boost before the end or could she actually recover? None of my hamsters have ever had a stroke.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I posted about a month ago about I posted about my 4 year old hamster, Pixel, having a stroke. Low and behold by some miracle she pulled through and has pretty much recovered minus some leg stiffness and balance problems. However, this morning she seems to have had another, smaller stroke. I don't know what to do anymore. I expected her to die. I don't want her to die but I also don't want her to be in pain. What do I do? She seems so sick but she doesn't seem to have noticed how ill she is.</TEXT>

I was just wondering if anyone has any tips or tricks to cutti by black pig nails? Thanks in advance :)</TEXT>

I know it's normal to re-arrange the cage when they've been cleaned out but scream? It's super loud and really annoys my cat. I've owned 6 hamsters and she's the only one that has done this. Side note, she also hates my mam. No reason to hate her, she just does.</TEXT>

    <TITLE>Sometimes a small cage is ok</TITLE>
    <DATE>2018-09-03 01:42:25</DATE>
    <TEXT>OK, so, here we go. Recently in hamster groups I've seen people being attacked for having a small cage for their hamsters (me included) my hamster, pixel, lives is a small 'starter' cage. I posted a picture of her in it onto a Facebook group and I ended up being abused and banned from the group because her cage was 'too small' and it 'wasn't fair'. What people failed to do was ask why she was in there. Pixel is over 4 years old and has arthritis which stops her walking much, hence the small cage with no extra levels. Aside from her arthritis she has also suffered two strokes (one major, one minor) and has had at least 2 bouts of wet tail all of which I have nursed her through. I've spent nights sitting with her, giving her water from a syringe and cleaning her up. That is why she is in such a small cage. I can say with 100% certainty she is happy in there and is much more comfortable in there than she would be in a bigger cage. So please, before you judge and shame someone for having their hamster in a small cage, see if there's a reason why.</TEXT>

And I have for around and a half years. My migraines cause me to be basically useless; can't go out, can use a computer etc. I was meant to stay at his house tonight but I've had to cancel due to a migraine. Him and his friend have said I'm being 'childish' and should just 'get over it'. I don't know what to do, I already feel crappy because of my head and he's making me feel like it's my fault.

It was creased, stank of cigarette smoke and has a rip in the back. I can no longer sell it because of the damage they caused. Would I have any legal standing if I got the police involved?

    <DATE>2019-04-07 01:33:14</DATE>
    <TEXT>Obligatory I'm a mobile user, formatting, etc. Cast: Me - M My Dad - D Entitled mam - EM Entitled kids - EK1 and EK2 (I guess they're not the entitles ones but I can't think of anything better) Neighbours - A amp;W So, I own a cat, Pudding. She was my neighbours cat but they gave her to us when they moved away as she hung out at our house a lot and, since they were moving across town and since cats are cats she'd have probably found her way back here again. Two says after Pudding became officially ours she went missing. This isn't uncommon for her as she is an outdoor cat so comes and goes as she pleases but I started to worry when she didn't come home for her supper. She is quite possibly the loudest cat in the world and if she's outside will scream at windows and doors until someone let's her in. I decided to go look for her and took a box of cat biscuits to shake around to see if she'd show up, she did not. I notice that there's lights on in puddings old house indicating that someone had moved in so I wandered over to introduce myself and ask if they'd seen pudding. I knock on the door and that's my first encounter with the EM. M: hey, I live across the street EM: oh he.. Before she'd even finished her sentence Pudding came darting out followed by two smallish children (probably around 3 and 6) EM: EK1 EK2 GET BACK HERE She screamed, deafening me. The older child is holding my cat under the armpits and carrying her back into their house. M - hey, nice cat, she kinda looks like mine... I say, hinting to the EM. EM - oh, yeah, isn't she cute. She just showed up this morning, I guess she comes with the house haha. M - haha, yeah, she used to belong to the old owners but they As I'm talking I hear the cat hiss and angrily meow as EK2 comes through EK2 - mummy mummy lucky bit EK1 Now, I know my cat she only bites when she thinks we're playing and even then it's not a full bite. The mother runs through to the other room as Pudding runs out. I pick her up and hold her, debating whether I should just walk away with my cat and be done with it when the KM comes out clutching EK1 in her arms. She sees the cat in my arms and looks irate EM - What the hell do you think you're doing holding our cat? M - well, as I was trying to say EM - put her down immediatly I comply, feeling pudding getting figity and bolts towards my house. EM looks horrified and both kids are on the verge of tears talking about how 'mummy you promised it was our kitty' and 'will lucky come home' The EM starts berating me about it, how it's 'their cat' and 'it came with the house' I am almost crying at this point when I hear my saviour. My dad arriving home from work had seen me being shouted at and pulled up. He got out and walked up to stand behind me. My dad if 6ft tall and probably around 300lbs, he's missing two of his front teeth and looks, for all intensive purposes, terrifying. (If you get to know him is actually lovely) EM looks scared, the kids look scared, damn even I'm scared. My dad stands behind me and in his low voice, D - why are you shouting at my daughter? EM - she stole me cat She yelled, clearly pissed that he'd stepped in D - I'm so sorry. That doesn't sound like her at all but watch does your cat look like and I'm sure we can figure this out. EM pulls out her phone to show a photo of her kids playing with Pudding. D - that's odd, your cat looks almost identical to my cat He says, twinging what was happening. EM - well, lucky is my cat. She came with the house. D - no. She didn't. The previous owners gave her to my daughter when they moved. Do you want me to give them a call. On hearing this EM slammed the door. I was confused and didn't know why but my dad said he'd explain at home and took my hand to lead me back. Apparently, the previous owners had moved to a smaller property that they rented out and offered those tennents (EM and kids) the house they had lived in over the road from me. EM had been in trouble with A amp;W in the past house and were on a final warning, hence slamming the door at the mention of calling them. I'm happy to report that Pudding is now safe at home with me, she's sitting on my feet as I write this and A amp;W have been informed of what EM did, they said they will be terminating the lease at the end of the contract in 2 months. Hope you enjoyed my story, here's some pictures of Pudding  #128570; https://imgur.com/gallery/Hbi16OF EDIT For people that can't see in imgur link, here's a picture of pudding I posted a while ago https://www.reddit.com/r/catbellies/comments/8vkgc6/cat_belly_ft_a_curled_feetsie/?utm_medium=android_app amp;utm_source=share</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I've spoken to a couple friends and they said it's not normal but I wanted to get a broader answer. 1. Constant need to pee but when I go there's no actual pee 2. I feel like I'm going to throw up most of the time 3. Incredibly light periods that happen every 6 weeks I just don't know anymore. I got the implant July 2017 and since then it's been a bit weird but I always just thought it was that</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Probably obvious but I've got a UTI. It's a pretty bad UTI. I had symptoms for around 36 hours prior to seeing a doctor. By the time I got to my GP I was curled up in bed, with a hot water bottle, crying. My GP told me if I had waited till the next day (my mam took me in to the doctors 15 minutes before they closed for the day) I would probably have been in hospital. I'm on two types of antibiotics; one for my upper urinary tract, one for my lower urinary tract. I feel like shit. I've been sick a lot today, I can't keep food down. I've been incredibly dizzy and passed out twice. Long story short, if you think you've got a UTI, even a little one, see a doctor as soon as possible. Thank you for reading this.</TEXT>

It seems to have healed up well but I'm looking for advice to make sure it doesn't happen again or if it does, what we can do about it. Thanks :)</TEXT>

    <TITLE>Dancing (looking for feedback)</TITLE>
    <DATE>2019-05-28 12:01:07</DATE>
    <TEXT>Dancing. I love dancing. I #8217;ve always loved dancing. Since I went to my first dance class aged 4. Ballet was my thing. Competitions, shows, recitals. I #8217;ve done them all. I love dancing in the woods behind my house. No people. Just me, dancing. Running through the woods, leaping and jumping; spinning and turning. I knew every inch of those woods. From the streams to the trees to the little rocky outcrop. Dancing has helped me learn those woods. I #8217;m dancing now. Dancing through the woods. Running and tumbling with grace and elegance. The trees bowing to touch my hair as I dance. Leaves jumping up behind me. A woodpecker clapping for me. Birds sing for me and create my music. Dancing is an escape. An escape from school. An escape from family. An escape from friends. Dancing is my escape. Deeper into the forest I dance. A grand jet #233; pulls me across the stream. The sound of the water, rippling over rocks, soothes me. This dance is going to change my life. The clearing. A small glade. Grass tickles my ankles as I dance. The glade is empty. No trees. No people. No signs of life. It #8217;s just me. I #8217;m breathing deeply. If I carry on. Past the glade. My life will never be the same. Dancing further away from the center. Slowly. I make my way to the far edge. I wave. One final goodbye to my old life. I take off. Running and dancing away. Away from my old life. I take a necklace from pocket. It is made of rope. A rope loop with a long bit down my back. I run and I dance and I escape. The outcrop is coming up. A drop of eight feet. An old pine tree juts out to around three feet. Perfect. This will be my place. The place I change my life. Change it for the better. I slow as I reach the rocks. I stop just above the drop. My necklace loops perfectly around a notch in the old tree. This is it. This is now. My life. Changed forever. A final temps lev #233; pushes me over the edge. Birds singing. Woodpecker clapping. Leaves jumping. Trees bowing. Dancing. Forever dancing. I #8217;ve always loved dancing. Now I always can.</TEXT>

    <TITLE>My worst bus journey ever</TITLE>
    <DATE>2019-06-27 02:53:29</DATE>
    <TEXT>Background: My entire life my dad has been a bus driver and because of this I grew up to love riding on buses, I even have a free bus pass through my dad which I use a lot. This happened about a year ago. My dad was driving the bus to from my town to the next city, it's about 1h45m each way. Since I had some work to catch up on and the bus had wifi I decided to tag along and get some of it done. I sat at the back on the top deck, leaned up against the corner with my laptop out. The way there was good, I actually finished all my work. After we got to the city there was a 10 minute break so I bought myself a drink but the whole time I felt someone was watching me but when I looked around no one seemed to have even noticed me, everyone was busily walking to their buses. But I just couldn't shake the feeling. After I'd bought my drink and did my thing in the bathroom I went out and boarded the bus with my dad. I walked upstairs and sat back down in my original seat. As the bus pulled away I still felt someone was watching me so I moved to about halfway down the bus so I would be closer to the stairs and therefore closer to my dad however, because I still had an hour and a half I didn't want to sit downstairs in case someone tried to sit next to me. Cut forward half an hour. I have 1 hour remaining till I get off and that's when I notice him. I very tall man, probably around 6'3" walking down the bus, neck bent to the side so he didn't bang his head. He sat down on the seat across the aisle from mine. He just sat down and stared at me. For the next half an hour he just sat and stared, he didn't move, he didn't even seem to blink. I decided at the next stop to pretend to get off and go to sit downstairs. Someone rings the bell, I stand up before the bus has stopped moving and walk downstairs. The tall guy follows me, closely. He was pressed up against me as I stood on the bottom step, waiting for the bus to stop so I wasnt thrown forwards. I move to sit at the back of the bus. The back row of the downstairs of the bus had 5 seats facing forwards and then two seats facing backwards on each side. I sit on one of the backwards facing seats in front of an older lady (late 30s or early 40s). The guy follows me and sits on the middle back seat facing forwards, staring at me. I give the women in front of my 'help me' eyes as best I could, she gave me a brief, sympathetic smile before picking up her stuff and pressing the bell to get off the bus. I have 50 minutes left. The man moves seats, sliding over so he's sat in the seat diagonal from mine with his feet on the seat next to me, preventing my escape. The next 30 minutes were agonising. He stared at me, he stared into my soul. It was terrifying, he was tall and imposing but his face was soft. He was a very skinny man but his face was chubby and strange looking. I usually associate chubby faces with smiles and happiness but his was different, contorted and sour looking. Pulling up to the bus station in my town. Less than a minute and I'm free and that's when it happened. As he stood up to get off the bus he smiled and waved at me. I, trying not to offend him, lifted my hand and put it back down again. I turned to grab my bag off the floor and he did it. He basically jumped on top of me. He held me down and tried to kiss me. I screamed at the top of my lungs and my dad moved quicker than I've ever seen out if the cab. My dad is 6ft tall and over 300lbs so he is a huge looking man, especially in a bus. He scream at the man "GET THE FUCK OFF MY DAUGHTER JAMES BEFORE I GET YOU OFF HER!" I've never heard anything so loud in my life. This man flew off me and ran towards my dad who stepped into the gap between some seats to let him past. The man ran. He ran off the bus and just kept running until he went round a corner and I couldn't see him. My dad walked over to me and hugged me, he just held me for a good minute apologising to me the whole time. After I got home that might my dad explained who the man was. His name was James (fake name of course) and he's known for doing this to women. Staring at them and then trying to kiss them before he gets off. He's deaf and dumb and uses that as defense, saying that he didn't know they had said no despite people shoving him away and once breaking his nose. They had tried to get him banned from the buses but he wrote a complaint to head office and the revoked the ban without consulting the depot. The next day my dad pulled the footage from the bus and sent it to the police but nothing ever came of it besides him having a permanent, unrevokable ban from riding on anything owned by the company. That's buses, some metro trains and a couple ferries. James the bus guy stopped me riding buses for at least 6 months. Even now I'm apprehensive about riding buses alone. So James the bus guy, let's not meet.</TEXT>

    <DATE>2019-07-01 02:55:11</DATE>
    <TEXT>So here I am, 9 months after my first appointment. Waiting for my thrid set of bloods to be taken tomorrow. I was told by the first doctor I saw that it lined up perfectly with CFS and because my Nan had it there's no point in seeing anyone else because that's my diagnosis. I thought it was weird that I was diagnosed after one appointment and no tests so I made an appointment to see another GP. GP2 told me I needed bloods and guess what? My inflammatory markers were raised. GP2 told me to come back three months later for another test and guess what? Same results. One referral later and I'm not being seen by immunology and rheumatology for my third set of bloods to be taken tomorrow. They're thinking lupus and I'm scared. I still have a diagnosis of CFS and for the first time ever I really really want to have it. If it's CFS then it's safe. I know about CFS, I know what it is and how to cope with it. CFS means my body isn't attacking itself CFS means I'm okay.</TEXT>

I also feel that I use the more I won't be granted at by butt heads on the bus.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I say this as an overweight, disabled, autistic, pansexual, female short-ass. I will always be the butt of jokes because I'm different. Anyone else that's different will be the butt of a joke, people should just get over it and either move on or join in. MOST of the time it's not malicious or mean it's just someone trying to make light of something. I probably make more sexist jokes than any of my friends. I also hate the gatekeeping of 'only x can make fun of x'</TEXT>

    <TITLE>AITA for not supporting my friends rap career?</TITLE>
    <DATE>2019-07-16 20:43:52</DATE>
    <TEXT>I got an excited text from a friend, T, telling me he quit his job. His job was a minimum wage buisness apprentiship so he was earning  #163;3.90 an hour. Leaving this apprentiship means he is basically unqualified past a secondary school level. He told me that he wants to be a rapper, that he's written loads of lyrics and that he is in contact with a producer. After I pressed him to see his lyrics or tell me the name of the producer he told me that the 'producer' has only ever made his own music but refused to let me find him or hear his music. I think my friend is making a massive mistake and I'm the type of person to call you out for being a bit stupid. So reddit, AITA?</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I say this as a non-binary human. Pronouns like xim/xer should not exist. There is already she/her for girls, he/him for guys and they/them for people that feel like they don't fit into those two boxes. Pronouns like xim/xer just further alienate a community that is often seen as outsiders. I personally use she/her or they/them pronouns. I don't understand why people want to differentiate themselves further or make themselves seem less, for lack of a better word, 'normal'. I've noticed a lot of NB people are kicked from trans communities and from cis communities and I just don't understand why you'd further push yourself from them. EDIT: I now think their should be 2 sets of 4 pronouns. Like he/his/him/he's but one set for animate and one for inanimate</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I started going by my new name in March 2016, just before my 15th birthday. A teacher of mine advised me that it was easier to change your name legally after you turn 18 so I decided to wait a few years to make sure I liked the new name and to hopefully make the process easier. I turned 18 in March and no amount of research has given me a straight answer about how to change my name. All me exams are in my new name as well as my dentist but doctors and banks refuse to accept it without legal documentation and it's really bothering me when people refer to me as my old name. How do I change it? And roughly how much money do I need to save up?</TEXT>

    <TEXT>August basically killed me. From start to finish I've been super duper busy. I did a thing at least every other day and I think last night finished me off. It was my boyfriends stepdads 60th and it was a surprisingly crazy night. Drinking and dancing and then going to a club with a few friends where I promptly fell asleep on a sofa. Don't quite know how I fell asleep in a club on a saturday night but there you go. I also had heatstroke at the start of the month that I never fully recovered from. What do now? How do I recover from this? Or am I destined to never be back to how I was before this?</TEXT>

    <DATE>2019-09-04 17:51:12</DATE>
    <TEXT>For context I'm 18 and was going through intense trauma therapy. I've had 3 sessions with this particular therapist. The sessions were supposed to be me reliving things that happened to me in hope of recovering from them. So far she has been 10 minutes late to two of the sessions and then the sessions have only lasted around 25 minutes. Each session should last for 50. She has also barely touched on trauma at all, save for giving me some websites to look at, and instead chose to focus on attempting to give me CBT for my depression. Not only is my depression directly caused by my PTSD and illness but I had CBT for 2 years and it did nothing. I specifically told her at the start that CBT was out of the question and does not work for me. Every session I've had she acts and sounds super condescending. Talking to me like I don't understand my own mind. Whenever I try to bring up the trauma she just says "aww, that must have been really difficult. Now should we go back to this?" In the sort of sing song voice you use to talk to a baby or a dog. I want to scream at her. I want to slap her. I want to stop her treating people like this. I'm not going to but what I want to do is write to her employer. Explain everything to them however I have heard from other people in the community that she is on a final warning with her employer. I don't want to be responsible for ruining her career.</TEXT>

    <TITLE>Does an out of date passport found as proof of age?</TITLE>
    <DATE>2019-10-19 16:23:22</DATE>
    <TEXT>I'm 18 and in England. The only ID I currently have is my old passport which expired last August. I've had around a 50/50 hit or miss rate of people accepting it. I was just wondering if it actually does count as proof of age? In my mind it being expired doesn't matter because it still shows how old I am. It's not like I'm trying to leave the country and my birthday hasn't moved. Does an out of date passport count as proof of age? And if it does is there anything I can do to make people accept it?</TEXT>

    <TEXT>He is 45 and 350lbs. He is a pre-diabetic and on a bunch of medications for it. He also has a heart condition. Earlier today I watched him eat 20 chicken nuggets, large fries, cheese bites and a large milkshake. That alone is over 2000 calories. He says he's trying to lose weight with slimfast but the milkshakes have 230 calories each which means he's has more than 2500 calories, not including snacks. I don't want to lose my dad ever bus especially not so young. I want him to be able to see me get better, get married, have kids. I want my dad to be able to be proud of me.</TEXT>

    <TITLE>Applying for PIP and am I likely to get it?</TITLE>
    <DATE>2019-10-20 15:17:57</DATE>
    <TEXT>First off, I've tried applying before by post. I sent of a request letter and got one back 3 months later saying "please ring this number if you wish to request a PIP application". One of my problems is autism and that makes it so that I can't talk on the phone. I struggle to talk to my mam on the phone, let alone some stranger. The website says that I can have someone ring on my behalf but will I need to talk to them to confirm that it's on my behalf? That happened with the doctors and I ended up hanging up the phone and going in person. Secondly, at this point my most likely diagnosis looks like CFS and FM and something autoimmune but at this point who knows what that is. 5/7 days I'm housebound, I can usually manage to cook one meal a day, most weeks I only manage to have a bath once a week (can't shower anymore because I can't really stand that long). I use crutches to get around and most of the time will sleep 12+ hours a day. I still feel like I'm not actually disabled. There's people that can't talk or can't walk or can't live independently. I feel like I shouldn't get it because I'm not *that* disabled. I guess this kind of a rand more than a question, sorry</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I have (we think) chronic fatigue syndrome and fibromyalgia and because of this I use crutches to help with pain and balance. I was supposed to be going out to a party on halloween with a few friends. The friend who's house it was at sent my boyfriend a message saying "Hey, can you ask Mog not to bring her crutches?" No lead up, nothing. Just that message. My boyfriend, obviously baffled by the odd request asked why. The friend replied "I just think they're unnecessary, it's not like she needs them". I don't even know what to do. It's taken me months to become okay with using them because I *look* completely fine. UPDATE: I'm allowed to bring the crutches but I have to leave them outside and I can't even mention them.</TEXT>

    <TITLE>Is it worth seeing a doctor about acid reflux?</TITLE>
    <DATE>2019-11-11 11:22:41</DATE>
    <TEXT>Female, 18, UK. I've had reflux for as long as I can remember. As a baby I would scream after I ate but the health visitor told my mam I was just a fussy baby. As a kid I would try and tell my mam my throat was on fire but she thought I was just making excuses to not do things. It wasn't till I was 11 I found out what reflux was and started taking chalk pills. As great as chalk pills are they only help for ~half an hour and the liquid ones make me gag. I was on stomach protectors for a while which kind of helped but not really. Could this be something other than just reflux? Is it worth seeing a doctor about it?</TEXT>

    <TEXT>This happened on halloween. He told me I wasn't allowed to bring them to the part because "you can walk normally most of the time so you clearly don't need them". If it had been in person, I would've slapped him. At that point my boyfriend stepped in on my behalf, chewing him out about it. He told their other friend who joined in on chewing him out. In a couple days my boyfriend is meeting up with 'friend' to sort it out face to face and, most likely, drop him completely as a friend. This isn't the first thing he's done to upset us but it'll be the last.

    <TEXT>18 Female England PTSD, depression, ADD, anxiety, history of suicidal tendencies and self harm but not for a while. Over the past year I've had 3 strange episodes. I don't remember much but during them all I wanted to do was walk away. Apparently I kept telling people "I need to go" and "it's time". And during the most recent one my boyfriend was holding me as I cried super hard and I just kept telling him that everything was too far to the left. I can go into more detail on them in the comments if that would be helpful. Last time I went to the GP they tried to force me into therapy to do CBT. I had CBT for a year with two therapists with no results. I declined and my doctor told me that if I didn't accept it I would never get over it.</TEXT>

    <TITLE>I am so angry at the women on the bus!</TITLE>
    <DATE>2020-01-23 10:53:27</DATE>
    <TEXT>This happened 20 minutes ago and I'm fuming. I have fibromyalgia and am currently in the middle of a bad flare up, my entire body hurts and when people touch me it feels like my skin is burning. So coming back from town I was sat on the bus waiting for everyone to board. A gaggle of old women (all at least 65 but I'd say at least mid 70s) got on and walked straight up to me. I was sat in the priority seating area because pain. Usually I would move but I honestly wasn't sure if I could get up the steps. They stood over me, demanding that I move now or they would get the driver. Now I get this bus a lot and I know the driver, he knows I'm disabled so would've stuck up for me. I say I won't move because I'm disabled. They demand to see my disabled pass. I don't have a disabled pass, I have a staff pass because my dad works for the bus company. I tried to explain this to them but before I can finish one of the women grabs my shoulder. It was agony. At this I decide to just move. I can't be bothered with their shit anymore. The bus sets off, everyone is happy. Two stops before mine there is a couple that rides the bus everyday and the woman is in a wheelchair and can't stand. The driver gets out and deploys the ramp but the golden girls remain seated. He asks if they're going to move and they say no. He asks if the can please move so the couple can board. They say no. The driver can't make them move so he apologises to the couple, puts the ramp away, gets back on and drives off. At the next stop the old women get off. Less then a 3 minute walk away. I am so angry that they expected me to moved but couldn't do the same for someone else. This has really pissed me off. On the plus side they were all wearing a WI badge and walked into a WI meeting so I've emailed their WI group with a picture I took of them all and an explanation of what happened.</TEXT>

At the time of the break up there was a police report filed by a friend but I never contacted the police to go for an interview. Have I waited too long to do anything about this?

    <TEXT>In the last year I've been diagnosed with chronic fatigue syndrome and fibromyalgia and had to drop out of college. Pretty much all my friends either ditched me then or forgot about me after they moved to uni or started working full time. Anyone that did stick around I've ended up pushing away during a massive depressive episode which I'm only just seeing the end of. I always try to focus on the positives but in reality my years been pretty shitty and I'm just struggling to get by.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>18F, fibromyalgia, CFS and hypermobility. I have been in pain as long as I can remember, my mam says I've complained about leg pain basically since I learned to walk. Now I suffer with pain pretty much everywhere. At this point it's making it difficult to just live. I've been on paracetamol, ibuprofen, codeine and naproxen and they hardly touched the pain. Realistically what are my options here? Pain management clinic referrals can take upwards of 6 months so that's not really an option right now.</TEXT>

Upon closer inspections he had thousands of tiny fibres stuck to his hand. He washed his hands and we've spent half an hour using tape to try and pull them off but it doesn't seem to be working. Anything else we can try? And precautions we should take?</TEXT>

Based on where I live and the timeframes I'm presuming they were concentration camp kids that were brought over since we have a few houses where they were brought after the war. I also found 4 Henry's born in 1964 and one from 1965.</TEXT>

    <TITLE>Dancing</TITLE>
    <DATE>2020-03-12 00:22:59</DATE>
    <TEXT>Dancing. I love dancing. I #8217;ve always loved dancing. Since I went to my first dance class aged 4. Ballet was my thing. Competitions, shows, recitals. I #8217;ve done them all. I love dancing in the woods behind my house. No people. Just me, dancing. Running through the woods, leaping and jumping; spinning and turning. I knew every inch of those woods. From the streams to the trees to the little rocky outcrop. Dancing has helped me learn those woods. I #8217;m dancing now. Dancing through the woods. Running and tumbling with grace and elegance. The trees bowing to touch my hair as I dance. Leaves jumping up behind me. A woodpecker clapping for me. Birds sing for me and create my music. Dancing is an escape. An escape from school. An escape from family. An escape from friends. Dancing is my escape. Deeper into the forest I dance. A grand jet #233; pulls me across the stream. The sound of the water, rippling over rocks, soothes me. This dance is going to change my life. The clearing. A small glade. Grass tickles my ankles as I dance. The glade is empty. No trees. No people. No signs of life. It #8217;s just me. I #8217;m breathing deeply. If I carry on. Past the glade. My life will never be the same. Dancing further away from the center. Slowly. I make my way to the far edge. I wave. One final goodbye to my old life. I take off. Running and dancing away. Away from my old life. I take a necklace from pocket. It is made of rope. A rope loop with a long bit down my back. I run and I dance and I escape. The outcrop is coming up. A drop of eight feet. An old pine tree juts out to around three feet. Perfect. This will be my place. The place I change my life. Change it for the better. I slow as I reach the rocks. I stop just above the drop. My necklace loops perfectly around a notch in the old tree. This is it. This is now. My life. Changed forever. A final temps lev #233; pushes me over the edge. Birds singing. Woodpecker clapping. Leaves jumping. Trees bowing. Dancing. Forever dancing. I #8217;ve always loved dancing. Now I always can.</TEXT>

    <TITLE>AITA for shouting at my mam?</TITLE>
    <DATE>2020-03-28 18:28:49</DATE>
    <TEXT>I have a tic disorder. It's like tourette's but only physical tics and no verbal tics. On this particular day we were walking through the supermarket when I started ticcing. I was repeatedly slapping my thighs and clapping and my face was twitching a lot. Usually my tics go relatively unnoticed because they're silent but obviously clapping is quite loud so people were kind of staring at me. I decided to go and sit in the car while my mam finished the shopping. After we got home my mam started to make fun of me for it and told my dad and brother about it so they were laughing about it as well. I brushed it off and went to my room and didn't talk to them much for the rest of the day. It wasn't mentioned again until yesterday when I needed to go to the supermarket for a friend. As I was leaving my mam shouted through to me and said "careful not to start clapping again" and laughed a bit. I lost it st that point. I shouted at her that I couldn't control it and it's not fair to bully me over something I can't help. I shouted for a good couple minutes before walking out. AITA for having a go at her for it? Edit: I know this makes my family seem horrible but they're not. This wasn't done with any malicious intent, they weren't trying to upset me. We all rip on eachother for stuff but this just went a bit far for me.</TEXT>

That's 24 years together and 18 years married. I was sitting in the dining room with my boyfriend. He was playing apex with his friends and I was sewing. We were together but doing separate activities and not really talking to eachother since we were busy. When my dad got home from work he asked what we were up to do I told him. He told me that it's a sign of a strong relationship to be able to sit comfortably in each other's presence without having to be doing something together and that he reckons that we'll make it as a couple. I'm a very insecure person and I'm always worried that my boyfriend will find someone better or just get sick of me so having an outside person say they think we'll last really made me happy.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I was given a diagnosis of "probably psoriasis" by my rheumatologist so that's what I'm going with since I can't see a doctor again until at least June. It affects my scalp, eyebrows, eyelids, nose and cheeks so it's really obvious and I keep getting skin in my eyes. I used coal tar shampoo twice a week for four ish weeks and it seemed to make it worse. Pretty much all soap and shampoo seems to make it worse so I've cut down to washing my hair once a week which seems to have helped a bit. What else can I try without having to see a doctor?</TEXT>

    <TEXT>This happened a few years ago when I was 15. I was in school one day when someone in my class asked why I'd never mentioned my older sister. I was really confused because I don't have an older sister so I asked what they mean. They said they'd seen me over the weekend with my mam and older sister. I just started laughing and explained that wasn't my mum and older sister. I was out with my mam and nan. I can understand why they thought that. When I was born my mam was 20 and my nan was 41 so it's 100% possible that they were my older sister and mam but it just makes me laugh. Even now we look like we could be a mother and two daughters and we're 19, 40 and 60.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I want to use someone pixelated and adapt it into a cross stitch pattern. I've messaged them but they haven't replied and they've been active on reddit since I messaged them so I can assume they've ignored me. My friend said it would be a dick move but I think I've taken reasonable steps to get their permission and they seem to have ignored me. WIBTA if I used their art to adapt into a pattern?

    <TITLE>Possibly psychosis problems, mental health nurse told me it was 'just stress'</TITLE>
    <DATE>2020-04-14 22:05:47</DATE>
    <TEXT>I'm a 19 y/o female with PTSD (diagnosed mid 2019 but stemming from an abusive relationship that lasted March 2017 to November 2018) autism (diagnosed 2015), depression and anxiety (diagnosed 2011/2012ish). No known family history of mental illness but my Dad was adopted as a baby so his genetic history is a mystery. Since at least November 2018 I've had at least 5 episodes of blacking out. I'm still consious but I don't have any recollection of them. The people who've seen my like that tell me that I have glazed look, I don't look at people when I talk or particularly address people. I don't answer them if the talk to me and tend to just keep repeating the same phrases. I also tend to try and walk away and leave but won't tell anyone where I'm going and since I don't remember it I don't know if I actually know or if I'm just trying to get away. When I'm in this state I scratch at the skin on my hands and arms and have caused some damage before. Other than that I hear whispering all the time, most of it is inaudible but sometimes I can hear what it's saying. I also hear people shouting at me, telling me to do stuff like throw myself in front of cars or into rivers or to slit my wrists, you know, general killing myself stuff. I also see shadows running around in my peripheral vision but I can't look directly at them. I'm paranoid that people talk about me or laugh at me in public. I constantly try to hear what people are saying so I can confirm if they are or not but I can't focus on sound very well. I saw a mental health nurse in January who I feel fobbed me off by telling my I was just stressed. I was no more stressed than at any other time and it's been going on for so long now. I'm scared to leave the house alone because I'm worried I'll have an episode and end up hurt or worse.</TEXT>

    <TITLE>My creepy ex, JJ</TITLE>
    <DATE>2020-04-26 17:57:04</DATE>
    <TEXT>My ex, JJ, was a creep. I was with him for 19 months, this happened around 2 months into the relationship just as he was starting to get controlling and it terrified me. It was 2am and I was in bed. I have super bad insomnia so I was just listening to youtube and scrolling through reddit, not expecting to sleep for at least a couple hours when I head a tap tap tap on my window. I assumed it was my cat so I called her name because she always mowed when she heard her name. It was silent and then tap tap tap. I turned my YouTube right down and called my cat again. I heard her meow in the bathroom and panicked. It wasn't her outside my window. Outside my window is the roof of an extension that was built. It slopes up to my window and can easily be climbed onto via my neighbours wood shed. At that point I know there was someone out there but I was too scared to look. I sent JJ a message about it but he was asleep so it sent but didn't deliver. The tapping kept happening. Roughly every 20 seconds there would be a tap tap tap and the scilence. It continued for about 45 minutes while I lay in bed just listening. I felt like I was stuck in bed, like if I came out from under the quilt then they would somehow get me. After an hour I realised it at stopped completly. I pulled myself from my bed and went to my kitchen where I could see the roof and I saw a pair of legs dangling over the edge, illuminated by a torch. I decided to give up with my room and I slept on the sofa with my cat that night. At least whoever's it was wouldn't know where I was. Next thing I know I'm waking up to my alarm. I go to turn it off and noticed that I have snapchats from JJ which is odd but not unheard of. They're from around 3:30am so probably just after I fell asleep. I opened the snaps and my stomach dropped. It was a photo of my bedroom window from the outside. Then one of legs dangling into my garden and then one of me, sleeping on the sofa, taken through the kitchen window. I messaged him asking what the fuck he was doing. I got a reply saying he'd come to check on me and chased a guy off from my house. At that point he had me convinced he could do no wrong and if I opposed him I was scared about what might happen so I just left it at that. From then on it happened a couple more times and everytime I just tried to ignore it but with the joy of hindsight I know I shouldn't of. I should've told someone or broken up with him but I was too scared of what he might do. I have a lot of stories about JJ, I might write some more. I've been considering putting it in a book somewhere but I'm not sure. I hope if anyone reads this then they enjoy it.</TEXT>

    <TITLE>My saviour Brian</TITLE>
    <DATE>2020-04-29 19:33:04</DATE>
    <TEXT>So around this time last year I was walking through the local 24hr supermarket at 2am. My boyfriend had decided he would like a bath so I offered to go out and grab some 'girly shit' for him (think bubbles, candles and facemasks). I was perusing the soaps when a guy came uncomfortably close behind me and whispered "I love your hair." I had bright pink hair at the time and often got compliments or disapproving stares so I just nervously laughed and said thanks before moving to a different aisle. I thought it was creepy but it was 2am on a Saturday so I assumed he was drunk or whatever and moved on. I noticed him kind of following me around the shop but put it down to him needing the same stuff as me as I'd gone to get chocolate and sourz. Typical Friday night stuff. As I'm walking to the self checkouts a hand reaches out of the aisle next to me and tugs me round by the hood. I'm face to face, less than 10cm away from the guy and he absolutely stank of weed. I panic, my arms are full and I don't want to drop and smash the bottle of alcohol I've picked up so I just freeze. "You're a little young to be buying alcohol, don't you think?" I just mumbled something back, terrified. "Maybe I should buy it for you. We can go sit an my van and have a drink, yeah?" I notice one of his hands (the one that isn't holding my shoulder) looks like he's getting something out of his back pocket. Then a screwdriver is being pointed at my face. I have tears starting to well up and I'm on the verge of a panic attack when, like an angle, Brian tackles the guy. Brian work nights on the customer service desk and he's known me since I was born. Not like a close family friend but enough to care about me. Brian has the guy on the floor and tells me he's called the police. He says they've got it all on camera and I can just take my stuff and go, he'll sort it with the managers. I left, thoroughly shaken up. I put all my stuff in my bag and call my boyfriend to meet me halfway when I walk back. I spoke to Brian again about two weeks later and he said the guy was on parole and ended back up in prison as well as being permanently banned from that store.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>19 Female 5'2 175lbs but losing weight. Fibromyalgia and chronic fatigue syndrome. 10mg amatryptaline daily. 20mg of propranolol around once a week. Co-codamol and ibuprofen near daily. I got an implant in July of 2017. Prior to that my periods were all over the place. Gone for months then back every two weeks and then gone again. It was a mess, not even clue could track it. As soon as I got the implant it all settled down into an almost perfect 28 day cycle but since November they've just gone haywire again. I had one in November, and then another and then one in December and January. None in February, two a week apart in March and none in April. It could be the fact I'm coming to the end of the implants effectiveness but I've read that they actually last 4 years but they reccomend you replace them every 3 to make sure they're as effective as they can be. I don't really want to go to the doctor if I don't have to because I'm really bad at going in alone but since COVID-19 is a thing I'd have to.</TEXT>

I didn't tell a single other person for weeks, by which time I was in deep denial about what happened and only opened up because I had been drinking. She should've done something. Listened to me or called the police or at the very least found someone else for me to talk to.

He is 1 year and 9 or 10 months, the pet shop wasn't quite sure on his age. For around a week he's been getting up in the middle of the day, wandering round and sleeping in random places, I thought I might be too hot as it has been warm so I moved him to a colder room and he still did it. He get up at night and just sits like a little orb in the corner. He's completly lost interest in regular food and mostly in fruit/veggies but will take bites. He will still eat yogurt drops (I know they're bad but I used them in tiny peices to train him). He is very docile when I pick him up and seems heavy. Not like he's fat but like when you pick up a sleeping cat and they're suddenly the weight of a small planet. He hasn't tried to bite me once in the past couple days which is very strange as he was always a nippy ham. He also shakes a lot. Like they do when they're cold but he's not cold. His left eye lid looks slightly droopy like it's always half closed. I think he can open it fully but he doesn't. He also hasn't been drinking much but I've been giving him cucumber so that might be why. Any ideas? I can't take him to the vet as most of them are closed because we're all on lockdown.</TEXT>

When I first lost hair I lost around a third of it over 2 days and decided to shave my head and then some twat decided to tell everyone that I had cancer. Someone even tried to set up a GoFundMe for me to buy wigs. People can be awful but the best way to combat it is to try and educate them. Don't scream and shout and make a fuss.

There is a difference between manipulating someone and holding a mirror up to them. Showing someone that it's going to be okay is not manipulating them but I'm not here to argue the definition of what is and isn't manipulation. I'm here to understand how the hell you think this is healthy. I think you have some problems you need to address in your own time before you even attempt to enter a relationship.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>For context, I'm in England. My neightbor has always 'looked after' his garden. It looks relatively nice but a few years back he buried 3 mattresses under the back lawn and started dumping his rubbish at the back. Over the past few years the rubbish pile got bigger and bigger and now looks like [this](https://imgur.com/a/ajvTaxk) with a fence and trees to hide it. He lives in a council house and I'm fairly sure he isn't allowed to do that, especially since ih very watched him dump pain out of tins onto the pile which can't be very food for the environment. Is there any way I can report this? And who would I report it to? His missus has gotten into shouting matches with the young couple over the back when they complained about the rubbish pushing their fence over.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I'm my experience my fish needed a lot more care than my hamsters because they get sick easier and water changes are a lot more work than cleanin GB out a hamster. I've owned hamsters since I was 11 and cared for them completly by myself besides having help to clean them because the cages were to big for me to do alone. I feel like hamster care is often over complicated to a ridiculous point where it would be near impossible for anyone to own them. Granted I wouldn't let someone under 10 own one without help but I wouldn't let them own any pet without help. My local pet store sells them at 6-8 weeks and any older than that get moved to the adoption area rather than the hamster display. So all the hams you can buy are babies.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Honestly, him doing that will reflect worse on him than you. You're friends probably won't care about the photos so much as how disgusting of a human he is. I've had revenge porn sent to me. I kept it as evidence and encouraged my friend to go to the police. His ex got some sort of charge and a restraining order preventing him from contacting my friend or any of my friends friends or family. If your friends or family treat you any differently after seeing your intimate photos then they're the problem, not you. And they need to reevaluate their own lives.</TEXT>

If there is genuinly nothing then move to palliative care. Make your ham as comfortable as possible, keep food and water near their bed so they don't have to wander around too much, try not to bother them too much and if you need to moved them to a smaller environment.</TEXT>

Here I am, 5 years later. I don't regret trying because if i hadn't I would likely have a much different outlook on life. That night I made peace with my death and I still have that now. I will die and that is okay, I just need to do my best to stay alive for as long as I can to make sure the people around me are okay.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I found a grave in my local grave yard for 1 day old twins. It broke my heart. Googled their names out of curiosity and their mother had an entire blog about being antivax and she talked about not giving her twins the vitamin K shot when they were born and how the doctor obviously snuck it into them because they both died. She also uploaded autopsy reports claiming they were fabricated because both twins died of massive brain bleeds due to lack of vitamin K. It hurt me to read it. Hurt me even more to know that she had 3 more kids taken from her after that because she refused to treat a genetic problem two of them had with anything other than chiropractic adjustment. People make me sick.</TEXT>

He's learned that tube = play time but it gives him a choice. If he doesn't want to come out he will just stare at me like "wtf is this madman trying to do?" But if he does want to come out he wiggles his tiny butt into the tube, gets lifted out and then waddles around my bed for a while.</TEXT>

    <DATE>2020-05-26 16:43:24</DATE>
    <TEXT>Guinea pig is Tash. She is approximately 3 and has been living alone for 1.5 years. Tash has had a large cyst on the right side of her head but it is drained regularly, antibiotics didn't help. For around 4.5 months Tash's head had tilted to the right. Vet said it was likely due to the cyst, drained it again and said it was nothing to worry about. As of 2 months ago she has started falling. She will fall onto her right side and sometimes can't get up for 2 or 3 minutes without help. Some days she'll only fall once or twice, some days she'll wedge herself into a corner to she can stay up right. Eating and drinking fine, she's had 2 rounds of meta cam but it didn't help anything and getting it into her was stressful for all parties so we decided to stop there. What could this be?</TEXT>

    <DATE>2020-06-02 00:35:42</DATE>
    <TEXT>I've known Hannah since we were 3. My family moved in next door to hers and we've been friends since. We were close. We went to nursery, primary and secondary school together. A few months after I dropped out of school, so did she (unrelated) and we went to the same tuition centre. Over the years we've drifted apart and come together countless times but today I finally called it. We drifted apart in college because we were at separate campuses but she still came over to chat a few times a month. She would mostly talk about her self. Complain about things going on in her life, brag about how good she was doing at school. Then it came to a head one day when she insulted me for my choice of boyfriend. I flipped. My boyfriend was there for me in my lowest time, he stopped me killing myself, he would drop everything and run across town to comfort me when I was having a panic attack or when i was dissociating. Things Hannah didn't even care enough to know about. I'd tried to tell her I was having a hard time but she just told me shut up or talked over me. At that point I just stopped trying. She started uni last september and I've seen her once since. All she did was talk about how great her life was and wouldn't let me speak. She didn't care to know and now neither do it. Tonight I told her to go fuck herself. If she doesn't care about me then I don't care either. I told her that I can do without her constant bragging and complaining. That I have enough shit on my plate without her. I'm done. 16 years of friendship and I'm done with her. I still care deeply about her family, just not her. I feel really good about this but also like I've made a huge mistake. I don't know what to do now.</TEXT>

    <DATE>2020-06-02 03:20:51</DATE>
    <TEXT>CW: THIS POST CONTAINS EXPLICIT INFORMATION ABOUT MY SEX LIFE AND SOME OF THE ABUSE I SUFFERED RELATING TO THAT. My ex conditioned me that squirting was bad. He would slap me, take my clothes and open all the windows if I did. He'd pour water on me and leave me in his room for sometimes over an hour to "see how I liked it". It conditioned me and now everytime I squirt I start to panic. My boyfriend is amazing about it and looks after me, he doesn't care if we have to stop sex as long as I'm okay. How do I get past this conditioning? I can't stand panicking everytime I squirt. My boyfriend loves when I do it but I'm always so scared.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>It isn't vaginismus as far as I know since I can be completly relaxed and still have problems. I've tried more foreplay, a butt ton of various types of lube and 'stretching' with toys before hand but no matter what I do it's still very tight and often kinda painful and I get a lot of micro tears from even the most gentle sex. My boyfriend is fairly well endowed but still writhing the realms of normal honestly I'm at a bit of a loss. Sorry if this isn't overly detailed, feel free to ask any questions. I'm not very good at asking for help or organising my thoughts.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>On the twitter point, I once replied to a 'black people Twitter' post and the poster had a massive rant at me in DMs because I was white and therefore not allowed to speak on black issues? They were talking about make up and accessorising and stuff, all I did was suggest a good brand of nail polish. I could understand if they were talking about black hair care or something like that since I have ridiculously straight hair but it was nail polish. Not long after I deleted twitter all together for unrelated reasons but them and their friends telling me off really just made me feel like I couldn't talk to black people as a whole in case I offended them. I know now they were irrational but 13y/o me was shook at the time.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I remember him being white on the cover of the DS game, as does my boyfriend. Also it's compeltly normal to imagine people to be your race pr the race of people you grew up around unless you know otherwise. I picture people as white because I grew up as a white person in a predominantly white community, if I were a black person in a predominantly black community I'd probably picture people as black since that's what I'd be used to.</TEXT>
