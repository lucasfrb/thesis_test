    <TITLE>My (F24) Gf (F27) is having serious mental health issues and I don't know how else to help</TITLE>
    <DATE>2019-04-03 10:50:04</DATE>
    <TEXT>My partner is in a very bad place right now. She hates her job to the point she wakes up with anxiety attacks everyday. We are very dependent on her salary so quitting without something lined up isn't an option. I've been fighting with her to seek help for over a year. We are in the process of finding a counselor but I fear she needs help at this very moment. We suspect she my have borderline personality disorder. Her rage and anxiety is unbearable. She feels hopeless, stuck and sucicidal. Her family isn't very supportive and she has a history of trauma. Are there any resources we can try? I'm trying to avoid over night treatment upon her request.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I think so too. And sometimes I drink and drink and never feel drunk. Especially with wine. I don't think their system is very fair. I think they need to go by BMI like the doctors. And maybe have more thorough or better tests. Like obviously if you smell a bunch of alcohol and they just hit a tree yeah that's a DUI.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I disagree. If it's outside of the school and isn't harming anyone you shouldn't be expelled for it. I could see if they found a picture of her doing blackface last Halloween. Or even if her shirt said I'm gay and I hate Jesus. But just for liking rainbows? That is very ridiculous and definitely deserves to be here. Do you have freedom of speech outside of school and you shouldn't be in trouble for how you express yourself outside of the classroom.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Yup. That's a thing. But science changes. Gender doesnt mean what it means in 1856. Things have changed. Gender doesnt = genitals anymore. Sex = genitals and I'm sure people who are intersex appreciate that. People with body dismorphia deserve to have what they need to be more comfortable and treated for their illness whether its top surgery or rehab for an eating disorder. I think more research needs done as things are changing so quickly. As i go through college its changing. Both sides need to realize that.</TEXT>

Being a parent your choices are harder but you still have to keep your happiness in mind. No child wants their parent to be unhappy. There are choices we make that children don't understand yet but needs to be done. "Mom i don't want to go to grandma's today. Her house smells." "Well mommy needs a break so, sorry". There's obvi bigger decisions we make but your kid isn't going to like every choice you make.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>It is as simple as trying. It's not recommended to just take antidepressants, you're supposed to work on your depression too. I have a therapist and I also practice all of my mindfulness everyday to get better at it. I'm much better than when I was at 18 at 25. If you haven't even tried, how do you know...? If other people's opinions and how they think about you or making you depressed or ruining your life, then this is exactly what you need to read to help you with that.</TEXT>

All that does is teach people to afraid of the police, who are here to serve and PROTECT. Why in God's name would tell you they have a gun just to whip it out and start shooting? Maybe a mentally ill person, but how would they get a gun? No logic or thought is being used. If rhats how they're trained, then no wonder a large majority of people dont like cops!! I personally have not had issues with my local authority. That's doesn't mean others haven't. You cannot excuse tragedies because they only happened to some people.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I agree unless you have an open concept. Then the first floor is pretty much being filmed at all times. Some people have cameras in the nursery too or the kids play rooms. It seems creepy but kids will just scream and make noises like something is wrong when there isn't. It's nice to just look over at your phone and see they're okay instead of sprinting up the stairs.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I did but maybe I didn't explain it very well. I do just assume I'm being watched. I assume I'm being watched in public too. However once you are comfortable in a home you can easily forget you are being watched. You're not disclosing passwords. You are telling a guest in your home you are watching them. If your child care provider is aggressive and you see them hurting your child on the camera yes you can address that. However, they might have thought twice about hurting them if they knew they were being watched. You don't want to wait for them to hurt your kid before you let them know there's cameras. Cameras might actually protect your kid. Any parent can tell you it's not hard to mess up picking your kid up, raising your voice, etc. Kids suck a lot of times and some people aren't built to care for them.</TEXT>

I miss story mode in general. Bustin Out was my first sims game i owned to myself and LOVED it. I still think about Mimi!! Also i would make infants different. More stuff for their rooms, strollers, baby food in the high chair, story time, and tummy time. And i want toddlers to be more cute and less annoying (irl too would be nice). As a console user I want to be able to have access to mods that aren't really mods. Maybe once a month release a "mod" for purchase. Only for that month. Pay the original mod creator and sell it back to console. I've only played on console and i get so jealous at all thr shit PC can do.</TEXT>

I'm saying celebrating slave owners is horrible. They shouldn't be on our money, they shouldn't have holidays, and they should always be talked about in the proper light. If you owned people to do things for you, I don't care if you represented a new democracy. That democracy was only for a very small group of people. All the brown people on that land. No freedoms, had no vote in any matter, and definitely get ignored on President's Day. Which is during Black History Month. Talk about a slap in the face</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I still think if you owned people, raped, or a pedophile, anything good you do should go out the door. Those cancel everything out. I'm okay with canceling all of those people. I understand taking the good with the bad. But I think if people are still suffering from the aftermath of slavery, you should probably do what you can to make it right. And creating holidays and putting their faces on money isn't one of them. I think people should think about George Washington owning slaves. If you don't want to repeat history why sugarcoat it? I'm sure if you went back in time and asked those slaves if they wanted art or their freedom, they're going to choose freedom. I understand everything happens for a reason, or the significance of bad things that include things in motion. But I don't think we're doing anyone any Justice by having a George Washington day, or having any slave owners being glorified in any way possible.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Honestly she tripped out on her first. And brought it to social media first. I think I just come from a different culture with different friends. We take a lot of pride in our double chin pictures, and our stomachs being a little out. I've never had to ask a friend if it was okay to post a picture. And when we take pictures, they don't like it, we delete it right then and there because we just say "ew lets take another." We've NEVER went off on each other because they posted a picture before editing it. I think the whole thing is silly. I understand why the woman with body dismorphia is upset, that's her disorder. My wife has a friend who never takes pictures because she hates the way she looks, and she's the most beautiful person in the world. She only recently started taking pictures because we showed her filters. So I get it, but I just can't relate.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Absolutely. I have a hug binder filled with many different coping mechanisms, mantras, advice, resources/helplines, etc. Im sure something in there is bound to help someone out but i am not licensed to just tell people what will for sure work for them. And some things only help sometimes. Masturbating is a great and productive way to cheer yourself up and keeping your mind away from intrusive thoughts. But that doesn't always work and you can't do that everywhere unless you want to be arrested. Constant care by a medical professional is ideal. Advice is advice, take it at your own risk.</TEXT>

If you are a person of color you have every right to generalize police as we are often the victims. I personally have never had an issue with the police but I'm still terrified because I KNOW if they want to hurt me they can. You've never been more aware of your hands until you are black and around police. When cops face real consequences for their actions and change how they think on the job then we will stop generalizing.</TEXT>

If you are interested in finding out more about yourself please talk to YOUR doctor and even do research for a better doctor if you feel yours isnt helpful.

I would like to see a good name play Sophia Lamb and her daughter Eleanor. You could get away with it because in the 60's poc were defintley more accepted (vs 1940). BUT Johnny Topside being a deep sea diver nobody misses? Sounds like a black man in America to me. A psychologist whose ideas were rejected on the surface and wants to come for a rich white man? Sounds like a determined black woman to me. Tennebuam can stay super German but Bioshock 1 German. That good good German.</TEXT>

I am 6ft and 260lbs. I would basically be drinking water and eating extremely small meals. I do not look as heavy as I am because that's just how I'm built lol. Ladies cut yourself some slack because we have more fat then men, and men have more muscle. I think a lot of scales go by the average man and male doctors don't like to say "yes you have big thighs/ass/breasts and thats okay you're still healthy." Of course you're going to weigh more when you are blessed</TEXT>

    <TEXT>It is a source. It is human biology. Sugar amd carbs serve a purpose in your body. It is something we all (should've) learned in high school. You can look it up, ask a doctor or a biology teacher. Ketosis is your body saying "I'm hungry, i would like carbs please". When you are hungry, especially for long period of time there are side effects. You are mostly losing water weight and some carbs when you are on the keto diet. You can Google this easily by just typing "ketosis", nothing else to create bias.</TEXT>

And if you actually scroll down the recipes in the comments you will see most people at extra butter and extra sugar. I think most Bakers do the minimum of fat and sugar to give people the freedom to add more, but basically giving you the minimum. Usually adding a little more butter and a little more sugar doesn't mess up the recipe at all. Most of the time it's going to enhance it.</TEXT>

If I wanna fuck 40 people safely and find the love of my life the next day why should i feel ashamed? I understand everyone has their morals but this seems like the kinda talk that turns people off from living their truths and being honest. When entering long term relationships you should lay out what you want and what you like. The kind of person you want to spend your life with. It's the other persons repsposiblity to say "hey, I'm not that kind of person. I had a past and if that bothers you we should talk about it now." Ya know, like adults.</TEXT>

I can agree coming up with conspiracies because you don't like the outcome is silly. However, I can understand how someone feels that way. I feel cheated too. I'm not trying to validate the theories, just saying maybe. I don't know how the video game industry works but I know how hard it is to make money AND keep your employees AND the consumer happy. I think most elections are rigged anyway. How do you know they didn't mess with something? I don't think it's that important and its just an interesting thought. Some people are more passionate about it. I appreciate your kindness and upvoted your comment. Console play is all I know, so i try to stay humble.

    <TEXT>Certain ages do no understand it at all. Hence why they are so clingy to a stuffed animal. From their perspective, their world is over. They are lost, broken. It's not just a toy. It's comforting. Plenty of kids use lovies to help them soothe and cope. Can you imagine losing that? Your entire world is turned upside down. It's not an overreaction at all. You can teach them things are temporary, but at certain ages in certain ways. We all want our kids to be tough but they are still just kids.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Though this is sweet, Society likes Beauty. We are ignorant to say beauty doesn't dictate some aspects of our lives. And some people definitely enjoy being sexy and having attention. And I don't think there's anything wrong with it. Some people enjoy being sexual objects under their own control. This is for those women who are overweight and feel like they can't have that.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I'm not saying we should be fine with it. But it's definitely something that's not going away anytime soon. And I feel like it's ignorance to tell women not to worry about it. You should have confidence in yourself and love yourself and matter what. I'm not really surprised a positive post for fat girls it's going to be picked apart. But coming from another woman is surprising. My standard did you find comfortability and yourself and what it means to be you. And if it means you're a fat b**** you like sending nudes to people that good for you. Some women enjoy being really feminine and taking a lot of time to look nice. There's something wrong with them? Everyone defines their femininity and Beauty differently. Don't police it. Society dictates women should be skinny but I just made a whole post about how you don't have to be. You wanted to come in here with all women and that's not what it is even was about. All women get recognized all day. But fat women get scrutinized.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I'm sex positive. If somebody wants to have sex and it makes them feel good they should. As long as everyone is consenting adults I don't think it's a big deal. I think it's empowering for women to use their sexuality to get what they want and have control. I'm a sexual abuse Survivor. I love having control over my body and being sexy on my terms. Is that not okay with you? Is that not acceptable? Is that harmful? Because I feel great. And my therapist thinks it's great too. Sex is not this big dirty thing. And women taking control their sexuality isn't harmful. Men and sometimes other women, taking advantage of their sexuality is the problem. People like to be sexual beings. We're all not prudes.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>You can but we can go into my rape and stuff too. My post is to let fat women know that they are a fantasy. Maybe you've never experienced being overweight but a big issues feeling like no one is attracted to you I don't think it's unreasonable to for people to want to be attractive. I want to be wanted. And it was reassurance for them that they are wanted. If you would like to take that away from them go ahead doesn't seem very feminist to me. I don't understand why bad girls can't have a shout-out post about their sexuality. You talk about straws and I feel like you're really going for straws. No one is confident 24/7. Even the most confident people have bad days where they feel like they're not attractive. Do they need the insurance. I'm not saying a woman should care about what men think but if they do wonder if they're attractive, that they are attractive. I even put that I switched teams and I'm gay and happily married and don't want men. What might be the last person to encourage women to degrade themselves for the pleasure of men?</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I got you: Seek support from loved ones and try to access resources that can better serve your mental health. If you don't have much money and a bundle of illness (like myself) state programs exist and depending on where you are from they are helpful. If you aren't getting the help you need please keep trying to find the right doctors for you! Took me 4 years to find a good counselor. Do not be afraid of medication. If it's not working out you might need something else. Or a lower dose and more/different therapy. It is not easy to rid yourself of depression. Solutions are hard but if you're tired of being depressed you and only you can change that. As a person whose had a long history with mental health and abuse: I do not accept not trying as a reason to coddle you. Ignorance and lack of resources is one thing. But to say "I'm depressed and I'm not going to do anything about it ever" is literally crazy. Obvi from case to case this changes. If you are so sad you cannot bathe and dress yourself every day and you get bullied for it, you need serious help. Lack of hygiene is a symptom of depression. People have to be around you and you stink. They will react. That is life. Take a shower before you leave the house or dont! We've all been there but we're all not using it as an excuse. No matter how nice it would be, no one is bending for your illness. You learn to cope, not the other way around.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I agree. However, sometimes the solution is simple but getting to it is hard. I think you missed where i said I suffer from a mental illness. I literally said go to a doctor and find the right treatment. I am not a doctor but am training in the mental health field. Being aware is one thing but it's another to expect people to change for YOU. YOU need to change. YOU need to learn to cope. We can only ask the public to be aware and be patient. If you are doing nothing you cannot expect people to baby you. You have the right to be ill and not seek treatment but no one is allowed to judge you for it? That's not fair. Take care of yoself and put some effort into it and people will be more willing to be understanding. You don't wake up and be better. It takes YEARS and practice. I'm still going to therapy and have meds I will take until i die. It's my responsibility to take care of myself for the sake of my family and the public.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Maybe just take a social media break for awhile. Or refrain from posting and commenting for a week or so. Just be an observer and try to filter out any negative triggers/feelings/topics. People can be mean, however you get to decide if their time was wasted. Do some things you enjoy. If you are having trouble getting started or nothing seems fun, I recommend masturbating/nap/a shave/ anything to get you moving or feeling better about yourself.

    <TEXT>You have to change your situation. That's literally the first step to change is TRYING. Trying is doing. Its all about perspective and mindset. My wife hates it when i say "it's gonna be okay." How? Because I'm going to make it okay. If something is wrong, fix it. Doesn't mean it'll be easy or quick. You have control. If you feel you don't, your focus should be how to feel like you have control. Being negative and complaining will do nothing for you. Especially if you are seeking support. Worrying is natural and good. There are things to worry about. Learn to cope and change things that are in your power to change. Complaining ain't it.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I didn't say it could be. I'm sorry you are going blind. If you cannot change it, you have to learn to cope. You can complain but it won't change anything or help your spirits. Everyone has their problems and difficulties. You can learn to cope or be depressed forever. It's your vessle, you chose how you spend your limited amount of time on Earth. I obvi don't know your options for preventing/slowing down the process but I can imagine it's hard to deal with regardless. My only advice is to give yourself time to grieve and be upset. I personally tell myself "I'm going to feel my feelings for ___ amount of time and then after that I'm going to learn how to deal with it." Work on not letting it run your life. You run the show.</TEXT>

I disagree that people on reddit think it's more common than it is. I think you might be confusing their frustrations. It is common and people of color have seen time and time again that they should for sure be afraid of law enforcement. I think Redditors are upset it keeps happening and no one is doing anything about it. Just because it's not common in your world doesn't mean it's not common to the rest of the world. Just because i don't have bad experiences with police doesn't mean other people don't. It is not my place to downsize their complaints.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I think it just depends, as a parent. I read where the child bought stuff with his money. I'm not okay with that. If my son bought something, its his and i can't take it away unless it causes harm. For all we know he did have chances to improve. If she didn't give him a chance then that sucks. I don't expect any parent to be passive when it comes to education. Children donr understand how important it is and sometimes parents do things they might regret to prove a point. All i can say if my son started slipping in school I'm for sure taking away distractions. It's not mean, kids just don't get it.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>As a person who has lost a lot loved ones to addiction, it's hard to be empathetic. They hurt you constantly. I know they cant help it/sick/don't mean it but it doesn't take away the hurt they cause. I acknowledge the causes however with all the pain, it's hard to feel bad. My best friends mom is raising my cousins 4 year old. No real relation, just taking care of a random kid since birth. My horrible father died from driving intoxicated. It bothers me people feel bad for them, even though it's all a result of their choices. I guess what I'm trying to say is I think people are unempathetic because the pain the addicts cause makes it hard to be that way. I hope your recovery is going well though!</TEXT>

    <TITLE>YSK: Not to excuse your teen's emotions because they're "hormonal."</TITLE>
    <DATE>2020-05-28 11:30:21</DATE>
    <TEXT>We as parents, are not doctors. We are only guessing that the hormones are running wild that day and that's what wrong. We cannot look into out child's brain and say "ah yes, testosterone is up there today." Hormones suck, us women know this first hand. However, assuming it's hormones is a great way to ignore the bigger picture. Middle school and high school seem so long ago, so we forgot about all the drama and bullying and simple bs teenage angst that was there. Girls are getting fatter while the boys thin out and get taller. Girls get a littler meaner, a little more self conscious. Boys start to smell, get self concious, start thinking about dating, etc. Those concerns are real and impact their lives. If you woke up every day feeling fat, like no one likes you, school is hard, you would be emotional too. Some mental illnesses develop in early teen and young adult years. Don't ignore signs of illness because they're going through puberty. Try to talk to your children and even consider a therapist/mentor to help guide them through the rough patch. Yes, hormones are a factor but don't make up as much of the problem as you think. It's easy to ignore them and say they'll get over it. But ask yourself, is that what YOU needed at this time?</TEXT>

Even if you had two they do not want to do it. My mother and sister almost died during birth and they STILL gave my mom shit. "What if you met George Clooney and he wanted kids?" My mom told the nurse he's rich enough to adopt his own lol. Not sure if it will help with PCOS. I asked to get my ovaries removed and they said no because it will weaken my bones sooner than necessary. Birth control has been my friend.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Honestly I feel the same way. I have a counselor who advocates for me and reaches out to doctors when I'm not able to. I do know that there isn't as much info on PCOS as we need to be able to do more about the symptoms. My endocrinologist kept it real with me about everything, especially the facial hair. Straight told me to save up for laser removal as it's the only thing that is proven to help, every time. The meds take years to work and it's not guaranteed to work. It hurt to hear as my chin and stache make me hate my face, but I need the honesty. Don't have me chasing dreams.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>And I appreciate our due processes. If you ever watch interrogations and courtroom video from other countries even First World countries, it makes you appreciate our checks and balances. However, we have a really sad history of not disciplining these murderers correctly. I could understand everyone's frustration if this was a one-time incident. the black community has been shown time and time again that we can be killed by the police and little to nothing will be done. I don't think it's unreasonable for me to want more from them. I think they need trained for much longer than what they are. I think they need to be adverse in the law and sociology. And throwing some Mental Health education to. Learn how to handle people who are aggressive because of their illness, not because they actually want to hurt people. A lot of people with mental illness have lost their lives to the police because they just didn't know what to do with them.</TEXT>

Hot oil treatments and wonderful too. Some people like egg and mayo with a shower cap. I reccomend moisturizing then braiding it if it's long enough.

    <TEXT>Hello. I want to start off by saying you're not alone. I have said everything you've told me and my wife is going through something similar now. It seems like you need a different therapist. Sometimes talking or help in general isn't the help you want, but it's the help you need. Sometimes we have to feel our feelings, figure them out, and THEN deal with them. I'm sorry about your cat. The stages of grief aren't linear. You're going to feel lots of things at different times. Meditation is scientifically proven to help with anxiety. You seem anxious. Meditation is it causing you to relive bad events, that's PTSD. Your brain is so overworked Will trauma you can't even take a moment to yourself. I think you could benefit from EMDR therapy. Talk to your therapist about it. The second to last paragraph reminds me of myself before I found out I had bipolar disorder. I would recommend talking to a doctor about being screened for a mental illness. And sometimes we lash out because we don't know how else to communicate was going on within ourselves. And therapy is supposed to help with that too. Depending on your age and where you live now how controlling your mom is, you have more control over your health than what you think. At any time you have a private moment with your doctor please take advantage of it and tell them the truth about your situation and let them help you. You can even tell them that you want a new doctor oh, no offense, and your mother isn't helping you find one. Our doctors, counselors, social workers, therapists are supposed to advocate for us. That is their jobs. If they are not advocating for you they are not doing their jobs.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>God I'm happy I filter out my IG friends and stay away from Twitter. Those people are crazy. I definelty appreciate law and order in my society. I can agree that I'm not following anything that would talk about it, especially because the focus is the riots and protests. And yes, some people need an excuse to be assholes. I Remember in high school when there was fights and all of the staff is focused on the fights, and it was opportunity for people to sneak out of school or just do whatever. It's kind of happening now. I think if a certain amount of cops are focused on downtown, and the rest just kept on keeping everybody safe maybe the riots wouldn't be so bad. But I don't know. I have no idea how the cops work. I just feel like taking hundreds of police officers and putting them down town where people are trying to be peaceful isn't protecting the people who are being looted. I understand there have to be cops there because there's a lot of people, but I just wish some of the officers were helping with the Looting. I keep seeing videos of people looting and I don't see a single cop. This is why I appreciate the police. Their job is supposed to be to keep us safe. I don't think any of the residents feel safe right now.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I don't I think you understand what they're trying to say. To sit back and watch someone be awful makes you awful. There's literally a law that says if you are there during the commission of a crime and do nothing to stop it you also committed the crime. The cops should be held to that as well. If you let your fellow officers commit crimes and be horrible officers, you are also a horrible officer. You're letting bad things happen even though you have the power to stop them. If you watch a little girl get the shit beat out of her by a grown man and do nothing, you're just as bad as that grown man. We raised our son to always stick up for the smaller person. They're not protecting and serving if they cannot protect us from their fellow officers. I see a lot where people want to argue about what the other person would want to do. Instead of saying what you think is the best approach. If you don't like the protesting, which is how people are trying to help, then what do you suggest? Because it seems like you have an issue with what people are trying to do.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>From what I've seen of the protest because I watched most of them live, a lot of the officers are not engaging in any of that. As we all know elections are money base. A lot of people who genuinely care cannot afford to be on a ballot. And the ones that can be on the ballot are usually met with resistance and don't have as much power as we want them to have. I don't think violence solves every problem. But if violence didn't solve anything we wouldn't spend trillions of dollars towards Wars. And when you hear f*** the police, it's these police. If we had good police, nobody would say f*** them. I mean maybe some criminals but that's about it. Everybody wants Law and Order we just want it from the right people. And asking everybody to be quiet and do things according to the system isn't fair because the system is whats killing people. If you have something more detailed and that could help people who are ignorant to it, I think you should do your best to spread the word.</TEXT>

My hair is thick, with tighter curls and at this time it's thinning out and I'm losing more than usual, but not big clumps. I'm hoping its just the hair cycle and nothing permanent. I'm at the age where it's about time to lose some old hair and grow new. Try not to slick back and pony tails and avoid brushes and finger comb. It helps a lot. Vitamin E oil has been extremely helpful keeping my hair ans scalp healthy during this sad time for my luscious hair.

    <TEXT>I live not too far away from there. It really isn't that bad. People on here like to shit on areas they've never been to, or have nothing to compare it to. A lot of people are reporting shootings that are just fireworks. Car breaks in happen alkost everywhere. You'll be in a home, not an apartment so it's even less likely. It's just kids checking doors. I know because when schools got shut down it got worse. They don't break windows. Just lock your doors or park in the garage. People seem to forget that smart theives travel up the money so no one is truly safe.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I see, thank you for the clarification. To me, I think about it like i think about my PTSD. Getting rid of triggers and dealing with the trauma is easier when I'm more educated about the event and learn how over come it. I can't overcome anything if there's pictures of my abusers everywhere. So we're educated about CC, and trying to overcome the damage he left behind. I also think it makes a statement to society that we see we made mistakes but we will no longer glorify them.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Personally, I think they need more training and better screenings for an abundance of personality related red flags. I think the hiring process should be in depth. I want to know where each officer is in a personality evaluation. I want to know if you have any mental illnesses especially PTSD. I want THEM to be trained on how to help others who suffer from an illness. I want there to be officers who are unarmed patrolling and answering certain calls. I don't think every single officer needs a gun 24/7. I'm not against all guns, just time and place. About defunding: idfk okay? Idk how that works with what I personally want from the police. All I know is the police department is attracting a certain type of person and they need out. I know I want better services for POC and the mentally ill. I think the police SHOULD be this big respectful union of strong people who have the passion to protect and serve its people. However, they do not do that and the public doesnt trust them. They need a complete overhaul of everything.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Interesting thought. My counter thought: it's the toxic masculinity that does that. Also, boys are treated like kids for awhile and then BAM without warning, they're men. No more mommy, your grown now with no transition. Society (sometimes not meaning to) treats men unfairly with growing up and "becoming a man." No more crying. No emotions. Anything challenging that is ~gay~. It's about what defines YOU as a "man." I tell my son, a man is a protector, kind, strong, happy, honest, and loving. Everything else is just a hobby (lifting weights, drinking, etc). Raising your kids in a more androgynous environment will prevent them from over analyzing their gender.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I'm a nanny, I wouldn't really talk back to my boss unless he was doing something to put his own kids in danger. I don't think it's right to just "follow orders" unless there's no harm. If I tell my son to stop jumping off his bed, I don't need his opinion on that. Now if I tell him to not wear his seat belt, not only is that worth the discussion but he would have the right to question it. I think being told things are changing to keep people safe are worth looking into to make sure they're safe, and if it's safe it is what it is. It's not safe to tear gas people.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Unfortunately you can't tell oppress people how to go about demanding change. You can't say "be mad, but only in a way that the rest of the world is okay with". I mean you can, but it's not going to be heard. I'm not the type of person who want to abolish police and understand their importance. My perspective is, fear is why they are all being treated the same. Which seems ironic since black people feel we all get treated like criminals even though that's not true. Anyway, enough are fucking up to the point where its hard to tell whose evil and who isn't. My cousin is a Sherrif in a smaller county in Ohio. He's a good guy. Sucks people treat him like hes not. But he understand why and understands it's HIS people causing these issues. The public is just reacting.</TEXT>

At this point, protestors are being ignored and slandered in the news. The police just look worse and worse. Yes they shouldnt be in the street but they're not being violent so it's unnecessary to react with violence. Work with the protestors, reroute traffic, don't cause physical harm.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>You say borrowing, I say stealing from our culture. White people love to say they're borrowing or appreciating culture as they get paid tons of money to do things black people are doing and get paid little to nothing forward. That's my problem. There were so much better musicians and dancers than Elvis at that time but people only talk about Elvis. F***. Elvis.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Obviously I wasn't alive to know personally or know them personally. But my grandparents were. And they were black. And they have a lot to say about Elvis as they lived through that time. My rap is at Elvis as it should be. He was a grown man that should have known better. It gets really frustrating when people try to defend racism, cultural appropriation, and ignorance, I'm not saying Elvis was this horrible person. But at the end of the day he stole from black people. And there's plenty of black people out there that don't realize someone is being racist or inappropriate. We can get so used to abuse we don't even realize it's happening anymore. And trust me, the music industry is very good about that</TEXT>

I am a fan of Dolly, Cash, etc. It's not the music per say. I disagree about him being the best, but that could be a musical taste issue. I wanna say the charts are what they are, but is that just white people had a say in the manner? I hate to sound like a conspiracy theorist, I really do.

I like glasses and without glasses. I like bigger lenses on me because smaller lenses takes away from my eyes (my favorite feature that i try to highlight). Also, glasses might look better with your hair up or down. Just see what you prefer. I prefer my hair up with glasses because my eyes brows are arched and it adds angles. I dont think you need to beat your face or anything like that at all. These subtle changes will seem drastic and work for you really well. I think your hair just needs something new.</TEXT>

For me personally the hardest thing to deal with is the facial hair. It's not as bad as others but it just makes me self-conscious. I don't have interest in having children so I'm not worried about infertility like many of us are.

You can change your eyebrow shape to easily be more comfortable with that. A lot of men aren't for eyebrow care but they dont have to be super arched or anything at all, and it really cleans you up. I LOVE your hair. You have a nice texture, embrace it. Maybe taper the sides and give it a good shape. I'm not sure if gaining weight will help your eye, but it might! I gain weight on my face easiest through dairy products.</TEXT>

Someone said ditch the glasses because of clutter, you don't really have to do that. Slimming down your brows will add less clutter. I like wearing bigger glasses so you can actually see my makeup. But when I wear contacts you can see my makeup fine. So I just keep my eyebrows on a thinner side when I'm wearing my glasses more. Bushier eyebrows and big glasses tend to make your face look cluttered. But I've seen more people make their blush or Contour a certain way where it's not noticeable.</TEXT>

Duh my cheeks aren't this red. Don't think I'm cute without it? Go fuck yourself. You lose confidence once it's off if you're not a confident person. I'm pretty comfortable with myself natural and still feel way more confident when I beat my face. If you ONLY like yourself when you wear make up, it's time to tell to someone like a therapist or a confidence coach.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I do NOT think we are hardwired to find fat people unattractive. Maybe in the western world, but not humanity. I would look at the mass amount of videos on porn sites labeled "BBW." I'm from the Midwest so its common to see fat and skinny people together. Skinny people here are just fat people with a better metabolism. We all eat. It SEEMS like thinner people get ahead, because we let them. I don't. I don't let my weight dictate how my life goes. I can do anything an average person can do + some lol. I cant speak for others, but I'm sure I'm not a unicorn. I've seen a woman 3x my size carry an entire couch by herself. Being fat didn't stop her at all. I cannot stress this enough, I cannot be less than 200lbs. I am not built for that. At all. Not even a little. I would absolutely hate myself. I don't want to see my bones. In my community thin ain't it. I really appreciate your thoughts and advice either way!</TEXT>

If Beauty was a byproduct of good health, we wouldn't have Eating Disorders. Most people do not associate Health with beauty. Especially young girls who are told to drink tummy tea and stuff like that. I'm not saying everyone isn't coming from a good place, I personally just cannot do that. My goal is to always uplift people and encourage them to make changes that they're comfortable with. I haven't heard from her so I don't know how she feels about anything I'm saying. That is my concern with talking to underage individuals about their weight. It's not my place. And like I said before, she's going through puberty. She's going to be heavier.

I'm very active because of my jobs so I'm not pressed to work out 4x a week. I have an amazing relationship with my doctors who are also very happy with my weight. Cant argue with how my test results come back. At that point you're telling me to lose weight just to do it. I love the tidbit about less competition lmao. I enjoy your perspective on general.

    <TEXT>It's not blissful ignorance. I'm sorry your country is suffering. My advice is encouraging an under age girl to love herself and talk to her doctor? Do you understand how harmful social media has been to young women about their appearances? If you actually care, look into it. Look into tummy tea and its impact on young woman. Take an adolescent psychology class like I did and really understand how teenagers feel about themselves, and how harmful it is to tell them to lose weight as a stranger on the internet. This is coming from my experience, the exeperience of obese people around me, my education and critical thinking. I really hope you can gain some empathy and take some time to educate yourself.

    <TEXT>Very interesting thought. Yes, I did grow up bigger than my peers, and most of that time was due to height and not weight. I'm the type who doesn't want a private jet and crazy things. I'm very humble. I'm a mom, I want there things for my son. I work for that lol. I see and understand what you're saying. With who I am, how I was raised, my confidence level, my history with abuse, I know exactly how i want my body and how I want to be in control of it. I don't want you to think I think you're wrong, I don't and I agree. In the past I would've killed for that switch. I would've killed for the riches. Just not anymore. So many things are more important to me. My health is fine, I feel pretty. I don't like SOME things but not enough to hate myself, and work on them. I'm uncomfortable with others assuming every overweight person is the same, and disregarding mental health. Weight loss is complicated, I worry people down in the dumps will seek unhealthy ways to lose weight. I'm not against people being the best version of themselves, I want them to be in control of what that means to them.</TEXT>

I'm not discrediting any racism or Prejudice white people feel. But at this point in time, it's not about y'all. The imbalance of power alone is enough for me to just not want to waste my time with that. Growing up a black person makes it really, really, really, hard to feel bad.

Asking a black person to educate themselves on the hardships of white people is like asking a zebra to care about a Lions hungry belly. I'm trying to survive out here, lol. What do you know about being a black human? Or are you more worried about the trials of being a white person in America? I can totally be more engaged in a conversation if I saw what empathy and knowledge you have about being a black person in America.

Think about individuals who had to drop out to support their families and have no idea how to apply for a college loan. Think about the individuals who are taking care of their siblings who they already raised during their own childhood. Consider abusive parents. It is NOT equal opportunity. A lot of us never had a chance. I think society needs to support these individuals who were not afforded any support. Maybe those huge corporations could help in a way? Make it easier for people to work part time jobs and attend school and have an overall better society? Why not?</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I would try to have a serious discussion. My best friend of years still says I'm pan, when ive said plenty of times I'm just gay. I let it go, she doesn't mean any harm and it doesn't change my sexuality. If it bothers you and he truly is a good friend, please try to have a good convo. Explain how hurtful it is, explain how toxic it is to fuel that stereotype of bi people. I've had discussions with straight male friends about why men are obsessed with having sex with lesbians. He thinks it's because men feel they're being challenged, like their masculinity is being challenged. Not saying you need to take responsibility for how he feels, I would just keep it in mind. Maybe even let him know not to take it personal that lesbians don't want him anymore, might make him feel a little embarrassed.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Therapy helped me with these concerns. Talking it out, and hearing what your going through is normal makes for a peace of mind. I promise. It seems like you have symptoms of depression. Often when I'm depressed I don't have interest in things I usually do, or lose motivation to try new things. Practicing mindfulness will be helpful. To not care about what people think, this is what I do: I tell myself its none of buisness what goes on in someone's mind, and I evaluate how their judgment affects me, my family, and my future. Most of the time, it doesn't. Your taste in music doesn't change any of that. Someone doesn't like it? Okay, cool. I don't like a lot of shit either lol. People judge, we're wired to do it. You have to accept that. You may be doing to much at once. Routine is helpful. Try one new thing for 6 weeks, make it routine, and start something else after. Example: you want abs AND want to start jogging. First six weeks you get into a routine of 25 sit ups after breakfast. That's what you do for 6 weeks or until it's normal for you. After that, work on jogging. My best motivation is to just do it. I know it sounds dumb, but just do it. You'll whine, complain, but once it's over you'll feel better. Kinda like going to work. You rather play video games but you need a pay Check. You rather play video games, but your mental health needs you more than you need video games at that moment.</TEXT>

To me, arguing how peaceful it will be compared to BLM is saying "let's show them how awful they are by not doing ABC!" I've literally been set up this way. Racists tend to be scared when POC show passion and emotion. They like to change our narrative, our history. To me, a white man with a gun and a huge ego is scarier than a crowd blocking the street.

Looking back, I think I was unhappy with a man and didn't really know what to do. If you ask his wife, I cheated again the second time we dated. In that situation, I was being sexually assaulted by my manager that knew me since i was 6 years old. In their defense, I didn't admit it was rape until I went into therapy. A history of sexual abuse makes relationships really hard and makes it harder to identify predators. The same man did the same thing to my mom. Hard stuff.</TEXT>

I think the guy needed that punch to knock some sense into him. Actions have consequences. Anything sexually offensive is going to cause outrage. Pedophiles get murdered in prison and it's praised. I think we should consider how a physical attack and a emotional attack are both equally fucked up. The flasher wanted to mentally hurt the store employees. The puncher wanted to hurt him physically (or make him stop, depending on the perspective). Don't start no shit won't be no shit. I could see if the flasher did flash, verbally assault, and threaten complete strangers.</TEXT>

If the collections agency can't get to the hospital to send you to an itemized receipt, and you tell them you won't pay without it, sometimes they let it go. I know this from personal experience.

    <TEXT>Hey! It's also good to see what you're paying for. No one is perfect. Just like at a restaurant, sometimes you get rung up for something you didn't get. Sometimes people get charged for an x-ray they didn't receive. It's good to know that before you pay for it. Some people can not pay their bills. Some people have diseases that require them to be at the hospital more than they like to, and therefore accumulate more bills and they can afford. And they usually can't work. Social Security is really hard to get, and Medicaid doesn't pay for everything. I can argue that other countries have this figured out and people aren't drounding in debt, but I think that's common sense at this point. Try to have more compassion for people who are poor.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Under HIPPAA you have the right to protect the privacy of your medical records from third parties. If you didn't give the hospital permission to send the the receipt to you, and the credit bureau did, that's a problem. You may then ask them to provide proof WITH your signature saying you wanted that relased, as that is the only way to do it under HIPPA. Page 119 of the book has the sample letter with more details.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>If I'm right, once the hospital sells them their debt the hospital doesn't really care anymore. The collection agency does. If they violate not only HIPPA but the FICRA as well, there's problems. They have to cease reporting the debt until you authorize the debt. Depending on some factors, they drop it. Or they might take it all the way, which will cost them money and they might drop the whole thing. Nothing is garunteed. It's worth the fight.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Every day I see people pointing out how every little thing a parent does is so horrible. From an embarrassing prank all the way to "my dad didn't cry when I gave him his birthday card. ASSHOLE!" I don't think most people (at least on reddit) understand parents aren't being malicious. Intent SHOULD make a difference. Parents (decent ones) are just trying their best. They're not perfect. They're going to traumatize you one way or another. They're going to do things you don't like. They're raising you from birth to 18+. You spend every. single. day. with them for YEARS. You're not going to like them, and they're not going to like you either sometimes. You suck too. Think about your worst day, and then ask your parents about their worst day with YOU. As a parent, kids get super annoying. Even the most well behaved kids. Parents are still human beings with their own wants and needs who then have to raise you to be a decent human in a crazy world. It's not easy. It gets very overwhelming and frustrating. I remember my mom snapping at me every time I asked her to buy me something. I hated it. I hated her. Why can't she just fucking buy it?! It's because this bitch was struggling to keep the lights on. She's not worried about me having my own laptop for MySpace. We want our parents to be perfect and sweet and kind 24/7. They can't just like we can't. Go to therapy. Talk to your parents. Be as understanding as you want them to be for you. I'm not excusing bad parenting. If you have an abusive or neglectful parent, I truly feel for you and this is NOT about you.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I'm not surprised. I grew up neglected and abused and my peers did too (Low SES neighborhoods). I'm surprised at how some consider non abusive actions as abusive or bad parenting. My wife's family is more abusive than mine in some ways, so she also had a sad time realizing things can be better. My mom actually turned around and is a better mom and a wonderful grandmother. There's hope lol. There's a difference between "this isn't right" and straight up abuse. We might not always see it ourselves but it's there. People, especially kids, often feel entitled to their parents everything. From attention all the way to money. Some people don't get it and think its abuse or "not right." And even if some things aren't right, the parents are still people. I think some Redditors forget that. "Mom shouldn't have had an attitude but mom is a single parent with 4 boys who won't put the seat down after begging them to for years." It's like we don't consider what the parent is going through at all. No one considers that maybe that poster is a shit kid whose parents are just over it. Obvi we shouldn't victim blame. But let me tell you...kids suck and aren't always innocent.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Skinny for me. And if you're a man, you might not understand where a woman can hold a lot of weight. Especially a tall woman. MMA doesn't make you an expert or more knowledgeable than me about weight/bodies, or know what I look like or how I hold my weight lol. Skinny pretty much means the same to me. It's not the look in going for at all. I'm not attracted to it. Again, you don't know where I hold my weight to know if 200lbs would be skinny for me. You have no idea what parts of my body lose fat faster than the others. I think I understand your point, maybe "skinny" wasn't the right word to describe how I feel. I'll say it differently: As a 6ft tall woman 200lbs would be too thin for my comfort and probably wouldn't like the way I look. Especially without any muscle.</TEXT>

You don't know how a person is going to process an event. Some children cope well with a divorce, others don't. Most parents don't have the intentions to hurt their children. It should be expected that parents make mistakes as it should be expected that they apologize like we want kids to do too. I've never met a single person in my entire life who said their parent was perfect and didn't mess up. It's a part of life and the real world. Parents should be there to help you prepare for it, even through their own mistakes. Not only am I a parent, but a nanny. Never had a single complaint. But good for you judging me otherwise.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I see humans killing animals for food, clothing, and whatever is natural. I don't understand why we all forget about the food chain? I can definitely agree things would be better if we hunted and killed everything ourselves. Mass murdering a species for food and goods definitely has consequences. But I don't think it's fair to say eating meat is so horrible. I definitely see the benefits of not eating at all, only eating it sometimes, or only if you got it yourself. But to think other species wouldn't do the same to us if they could is an immature thought. I fully support a vegans/vegetarians choice to not eat meat especially if it's for animal rights. I think it's noble to put animals (or anything) before your self. Keep it up.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I would think so. We care more about a human beings murdered (generally) than a cow. Humans already do this with "black lives matter." It's fine if they're murdered because they're black. So kinda I guess? Humans kind of suck and animals just aren't on our level. Many people see animals as a means to an end, not fellow man. I do think in a few decades when non meat products are more accessible to the poor you'll see a lot of people dropping meat or just not eating it as much. I do think perspectives and attitudes towards animals can and will change. I think we have to treat the situation like you we treat kids. You gotta trick them and play word games to eat their veggies.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Hi, poor person here. It's not that simple. Especially if you are apart of a family who grew up poor, on meat. I can buy 3 lbs of meat, divide it, freeze it, and use it time and time again and my family will be full every time. Yes, we can figure something else out. Can you imagine that pressure? How am I going to feed my family rhis week on $100? A family of 3+? It can make a person very anxious to try to go meatless when they're broke. Of course an animal is anxious before slaughter. Of course they rather live. That's not my point. My point is it's not simple for some. They're just poor and doing what they can to live. Take into account a lot poor people only know of three veggies and three fruits. I think people who are compassionate about saving animals should do their best to educate poor people and offer recipes. Ignorance is bliss. I learned a lot of recipes from the vegan sub (took an hour to not be attacked but we got there). I work harder on vegan meals and try to push my family in a healthier direction. However being poor or ignorant is a valid excuse to me. I think we as a society could do better about educating each other.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I think it is fair to say killing an animal for pleasure is wrong. It's kinda crazy if you think about it. Killing for food isn't. Or clothing. Or whatever. We are at the top. That's how it works. Not saying it's a good system but it's what is happening. Nothing excuses harming another person/animal. But we have reasons. It's the world we live in. Violence happens between all species. Yeah we're smarter but we haven't always been and that's why we have meat. We can NOW but we couldn't before. Now you have to show the world we're not caveman and have other shit to eat. But to pretend the world isn't some viscous place where every being is doing what they need to do to survive, whether it's right or not, is ignorant. Humans are still animals. We're just smarter. And for a smart species we make a lot of dumb choices. So since you are very passionate about this, and I hope you like educating people and advocating for this I wanna add: the best way a vegan person has ever talked to me was with kindness and understanding. Sometimes change is scary and people fight back to avoid change. Keep that in mind. Also being sent delicious looking vegan recipes are helpful.</TEXT>

How are you gonna know something that no one has taught you? And yes basically. What you watched does not do a good job at considering the psychology of people. You can literally condition people to think they'll never be anything. You can abuse people to the point they think they're not worth much. What about women who get pregnant young and have raise a family at 16? How do you expect her to be a future billionaire on her own? She's lucky to get her GED and an associates.

    <TEXT>No they're not. I've taken child abuse prevention classes. Spanking is okay (at least in Ohio) and if you called children services they would be like "....okay...and..?" Culture has a lot to do with it too. Different cultures discipline their children differently and there isn't much anyone of authority can do about it at this time. If you go to the south you would be considered weird for not spanking your child. Of course studies suggest to NOT spank your child but it is not abuse.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I'm so tired of women approach me like I'm so brave for not wearing a bra. I always say "if they're flawless go braless" as a response. What do woman tell me? That their boobs aren't flawless. I've never in my life saw a pair of breasts that were absolutely perfect and natural. Women's bodies are full of flaws, which makes them so beautiful. Even if the baby made your titties fall to your knees, you got big or small and they're full of stretch marks, your nipples are a little too big or too Brown, or maybe you just have a couple bee stings, they're still perfect. You don't have to wear a bra. My back has never been happier. I don't worry about sagging at all, because it's going to happen one way or the other. Some chest exercises will help if you're really worried about it. But if you hate wearing bras, you really don't have to wear one. I encourage all women to go one week without wearing a bra. And invest in those old tank top shelf bras, bralettes are cool and stuff like that. But you don't have to suffer. So stop suffering.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>That's personal to you, though. Other people that is literally what they needed to feel better about themselves. Some people love themselves but hate one thing about them. And that's fine. And they have the right to correct it. Typically with plastic surgery, the doctors ask a lot of questions to make sure this is the best choice for your mental health. If the surgeon or doctor did not do that, you need to find someone else. Situations like South Korea are very much different. That's the difference between "I just want to nose job" and "I want to look like everybody else." And like I said, your doctor should be able to identify that and explain to you that you're not ready for plastic surgery.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I have to say it "should be" as a lot of people don't go to good doctors. Just like I tell people, your tattoo artist should be in the shop and not in their mother's basement. I enjoy how people ask me to show a study regarding the fundamental interactions I've had with people. I don't have a survey for that, sorry. Sometimes fixing something substantial on your mind for years on in, got you bullied, or just simply you don't like, does make you feel a lot better. It's not going to solve all your problems, but it's an excellent first step. And I think it's admirable people take the initiative to spend their time and money to get surgery to make them feel better. You're also not going to go into my job and think I'm not going to try to get every penny I can get. I think the culture around plastic surgery can be toxic at times. But I don't think plastic surgery is wrong. Plastic surgery has helped so many people. My son is interested in being a plastic surgeon, so he can help survivors of severe accidents recover and feel better about themselves. How you feel on the inside or Flex how you feel on the outside. If you hate yourself no matter how internal it is, people can see it and can handle it.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Correct, that's why a proper doctor is essential. I cannot stress that enough. I'm not sure what kind of insurance you have, but that's not true. Insurance does not allow people, to just get surgeries for whatever whenever they want. If you can afford that, you should be able to provide a good doctor that's going to evaluate your mental health. Some people are desperate and go to back-alley doctors and get horrible results. That's a more significant issue than people just getting plastic surgery because they want to. I think that's more worth your time to discuss than this. My son wanting to help people isn't me defending insane cosmetic surgery for personal reasons. And I've also never had cosmetic surgery. I do work for people who get cosmetic surgery, and fillers done. We talked about it, and it seems like it does make a difference in their day. To deny people the right to Happiness, which isn't hurting you at all, goes to show how deep your empathy runs.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Maybe. You can look into "learned helplessness" if you want more of a scientific explanation that tackles a little bit of what I'm saying. It's tough for people in certain circumstances to overcome certain obstacles. Though what OP is saying seems simple, it isn't always easy. Think about a kid who robbed a liquor store with his friends. He was only 15 but tried as an adult and now has a felony. That felony prevents him from voting, going to school, and getting a good job. It's not his fault he was tried as an adult, but now it's much harder to succeed. No matter how hard he works, the world sees him as a felon and treats him as such. Less than 20% of teen moms go to college and finish. Why? Because it's tough to raise a kid and go to school. Depending on your personality and background, it might be impossible to juggle both. Life isn't easy, and there isn't one single post that will help everyone.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I disagree. I don't think it's immoral at all. The person cheating is wrong. People cheat for a multitude of reasons. I don't think cheating is comparable to murder. It hurts, but no one dies. Lives are ruined but that might've happened anyway if the relationship was going under and the other partner was head over heels. To blame anyone but your partner is immature IMO. They have free will and chose to violate the relationship. They were going to don't regardless of who it was with. They deserve all the blame and shame.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I like your perspective a lot. I think humans aren't made for monogamy. I believe that a lot of relationships are being forced and aren't happy. It's not common that people have excellent communication with their partners or know when to leave a relationship that makes them unhappy. I understand both sides and like I said, I don't think many people are naturally monogomous. If people were more open to open relationships I believe we wouldn't see a lot of cheating. If you hurt someone, you did that take ownership of it. However, cheating isn't black and white and I don't put any blame on the other person. They're not necessarily making a good choice, but it's not their fault. The mindset of blaming them makes healing harder.</TEXT>

Can we explain that to me? I can only speak for myself as to why I buy black. It's to support my people as there is a lot of racism and discrimination against black-owned businesses. How many black-owned companies can you name without googling it? How many times have you seen black businesses being advertised by white-owned news channels!/networks/schools/etc.? Recognition and serving a community that is close to you is essential. By getting service from a black-owned business and sharing it on social media can be free advertising that said business needs. Why is that a problem?</TEXT>

I think it's unnecessary to provide a fucking permission slip, but if men are out here tripping on doctors, I believe doctors have the right to mention it to the patient. When I spoke to my OB about why it's so hard to obtain this form of birth control, it seems to come down to liability. Men are outpatient, it is easy and cheaper to freeze and store sperm, and the surgery is less invasive.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Cheating doesn't reflect who you are as a person. It seems like a lot of people commenting are hurt and can't look past it. Infidelity is common, unfortunely. It's not something to be encouraged. But to sit here and think just because a person cheats they're immoral or bad is so childish. It's none of your business for one, and you're an outsider looking in. You have no idea of the situation. "Sex Outside The Lines" is an excellent book by a licensed therapist for those who want to dive deeper into sex and why we do what we do.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>In America, we have a lot of different cultures and races living together on one giant mass of land. Throughout time and colonization, accents and dialects were created. With these accents and dialects, you get an exciting version of English. Just like if you were to go across the pond, the Scots are going to talk a lot different than the Brits. They're both correct, and as long as you can understand what somebody is trying to tell you, there's nothing wrong with how they're talking. Itincrediblyely judgemental to evaluate somebody's intelligence based on their speaking and language abilities. A comedian makes the joke about if Albert Einstein had a thick southern accent, nobody would have listened to him. And that's true. If you let how people sound affects your opinion of their intelligence, you're going to meet a lot of smart people. You're just going to meet a lot of boring people who paid attention in school harder than some.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Based on everyone I know who married young, it didn't work out. Some sure, most no. I believe you should wait to marry. Your frontal lobe isn't finished growing until you're almost 30. Your decision-making skills aren't excellent yet. Life can be very long, so to be committed to someone so young can be overwhelming. A lot of time and money goes into a wedding, and even more into a relationship. Marriage isn't bad, but it isn't for everyone. You might not know it isn't for you in your 20s. Financial strain can cause issues in a marriage, and a lot of 20 somethings aren't prepared for that. People are waiting longer to get married because they want to finish school, have a better job, or just don't see the point. As an ordained minister, I can tell you marriage is only taxes. Everything else is between the couple. With that being said, don't worry about what other people say. It's between you and your partner. Only you two know how in love you are or if you're ready. Marriage shouldn't be used to scare people, but everyone should understand it can be a life long commitment and should be taken seriously.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I don't think these two things should be discussed together as they distract people from essential issues from each side. It's kinda asking, "What's worse? Burning down businesses (public reaction to the murders) or unjustly murdering a woman?" We know what's worse for the family of the victim and society as a whole. It does not mean the reaction is necessary or fair when we take a life, its murder #8212;accident or not. When a person dies of lethal injection, their death certificate reads "murder" for the cause of death. When we take a life, it is murder. Families want justice, and that is reasonable. Society likes liberties and justice. So far, the only person experiencing any freedom are the people who murdered a person and people who watched. Justice is not being served. This could be you. This is what society is deeming as okay by not charging them. It is not okay.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Therapists also advocate for you. My therapist helps me find financial help, schedules doctors appointments and sends me materials regarding my mental health journey. Therapy is useful, especially paired with medication if needed. If you never feel any better after an appointment, you might need a different therapist. Like doctors, they have specialties. You CAN google it, but how do you treat yourself? Prescribe medicines? Come up with coping mechanisms? Bounce ideas/feelings off of? How do you know you're looking at real peer-reviewed research that is proven to be helpful or not? What if you have a mental illness? You most likely don't know how to treat it. You can google how to fix a broken arm, but unless you have medical training you can't fix it. Our brains work the same way.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Your feelings are valid. However, I do think you need to let it go. People take weddings too seriously. Who cares if your mom is getting married for the 5th time, I'm sure everyone is eye-rolling like, "okay, Susan, sure." Your sister deserves to be happy too. It's COVID time; use it as an excuse to slow down your plans and let them get married first if you care about it being "all about you." Weddings are about love and happiness between two people. As soon as you let little shit from outside forces interfere, your wedding sucks. No one will have fun. Your partner has to listen to some bullshit even after the wedding. And yes it's about you AND your partner. They probably don't care about any of this, and now the wedding has nothing to do with them anymore. Stay in your lane, and have FUN. Being in the drama isn't fun, so don't do it.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I think it's okay to leave a relationship if you're not happy. It seems like other people find it fucked up you want to go because of the lack of sex and affection. I don't think so. If it's not working out, it's not working out. How important sex and physical affection depend on the individual. I would not be okay if my wife came out as asexual and then stopped touching me. She is who she is, and I can't change that. We did not start that way, though. Does it mean we can't figure something else out to stay together? We can, but if one of us doesn't want to, oh well. I would still love her and cherish her, but our relationship will not be the same. Sex is essential to a lot of people. Physical affection is vital for a lot of people. But your relationship is just that, YOURS. If YOU aren't happy YOU need to leave the relationship. As far as telling her to leave, give her 3-6 months to figure it out and do your best to communicate the relationship is over.</TEXT>
