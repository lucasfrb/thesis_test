    <TEXT>I used to be super popular, but I became extremely self conscious and stopped hanging out with my popular friends. I would find a corner and be alone. I don #8217;t trust anyone (I don #8217;t understand trust) and I don #8217;t know why people trust other people. I avoid talking to people (and try to avoid my family and friends.) I hate myself and have been self-proclaimed depressed for a while now. I don #8217;t know if it is depression, but I am always sad, tired, unmotivated, and lazy. I don #8217;t eat lunch anymore because I think I #8217;m fat ( I #8217;m 95 pounds). I have put a knife to my wrist and pushed (didn #8217;t break skin) and have contemplated suicide multiple times. Loneliness is addicting. Loneliness is like a drug for me, and it is the worst thing that has ever happened to me. Oh, and by the way I #8217;m 13.</TEXT>

I used to contemplate suicide often. I am now in 8th grade, found my new friends, got a massive glow up (still not that good), and am going to the school dance with the girl I have liked (on and off) for 1.5 years or so. I am still self conscious and slightly depressed however. I nearly killed myself about 2 months ago (put the knife to my wrist and sliced, but didn #8217;t break skin because I didn #8217;t push hard enough.) I did it because my parents were fighting really bad (per usual) and had enough of the torture. I am happy it didn #8217;t kill me. I am hoping 2020 will be my year, cuz if it isn #8217;t I don #8217;t know what the hell im gonna do.</TEXT>

I don #8217;t know if it is bad for you, so I made it into a lean sort of thing and downed that shit. It is dangerous, but you would have to take over 5 times what I took to OD.

    <TEXT>No, it won #8217;t get you high. It will make you really sleepy and maybe get you sick tho. If I were you, I would take some DXM (it is in most cough medicine) and wait like 25 minutes. Make it into a lean-like drink. Add sprite, jolly ranchers, and some cough medicine (no codiene.) Don #8217;t take with alcohol, as it will surely kill you. I am currently coming down off of a DXM high and it is great. It is my first ever high.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Thee is this kid named Carlos at my school. He #8217;s fat and an asshole. He regularly talks shit and steals and breaks people #8217;s stuff. He stole one of my friends calculators and snapped it. He #8217;s stollen a shit ton of pencils and crap from us. He has punched me and a crap ton of my friends and choked me multiple times. He has brought weed and crap to school. He also insults us and calls me white boy like it #8217;s an insult. It #8217;s like bullying except I haven #8217;t cried yet. I told my friend I was gonna fight him and he said let #8217;s just go snitch. This is 8th grade btw. I am a stick and there is nothing I can do unless I snitch or fight. I could get him expelled by snitching, since he had made jokes and said he was gonna shoot up the school and that I was an easy target. We would remain anonymous though, cuz I ain #8217;t tryna get called a snitch or get beat up by his friends. I am a competing martial artist and could kick his ass, but I ain #8217;t tryna shot. I don #8217;t know what I should do any advice?</TEXT>

We will then stop deforestation and plant hundreds of millions of trees until air pollution is not longer a factor. Eventually, some countries will form an alliance and start a nuclear war to end my reign of good. I will then chop off the cocks of the rebellion leaders and sacrifice them to God. He will bless this planet by bringing back all of the animals and plants that humans made extinct. Eventually, there will be a global pandemic and I will take half of the population and lock them in a super-secure mega bunker that I have been building for years, and the other half will die. They will sink into the soil and fertilize the ground, so their deaths won #8217;t be for nothing. I will create the perfect world, explore the oceans, and since I am immortal, be the leading astronaut in exploring the vast universe and be the first to make alien contact. Again, I will dick-slap them into submission and create the perfect universe.</TEXT>

    <TITLE>My great grandfather just died and I barely shead a tear</TITLE>
    <DATE>2020-03-18 04:43:51</DATE>
    <TEXT>He was in a really bad car accident. He didn #8217;t die painfully, so that #8217;s my main worry out of the way. I was barely able to shead a year. I know he is in a better place, and a lot of my family has died in the 13 years I #8217;ve been alive. Almost 1 every other year, not including pets. I might have just gotten used to it. We weren #8217;t that close, but I still loved him a lot. I had to think about it for a long time before I started crying, and it was only 1 or 2 tears. What the fuck is wrong with me?</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Thanks. My parents told me and my sister that he died. I kinda smiled, and my mom got mad and asked why I smiled so I started fake crying. I actually started crying a little bit, but not what one would expect. I think I just remembered this thing that we used to do where we would salute each other. I also remembered all the family birthdays where we would go over his house and have breakfast for dinner. I didn #8217;t have very many memories with him thought, and they were all happy. I will miss him very much, but I don #8217;t think I should cry over it. This really helped, sorry for the long reply</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Unless you are very old or have underlying conditions, you have a very low chance of dying. Less than 1%. If I had friends, I may not push for it, but I would still definitely go to parties and activities. I would just carry on with my daily life. For heathy people, it is just like the common cold. No offense, but you kinda sound like the idiot that buys all the toilet paper, hand sanitizer, and believes everything the media says.</TEXT>

I #8217;m so lonely, but I like the loneliness. It #8217;s addicting. I just want to be alone, but whenever I #8217;m alone I want to die. I attempted once when my parents were fighting really bad. Put the knife to my wrist and pushed. Barely broke skin before it hurt to bad and I couldn #8217;t do it. I #8217;m so weak I can #8217;t even kill myself. I don #8217;t know what #8217;s wrong with me. I have the perfect life. Live in a good house, with a good family, both sides of my family are very wealthy. I just don #8217;t know anymore. What do I even do at this point? I just want to be dead. I don #8217;t want help. My parents threatened to send me to therapy, but Covid-19 happened and everything shut down.Nobody but my family would even care if I killed myself. I #8217;m a fucking loser. What can I even do anymore?</TEXT>

    <TITLE>How do I know if I sprained or fractured my wrist?</TITLE>
    <DATE>2020-05-06 03:22:28</DATE>
    <TEXT>Today I was riding my neighbors quad at their ranch and hit a large rock while half on a hill at 40MPH. I flew sideways off the quad, flew about 4 feet through the air (not exaggerating), landed on my wrist, rolled about 6 feet, and started screaming. I #8217;m a teenage boy who has done some stupid stuff in my life, but throws was BY FAR the worst pain I have ever felt. I didn #8217;t feel it initially. I got up off the ground, walked over to the quad (rolled about 15 feet), dropped to the ground, and started screaming at the top of my lungs. My parents and their friends didn #8217;t hear because they were in a razor. I had to pick my phone out of my pocket while screaming in pain and call my mom. I tried not to cry but I started crying so bad my mom could barely understand me. They turned around and we had to drive back about 20 minutes back to the house. I took an 800mg Advil for the lain and wrapped an ice pack around my arm with gauze. It #8217;s been about 6 hours and it is still painful while typing this. I cannot raise my lower arm without almost crying in pain and I cannot physically twist my arm 90 degrees in any direction accept palm down. It is barely swollen, but my fingers were initially numb and I still have to have support on my arm while walking. Is it broken, fractured, or swollen? I #8217;m a few hours away from a doctor so please help</TEXT>

Don #8217;t know how close I was but I was swimming in Greece to a rock about 5 #8221; ft from shore. The water was probably about 60-100 feet deep and crystal clear to the bottom. Deathly fear of sharks by the way. Was swimming out with my dad to cliff jump off of it. The current got really weird and I couldn #8217;t swim forward or backward no matter how hard I tried and the waves were going over my head. Kept getting pushed under and my water shoes were falling off. Breathing while hyperventilating is not very easy especially as an 11 or 12 year old. Ended up slowly pushing my way to the surface and then to the rock. We jumped off and I just floated back again with less struggle since the waves were going my direction.

    <TEXT>Social anxiety, anxiety, extremely self conscious. If I start panicking go to the bathroom or outside and calm down. Wear hoodies so people don #8217;t see most of your body and you blend in. Try not to procrastinate, and if you do do the task slowly. Social anxiety mixes really bad with self conscious because I #8217;m always scared with how I look and and act. Can #8217;t be in big groups of people without immediate access to an exit. Can #8217;t talk to girls. The list goes on. I realize it #8217;s not that bad but I can have a minor god complex when it comes to some stuff. I realize none of this is as bad as some other stuff but just putting this out there please no hate Edit: also some times hurt myself just to see how much pain I can take, so I guess minor self harm?</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Social media and society make depression look cool and aesthetic. That is, until you have no motivation to get up. Until you don #8217;t care enough to eat anymore or change your clothes. Until you don #8217;t care enough to brush your teeth, or work out. Until you cut off every friend you ever had and push away family, breaking bonds. Until you put more energy into faking happiness and emotions than school and personal needs. Until you look in the mirror and find flaws about yourself until you can #8217;t stand the thought of living in your body and start hating yourself. Until small things make you angry. Until suicide sounds relieving, but you can #8217;t do it because it would hurt your family and other people who cared. Until your parents THREATEN you with therapy. I have a good life and get basic human needs and other things. No matter how much money I have or what I get, I #8217;m just not happy. I actually like wearing masks, since I don #8217;t have to try as hard to fake my emotion. I shouldn #8217;t feel this way, but I do. I have undiagnosed PTSD and whenever I hear yelling I #8217;m my house I get extremely scared and start sweating. The first time I have come close to committing suicide my parents were arguing and pushing on each side of my door, and I was screaming and crying, with the knife to my wrist, pushing hard. Neither of them even looked, they just kept pushing on the door. The second time my parents were at a party up the street, and I was playing Xbox with my friend. My mom came down the street crying, then went back up. I was confused but didn #8217;t really notice anything. I later heard screaming in the front yard. My dad had cheated on my mom. She was screaming and throwing things. They came inside and my mom started throwing pictures off the walls and throwing chairs. They were in my sisters room and my mom punched my dad in the face. He layed on the ground while my mom was screaming. I had to call the cops on my own fucking mother. The most recent time was when my mom woke my dad up from the guest room and called him a loser. My dad went crazy and started throwing pictures. They were screaming and arguing and I started telling them to  #8220;shut the fuck up #8221;. I yelled that at them for the 2nd time and my dad questioned if I was gonna step up. I tried but pussied out in the end. I layed on my dogs bed, crying into her fur. I have horrible social anxiety and have very few people left to talk to. I struggle to even talk to my family and I hate my sister. Some people in my distant family have done very bad things but I swore to the receiver of thoes things not to tell. I trust basically nobody and would not put my life in anyone #8217;s hands. I have gotten slightly better. I have become numb to feelings, and can #8217;t tell the difference between reality and dreams. I #8217;m rarely happy, and I can #8217;t even tell when I #8217;m sad. I cannot cry because of sadness, no matter how hard I try. I don #8217;t fear death in the slightest. Everybody dies one day. You can #8217;t cheat death. I have never been clinically diagnosed as depressed. I lied on my mental health test when I went to the doctors. I didn #8217;t want to see a therapist. Now all I want is someone to talk to. This isn #8217;t a cry for attention, and I don #8217;t care about some stupid reddit awards. If you don #8217;t believe me, you don #8217;t have to. If you read the entire thing, thanks for listening. Please reach out to any friends or family who are depressed. You may just save a life.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I #8217;ve been looking for a way to describe how I feel, but nothing explains it as well as this. About 1 year ago was the worst point that I had, and I was suicidal and that was all I thought about all day. Once I started getting better, I though I was going back to normal. It seemed like that for a while, then I realized that I couldn #8217;t sympathize with most people and that I couldn #8217;t even cry out of sadness or pain anymore, only anger/fear. I couldn #8217;t even cry when my great-grandfather died. I started to realize that I had never left that place, I had just adapted to it. I can no longer cry (no matter what) and I have a hard time being able to feel love for someone. I have horrible trust issues and now Self Harm almost daily (cutting). I just want to get back to how I was, or I fear that I #8217;ll stay like this forever. (I have never been clinically diagnosed and will never claim to be)</TEXT>
