    <TEXT>I know this is cliche but - workout. Even if you walk for like 30 mins it'll really help boost your mood. - stop eating shit food. High intake of added sugars will really mess with your blood sugar levels, and you'll feel like shit. - eat real food (fruits, nuts, vegetables) - try doing nothing literally. It's sort of like a meditation for me at least. - if shit happens and you can't control it, let it happen. This will pass. At least you learned something from it. - how you act and think when facing a challenge or problem will really have an effect. So try to pause and think before you do something. Don't do something out of anger, or don't make promises you can't keep when you're in a good mood. This really helped me stay sane.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>How you bring yourself really matters. On one hand, I had a short guy friend but he brings himself confidently, by that he went from a 6 to a 7.5 or 8 even. On the other hand, I have guy friends who are physically attractive but are so insecure. I can't stand guys roasting themselves all the time. It can bring them down to a 6 or a 5 even. At least for me.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I was diagnosed with hyperthyroidism November, 2015. I gained over 10kg in one month around December 2015 (yes, I know) from taking methimazole (to control thyroid hormone production. Hairloss, acne, and weight gain happened in a short amount of time, and I never had these problema prior to my thyroid issues. I got radio active iodine therapy around June 2016. I was advised to stay at home and isolate for one month. I lost weight during my isolation because the only thing I ate mas mostly bread and peanut butter because I had no appetite at all. After that, I became hypothyroid since my thyroid gland was taken out through RAI. Ever since then, I have been taking levothyroxine for supplementation. It was a wild ride, if my levels weren't right, my energy levels would plummet and experience hairfall (I lost 50% of my hair). I tried mitigating my issues through major lifestyle changes. I went pescatarian 4 years ago, I cut dairy, sugary foods, and processed foods and incorporated exercise daily. Through this and getting the right levothyroxine dosage, I was able to control my hormones. As a result, I never felt healthier. I am fit now, if I wasn't diagnosed with hyperthyroidism, I don't think I will have a major lifestyle change. It took me years to adjust my lifestyle to cater to my thyroid issues, but it was worth it.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Yes, I agree. But depending on you skin tone, you could either look like you're having hepatitis/jaundice or not from the yellow glow. So it's important to be cautious and track the changes so you won't over do it.</TEXT>
