    <TEXT>There are some islands ,but no ships. why would there be if you can fly anywhere? There are some Trinkets that only can be lootet, for speed and damage buff, but they are not important. Trinkets for Crit. manareg. healreg. and amour can be crafted. Gear that you loot is the same as crafted ones but usally with higher lvl requierments and worse stats. best to craft the gear yourself, which is unlock from the skill tree. Currently all servers have the exact same World. Exploring the world is fun. yes you can cheese mob while fly, but it takes more mana pots, which you have to farm first.</TEXT>
