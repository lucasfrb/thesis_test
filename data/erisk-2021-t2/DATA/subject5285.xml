    <TEXT>On March 12, 2020, the KuCoin Group published a declaration through official KuCoin channels to remind users and partners to be cautious about scammers, following several reports from users that a website was using the KuCoin trademark to ask users to transfer digital assets to specific deposit addresses by operating false incentive activities on webpages.

    <TITLE>Explanation on the Recent Delay of DOT Deposit to KuCoin</TITLE>
    <DATE>2020-08-23 13:30:38</DATE>
    <TEXT>For the recent delay of DOT deposit to #KuCoin, we have confirmed with the #Polkadot team that the main cause is some exchanges sent the transaction to KuCoin in batches, and if any call within the batch fails, the batch will be interrupted and all calls will be cancelled. Why some calls failed and some did not? The minimum amount to activate an account is 1 DOT. If there's a transaction to a new account that is below the existential deposit amount (1 DOT), no account will be created and other transactions in the batch will fail as well. The #Polkadot team, KuCoin, and all exchanges involved are fully aware of the issue now, and we are working closely with the tech team of all parties to solve the problem as soon as possible. Thanks a lot for your patience and understanding! See the official tweet from KuCoin Global CEO  amp; co-founder, Johnny Lyu, here: [https://twitter.com/lyu\_johnny/status/1297523592863727619](https://twitter.com/lyu_johnny/status/1297523592863727619)</TEXT>

    <TEXT>After the official launch of the betanet for KuChain Testnet - Kratos in July 2020, KuChain continues to be under steady development, with its mainnet expected to be launched in Q4 2020. In order to help promote the sustainable growth of KuChain and KuCoin, after discussing the partial release of the tokens with all parties holding locked KCS, the KCS team has decided that these tokens will remain locked until the launch of the KuChain Whitepaper. A new locked KCS release plan will be unveiled in the whitepaper. The tokens to be released will be used to benefit the public chain ecosystem, setting up a KuChain Ecosystem Fund for instance, and will not go directly to the secondary market. Please stay tuned for our upcoming announcements.
