    <TITLE>I have low empathy and limited emotions and I wish bad things would happen to me so I can feel something</TITLE>
    <DATE>2020-07-31 14:39:23</DATE>
    <TEXT>TL;DR I have low empathy, I don #8217;t care about others except for myself and the few people I love I barely care for. I also have very good control of my emotions and secretly wish that bad things would happen to me so I can see if I truly have emotions/empathy I #8217;ve had low empathy for a long time. I just don #8217;t care for other people, even my loved ones I care for at a bare minimum and idk how to fix it? I have this  #8220;protagonist #8221; mentality where only I matter and I should only care for myself bcos its my life. So I find it hard to be honest and vulnerable to other people, and I #8217;ve already accepted I #8217;ll never be in a functional relationship. I started realising this when shit started happening this month. Earlier in July, my uncle died. A few weeks later, I found out my ex has bpd and almost died from a suicide attempt. I didn #8217;t really feel anything deep inside, or it #8217;d be mostly about how to make it about myself. The people I love could be pouring their heart out in front of me and I #8216;d be indifferent. Sometimes I #8217;ll even get angry or embarrassed to see them like that. Once my best friend tried to comfort me and I ignored her completely she started crying, but I didn #8217;t care. Another time my ex gf was stressed and started crying and I got pissed and left her while our friends comforted her. Now idk why I #8216;m this, it #8217;s not like I #8217;m emotionless. I #8217;m actually very impressionable in in social situations, but I can #8217;t open up and be honest to others. I only have my family and 2 friends that I #8217;m barely close with, and I find it very easy to cut people off and don #8217;t care if I hurt them when I ghost them. Sometimes I want bad things to happen to me so I can feel something. Literally anything - something traumatic, a death of someone close to me, someone dying in front of me, getting kidnapped. I think I deserve it for how much of a bitch I am but also I just want to see if I actually can feel these emotions. Idk if this is some kind of mental illness thing or if I #8217;m just an asshole</TEXT>

    <TEXT>i think at that point satan realises 3 things about that flashback: 1. ryo realises he always had emotions, he just repressed it. akira #8217;s magical empathy could sense it from him, thats why he said you #8217;re crying too, it was just getting washed by the rain. its also why akira told him not to be afraid when they met, ryo was sad and lonely since the beginning. 2. it also means that if ryo could feel sadness at that point, that means he could also feel love. satan has a series of childhood flashbacks leading to his final monologue, where he shows his care in the subtlest of ways  #8211; he beats up the bullies who took akira #8217;s shoes and returns them, he goes out into the rain to look for akira and uses his umbrella to shield him. satan is basically looking back and realising he loved akira since they were kids, and that he was always going to end up mourning akira eventually. but despite knowing that, he cries anyways, like how akira cries even though the kitten was sick. 3. it parallels how ryo treats akira. ryo believes in the survival of the fittest, and yet he fell in love with the softest human on earth. deep down ryo always knew akira would die, so he did everything in his power to protect him just like how akira shields the dying kitten. its when akira does die that satan realises his efforts to help him were futile. satan finally understands that emotions dont follow his logic - knowing the kitten will die still makes akira cry, just like how knowing that akira would die doesnt make it any less sadder when it happens.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>basically its about Satan learning a lesson about love as punishment for defying God. the events of Crybaby is a time loop, where Ryo will always fall in love with Akira, cause the apocalypse then end up killing him. in his sorrow, he learns about the importance of love, because previously he undermined it, thinking it a weakness of humans. Satan believes heavily in survival of the fittest - strength and logic are superior to emotions, hence why he hates humans but sides with demons. but in reality, he is extremely lonely - he was abandoned by his Father and everyone hates him. so God has him fall in love with the kindest human on Earth - Akira, the first and only person to show Satan unconditional love. he becomes attached to Akira but never realises that he #8217;s capable of love and empathy until it #8217;s too late, when he #8217;s killed the only person he #8217;s ever cared about. he says  #8220;why am I the only one talking? #8221; because his plan was to fuse the weak Akira with the most powerful demon so he could survive Satan #8217;s apocalypse and rule Earth together. but Satan ruined Akira #8217;s life and then killed him in his single-focused goal to destroy the humans, and that #8217;s the moment he realises his plan fucked up and his beliefs are wrong. emotions do exist and they ARE important, because Satan feels regret, grief, love all at once for the first time in his life. his grief is so strong that he gives up completely because there #8217;s no reason to continue without Akira. after he learns this lesson, God destroys Earth once more and you can see a second moon has formed, implying the world was reset so Satan can learn this lesson all over again as his personal hell.</TEXT>
