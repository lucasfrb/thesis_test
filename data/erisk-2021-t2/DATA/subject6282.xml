    <TEXT>I think it's more reasonable to have them shelter in place and let's protect them instead of having 100% of people shelter to protect a small percentage of people. I'd be all for society providing for them as well</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I think it's legitimate to question why we ruin an economy which in itself causes pain and death as well as causing people to put off things like cancer treatments which again causes death all to protect a fairly small percentage of the population. It makes zero sense to me and I'm not going to go along with a dumb plan like that especially when 3 years from now nothing is going to be any different than it is today</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I wont get it at least not for a few years and I'm not against vaccinations but from a risk reward perspective I'm a young healthy guy I eat healthy workout take vitamins etc. My chance of dying from covid is well under 0.05% where as a rushed vaccine that may not even be much more than 60% effective with unknown side effects to protect me against something that has a minimal chance of killing me doesnt seem smart from a risk reward perspective. And for any critics that's not anti science that's actually using the science to make an intelligent decision for myself</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I think what may eventually happens if this continues on into the fall and winter is the country may kind of divide in the sense that those that want to be cautious can do so together a d those that want to live life as normal will do so together. I dont necessarily see people moving but vacationing in a place where they can live life as normal will become very popular. I'm in chicago and while things have lightened up a bit for a while I was heading to indiana to go to the beach or a pool to go out to eat etc</TEXT>

    <TEXT>That's not necessarily a deal its just regional price differences. Heck you can buy a house in Toledo for like 30k nobody really wants to live in Toledo though. Texas on the other hand has a strong economy and job market nice weather nice housing stock so prices could rise. The entire southeast has exploded in the past decade with prices tripling in many areas. I'd still say its not a great time to hunt for deals despite the economy being strong theres been an inventory shortage for years that has only been made worse by covid so while there's always deals id say its more a bad time to get into re than a good time</TEXT>

The reality on the other hand is if you fix a couple gfci outlets for a couple hundred bucks you can sell the home to am fha home buyer who will pay market price as opposed to selling it to a cash buyer for 60% less than a home buyer who woupda lived that would have paid.

    <TEXT>Google has no way of knowing if you paid for a link or acquired it white hat. The problem you'll run into not paying is what incentive does someone have to give you a link? I get 3 to 5 contacts a week about telling me they wrote an amazing blog post on xyz topic and I should link to it or replace an existing link with theirs. There's zero incentive for me to spend my time doing this for them and being am 3com site id prwfer to keep people on my site. 200 bucks on the other hand will typically make it worth my time. I never ask for money I just ignore them typically but if they make an offer ill generally link to them</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I feel your pain I've had over 150k in paypal rolling reserves. I'm not really following your story though. In my case paypal took 10k or 12k off the top i don't recall the exact amount then held back 20% of each transaction. They also discussed it with me prior to doing it and gave me a personal rep so I had a contact there after. They didn't just seize all my money or take money out of my bank account. I'm always telling people once your business grows get a real merchant account don't use paypal or stripe but people wanna save themselves $20 a month. Basically stripe is worried your gonna charge up 100k and then disappear and not send product or have chargebacks and they don't want to be holding the bag</TEXT>

Also if we're to believe the media narrative as well as surveys an equal ir greater amount of pwople woupdnt have wanted to go if it was in person. The thing that would annoy me is people trying to make the case remote is as good as in person. Remote classes have long been an option if I wanted to take them i would have instead of in person. For myself and many others the reason we go in person is for the accountability as well as just learning better in a classroom setting. Heck you could literally skip college all together and read books and watch YouTube lessons for free alot of what college is about is group projects access to labs, internships etc all of which we can't really do now.

    <TEXT>My point is the fact that people are out there going out of their way to try to ruin other people's lives. Not saying this guy maybe didn't deserve it but I heard Joe Rogan make a good point recently, he said when he's doing his podcast and he's talking with a buddy, trying to fill the air, etc he's said lots of things he himself doesn't agree with or after the fact he realizes he shouldn't have said. Now obviously this guy wasn't doing a podcast but I'm sure you've said something when having a bad day or angry or not thinking that could get you cancelled if someone went out of their way to press the issue. This is also a slippery slope in that what's next you don't like the political candidate I like so I try to get you fired, where does it end. There's some things where I think this is deserved you kick a dog, molest a kid, but calling dolly parton a slut in my book doesn't rise to that level though if I'm reading into it this does have a racial undertone. I think black lives matter is a trash garbage organization not because black lives matter they do of course but the organization is a marxist violent hypocrite organization</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Glad its worked out for you but thats hardly a reason to use it you could be saving yourself probably 1% which is 6k savings per year. Also stripe doesn't vet you upfront thats why you press a button and start taking payments where as a real merchant account will vet you upfront so they don't have to freeze your funds and ruin your business later. I was processing over 3 mill a year with paypap and stripe for 2 or 3 years and it was good until it wasn't. At your volume you shouldn't be using a turnkey noob solution like stripe imho Just pull a quick search on this sub and you'll find dozens of horror stories</TEXT>

    <TEXT>If your using shopify the crappy part is the 2% transaction fee for not using stripe though you can get that down to 0.5% by going to a higher shopify package. Go to your bank or Vantiv or first data with your volume you vould probably get under 2% maybe 1.7% which would be a huge savings and a safer option. If you use big commerce or another platform the transaction fee won't be an issue as they dont have one like shopify.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>There's actually legitimate science against wearing masks if your going to follow science look at it all and have an open mind dont make a decision and then find specific science to back up your pre-made ideas There have been extensive randomized controlled trial (RCT) studies, and meta-analysis reviews of RCT studies, which all show that masks and respirators do not work to prevent respiratory influenza-like illnesses, or respiratory illnesses believed to be transmitted by droplets and aerosol particles. Furthermore, the relevant known physics and biology, which I review, are such that masks and respirators should not work. It would be a paradox if masks and respirators worked, given what we know about viral respiratory diseases: The main transmission path is long-residence-time aerosol particles ( lt; 2.5  #956;m), which are too fine to be blocked, and the minimum-infective dose is smaller than one aerosol particle. And you calling my scientists idiots is not following science fyi</TEXT>

    <TEXT>This seems to be a strategy being used right now offer over asking with the intention of wasting the sellers time and tying up the house hoping you can get it down after inspection. .

    <TEXT>Not at all comps mean nothing price is what someome is willing to pay. Comps are also subjective. The house I was gonna buy was 40 bucks per sq ft over average but that doesn't take into account the half acre backyard the 3normous powered out building screened in pool or the fact it was 3 blocks from the ocean. Right now everything is appraising no matter how high. How is the seller responsible because you chose to pay "too much" seller listed at say 300k. Its you and other buyers deciding to pay 330k. You expect a seller to say 330k is too high im gonna take a lower offer</TEXT>

Now maybe those consequences are less than loss of life from covid but there are consequences right? So that means we can have an open discussion about the consequences of a lockdown vs no lockdown. Yoi don't want to have that legitimate discussiom though you wanna name call and shutdown the discussion and then act surprised things are so polarized and divided Whats even more interesting is your throwing around terms like bigots and antivaxxers which has nothing to do with this discussion. Bigot just makes no sense and as far as antivaxxers you can be against lockdowns and for vaccines but again your trying to paint the other side as a very specific thing</TEXT>

You know going in high your likely to win the house but then use the inspection to try to get back to what would have been your realistic offer. You've tied up the sellers home for a few weeks theyre invested in the process and they may negotiate with you.

I don't have the room or equipment to work out at home and even if I did I just can't get motivated at home I'm not for lockdowns but the reality is either lockdown like China or not at all because this patchwork of cracking down on some businesses and not others is doing nothing to stop covid and is putting the economy in a worse state everyday</TEXT>

Average citizens are also getting fed up with government stepping aside and letting this happen. If this rioting isn't put down by the police fed up citizens will put an end to it thats just the reality. We saw the same thing happening in chicago ie neighbors and even gangs defending their neighborhoods but things never really kicked off like this. As far as rioters or protestors go you have a beef with police grow some balls and go burn down the police station not aunt bettys bakery a gaming lounge and a dinosaur museum.

If your a dropshipper selling ali junk you have bigger issues than how your site looks however I will say customer experience which is often minor visual things can have a huge effect. Ive run tests like having a pic of say a pill bottle and a lic of a pill bottle with the pills in front of it showing them amount to 30% plus higher conversions which seems dumb bit ab testing proved it. Also something like moving an add to cart button can make a huge difference. The bigger problem is all the i can't say the word bc this sub is so strict but half butt businesses that provide horrible customer experiences. If everyone had a legitimate business and wasn't selling an assortment of paranoid bracelets the discussiom of a sites visual layout would be more meaningful because the basics are nailed down</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Lol seriously dude people can be charged with anything. The cop that was attacked and had his tazer stolen was charged with first or 2nd degree murder ie the Wendy's incident. Charges are almost always political. People are also not charged based on connections or who they are so your first point is asinine. As far as fleeing he called the cops on himself and walked up to them they let him go. He then drove all of 12 minutes back to his house. Thats quite the getaway. You would be a horrible juror and its quote terrifying that you think being charged means guilty. This incident aside keep an open mind thats really messed up you think that way</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Your argument is that every life matters no matter what. Even if we have to destroy our economy, even if kids can't get educated, even if our quality of life is crap its worth it because we're saving lives. The analogy to the cars is is the exact same Using your logic every life matters we can save 50k lives a year banning cars so let's do it. Doesn't matter everywhere we wanna go tskes 10x longer to get there because we're walking. Doesn't matter we cant transport large heavy items. Its worth it because it saves lives. You say that will never happen but a lockdown should have never happened. Another question you and everyone else on here never wants to answer is while its an unpleasant combo to have you are okay with some level of death in order to keep the world spinning. If you weren't we would shutdown every year for flu season so the reality is your okay with 60k deaths in a year but not okay with 150k deaths in a year. Where between 50k and 150k do you draw the line?</TEXT>

Maybe we don't have professional sports or concerts but we allow small retailers to stay open and leave beaches and parks open. Everyone seems to think in black and white and only extremes. There is a middle ground Edit... so fixed my shitting down to shutting down but also had one more comment. Im in chicago trying to move down your guys way but here our pools aren't open beaches arent open even running trails and parks were shitdown. They even went as far as to block the electronics isle at walmart so you could shop for groceries but God forbid a TV or an Xbox game. I mention this because florida was a lot looser so just want to highlight how extreme shutdowns were in other areas. I personally find your guys shutdown much more reasonable. In chicago the situation is basically if an activity generates tax revenue its safe ie bars are open now but if it doesn't i3 beaches and parks its unsafe</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Not sure what you mean by you should be looking at nw burbs. Peoppe seem to be either south suburbs west suburbs or nw suburbs in terms of what they like and each are very different. I think most people tend to gravitate to one of these areas for either proximity to work or family. If your commuting downtown and have no connections to a particular area and want good train schedules and good schools anywhere along the bnsf is probably a decent option ie aurora naperville lisle downers etc. Brookfield is another great option thats easier on the wallet</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I agree I love Glen ellyn id rather live there than naperville but naperville has a better downtowm and more jobs. Regardless theres probably less than 3 burbs I can think of that can even come close to matching up to naperville in terms of the factors I mentioned. I think the reason naperville catches so much crap is its like the guy who buys the cheapest BMW 325 around and then wears a BMW hat and talks about his beamer all the time. Naperville has money but its not whinetka money so its kinda pathetic trying to flex. I will say pooping on naperville has become a knee jerk trend so now its just the running joke all be it kind of a lame one. Ome thing I will say is naperville is a joke with property taxes. Yeah you get a lot of services for your money but I have some clients who live in naperville and have for a while and they've seen their property taxes go fr like 6k to 13k or 15k in the time they've lived there. Thats over a grand a month before you've even paid a mortgage or utilities. Are nice parkway on 75th st and a good library worth a grand a month?</TEXT>

    <TEXT>This has always been my beef with shopify. I dont mind paying for a premium feature or niche feature but shopify a dedicated ecom platform lacks the ability to even run sales and promotions. You get coupon codes and one automatic discount. If i want to run multiple sales I need to get the ultimate special offers app which is glitchy and costs $20 bucks a month. Shopify doesn't have goal deals voluke deals upsets pretty basic features an ecom platform should have. Dont get me wrong i love shopify for many reasons but across 3 stores I spend 6k a month in apps and custom development. Bigcommerce is actually a superior platform but shopify did a better job of gaining users</TEXT>

    <TEXT>You made my poikt much more eloquently. The guy above needs internet for gaming. Well say he makes $10 an hour and internet is $70. He needs to work 7 hours to have that luxury. Now he could forgo gaming and take a walk in the park or get some library books for free and have 7 more hours of free time orayne its worth giving up 7 hours. I can agree food shelter and medical care maybe should be provided with you exerting no effort. Its a little stretch but we can probably work that. You getting to live in a super desirable area and have all todays luxuries and conveniences isnt gonna happen.

    <TEXT>Thats a big critique of shopify is for being a core ecom platform it lacks many basic features like even being able to run a sale you essentially need an app like ultimate special offers to do anything beyond a coupon code. I don't mind paying for premium services but as an ecom platform it should have basic ecom features. Big commerce is a better platform in terms of offering more out the box but shopify has made a bigger name for themselves</TEXT>

They may not make up the bulk of homeowners so maybe mortgages are less affected but they do buy consumer goods. As far as money management goes americans are bad at it. I regularly have people paying with link cards in front of me inline with nicer phones shoes and clothes than me and not picking on the poor most people I know are bad with money.

Most people i know and who I come across are not hiding under the ned they are going to the gym, getting together with friends but when you speak with someone who doesn't know you well they tip toe around their behavior and act concerned until they realize your like-minded and then open up with their tru feelings. The only way to get past this is civil disobedience on a mass scale and being very vocal with your thoughts so others aren't scared to not be terrified</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Yeah make money online and stocks high $20 range cpm isnt uncommon. You hear people say $1 or $2 cpm is the norm. Thats true for prank channels but for something niche and with a lot of companies that want to advertise it can get pretty high. Webull is paying influencers like $20 for a signup without a deposit i wanna say somewhere between $50 and $80 with a deposit so I imagine them and other brokers advertise a lot plus all the other youtubers pitching investing courses. Then you also got the crypto advertisers and high interest savings account banks who would hop in as well. I made almost 80k off one viral video years back about alibaba</TEXT>

    <TEXT>First off somethijg to consider is selling on a platform like Amazon merch redouble etc. You dont have as much control or personal branding but your also not dealing with returns or customer service or payment processors and while the margins aren't great neither is a shopify print full tee shirt store. Here's the situation you find yourself in now. Shopify is gonna charge you 2% extra on every tra section since your not using shopify payments. You'll also probably pay about $20 to $30 a month for a processor plus $12 to $30 for a payment gateway to connect said processor to shopify. PayPal would probably be the cheapest and easiest option</TEXT>

Also if someoke with a stolen card is gonna buy a TV they'll try to buy a cheap item first to make sure the card works. Then you alsp have friendly fraud where people do charge backs to get free stuff. Anyone of those scenarios is much more likely than someome committing fraud and wasting time and effort to knockout a brand new competitor who's sold all of 2 tee shirts one being to a family member and not even a real cistomer</TEXT>
