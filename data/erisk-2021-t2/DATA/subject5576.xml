    <TEXT>Honestly, they don't deserve to debut in Korea. If they can't respect those before them (Jennie-sunbaenim, we love you) that literally busted their asses off for YEARS, then they don't deserve to be in the industry. Point blank. It seems like they probably trained for a few months to at most a year. Watching a few of their stuff, they really lack charisma and synchronization on stage. Don't pull that rookie card bullshit on me either. You can still be a rookie, but exceptional at your craft. Why? Because it all comes back to the YEARS of training rookie groups put in before debut. Stuff like synchronization and charisma are the basics to being an idol. If you can't nail those, then you shouldn't debut. Also, singing a few lines in korean doesn't make it KPOP. Tyga collaborated with Bad Bunny in Loco Contigo, but you don't see Tyga going around claiming he's a Spanish artist. I don't get why a Spanish girl is giving herself a Korean name? Like okay, you love everything Korean related, but you still shouldn't give yourself a korean name. I'm Asian and I like tacos and tamales, should I just change my name to a spanish name?? Like wtf?? They're a big nope for me.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I got into SVT in July 2019. I remember having BTS MVs playing in the background as I was packing for my trip to Asia. One of the DWC stage performance auto played and I was immediately hooked. I downloaded the song onto my Spotify and the next day, I was on a plane to Asia. While I was in traveling Asia, DWC was the only song I had on repeat. I seriously listened to that song until my ears bled.  #128128; Funny thing was I didn #8217;t know ANYTHING about them at the time. Not even a member #8217;s name. I came back home in August and their Buzzfeed interview popped up. I watched it and immediately fell in love with their humor. I soon discovered how INSANELY talented they are. I found out that they were coming to LA for KCON. I was hesitant on buying tickets because I barely knew anything about them, but I ended up making a last minute decision to see them. I literally had the time of my life that day. I wholeheartedly stan them so hard and never regret it. They helped me face my biggest fears and got me through the darkest moments in life.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>No trick really. When I first started doing legendary raids, I was so bad at it. I kept throwing balls and missing. It #8217;s just luck and patience. You can throw a crappy ball and catch him or you can throw an excellent and have him still pop out. Take your time with it. Always feed it a golden razz and to aim for great or excellent throws. Throw the ball right after he attacks. Good luck!</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Keep aiming for great throws, but also try for excellent. The key is to really take your time with it. You want to make every ball count, so that means not throwing it on a whim and missing it because the legendary Pok #233;mon attacked or moved. It #8217;s all about patience. I remember my first few 5 star raids, I was rushing through it and the legendary got away. I started working on my excellent throws and I #8217;ve been catching practically every legendary. I also try to raid with my friends / virtual friends so I can get more pokeballs because of friendship level. TheTrainerClub on YouTube has a video on how to catch giratina! Also sometimes it #8217;s based on luck too  #128579;</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Definitely understand why there isn #8217;t one. There #8217;s a bunch of kids that play PoGo and also lots of adults. There are crazy people out there and there could be sexual predators that play too. But I think they should implement some type of chat system. Maybe something where you can #8217;t type words, but have a word bank to choose from like  #8220;raid? #8221;  #8220;yes #8221;  #8220;no #8221;  #8220;sorry #8221; of that sorts.

    <TEXT>Hi guys, I #8217;m a fairly new PoGo player. Started July 30, 2020 and I #8217;m currently level 33. I just caught my first shadow Mewtwo from the special research task and of course, I #8217;m familiar with how strong it is in its shadow form. I dumped a bunch of rare candies into him and powered him up a bit. My question is how do I get rid of frustration and how do I used TMs?  #128557;</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Not gonna lie but this worked for me. I saw this post while I was at my friend #8217;s house and kept it in mind. As I was exiting my friend #8217;s neighborhood, a bunch of Pok #233;mon spawned. A vulpix, houndour, poochyena, sandshrew, gulpin, and a few others. Since I was in my car, I didn #8217;t have time to sit there and shiny check each Pok #233;mon. I ended up choosing the houndour since it was the one facing me and it ended up being a shiny!! Lmao what are the odds. Thanks for the tip!</TEXT>

I used to toss a lot of my potions and revives away because they were taking up a lot of space, but because Team Rocket are showing up more often, I #8217;m always using them now.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Always golden razz that bitch. Do not rush through it. When I first started raiding, I would literally rush through it and wasted balls because I missed or the legendary mon attacked. You want to take your time  amp; make every single ball count. Excellent  gt; great  gt; nice throws. The best time to throw the ball is just before giratina finishes its attack. TheTrainerClub has a video on how to throw/catch for giratina. He uses the  #8220;circle lock technique. #8221; I don #8217;t use his technique but I take his advice on when to throw.
