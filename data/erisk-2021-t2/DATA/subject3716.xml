    <TEXT>Most people get discouraged because of the alphabet. But, honestly, is not even that hard to learn. Just make sure that you learn the correct pronunciation and not what some American scholars ASSUME is the correct pronunciation. Once you learn that, it is not that hard. Yes, there are genders for every word, but there are countless other languages like this. If you speak any other European language, Greek should be easy. I suggest [helinika.com](https://helinika.com) and their YouTube channel for learning Greek at home!</TEXT>

    <TEXT>First of all, you should start with the alphabet and the correct pronunciation (including the various letter combinations). Then divide your time between learning some basic vocabulary and basic grammar. After building a strong grammar and vocabulary foundation, start speaking with native speakers (eg join a tandem group). For free resources, I recommend [helinika.com](https://helinika.com) and its YouTube platform. Helinika has courses also on Udemy!</TEXT>

    <TEXT>It is just the shorter version - in my family, we would use " #949; #953; #962;  #965; #947; #949; #943; #945; #957;" instead (the old Greek version). It means "to health!".</TEXT>
