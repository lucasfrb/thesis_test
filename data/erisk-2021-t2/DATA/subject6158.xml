    <TEXT>US is the country with the highest number of deaths and cases right now, I understand the worry in the economy side. But 1. The US hasn #8217;t been in a full lockdown (watch Italy and Spain to see what a full lockdown is). 2. The US protests are demanding to get their freedom back; so they #8217;re not protesting about anything related to economy, they #8217;re just annoyingly speaking about freedom for being asked to stay home some weeks. Idk about you but a human life is priceless. If the sanitary system in the US is capable of handling that many cases then go ahead, open the streets, but if you have a collapse like EU countries have had then good luck. Yet again US healthcare is private so I wonder if the lack of healthcare collapse is due to people not affording it or an actual big enough system to take care of everyone</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Although I do not have an answer for you, I do suggest extensive research in locking mechanisms. There #8217;s is a very good YouTube channel called  #8220;LockPickingLawyer #8221; that (educationally) shows how secure different locks are. A common theme with electronic locks such as fingerprint ones is they are very easy to bypass. If anyone knows any secure ones that can help you, they can reply with suggestions. As far as I #8217;m aware, some e-locks are less secure than traditional ones because, although the fingerprint scanner is reliable, the mechanical bypass in case battery runs out is very very poor. And a lock is only as safe as its worst component.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Im comparing the events purely as deterrents. I know these riots are not comparable to WW1 and I never said they were. I explicitly said they both came at a time where the tensions were high enough that the death of a single person (be of an archduke or an ordinary man), led to violent events. And if you ask me, maybe not everyone is on this for the black lives matter movement, but I tell you many people are on board against the common enemy; the unjust system there #8217;s in place.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Hey guys I am in the process of wanting to install retroarch. I want to be able to chose the cores I want and not rely on the complete pack (due to some emulators which will never be used) to save on storage. I seen on retroarch website that you can download the whole pack or cores alone. I #8217;ve not found a guide for how to install the specific cores (I believe it is done using nightlies). As an example, say I want desmume core, from the website do I download desmume_libretro_libnx.nro.zip and that #8217;s it? Or do I need something else? My guess is I need retroarch_switch.nro.zip too but I am not sure (therefore asking). Thank you in advance.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>So I want to withdraw all my Bitcoin to an address. On my portfolio I can see the amount I own and everything is fine. When I go to press withdraw and chose crypto address, it says I have 0 available coins in my portfolio. I have tried with the mobile app, I have tried with the desktop website; nothing. I have also tried to try and send the coins to another portfolio and it also says 0 available. I am using coinbase pro and trying to send it to normal coinbase, it also says 0 available. I have tried looking in the help section but nothing appears, the phone contact number is only for account compromises so nothing there either. Anyone has any advice or solutions?</TEXT>

    <TITLE>Case Recommendation</TITLE>
    <DATE>2020-10-19 10:37:25</DATE>
    <TEXT>Hello guys, I have been browsing everywhere, looking at the excel case list and doing my own research. I want to build myself a new pc, abs because I switch between countries every university vacation, I was looking into getting a SFF that I could take with me. Ideally I would like to carry the pc under the seat in front of me on the plane, rather than the cabin overhead. Since I fly Ryanair nearly every single time, I restricted the dimensions to their policy. These dimensions are 40x25x20 cm. I know there are quite a few cases out there but I am in quite a budget so I would like the case to be a bit under 100$. I can purchase in UK or Spain so my real budget would be 70 #8364;/65 #163;/80$. I have looked at TaoBao and there #8217;s a [case](https://www.google.com/amp/s/www.taobao.com/list/item-amp/607160196997.htm) I really like but the shipping to UK just doubles the price. So TaoBao is annoyingly a NO from me due to not living in a country that it can be shipped to directly. My thoughts on the hardware: Motherboard any m-itx CPU ryzen 5 3600 GPU rtx 3070 PSU ideally ATX but can consider SFX if only option COOLING I have heard airports don #8217;t mind AIO so that is a possibility I #8217;m shuffling, if not, it would all be air cooling. CPU cooler height Im not too bothered since there are a few options. My main requisite is get a case that can accommodate all comfortably whilst still be able to take it with me. Thank you guys.</TEXT>
