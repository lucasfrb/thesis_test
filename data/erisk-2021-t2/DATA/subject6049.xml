    <TITLE>Actex Exams for exam P!</TITLE>
    <DATE>2019-11-18 07:28:51</DATE>
    <TEXT>Hello guys, hope you find this in your good health. Im currently studying for exam P and was going through the actex exams, things were really cool until Actex Exam 8. Some questions on that were super difficult for me. Keep in mind i have done all SOA sample questions. So i was wondering is the exam generally as hard as Actex Exam 8? Also, IF you have done both actex exams and adapt, what EL do you think Actex Exam 8 is? Should i still go for Adapt? Thankyou for reading this.  #10084; #65039;</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Failing exam P is very common, so dont go so hard on yourself. I actually had a very similar experience as you in my first sitting but for studying for the second time for Exam P i realized that I really didn #8217;t practice enough problems. Take some rest, and then start practicing alot. SOA #8217;s sample, 8 Actex Exams, ASM exams. You should have practice of atleast 1000-1200 questions to know just enough to pass P. Best of luck. :)</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Hello, good people. Hope this post find you in your good health. I am studying for exam P and hoping to appear in January examination session. I am done with SOA samples, Actex Exams 1-8. So i decided before going for Adapt ill go through ASM exams too, it was okay until exam 6 came along. I am really struggling in this exam. Most of the stuff is so new (which is surprising because i have done around 600 questions already) and is so difficult. My question is that do SOA exam are really this hard? Or even harder? This is demoralising me and is making me think I shouldn #8217;t sit for january exam. Please guide. Thankyou. Really depressed. Sorry if there is any grammatical mistake.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Hello. I #8217;m sorry if this seems low effort to you. I only wanted flash cards because im currently grinding on practice problems so much that even going to sleep makes me feel guilty. Hence I thought having flash cards and reading them while going to bed would make me less panic. Also if it is the fact that i asked those flash cards to be free then just know that i belong to a 3rd world country and have already spent my 2 months salary on registration and ADAPT and cant afford failure. Anyways, thankyou for nothing.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Apart from Adapt which, in my opinion, shouldnt be used till last month of exam, there are plenty of practice materials. You can easily find: SOA sample 333. 8 Actex practice exams. 20 ASM practice exams. 4 TIA Exams. These might look alot but you have aloooot of time to easily learn these exams and get comfortable with your sitting. The only way to pass exam P is to practice as much as you can. P.S. dont take practice exams under exam conditions.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Sorry for late reply. The reason i said that because taking me practice exam under exam conditions would only be sensible if you were fully prepared. Relax yourself and instead of doing 30 questions in 3 hrs. Give them the whole day and review every question. You can take adapt exams later under exam conditions. Dont worry about how long youre putting in one question because right now youre just learning the mechanics. Best of luck.</TEXT>

    <TITLE>Why do people fail FM?</TITLE>
    <DATE>2020-10-08 09:42:36</DATE>
    <TEXT>Hi, I **passed** my P exam in January, and since July have been studying for my FM exam. I was supposed to sit for the exam in October but due to covid-19, it was postponed till December which means I have a lot more time to prepare. However, unlike Exam P the syllabus of FM is way easier and all the questions are really way easier to solve. Very rarely I have to look at solutions to the questions. Now, all this made me super confident about my exam until I recently met a few of my seniors who all had to sit for FM at least twice or more. This made me question if there is something that I am missing in my preparation? Has anyone who has failed FM on their first try after feeling super confident guide me what more should I do to ensure I pass FM on my first try? TIA! Edit: I am sorry if someone find this offensive, I honestly didnt mean to at all. I passed exam P on my second attempt and since I live in a 3rd world country and cover all my expenses myself I want to avoid any sort of chance of failing FM like i failed P. Still, i apologise.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>you know what, thank you. You were right. I downloaded the 2018 SOA sample thinking it would be the most updated one (Since they removed SF in 2017). Thank you, brother</TEXT>
