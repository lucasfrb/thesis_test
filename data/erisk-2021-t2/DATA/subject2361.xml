    <TEXT>Hello people. I'm writing here because I have problems with my """home cinema""". I have a really old NEC projector (HT410) wich I have connected via VGA to my computer and i stream the audio with a bluetooth transmitter to my bluetooth speaker Ultimate Ears wonderboom 2. I'm searching and trying everything I know to try to synch the audio with the video (audio come a little bit later) but I can't seem to make the audio come early nor the video come later. Can anyone help me?</TEXT>

    <TITLE>Psychology in Germany</TITLE>
    <DATE>2020-04-25 12:37:40</DATE>
    <TEXT>Hello everyone! My name is Valentino and i'm 24 y/o. I'm from Italy but I'm living in Germany (N #252;rnberg) right now. I have an Italian Bachelor degree in Psychology and I would like to ask some questions about Psychology and Germany. I would like to make my Master here in Germany (not in N #252;rnberg) but I would like first to make some practical experiences in the field of Psychology (I don't want to choose the "wrong" field). The fact is that I really can't find any job opportunities for me and I don't know what to do. Does someone know maybe if in other cities of Germany is the same soup? Btw I'm studying in a German language course and right now I have finished A2, but actually I'm probably B1-B2. Hope that someone can help me.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Thank you for the answer. I will try to contact clinics etc. I know that a Bachelor is nothing in fact I want and I will continue my studies. The problem is that in Italy (idk if it #8217;s the same in the rest of the EU/World) we don #8217;t do ANY practical experience in university. The highest practical experience that they made us do is learning to use Excel for transcribing some Psicometry problems, and write a final Thesis (not an empirical one). How can I know that I want to make  #8220;X #8221; Master?</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Hello People! I study the German language since October 2019 and right now I've finished course A2 (actually I've finished it in middle March but with covid pandemic every course has stopped). I think I have more knowledge than A2 (or at least more knowledge of my colleagues). I've read all the "Dino lernt Deutsch" without any kind of problems and I usually read news in German (with a little bit of problem, mainly word vocabulary). I would love to improve myself as much as possible so I was thinking to start a TV series. Right now I only know 2 names: Dark and How to sell drugs online. There is any chance I could follow one of this 2? Wich one do you reccomand? Obviously with German subtitles. Thank you in advance. P.S. I have "only" Netflix and PrimeVideos.</TEXT>

    <TITLE>Best self study Book/Course</TITLE>
    <DATE>2020-05-10 16:55:19</DATE>
    <TEXT>Hi everyone! I want to ask you all some advices for the best (or the bests) self study German course/book in the market. I followed a German language course in Germany from A1 to the beginning of B1 but with this pandemic every course got cancelled. For that I decided to continue the study by myself but the most of books are structured for Courses with groups of people. P.S. I don't know if it's helpful but I used the "Schritte" series in my course and I loved it but it's structured obviously for a group of people. I found [this](https://www.amazon.de/-/en/Hueber-Sprachkurs-Deutsch-Englische-Ausgabe/dp/3192494751/ref=sr_1_1?dchild=1 amp;keywords=german+b1+self+study amp;qid=1589131628 amp;sr=8-1) but it has no review ect.</TEXT>

    <TITLE>Too many paths [EU][Germany]</TITLE>
    <DATE>2020-10-19 10:39:44</DATE>
    <TEXT>Hi people, I #8217;m 24 y/o and last year I finished my bachelor #8217;s degree in psychology in Italy. I #8217;ve moved to Germany because I wanted to live elsewhere and Germany seems a great option. I finally found a job as Assistant technical psychologist in a private clinic and now I #8217;m wondering what will be my next step. I, as I #8217;m sure everyone here, love psychology from the bottom of my heart, any field it #8217;s really beautiful for me and that #8217;s the reason of my indecision. I mostly love the Cognitive, Neuro-cognitive and Behavioural aspects of psychology, but I #8217;m also really curious about clinical psychotherapist and so on. Also, and I know that all of what I #8217;m saying is part of different paths, I #8217;m really interested in Human Resources and in general the psychology inside big company (especially Tech company). Working in this clinic it #8217;s nice, because I #8217;m working at least in a field where I belong, but it #8217;s too little for me! I get bored after a while always to use software with patients because I feel that I #8217;m not having that big of an impact. I would love to continue my studies but I have no idea how to chose a path, the right path. During my life I developed one of my greatest fear: taking the wrong path and wasting time (which I know it #8217;s never wasted of course, but I think you know what I mean), for that I #8217;m speaking to all of you hoping that I could find help. I #8217;m so sorry for the long post and I wish all of you people a great day!</TEXT>
