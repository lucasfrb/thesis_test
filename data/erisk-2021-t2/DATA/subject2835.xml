    <TITLE>Which the you like better: the Bleach manga or anime?</TITLE>
    <DATE>2016-04-09 15:52:48</DATE>
    <TEXT>so, Bleach is one of the mangas for which a continuation of the anime is most requested. My feelings about the anime are kinda mixed, so I wanted to ask ye of r/Bleach: which do you like better- the manga or the anime? Now, to make things more interesting, I'm asking two things: first, which would you like better, assuming the anime got picked up again and caught up to the manga- in the same quality that we usually got when it was still running (so don't answer based on, say, the last episode on which they poured the remaining animation budget). Second, which would you like better if it got picked up by a studio of your choice? For me, I'd probably like the manga better on both counts. I'm just much more of a manga person and really didn't like the anime as much as I did the manga. It could be kinda cool if Bones picked it up, but last I checked, they don't really do shows this long.</TEXT>

    <TITLE>[PSX][early 2000s] Anime-esque third person mech game</TITLE>
    <DATE>2016-04-17 13:16:17</DATE>
    <TEXT>**Platform(s):** PSX **Genre:** Mecha, third-person fighting game **Estimated year of release:** probably late 90s **Graphics/art style:**PSX 3d **Notable characters:** The first mech you play story mode with was blue, the second one was white. There were also three ghost ladies. At least, I think they were ghosts, I don't speak japanese and at the time I was sure it was russian (I was 6-8) **Notable gameplay mechanics:** Basically, you had two modes, and each one was a fight against one other mech. One mode had you using a humanoid mech, the other used that mech's airplane form. In both modes, you would use circle to fire missiles, triangle to use your gun, and X to use a melee attack. You could also fly for a limited time by hitting one of the R buttons. **Other details:** I can only remember vague plot details, but... (spoilers) at the end of the first story, in which you play the blue mech, the pilot tries chasing another plane into space and his head explodes. The second one ends with an extrememly annoyinh sequence in which you, as the white plane, try to dodge annoying red lasers.</TEXT>

    <TITLE>My pet and friend of 15 years is gone, and I'm kinda breaking down</TITLE>
    <DATE>2016-04-27 21:16:11</DATE>
    <TEXT>It happened last week. I didn't want to make a post about it at the time because I thought it would dishonor her memory or interfere with my recovery process or something. We put our family dog to sleep. Anyway, we picked her up from a shelter 15 years ago. I was a little kid at the time and she was 1 year old. I remember very little before her (mostly because I have crappy memory of elementary school). It's because she started sleeping on my bed that I can sleep in total darkness. She's what kept me bright during military service, high school, and this first year of university. I just can't believe she's not here anymore. Her spot feels empty. The whole family house feels empty. There's never been a time in the last 15 years when I would come home and there would be nobody there. She's been getting physically less and less well for a while. She was completely deaf, could barely see, and even her sense of smell wasn't completely functional. The vet said she probably had a stroke, because she became disoriented towards the end, had a hard time standing, kept falling over and started going number 1s and 2s on the floor, and, at the very last weeks, in her own spot. I know it's a bit selfish, but if I could just hug her again, I wouldn't mind cleaning up after her a million more times. I have no idea if she would have been okay knowing we were going to put her to sleep. The vet said it was time, and we know she was suffering, but she was still eating and drinking, which makes me think maybe she still wanted to go on. And I miss her so much. This happened last week. There's a holiday vacation from the university which ends next week. I've hardly touched any learning material, and we have stuff to hand over next month. I can't focus. I don't have a lot of motivation right now. I still cry around twice a day thinking about her. And I know I have to get going. Ugh, sorry to throw this at you, Reddit. I just had to let it out. Thanks for reading this wall of text.</TEXT>

    <TITLE>[UBW+HF+Fate Spoilers] Was Archer bluffing when...?</TITLE>
    <DATE>2016-07-18 18:42:00</DATE>
    <TEXT>So, Archer claims to have been able to replicate an imperfect Excalibur. That part we know for sure was not a bluff because Shirou did it in Heaven's Feel. What I feel may have been a bluff was his claim that if his replicated version and the real thing clashed, Saber, Rin and Shirou would have all died. I mean, I guess I could buy that Shriou and Rin would die, but even that's a bit questionable since Shirou lives to tell the tale of seeing Bellerophon and Excalibur clash (with Rho Aias not even protecting him personally). That the clash would have killed Saber strikes me as unlikely: the clash between Ea and Excalibur didn't kill her, so unless two holy swords clashing produces some crazy resonance effect, I don't see why that would be enough.</TEXT>

    <TITLE>Could FSN Gilgamesh destroy the Earth? (potential VN spoilers)</TITLE>
    <DATE>2016-08-01 20:45:59</DATE>
    <TEXT>I'm pretty sure that even if he could, he wouldn't use Ea for that purpose, using it to kill loads of people he considers to be a waste of space would be marginalizing it when we know that in many circumstances he'd probably rather die than use it. So this would be why he doesn't use it to destroy the Earth in UBW and instead decides to use the Grail to do it. Say that he decided to do it, though, could he? Even assuming that nobody such as Zelretch or the Dead Apostles or any of the other powerhouses of the Nasuverse stop him, would Ea be capable of destroying Earth? I'm not sure. In Fate, we're told he goes all out for his last attack, but the planet lives. But might this have been because the attack was blocked by Avalon before it could properly work its magic? What do you guys think?</TEXT>

    <TITLE>I have a few newbish questions about the Avengers...</TITLE>
    <DATE>2016-08-07 10:22:18</DATE>
    <TEXT>So I recently started reading comics, and I have a few things that seriously bug me about the Avengers. I read AvX and what we got so far from Civil War 2, and these is my question: To what or who are the Avengers beholden? What happens when they commit crimes? Because they occasionally do things that strike me as criminal (Tony's kidnapping of Ulysses, the Avengers deciding to deal with the Phoenix Five without checking out public consensus...), and yet nobody ever mentions them. Based on what directions do the Avengers act? They're obviously not an elected group. How do they decide what to do? Because a few times now, having read some other series in which the Avengers appeared, they just come out of the sky, start pointing fingers, meddle with people's affairs (*ahem* Thor destroying factories cuz he decided to be for the environment before he knew anything about Minotaur), and beat the shit out of people. I know I shouldn't apply realism to comic books, but thinking about a group like this acting independently in the real world is creepy (then again, so is having supervillains around, so...).</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Hi, r/sextoys. I've never posted here before, but I figured this would be appropriate here. So, recently, I've become interested specifically in the kinds of cock rings that come with prostate plugs. Thing is, I don't know the first thing about them. I'll probably be ordering from Amazon and I wouldn't mind paying up to around 40$. So: are they any good? What do cock rings do? What do testicle rings do? Do any of them affect fertility somehow (assuming you never wear them for more than 30 minutes)? What are the best ones? If you only use them to masturbate, would you think they would affect your sex life with your partner? How do I introduce my girlfriend to the idea of using one? We've already spoken about using sex toys and she's fine with the idea but I wouldn't mind keeping it to myself. Yup. Lots of questions. Thanks for your time.</TEXT>

    <DATE>2016-09-06 21:28:03</DATE>
    <TEXT>Hi, r/dogs. This is my first time posting here. Not sure why. Anyway, here's the deal. I live with my parents, and a few months ago they got a 2.5 months old puppy. That was three months after out family dog passed away, having been with us for 15 years and for most of my life. I told myself that this new guy would be my parents' dog, not mine, that I would distance myself from big decisions regarding him, because the wound was still fresh and such. It hurt like a sonuvabitch when my old girl died, I didn't feel like going through that again in another decade an a half. That's what I told myself. But I'm just a guy, so that failed horribly and I love the little pain in the ass to death. My parents didn't quite grasp how much work a puppy was (I did warn them, didn't help), but he's pretty reasonable in my opinion. For a puppy. He is now about 5 months old. The vet's office is supposed to call us at some point when it's neutering time. Which should be soon. And I can't shake the feeling that we'll be mutilating this little dog baby. I mean, he's so tiny. And he trusts us. He has no idea that it's going to happen. And I feel like, if we can make absolutely sure that he'll never mate, where's the harm in not doing it? I know there are reasons. I'm here to get into the "neuter you dog" boat. Sell me on the idea. Thanks!</TEXT>

    <TITLE>How is the release of the Terrigen Cloud viewed by the Marvel world?</TITLE>
    <DATE>2016-09-12 09:50:46</DATE>
    <TEXT>Full disclosure: I'm an X-Men fan who recently discovered that Inhuman series are both cool and have really good art style. Okay, so here's my question. Black Bolt released the Terrigen Cloud to help the Inhumans, right? And while he probably didn't know how it would affect Mutants, A. tons of people are dying and/or have already died because of it nonetheless and B. Lash's point that some control is needed is, as far as I can tell, true. You can't go around handing out the equivalents of fireball shooters to random people. It's incredibly irresponsible. Has Black Bolt been, say, put to trial because of this? (I honestly don't know, I'm kind of drowning in stuff to read) How does the rest of the world (excluding the Inhumans, at least Medusa's view on the whole thing is pretty clear. And, uh... shall we say, one-dimensional)? Is it viewed as a bug or as a feature? And, finally, has any attempts been made to contain the cloud? I mean, I'm pretty sure that enough telekinetics or weather control people could probably put it away. It's not ethereal or anything. Although I'm sure that would cause a big clash with the Inhumans.</TEXT>

    <TITLE>What's up with the anti-Phoenix-ism in AvX?</TITLE>
    <DATE>2016-09-18 12:59:17</DATE>
    <TEXT>So, I just finished a second read of AvX. Not my favorite Marvel story, but as far as big events go, at least it's not too convoluted (I'm looking at you, Battle of the Atom) and has some interesting themes. But one thing that bugs me about it is how not a single character in the whole world seems to remember what a Phoenix host who is in control is like. For some reason, people only remember Dark Phoenix Jean, even though she was in control of the Phoenix Force more often than not (I mean, she didn't have access to the whole thing, but still). People give Wanda more credit, even though she probably caused the Earth more damage in general. And then, this douchebag, Tony Stark, goes and tries to kill it. I swear, when he went "Guys, did I just kill the Phoenix?" I wished someone had been there to slap him in the face real hard. In all likelihood, if the Phoenix died, that would have been a really shitty thing to have happened for the whole universe. Also, for future universes. What the fiery fuck? Is there nobody in either the Avengers or X-Men teams who knows what the Phoenix actually is? Phew. Had to vent that for a while. Thanks for reading! Note: I'm only talking about AvX up to part 5. After that, the Avengers' response is a bit more justified, at least in my eyes.</TEXT>

    <TITLE>What are good X-Men titles?</TITLE>
    <DATE>2016-09-21 14:33:37</DATE>
    <TEXT>Full disclosure: I'm a manga fan who only recently discovered that most what I thought about American comics wasn't true, and that they're actually pretty good. However, I'm not too keen on a lot of Marvel stuff (I absolutely despise the Avengers and hate Steve Rogers and Stony Ark with a burning passion), and as this post's title suggests, I'm a huge X-Men fan. I'm not sure what it is I have against the Avengers. They feel... condenscending, somehow. Anyway, I was probably hooked on X-Men stuff since I watched the old, old animated series as a kid. And I get the impression that my reading order has been horrible. The very first thing I read from start to finish was AvX, which I both liked and hated (had interesting theme, but had a lot of problems, too). Then I began reading All-New X-Men, which I kind of liked, especially because I found out that Jean Grey wasn't this horribly shallow character that the movies and animated series made her appear to be. But it was ridiculously convoluted. Same problem with Extraordinary X-Men. And just recently I began reading New X-Men, specifically the Casandra Nova bit and then the Magneto/Xorn bit. And it was amazing. Gave me everything I wanted from a comic book plotline (also, Beast was in it, which is always a plus). Both plotlines ended pretty neatly without leaving huge loose ends. Now, that's not all that I've read, but it's all that I've read in the last 10 years (I read some Unlimited X-Men as a kid, and the Dark Phoenix Saga). What other X-Men titles are out there that don't feel like they have to feature the Avengers or the Guardians of the Galaxy prominently, that are not stupidly convoluted and that close up nicely at the end of story arcs? ...Also, I know that it's a long shot, but if there are any other series with the late New X-Men cast (Beast, Cyclops, Emma, Jean, Wolverine, Xavier...) I'd be happy to know. Thanks!</TEXT>

    <TITLE>Exalted system bloat- how big is it?</TITLE>
    <DATE>2016-09-24 13:20:39</DATE>
    <TEXT>Hi, guys. First time posting on this subreddit. So, here's the deal. I used to run Exalted 2e for a couple of players, who are both very involved players who really like to play gods and remake any railroads I put before them into Ferris wheels. Naturally, it went horribly, because 2e is broken as hell, we did not enjoy rolling over 9000 dice, and designing encounters was a chore from Hell. I put the game on hiatus, thinking I could rebuild Exalted using Fate or Gurps. Except Gurps is at least, if not more bloated than Exalted is, and the Fate core rulebook was by far the most boring read I ever got out of a roleplaying book. Later on, though, I found Fudge, and while it is very much to my liking, I found that the book purposely leaves some stuff out for you to fill, to the point that if I want to remake Charms, 99% of the balancing of that attempt is going to be winging it. Lately, I've been on a roll with this, and I got this surge of neat ideas, so I think I'll probably have it done in another two months or so. So, mostly to get some more inspiration out of new Exalted stuff, I got Exalted 3e. It's still a very fat system. I like crunch as much as the next person, but I don't think there's any excuse for a core rulebook that still focuses mostly on one type of Exalted to be close to 700 pages long. Especially because so much of it focuses on the mechanics themselves. I'm probably still going to try running the game with my custom Fudge rules, but I want to hear some opinions from people who have played 3e (whether you liked it or not): is it good? Is it fun for people who stand somewhere on the middle between liking to mess with numbers and enjoying an immersive story? Is the system really not that titanic and is the absurd page count just messing with my head?</TEXT>

    <DATE>2017-01-24 13:48:14</DATE>
    <TEXT>So, basically, I want to start a game using 5e. I kind of like the mechanics, and they seem at least a bit more stable compared with 3.5 (never played 4e and Pathfinder struck me as having exactly the same issues as 3.5e). Now, I have this friend who knows a fuckton about statistics. And I love him and everything, but when we spoke about the system, he was suuuuuuuper negative about using D  amp; D. He explained to me that the system is still broken, that a Fighter will still feel shit compared to a spellcaster, and that we will often need to either ignore of fiddle with a lot of rules. And I currently don't have time to spend on both running a game *and* fiddling with mechanics. And I'm now at a point in which I'm a bit terrified of using 5e because it might frustrate a lot of players who just want to roleplay. I mean, I love the guy, but he has a *lot* of baggage about D  amp; D, and I did not need all that negativity. So, is the system that broken, or can I count on it to function without getting in the way (or, dare I hope, *support*) roleplaying? Edit: Jeez, I did not expect to get this many replies. Thanks, guys. I just want to be clear on something- my friend has only good intentions in regards to our group. He had a lot of hard time with many, many systems, and I think his taste is currently gravitating heavily towards rules-light sandbox-y systems. He's a great guy and I don't want to run the game without him. And what I meant when I said "roleplay" was going through a shared story while respresenting what you want your character to be, without the mechanics getting in the way of that.</TEXT>

We like having *some* mechanics as a way to add suspense and because not having any is a whole other can of worms we don't want to open, but many of us won't read a system that's more than a dozen pages long. So this basically rules out FATE (which I also don't like, for a rules-light system it sure has a big page count, a lot of which is necessary to get even a general idea of how to play), D  amp; D, GURPS, Hero System, and the actual WFRP system. I kind of like Fudge, but I'm mostly currently looking at Simple D6. Do you guys have any suggestions for other rules-light systems?</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Hi, guys. So, as a guy who always loved Exalted (but who hated the system with a passion, and 3e doesn't strike me as much better), I was pretty curious about Godbound. And I now wonder if it could be good for our group. Thing is, most of us aren't very mechanically-oriented. Maybe 3/6 of us can wrap our heads around mechanics soundly, but only 2/6 of us actively enjoy that particular part of roleplaying. The rest of us are indifferent to it. So how crunchy is Godbound, exactly? And how balanced/broken is it? Because I tried running Exalted 2e once. I read through all of the Errata to make sure I could run a balanced game. It went horribly and I am now terrified of making the time investment required to learn now systems that are over a few dozen pages long. Also, exactly how much work would you say is required to maintain a Godbound campaign? Does it take the Exalted approach of "make up villains that you feel are vaguely as powerful as the PCs and pray they are neither secretly scrubs or will cause a TPK", or is it easier to create stuff? And to exactly what degree are players required to pore through loads of crunch? Because while I could and would maybe even enjoy doing that, as I've mentioned, most of my group would have a terrible time doing that (although most of us are familiar with d20 systems, for what that's worth in the context of Godbound). ...I really hope I'm not bashing on Exalted too much here. Because I really do love the setting, but the rules have nearly made me cry on a number of occasions. Thanks!</TEXT>

    <DATE>2017-04-04 08:41:43</DATE>
    <TEXT>So, as we all know, some players like having very perceptive/tough/whatever characters. The issue, at least for me, is that it's difficult to make these PCs engaging without making players lazy. Say you have a character with a lot of awareness. Because the ability is at least somewhat passive, you run the risk that that player will get laid back and expect to get dazzling results and know everything without even trying. How do you get over that? How do you make abilities that are more passive by nature engaging, how do you get them to reward players' *actions*? Especially in systems in which you don't have supernatural passive abilities that require activation. These system kind of solve this by giving characters cool powers that *require action to work*.</TEXT>

Some context: I'm running a game using broad skills (15 points at character creation), using u/abc_z 's skill list, meaning we don't have attributes. We also don't have scaling skill costs- it costs exactly as much to raise a skill from Good to Great as it does to raise one from Superb to Legendary. So how many broad skill points would you say a reroll on one such skill is worth? Assuming you get to pick the better roll, and that we're rolling 4df, as usual.

And yet, what they actually do is never explained beyond that it helps define traits that don't fit into the normal trait ladder. This explanation seems a bit faulty to me- almost anything can be a skill in my opinion. But also, the stuff the book actually lists as gifts is pretty underwhelming to me. At some point it lists Tough Hide as a gift which provides +1 to damage capacity. That doesn't seem like a good deal for six skill levels. So in my game, Gifts act as specific bonuses to traits. The broader the gift, the less significant its bonus will be, but it will of course come up more often. A narrow gift, however, can grant exceptionally large bonuses. So, say, a Courageous gift could make a character almost completely immune to fear (unless she was faced with a character with a similar gift, such as a Terrifying person, or if she was up against someone who actually had six skill ranks above her mental defense trait). So what do gifts do in your game? If you think they should work differently from skills, how do you put prices on them?</TEXT>

    <TITLE>Alternative, easy ways to balance ranged combat?</TITLE>
    <DATE>2017-05-23 05:34:38</DATE>
    <TEXT>So I think the default Fudge way to balance out the inherent advantage of ranged combat is kind of meh. You don't add your relevant attribute/skill to your offensive damage factor. This essentially means ranged combatants will be next to useless against anything that has a mildly high damage resistance/armor. It very nearly goes into D  amp; D archer levels of uselessness. But mostly, it makes ranged combat significantly less fun in my opnion- as an archer, for example, you would only very rarely do massive damage to anyone, and that isn't very satisfying (compared with the thrill a melee fighter would get when he would down someone in a single swing). And we're playing WFRP so the most powerful ranged weapons are +3-ish damage tops, so I can't just give my players bigger guns. One alternative to this would probably be cover, which would subtract from the ranged combatant's ranged combat skill (like a shield would). Also, ranged fighters would suffer a hefty penalty when firing into or from melee (-2 or something). There could also be the matter of ammo, but honestly ammo tracking is rarely ever fun, so this particular disadvantage probably shouldn't come up too often (it's also highly irrelevant for magic). Thing is, I'm not sure if these disadvantages quite make up for the benefit of range. So does anybody have any other ideas of how to limit ranged weapons without nerfing them to the point of uselessness? Edit: I had a whole paragraph in the wrong place. Wtf brain. Double edit: I think the solution I like best really is to wing it and come up with appropriate situational modifiers to make sure both abilities are of roughly equal utility. In games with more advances ranged weapons, I think it might be worth to consider pricing these two skills differently, because ranged combat may honestly be better than melee. But in games with equally advanced melee weapons and armor to make up for that difference (such as Warhammer 40k), you probably wouldn't have to do that.</TEXT>

    <TITLE>Rules-light to rules-tight and vice-versa</TITLE>
    <DATE>2017-05-25 20:27:37</DATE>
    <TEXT>Hi, guys. So basically, I've been wondering how many of us have decided to move from crunchy systems to lighter ones, or (more interestingly in my opinion because I haven't heard many experiences of this variety) the other way around. So share your stories! Which systems did you switch from and to, and why did you do it? I'll start. I used to DM Exalted 2e (dun dun dunn). It was pretty fun for a while. I liked *reading* numbers and Charms for that system, and it was only for two guys, meaning I didn't have to deal with five people's worth of Solar Charms. But eventually, it became too much. Not only did I realize that creating interesting non-fodder opposition using the rules as written was virtually impossible without encyclopedic knowledge of Charm lists and precisely how potent each Charm combination was in correlation to the PCs', but also, I got sick and tired of how slow action resolution was. A while later, I was introduced to Fudge by a friend. I tried Fate, but felt a bit cheated by the system's pretense of rules-lightness in light of its high page count. So Fudge. I made a WFRP hack for it (with much appreciated help from abcd_z), and honestly, most of my players like it so far. Even before then, we played a Dark Heresy game with a custom system a friend had made, and we all love the simplification. Effectively, with less rules, we get to have more freeform variation of the rules we do have, which I find to be more interesting than when a game explicitly tells you with agonizing details the exact result of every situation possible under the sun. Just to be clear- I still like *reading* crunchy systems. There's a certain beauty in the way roleplaying numbers combine to create interesting characters. But functionally, as a method of cooperative storytelling, I don't find these systems to be very appealing.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Besides Godbound, Fate and Mutants  amp; Masterminds. See, I really like the setting and the tone the game claims to be able to provide, but I hate the system with a burning passion. I used to run 2e. It was a cluncky nightmare. And having read 3e, I honestly can't say I'm particularly impressed. It's still a very, very slow system with way too many moving parts for its own good. Any system in which a common advice for GMs is to "just ignore most of the rules" is not a good one in my book. And I can't believe we still don't have a formula about Charm creation, and that in order to figure out mote-for-benefit ratios, we *still* have to look through hundreds of Charms. Okay, angry rant out. So I'm obviously not very happy with the system. What other system is there that can simulate Charms in a satifying way without being as slow as Exalted?</TEXT>

    <TITLE>How do you make jacks-of-all-trades or dippers shine?</TITLE>
    <DATE>2017-08-18 17:15:51</DATE>
    <TEXT>Yo, r/rpg. So I've DM'd on and off for a while now, and recently I've started DMing a WFRP game using Fudge RPG. But I feel like this issue is relevant for a lot of games. And the issue is this: in our game, most characters specialize in one or two fields (such as melee combat or stealth or economics or what have you) and invest the rest of their character creation points in other skills, but to a lesser degree than they do their specialties. Which leads us to the first issue. 1. how do you make dips feel meaningful even when you have a specialist for the relevant thing in the party, without separating the party? Example: One player invests a lot in Perception. So, obviously, she should get the value she invested in that to be the authority on all things Perception in the party. But other characters also make investments in Perception. How do you make them feel like they're not just tossing their resources away while also not making the specialist feel cheated? Yes, you could separate the party, but that just slows games down in my experience and I like the interactions our party has a whole much better. 2. One character in our party is made up of just that- lots of dips in lots of skills, without specializing too much in any one thing. So basically this is the same issue as the one above expect in a more concentrated form. The chance to roll and get interesting results probably solves this problem a little bit. A thief with +1 to thieving may not usually get to rival a thief with +6, but he could occasionally roll really well and still end up competitive. So, other than that- any ideas?</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Hello, r/Marvel. So. Big X-Men fan over here. I really got into the franchise with New X-Men, which blew me away. And the omnibus wasn't too expensive, either, so of course I had to get that. So I obviously wanted to try Joss Whedon's Astonishing run. My girlfriend got me the first two volumes when she was in the US (you guys have no idea how cheap comic books are where you live, they can get crazy expensive where I live). It's great. But while browsing through Amazon to see how many volumes I would need to complete the series, I kinda found out that at volume 5, they change authors, and it dips into... Messiah Complex. And I *hate* event tie-ins. And Messiah is even worse because it ties into AvX later on, which I *really* hate. So I was wondering- is the series still good past volume 4? Does it hold up by its own like the other volumes, or is Messiah Complex basically required reading for it? Would the first four volumes make the series feel whole or is the actual conclusion later on? Thanks!</TEXT>

    <TITLE>What's the appeal in following Kratos throughout these games?</TITLE>
    <DATE>2017-10-01 15:20:00</DATE>
    <TEXT>As the title asks. I've played all GoW games, but boy did the story ever frustrate the living shit out of me. See, the gameplay is great. Graphics? Check. Music? Check. But following this guy around was just incredibly frustrating. I could get behind his motivation in the first game. He was a flawed hero, did some terrible things, but he also had some sympathetic qualities. But all of that goes out the window by the third game. By that point, at least for me, Kratos was an irredeemable, condescending, entitled prick that I really wanted to die. He destroyed the world, for crying out loud, and yet the game somehow tries to portray him positively at the very last scene by having him be the one to release "hope" into the world? I very much doubt all those people who died because he caused all of these worldwide calamities will appeicate that. And so, it's infuriating to me that that guy somehow gets a "happily ever after", at least seemingly, at the start of the next game. Because he doesn't deserve it. He has to pay for the thing he's done. And he just got off scott free. So, for me, as you can see, the biggest point of contention was that Kratos was a terrible person that I really wanted to suffer the consequences of the shit he's done. But am I missing something here? The series is successful. Clearly a lot of other people aren't very frustrated with him. So to all of you who made it through these games without wanting to pluck out that bastard's eyes, would you care to explain what is appealing about his character?</TEXT>

    <TITLE>How do you deal with permanent damage, balance-wise?</TITLE>
    <DATE>2017-11-16 07:57:48</DATE>
    <TEXT>Hello, fellow roleplayers. So, in some games, risking permanent damage is a big deal, and a major part of the fun. In Warhammer, if you open fishy chests or try to fight something you shouldn't, you could risk growing tumors or going nuts. And if you're a spellcaster, your ability to toss Fireballs around comes with the caveat that you could get dragged to hell for a bad roll, or lose a limb, or turn pink, you get the idea. Thing is, some of these effects can make some characters much, much weaker than others. A character close to becoming completely insane could be so far gone that she just won't be as functional as her saner companions. Which can be frustrating for the player who has to play a less competent protagonist. And I don't think that trying to even out negative trait gains really works. It creates too many contrivances (no, Sarah can't drink the glowing potion, it's Debbie's turn, sorry- doesn't really sound too engaging). So how do you deal with that? Thanks in advance y'all!</TEXT>

    <DATE>2017-11-19 21:06:08</DATE>
    <TEXT>Hello again, r/rpg. So, personally, I really like superhero roleplaying games. They often feature *great*, imagination-sparking systems, with a variety of powers for you to play with, and often with few restrictions on how, exactly, to use them. But those are just the systems. Story-wise, I must admit, I have *no idea* what kind of story would be told with those systems. What kind of world would be created? Would a Caped Crusaders game seem too silly? I think my favorite idea for a Superhero game is something like the X-Men, in which tons of people can suddenly do crazy things, and the players experience changes the world is going through because of that. But that sounds like a serious GMing challenge (just thinking about how, say, the field of medicine would change when people who can grow organs with no ethical problems popped up, sounds maddening, in a good way). So that's the question- what have you played or GM'd that made for a compelling story, that engaged players/made you engaged? What was the setting like? What made the characters interesting, and stopped them form falling into tired old cliches? Edit: I goofed up and misspelled this post's title. Great.</TEXT>

So, since I'm already running a Fudge WFRP game, I was wondering how you would handle a risky spellcasting system with Fate.

Okay, that's easy enough. What isn't too easy is figuring out what kind of effects they would cause when they backfire, and how to price them in light of their potentially negative side-effects (which would almost certainly be worse than most compels).

    <TEXT>Hi, guys. So, I just got my hands on DMC4 SE. I played the game to death a few years ago, and thought I'd take a look at the new characters. Let me tell you, I was not disappointed. The highlight for me is Lady and Trish's campaign. I started in Legendary Dark Knight, because let's face it, that's the best difficulty in the game, and was blown away (ha) by how all-out they went with Lady's gameplay. Having said that, I heard some mixed things about Trish's gameplay. Something about her being very derivative. I don't get it. If anything, I may like her even more than I do Lady. Her attacks are so satisfying, and the Sparda mechanics are definitely interesting. That said, I was sorely disappointed when I tried her guns. I imagined that they could be charged with lightning, but, nope. No such luck. If you really slam the button you can get a great rate of fire (almost comparable to Dante's Honeycomb, as far as I can tell), but no charged shot? So anyway, when I got to Echidna, she obviously got into her second phase, when she flies around. I was already in Devil Triggers, so instead of turning it off, I started firing at her. Holy hell. I did assume that Trish's DT shots would be stronger, but Dante's DT shots are only as strong as Ebony and Ivory's Charged Shots, which don't do all that much, so I assumed that it would be the same for Trish. Nope. I was shocked at how quickly DT shots depleted a boss' health bar. So awesome. And that made me wonder- how does Trish's DT work, exactly? Are there any other neat tricks I should know about? How does it interact with Pandora? Thanks!</TEXT>

    <TITLE>Reroll mechanics in concealed rolls?</TITLE>
    <DATE>2018-01-07 17:12:39</DATE>
    <TEXT>Hello, everybody~ So, some of you have probably played some games, that allow for a certain number of rerolls per game session. Dark Heresy, WFRP, Zweihander- they all give you some finite pool of points that you can use to gain rerolls. Except, sometimes, as a GM, you will want to hide some rolls from your players. How would you reasonably give them the option to make an educated decision about whether or not to spend their rerolls in these cases? Say a player failed a perception roll to notice an assasin hiding under her bed. What would you do then? One option I think could work would be to simply say, "you just failed a perception roll. Would you like to reroll?" The issue is that players usually make the decisions on whether or not to spend their rerolls based on the presumed severity of the situation. So they won't spend them when chasing a chicken down the street (...usually, depends on the chicken and the character), but they probably will if that's all that's standing between them and a terrible death. So situation in which they're not sure if it's a chicken or a stab to the kidney are problematic in this regard. I'd love to hear suggestions for people who have run into this issue. Thanks!</TEXT>

Is the system actually as rules-light as I think it is, or does it get bogged down with extra "optional" rules in the actual book? 2. Is it mostly good for short-term campaigns or is it also fine for longer stuff? 3. Does the system function equally well throughout the presumed progression system or does it break down at some point (*ahem* HERO system)? Thanks!</TEXT>

    <DATE>2018-01-29 15:00:47</DATE>
    <TEXT>Basically, what the title says. I recently got back into Hearthstone, decided to try and play it a bit more seriously and pay a bit to get a good foundation for a deck (because I had 0 fun playing with mostly Basic cards when I started a couple of years ago). It didn't really help. Whenever I play Ranked, even at rank 19, I keep running into people with structured decks stuffed full of Legendaries. If anything, I feel like a moron for having paid anything, because it seems like a put-tons-of-money-or-nothing kind of situation with this game, in which you can't really compete unless you buy enough cards to actually make a good deck. I really wish there was a budget mode in which you would be pitted against people who paid similar amounts to what you did. Running into decks that clearly have a lot of money behind them at low ranks feels horrible, and I'm not sure I can actually get much out of this game with my bank account the way it is. To clarify, it's not that I'm expecting to get to Legendary on a budget. That's clearly not going to happen, and that's fine. I'm really just looking for a middle ground here. Any suggestions for how to have fun playing ranked without feeling like I'm banging my head against a brick wall? Thanks! Edit: Thanks for the suggestions, guys! I'll try finding budget deck ideas, and try to suck less at Arena. It's nice to know that other people have been in this spot too.</TEXT>

    <TITLE>Warrior draw mechanics with board presence?</TITLE>
    <DATE>2018-01-29 16:52:56</DATE>
    <TEXT>Hi again, guys. So, I went over a few cheap Warrior deck builds, and ran into one that includes a lot of draw mechanics. You've all probably seen it before- Acolytes of Pain, Battle Rage, Slam. Which sounds good on paper (to me, a complete noob), but in practice it seems to me to translate into a lot of 2+ mana cards that do very little to give you board control. So you'll spend 3 mana on an Acolyte of Pain on turn 3, probably get one or two cards out of it in later turns, but in exchange all you're getting is a minion that probably won't help you clear the board, won't win trades, etc. Same story with Slam- the card's draw mechanic essentially relies on you *not* killing a minion, meaning you'll need to use other cards to get rid of the one you damaged. And Battle Rage, I'll admit, I have no idea how to use. I'm guessing it can take an existing board advantage and take it up to 11 by being used right after Whirlwind or something in the presence of minions with upwards of 2 health, but that seems pretty situational. This is all contrasted by the Warlock's fantastic draw options. Kobold Librarian makes me drool, and the Hero Power goes without saying. So, how do you use these draw mechanics without spending a turn doing nothing else? Or am I exaggerating a small issue, and should be happy with getting more cards (which I mean, if it wasn't a big deal I wouldn't have been obsessing over draw mechanics like this)? Are there other general or Warrior-specific draw cards that you think I should check out? Thanks!</TEXT>

I'm mostly asking about whether or not it stops being good because, well, I've read Whedon's Astonishing X-Men, and was really warded out by the drop in quality before I figured out that they mixed up the creative staff, and would have probably been happier had I stopped reading at volume 4. Thanks, everybody who answers!</TEXT>

    <TITLE>So Soi Fon would wreck Askin</TITLE>
    <DATE>2018-04-14 21:39:22</DATE>
    <TEXT>I'm sure somebody else already thought about this, but this could be the reason she was excluded from that battle. Her disappearance from the Gerard/Lille battles seems to me, like it was supposed to hint that she went off to find Yoruichi. As she would. But if that's the case, Kubo would have written himself into a corner. For Deathdealing to work, Askin needs to be exposed to a lot of reiatsu. And, yeah, captains probably give off a lot of the stuff anyway just by being around, but I highly doubt a relatively lowkey Shikai like Suzumebachi would allow him to build an immunity anywhere near as fast as a complete Shunko. My point being- one hit from Suzumebachi shouldn't be enough for Askin to become immune (if you want proof- Askin was exposed to Benihime and was still cut by it afterwards). And the moment the second hit connects (and all evidence seems to suggest that Askin is nowhere near as fast as Yoruichi or Soi Fon, at least not while they're at full power and uninjured) it's all over for him.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>So I got this card a while ago and haven't done anything with it yet because I'm worried it might be secretly good. But if it is, it sure fooled me. A 4 mana, it only gives 5/3, and its revival effect seems meh at best in light of the huge commitment it requires.

    <TITLE>The new game feels like it's trying to hide the worst part of Kratos' past</TITLE>
    <DATE>2018-05-06 22:18:39</DATE>
    <TEXT>So I love the new Kratos. He's a fantastic, three-dimensional character that I can really get behind (pun intended). That said, I'm still not sure he deserves forgiveness. Not because he murdered Zeus. If that was all there was to it, it would've been relatively fine because Zeus himself was a murderous asshole. No, the unforgivable part of Kratos' actions is that he killed Zeus, and all the god before him, while knowing full well that he would doom the rest of his world in doing so. He murdered an entire world and was completely well aware that that is what he was doing. Even before that, as a God of War, he did pretty much exactly what Ares did before him: chose sides and led an army in a gigantic murder spree. Zeus' patricide seems pretty insignificant in light of those things, so it's weird to me that that's what the game focuses on. And I am worried that they may choose to completely ignore that part of the original series. That said, I have a lot of faith in this new series, so I'm optimistic that they may explore Kratos' feelings about his backstory some more. I mean, he killed many, *many* children, albeit indirectly.. He probably feels something about that now that he has a kid of his own.</TEXT>

    <TITLE>Rebellion Feels Weird in DMC4</TITLE>
    <DATE>2018-06-25 16:30:10</DATE>
    <TEXT>So having just replayed DMC4 for the millionth time, after having finished DMC3 for the millionth time, I'm convinced that Rebellion got a significant downgrade. It feels less weighty somehow. I don't really mind the tweaking that was done to the moveset (although I liked impaling things with it way more than I do Round Trip, but okay, no biggie), but it feels less weighty even in comparison with Red Queen, which should be a relatively similar weapon (when you remove the charge features). I was thinking it might be the camera, that maybe because it's a bit further now, the moves don't feel as good to perform, but then with Vergil, the returning Yamato feels as good, if not better (even if we're only talking about the three or so moves that were relatively unchanged from DMC3), and the camera is the same. Maybe I'm just being a DMC3 fanboy, because in that game Rebellion was the bomb. It felt so versatile, every hit felt significant, and I don't think I ever tried a mission without it. Does anybody else feel this way? If so, can somebody better explain why that is?</TEXT>

    <TITLE>A few questions regarding Simple D6</TITLE>
    <DATE>2018-07-02 20:43:12</DATE>
    <TEXT>Hi, guys. So, recently I remembered this game, and decided to try playing around with it a little bit. That said, it's a very niche game (so niche, in fact, it doesn't have a subreddit), so I was wondering if anybody here might have had some experience running it. My players and I don't like crunch at all, so that's why it's interesting to me, but is it any fun to play? And in case anybody has played it, I have a few modifications in mind and was wondering if anyone would be able to offer some input in regards to them: 1. Ditch Aspects as Defenses and keep Hit Points. Defenses basically give you an automatic, extra 6, They also can't be included in Qualities, which sucks (what if my Quality is Tough or something?). So I think I'd rather take the slight slowdown and make defenses rolled, just like any other trait, and have them compete with active traits. 2. Wound tracks anybody? I'm talking about a system that uses something other than hit points, such as the one found in Fudge, Fate, and Storyteller System. Does anybody have any ideas for implementing this kind of wound system? Thanks!</TEXT>

    <TITLE>Playing against Streamers looks incredibly annoying</TITLE>
    <DATE>2018-07-08 19:09:10</DATE>
    <TEXT>So basically what the title says. Seriously, I *love* watching Streamers play, but holy hell do they waste their opponents' time doing nothing. Often, you see them on turn 1, spending their mana, or not, if they don't have anything to play, and then they still won't end their turn. Which is fine if you're thinking about your next move or trying to predict what your opponent will do, or even if you're narrating those things, but a lot of the time they focus on Streaming stuff, like Twitch bits, comments, etc. And I get it. It's how they make their living. But it must be so incredibly annoying to play against, because your opponent wastes your time doing something that has nothing to do with the game. And it's only acceptable because you don't know what they're doing. Imagine if during a Fireside somebody pulled out a camera and decided to waste your time not ending turns when possible to read unrelated stuff out loud or talk on their phone. It would be infuriating. I don't have a useful advice her or anything, just wanted to hear people's opinions on this.</TEXT>

    <DATE>2018-07-11 19:49:26</DATE>
    <TEXT>Hi, guys. So I'm going to Norway with my girlfriend this August for a couple of weeks. We'll be starting in Oslo, spend a couple of days there, then pick up a rental and travel around some more (we'll be spending 1-2 days at various smaller towns), end up in Bergen towards the end of the trip, then drive back to Oslo for the return flight. So as the title suggests, I'd like to know how much money we should expect to spend on groceries for 13 days. From what I could gather, meat is pretty expensive in Norway, so for the duration of the trip we'll be avoiding buying any (luckily she's a vegetarian). With that in mind, how much money do you think we should expect to spend on groceries? For what it's worth, we'll be trying to shop at cheaper places (I understand Kiwi is supposed to be pretty cheap, so places like that), and to only make one or two large purchases per week to avoid going back to supermarkets to spend more money. Thanks in advance, everybody!</TEXT>

    <TITLE>Making Passive traits interesting?</TITLE>
    <DATE>2018-07-21 20:16:25</DATE>
    <TEXT>So Passive traits are fairly common across most games, right? Whether it's Investigation, Awareness, Stamina, etc. Most of them can be pretty awesome. A VTM character with inhuman stamina (or even the relevant Discipline) can jump off a building and expect to be perfectly fine, a very perceptive character can expect to notice fine details and/or to always tell when someone's lying, etc. Here's my problem with those traits: they're often not as engaging for players. Again with perception, characters can usually say "I look for X, do I see anything?" and that's about it. There aren't many interesting ways to roleplay these traits. Some exceptions exist- Exalted has many Charms that require activation and provide interesting input, while still requiring conscious player choice. But most of the time, these traits are just sort of... there, in the form of flat bonuses. So, how do you make these traits interesting and, most importantly, engaging, in your games? To clarify, while I did just praise Exalted for featuring exactly that, I'm not interested in extra crunch- I'm almost exclusively a rules-light DM, so I'd rather avoid adding stuff on top of these traits.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>So a lot of us probably share the opinion that healing in RPGs is pretty boring. It's not very hard to see why- it's not terribly engaging to say "I use -insert spell name here- to heal them". So I was wondering if there are any games out there that make healing more involved, or that at least have cool mechanics for healing. What instantly popped into my mind (while not from an rpg) was Crazy Diamond from JJBA. It's really cool because while a staple feature it has is that it can heal very well, it does so in a way that allows for plenty of creativity, and it's also widely applicable outisde of healing. So anyway, if anybody could point me towards a system/setting that handles healing in a cool way, that would be greatly appreciated.</TEXT>

Sure, we can appreciate flavorful or clever mechanics, but a lot of the time it gets in the way for us rather than being conductive to roleplaying. So naturally, we've been stepping down the crunch ladder, but the lightest system we've tried is Fudge. That game has enjoyed some success, but I was wondering if anybody has any experience running stuff that's even lighter, such as single-page systems. Do they become unusable over longer games? Are they too abstract to keep players engaged? Etc. Really, I just want to hear about people's experiences with those systems in general. Thanks in advance!</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Title. I really liked Nero in DMC4, but having exactly one set of weapons kind of made him stale after a while (...or 5 playthroughs). Sure, in DMC5 it looks like he'll have a bunch of Devil Breakers, but if while using those you'll always be stuck using Red Queen, I'm not sure that they'll be enough to spice Nero up. If nothing else, I think that this game will be a good opportunity to let him wield Yamato. Sure, it will have to wait until the end of the game where he presumably retrieves his Devil Bringer, which also presumably still has Yamato in it, but it would still be cool. Do you agree, or is it just me and everybody else are fine with Nero being the beginner-friendly option to balance Dante's insanity?

    <DATE>2018-10-15 18:20:26</DATE>
    <TEXT>My girlfried and I have been using an IUD for the last two and a half years. Before that, we used condoms. Anyway, IUDs sometimes cause some troubles that mean you need to take them out. So that happened, and she's getting it out next week. But she can't use the pill either, since she was told (by a doctor) that she may not be compatible with them, and that she would need to do some tests to make sure. Honestly, personally, and she knows this, I wouldn't want her to use the pill anyway, the side effects sound both horrible and common. She wanted to start taking them and do those tests after that, but we agreed that it would be a bad idea. The best-case scenario that I can think of is that her doctor will say it's okay to get another IUD a few months down the line, assuming the issue goes away. So for now, we'll be using condoms again. I would never ever tell her this but I'm a little bit worried. I remember how it used to be with them, how it would occasionally feel not great, how I could lose erections, how it would be frustrating to put one on the wrong way and have to get another one, and all that jazz. So has anybody else been in this situation? Because I want to know what to expect, and what we can do to make the transition go smoother. I am aware of the importance of picking the right kind and the right size, and also of the drop of lube on the inside tip. Other than that, nothing. Thanks in advance!</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Title. I really really like VTM. The setting, the clans, the Disciplines, all that good stuff. But of boy the system wasn't great. It also wasn't Exalted-level broken, but it was still slow, fairly unbalanced, etc. Chronicles of Darkness, on the other hand, fixed a lot of the stuff I had issues with in VTM, and also made the game run much smoother and faster. So what I wanna know is how much of that carried over to VTM 5e. Is the game as fast and easy to run? Is it more balanced than previous editions? Do you have flat trait costs? Did they keep the beats system? Did the fewer dice rolls philosophy survive? Feel free to toss in other important details I didn't mention here, ofc! Oh, on a side note- Chronicles of Darkness requires Requiem to play a Vampire game, right? Does VTM 5e also require a companion book? If not, how is the basic mechanics chapter? Thanks!

    <TEXT>I'm sure he must be an at least mildly popular character, but yeah, title. He just seems to completely ruin the tone and themes of the show. Whereas other characters suffer consequences for their mistakes, Todd doesn't. Stuff just happens to him and he rolls with it. He makes a ton of shitty businesses, and a lot of money gets spent on them, and yet he somehow either profits or suffers no financial damage. He is never held liable for any of the shit he does (such as, y'know, kidnapping children, or endangering people by indirectly infecting them with... I think it was rabies?). The scene where he got that managment job in season 4 seemed like a joke in the wrong way, in that it looked like a dumb, fanficky wish fulfillment scene somebody wrote after botching a job interview- he literally just walks into an interview to become a freaking janitor and ends up in a suit five minutes later. Oh, and of course the business-approving lady he should by all rights have made a terrible impression on falls for him, and also happens to be asexual. Sure. And he's jus so. Freaking. Stale. Other characters change. Their personal lives shift. They care about these changes. Not Todd. He just doesn't give a damn. And it doesn't matter if his rolling with things is a character trait because it's still so incredibly boring to watch. Every time he's on screen, in my head it's like "oh, shit, this guy again, another scene in which fortune rains down on him, and even if it doesn't, nobody cares, nobody will remember his screw-ups, and this is essentially filler". Every other characer I can expect to develop in some way, or to have interesting reactions to the stuff that happens, or to bounce off of the other characters in interesting ways. Not Todd. Ok, rant out. Just had to get it out of my system.</TEXT>

    <TITLE>Why didn't Aang try taking away Ozai's bending right off the bat?</TITLE>
    <DATE>2018-12-02 12:52:33</DATE>
    <TEXT>I'm really not a fan of the way that confrontation ended. I think (probably like a lot of people) that it chickened out of a bold conclusion for a show with a younger target audience. Worse yet- dealing with Ozai was presented as something of a real world problem, in that he was a leader who, if left alive, would continue to be the figurehead of a dangerous faction, even while imprisoned. Energybending spits in the face of that by applying a completely impossible solution to that very real problem. And then there's the question of timing. Throughout the battle, Aang never tries to take Ozai's bending away. Which makes the end of the battle even more confusing and retroactively strips it of its moral tension. Because Aang knew he could try energybending out on Ozai since before the battle began, he didn't even really need to consider killing him. Yeah, Aang very nearly... lost, I guess? The clash of will or whatever it was against Ozai, but it doesn't matter because knowing Aang as we do at that point, if there was a chance he could've removed Ozai as a threat without killing him, that was always going to be what he would choose to do, even if it would've put him at greater risk. And doing that (showing us that this option was available to Aang from before the battle began) is the narrative equivalent of two characters having an intense hand to hand battle at the climactic end of a movie, only for one of them to suddenly take out a hand cannon and blast the other person's face off. People who liked this ending- am I missing something? Was there some reason Aang even had an in-character reason to consider killing Ozai, when he knew how to take away bending in the first place?</TEXT>

    <TEXT>So this game looks really cool. The mechanics seem pretty solid, and while I'm really not a fan of RNG, as a former Hearthstone player it seems less bad here. I don't even really mind the monetization that much- I spent around 100$ on HS, but most of the cards I got were warrior. I wanted to try building something competitive with that, which went... poorly, to say the least. So when I hear people say you can actually make a decent deck for 30$-ish, that gets me stoked. But I hear the player count has dropped significantly since launch, and I don't want to invest in a game that may not be in fighting shape six months from now. Are my worries valid, or is this just a bump that the game will recover from? I tried looking around to see if Valve had responded to complaints yet, or if any updates were planned, but couldn't really find anything, which is also quite worrying. So any input would be appreciated. Thanks!</TEXT>

    <TITLE>The (current) Uncanny X-Men choice of cast really isn't for me</TITLE>
    <DATE>2018-12-27 16:22:38</DATE>
    <TEXT>So this is probably super subjective, but personally, my favorite X-Men stories features five to eight protagonists, tops. New X-Men, the classic Claremont run, the recent X-Men Red, they all have casts that are large enough for different characters to bounce off one another, while not being so large that no character gets any focus. In fact, for large portions of the story, the cast is often dwindled down to even smaller groups. Compare that with the mess that is Uncanny X-Men. I have no idea what they were thinking. So many characters. I'm sure that part of the idea is that everyone's favorites will get at least some panel time, but then what kind of panel time is that when they're up for maybe five pages before the story has to move on to other characters? And even when somebody gets some development, we can never see the nuances of that, because the story certainly has no time to focus on anything other than what is happening right then and there. And then, when they start with a cast that big, it doesn't seem likely that they'll dwindle it down in the future, so that also sucks. Am I alone in not liking huge casts? I know a lot of people really liked Messiah Complex, which also had a similarly huge cast, so if there's some appeal here that's lost on me, I'd love to hear about it.</TEXT>

    <DATE>2018-12-30 07:23:40</DATE>
    <TEXT>Minor rant incoming. So either that same episode or the one before, there was this scene in which Lester sneaks out of the hospital. That was a pretty big stretch already. He goes out for hours, nobody checks in on him, even while the hospital staff is looking for Mr. Kreech, and he takes off his disguise while driving, and yet nobody noticed him, or that Mr. Kreech's car was suspiciously going around town when the owner was in the hospital. In a small town where everybody knows everybody. But that wasn't where the show broke my suspension of disbelief. That happened later, when Malvo walks into a building filled with armed people, and kills them all, rambo style, without getting hit once himself, only to later waltz out of the building that had tons of police officers outside, in broad daylight, ofc completely undisguised. Yeah, that's when I stopped caring for Malvo, because the fun of these shows comes from thinking about how the guy could get caught, and yet at that point it became clear that he could basically do whatever the plot needed him to. I'm halfway through season 2 and so far, it has managed to avoid that same mistake, in that no one character seems as unkillable. Feel free to complain about your favorite "wtf show" moment.</TEXT>

    <TITLE>Good Beast stories? Also rant</TITLE>
    <DATE>2019-03-24 19:57:56</DATE>
    <TEXT>So, I'm a big X-Men fan, but my absolute favorite is Beast (well, him and Emma, but more on that in a bit). And boy does that suck nowadays. Idk what's going on these days, but it seems every. Single. Time. Beast is on-panel, the writers take a big dump on him. Not only does he usually suffer the worst consequences of most crossovers, but he is also made to act completely out of character in those stories. AvX? He sided with the Avengers. IvX? He sided with the Inhumans. Him and Abigail? Not a word on that since 2004. Did they just forget each other or what? Even outside of crossovers, he's still every writer's favorite punching bag (such as when he brought the teen X-Men into the present, got effectively kicked out of the mansion for it, and also the watcher glared at him, even though he never did that in any other one of the million times X-Men time traveled). It's just, the way he's been treated in the comics this past decade, as less a lovable, gentle giant, and more as an irresponsible mad scientist, it breaks my heart. Because I remember why I love him as a character when I go back and read Grant Morrison, Joss Whedon and Claremont's runs. He had his shit together, as much as he could. I really wish he got a happy ending. And it's comics, that's never gonna happen, I know. But, well, when I look at, say, Scott and Emma post IvX, that's still a happy ending to me. Because those two were still together, doing their thing for a long while. Beast never really got that. That's the reason I don't feel like I'm in as much of a need of Emma comics. She had several happy endings. She's virtually always in-character. She is written consisently. I don't need her to catch a break, but Beast hasn't had one in so long. So, are there any comics I've been missing in which Beast is still written well and not as a punching bag, in which he still has a big role? Thanks in advance!</TEXT>

    <TITLE>How do you deal with families with/as a player?</TITLE>
    <DATE>2019-03-24 22:07:50</DATE>
    <TEXT>So my GM wants to start a Godbound campaign. We were talking about this character idea that I had, and he asked the perfectly normal "does he have a family?" question. And that got me thinking that, yeah, that would make sense for that character, given his age. And I also very much want to avoid a "lone wolf" cliche, and even moreso an edgy "they're dead" schtick. But I have no idea how they could possibly fit into the campaign. I'm also not sure if my GM would feel comfortable roleplaying, say, children, in that capacity. There's also the matter that Godbound probably just don't relate too well to their mortal relatives. So, people who played, or would play, characters with families, how did/would you do it? GMs who handled similar situations, I'd love to hear from you as well. Thanks!</TEXT>

    <DATE>2019-03-30 13:54:08</DATE>
    <TEXT>As the title says, I'm having a hard time picking beteen these two builds. I just finished the forest after doing Cainhurst Castle, so I now have the Chikage and Evelyn. I'm about lvl 65, so up till now I could do well just by pumping stats like Vit or End, and a bit of Str, Skl and Bt to meet weapon requiremets. But now I kind of need to decide where to put my stats from now on. I've heard that BT builds are good, but what turns me off from them atm is the slim weapon selection. From what I understand you've got the Chikage, the Bloodletter, and Simon's Bowblade. That's just three weapons. I'm not sure that that's enough variety to keep me invested. Oh, I also need to decide so that I can wisely spend the blood chunks I got from the castle, which will go into the Chikage if I use it, or my trusty Ludwig's Holy Blade otherwise. So- bloodtinge- yay or nay? Thanks y'all</TEXT>

    <TITLE>Just beat the Defiled Chalice! A few Inisights to save you some frustration</TITLE>
    <DATE>2019-04-23 22:01:43</DATE>
    <TEXT>Hoo boy, what a wild ride that was. I'm now doing Isz and so far it is absolutely breezy in comparison. I'm doing an Arc build, using the HMS. I also have 50 vit, and both the HP runes you can find outside the dungeons. All of that only meant that in the defiled dungeon, my HP was about on par with that of a starting character. As a side note, I just don't understand all the intricate echo farming methods that use main game stuff. Just go to the late game dungeons. Basic enemies drop 3000+ echoes. From my experience I can say that if you go to the defiled dungeon with late game stuff (a +10 weapon is pretty important) you will probably only have a hard time with the last two bosses. Even then, the only stuff that are still likely to kill you even if you're careful are their respective one shots (the charge for the pupper, and the leap attack for Amy). Both of those are heavily telegraphed, but they also have very large hitboxes, so getting killed by them is pretty inevitable. Watchdog is mostly about learning its attacks and punishing its bites. I know some people only punish the sweeping side bites, but I found that punshing the uppercut, lunge and repeated bites also works, even with a slower weapon like the HMS. Quicker weapons can probably do it even easier (and the Beasthunter Saif's r1 is probably fantastic for that). Also punish the lava vomit attack by running to its legs and getting in a good few hits. If it does its paw swipe, you will need to look out for the flame trail of that attack. You can aboid it by quickstepping to the oppsite side of the one the sweep was coming from. Amy was the boss that demanded me to change how I tackled her the most. For one thing, when I ran into her in Nightmare Frontier she was so easy she didn't even require a strategy. When I started off the defiled version though, and after dying a few times and realizing I needed a plan, I ran to her ankles (getting hit and dying in the attempt multiple times) to try and bait her easily dodgable stomp. Don't do that. It is much, much harder to dodge her mixup attacks when you can neither see her whole body nor get back in time. What you should do is an altered version of Beyonce- strafe to the left (without quickstepping to reserve stamina) while keeping your distance (do not stick to her rear like you would with other bosses), and dodge to the left and back with quicksteps when she attacks. Then, once she's done attacking, go in, land a hit or two (again it depends on your weapon), pull back, rinse and repeat. Whenever her head is down at the end of an attack, hit it. This exact strategy works even when she goes into her final phase. Oh, and Executioner's Gauntlets works like a charm on Amy. She's so huge all three projectiles will almost certainly hit. I used all my QS bullets to finish off her last bit of health from afar, since as we've established she can barely hit you if you're not close enough (she has some beam attacks, but those are easy to see coming and dodge). I'm still of the opinion the chalice dungeons suck, but man the rush I got when those two bosses went down was only matched by the one I got out of killing the Orphan of Kos.</TEXT>

    <TITLE>My biggest pet peeve abour DMC5- weapon pacing</TITLE>
    <DATE>2019-05-06 16:55:13</DATE>
    <TEXT>Hi, guys. So, now that the game's been out for a while, I think I may not be crucified for saying this. I love this game, and this is pretty much the one major gameplay issue I've got with it. The pace in which you unlock new weapons is pretty bad. In previous games, you usually had a couple of missions between each new addition to your arsenal (not always, but yeah). That allowed you to learn how these new weapons work. I'd argue that now that you can equip everything at once, that pacing is even more crucial. Except for Dante, it is non-existent and you are constantly bombarded with more stuff. Hell, both Cerberus and DSD are given to you for a freaking boss fight, and trying out new weapons on those is a bad time. Same issue with how you're introduced to SDT. Other than that, basically every level you play with Dante, you get a new weapon, which sounds good on paper, except that leaves you with no time to get familiar with what you already have. V basically doesn't have this problem since his arsenal is smaller, but Nero also has a version of it: you unlock Devil Breakers at a pretty good pace for the first half of the game, but for the latter half? You've already unlocked them all, so you've got nothing to look forward to until the very last mission. And I don't even understand why! Some levels, you get two now Devil Breakers, why not hand out one of those for one of the later stages? And, of course, Nero's DT is the biggest offender of this. Yes, it's cool af that it drops for the climactic final battle, but again, the game doesn't give you any time to get a grip on it. I can already see someone typing "how can you complain that Dante gets new weapons too quickly and then also complain that Nero gets them too slowly?" Well, there is a middle ground between getting new weapons every single level and only getting them for the first half of the game. I think a weapon every other mission would be a good balance. Alright, that's it, rant over. What do you guys think? Am I a dumb dipshit for not appreciating the game's generosity? Is there no such thing as too much of a good thing?</TEXT>

    <TITLE>Finally beat Lady Butterfly, most history I've ever had with a video game boss</TITLE>
    <DATE>2019-06-14 18:34:31</DATE>
    <TEXT>So my story with Lady Butterfly begins like how I imagine it does for most people playing this game. I got the bell, went through Wolf's memories thinking it was the main plot and where I was supposed to go next. Did alright, a bit sloppy cause I was new to the game, had some trouble with that fat miniboss guy, but did alright against him as well when I realized you can recruit that samurai fellow to help you out. Well, actually that's inaccurate, I only won when I also reazlied that you should only have him join the fight after killing all the regular mooks.  #8203; We all know what comes next. Lady Butterfly wiped the floor with me. I used the fucking snap seed, thinking that that super hard form must be an illusion. It was not. More face floor wiping ensued. I noped out of that boss fight when I suddenly remembered that when I found the bell there was actually more to explore at Ashina Outskirts.  #8203; I beat Gyoubu before first considering retrying Lady Butterfly, but realized that I only had one health upgrade, and my attack power was also only slightly higher, so noped then as well. I figured maybe with another health upgrade and another attack boost I would stand a chance.  #8203; I was kinda right...? After beating Genichiro (who may, in fact, have been stronger than Lady Butterfly, so maybe I fought them in the wrong order) I decided to have another go. I had a few more snap seeds, which I still wasn't sure were gonna be useful, but hey, whatever.  #8203; She still kicked my ass, except this time I got to her second phase and was mortified by how hard it was. I had like 5 snap seeds, which weren't gonna be enough for the amount of repeats I figured I would have to do. As a side note, can we all agree that it's really impressive that blind guy somehow made Lady Butterfly go into her second phase? He must have, considering that he saw her illusions, but unlike Kuro it's unlikely Butterfly used them to avoid directly hurting him (what with the missing eyes and all).  #8203; So today I tried again. First couple of tries went poorly. Then I realized that I should probably just ignore the tip the game gives you about enemies with fast posture recovery. Maybe it's because I have a lot of upgrades from the Ashina tree, Idk, but I noticed that if I just keep attacking and parrying her posture built up quickly enough. Also, that her counterattacks are actually super predicatble and pretty easy to deflect.  #8203; So somehow, without using res power at all, I got her first phase down. Then she disappeared, and while she was doing her usual speech I went like "huh, wait a minute, didn't she always appear in one exact spot in all the previous times she did this? And didn't she also have a short animation before she spawned her illusions? And I let her do that... why?" So yeah, as soon as she appeared I immediately began attacking, and so prevented her from creating illusions. I was super pumped, still had plenty of healing left. But then, when her posture was close to breaking, she pulled off her illusion move, and my heart sank. I was 100% sure at any moment now one of her mooks would attack me from behind. But I didn't let up, kept attacking, and just like that, she went down.  #8203; And boy, she had some sweet loot to boot! Not only do you get more res power, but you also get more attack power on top of that? Wow!  #8203; Anyway, that's my story. I'm not quite sure if this was a better boss than Genichiro, but it did a much better job showing how much Wolf's seemingly insiginificant improvements along the way added up, and also how the game made me get better. So far, this game has been pretty impressive.</TEXT>

    <TITLE>Just beat Owl(Father) and oh, great Cthulhu, the fucking camera</TITLE>
    <DATE>2019-06-22 18:25:38</DATE>
    <TEXT>TL;DR- what the title says.  #8203; Today on the billionth attempt, I beat Owl (Father). Boy did he not pull ay punches. I got desperate at some point and looked up cheese strats, but the only one I found was to bait one specific attack that's super telegraphed and easy to dodge. Yeah, don't do that, he hardly ever does that attack. Instead I had to learn all of his moves and find their openings. Surprisingly, 90% of them actually have those. Btw, if you absolutely \*must\* attack only on his worst attacks, add his thrust to your list. If you have Mikiri Counter (which you should) it is his easiest attack to counter.  #8203; But that fight accentuated the single big problem I have with this game, the camera. what appears to be happening is, the camera can't handle it when it's sqeezed between Wolf and something else, it can't handle it. Now, what most cameras do in these cases in most video games, is make something transparent so that they can maintain their lock on. Well, Sekiro's camera must be a perfectionist because it essentially says "I'D RATHER DIE THAN RUIN MY BEAUTIFUL PIXELS". So it does. It dies, and kills your lock on with it. Which happened basically every other match against Owl, since those fucking pillars and the walls kept killing the lock on. So that was fun.  #8203; I don't remember having this issue in any other FROMSOFT game (but I haven't played DS3). I mean, sure, sometimes you wouldn't want to lock on since you needed to see stuff that the locked camera wouldn't let you (Amygdala in BB, prowling magus in DS2), but I don't remember the camera ever unlocking itself. And I especially don't remember it being a frequent occurance.  #8203; Am I stupid or something? Am I perhaps accidentally clicking R3 while running or what?</TEXT>

    <TEXT>They just don't. I really love the adventures the crystal gems used to go on, even early on. You got to see cool places, Steven was adorable (even when he was slightly more annoying than he is today) and most imortantly, you got to see the crystal gems doing stuff. They are the main characrers. I like watching Garnet Amethyst and Pearl and Steven. I love their interactions.  #8203; But oh man, the townie episodes just stick out like a sore thumb for me. I really tried giving them a fair shot. But they bore me to tears. They expect me to get invested in characters that barely have any screen time normally, and who will become completely irrelevant to the rest of the plot once their episodes end. And I just can't do that. Also, when they're on screen, nine times out of ten you can kiss those cool visuals and magic stuff goodbye. You can maybe expect a monster or something, but those are rarely as fleshed out or as focused as the gem episodes because the show needs to spend a lot of time to try and get you to care about those side characters. And it just doesn't work. And I'm not even in parts that have actual ongoing arcs yet, such as the cluster arc, in which following townies around while something much bigger is going on feels insane.</TEXT>

    <TITLE>Just beat Demon of Hatred, pretty sure I had an advantage thanks to Bloodborne</TITLE>
    <DATE>2019-06-28 09:40:19</DATE>
    <TEXT>First off, I did have the Malcontent, so if anybody thinks that invalidates my beating him, sure.  #8203; But it really is the case that that boss is much more like a Bloodborne boss than most other bosses. Dodging and attacking when he's open is a really good way of beating him. I never once deflected any of his attacks. Now, that's not all there is to this fight. You must keep a middling distance between you and him. If you get too close, his attacks won't be easy to dodge, and he may even combo you, which means certain death, I'm pretty sure (although I only had eight prayer necklaces when I beat him, maybe with a fully upgraded health bar you could barely survive a combo).  #8203; I just got into this game after finishing Bloodborne a couple of months ago. And as you could expect, this generally put me at a disadvantage, since you cannot take on most bosses like you would a BB boss (well, sometimes you can, the bull minibosses are a good example, as is the Chained Ogre and the first phase of the Guardian Ape, but try pulling that shit against, say, O'rin, and she will wipe the floor with you). But once I saw that Demon of Hatred dealt fire damage, it became pretty clear that parrying is probably not a huge part of this fight. But all of his attacks have gigantic attack windows. If you can learn the correct distance you should put between him and you, very few of his attacks should catch you off guard.  #8203; Well, on paper, anyway. I beat him with only one use of my Healing Gourd remaining...  #8203; And about the Malcontent, it allows you destroy something like two thirds of his health. Use it.  #8203; Hope this helps someone...</TEXT>

    <TITLE>Why I stopped reading The Girl who Played With Fire by Stieg Larson</TITLE>
    <DATE>2019-09-09 20:28:31</DATE>
    <TEXT>Apologies if this is the wrong subreddit for this rant, but Idk where else to post this. I am certainly not posting this on the Millennium series subreddit which I can only assume exists. Also, please excuse me if I misspell character names or misquote parts of the book. I did not read it in its source language, nor in English for that matter. A few years ago, when I read The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo, I was kinda torn up about it. On the one hand, I really liked the witty, sarcastic writing style. It was really funny for a thriller (also, considering some of the subjects the book tried to tackle) and made for a very smooth read. But on the other hand, once I had finished the book I realized that there was very very little plot. The book certainly didn't have a reason to be as long as it was, considering the characters don't really evolve much over the course of the story. But that wasn't what bothered me most about that book, no siree. That would be the main character, Michael, the wierd wish fulfillment role he seems to play for the author, and his attitude towards women. You see, Michael is a stud. He has lot of sex. But he doesn't go out looking for sex. Oh no. Sex just kinda happens to him. He doesn't mean to be a flirt or to play with people's emotions, either. He just accidentally stumbles unto various women's beds, and apparently cannot help that he breaks a few hearts along the way. And many of his lovers don't really amount to a lot other than crude sex objects. Erica contributes to the first book's plot maybe once or twice, distantly and vaguely and without having much if any agency in the plot, for example. And this whole thing really bothered me for the entirely of the first book. It could be an interesting character flaw, except the first book isn't very critical of Michael at all. And then the movie came out and suddenly lots of people were reading the second book as well. A couple of years later, I noticed it on my parents' bookshelf and was like "oh, yeah, that". I had just run out of Neil Gaiman to read and was desparate for something similar, and in my desparation sarcastic writing equated to other sararcastic writing. I was a bit worried about that whole accidental sex/ whoopsie misogyny that the book had going on too. But then, in the first few dozen of pages, the book kinda seemed to lampshade Michael's behavior, by having him not realize exactly what he did to piss off Lisabeth, and also have him feel regret over it. And I was thinking, maybe if the book actually stays critical of Michael's behavior, he will grow into something other than the author's vaguely uncomfortable self insert. Okay, yeah, Michael was also rich now and the relatively small newspapaer he was working for was suddenly super popular due to one story, which would also presumably make the guy rich, which is even more wish fulfillment-y, but hey, maybe this will go somewhere. And you know what, maybe it did, I wouldn't know. Since a bit past page 100, Michael has this conversation with a woman called Harriet that goes like this: Harriet: "would you like to seduce me?" Michael: "Yes." And then they have sex. You could not get more absurd than that if you tried. And of course, right at the beginning of that section, the book goes out of its way to tell you that Michael did not plan on becoming Harriet's lover. Because of course he didn't. So no thank you, mr. book sir, I'm done. I guess I'm mostly looking to vent here, but if somebody could convince me I'm wrong and that the book is not as sexist as I think it is, that would be great.</TEXT>

    <TITLE>I'm sick of being scared all the time</TITLE>
    <DATE>2019-09-15 18:52:11</DATE>
    <TEXT>I've had what I'm assuming is pretty mild anxiety for most of my life now. No idea when it started. High school, maybe? Anyway, it's really not that bad. When I read what anxiety does to other people I get the feeling I really shouldn't be complaining. I can function just fine, it doesn't disturbt my work at all, and anyway I have a great support network for dealing with life in general. But man, getting stuck in my own head blows. The dumbest, most insignificant thing can happen and I can end up internally screaming for days. For example, I recently moved to a new place. The new place's laundry machine was leaking. And, y'know, I told myself that it wasn't a big deal, I could afford a new one (if not painlessly), and worst-case scenario my gf and I could wash our clothes at either her or my parents' houses. But I freaked out. No joke, my brain somehow made a glitchy laundry machine into an "omg we're 100% going to die" situation. And ofc it was fixable and now the machine works fine, but I instead worry that it'll go bad again. Because of course I do. Or, say, the refrigerator. It cools things a bit too much and they end up mildly frozen. Again, not a big deal, I think I can turn up the temperature in it a little bit and it'll be just fine. Even if it can't do that (it's an old apartment with old things), I can just microwave stuff. But again. Brain insists that this will be the end of me. And the connection between these things is the way my anxiety makes me fear my gf's responses. She's abroad for a semester, but she's coming back next month. I'm super stoked about that. But I also worry that she'll hate the new place, possibly for these tiny flaws that honestly most apartments have anyway, especially when they're for renting. And she's not like that. She can deal with these things without complaining, or she'll just help me solve these issues. We have a really strong relationship. I know that. But again, I'm just so irrationally scared of the dumbest shit. Honestly the only relief I get from my own dumb thoughts is at my job, of all things. Well, that and video games, and cuddles. I would like to give therapy a go. Again, I know I have anxiety and that therapy would probably help with that. Thing is, I can't really afford it over a long(ish) period of time. There aren't really that many affordable mental health options where I live either (not the US), except for students who suffer specifically from depression (and I just finished my degree last March and never had depression). So I guess what I'm after (on top of venting) is, people who manage their anxiety- how do you do it? Again, I feel stupid for asking because if I funcion just fine it might read like I'm complaining over a whole bunch of nothing, but it's kinda hard to explain how just having these thoughts, even without making bad decisions based on them, is exhausting.</TEXT>

So really only Fran, who is an Archer/Monk, and Balthier, who is an Uhlan/Machinist, could touch him without Quickenings. Belias did jack shit too, he died in like 2 seconds and his big flashy attack didn't do anything.  #8203; So, I did what any reasonable player would do. Ignored the fact that goaty boy was obviously meant to be tackled later and grind for a couple of hours. By the time I came back my characters were all level 30 and had most of one or both their licence boards unlocked. All of my characters got level 2 quickenings and Vaan even has his last one (because for knight and time battlemage they don't really unlock anything important even if you wait). Fran and Baltheir now hit like trucks due to the amount of battle lores they got (yet inexplicably less so than Ashe, who is a red mage/black mage, and doesn't have anywhere near as many battle lores- this might have something to do with the fact she has a more advanced weapon but that's still kinda janky).  #8203; It still took me three tries, but I got him.  #8203; And then I went on with the story, really enjoyed that scene between Ashe and Vaan (pretty glad they cleared up the reason he was tagging along in the first place)... and then Larsa came along. Mother. Fucking. Larsa. Who was also quite leveled. Who still had infinite Hi-potions. Who, if he was with me, could have made my grinding quicker, and probably saved me like five levels of it.  #8203; Thanks for that, game. Really appreciate the help.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Hugely dependent on the cat. I had one cat who was a obsessed with attention and would sprint to jump onto my lap the moment he would catch me sitting down. So he liked pets and cuddles, and would reward me with licks and purrs. I also had another cat who would slap me around for even thinking about hugging her. So I showed her affection by leaving her the fuck alone and by not making any sudden movents on the rare occasions where she would rub against me. She showed me affection by letting me pet her if I asked nicely and didn't annoy her that week. Oh, and she also gave me a dead mouse once, so there's that.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Some men's precum can contain a small amount of semen which, though unlikely to do so, can make a woman pregnant. Precum flushes out liquids from your urethra to help semen along. It can also flush out leftover semen from the last time you had sex, and that can cause pregnancies. What usually happens when pullout fails though is that the guy thinks he pulled out before he came when in reality he didn't notice he already released his first pulse of cum.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Generally the stats afforded by clothing in this game are negligible. That's compounded by the fact you can't even upgrade them. The sole exception is specific elemental protection. The charred hunter set, for example, pretty much only protects you from fire damage, so wearing the whole set will reduce fire damage noticeably. Still, it isn't a huge deal, so I'd say yes, you definitely can wear the top hat for the whole game, including dlc and chalice dungeons.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I've heard mostly praise for central Yharnam. It is a very effective crash course in most of the game's combat mechanics. The basic Yharnamites are likely to overwhelm new players, which forces them to either employ the crowd control functions that all 3 starting weapons have, or use molotovs or pebbles to split the crowds. The larger enemies, such as the werewolves or whatever the guy with the axe is called, also teach you to parry. And ofc, if you make it to the bridge (before cleric beast) you learn about shortcuts, which save your progress even if you didn't make it to the first lantern. And even if you lose blood echoes, the enemies there drop so few echoes in the first place that you will most likely get an amount that's similar to what you lost from *either* cleric beast or Gascoigne. And all of that happens in the best area in the game for vial farming, meaning you get extra room to make mistakes.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Maybe they could work with weaker kin, but they would almost certainly see diminished gains as a result. As for finding another Great One- even if they did it wouldn't guarantee success. Ebrietas was a great catch because a. she had a reason to help out b. She was sympathetic towards the Choir. Whereas Kos, Amygdala, Moon Presence and Oedon all wouldn't give their blood, most likely (and even if, like Kos, they couldn't resist, taking their blood by force could have had disastrous consequences). Even if they did, since the Choir also had the Brain of Mensis, yet continued to use Ebrietas, that means either the Brain's blood couldn't be used in the same way, or that the Choir couldn't get it out of the nightmare of Mensis. Again meaning, even if the Choir had acquired another Great One, it may not have sufficed to replace Ebrietas. As for the knights, I think those are just pthumerians, not church knights.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I read a theory that the Moon Presence is hostile towards other Great Ones and that it created the Dream to guide hunters into killing them. That could be why Gehrman only offers you a way out once you kill the Wet Nurse (and possibly also Mergo). That goes hand in hand with its child related desires. Great Ones cannot multiply, but as we see with the childhood ending and the orphan of Kos, they can die to give birth to a new Great One (the celestial babies aren't Great Ones, they're kin). So once the Moon Presence learned that the hunter not only killed a few Great Ones, but also got "eyes on the inside", it could let them kill it to give birth to something that would be even better at killing great ones than it was. Gehrman may have fulfilled only one of these categories (after all, he only had one umbilical cord, and he never consumed even that one), so Moon Presence merely took him in as a semi child of sorts.</TEXT>

So that was fun, but then when she started to actually die years later, that was much worse. Finding out she couldn't stand anymore was terrifying. I couldn't leave her alone because if she fell, there was an increasing chance she wouldn't be able to get back up. My dad and I both remember times when we would wake up to her crying in the middle if the night because she fell in a puddle of her own pee and couldn't get up. I remember going to our yard and finding her lying on the grass, and bringing her inside cuz it was too hot to sunbathe (which she did love doing). Years later I wonder how long she'd been there, probably dehydrated. I already knew the day my parents called me to say the vet said to put her to sleep. Weirdest, most depressing, guilt-ridden relief I ever felt.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Going by regular gameplay alone it would be hard to say, but if we include cutscenes Bayo takes the cake. She has at least half the power neccesary to punch a very very large god into the sun. Dante just hasn't shown anything that absurd yet, not even in SDT. And again if we go by cutscenes rather than gameplay, Bayo can stop time for waaaay longer than Dante with QS, and his SDT just doesn't last long enough to be a major factor here (especially since, because all styles are unavailable in SDT, Dante wouldn't have access to QS in it, which woupd be very very bad against Bayo). The only thing Dante has over Bayo is his absurd regen, but that wouldn't help him too much if he was flung into space.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Where does anything say QS lasts forever? Even if it did then it would just cancel out Bayo's time stop. And considering QS even runs out in super form, I highly doubt it does last forever. In regard to rg- that's something Bayo also has with an accessory (of which she can have several at a time), except hers also triggers a lengthy time stop at no cost. Dante can teleport, but he cannot attack while teleporting. I don't see how that ability alone would constitute a win, or even contribute significantly. And about the Yamato scenario- why does Bayo's needing magic to breathe in space matter if she can do it nonstop at no cost? I mean, the skill argument just applies equally to bayo (infinite combos? Check. Guard anything? Check. Hell, she can even teleport with some moves) except Bayo hits considerably stronger than Dante). It's not even a fair comparison because Bayonetta as a series is just much less grounded and way more over the top than DMC. It's kind of like comparing DBZ to fist if the north star. Both feature supernatural martial arts, yes, but they're just not tonally that similar.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>About the teleporting, I meant that he can attack before or after teleporting, but not during the move itself. And Dante took on a demon god. Not a god in the sense of the creator of the universe, which is what bayo took down. In addition, he didn't actually kill Mundus (but he did kill Agrosax, who was relative to mundus, and pretty effortlessly at that, which is his more impressive feat imo). Well, if you haven't played bayonetta, you definitely should. It's a great game. Gameplay-wise I think only DMC5 topped it (and that's coming from someone who loves dmc3 to death).</TEXT>

You know the media circus is going to hurt your kid more than anything, but you'd rather do that than letting them be who they want to be?

    <TEXT>You're putting his argument in a bubble for some reason and I'll try to explain why that's wrong and how the guy is encouraging rape. His argument is that since women can ignore a fetus's bodily autonomy, then men can ignore women's bodily autonomy. It is not that murder is worse than rape. If anybody buys into that then by default the guy just explained to them why raping pro choice people is okay. So yeah. That's supporting rape. He may not be supporting himself in raping others, but he is supporting rape in general. In addition, note that his logic isn't consistent- people who are pro choice don't believe that fetuses even have bodily autonomy, so they can't be compared with women in that regard. That being the case, why are you demanding responders to stick to his subjective view, while treating it as whole and consistent, when that view is cherry picking specific and contextless points from others' opinions?</TEXT>

    <TEXT>For one of our anniversaries, my gf and I went to get a massage. It also had a private hot tub, aka clients would use it alone if they came together, behind a closed door. I never went to a spa before so I called to ask if we had to bring swimming clothes and the lady on the phone said technically yes but some people don't in a very suggestive tone. So I told my gf that and she said okay. So the day of the massage we go in the hot tub and get naked. We start making out, I get hard, but have zero expectations of actual sex because I wasn't sure how healthy hot tub sex was, and we already did it that morning anyway (still pretty sure all the chlorine isn't good for lady bits, but somehow nothing happened). And then she climbed on top of me and started riding me (she had an IUD at the time). Which was already hot af, but did feel weird since the water washed away all her natural lube. But we had shower sex a few times by then, so that was nothing new. That went on for a while, her riding me, then stopping to chill in the water, then going at it again, a few times. At some point I got sick of the water sex weirdness, so we got out of the hot tub and laid down next to it to make out a bit. Then we started doing it missionary and for some reason, it felt amazing. Not sure how to describe it, but I was suddenly made aware of how amazing she felt without the water washing away all her natural stuff and warmth. So I lasted like a minute before I came inside her. The thing was, that happened maybe ten minutes before we had to get out of the hot tub to get that massage, and we had no idea what to do with the cum. So she just went back in the hot tub hoping it would go away, which it miraculously did. So that's how we became one of those disgusting couples who turns hot tubs into cum soups.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>So legalising sex work usually has asterisks up the wazoo. Here are the ones that seem most problematic to me. First and foremost- the benefits of legalization almost always apply solely to citizens. That is, tax benefits and medical healthcare? Yeah, only for citizens. When you combine that with the fact that a very very big share of prostitutes are foreigners (because human trafficking is a thing) and you get a pretty bleak picture in which legalization misses the most vulnerable people in the sector it tries to protect. Secondly, a lot of prostitutes don't want other people to know what they do. And, sure, in an ideal world that wouldn't be the case, but in the one we have that means even those who *can* get benefits, won't, because they don't want any records of their occupation to exist. Finally, you know who benefits most from legalization? Pimps. Duh. Their workers have a much, much harder time reporting them, and they get the biggest benefit in that their occupation becomes legal at all. So again going back to those foreign sex workers- their situation got worse in a very big way, in that they can no longer simply report their pimp for pimping. Pimps need to work *slightly* harder to obfuscate abuse, sure, but in return they have waaay more resources to pull that off due to legalisation. The idea that legalising sex work makes prostitutes safer is nice. I don't think it's a reality.</TEXT>

We went to dinner there or something, and in the span of an hour it gets completely dark and starts raining cats and dogs. Now, to anybody who's never been to Norway- the roads are inexcusably horrendous (yes, it has challenging geography for road construction, but so does Finland and the roads there are fine). Extremely narrow, even in dangerous places bordered by nothing but cliffs. And, as we learned that day, the roads are also occasionally very poorly lit. So we get into the car, start driving, and in my head I'm like "no way are we not crashing today". That 10 minute drive took like 20 because I was driving at the speed of a disabled snail. But hey.

    <TEXT>His hatsu is fast enough to possibly let him pull off a win against a rg. Singular. Thing is, with anything but zero hand he probably can't easily deal serious damage to them. If he doesn't use Zeri Hand, the rg could just run away to gang up on him later, which is absolutely something all of them would do unless the king was in danger or something. Using Zero Hand on Pouf would be very bad for Netero since Pouf would very feasibly have a clone somewhere, and Zero Hand doesn't have too great of an aoe to cover that scenario. Idk how many Pouf clones could kill an exhausted Netero though, so it could go either way. Zero Hand could possibly kill Youpi, but it probably wouldn't completely disintegrate any rg's body, which means if he uses it on Pitou, Terpsichora would kill him afterwards, which would mean another tie. So really he could only pull of a relatively certain victory against Youpi, at the cost of being completely out of commission afterwards.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>As a kid, I had a really hard time coming to terms with the fact that, as a male, I would never get to experience pregnancy (pretty okay with it now, only mildly salty). I was 100% sure that modern medicine had come up with something for dudes to do that. Anyway my dumb 14 yo brain concluded that videos of male births would probably not be available in most places. So where do I go? Yup, a porn site. What I ended up finding was a video of a dude pushing out a doll out of his ass. And not of the small variety either. Like actual, human baby sized doll. And it came out so weirdly clean, considering how far up his sewers it must've gone. Needless to say, I was horrified... And told all my friends about it the very next day at school</TEXT>

    <TEXT>A game needs to resemble our world enough to evoke empathy, but it can be as fantastical as your concrete needs demand. The second part doesn't matter and depends on whatever you want to get out of game. Aka anything between gritty realism to wuxia magic. The first part is more universal, imo, because if your game is so out there that players can't get a grasp on how to roleplay it, then their agency in the game world becomes arbitrary. Let's take Exalted as an example. In that game, you usually play newly ascended demigods. The recently part is crucial because without it, your real world experience becomes less applicable, and you have less of a grasp on how your character would act. It is much easier to figure out how a secretary who suddenly gained godlike powers would act, than a 5,000 years old divinity who may have been a secretary at some point, but that was so long ago that it doesn't inform her actions in any way, whereas the cosmic scale factors that *do* inform her actions are completely unrelatable to us normal people. There are advantages to the second scenario, of course. It makes for a neat though experiment, for example. But it is waaay harder to run, for one thing, and is also as mentioned somewhat harder to play.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>The prohibition of homosexuality is most often attributed to lev. 18:22. That section of the old testament, however, deals with property law. So in context, the prohibition is more of owning a man as a husband owns his wife. Which, coincidentally, people who believe in the prohibition of homosexuality by power of that verse, kind of need to believe in, otherwise that's picking and choosing between verses in the same chapter. Aka, if you do not believe women are property of their husbands, why do you believe that homosexuality is a sin?</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Jean Grey, the second time, in Grant Morrison's New X Men. Her first death was iconic and shocking, and came in an era where it was expected that superheroes just don't die. Her second death felt cheap, came out of nowhere, and while it could be argued that it was the culmination her character arc, it happened at the end of an arc that already did way too much for shock value (*ahem* Magneto), without proper buildup, and without even giving her enough time to show off what she could do. Honestly the most shocking thing about her second death is that it actually mostly stuck for fifteen years. I say mostly because she came back for one miniseries, but that was for like a couple of hours in-universe so I don't count it.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Copyright is context sensitive. Aka the word echoes is not protected, just the word Echoes as it is used in regard to music. You're right, had any other manga used the word Echoes to refer to, say, an attack, it would've been fine (probably), except Araki uses it explicitly to refer to the band, which is a copyright infringement and probably also a trademark violation. You could easily prove that that is indeed the intended context as well with a ton of Araki interviews. It's actually a pretty interesting case, since in isolation, no Stand creates the context neccesary to prove that it's actually a music reference, but put together it becomes obvious.

Then, last year, my gf and I got a 100% irrefusable incredible offer to catsit a couple of cats for a year in exchange for living an entire year rent-free in a fully equipped house. Even the cat stuff costs weren't on us. Anyway my gf had cats for most of her life so she was immediately cool with them. I never had cats and at first I was afraid. I was petrified. Because I had no idea how to deal with cats. In addition, one of them loved attention but had some kinda brain thing that made him wobble a bit, whereas the other was perfectly healthy but if you dared pet her there was a 55% chance she would slap your sorry ass. A year later when we had to say goodbye I was heartbroken. I grew attached so fucking hard. And now I really want another cat but the landlord doesn't. But hey. At least these two cats are in good hands.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Hi sexxit So my gf wants to get a Kyleena. She had a Mirena before, which, after three and a half years, gave her an ovarian cyst that refused to go away. So her doc said to take the IUD out, which made the cyst go away. We've been using condoms for a year and a bit now, and she decided to ask if it would be a good idea to get a new IUD. Her doctor suggested a Kyleena, and said that IUD has a lower hormone dosage and is therefore less likely to cause ovarian cysts. I didn't go with her, so I've got some questions for people/partners of people who had that IUD: 1. Any babies? I read that it's only very slightly less safe than a Mirena. That's still pretty damn safe, isn't it? 2. Any periods? I'm only asking because my gf said that periodlessness was one of the things she liked the most about the Mirena. 3. Anything else we should know before getting one? We already had an IUD before, we know to not have unprotected sex for a few weeks after she gets it and to go to the doctor again to make sure it didn't get ejected. Thanks!</TEXT>

As for the blowjob thing (and assuming this other thing gets resolved) , you could see if other people with jaw conditions have posted solutions. It could just be a matter of changing your technique.

    <TEXT>How Hisashi Ouchi died. He was there when accidental nuclear fission happened in the plant he was working at in Japan. He was exposed to several times the radiation levels that are considered lethal. He was fine for a while. But unknown to him, the radiation had destroyed his chromosomes. His body was running on cells it already had at the time of the accident, but it couldn't make new ones. Later on he was hospitalised as he began showing symptoms of that. He more or less rotted alive. The pictures that come up when you search his name are also very nsfw, but to my understanding they are all fake and there are no real pictures of how he looked like as he died. He survived for a few months in that state. There's also a story on the internet that even though he had zero chances of survival and was in extreme agony, the doctors wouldn't agree to euthanize him in order to study what was happening to him. This is probably inaccurate. Firstly because Ouchi was unconscious for most of his hospital stay. Secondly, because it seems that the doctors needed the consent of his family to euthanize Ouchi, but his family didn't want to do that (but the question then becomes whether or not the hopelessness of Ouchi's condition was properly explained to his family).</TEXT>

    <TEXT>When my grandpa died. He lost a lot of his independence and clarity by the time it happened. He kept mistaking me for my dad (we're not that alike). It also happened right at the end of a very very long series of internship interviews, so even after he died I couldn't grieve properly because I had to also worry about how the interviews went. He died from a stomach virus he caught at the elderly home my grandma put him in, btw. Against the rest of the family's protests, and even though she had both space and money to hire someone to look after him constantly at home. I knew putting him there would kill him, but I didn't stop her.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Lol. Clearly you haven't played games that actively try to stop you from running them as written. Pick any edition of Exalted, for example. Even if you somehow don't run into any of the system's other worst flaws, at the end of the day you'll still be stuck with an agonizingly slow game that takes literally half an hour to resolve a fucking action, the most adamant defendants of which argue that you should just ignore the system most of the time (without seeing how that's basically admitting you might as well use another system entirely). Or take DnD 3.5 for example. Just try running a campaign that includes characters of as low as 7th level in which you have both spellcasters and melee characters without making the none-magic users feel hopelessly outmatched in every category. None of which is to say crunch is always bad (although I will point out how very presumptuous of you it is to just assume everybody who recommends lighter systems are all after the same thing). But the system does matter. If you want to run a court intrigue game, you probably shouldn't do it with a game that assumes several combat encounters will happen every day as part of its balance. If you want to run a lighthearted space opera game, maybe don't use the game in which magic is horrible and magic users often suffer horribly for using their powers. It really is quite unfounded to say that any system can go with any game.</TEXT>

Cohabitation means I also get to hang out with that person often, while schedule differences mean I still get to play video games.

And yeah, sex is also a very nice thing to be having on a regular basis. There are difficulties. But I think most things are workable. I struggle a lot with expressing myself in time (aka before issues grow or pile up), but I'm working on it. Oh! She's also really good at snapping me out of my anxiety.

Before that, we used condoms every time we did PiV. So the first time we did it bareback I was obviously having a great time. Pretty soon I was close to finishing and realized I had no idea where she wanted me to cum. So I asked if she wanted me to pull out, since I assumed that she may be nervous about potential pregnancies. She said no and pulled me closer. I didn't last long after that, and I learned that creampies are the best thing in the world.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Very true. I mean, consider for a moment who else could possibly go after high bounties. First off- the Marines. They don't do it for money. And if somebody outside the marines goes after high bounties, it seems to me like they would see so much cool shit money can't buy, that they would develop other aspirations along the way and wind up as pirates. Money is also kinda worthless in the world of One Piece. Devil Fruits are prohibitively expensive. And as Don Krieg taught us, you can buy as many ships and hire as many men as you want, and it still won't compare to one rando with strong aspirations and the will to go after them. Even the Marines, who seem to rely on money quite a bit, would be nowhere near as powerful without Vegapunk, whose main asset seems to be his mind. With all that in mind, I think high tier bounties aren't really meant for bounty hunters. First and foremost, they're warning signs for the marines to refer to, and maybe, maaaybe they're also meant to incentivize the Shichibukai, who are the only ones outside the marines who are both powerful enough to defeat people with such bounties, without being pirates who cannot claim bounties anyway.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Pulling out while wearing a condom isn't really neccesary. Just don't stay inside too long after you cum, since when you go soft the condom loosens and cum can slip out. For the same reason, when you pull out after you cum, hold the base of the condom. You can tell whether or not the condom broke by holding it with the opening facing up, if the cum kinda pools at the tip and none of it leaks, it's probably fine. Don't freak out if you see some white stuff on the condom after you're done, that could be perfectly normal vaginal discharge. One more tip: if you put on a condom using the wrong side, don't flip sides, just throw the condom away. Precum can sometimes contain semen, so if the side that will be touching your gf got in contact with your dick that could cause problems (even if the chances of this happening are very very low).</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I was a late bloomer who looked like a 14 year old girl at 18 years old. It sucked. But puberty does do its job eventually. Buuut as other people have said, there are healthy habits you can adopt right now that will greatly benefit you in the long run. I honestly eat a lot of garbage, so I'll talk about exercise instead. Find something you like. That's the only way to make sure you stick to it. Try different things and see what sticks. It doesn't have to be stuff like football, I for example hate most sports but climbing really got to me. Swimming is also very good for weight loss. You could also try martial arts if you're into that. Btw 120 pounds isn't a lot btw. Chubby cheeks could also be attributed to puberty, but it might also just be how your face is always gonna look, which isn't a big deal imo. I guarantee it is mostly a problem in your eyes. People who will like you anyway are going to either not care about it or like it since those cheeks are attached to a person they like (or, y'know, because some people are just gonna like them visually).</TEXT>

    <TEXT>While pregnancy scares are certainly scary, please try and remember that condoms are (when used correctly) very reliable, as well as that periods can be late for reasons other than pregnancy, such as stress. Freaking out is definitely understandable though. The first time my gf's normally highly predictable period was late, we both freaked out, and I'm pretty sure tears were involved when she took a pregnancy test ten days later. But it was negative. Also, if you haven't yet, in the likely case this turns out to be a false alarm, talk about what you'd do if you did turn out to be pregnant. It's important for your joint peace of mind.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>She punched your balls so hard you threw up. Why would you stay in this situation? Also, lots of women like cum. If not as a thing in and of itself, then as something that comes (har har) out when their guy feels good because of them.

So allow me to reassure you that expecting your partner to make you feel wanted, to not humiliate you, and to not fucking punch you in the balls, that's all well within the realm of reason.

One, it was weird to him that this was an issue, since when he got his degree paying rent while studying was doable (to clarify, I was working a part time job while studying but it was nowhere near enough for me to afford rent). Two, because his little sister never moved out and still lives with my grandma. But he mostly wanted me to be independent because he knew it would make me happy. It did, but I'm also happy I didn't move out early because then I'd be in pretty heavy debts by now.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Really hard to say. On the one hand, the only people Ace lost to were extremely powerful. On the other hand, he wasn't doing too well against any of them. People say Ace did well against Blackbeard, but it really didn't look like any of Ace's attacks did much damage. Blackbeard is a tank, but he often still looks like he's hurt by attacks that do very little to him. He was hit by Luffy in impel down and *looked* hurt, but considering we know he can take attacks from whitebeard there's no way Luffy could have seriously hurt him. Speaking of Whitebward, Blackbeard took two of his attacks, seemed extremely wounded by both... And then went on to fight Sengoku, and take an attack from him (probably more than one). And after all that he was still standung and was mostly finr. Point being, just because he seemed to be hurt by Ace's attacks doesn't mean he actually took any real damage. And that leaves us with very little by which to determine how strong Ace might've been. Considering he took on Smoker, who could have harmed Ace with his cane so it wasn't the DF stalemate people say it was, and was also offered a Shichibukai seat, and considering the other division commanders he should be comparable to, I'd place him at middle Shichibukai tier, so stronger than most other Shichibukai but weaker than, say, Mihawk.</TEXT>

Creative battles, cool locations, probably the largest gallery of weird animals any arc has so far, and of course, my favorite villain in all of One Piece (who also has the most interesting relationship with Luffy). The supporting cast of non-villains is kinda weak, but I prefer that over what we get today, aka very cool non-strawhats who eat waaay too much screen time (like Kyros taking a fight that could have gone to Robin, or about 90% of Wano). Alabasta had a really good balance of straw hats/everybody else screen time. Oh! And Robin joined the crew there too!</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Doesn't bother me at all. I'm honestly surprised by all the hate here. Can we not all agree that 900 episodes are a big time commitment? Even if the non watcher did watch other long shows, how does that matter? Isn't it feasible they wouldn't want to take another, even bigger time commitment? Personally I'm even stingy about playing a lot of rpgs because of how long they can get. I get that cumulatively watching OP is the same as watching a bunch of other shows. Cool. But... If you told me I could either watch one show or watch something like ten other shorter, quality, complete shows, I'd go for the second option personally. I love One Piece but for me it is certainly not better than the combined quality of FMA, Ghost in the Shell, Evangelion, DBZ, and however many other shows you would need to fill up a mass of 900 episodes. And to those people who say you could just drop it midway through- how can you say that when "I just wanna see how it ends" syndrome is so prevalent in the anime community? If you've watched 200 episodes of a show, you may be too committed to stop even if you don't like it anymore. I read around 200 chapters of Bleach because of that.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Same. Man the responses you got so far have been super condenscending. Toki said she'd divorce him? Uh, cool, not really an excuse to ditch her when she's sick, with their children, as well as his retainers that desparately needed him, due to a situation he helped create by giving Orochi money and then by leaving. Had Oden stayed, he may have been able to prevent her death. And Oden knew that he was putting her in danger, at least to an extent, since it is implied he sensed Wano had become a shithole, and yet he left Toki there anyway. What he found with Roger turned out to be bigger? Again, neato, except based on the poneglyphs we knew Oden got to read by that point he had no reason to assume that this would be the case. Conversely, Oden already ditched his retainers to go on an adventure, and then also ditched WB because Roger told him a story (one that could be summed up as "so there's this treasure") so it is much easier to pin his decision on his characteristic impulsiveness and disloyalty. Yes, Imo Oden is disloyal, take me away reddit.</TEXT>

I could see someone wanting emotional support and trying to squeeze something out of a friendship that isn't there to get it. So I'm not sure that I'd expect my gf to stop being that person's friend. Give them a warning on top of a firm rejection and cut them off if they persist, maybe? She's a big girl and I trust her 100% to say no. I don't neccesarily trust that that friend would take no for an answer though, and that's the reason cutting them off may become neccesary.</TEXT>

Yeah, some people forget to take the pill, and for those people the failure rate is much higher, and that falls under *common use*, but there is a failure rate of about 1% for perfect use. Perfect use *does not* refer to incorrect use, it refers only to those people who use their contraceptives flawlessly, and even for those people pregnancies can still happen.

    <TEXT>I agree with this list almost entirely. My one gripe is that I think Hancock should be one tier higher. People sleep on her a lot, but she could one shot Pacifistas before the timeskip, aka at a time when it took an entire supernova crew to defeat one of those things (which btw shows that some applications of her df cannot be resisted by pain or lack of attraction, since pacifistas are mindless machines). On top of this, she has famously good haki and was one of the few characters who came out of marineford completely uninjured (alongside characters like Doflamingo and Mihawk). But it is true that she lacks feats against the likes of other Shichibukai or Yonko commanders, so I can sorta see why people underestimate her.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I think a part of the problem is that people assume Hancock's hax can be resisted with pain and such. That's only true for Mero Mero Mellow, aka her big aoe attack. If she kicks someone, it doesn't matter whether or not they have dirty thoughts, the part she touched gets petrified, as seen when she one shots a pacifista, when she breaks Smoker's cane, and when she petrified a cannonball. Which is pretty insane. The cannonball example was from when she used Slave Arrow, which is a ranged attack, so it's not even just kicks that Hancock can use against strong people.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Yeah this is what I like to call the Phoenix problem. The Phoenix did way more good than bad before AvX. Jean Grey went Dark exactly one time (I don't count Endsong), and it only happened because she got brainwashed. But for some reason AvX's writers decided it was a cosmic destroyer (a proposition that Jean herself explicitly rejected in New X Men), and in that story they pushed that vision so hard that that belief became the default for all of the Avengers for some reason, and to force them into being the good guys they made the Phoenix inherently corrupting, and introduced no less than five eeeeeevil phoenix hosts. And the phoenix keeps getting portrayed as evil ever since, to the point that in the recent Resurrection story even the X Men are all convinced that if it bonds with Jean again the world will go boom. Even though Jean spent most of her time as regular or White, not Dark, Phoenix. Oh and it gets so bad even Jean buys that crap eventually. Tl;dr comic book memory is incredibly foggy, if writers decide a character is evil, then that's that</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Not sure. When Rayleigh was talking to Robin he said he and his crew weren't able to do anything, but that the Straw Hats may come to a different conclusion. That's not something he'd say if he only needed Poseidon, especially since Shirahoshi had already been born at the time. Although... Maybe he meant to say that his crew was too early, as in didn't do their research? I agree that One Piece may require the ancient weapons for whatever reason. But since Rayleigh and the rest of Roger's crew never came back to Laugh Tale even after Shirahoshi was born, I think it's possible a person can only visit Laugh Tale once per lifetime. Either that or all three weapons are required, in which case Shirahoshi wouldn't be enough since Roger's crew had no idea where Pluton and Uranus were. Maybe a combination of all of these things? Aka you need all three weapons and can also only visit LT once? It's also possible the Rio Poneglyph states all that, but Roger couldn't wait because he was already dying. But Idk if that's actually the case, since slapping a hunt for the two missing weapons (or even just Uranus since Franky may have memorized Pluton's blueprints) would make the manga much longer than the "halfway done" thing would suggest.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Yeah, funny detail about Robin as well is that she's apparently very strong physically. This is probably unintentional on Oda's part, but, uh... She carried Yama using just two chains of arms. So the top arm of each chain would need to be strong enough to not only support Yama's highly significant weight, but also the weight of quite a few other arms. ...come to think about it I'm not even sure it was a mistake since just a handful of Robin's arms could force a Pacifista's mouth shut. But then, if she's that strong physically, why didn't she just beat Spandam up even with her arms restrained? Anyway yes, Robin is OP. We all know that. It's part of the reason it was so frustrating to see her fight against Diamante stolen by Kyros (and it was a pretty meh fight too since Kyros has absolutely no interesting abilities).</TEXT>

Otherwise, it's a pick your poison kind of deal- learning 3e and all the different Charm interactions over a book that's inexcusably bloated is about as easy as chewing rocks, but if you (and your players, good luck finding a group of people willing to learn that book, or books if you're not playing Solars) it's pretty smooth sailing. Whereas, 2e is much easier to learn but breaks down violently and then explodes as a game progresses and what you thought were cracks in the system turn out to be gasoline filled chasms that are rapidly approached by a lit fuse.</TEXT>

    <DATE>2020-01-16 20:57:06</DATE>
    <TEXT>So Fate is a popular, rules light game. I like rules light games. But Exalted is my favorite setting (destiny has been cruel to me I know). So theoretically, a Fate game of Exalted should be right my alley, right? Well, maybe, but the Fate core book is pretty long, and takes forever to explain even simple concepts. This makes me worried that it is not, in fact, as friendly as people claim it is, or even if it is that a good Exalted hack would crunchify it to the point where it is no longer for me. Hene the question- did any of y'all ever run a FateXalted game? If so, how did it go? Would you recommend it? Input from people who read relevant Fate hacks but never ran a game are also welcome!</TEXT>

    <TEXT>What the title says, I am super stoked! All right, so my experience running into Farron Keep, after Cathedral of the Deep, is probably super common ("ugh, not a poison level please Gwyn"), wasn't a fan of it at first. But! When I first bumped into the fires you need to put out, that was pretty cool. It's a neat little puzzle, which was made infinitely better by the fact I found it *after* I lit the wolf bonfire, so I could go there to find the remaining towers immediately. The buildup to the Watchers is great. Creepy music, cool door outside the area leading up to the boss (that looks suspiciously like the Throne of Want door in DS2), the fighting sounds outside the actual boss door are a great touch too. The actual boss seemed easy enough at first. I was all, "damn, that 2v2 drained most of my estus but hey, I wo- wait why did the boss get up and turn into Lady Maria?" And with the bit of estus I had left I got the bastard to half health and died. Or maybe it was two thirds. Not sure. Ok, round two... Ended outside the boss door as the annoying mobs got me. But round three! Ended much like round one since my shield isn't great and my damage isn't terrific either. A word about my build. It's Faith, with way too many points put into Faith for this part of the game, even with a scaling weapon (Saint Bident +4, which could've been Blessed except that infusion seems aggressively bad). That's intentional, this build has a bad early game as a callback to my first DS2 build, aka my first Soulsborne character, in which I found a Fire Longsword super early and put even moar points into faith thinking that's what you're supposed to do playing a cleric (it was not, having 50 faith before killing the four great soul bosses was a terrible idea). Anyway back to the boss and me getting rekt. I suddenly remembered I got Lightning Spear earlier in the swamp. Now, having played ds2 I assumed it would be crap, since in that game regular lightning spear did negligible damage (and also had shit casting time and very few casts). But I figured I might as well try it. It did about 1.5 times the damage of my normal attacks, from afar. Which is nuts (but that's with a miracle boosting ring), and the casting time was also much faster than I expected (but also, thanks to a relevant ring). Two minutes later (during which I had to learn the spell's animation and speed, missed a lot- so happy ashen estus is a thing- and took some damage for that, probably should've gotten some practice elsewhere) and the Watchers went down! So that felt great, can't wait for the next boss that will mop the floor with me hard enough to make me see what I could be using and forgot about.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>All right, Sarada's Chidori was extremely cool, but I don't think this was the time to reveal it. She needed something that doesn't require hand seals and is also very quick, right? Well, Chidori kinda requires hand seals. I say kinda because in Shippuden Sasuke rarely needed to perform hand seals for any of his Chidori variants. If Sarada learned her Chidori from someone who uses it without hand seals it could make sense (kid Sasuke still needed hand seals since he learned his Chidori from Kakashi, who also needed them at the time). But that's a bit contrived, especially since Sarada already has super strength that should allow her to rip through Moro's core, without requiring hand seals. Granted, it isn't fast enough, but if she caught Moro by surprise he still wouldn't be able to move his core. And he had 3 other people to deal with, surprising him sounds feasible to me. Either that or Mitsuki could impede Boro's hand seals using his snakes.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>It's pretty cool aesthetically... At first. Sadly DS3 seems to have an overabundance of cathedrals, which makes even the Deep one feel less special. The boss is shit. This is made worse by the fact that it's really just a bunch of goons, both gameplay and lore wise. The level itself though is neat. Lots of cool looking enemies (few of which are actually that dangerous, though) and a few unique traps, as well as the rare non-obnoxious side quest. And the run from the second bonfire to the first shortcut hits that sweet spot of making you stretch your resources pretty thin to get there without being obnoxious, so that you feel great when you finally rest at that bonfire. Tl;dr it's a solid level that has problems.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Both may not have always been evil but are 100% pure evil when you find them. We don't know what Sully's deal was before he found the profaned flame, but it corrupted him into seeking power at all costs. The fact he sought it out may indicate that he was a greedy bastard even before that. Aldrich apparently had a vision of the world being consumed by Dark. This could have motivated him to consume the (possibly dying) Gwyndolin to obtain and preserve his power, and use it to prolong the Age of Fire. One small problem with that theory- Aldrich was a cannibal. Maybe the vision made him this way, but it's just as likely that he was one even before that. His cannibalism also wasn't purely utilitarian, it's explicity pointed out he enjoyed the suffering he inflicted upon his victims. Regardless, Aldrich ate so many people he lost the ability to leave his room, to say nothing of stopping the Dark. So Aldrich's brand of evil gives him less agency than Sulyvahn had, but they're both equally irredeemable.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>It is so weird you think it's one or another- either tell a story about demigods being awesome, or have mechanics that allow you to create mechanically challenging scenarios (on top of, apparently, either have a fight that's momentous to the story *or* one that's mechanically challenging). But your biggest misconception seems to be that "challenge" means "random". No. What OP is asking for is not a scenario in which an unlucky roll could ruin a story (never mind that a good storyteller would make a loss interesting as well), but rather one that requires characters to invest a lot of their resources and still risk defeat or serious consequences. Exalted is astoundingly bad at this, most of your scenarios will include either the PCs running all over the opposition, or them getting curb stomped. It is extremely hard to consistently achieve anything in between these results. And that's just a flaw of the system that has nothing to do with portraying demigods. You can portray cosmic-scale beings in Hero System and the game still provides you with the tools to challenge players. Godbound actually makes this almost effortless. Both do it without compromising you story's integrity. I honestly don't know how it's still a contentious argument that Exalted is bad at guiding storytellrs in trying to create challenging encounters. The book doesn't even try.</TEXT>

    <TITLE>Beasts of Sulyvahn- the banes of my existence</TITLE>
    <DATE>2020-01-26 07:27:30</DATE>
    <TEXT>Basically title. The first one you run into on the bridge isn't that bad. All it's guarding is a somewhat situational ring. The ones that messed me up are the ones in the reservoir. The ones you need to beat to get a fucking amazing ring and also a bonfire I kinda noped out of there at first when I saw there were two of them. But after finding the shortcut to the Pontiff bonfire, I mustered the courage to give them a go. Luring one of them away to avoid the terrifying prospect of fighting two of those things was pretty easy, even without using a bow. That said: Uuuuugh fuck those things with a Zweihander I hate them so much. They have one ultra punishable move- the lightning breath. Anything else and they could combo most of my hp pool away in a second (that's with 30 vig, embers, and a life ring). Their tells all look pretty similar too, and if you get even a bit greedy with your hits you'd better be prepared to make the run back from the bonfire over. And over. And over again. The fucking deacons hurling fireballs at you every time suck too. Oh and the puppies also have health pools that could make a boss feel inadequate. I died to Pontiff Sulyvahn three or four times (thank you, poise Lightning Stake). His damned dogs killed me about ten times. Idk how it is they aren't the ones running the whole operation. It might be because they can't climb ladders.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>You get Lightning infusions pretty late, so I wouldn't bother waiting for those. But you can pick up a Saint Bident in Cathedral of the Deep, and it scales with Faith. Don't infuse it with Blessed though, it tanks your AR and the bident's damage is already pretty meh (it's range however, is incredible). Other than that, pick up Lightning Spear in Farron Keep, but expect most of your damage to be weapon-based until you get Lightning Stake in Smouldering Lake. As for stats, get them to what you need to wield your weapon of choice (I'd recommend Lothric SS for infusion or Sunlight SS for Lightning Blade) and that'll allow you to use the Bident as well, most likely. Pump Vig to at least 25 pronto. You probably don't need more than 16 attunement, if you need more slots, spending a ring slot beats pumping 8 more levels into att. Upgrade your Faith as well, the bident isn't worth it if you don't have at least 30 faith. That's all I've got. Have fun!</TEXT>

So when Luffy beat him and he started trying again, that's the reason he gets to do so much in Marineford.

    <DATE>2020-01-27 13:02:45</DATE>
    <TEXT>Hi guys, So I'm running a faith build, and want a weapon to use in PvP. I'll probably have 20 dex, 60 faith. These two swords look great. However, I am not interested in buffs (can't spare the attunement slot and applying them seems like a hassle). In light of that, Lothric SS seems like the obvious choice, since you can infuse it and it gets S scaling in Faith, while Sunlight only gets B. But then you deal with split damage. Is the Lightning Lothric SS still superior to the Sunlight SS in light of that?</TEXT>

    <TEXT>No, I did not change my point. I simply ignored your question about Bartolomeo and co. Since it is irrelevant and I'm only regarding responsibilities Oden accepted. And I never said you said anything about the Daimyo title, so I'm not putting any words in your mouth. Relax. I thought we were discussing Oden's choices in general, not just ones we listed, and so assumed you had that point in mind as well, including when you implied that Oden never accepted any responsibility for Kuri. I'm sorry if that wasn't the case. But that's a moot point since you just validated what I said by claiming that maybe Oden did just happen to become Daimyo. Which I strongly disagree with, considering how stoked he was to get it. It is because it reads to me like Oden actively wanted to be Daimyo that your comparisons to Dressrosa and Alabasta are false equivalencies. About Toki, it seems to me like family comes before a "dream" Oden picked up on the fly, out of nowhere, just cuz Roger told him some stuff. Especially since he could sense something was wrong with Wano when he was there. That Toki threatened to divorce him is pretty insignificant in light of the fact he left her sick in a place he could feel was not safe for her. And if my problem is that I expect a lot out of characters and not too much about their dreams, I'd say yours is that these dreams supercede responsibilities in your eyes too much. Oden ignored his responsibilities, and now has to face the music. Oh btw, he himself regrets the consequences of his shitty choices. The hypocrite suddenly wants Wano (demands, really), and even said that it "would certainly improve under his rule". Lol. Yeah, unless he vanishes for another half decade or so for shits and giggles. But, yeah, I am absolutely projecting my own personal belief that people who are completely self serving until it's too late unto this story. I just didn't think that that point would be so contentious.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Dark Souls is weird in that in each game, the player character is only around for the shitty part of the cycle- it's end. There is actually something to look forward to. And since you're Unkindled you may even live to see it. Nothing good happens in the Age of Dark. In Dark Untended Graves, and then in Dark Firelink, we can see, and are also told, that not a soul stirs in the Dark. But I think that's because the First Flame needs to build up the strength to create something new again. And it will (again, except maybe in the Usurpation ending), as it has done many times in the past. Irithyll, Anor Londo, Lothric, Drangleic and Lordran were all built and inhabited by countless people once. And once the flame reignites, new kingdoms will eventually follow. Unless you Usurp the Fire. In that case, a new age will never come, and the world will be still forever. It will never have to die again, because it will stay dead.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>For some reason a lot of people avoid answering your question. Where I live, this would be a highly relevant concern, since most people here get circumcised for religious reasons. There's even a majority of people who don't get circumcised as babies who decide to do it later in life. To answer your question, it will be painful. But it is equally painful for babies. The recovery, however, will be considerably lengthier. That said, I'm not aware of any sources that show the recovery will be more or less complete for adults. Anecdotally, a friend of mine who did it as an adult (because of phimosis, not for religious reasons) said it hurt like hell for a few weeks, but that sex afterwards was pretty much the same. In addition, adults notice and can complain when something's wrong. Babies can't. I've read about several cases in which circumcision caused necrosis in a baby (more to do with inappropriate bandaging but nonetheless), had this happened to an adult they would have had more of a chance to speak up and get treatment. In light of all this, it seems to me like you're making the correct decision. Yes, the procedure isn't as breezy for adults as it is for babies. But it is still pretty low risk, and the increase in recovery time (IF you kid decides to do it) can't, imho, beat the weight of violating your kid's body by doing it to him as a baby.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I would never ever not use a condom with a new partner. Wearing one when you're not neccesarily exclusive, don't know if the other person is clean etc. Is just common sense. That said, yes, the difference between sex with condoms and bareback is like... Night and day. I actually forgot how good sex feels without a condom. Then my gf got a new IUD recently, after a few years of not having one. I was blown away. To describe the difference, let's say a vagina in a PiV situation has four main fun factors: tightness, wetness, texture, and warmth. Well, with a condom, you can mostly just feel tightness, everything else is either muted or downright blocked. And condom companies try to advertise their condoms as featuring some of those things (like better heat transmission, lubrication, or skin like texture). Oh, they try so very hard. But nothing can compare to the real thing they're trying to emulate. But that improvement definitely doesn't make up for risking pregnancies or STDs.</TEXT>

    <TITLE>Dark Heresy/WFRP style spellcasting</TITLE>
    <DATE>2020-02-09 20:34:56</DATE>
    <TEXT>Hi guys, So I recently read the Fate core book, followed by Condensed (which is a godsend). It is a fantastic system. Now, I want to run WFRP with it. Generally most things don't require special rules, I find, in regard to that setting in Fate. You can even take, say, divine spellcasting, say you need an aspect to access it (Priest of Sigmar or something, probably as a high concept since that's quite a broad aspect), use that aspect to justify magical stunts that work just like regular stunts but with permission to do magical things (like healing, setting stuff on fire, talking to wolves or whatever), and if you feel that's a bit powerful, harp on annoying the gods as frequent compels. Wizardly spellcasting- which I'll call Arcane even though the setting doesn't use that word commonly because that's what most people will intuitively understand without needing to understand the setting- is different. It is dangerous to use. In many ways, it is adversarial to the wizard, in that whenever a wizard casts a spell, she essentially opens a door to hell, and there are things on the other side of that door trying to get out and do terrible things. Could you handle that with compels? Maybe, but I feel that doesn't quite capture the danger of arcane spellcasting in the setting. So my idea on how to deal with arcane spellcasting is this: First, like with the aforementioned divine spellcasting, you must have a relevant aspect (Hedge Witch, Bright Wizard, Necromancer and so on). Possessing such an aspect, you gain permission to use skills in magical contexts, without requiring specific stunts. So, while a normal person wouldn't be able to talk to the dead spirits that inhabit that haunted graveyard to ask them who has been robbing their graves recently, an Amethyst Wizard, aka the death-y flavor of wizard in WFRP, would be able to do that, with whatever relevant skill they'd normally need to talk to people (Rapport, probably, or Provoke if you're a dick). In order to not neuter other stunts, this would need to explicitly \*not\* allow wizards to create rules exceptions nor to swap skills. You won't use Magic in place of Shoot to create magic missiles automatically, you'd need a stunt for that. But that's quite a broad advantage. To even this out and create that sense of danger I mentioned, my idea is that, whenever Wizads uses magic, the DM also sets a Warp score, to represent the fact that even as the Wizard uses her magic to do something, hell is trying to break loose. The Warp score is set by stuff like how extreme the magical endeavor is, whether or not the location in which the spell is performed is saturated with magical mojo, etc. The default Warp score should probably be Mediocre (+0), or higher if the Wizard tries something that's outside her chosen school (except minor magic, which is fair game to everyone). The Wizard won't automatically know the Warp score she's contesting, although perhaps a Magic overcome roll could reveal it. Alternatively, say the Warp score is fixed to somerthing low and breezy (like Mediocre) but set relevant Aspects that the Warp can invoke to best the Wizard (like Eclipse or Ground Soaked in Blood). In this case, the Warp would also need to be made susceptible to compels. Whenever the Wizard's roll is equal to or less than the Warp score, bad things happen. On a tie, maybe the spell fails, or succeeds at a cost. On anything worse than that, the GM can decide that the Warp score is treated as if something (terrible) was rolling against the Wizard in some way. So, say the Warp wins by +2 against the Wizard's roll. Even though the Wizard's action may have succeeded (say, because it was very easy, like lighting a candle with magic), since the Warp still won, the spell could go off, but the Warp would have also created an advantage against the Wizard (such as setting her on fire). Or, the DM could decide that the Warp had attacked the Wizard, and magical consequences, when they happen, should be understood as being very very bad and to have as much free reign regarding the crap they can do as to balance out the Wizard's broad abilities that she doesn't have to buy as stunts. WFRP staple magical consequences include mutations, insanity, and of course, summoning or being posseseed by demons. So the gist is that Wizards can do lots of cool shit with their skills, at the cost of having someone/thing try to sabotage them whenever they use those abilities. Stunts to mitigate Warp shenanigans should probably be allowed, but they should always be specific (as usual) and should never reliably eliminate it althogether. So that's my wall of text. Any feedback would be greatly appreciated. Thanks for reading!</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I think my problem with magical compels as the biggest sources of danger to spellcasters from spellcasting is that using them in extreme ways would often feel either unjustified or players would just spend fate points to negate them. Also, since you get the same amount of fate points from letting a demon invade the material realm as you would by conceding that you need to steal that gem since you're Tempted by Shiny Things, players could feel that they're getting shitty deals. As opposed to having some other force that normally wouldn't be able to put severe consequences on you, and if it does that could only happen if you cast in dangerous circumstances or with all your stress boxes and consequences used up.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>The second option. Even seasoned wizards can theoretically accidentally kill themselves with minor magic. But if they're being careful, the chances of that happening are low. Which I tried to emulate here- if you cast with many open stress boxes, consequence slots, and fate points, and if you have relevant stunts or advantages, you'll almost certainly be fine. But you can never know for sure that circumstances you're unaware of haven't raised the Warp score, nor can you be sure you won't roll poorly.</TEXT>

    <TITLE>Stunts that give bonuses against hostile invokes/consequences?</TITLE>
    <DATE>2020-02-13 08:32:04</DATE>
    <TEXT>I was just wondering how viable this idea would be. The stunt could be called Immune to Pain and say "gain +2 to defend against attacks in which the attacker invokes any pain-related aspect that you have." So essentially, you can ignore invokes regarding a lot of consequences (though not of them, obviously, Blinded would still work)... Kinda. If you have more than one such aspect and more than one of them gets invoked, the stunt as I worded it would still only provide a +2. Idk if writing it as applying cumulatively per invoke would be too powerful. So... Thoughts? On the one hand, neutering consequences seems weird. On the other hand, this stunt seems sufficiently specific (it only applies to attacks). The one thing that worries me is that it might also devalue severe consequences, which are supposed to be a big deal, so maybe it shouldn't apply to those. Edit: another iffy bit about such a stunt- fate points are supposed to give you an advantage. I worry that a stunt like this that negates them would do something to the fate point economy. Which isn't a problem with a stunt that gives a bonus to an attack following an attack against you aided by a relevant invoke, but is a bit of a problem with a stunt that aids defenses.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I personally despised season 3. For me it could've ended on season 1 or 2. Before the cringy mandala sex scene preferably. As for Dark Souls... The story felt done, honestly. People hated DS2's story for secretly being about rekindling the fire, but the hopelessness of the cycle, and its inevitability, are sorta the whole point of the plot. And then they did it again for 3 and people were weirdly happy with it again...? Even though, in DS2, the idea was original (since DS1 never implied the fire would ever fade again after being linked), and it just got recycled in DS3. And yeah, okay, Usurpation shows a way to end the cycle. Hurray. Now we can have a tyrant a la Gwyn times a hundred. And since the age of fire faded even with the Lord Souls around, it seems to me like the Age of Dark will too, even with the First Flame consumed. Even if it doesn't, eventually some Hollow rando will kill the Dark Lord and release Fire again. Point is, there is no point, and three games to hammer that point home is plenty already. I love these games to death. But enough is enough. Now gimme Bloodborne 2 Miyazaki.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>This hurts to read. I'm a guy, and I love my parents, but they did some of what you wrote with me (my sister and my age gap is three years, but I was a very, very, very late bloomer so she was stronger than me for most of our childhood). My sister now has a hard time taking no for an answer as well as a bad temper, while I have a hard time in trying to speak up and express my needs or issues. And it kind of ruined our relationship. We were besties as young children but, because my parents would usually take her side, she got progressively more assertive, whereas I stopped interacting with her since I knew our parents wouldn't help me if things escalated. We don't really have a relationship now. And on the one hand, I'm happy for her. She's a real go-getter. I have zero doubts that she's gonna make it in life because she's so good at pushing for what she wants. And, y'know, I'm an introvert, maybe we were just meant to grow apart because of our differences. But I do miss her sometimes, even though it's been 15 years since we were close in any way.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Fuck up WoW Classic in what regard? The game is selling extremely well, on a recurring payment basis to boot. Why would that do anything but increase share price? As for Blitz, that shitshow cost Blizz very few HS players. The game is still hugely successful and every expansion they released since did well too. I'm a bit surprised Reforged didn't do anything to hurt Blizz's bottom line. Then again, it was clearly a tiny investment on their part. So to sum up: the only botched major release Blizz had recently was Reforged, which was probably very cheap to make. In light of that, why are you surprised that they're doing well overall? EA pumps up shitty release + PR disaster combos at an alarming frequency, and they're still drowning in money.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Yeah I know clumsiest title ever. But anyway, someone here just posted a question about a battle between characters in a superhero setting and it got me thinking... What do you do when one aspect seems to heavily imply superiority over another aspect? To use an example from the core book, say a character has the aspect World's Strongest Man, while another character simply has Very Strong. It seems to me like fiction would demand that one of those would be superior to another. But that royally screws over the Very Strong guy, whose aspect is worth exactly the same as the World's Strongest Man aspect (mechanically speaking). Or, to go back to a superhero setting- Emma Frost has a Master Telepath Aspect. Normally she would be able to kick all sorts of ass with it, but Jean Grey is coming after her with her Phoenix Aspect, which again, in-fiction would win against a "regular" telepath. How do you resolve this without making someone feel shitty? Is it with skills and/or stunts? Do you just demand Jean's player to spend more points on the Psionics skill, on top of requiring them to have a plethora of relevant stunts, to back up her Phoenix aspect? Or do you somehow balance it with compels? Such as, the World's Strongest Man having to deal with having a reputation or being challenged constantly, unlike the Very Strong guy, or Phoenix making you lose control sometimes, which Telepath wouldn't.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>It depends on your group. If you had one or more players who obviously tried exploting this approach it would be a problem. But since you're saying your players rarely refuse compels anyway (even when they have nothing to lose, as per your way of doing compels), it seems to me like there shouldn't be a problem.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>1. Aspects aren't the only thing that makes up the fiction in Fate... I'd be surprised that Strongest Man would wipe the floor with Very Strong in an arm wrestling match if the former has Terrible Athletics, for example. That's why I asked if in that example, you would demand backing from other character traits on top of that aspect. In addition, I don't see how surprise is relevant if what we're discussing isn't predictability but rather enjoyability. Even if it's totally predictable that another character's aspect could mean they would win most rolls against you in a certain area (or even that they wouldn't need to roll to win due to narrative permissions), that doesn't invalidate the possibility that the other player would feel bad because they feel their aspect sucks in comparison to another, especially if they also invested in a few extra points in a relevant skill that the Strongest Man didn't put anything into. 2. Honestly, thinking about how that looks like in the comics just accentuates the issue. The first time these two went at it, Emma was essentially an NPC whose purpose was to let Jean, a PC, show off how much stronger she got. That's not a problem at all. It started becoming a problem once Emma became PC-equivalent, much later. Because the differences in those two characters' abilities remained mostly the same, except now people were also rooting for Emma, who was consistently portrayed as a straight up worse telepath than Jean. So if you were to rely just on aspects to represent these two characters in that situation, then Emma's player would be right to feel bad, Phoenix as an aspect can do everything Telepath can do and then some. A possible solution could be to split the Phoenix concept into a few aspects, or to require an additional point of refresh for it, to represent how it's essentially multiple aspects rolled into one. So okay, let's say Jean's player wanted a Phoenix aspect. Since that's like having both a Telepath and a Telekinetic aspect, which could feasibly be two separate things in that setting, you could require an additional point of refresh. If Jean's player then wanted to just be a straight-up better Telepath than Emma, Phoenix by itself wouldn't be able to do that (again, completely separate from skills and stunts, since invoking it in a competition wouldn't give a bigger bonus), but Jean could take a Telepath aspect on top of that, if she had an aspect to spare. That seems more fair- the result of being a superior telepath on the merit of aspects alone if very expensive. But again, I think you can fix that with skills and compels, rather than by relying solely and aspects and their relevance to fiction. You've got other tools that shouldn't be ignored. So let's say Jean is a top-notch telepath and telekinetic skills-wise. That's great and all, but that's also a whole bunch of points she won't have in other stuff. If Jean also invested all of her stunts into her superpowers then she would be even more narrowly focused on her superpowers (which is somewhat consistent with her portrayal in the comics as well).</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Like all Fate conversions of crunchy games, it works if you like the flavor and/or setting, but it ditches nearly all of the number crunching. So if what you're after is PF's game-y parts, that's not really there. Which is fine for me, since personally what I like about PF isn't really the crunch, but more how the plethora of character options really gets your imagination going. That's still in there in the conversion you linked, and you can easily apply it to splats it doesn't cover. What are you hoping to get out of it, anyhow?</TEXT>

Who the fuck am I to cut off part of a baby's dick anyway? I won't circumcise if I get a boy. I live in the middle east, it'll raise some eyebrows, but that's no reason to cut off a part of a baby. I'm not particularly mad at my parents for doing it to me. I have no sex-related issues to complain about. But it's a matter of bodily autonomy to me. Even if there aren't many adverse effects to circumcision, doing it to my kid just shouldn't be my decision. It should be his.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Like everybody else already said, difficulty should be based on your specific needs. If you're wondering what the skill levels mean in-fiction, it's pretty intuitive: most people will be Mediocre at most things. People with considerable training could be Fair, or even Good for professionals, while Great represents... well, peak skill. Olympic athletes and such. Which isn't to say a generic goon couldn't possibly get a Great skill level in any way. If your player wants to sneak into a room housing one such goon, but they can't be noticed by the goon (who may be able to trigger an alarm with a push of a button or something) , and the room is also very small and featureless, then that could very feasibly be a Great difficulty overcome roll, or even higher, even though the goon's awareness is probably only mediocre.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Me. I got through four years of law school and one year of internship, and am currently studying for the bar exam. So first off- chasing a good income for five years and still not having it (or any income, I'm unemployed since you need to study eightish hours a day for this fucking thing) is already exhausting. But guess what else? The exam may not even happen because of this fucking outbreak. And my gf and I want to move in late August to somewhere with more employment opportunities, and our lease is ending on early august. She's finishing her degree this august too and already has a position more or less promised there, so we really kinda have to move. But rent is higher there. So if I won't be able to carry my own weight with a job I can only get by passing this fucking exam, then fuck me I guess. I honestly have no idea what we'll even do if that happens. Oh and I am also at a high risk if I get this virus thing (asthma). But somehow that's the least of my worries.</TEXT>

Not knowing whether or not it'll even happen adds an extra layer of stress on top of wondering whether or not I'll pass if it doesn't get cancelled/delayed. That and I've lost any faith I previously had in my government. In fairness, I never liked it all that much, but now I just think they're trying to go full dictatorship mode on the back of this crisis. I live in Israel. Last week the prime minister froze courts activity, which caused his own trial to be delayed to May. A couple of days ago he also orchestrated the parliament(knesset)'s non-activity as well, since its chairman is from his party, which no longer has a majority, and he desparately wants it to not discuss anything in that state. Honestly the interent went apeshit crazy over the fact the government is tracking cell phones to see who came in contact with people who were confirmed as coronavirus carriers, but that's the least of our problems right now (if only because the supreme court said the collected phone data cannot be used until it gets approved by the knesset, which as we've established haas not been allowed to work).</TEXT>

    <TEXT>It was indeed illegal insofar as the knesset chairman's discretion is extremely limited in this case, such that it doesn't (or, indeed, shouldn't have) allowed for the postponing of the assembly of covid commitees, let alone votes on his replacement. Is it a criminal offense? Probably not. But it is an abuse of authority; You can read virtually any of the articles that have been published on this matter by any of the news outlets if you want sources. In fact, even the Knesset's legal counselor's opinion on this matter says as much (which is hilarious, since yuli tried, very, very hard to show it off like it actually supported his position). He said that knesset votes to deal with the covid crisis ASAP, and the chairman only has a sliver of discretion to decide otherwise. Mendelblit's opinion is even harsher on how knesset votes should be held asap and postponing them is illegal, in the sense that he said that government-given orders have no hold on the knesset, which is an independent authority (and, of course, mendelblit's opinion matters significantly more). The tl;dr is basically this. A knesset chairman has some discretion regarding which matters to bring before the knesset, and when to hold votes. But like any other public authority, that discretion is narrowed in certain circumstances, such as emergencies. So the covid crisis already narrows yuli's discretion severely, he must hold meetings regarding that ASAP, for extremely obvious reasons. On top of that, yuli is a chairman of a \*third transitional government\*, which means the time when he was in office by virtue of being democratically elected has long since passed, which further narrows his discretion. But the real and obvious kicker is that he's postponing his own removal of office, which narrows his discretion down to basically zero since he's in a severe conflict of interests.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>No. What you're saying is true only if you assume that the knesset chairman can indeed delay that until the absolute latest date as he wishes with no other guiding principles. He cannot. Again, as I wrote, any public authority's discretion can be limited by various factors. It is never absolute. Yuli's discretion is limited as I already specified. It really isn't as simple as "the law says date A-D was set to do X so you can pick any date between those". Because that would lend itself to arbitrary decisions or decisions led by irrelevant factors (such as, again, extreme conflict of interests).</TEXT>

And abot the second part of your comment, that's kind of sad. Yuli is preventing the formation of parliamentary oversight on the use of emergency measures and you're saying that's fine because politicians are too deep up their own ass to care? I fail to see how the mere fact that a political game is happening is enough to justify in your eyes the impairing of the knesset specfically in a time of crisis.

It's abuse of power to a pretty unprecedented degree, at least by way of that position. And, no, they are not working as best they can. The best way to deal with a crisis like this is with knesset commitees. We know for a fact the right the Likud thinks so too, since that's how they chose to deal with them... so long as they had a majority in the knesset. The moment they stopped having a majority, the public took a second seat to politics. I don't know how you could possibly not see that.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>As opposed to... what exactly? Yeah Knesset meetings are an absolute mess, but at least they're recorded, unlike government decisions- we have no idea what's behind any of those. That said, most knesset commitess are, thankfully, mostly decided by professional opinions behind the scenes, that form up actual moves, with the committees deliberating mostly on the minutae. That's professionals from relevant fields, mind you, not just more politicans. That's why you never see legislation proposals formed from zero by those committees- they just review what's presented in front of them. So that mess you see in those recordings/read in those protocols isn't 100% indicative of what's going on. I'm not saying it isn't a shitshow, but to say that they knesset is useless in dealing with crises isn't true, and saying that the government is much better in contrast is even less true.</TEXT>

AKA he's helping keep a guy in office when that same guy has already shown that his first order of business is his own ass, not the wellbeing of the public. There is indeed a crisis.

    <TEXT>I mean, yeah, that is indeed the point of quarantine in this case- to prevent the healthcare system from collapsing by reducing the number of patients it has to deal with at any one time. That said, I'm not sure China is the example we want to go by here. By most accounts, the quarantine ended too soon, and they are now dealing with a second outbreak (that's mostly censored). And part of the reason for that is tha China doesn't really care about the health of its population. Which is something I hope we can't really say here.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>It's really quite simple and is mostly a combination of what you'd expect would contribute to the situation. The tl;dr is: the measures came way too late (as in a lot of Europe), nobody followed them even when they came, and as you already said Italy has a relatively old population in general. Timing probably has something to do with it too. One European country had to take it extra bad before the others started paying attention. Not sure why exactly that country happened to be Italy specifically- even if it has an older population, why did the virus spread faster than it did in other places which also failed to take it seriously?</TEXT>

But consider the damage that a doctor being forced to spend time he could've spent saving lives on looking for a new apartment could have done. Or even probably did do, in this case, since that guy probably had to spend more time traveling to and from work after he got evicted. And it's a surgeon, too. His time very much equals lives. I know that people don't like it when you ask private people to consider stuff outside their own immediate wellbeing. But that's already required by social distancing, so asking landlords to not kick fucking doctors out seems consistent with that, if nothing else.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Appealing a decision made by a small claims court is usually counterintuitive. As the name suggests, these cases often involve relatively small amounts of money and proceedings in small claims are usually very quick, so you don't need a fortune to pay a lawyer in these cases. An appeal is a different beast entirely and is a much, much longer procedure that could drag for a much longer amount of time. So often it's not worth it- even if you win the other side probably won't be made to pay all of your costs.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I would, yes. I'm definitely not a person with very strong ideals, but had I evicted a guy like that I would be forever ashamed of asking a medical professional for help. Moreover, I would definitely not be able to sleep at night with the knowledge that I may have, say, caused a few other doctors or nurses to stop going to work out of fear of getting evicted in a similar manner- in the middle of a freaking pandemic. Or, y'know, with the possibility that because I just made the guy look for another place to live, he may not have been there to perform some crucial operation or something. Btw, I don't even think the idea that kicking him out was the landlady's only option is even true. Quite franky, I'd volunteer to cook for the guy so that he doesn't have to use the kitchen, and ask him to clean the bathroom after every time he used it. Is any of that foolproof? No. Is it better than taking all of the aforementioned risks? Hell yeah.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I'm not sure what point you're trying to make in that first paragraph. How is their being okay with a doctor living with them relevant? Are doctors notoriously bad roommates or something? In fact, in a different article about the same guy, another landlord he found specifically mentioned that in these times, he'd rather have a doctor in the house. And yes, giving hotel rooms to hospital staff is an excellent solution. But it definitely isn't going to happen in every single place that has medical personnel working it (everywhere). So it's still highly undesirable to have people kicking out nurses and doctors. And again, it's not that I don't get it, it's just that I think it's selfish because the risk created by wasting those people's time by kicking them out is much greater than the risk created by having them stay.</TEXT>

Personally it bothers me rather more that a person could get away with having caused someone to fall ill or even die just because he did it by talking rather than with a syringe or something. Btw, the explanation I gave was rather simplistic. It isn't enough for there to be a remote chance that an expression could cause someone harm for it to be illegal. Usually some high likelihood of damage occuring because of that expression is required. So you're only sanctioning expressions with a high probability of getting people hurt.

    <TEXT>Um. I'm really not a fan of the guy, but I failed to find a single source verifying that he said that in this particular context. But first let me make it clear that: 1. He has indeed been tested postitive for coronavirus 2. He is ultra-orthodox and there is no doubt that his opinion on homosexuality is highly disagreeable But yeah, what I could not verify is that he ever said that the virus is some sort of divine punishment for homosexuality. This website (which I found on Google and have no idea whether or not is reliable) claims to have found the source for this, and that the statement has been corrected to reflect that Liztman never acttually said that: [https://honestreporting.com/hr-prompts-correction-to-false-charge-against-israeli-health-minister/](https://honestreporting.com/hr-prompts-correction-to-false-charge-against-israeli-health-minister/) But again I have no way of confirming that that website in an of itself is reliable.

Well, so that they could recruit students to work for student wages. Which they did. That's right. These poor students spent years studying to help people, and their country screws them over for no reason other than so that it could pay them less to work more in a time of crisis.</TEXT>

The dementor setpiece was cool, but we see it twice within the span of half an hour, and regardless it's not like the dementors were built up quite like, say, the basilisk in the second movie. It has its moments but it's followed immediately by a movie with a much flashier premise that also has way bigger implications on the rest of the series, and then the other movies in the series obviously all have much stronger main plotlines. As a standalone movie, yeah I guess Prisoner of Azkaban is pretty strong, but that kind of comes at the cost of feeling somewhat inconsquential for the rest of the series. It's still good. The lead child actors defnitely got much, much better between movies 2 and 3. But I don't think it's as good as 4 or 8.</TEXT>

If there are too many, people who need treatment badly won't get it, even if it's not for COVID. You know how normally you can walk into a hospital for a medical emergency and expect to get treatment? Not if everyone's too busy looking after COVID patients. In addition, there are generally not enough ventilators to deal with a full-scale outbreak, so that's another reason to minize the virus' spread. The goal of keeping the healthcare system from collapsing like that, is to buy us time until a vaccine is developed.</TEXT>

There wasn't any sort of a shift in power balance, unlike the previous two chapters. Also, I swear Horikoshi has no idea what to do with Present Mic. We see him screaming a lot in this chapter and it does nothing. The fact that the most critical plot point (Miriko trying to break Shiggy's tube) virtually crawled this chapter also didn't help.

    <TEXT>You're technically right, all those things you mentioned did happen. But the chapter did not have a climax nor a plot thread that resolved within it. Admittedly, that's probably really hard to pull off, but it's what makes a weekly release tick- it has to be satisfying to read both in the volume and weekly releases. This chapter may be fine once the volume's done and you read it all at once because it may turn out that it built up the following chapters, but that doesn't mean it wasn't lacking as a weekly release. In contrast, the last few chapters were great weekly releases. Last chapter's end- Tokoyami and Endeavor show up for their respective fights. The chapter before that- Twice died. The chapter before that? Dabi showed up and made it seem like Twice wasn't going to die but Hawks would die instead. This chapter just kinda... ended with pretty much no new developments to set up the next one.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>You're right, this was probably a big part of the chapter's purpose. But I've got a couple of problems with that. 1. We spend way too many panels learning how Endeavor got into the lab. We don't need to know that, he's the freaking no.1 hero, that's justification enough for him to one-shot a preoccupied High End and we didn't really need to see it, let alone over a third of a chapter. 2. Shigaraki got like an entire arc's worth of hype. He was OP as fuck already and as he was he may have been able to defeat all of the heroes present in the lab already. On top of that Ujiko already stressed a while ago that Shiggy will be even more OP once he gets detubed. So really Mirko and co. going spectator mode on him wasn't neccesary. But really the thing that bugs me most is that had you erased this entire chapter we would've lost nearly no plot progression. How did last chapter end? Endeavor arrived and Mirko was mid-kick. How did this chapter end? Mirko just finished that kick and Endeavor barely did anything else. I know people think the female High End may be setting something up, and if they're right that'll be cool, but considering it's extremely obvious the fight in the hospital will end with the heroes winning except not really because Shigaraki will wake up at the end- yeah I don't see how she'll be anything that big.</TEXT>

Anyway by that post's logic I must be as gay as the day is long. Which is fine by me if that means I get to have some cake. I don't even understand that post's logic- yeah if you like sharing the guy can have some of your dessert, but 1. he has no way of knowing whether or not you like sharing 2. if he orders dessert too, then you \*both\* can share and taste two desserts. Been doing that with my gf since day 1 (fortunately she likes sharing. Usually)</TEXT>

    <TEXT>It's rather more like forcing someone to not go into public wearing a bomb. Which as far as I'm concerned is very reasonable. Btw, ironically the biggest issue with anti-vaxxing isn't anti-vaxxers not vaxxing themselves, because most of them already got most of the critically needed vaccinations as children. No, the real problem is their children, who did not get that privilege, and so are both more likely to die due to easily prevetable illnesses and kill others by infecting them. Now, all of this would have been irrelevant had it been true that these people can in fact "deal with their environment" like you said in some other way, and minimize the risks of infection without taking vaccines. It is not true. There is no alternative to vaccines that is as safe for everyone involved.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Hi KHeddit, I played the game a few months ago, had a blast, restarted the game on its NG+-ish thing (because it took me forever to get the Ultimate Keyblade, while at the time there was nothing postgame to use it on, the thing even ripped through Dark Inferno like wet toilet paper). But Idk, I guess the game was too recent for me to enjoy a replay and I stopped playing. So now I want to get back to it. Thing is, I really don't like collecting Lucky Emblems. In light of that, what are the best armor and accessories you can get without having to collect those things?</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Annoyingly this sentiment is fully backed by legislation where I live. Here, rape is defined specifically as forced penetration of the vagina. Now, this wouldn't be too bad and would be mostly semantics if there was some male equivalent to this offense. The closest thing is sodomy (again, not my words, it's just what the offense is called here, roughly translated), which is forced anal penetration, and carries the same penalty as rape. Unfortunately, as you may have noticed, this means that there is no rape equivalent in which a man is forced to penetrate somebody else. The closest we have is probably molestation, which has a considerably shorter maximum sentence than rape. I wonder how it is in other places. Wikipedia says that in America rape is defined as forced penetration of either the vagina, anus or mouth (in the oral instance explicitly by a genital), which would also excluse men being forced to penetrate someone from the definition of rape.</TEXT>

That said, I'm not sure that it's correct to say that the economy and specifically the general well-being of the population are mutually exclusive. Isn't the well-being of people very much tied to the economy? Had the article said the \*health\* of the population then yeah, at this point in time that's not very compatible with the economy. I mean, every country has to make very difficult choices regarding when to let the economy take a hit and when to risk spreading the virus. Making these choices doesn't neccesarily mean a governmen doesn't care about its population, especially since literally anything but a full lockdown is a concession that involves a higher risk of spreading the virus.</TEXT>

Again, this is why it's a complex issue, which requires a delicate balance between virus-related risks and other economic concerns. You can't favor health concerns above else all the time. If you did, you would, almost neccesarily, have to issue a lockdown until a vaccine was found. Anything else is a compromise. Full lockdown for an entire year is a death sentence for virtually any economy in the world.</TEXT>

Until I think 21-ish, a lot of basic stuff would freak me out, cause me to worry, such as having to cook for myself, doing very basic transactions, etc. Mandatory military service fixed that (by forcing me to deal with a lot of shit at the same time). The year I finished it I met my current SO, we've been together for six-ish years now. Had we met earlier she'd probably be shocked at my incompetence. Not that it's entirely fixed. Some of it stuck around as anxiety. Like, if I hear a weird sound around the house, I won't go "huh, wonder what that was" like a sane human being. Instead, I'll worry about it and check everything a million times.</TEXT>

Regarding this part and this part only- yeah I'd be totally on board with that. I met my SO at the age of 21. I had been with a few other women before, but those were pretty lously relationships. About a year into the relationship I realized that it wasn't getting old. Years later it's still a lot of fun. At this point any experience I get that isn't career or video-game related I'd much rather have together with her. The sex is certainly considerably better than it was in those other relationships. YMMV, naturally. The appeal of being with a multitude of women was always lost on me. I'd pass on ever experiencing the awkwardness of encounters with new people in a heartbeat. The moment I started being with women the goal for me was always to find one to stick with.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>That's... you haven't even answered what I just wrote. So assuming you're not trolling- again, I ask you to consider what would happen in the event of a complete lockdown until a vaccine is found, which is the only solution that doesn't try to balance health and economic concerns. Literally any other measure- with no exceptions- is a compromise that involves accepting a higher risk of people getting sick. Most businesses- not just small businesses- let alone people, cannot take such a financial blow. So everyone would be out of jobs, and no one would be hiring. People would be dying on the streets in droves in this scenario. That's not a valid solution if your goal is to protect those people in the first place. You can't separate the economy from lives so clearly in this situation. If you think a full 12-month lockdown is feasible though, I'd love to hear how that might work.</TEXT>

If it was given too late then it probably wasn't lawful. You can't usually terminate a contract at the last minute like that, so near the release window. That's without mentioning the fact that the review scores for Cookstar (what few there are) are in line with scores for other entry in the series, which again makes it questionable that there even were any legitimate concerns about the game's quality.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>90% of the positions you see in porn are terribly uncomfortable. Like, even in doggystyle, sometimes irl you want to lean down to grab her breasts or kiss her back or something, but not in porn, since that doesn't give a good angle to show genitals. Clits get ignored almost entirely in porn, when it's as much the main event as the penis in straight sex in my experience. When it does get any attention I always cringe for the woman because the guy is rubbing it so hard and so fast you'd think he's trying to start a fire. To be fair though, it's the same thing for dicks in porn that contains handjobs. But if you want practical advice, then the biggest thing that porn doesn't feature is- you've gotta say what you like and ask what she likes. That's often enough, but other times you need listen to her body and see how she reacts so you know whether or not you're on the right track. If she's breathing faster that's generally a good tell that you're doing good</TEXT>

Now, while he couldn't have led a new government without breaking promises he made to not be in the same government as the joint arab party, what he ended up doing is breaking another promise by trying to form a government with Bibi almost immedately. So his whole campaign was about overthrowing this corrupt PM, and then Gantz suddenly acts all chummy with said PM. Politics at their worst. The end result is that now Gantz is also identified with supporting corruption.

    <TEXT>Reminds me of how we used to have a law against gay sex in Israel, but only for men. It wasn't once enforced as an independent offence, but when the prosecution wasn't sure it would be able to prove another sex offence happened, then it was included in the list of charges. So for example, if someone was charged with statutory rape, but some parts of that charge were iffy (such as if it wasn't clear whether or not the prosecuted knew that he slept with a minor), then they'd throw in a charge for gay sex to make sure they could get a conviction. Thankfully gay sex was decriminalised in... 1976-ish.</TEXT>

    <DATE>2020-04-26 12:42:05</DATE>
    <TEXT>So I've been hearing some criticism about Ultima Weapon. Namely, I heard that it is a "win button", that it breaks the game's difficulty, even on Critical. I only ever played KH3 on Critical. The game was hard af at first. I wouldn't really know, based on this first playthrough if Ultima broke the game, since I had nothing to use it on, and at level 99 Dark Inferno melts just as readily to the Kingdom Key. But I recently did another playthrough, with Ultima Weapon. Honestly yes, it does make the game significantly easier. It isn't neccesarily a bad thing, since it is quite vindicating to be awarded with this super OP weapon with which to steamroll everything on anothetr playthrough. But yes, that Keyblade makes the game easier. But not to an extreme edgree. Because In Critical, your amazing offense, which is most of what Ultima Weapon nets you, doesn't amount to shit if you get one-shot, which you probably will. And in that regard, what was more relevant than Ultima in my second playthrough was that I decided to get all the lucky emblems as I was doing the disney world rather than all at once at the end of the game (definitely recommended, it makes the game a lot more fun). And that- and not Ultima- was what made the game much easier. Top-tier armor and accessories. What does Ultima net you over the other Keyblades? A couple of extra stat points and the much more significant combo pluses and a busted shotlock. A ribbon as soon as the second Disney world, on top of a Star Charm, are way way way more significant in my experience. But that's not even a fair comparison. If you want to compare the best endgame keyblade to anything, you're gonna have to compare it to a full set of top tier accesories and armor. Which... it's not even a contest. Tl;dr in my garbage opinion, acessories and armor put Ultima Weapon's ability to break the game to shame.</TEXT>

    <TITLE>Just beat Yozora, so here's my garbage opinion on KH3's superbosses</TITLE>
    <DATE>2020-05-02 13:07:40</DATE>
    <TEXT>Holy shit what a ride. I remember googling before buying the DLC which game had the harder superbosses- KH2 or KH3. Almost everybody said 3. And yeah. It isn't even a little bit of a contest. I don't know that that's 100% a good thing- people who got the DLC expecting a challenge got their money's worth, but we should remember that those bosses come at the end of possibly the otherwise easiest mainline Kingdom Hearts Game. So, if you didn't know what you were getting into and got the DLC, I don't know that you'd be able to see the final cutscene, using the same skills that got you through the rest of the game. Anyway. The data battles were pretty amazingly well done. There was this mild issue in KH2, in which the data battles were really just beefed up versions of battles you already won. Not so with KH3. These data bosses all have entirely new movesets... on top of hitting like a truck full of Keyblades. The one issue with this is that, since I was playing on Critical, it was kind of hard to make every attempt into a positive learning experience. Since you can kiss your entire HP bar goodbye after a single combo (sometimes even single hits), some bosses' attack patterns got a bit frustrating to learn. But I guess I made my own bed by playing on Critical in the first place, so okay, no biggie. And maybe the fact that I had to save a lot of my munny to buy elixirs against Yozora specifically, and did not have munny to stock up on elixirs against everybody else, also made things a bit harder for me. One thing I really really liked was how Links suddenly seemed balanced. Okay, yeah, I admit to using them to bypass a couple of data fights' DMs (namely Saix and Ansem's, as well as one part of Yozora's). But they're suddenly so risky. Yes, if you get lucky, you could just sit back on Simba for the entirely of the worst of a boss' attacks. But you'd almost certainly be at 1 HP when the summon goes away, and since you have no way of knowing what the boss is going to be doing at that point, there's a pretty fat chance that it'll kill you the instant the summon's done. That's in contrast to cure, which finishes very quickly and has way more controllable I-frames. And because of this, links weren't win buttons anymore- when they were useful, they were lifesavers, but otherwise and most of the time they took a back seat. Xemnas was probably my favorite data fight. Not only were his attacks and openings extremely fair, but his DM is so incredibly cathartic to avoid. Xion was also great. The entire fight is incredibly tense, and it forces you to utilize formchanges to reset your maximum HP, which you never had to do anywhere else. Dark Riku was also really cool, although I admit to having no idea how to avoid his DM and I survived it by pure luck. Marluxia is a lot of fun too, for pretty much the same reasons as Xemnas. Larxene is the only truly meh data fight. I'm also not a fan of Master Xehanort, but that's mostly because there's a lot going on in that fight and I nevery bothered to learn everything properly (also the freeze effect is bullshit). Of all 13, the only one I actually actively dislike is Vanitas. You know why. His fucking DM. I can avoid everything Yozora does semi-comfortably, but Vanitas' DM goes on for way too long and is too quick for me to react to the whole thing. The fact that he sits at the middle of the stage also sucks. That's in sharp contrast to the rest of the fight, which after countless attempts I could do in my sleep. I know you can technically avoid his DM entirely, but I never managed to do that. And then there's Yozora. Because you absolutely \*need\* to know how to react to everything he does to stand even a remote chance of beating him, I feel like I have a better chance of beating him than I do of beating, say, Master Xehanort or Xion. You can beat a lot of org data battles with some skill and some luck. Luck does not factor into the Yozora fight at all- except in that he can do his DM right off the bat in which case you're extra special screwed, but that only happened to me once. Yozora makes Lingering Will look like Darkside in both difficulty and design. The hype is real. You know what isn't so great, though? The rewards you get for beating these bosses. The weights are completely useless, only a handful or data battles give you stat boosts, and even Xion and Master Xehanort's rewards don't really hold up to stuff you already have (simply because they don't have MP Hastega). Crtystal Regalia + is cool... except just like the original Crystal Regalia when the game first came out, there's nothing to use it on. So that's it. I had a really good time with this DLC. Here's to hoping we can expect something this good when KH4 comes out in 2040.</TEXT>

But if you look at other games in similar situations, KH really isn't doing a good job in comparison. I never played a Witcher game before 3, and the plot was still my favorite part of that game. Similar story for God of War (the new one). There are a lot of examples, and sadly Kingdom Hearts is uniquely challenging to jump into. I love the Kingdom Hearts plot, never played any of the non-numbered titles, only watched their stories on Youtube, and still love the shit out of KH3. But even I can see that, from a marketing perspective, making a story this convoluted isn't the best idea. ...Is what I'd normally say but KH3 sold crazy well so what do I know.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I definitely agree on the inconsistent rules part. I don't remember the name, but I watched this video on Youtube that complained about how some attacks in KH3 are unblockable, while the rules that that is the case aren't consistent, which is in contrast to Sekiro, in which unblockable attacks always have clear indicators in the form of glowing red letters. Limit Cut changes the indications that attacks are unblockable between fights, and I have no idea why. They could have just had all unblockable attacks be red. But for some reason, Xion's are yellow, Xehanort's come in a variety of colors, Saix's too, and Yozora's are blue. And those are just the ones I can remember.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>For one thing, any other legal rights given are given at birth. For another- as I've already written- while in the womb, the fetus is entirely dependent on and parasitic towards its mother. Not only does it not even resemble human beings in any meaningful fashion until relatively late stages of pregnancy, but forcing mothers to keep fetuses they do not want also has heavy (and sometimes lethal) tolls on them. You're wrong, btw, it is also a question of where they are. If at some point in the future we gain technology that allows fetuses to be raised outside of mothers' bodies, then the conflict between the fetus and mother's interests would stop existing, and abortions may stop being moral. But we're not there yet. So right now, not-yet-human's right to exist loses to a human's right to bodily autonomy. You haven't yet answered what in your opinion makes conception the moment in which humans are created, and what distinguishes that moment from the moment in which eggs or sperm, which also have the potential to become human, are created. Btw, what in your view should be done with multiple frozen fertilised eggs that couples that try to conceive store? AKA: couples that can't easily conceive often freeze fertilised eggs as a part of fertility treatments. If, as per your view, humans come into existence at the moment of fertilisation, the mother would be forced to carry each and every one of these eggs.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>There's absolutely nothing wrong with your experience nor with how you want to be treated. Howver, that's not the default procedure for sexual encounters, so you should definitely bring it up with your guy and tell him what you'd like him to do. Again, that's not because there's anything wrong with it, it's more for you two to align your expectations. As a suggestion, how would you feel about him trying out oral on you? It's easy enough in that it doesn't actually require much penetration to get off. I think most women don't need two to three fingers since most of the work there is done on the clitoris. So I think it could help in reducing your anxiety with other vaginal activity. I almost forgot to answer your question about how I would react. It'd be fine by me. I won't lie and say that vaginal sex isn't the main event for me. It definitely is. But so long as other stuff would happen while building towards it, there'd be no problem.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>It's an entirely different feeling. I recycle this next bit whenever this question gets asked here, but anyway, let's say that broadly as a guy you get four main sensations from a vagina: texture, warmth, wetness, tightness. With a condom on, you don't feel any texture at all, you get some warmth but it's heavily muted, and you only feel wetness indirectly. So tightness is the only thing you get. Which is still great, but no it does not compare to the full package you get with raw sex. That's without getting into other stuff that arguably as important, such as that latex smells bad, or how close raw sex makes you feel to the other person, etc. That said, I do disagree about not being able to go back. My gf and I went from condoms to raw to back to condoms to back to raw. It was fine. Once it was clear that using condoms again was the only safe option for us I could set my expectations according to our reality at the time, and that was that. I was still stoked that when we could ditch condoms again a year and a half later, but it's not like I prefered masturbating over sex during that time window or anything. In fact, I still prefered PiV with a condom over, say, oral at that time, so really my de-facto preferences were entirely unchanged.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Agreed on all points. That said, what I liked about KH3's superbosses was how they forced you to learn their patterns, exactly because the rules were inconsistent. That's a separate skill compared with reaction times, which other games, like DMC and Sekiro focus on. Those games have very consistent rules, but as a result you don't really need to memorize everything their bosses do. I don't remember any of the Demon of Hatred's attacks, because for the most part none of his moves required me to come up with special countermeasures. Some data fights had frustrating parts. But overall I got a lot of satisfaction out of mastering each boss as if I was mastering a new game.</TEXT>

We shouldn't be so dismissive of them. So while his reactions don't mean you're disgusting, it means he doesn't like participating in this particular act. But this does mean that he's rather selfish if he cums in you, while knowing he has this preference, before getting you off, because at that point the main ways of getting you off would involve interacting with his cum. So this is the situation as I see it: he doesn't like interacting with his own cum and shouldn't have to. But in that case, he should make sure to get you off before he's done.</TEXT>

Top-tier accessories and armor are more important (Ribbon, Royal Ribbon, Flanniversary Badge, Crystal Regalia, Mickey Clasp).

    <TEXT> gt;I also think a ton of plotlines would be cut way too promptly if Shiggy breaks society during this arc An abrupt and cataclysmic event would interefere with ongoing character arcs? Imagine that! Seriously though, that's the appeal of the theory in my eyes. An altered status quo with the story changing dramatically would be very interesting. I want to see these characters dealing with a vastly different reality to the one they were born into. And I disagree that anything would be lost by such a change. The series would be different, not worse. And it's not like I don't understand you perspective. I used to be a Marvel fan, but was driven away by an endless torrent of status quo changes, to the point that no character arcs could possibly even take place. But that's not the case for MHA, which has been building itself for years now. That's exactly the sort of foundation you need to make a status quo change impactful in the first place. It could be powerful \*because\* it would be uprooting a lot of stuff.</TEXT>

Reddit has the weirdest boner for Sweden these days. Even if they had gone for herd immunity people would've found some way of defending that. Even in an article in which the Swedish government acknowledged its failure in defending vulnerable populations from the virus, 90% of the comments were like "oh, they're admitting their failure, how honest of them".</TEXT>

There were certainly many more women in my university class. Sadly sexism is still extremely apparent, since while you see many female lawyers, you don't see nearly as good a representation at the associate level. So, at the office I interned at, over half the lawyers were women, but out of, say, eight associates, there were only two women. As a hard + slightly dangerous combo, almost all social workers are women. Hard because you see a lot of tough shit for very bad money, dangerous because occasionally people will try to threaten you or, more rarely, attack you. I know this because my parents are social workers.</TEXT>

I don't think that them *owning* the thing was ever on the table. And that's true for this bid too. Edit: in case anybody's curious- we can't see the contract with this particular bid's winner yet, but you can see the one made with the winner of a previous bid to make a very similar facility.

    <TEXT>I'm rather more worried about what a retaliation by our current government would look like in the event of another war. Consider Israel's responses to Hamas hostility in the past decade. Now imagine what would happen if you added into the mix the fact that in the event you mentioned, Israel would be up against a country, and not an organization that can be said to be holding a lot of civilians hostage, as well as the fact that the Israeli government would be able to use the war breaking as an excuse to not accept another ceasefire. Maybe I'm fearmongering, but I think that in that event, Bibi and his similarly right-wing lackeys would take the opportunity to utterly destroy Palestine. I'm in favor of a two state solution myself, but people who like to pretend that "free Palestine" is a mic drop statement usually don't consider how that might actually happen or what else might happen if it did.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I had never gotten into a real relationship before meeting my SO. I had a few short term gfs, but nothing serious. Honestly, my mental image of what my potential girlfriend would look like was exactly what you'd think an unhealthy, objectified woman might be like for a shut in nerd. I can only remember imagining a body, never a personality. What happened was, an old friend started sending increasingly obvious signals that she was interested. I only picked up on them about a year later (because of course I did, right?). So I went for it. Six years later and we live together. Idk what changed. Maybe it was growing out of the teenage "angry at everything, including women" phase (thankfully, we only got together after I got out of my- prepare to cringe- gamergate phase). Maybe, because she was also a friend, I couldn't impose my previously existing assumption of shallowness and was better able to see her as a person. Maybe, as I got more confident by starting to work towards a degree, I got less bitter. It definitely had something to do with her being super patient, and understanding. And open, too- had she not been so willing to share her feelings, I think I'd still had hangups over mine. Honestly, reading this, the tl;dr is probably: stopped being a teenager, got less sexist, and the person I got together with is perfect for me.</TEXT>

Just wanted to point out that you could have said exactly the same thing in a civil manner. I also disagree that it has \*nothing\* to do with culture. Because you can see suspicion by Americans towards their government waaaay earlier than modern times. Now, the background for that country's founding makes it completely understandable that the default would be suspicion, rather than trust, towards the government. So while yes, I agree that a horrific track record has more than a bit to do with it, I wouldn't say that it's not a cultural thing.

Turns out that deciding to protect kids' health by exposing them to a deadly virus may not have been a great idea. Who the fuck knew. Edit: Idk why I specified schools. Masks became optional for everyone during the heat wave now that I think about it. Which was just an incredibly stupid move. I know it was hot. I was here too. But I don't think that risking a second outbreak was worth it, and to me it looks like making masks voluntary during the heat wave may have been a result of a rush of optimism due to the drop in infection rates.</TEXT>

The surface doesn't get indestructible or immovable. So cementoss would be able to move cement surfaces, balls included. I actually didn't know that about Aizawa's quirk, thanks. I still don't think mineta would be able to hit him though.</TEXT>

The shitty(er) part is that foreign countries that do gay weddings are considerably further than Cyprus so the whole thing is much more expensive for gay couples. Adoption though... that's the real shitshow. There are countless kids waiting for adoption and yet it will take forever for them to be adopted by a same-sex couple, if it happens at all. Surrogacy is somehow even worse, since the Supreme Court ruled just a couple of months ago that gay couples should have the same surrogacy rights as hetero couples... And then it gave the knesset a year to amend the law accordingly.

He never used the zodiacs, and the spiders' plot didn't have to be tied to this whole other plot about the mu continent, and was far more interesting to boot. All this while we all know that Togashi may never finish such a long arc. Unless he cuts it short like he did with Yu Yu Hakusho's final arc. Which sucked and had many of the symptoms the current hxh arc is showing: huge plot that, since it happens when Togashi is already out of steam, will probably never be fully realized.</TEXT>

I remember watching a video a few years ago of a police officer arresting a suspect's lawyer who was trying to... you know... represent her client. The charge? "Obstruction of Justice". And... what is that? What even is that shit? Surely it couldn't let someone arrest a fucking lawyer with impunity. And some research later I was left terrified that such a law would exist, since it gives police officers nearly arbitrary authority to arrest people. And nobody cares. People somehow go "muh freedom" over the right to own fucking automatic weapons but not this? How?</TEXT>

If he could, then flyers would be as screwed against him as everybody else, as his decay would just spread through the air. Finally, this is the first time I'm actually rooting for Bakugo. Up until now when people would shout "WHO IS HE?!" Or that "HE'S BEEN REDEEMED" I'd wonder what the hell they were talking about, since he was still extremely offensive, had shown no regret about how he treated Deku, and generally it still looked like he was going to get someone killed because he was being extremely unproffessional.

So now they can protest, and the government can go ahead and do it anyway.

    <TEXT>Look at your comment history. When challenged, you get pretty defensive before lashing out. That doesn't tell me you'd want to consider positions other than your own (which maybe means you shouldn't ask other people to do it, stones and glass houses and all that). And, again, yes, some opinions deserve nothing but dismissal. Round earthers, climate deniers, and bigots all fall under that category for me. You may want to explain why they should be dismissed, but that's it, which means that the people with these opinions do not add anything and just up wasting everyone's time.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>She was a good leader who made a mistake that was exaggerated by nearly everyone around her making very similar mistakes. She also made it at a stage in Israel's history in which it was still vulnerable. I don't think with any certainty that any of our later leaders wouldn't have acted similarly in her position. (Side rant) It also kinda sucks that because of sexism her failures are now held against other female PM candidates. I've heard way too many people say that voting for Zipi Livni was bad (when it relevant) because of the Yom Kippur War.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Mirena is pretty neat since it not only prevents pregnancies but also stops you from having periods. But the hormone dosage, while way less than what the pills give, can still be problematic if you're sensitive to that. Ovarian cysts are a common side effect. If that worries you, get a kyleena instead. IUDs last five years but you should have them replaced every four years. That's assuming you've got an exclusive partner. Otherwise, hormonal bc's are only good on top of condoms, since they do not protect against STDs. Always use condoms if you're not exclusive or if you think your partner might not be clean.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Observable fact? Sure the ICC won't nuke the US. But they can use other, namely economic, sanctions. They can also arrest the relevant people (soldiers), if identified, the moment they set foot outside the US. The ICC, like the UN, simply is not meant to take military action. But it is meant to punish military action. The US violated Afghanistan's sovereignty. The ICC would be fully within its rights to punish the US for that, as well as fir the war crimes the US committed there. It's hilarious that you bring up the ICC not going in guns blazing as a point against it right after you mention the US' Supreme Court favourably. Because guess what? The Supreme Court can't declare war either. So clearly your "might is right" idea is applied very selectively by you.</TEXT>

They (the boars) were always a problem, but like in other places the virus made them get more ballsy recently.

Even then, Aang nearly lost the astral tug of war thing, and had he lost the earth kingdom would have been literally toast. In the grand scheme of things trying to seal Ozai's bending was pretty irresponsible (especially since Aang was in the Avatar State when he used it, so he wagered not only his own life but the entire Avatar cycle).

Shas insists on the status quo, much to the detriment of LGBTQ. That's not a coincdence, and any government that forms with them accepts that. Hell, even before that- the Avoda ruled for decades and did nothing to change to status quo.

It's a weird "change" regardless, since publicly known ( #1497; #1491; #1493; #1506; #1497; #1501;  #1489; #1510; #1497; #1489; #1493; #1512;) couples, gay or not, are formally already entitled to the same rights as married couples anyway. So this seems like a PR move by the Tel-Aviv municipality more than anything. Gay couples can already register as married in Israel, and could since 2006. They still can't marry in here, though.</TEXT>

It's just that the rest of the soundtrack was also great IMO.</TEXT>

And his defenders will certainly say- "well, it gave us a government for the corona crisis." Mhm. So, we all know there's no way in hell Bibi will actually honor the coalition agreement and step down, right? So unless a vaccine is found before that happens, guess what's gonna happen? Bibi will dissolve the government. We still won't have a government for the corona crisis, only this time it'll be during the winter, which is expected to make it even worse.</TEXT>

If they're just going to restore restrictions every time an outbreak happens, then they honestly might as well put us all on lockdown until a vaccine is available. The root of the problem- the thing that has to change so that we won't need more restricitons- is that people are fucking morons who don't give a shit about putting on masks and avoiding hugs. And a lockdown- demonstrably, evidently- does not change that (because apparently people also don't care about being broke). Give more fines. Give bigger fines. Make people listen.</TEXT>

They just don't want to do it anymore, which is extremely understandable, and quite frankly the Cell Saga is an excellent note to end the series on. And burnout takes a while to shake off. It might never go away. If it does, I would not expect that to happen for at least a decade, by which point I fully expect TFS to dissolve and its members to find jobs at other companies.</TEXT>

Cancel your old reservation, have it up north. Gym? I guarantee that even if it was a two hour drive, some people would still go tp whatever places would still be open. But I do agree that politicians are just completely disconnected from reality. Hanegbi's statement made that crystal clear (in case it wasn't clear already, in regard to the most bloated government in history, that is currently in the middle of increasing its own salary, that's led by a PM who hasn't had to pay any of his own living expenses in a decade).</TEXT>

We are currently in the beginning of a second outbreak, so it doesn't look like flights will resume until September at the earliest. If they don't, then they probably won't resume at all until spring since another, worse outbreak is expected during the colder seasons. So that's a pretty small margin of error you can hope for there. If you wait until spring though, then you could pretty feasibly hope for a vaccine by the time you go. So that sounds like the better option to me.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>So already, based on your not understanding what gyms and people not going homeless have to do with each other, it is clear you have no idea what you're talking about. "Facts" 1-4? Require data backing to be proven. You'd think if they were so easy to prove in regard to gyms specifically, the ministry of health would have plenty of data lying around to help it build its case. Fact is, it did not. So under these circumstances- would you be happy if your representatives voted some specific way just because someone told them to, rather than because it would be for the benefit of the public? Because that's messed up. Oh, and yes, I am extremely evil for asking the ministry of health to do its job by showing up to knesset committees with data. I'm practically an anarchist like that. "Fact" number 5- "can" and "should" are two entirely separate things. The government can, technically, decide to nuke Iran and start WW3. And yet, here we are. If your only defense of a government's actions is that it technically could do what it did, then by default that government is bad for everyone.</TEXT>

This woman with a kid came in, maskless, and asked a staff member something. The staff member responded with "first off, please wear a mask." The Karen's response? "Is THaT aNy wAY tO tAlK tO A CUstoMEr?!" People suck.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>After schools reopened here (Israel) shit hit the fan real quick. We are now in about as deep a shit as we would have been had we not shut the economy down for a month. Correlation and causation are two different things and all that but yeah. Overall, online school seems like the much wiser option, if and as applicable. Edit: RIP my inbox, and of course I had completely forgotten what it was that I said in the first place. Since it's kinda impossible to respond to everyone, here's how schools reopened, to the best of my knowledge: First off- young children (younger than 6 years old) were never required to wear masks. Secondly, as schools reopened, social distancing was officially required, but y'know, kids'll be kids. HOWEVER. In the same week that schools reopened, we had a heat wave across the country. Unfortunately, the government, in a shockingly populist move, decided to make masks voluntary, for everyone, for the heat wave's entire duration. So about a week.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Because the government consistently fails to back its decisions with data. It's hilarious that Yuli Edelstein's retort to the demand to present data was "people who ask for data don't understand what epidemiologic tests mean". Because even if you take his word for it, the implication remains that you can't use those tests to determine which places need to be shut down to fight the virus, which \*still\* means that there's no legitimacy to close them. I also have to wonder- what exactly does he expect people to do in that case? Blindly believe that the government knows what it's doing? Because I'm sorry, but considering that this second outbreak is entirely their fault, I don't think they can ask us for that sort of faith. You can't harm people's rights based on hunches or gut feelings.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>It depends on how badly I needed it. If I was otherwise depressed or had a shit day or had been thinking about it for a while- In all of those cases the rejection may exagerrate whatever negative feelings I already had. Usually though, it isn't a big deal. I just go masturbate and that's that. We've been together long enough that I know she's into me, I know she likes what I do in bed, and I feel the same way about her, so if she says no she's probably simply not in the mood. What really help though, is that we both let the other person know why we don't want sex in a particular instance. Usually it's stuff like tired/not in the mood, sometimes it really is "you pissed me off today". Presumably, we clarify exactly because we both know that if we don't do that, then the other person's gonna pout, both yeah it helps anyway.</TEXT>

Regardless of whether or not the people who die from COVID would have died in a few years anyway, it is not up for debate that saving them is something that health professionals have to try to do (I mean I hear American healthcare is terrible so maybe this shouldn't be taken for granted). This means that hospitals being flooded with patients and running out of both respirators and manpower to handle other patients is the actual problem. The important number is not, and never has been, the death toll- it's the number of sick people. Coincidentally, this means that even the "but why are you not protesting for other health issues?" argument is also not in your favor, since when hospitals are flooded people with those things get screwed even harder. 2. More recently, researcher have found that as many as 50% of people who had COVID suffer from long-lasting symptoms. Multiply that 0.4% of the total US population by the disability benefits that a quarter of those people may be eligible for and you get another big problem. 3. Finally, wearing a mask is just incredibly easy for most people. Why whine about it when it is so easy and painless? Even if we take your argument at face value (which nobody should, but okay), and even if wearing a mask would only extend the life expectancy of, say, 10% of those people by only a few years- why discredit that? Surely another five years of an elderly person's life means more to you than the slight personal discomfort of wearing a face mask in public for a few months to a year?</TEXT>

    <TITLE>This game took a few notes from Naruto</TITLE>
    <DATE>2020-07-30 09:07:18</DATE>
    <TEXT>Hi y'all. Spoilers for the anime/manga Naruto in this post. And also for the end of Horizon Zero Dawn. So, I just finished the game. Gotta say, I loved the plot. Well, not at first. At first I thought it was kinda bland. Then, before doing the Ersa quest, I started doing too many side activities. Then, I did the Frozen Wilds. The story there was... okay. But after finishing it I had assumed that the main story wouldn't be too exciting. Boy was I ever wrong. The unfolding mystery in this game was amazingly well-done. So. About that title. Okay, so Naruto is about a ninja boy who grows up shunned by his village. Because he has this powerful monster trapped inside him. As the story progresses though, said monster becomes less and less of a burden on him, until eventually as he learns to channel its power it becomes quite an advantage, that very few of his peers can match. And by the end of the story, it is revealed that the monster was put there by his dad, who was ninja President. His mom also gave him some distinct hereditary stat boosts. And his dad put said monster into his son in the hope that Naruto would use it to help the world. By the \*very end\* of the story it \*also\* turns out that Naruto is the reincarantion of Ninja Jesus' son. No seriously. Oh and he also gets Ninja Jesus powers because of that. So all of these reveals kinda shoot the story in the foot, or at least its themes. See, Naruto started off as this underdog story. You had this kid who had nothing going on for him overcoming obstacles. In fact, a lot of the story was about how hard work could get you much further than innate talent. So you can probably see how this would clash with all of these revelations that explain to us that the main character pretty much won the genetic lottery even \*before\* he got this super demon trapped in him. And you can probably also see what this has to do with Horizon. Elisabeth Sobek is hyped up to an almost comical degree. Without her, the world would have been destroyed(er) several times over. She also does some of the ol' self-sacrifice, just in case the Jesus thing wasn't clear enough. GAIA, the most advanced super-AI conceivable, who could rebuild the fucking Biosphere, even concludes that, yup, only this lady could stop the world from going down the drain again. So for Alloy's story- the story of a woman who had to grow up as her entire community shunned her, and becomes this hero against all odds, to turns into this genetic destiny thing... Where only she could have had the chance of stopping Hades, not only because of her hard work, but also, and arguably more importantly, because she was a clone of a mega-genius whose genes were the only thing that could even allows for the discovery of how to stop Hades in the first place... Like I said, I like the story but this one nitpick is really bugging me.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Oh hey, goalpost moving. How cute. First you say it's provocation that leads to physical violence, then when called out for how absurd that is you move to rules of assembly. Coincidentally, you're wrong. Just last week we had a case in which police kept protestors in place, even when they tried disassemble. In addition, violent dispersal is the very last tool the police are allowed to use. It is not applicable in every single case of illegal assembly (again in Israel, no idea wtf is going on in the US). And "look and act like anarchists"? What point are you even trying to make? The protests look *like protests*. They look exactly like the cottage cheese protest we had here a few years back. I have no idea what difference you're trying to claim exists here. Well, I do actually, the current protests are about something you don't like, but Idk what point you're trying to make without saying that out loud. But you have revealed your hand here- if the way protestors speak or dress, and not the actions they take, and not even their message, are what justifies police brutality in your eyes, then Idk what to tell you other than that immigrating to China isn't very hard. And yes, I will indeed say that what happened in the US can't happen here. Because our police is accountable for its actions. I will not, however, go along with your attempt to portray the protests, rather than police brutality, as the big thing that Americans should be worried about.</TEXT>

I won't sugarcoat it- awful. three times you wrote about the protests. Not once did you mention the people being shot or, more recently, abducted by the police. That is awful.

    <TEXT>Sure. It is an anti-corruption, pro-democracy protest. It isn't about the COVID situation, exactly, but it has been amplified it. Basically the idea is that the government's poor handling of the crisis can be attributed to its corruption. Naturally, since Bibi is PM, the protest also calls for him to be replaced. If you can speak or read Hebrew, again, all you had to do was Google it. "Sometimes there's no other way"- yeah peaceful protests are no one of those cases. And "many more" have died because of the protests, as opposed to police brutality? Really? Because an article by Fox News puts the former number at 17, as of June: https://www.fox6now.com/news/deadly-unrest-here-are-the-people-who-have-died-amid-george-floyd-protests-across-us Now, I wouldn't trust Fox News to accurately describe the sky as blue, but okay, let's assume that's true; Whereas, over a thousand people die to police violence each year: https://www.theatlantic.com/health/archive/2018/05/the-57375-years-of-life-lost-to-police-violence/559835/ Wanna know how many of these were justified? So do I! But we can't. Since the police is not accountable. And that is- again- what the protests are all about. "No one is being abducted". I strongly urge you to read up on the topic. The people there are being detained, asked to waive their rights, and usually released if they refuse. And their badges usually do not have names on them. And, if you think that police getting doxxed is a thing that happens more than people getting killed because the police acts all willy-nilly since nobody can punish it, then Idk what to tell you but maybe you'd also like to convince me that the sky is pink.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Agreed on all points, I'll just address what I feel I can add to: 1. Every single DMC game either has playable female characters or cool fight scenes featuring them (excluding vanilla DMC4). Hell, I'd very much argue that Lady's cutscenes were the coolest ones in DMC3. DMC5 brings in Trish and Lady, gives them nothing to do, and then gives the main characters power ups that ensure that they will never be able to compare again in any way. It's pretty disappointing. Hell, in Dante's first mission, Trish faces this demon, does a feint with Sparda, then goes to sit somewhere while Dante does all the work. After she says first come first serve on the targets. That's downright out of character for her. 2. I think V's problem is similar to Nero's problem in 4- no new tools are acquired for him throughout the game. Except his moveset is even smaller than DMC4 Nero's so the problem is worse. Promotion tries to fix that by giving you a new moveset, but I barely use it since it eats up DT gauge like crazy. In addition, his familiars are just too fragile for DMD or Hell an Hell. They die in one hit each, and playing V without his familiars is just not fun. That kinda connects to the previous point too- since V's familiars are invulenrable during DT, you're even further discouraged from using Promotion since you want to have as much DT time as possible in those higher difficulties. 3. The game is absolutely extremely beginner friendly, gameplay-wise. I feel this is especially true for Dante. I fucking hated playing as him in DMC4. All of his moves required too much precision. As a case in point- Royal Guard was extremely impractical unless you had godly reflexes. Also, I don't know why but his attacks were extremely unsatisfying. DMC5 fixes this. I actually like using RG now, and I enjoy all Dante's weapons in this game. 4. The Qliphoth did get old pretty quickly... Nero's line in mission 2 was on point. It's a shame too, because the city levels are gorgeous and packed with incredible detail. It's a double shame because in mission8, you can kind of see what they could have done with the Qliphoth levels instead. In that mission, you see buildings lodged in the Qliphoth. That could have been cool to see: Imagine if you saw more jumbled buildings stuck higher up the tree. Kind of like the Kiln of the First Flame in DS3, really.</TEXT>

Cavaliere R is the only item that I find to be downright insulting though. Because it is strictly superior to the regular version. The regular version's hyper armor is actually a downside, since on higher difficulties taking multiple hits rather than just one as the hyper armor forcer you to finish attacking can kill you, easily. So losing that in favor of a new move is highly desirable, and I bet the devs knew that, and that's why Cavalier R exists...</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Why should respect come into this? I'm not Norwegian, but my parents were always fine with me having sex with my partner at their house. Coincidentally, you cannot stop teenagers from having sex. This is why abstinence education is always doomed to fail. So regardless of whether or not they are 100% ready for the possible responsibilities that may come from having sex, fact is, they're going to do it. Since this is the case, why force them to have sex in other places, where it may not be safe? On top of that, if the emphasis of your sex ed is "don't do it", then that's wasted time that you could have spent on educating your kids on contraceptives, which would have made them less likely to have babies.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>That is quite a toxic attitude towards sex. Somebody else here pointed out that conservatives like to emphasize the harmful aspects of sex, but not the positive ones (AKA the reasons people a actually do it). You're comparing sex, which should always be a positive experience, to something that can only ever be painful. Ask yourself why that is. Moreover, the comparison does not work. Young people will always find ways to have sex. This is why you can see huge pregnancy rates in abstinence-only schools. Conversely, someone who puts their hand on hot stove probably won't do it again.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Every single one of the female characters who contributed in this arc have been overshadowed by one or more male characters, even within their individual locations. Mirko's scene was awesome and even inspiring. But all of the High Ends she fought came back and taken on by someone else and even shattering Shiggy's capsule ended up being done by someone else. So sadly her scenes kinda feel like tokenism. And it breaks my heart to say this because they really did appear promising at first. Momo's contribution is really cool though. Mt.Lady's... not so much. She just slowed Gigantomachia a little bit. And the attention both of these characters got is almost negligible compared with the attention given to, say, Hawks or even Tokoyami and now Kirishima. It is undeniably true that the series has gotten better at female representation. But it is still very bad at it.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Uh. No, it won't be. By definition, human trial is something that's done *before* a vaccine is approved. You cannot say that the population at large will serve that same function, because that would be missing the entire purpose of third phase human trials: to see whether or not there are any major side effects that show up after a lengthier period of time in many more people. If you use the entire population for this then you risk everyone, not just a few tens of thousand of people, being worse off in the case that there *are* major side effects. Moreover, if you *do* wait to see how the vaccine affects russia over the period of time third phase human trials would have required, then you may as well buy the vaccine of companies/countries that are doing third phase human trials right now, which will probably be finished by then. There are dozens of vaccines that are in the middle of third phase human trials right now. All of which is rendered moot because Russia is completely unreliable and would probably just lie rather than admit that their vaccine *does* turn out to have major side effects. So you cannot trust them to conduct human trials in the first place. This is why I say this vaccine cannot possibly be valid. It is literally not up to any modern medicine standard.</TEXT>

There are a few such parents who took part in that discussion. The views expressed by them do not support the idea that it really is their childrens' wellbeing that's being considered. Rather, it seems to be a matter of control. A controlling parent will absolutely take steps to punish their child for slipping from their control, even if these steps are not to the child's benefit.</TEXT>

    <TITLE>So how well did this game sell?</TITLE>
    <DATE>2020-08-12 17:07:34</DATE>
    <TEXT>Edit: fucking hell I forgot to specify that I'm asking about DMC5. So when I read the game's sales figures, they seemed slightly lackluster for a AAA title. And while the series certainly was always slightly more niche than other AAA franchises, that still seemed a bit worrying. Worrying because when DMC4 underperformed we ended up with DmC. I think capcom has wizened up since then, but still, low sales could mean the series would be put on ice again. Anyway the numbers that struck me as worrisome were that the game had sold two million copies within two weeks. That already means it sold better than DMC4, which seems to have reached that milestone within a month, rather than two weeks, of its release. Still, the numbers are comparable. And yeah, I know, the numbers on both of these games should be enviable to any sane person, but AAA companies are greedy AF so applying reasonable standards to them isn't exactly possible. However, DMC4 ended up selling three million units by the end of 2014. DMC5 sold 3.5 million units... as of March of this year. So it seems to have done much better than DMC4. Moreover, unlike with DMC4, Capcom used a pre-existing engine for DMC5, which I have to assume helped cut development costs. And yes, Capcom did say that the game's sales has exceeded their expectations. But it's kind of hard to tell how much stock we should put into that statement. For all I know it could've just been lip service to appease angry shareholders. So what do you guys thinks? How well did the game do? Am I missing something? Because it seems to me like the game did well, if not phoenomenally so.</TEXT>

    <TEXT> gt; A politician acting within the law to further his political agenda? WOW shocking. The fact you don't see anything wrong with this is an indictment of how messed up we are as a country.  gt; But you're not harping about their power plays during Coronavirus Oh boy, whataboutism, what a complete an utter shock/s. Yeah. I'm not talking about B amp;W. Because the conversation was specifically about a dumb and populist publication by Edelstein, genius. So anyway. You obviously don't understand how law actually works, so I'll try to explain it to you (because I'm a moron who likes to explain stuff to people who obviously aren't going to listen). Every public authority has certain powers given to it by law. The general outline of these powers are explicity written in the relevant laws. This, however, does not mean that these powers can be exercised arbitrarily. Can you imagine if they could be? So here's what actually happened. Yuli Edelstein knows that if he is removed as the Knesset's chairman, there will be a chance that B amp;W will work to legislate against an indicted PM's continued rule. At the same time, the Knesset was already expected to begin working on emergency laws to stop COVID. He says fuck it, and fuck that, and shuts down the Knesset. He does this despite the fact that the Knesset's legal advisor told him that this would be illegal. Because again, and as anybody who knows even a little bit about public law would be able to tell you, even if a certain law says a certain figure can do a certain thing, they do not get to do said thing arbitrarily. In this case, not only was there a need to have the Knesset work ASAP to fight COVID, but the chairman was holding onto his seat, even though he was merely an interim chairman with limited powers who was no longer representative of the public's wishes. It is quite shocking that some people think that public figures should be allowed to do whatever they want so long as they have even the most flimsy of legal justification.  gt; You must be speaking of the judges that ruled against the law, to push their political agenda, undermining the very foundation of democracy. Ah yes. The judges acted against democracy. By... by telling a guy who held onto his seat despite no longer representing any kind of democratic majority to stop shutting down the legislative branch...? Really? Is this seriously your take on this?  gt; It's simple and clear And in no way encompasses all the considerations that go into account when exercising the powers written in that law. Because that is not how laws work. It never was. If that was the case, you wouldn't need courts, and the country would be led by an authoritarian regime that would be able to do whatever it wants. For all my criticisms of this country, I cannot say that we are quite that fucked up... yet</TEXT>

    <TEXT>You're making it sound as if that's either likely or easy. For one thing, Bibi doesn't have all the time in the world to do that. He could get, at most, two appeals, which if he does (and the second appeal may be denied entirely) would give him something like five-ish years to work with, feasibly even less. So within that timeframe he has to get a coalition that will agree that do something that none of his coalition partners have agreed to do so far. On top of that, any special immunity law would need to be protected from supreme court intervention (since it would be very obviously unconstitutional). This means it would also require a special majority. None of that is likely to happen. Is it possible that the right-wing bloc would abandon all its "principles" out of fear of the post-Bibi political landscape? Sure. But it hasn't done so in the last handful of election rounds, so I don't see it happening now.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I am just not feeling this fight at all. It pales in comparison to the Machia fight, or especially the Mirko fight. Both of these seemed at once more creative and more desparate, and moved along at a faster pace. I mean, in this fight, all the combatants are using their Quirks in the most basic cookie-cutter way I can think of. And it's like... we've seen these characters used creatively. Endeavor vs High End for example was way more exciting and we got to see Endeavor using his power in much cooler ways. It fails especially hard compared with the Machia fight for that same reason. The pacing is also kinda bad. We've spent a while on "the heroes try to beat Tomura before his Quirk comes back" part of this fight. Even though we all know for a near certainty that he'll make it out of this just fine. There's also no real shift in power here. Compare this with, say, the Mirko fight, where she would get some good hits in, get closer to Tomura, then get stuck again, take some hits herself, and so on. The fact that Hori needed Tomura to say "oh man I am getting tired here" is actually pretty bad. It is such an artificial way of creating tension that he might as well have put an HP bar on top of his head. It's just kind of boring. We spent so long getting hyped up over what would happen when Tomura emerged and how strong he would be. And then when he does come out he's kinda... meh. Like yeah any other villain would have been obliterated in this situation, but he's not any other villain. He's the guy who destroyed a city before he got the biggest power up in the entire series (after he beat the previous record for the biggest power up in the series... which he also held).</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I kinda think it's gonna hit Aizawa... For one thing because if Shigaraki is in a position to hit one of them, he might as well get the actual source of the problem before he pops back in to bother him later. For another, because Aizawa is so good at HtH combat anyway that while losing his Quirk would be a huge deal, it wouldn't stop him from participating in the story afterwards.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Starting Solars can do some insane things, such as balancing themselves on leaves in a hurricane, with two or three Charms. But that's a significant portion of their Charm selection. They can't do too many of these feats right out the gate. Each of these feats are also composed of several mini-insane feats. So again with the Athletics example, a component of that feat would be being able to stand on any surface, no matter how thin or fragile. Impressive- but not that crazy in the grand scheme of things. Chejop Kejak can kick Creation. All of it. And everyone in it. And that wouldn't even represent a fraction of just his combat Charms' prowess. That's what you could expect from a First Age Celestial. There was this old example of high-level combat featuring the Invincible Sword Princess, an Essence 5 Solar, going up against a bunch of elder Dragon-Blooded. They start off by shooting her with a certain-kill doomsday cannon. She perfect defends against it. The entire tower she was at explodes, but she is completely unharmed. She then immediately summons her Daiklave and goes Super Saiyan, activating a silly amount of stat boosting Charms. Then she uses \*one\* Awareness Charm to locate the hiding Dragon-Bloods, \*one\* Athletics Charm to immediately close in on them, and then she turns them into an elemental smoothie. This all happens in the span of maybe a handful of seconds. The ISP is an Essence 5 Solar. She is probably not much older than a hundred years old. Not very old for a Solar. Hope this helps.</TEXT>

And if you only include the few events you counted as national events, then you only get a very tiny fraction of infection causes. Why do that?</TEXT>

So even if you did vote for the other guy you still got Bibi. I think our election system is smart and allows for many minorities to be heard in a single government, but it has a big flaw: you can vote for whoever you want, but that party can do whatever it wants with your vote. Even if it promises not to do a certain thing, that's usually not a binding promise and it can just do whatever it wants. And at that point all you can do about it is resolve to vote for someone else next time.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>No majority that would have been possible in recent years could have given that kind of law the degree of permanency needed to make it count. To make a law immutable barring a certain majority, you have to approve it with the same majority required to change it. So if you want a law that can only be changed by 80 Knesset members, you need that many members to support it in the first place. But at most, over the past decade, that kind of law could have gotten 61 members' support. If even that. Which means that any united coalition would have been able to undo it on a whim. I agree that limiting government terms is the solution. But it hasn't really been on the table for a while now.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Not the same guy, but I find DnD 5e to be way, way, way lighter. There might've been a comparison in 3.5, but 5e? No way. It was a deliberate design decision to make it the lightest edition, which makes it the most playable edition by far. You see similar trends in other games. VtM and VtR got much lighter with recent editions. It's just a modern sensibility/courtesy. Exalted? It just got worse. Action resolution takes inexcusably long. Asking players to remember the rules is a big ask surpassed only by the herculean task that is actually running the game. And all those rules just get in the way. When you make a big action the last thing you want to get is a groan from the table, but because whenever dice are involved the game grinds to a halt, that's what ends up happening. Exalt V Exalt combat should be this climactic, exciting event in the story, but it is the worst offender in that front. Honestly the base system is fine. Decisive/withering is a great little system in and of itself. Stunts are incredible. But Charms overcomplicate things beyond belief. Which sucks since they are everywhere.</TEXT>

Or, you could try Godbound. It has an entire section dedicated to emulating Exalted. Actually emulating everything in the Exalted setting using Godbound is pretty hard, though (if not nearly as hard as doing the same thing with the Exalted rules).</TEXT>

But then the payoff for those things is pretty much the worst. The finale is just inexcusably shallow. Even for a kids' show. They made more or less the worst choices they could have made for that story's final few episodes. Watch seasons 1-4 for the fun character moments then jump ship as soon as Steven returns to earth in Season 5.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Sasuke suddenly not caring about the value of life was just a huge leap. He was strongly adverse to killing up until that point. He avoided killing all the mooks Orochimaru threw at him. He wasn't even going to kill Deidara before he blew himself up. He prefered training under Orochimaru rather than kill Naruto to get the power he needed to fight Itachi. I think the only one he did (try to) kill was Orochimaru, who very much deserved it. So going from that to wanting to do what Pain did to konoha was very unnatural character progression. I'm sure some people would attribute it to the trauma of having fulfilled his quest while also learning that it was unjust, but 1. What you said, if he cared about Itachi then why would he try to destroy what he cared about? 2. Why would he ever even believe Tobi? 3. That is still a complete heel turn prompted by *one* event.</TEXT>

It currently can't, since it's useful at managing and preventing infections from increasing. It isn't effective when infection rates are already out of control. So the idea is to reduce infections down to the 2000 range and then keep is there while reducing it more slowly via the Ramzor plan. That's the idea, anyway, afaik.

    <TEXT>Answering for when I used to run 2e for a couple of friends: 1. 0-3 hours, tops. 2. Virtually all of that prep was about setting up the plot and setpieces of the session. Very little of it was about mechanics. So I would mostly read fluff, write some characters and see what they're likely to do that would also be cool for the players. 3. Extremely. The rules are so cluncky and unwieldy that ignoring them and only referring to them as little as possible was the only way running a game was remotely possible. Which, sure, you can do, I did it, but then why use that particular system at all? 4. I think that this is one of the hardest games to get players involved in. The setting is incredible. It's my favorite setting. But it can be overwhelming to new players. And if the setting can be overwhelming then the rules are downright intimidating. You need to realize that asking players to read and remember not only around a hundred pages of core mechanics, but also cross-reference that with an entire book of errata that is absolutely vital for keeping the game even vaguely functional is a huge ask. And if you're thinking that that's the Storyteller's job, then that is a huge cross to bear because remembering what all the Charms do is very difficult. But if the players don't know the core mechanics well then they won't be able to remember what their Charms do, since Charms build on the core mechanics. I sadly cannot recommend Exalt as a system for a new Storyteller. The system simply does nothing to contribute to the game. You need cheat sheets and extreme familiarity with the system for it to work at all. That's simply not competitive in the modern RPG market, in which the current trend is to steamline games for ease of use.</TEXT>

This is the government telling people to work against their will, at the expense of their own patients and livelihoods.

    <TEXT>So there's this thing called empathy. From the Wikipeia page, it's: **the capacity to understand or feel what another person is experiencing from within their frame of reference, that is, the capacity to place oneself in another's position.** So while I, for example, do not live in the US, and also do not have any American friends or family members, using empathy, I can still understand that 9/11 was a horrific tragedy. I can then use that understanding as a frame of reference for the events that followed, such as the Patriot Act and the Iraq war. The latter of which does affect me since I live in the Middle East. Surely I do not need to also explain to you what valuable lessons were learned from the Holocaust via similar applications of empathy.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I've yet to see a reliable source provide data that the protests are in any way major COVID spreaders. AFAIK it is so far down the list of COVID-relevant activities that that's hardly even an actual concern. But okay, let's assume that they were in fact as likely to get you sick as mass weddings. In that case, the government would need to limit them via emergency legislation (which Mendelblit just said wouldn't be constitutional anyway, but disregarding that). But you can't trust Netanyahu with anything, let alone with limiting the protesting rights of those that oppose him. And this is doubly true when he has failed so utterly and completely in handling this crisis. You said that now is not the time to protest. But right now is the time in which Netanyahu's corruption and incompetence are costing people their actual livelihoods, sometimes their lives even. Right now is the time in which he is most likely to wield his power dangerously, which he already has, and that's how we got where we are with a massive second COVID wave. This is, sadly, exactly the time to protest. Regarding the optics of the situation- do you really think that Bibi supporters will suddenly change their minds just because protesters are protesting now specfically? Really? So many of Bibi's base vote for him out of habit and fear, surely you don't expect them to think about the protesters anything but "traitor leftists" regardless of circumstance.</TEXT>

    <TITLE>Dungeons and Dragons Binders</TITLE>
    <DATE>2020-09-27 11:24:08</DATE>
    <TEXT>Hi everyone, I was wondering how you would model DnD Binders in Fate. **Wtf are we trying to do?** The Binder is a DnD class that can host powerful spirits (called vestiges) to gain supernatural abilities. So, you could bind the vestige of an angry former sun god to gain the ability to breathe fire, see in darkness and gain ram horns for some reason. While a vestige inhabits your body, you may have to manifest its sign, which is some outwardly expression of its presence, coupled with some of its personality. So again with the angry former sun god (called Amon, should've specified that earlier), you would get easily irritated and also grow ram horns. Generally though, you would only need to manifest these signs if you didn't do well on the roll you made to bind the vestige (you bind it anyway, the roll is made to see whether or not you manifest its sign). There's a ton of vestiges, but many of them are limited by the PC's level, and anyway it isn't assumed that the character knows how to summon all of them immediately (discovering new Vestiges should be a very good incentive for a Binder to do stuff). Binding a vestige also requires performing a short ceremony each day. You lose your vestige at some point whenever you sleep at night, so for a brief period between that point and when you resummon it/bind another one in the morning, you are quite vulnerable. You normally only get to perform this ritual once a day, so for the rest of the day you're stuck with whichever Vestige you chose at the beginning of that day. Here's how I would do it: **Aspect**\- have a Binder Aspect, which changes to reflect your bound Vestige. The bound Vestige gives you narrative permission to use your existing skills in whichever ways make sense for it. So again with the example of Amon: first, your Binder Aspect would change into Binder- Hosting Amon, and you would gain the ability to use Shoot to breathe fire, Invoke to gain a bonus to Fight when charging, etc. Since having an aspect that you can change depending on the situation is quite powerful, I'd charge a point of refresh for it as well. I don't think that the weakness in potentially getting stuck without a vestige is enough of a tradeoff to warrant not charging a points of refresh. For one things, because it is super specific, for another, because that would be a compel that would get you a fate point anyway, and finally because it is so glaringly un-fun that it should only happen once in a blue moon. Obviously, this Aspect becomes more powerful the more vestiges are available to the player. So I'd charge a point of refresh for three starting vestiges. If the player wants to have more, charge another point of refresh for another three or so vestiges. If you want, you could define these permission specifically and write them down, similar to how magic Disciplines are defined in Fate High Fantasy Magic [https://fate-srd.com/odds-ends/high-fantasy-magic](https://fate-srd.com/odds-ends/high-fantasy-magic). This could help make sure that no Vestige is too powerful- if you define each one with three to four special narrative permissions, then none of them would be much more broad than the other. The Vestige's Sign could just be represented with compels. If you don't want to deal with a Sign- pay a Fate Point to ignore it for a scene. The issue with tying Sign displays to one roll made at the start of the day is that Signs are interesting, you don't really want to get rid of them, and in Fate you can even be rewarded for playing with them by earning Fate Points. **Stuff I didn't deal with**: 1. Multiple Vestiges- In DnD, powerful Binders get to bind two or even three Vestiges at once. I'm not really sure how to balance that amount of narrative permissions. Sure, if you have three Binder Aspects that would be pricey enough, but that's a hefty price to pay (although playing a character that has become so consumed by his Vestiges that they define them so utterly could be interesting). You could just charge more Refresh, as if you were buying an additional Discipline in Fate High Fantasy Magic. This should probably cost two Refresh since. again, the ability to swap Vestiges is powerful. But then that doesn't represent the Vestige via Compels, which costs roleplaying incentives. 2. Vestige-specific stunts. Imagine this scenario: You like Amon so much that you have a Stunt that says: +2 to Shoot rolls to Create an Advantage-On Fire with fire breath. That Stunt would be completely useless for a whole day if you chose a Vestige other than Amon that day. But if you make the Stunt change depending on the Vestige you have, then it becomes very powerful. Not sure how to handle this. And that's that. The only reason I decided to write this wall of text is because Binders are awesome- it is my favorite class in DnD (seriously, they are great, both flavorful \*and\* not a mechanical mess), but I haven't seen a conversion attempt. Please share your thoughts and criticisms!</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Stunt-swapping is an excellent solution, thanks. Regarding the first part- first off, I loooove empty theorycrafting. But more importantly, my assumption is that players will begin at the equivalent of 10th level or so. Starting Fate characters are considerably more competent than your run of the mill level 1 D amp;D PCs, so it works better this way IMO. The important bit is that, yes, the PCs will be at a level in which double binding would've been possible in D amp;D, but I can just do away with that if there isn't a comfortable solution, you don't *really* need it to make Binders fun to play in Fate.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I honestly don't see much of a reason to deviate from the Fate Core rules at all for this. I'm kinda assuming that you wouldn't be playing one of the Seven. So in that case, just make a character, as usual. The setting's Aspects could be Under Vought's Thumb, and Enamored with Supes. As for how you could portray The Seven/supers in general- Fiction First is king here. Take Homelander for example (because of course we're gonna). All you really need to represent him is one Aspect that would cover all of his powers. It doesn't actually matter what it is since most players will probably be one the same page about what he can do regardless, you can even just call it "Homelander" if you really want to (or "Superman" if you're feeling cheeky). That Aspect alone would give him permission to fly with Athletics, fire laser beams with Shoot and use Notice or Investiage from far away. Then crank all of his relevant skills up to eleven (Superb at the very least). The final touch is that, as you know, normal folks cannot actually touch Homelander, or any of the Seven really, under normal circumstances. To represent this, and again as part of Fiction First, just flat out say that PCs simply \*cannot\* harm Homelander without an appropriately grand Aspect in play, or unless the PCs somehow pit him against another superpowered being (or if one of the PCs is one). That's kind of it. Honestly for Homelander specifically I wouldn't even bother with Stunts since his whole thing is that his skills are through the roof and that he has special narrative permission to use them in supernatural ways, which we already have covered.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I disagree. Fantaicism flies right in the face of everything you wrote, sadly. Many of Bibi's voters are fueled by two things: Fear and a prosecution compex. The former means that they are stuck in a circle of being too afraid of what could happen if somebody ever replaced Bibi to actually every giving someone a chance, so they vote Bibi, and in turn complain that since he's experienced at his job we shouldn't let anyone else have a shot. The latter means that because they feel like they are the underprivileged underclass, they should vote for whoever the left, whom they feel is the privileged upper class, does not want (even though the Bibi voters who actually do struggle remain that way under this rule). Covid changes neither of those things. If poor people who vote Bibi haven't noticed that he doesn't care about helping them over a decade, one year, no matter how bad, isn't likely to make them wake up. Right wingers who vote for him just to stick it to the left are also not going to start voting responsibly. Regarding Gantz specifically- if this government does indeed go up in flames this December, then that will just prove that he was a massive idiot by ever believing a word that comes out of Bibi's mouth. I don't see how that could be a good thing for his odds at winning that round</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Hi guys, Like the title says- I want to do a single job run, having played a 12-job run previously. However, I cannot shake the want to make Baltheir a Machinist and Fran an Archer (and Vaan a Shikari but since that's a not-shitty Job anyway that seems less crucial). I hear Machinists are actually better in single job runs since they don't rely on extra stat increases from other job boards to do damage. Archer is the one that's a bit more worrying. Extra item lores sound like they could maybe make Fran a decent side healer, a role which I really don't want to relegate to a Monk since they get their good magic super late in the game (and even then, in a single-job run they probably won't have the MP pool to support it). So is this an absolutely terrible idea or not? The only secret bosses I really wanna do are the Espers, I'm not a fan of the rest. If this sounds doable to you, what do you think my other jobs should be (I'll be leveling all six characters, btw)? I'm thinking White Mage (obviously), Red Mage and Bushi.</TEXT>

Then, let the PCs swap stunts every session as they normally would be able to via minor milestones as they gain or lose magic items. If the magic item in question is sentient then you don't even need to do that. So long as it has its own agenda, slap an aspect onto it and compel and invoke it however you want.

    <TEXT>I think the points of peripheral motes are a combination of the two things you mentioned: They're meant to be a limited resource, as you noted (and exactly like personal essence in that regard) \*and\* they're supposed to invoke the extra caveat of anima flare. It isn't one or the other. If the fluff description doesn't make sense to you (which it kinda doesn't) then you can make up something else ( such as- yes, it is coming from outside your character, but the essence cost comes from the effort of drawing that external essence, or something). Regarding your issue with Solars, yeah I've bumped into that too while trying to make a Fate conversion. The flat-out superior shtick with Solars is definitely a lot less interesting than the stuff other Exalts get, and it is also prone to forcing you to deal with ballooning numbers, which are better avoided. Idk how to solve this yet, but I once considered giving them the ability to spontaenously invoke Charm effects that they do not have, for an increased cost. This is ripped directly off of Godbound, in which characters can do just that- pay more effort (Godbound Essence) than you usually would to activate a power that you do not own. Your no-tier approach sounds like a great idea. In-setting Dragon-Blooded get to use Celestial circle Sorcery fairly often by some means anyway (Mnemon could do it, Brigit could do it, and the Scarlet Empress definitely could). Same deal with Celestial Martial Arts. That said, I would maybe require suitable fluff justifications for breaching the boundary of your Exaltation. Nothing that would cost you mechanically, just have some justification for doing something that the lore says is exceptional even for an Exalt. Celestials barely require narrative justification for keeping up with Solars, so that's more of a problem for DBs. I think the easiest way to do this is to have DB players in a mixed-Exalt game play several DBs rolled into one stat block. Or just have them play an elder DB, if the party consists of younger Celestials. It's not like overcoming natural aging is a particularly huge deal in Exalted anyhow.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Have a look at how Shapeshifting is handled and see if you could use a similar solution. Straight from the Fate SRD: "You can change your form into that of any creature. You can use Will to create an advantage of Creature Form. The opposition is generally Fair (+2), though it increases for particularly large or small shapes and for complex transformations like a swarm of bees. Your new shape persists until you decide to end it or get taken out." If applied directly to the animating power you're describing, then whenever it's used, the animated figure would be represented as an Aspect with however many free invokes the player scored. The animated being would also have whatever narrative permissions make sense for it. If it has wings it would fly with Athletics, for example. The more fantastic the being (AKA the more it has such unique narrative permissions) the higher the difficulty should be for the Create an Advantage roll. Wanna animate some guy? That's Mediocre because it gives no special narrative permissions. Wanna animated a fire-breathing dragon who can both breathe fire with Shoot and fly with Athletics? That could be Good (or more if it's also a very large dragon). As for the minutae, such as whether or not the created beings should have stress boxes or skills separate from the animator's, have a look at Fate High Fantasy Magic. You'll wanna look at Animated Creatures, as well as the Animator Stunt: [https://fate-srd.com/odds-ends/high-fantasy-magic](https://fate-srd.com/odds-ends/high-fantasy-magic)</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Mechanically it's pretty bland but you need to remember that the mechanics are secondary to ficiton in Fate. For example, okay, Create an Advantage is mechanically not super interesting. But the emphasis there is on describing a dynamic and shifting scene. Saying "roll Athletics to Create an Advantage" sounds boring af. Saying "you bring down the chandelier on top of their heads, making the room "Covered in Glass Shards and Dark" (possibly also On Fire) is more interesting. Kinda the same deal with Challenges. Y'know that scene in Infinity War in which all the characters gang up on Thanos to remove his gauntlet, and each character uses their abilities to somehow contribute?

    <TEXT>...What? What you wrote doesn't answer my question. If trading partners come to the table knowing full well in advance that they cannot trust you, then they will first and foremost look for other partners (the US does not provide many unique goods nowadays other than weapons), and secondly will ask for more assurances. Neither of those things are good for the US. I very much sense an "owning the libs" vibe from you, but if your trade partners consistently feel that they are indeed "getting their asses handed to them", again you're not giving them much of a reason to negotiate with you at all. That's known as \*negative\* leverage. Case in point- the Iran deal. The US went back on its word and is now not a player on that front. And it won't be allowed back because it is notoriously fickle.</TEXT>

Since you can't have the sidekick take independent action alongside the PC (you really can't, Fate handles that rather poorly), I'd say, give the sidekick a few skill points and represent them as an aspect on the PC's character sheet. If the PC wants the sidekick to act in combat, that can happen either via an invocation that represents the sidekick helping somehow, or if the PC uses his action to give the sidekick orders.</TEXT>

I always finish inside her when she has it (and wear condoms when she doesn't) and we're happy and childless campers. I saw a comment here about how finishing inside frequently can give a vagina imbalanced PH levels, but that hasn't happened to us. But look, you don't need to make the leap from condoms to him finishing inside you all at once. You could make it more gradual, such as by having him pull out during no-condom sex for a while first. Maybe once/if you feel safe doing that, go on to having him finish inside.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Bigger numbers aren't all that exciting by themselves. The baseline suggestion for Stunts is that they give at most +4, and that you make those stunts once-per-session affairs or limit them in another manner (remember, stunts are worth two shifts, you can change that if you want but there's no real reason to do so). Another use of stunts is to have them allow you to attack everyone in a zone. Or, more interestingly, tie stunts to narrative permissions. That is, stunts can allow you to do cool stuff you wouldn't normally be able to do, even if (or especially when) numbers wouldn't help in describing them. So, for example, usually you wouldn't be able to attack from a distance with Fight, but with the Stunt Butterfly Beam you would be able to (perhaps by charging the attack via a Create an Advantage roll beforehand). The core book uses attacking with Stealth to emulate sneak attacks. Why stop there? You can punch people in the feelings by having a stunt that lets you roll Fight against Will.</TEXT>

But admittedly that may have something to do with the fact that pride month happens when there's like a million degrees here. But okay, I've seen pictures of people in leather thongs from other pride parades too. But... that isn't any more vulgar than, say, swimsuits, is it? I mean if it's fine to wear speedos and bikinis to the beach then surely most other similar things should be fine as well.

Tbh I was such a giant mess of a teenager that it's kind of a wonder they even let me do what I ended up doing. And that's without even mentioning my health problems. Anyway, the service itself was actually a lot of fun. I learned a lot, gained a ton of super valuable experience. If it wasn't for the army I'd probably be even more of an introvert than I am now, so at least there's that. Anyway I served the usual three years and thought that would be that. You guys, I cannot begin to articulate how deeply I regret having given three years of my life for something that turned out to have been harmful to my career. After finishing my degree, I started looking for an entry-level job in my field. My CV is pretty good. I did a ton of extra stuff while I got my degree. My grades were also good. But around a third of the interviewers I got asked me something along these lines: "Hey, so, your CV is pretty impressive. But your military service seems a bit underwhelming by comparison. What's up with that?" BITCH nobody fucking asked me what I wanted to do in the fucking army. The fuck am I supposed to say to that without botching the interview? And I got those question so. Fucking. Many. Times. I ended up getting a job (it was an internship so it had since ended, now I'm as unemployed as most other people, that's why I'm making this rant, because I know that this shitty experience is gonna repeat itself when I apply for a non-internship job). But I just feel like I've been duped. I used to believe that whatever job you end up in at the army, you can do it well, and be proud of that. But no, turns out you can't. And that's pretty depressing.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>It was recommended by the placement (hoping that that's the right word) project that my university ran. They said that if you don't put it on your CV then that's gonna raise questions and present you in a negative light. Not that I'm sure that it would've made my situation any worse for the aforementioned reasons, but yeah that's what I was told to do</TEXT>

    <TEXT>The issue is that when expulsions are done under these circumstances, you've got more than a few reasons to worry that these people didn't get due process.</TEXT>
