Eventually we block each other and I got lonely and unblocked her I have no idea where she is let alone if she #8217;s even alive still. I hope she got better, ive been thinking about tracking her down and checking in. She really just had a lot of problems that her shitty mom and step dad didn #8217;t want to help until last minute. Damn now I kind of miss her  #128514;</TEXT>

I #8217;m glad we aren #8217;t a thing anymore, but I do feel kinda like a jerk for just completely ghosting her. Sometimes the hardest choices to make are the best choices to make.</TEXT>

    <TITLE>Why are people so fucking stupid</TITLE>
    <DATE>2020-09-24 00:01:15</DATE>
    <TEXT>First off, I #8217;m not a trump supporter per se. I simply support some policies and think he #8217;s done some amount of good for us. I understand he #8217;s a shitty human being, whether that be because he allegedly had sex with minors or the fact he #8217;s cheated on his wives. I don #8217;t like him that much. But why the fuck do people support Biden? He was openly racist in the 80 #8217;s and early 90 #8217;s, he has dementia for sure, and he #8217;s also a fucking pedophile. Not to mention he #8217;s homophobic. I get it people just don #8217;t like trump, but why not vote for another party, it may not make too much of a change but at least your making a choice for someone you actually like, not  #8220;settling #8221; for Biden. And if Biden gets elected and dies, Kamala Harris will become president but she #8217;s probably worse. She #8217;s put so many black people and jail over dumb shit and laughed at the situations, she endorsed riots (not protests, riots) I just don #8217;t understand why people think it #8217;s a good idea to vote for him, if you hate trump that much fine, but you can #8217;t call trump a bad person and a pedophile but be fine with voting for Biden. Honestly fuck all this agenda shit, from all sides, fuck BLM, fuck antifa, fuck FOX, fuck CNN, fuck everything it #8217;s all corrupt and is causing nothing but trouble and giving children false information. I #8217;d be fucking rich if I had a dollar for every time I heard someone say  #8220;I hate Trump #8221; but not give me a reason why at school. I just needed to get that off my chest. You are free to vote for whoever but this shit is driving me insane. These politicians don #8217;t give a fuck about us, they are power and money hungry motherfuckers. They will convince you they are fucking Jesus Christ if it means you #8217;ll vote for them. Sorry for the rant, if you have anything you #8217;d like to say please do, I need some people to talk to.</TEXT>

Again like I said I don #8217;t like him I think he #8217;s a shitty person but people can #8217;t say he #8217;s bad and support Biden. But yeah that #8217;s still fucked up and I took a lot of offense when he mocked the disabled reporter. We need better candidates period.</TEXT>

(One more thing I have anxiety and used to have really bad depression) EDIT: I do see a therapist and she isn #8217;t helping. I #8217;m thinking about trying to get some type of medicine for it. But other than that she doesn #8217;t really help in the long run. My parents are very religious and got a religious therapist, I won #8217;t even get into the problem with that.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>What do you guys think about the presidential debate? Personally I think trump did better but the interruptions were so uncalled for. I #8217;m really disappointed. I expected more from the president. Biden probably didn #8217;t know what was going on and would often just ramble, or use insults. Which is probably worse in a debate than interruption. I don #8217;t know over all we #8217;re fucked either way. I just really don #8217;t want joe to be my fucking president. Fucker will probably die soon anyways, I just feel bad for him tbh.

    <TEXT>Yes they do include religion but that #8217;s pretty much the whole point. If they are elected officials they should be able to have a voice in things, not the final say but still a voice. Trump also isn #8217;t really religious. I grew up with religious family and he is the farthest thing from it, or if he is he has a lot off confessions due at the church. All I #8217;m saying is, let #8217;s give her a chance, we should be tolerant and give everyone a fair chance. Republicans do have strong views on things but rarely does that actually get in the way of normal life, usually it #8217;s the more controversial things that republicans actually care about.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>So this week has been very shitty, and Ive had lots of bad weeks. I don #8217;t even know what to do anymore The son of my moms best friend snitched on me for helping him. I hurt my moms relationship with her My parents found out I #8217;m vaping I have nobody to talk to at all I have been banned from going out on my bike, to the the basketball courts, anywhere really without parental advisory. I have no electronics anymore, besides a TV that doesn #8217;t barely work. I feel so fucking alone and honestly if I didn #8217;t have family and friends I #8217;d kill myself right now. I feel like such a fucking failure, hell I am a failure. Everything I do always comes back to kick me in the face. My parents are fucking angry at me and I mean very angry. Even trying to explain that vaping isn #8217;t harmful in moderation, they believe the media #8217;s bullshit on how horrible it is. (Before you go off on me for vaping, I wanted to cope with stress and I wanted to build up a nicotine tolerance so I wouldn #8217;t be tempted to use cigarettes because a bunch of kids in my group smoke.) I just don #8217;t know what to do, help me. The loneliness is killing me. Edit: I said no electronics which isn #8217;t really true. Sometimes I can use a laptop for Reddit but that #8217;s all that really works and they wanna take that away too. I hate to bitch because other people have it worse but I #8217;m so fucking lonely and I have anxiety and depression along with ADHD so staying in the fucking house all day is probably the worst thing about all this, besides embarrassing my parents. I just wish I could end it already.</TEXT>

They also hate social media, so no chance of even getting that back. I hate having to do shit like go behind there backs and buy secret phones and shit (I did that before) not because I feel wrong but because I #8217;m tired of hurting them and digging a deeper grave every time. They are conservative Christian parents who don #8217;t tolerate shit, I can #8217;t be a normal fucking teenage boy with them. They are abusive as fuck but won #8217;t admit it, they just say  #8220;we love you so much despite what you think #8221; and  #8220;we just want to protect you #8221;.</TEXT>

Edit: I also don #8217;t support it morally myself, because it is a living thing and that #8217;s been proven with science over and over, but I feel like if we could find a way that it wouldn #8217;t feel pain and it wouldn #8217;t damage the uterus I #8217;d 100% support. I just don #8217;t like to think about it, I don #8217;t like to think about innocent beings dying because you couldn #8217;t wear a fucking condom. Still it is your choice, right or not</TEXT>

Kamala Harris isn #8217;t black, which he was right about, she is Indian mixed with something else, but she has no roots to slavery, so claiming she is a black woman is offensive. Saying she isn #8217;t fit for office is just a political jab. Fact is she #8217;s put more black people in jail over dumb shit than trump, her own state didn #8217;t even want her. All the other stuff is debatable but he #8217;s done a lot for the black community. Obama and Biden didn #8217;t even back LGBTQ rights until the second term, and there was a very high black unemployment rate.</TEXT>

The only good feminists I #8217;ve heard or met are the old school women #8217;s rights feminists. Men don #8217;t sing about there dicks, and although we talk about women usually it #8217;s in a consensual manor. We don #8217;t go around in rap lyrics talking about raping women. I don #8217;t care if you like cardi b but it #8217;s not feminism, it #8217;s garbage that enables young children to act like hoes (young as in 11-15) because let #8217;s be honest, how old are the  #8220;feminists #8221; who listen to cardi b #8217;s music?

Shit is the same everyday, and I have nobody to talk to. I #8217;m lucky if I can crash at my cousins place and talk with them, but even with that no matter how many fucking times I try and live a normal life something goes wrong. I feel like nobody is here for me, and my parents claim they #8217;ll always be there for me, but are the ones who give me shit over everything. Then when I snap back and cut my arm because I #8217;m sick of this shit they have the audacity to say  #8220;this isn #8217;t funny #8221; like it was a fucking joke. Then after a few hours and maybe a day or two they wanna act all caring and nice until the next problem. I #8217;m tough, I can handle this shit so far, I #8217;m not in the best mental state but I #8217;m not dead, still, how many more punches to the gut before I go fucking crazy and do some shit I don #8217;t wanna do? Therapy isn #8217;t working because it #8217;s biased towards my parents I #8217;m locked in the house most of the day I have no phone, a computer I can use every once and awhile, and a TV with no signed in channels. I #8217;m fucking lost, I haven #8217;t been able to talk to my friends, I haven #8217;t been able to talk to my crush who fucking admitted she liked me a week before this wave of shit and torture happened. I don #8217;t know what to do and I feel stupid as fuck going on here but I have nothing else to do other than try and talk to other ppl like me. Edit: I #8217;m also worried I #8217;m gonna be sent to a mental hospital because when my parents saw my cuts they threatened to get me admitted. So that #8217;s great.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I have an anti mask mom. She #8217;s gone to extremes trying to say masks don #8217;t work. YES THEY ARENT SOME MAGICAL SHIELD THAT GUARANTEES SAFETY BUT THEY ARE AN IMPORTANT PART OF GOING OUT. It #8217;s not like wearing them protects you to a high level right in front of another person, but it does for sure limit the number of droplets in the air. That way more people can come through that area with a lower risk of getting sick. The worst part is she #8217;s a nurse, and she #8217;s against masks. She #8217;s bought into all the far right bullshit of  #8220;they are trying to suppress us #8221; and what not. I understand you can be frustrated, but nobody is forcing you to do anything. You want food? Make an order and pick it up. You need groceries? Same thing. You wanna take a walk? Walk in your neighborhood. But when you are around other people, be considerate.</TEXT>
