    <TEXT>Practice through the changes playing only single notes in your right hand with only a metronome. Start with just arpeggios and chord tones on the first chorus, and get freer on the next. This will help you internalize the form. Practicing with a metronome in general can #8217;t be understated - also, try playing with the metronome only on 2 and 4, or 1 and 3, or maybe just one beat to really internalize the groove.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>The people who played early jazz were not in orchestras or formal brass bands, this assimilation happened later when musicians started leading jazz orchestras. The brass bands that played early jazz never previously played European music in a classical music sense, and it certainly wasn #8217;t orchestras that started playing jazz. The brass bands that you #8217;re referring to were generally already street musicians getting together and improvising. I also hate to make this distinction, but it #8217;s very important: jazz didn #8217;t start with white musicians in classical settings incorporating African-American musical concepts like improvisation and the blues, but when an African-American base of rhythm and blues used certain European harmonic concepts.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Practice single-note lines right hand only with a metronome on a selected tune so you can really get the harmony ingrained. When learning a new tune, run through the arpeggios with a metronome. When transcribing, don #8217;t worry as much about the chords the piano is playing unless you #8217;re specifically transcribing for chord melody and accompaniment (still know the underlying harmony of the tune, just don #8217;t worry about what they #8217;re specifically playing). TRANSCRIBE HORN PLAYERS. This way you #8217;ll learn melodic lines and not rely on your left hand for harmonic information. You should have ingrained in you your place in the form at all times and not need left hand accompaniment.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Kurt Rosenwinkel's version of How Deep is the Ocean from Intuit does this, and Kurt's soloing is killer. Benny Benack III's version of Irrepressible also does this. I'll let you know if I think of any more.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Wynton Kelly's or Miles Davis' solos on Freddie Freeloader are fantastic beginner solos. While his solos get very difficult technically, learning the first few choruses of a Keith Jarrett solo on a blues is great for learning how to create melodies over the changes. For chords, you can't beat accompaniment by Wynton Kelly (the Miles album Someday My Prince Will Come is a fantastic example), Bill Evans, Red Garland, or Tommy Flanagan. For more 60s post-bop oriented language and harmony, check out McCoy Tyner and Herbie Hancock. Lastly, if you want to check out the greatest pianists and keyboardists working today, take a look at Aaron Parks, Robert Glasper, Brad Mehldau, or Christian Sands. There are so many more than what I mentioned, but hopefully this can give you a good starting point.</TEXT>
