    <TEXT>Your gorgeous hair and matching facial hair have such an amazing color of dense, red clay from a few feet of digging past the dirt in my home state of Florida. Your hair and facial hair, the color is exactly like that lovely red clay. Your eyebrows stand out, and accentuate your expression, with a black or near-black color, and your eyes shine with intelligence, if perhaps with a touch of sadness. The skin around your eyes speaks to furrowed brows and serious expressions for years, with lots of humor mixed in. Your lips are slightly pale. Your lips are not quite pink, as if to suggest that the expression on your face was just put on for the photo, and that they have not had time yet to redden from smiling. You visible body size makes the idea of a 20-second-or-longer hug seem irresistible.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Hi. I raised and hatched chickens, ducks, geese, turkeys, and guineas for many years. Unfortunately, this type of leg formation is a deformity. It can go a couple of ways. I tried with many of these club-footed chicks to try to make a makeshift brace out of different things, and in theory, that should work, but it never did for me. Most production-driven poultry farms will  #8220;cull #8221; chicks with this deformity. That means they would kill them. That is not what I #8217;m suggesting, because I raised birds as pets. The last option is to let the chick grow up; sometimes they do adopt a way of walking unique to their condition and the leg will never straiten out, but the chick adapts to live with its deformity. The chick could flourish and live fine, or it could get weak and die. It #8217;s not the most fun part of raising poultry, but it #8217;s important that you know the possible outcomes. There are many birth defects that poultry can overcome and still thrive with. Good luck to you and please let me know what you plan to do. EDIT- if you decide that you want the chick to continue living and try to overcome its disability, maybe don #8217;t put it with the other chicks for a good while. Chicks with mobility issues can often fall underneath their hatch-mates and be trampled to death.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I #8217;m glad you #8217;re going to try to get him to live! There #8217;s one other thing. Chickens are social animals; they never want to live alone and they imprint on either their mothers if a hen hatches them, or they become kinda bonded to the other chicks if there is no mother. This chick will likely imprint on you, even if you only check on him a couple times a day. I feel bad for him, so I encourage you to give him frequent check-ins, petting, etc., because honestly, any poultry that is left completely alone for a long time, they kinda go a little crazy. Also I hope that you have it #8217;s water in a chick waterer, not a bowl or something because he #8217;s more likely to get tired while drinking and not be able to get out of a bowl and might drown. If you don #8217;t mind, pm me sometime; I would like to know how this little dude turns out.</TEXT>

You could also dip your finger in the sugar water and place one drop at a time on his beak. Most often, if you do that, a chick will do a little nibbling and the water will go into his mouth.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Good question. I #8217;m betting there is some kind of organic or synthetic odors that would discourage predators from coming to the chickens. By that I mean scents that resemble that of urine of a bigger predator, etc. Like putting doe urine around a place where you #8217;d want to hunt deer. Unfortunately, any predator, if hungry enough, will disregard things like that. Also, I have never in my life seen a chicken pen made well enough that no mammals or at least snakes could penetrate.</TEXT>

These were always known to my friend and I as Maypop flowers. The fruit is green, almost like limes, and encased is a sac of seeds. Not any real fruit to speak of inside. We used to take apart the  #8220;fruit #8221; and leave the seeds encased in their thin membrane and tell other little kids that these were spider egg sacks! It fooled most of them. So yes, this has been my favorite flower since about age 7, and it wasn #8217;t until a couple years ago that I heard  #8220;Passion flower. #8221; That sounds a lot more fancy than Maypop...</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I #8217;m barely a beginner. I got my very basic first ukulele as a surprise gift from my mom to help me cope with being a new mom with working and driving limitations. So I have some time. My uke is very basic; I #8217;m not even sure it is a real brand... it #8217;s a basic black, and I #8217;ve been using the app Yousician. If anyone knows any good or bad stuff about that, please tell me.. for my real query, my basic black uke does not visually speak to my soul. My husband mentioned that perhaps I should get some paint pens and decorate it. Would that throw off the musical vibrations of the instrument? Any more advice as a really green beginner?</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I #8217;m a beginner at the uke, and was surprised with one. My mom researched a little and bought a nearly-no-name ukulele kit on Amazon dot com. It was about $70. I am learning slowly on the Yousician app. I #8217;m using the paid version. I have only played piano in the past. It #8217;s going good so far, and though this is my only experience with uke so far, my opinion would definitely be to get an instrument that is not so expensive that you will be losing something if you decide down the road that you don #8217;t want to play it. As for myself, I #8217;m learning at a slow pace and I will probably get a better ukulele when I have passed from beginner to a more intermediate level</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I don #8217;t have any chickens now, but the ones I #8217;ve had the most of were bantam cochins. I loved them SO MUCH!! They are calm, easy to tame, great as pets, gentle, great mothers, equally great layers, and the roosters, if raised by hand, are not aggressive. They come in very many colors and also there is the frizzle variations of some bantam Cochins. Since they are smaller birds, you must take that into consideration when you build their pens. Another factor to consider is the predators in and around your area that will be looking to feed on them and their eggs. Overall, probably my favorite breed of chickens ever.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Chickens don #8217;t get rabies, but what you really need to watch out for is infection in the wounds. That #8217;s probably more worrisome than her being blind. I had a chicken get into our tool shed, get startled, and fly up onto sharp things, giving her various wounds. She seemed fine after a small stage of shock. I went to get her to give her to a friend, and beneath her wing (probably made worse by the heat) was a wound that was rampant with maggots. I #8217;m sorry to say that, but any animal attack on a chicken is almost always fatal. Hoping the best for y #8217;all.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Why am I so easy to throw away, It may seem like coincidence, But it happens every day I used to think it was everyone else, I never considered it was myself Who perpetuated sorrow and pain I never considered I wasn't sane! But for all the trouble and sacrifice, My heart is frozen, made of ice! I never found who was to blame For making my heart so hard to tame. Dimly lit by a darken sun, The fight within me rages on. I look into the fractured sky I can't see past these tears, and wonder why I feel so scared and all alone; Does my heart even have a home? Where did all my promises go, The ones I made to myself? I'm so alive but have no hope, My screams are not for help. Of all the sorrows I have seen I still don't know what my dreams mean... But if they are so foretell our fate, I'm sorry, self, but it's too late. I step into the water so very cold, Soon numbness will set in, I'm told. I take some steps and plunge right in, I gasp in the water and my lungs begin To shudder and panic, not that it matters, My soul breaks free and begins to shatter. My hair is floating next to my eyes I will no longer have to live the lies. My hair is floating around my face, I am transported to a different place. I used to fight and want to win, But now I #8217;m slowly giving in. I #8217;m paralyzed but completely aware, I look in the mirror and there #8217;s no one there.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Take this light to remind you That I'm not always dark and grim Help the good me find me, Help the light within me kick in, Because I promise someday I'll succeed And not give in to bitterness or greed. And sometimes I need help to fight, To squint to find your distant light But with your help I could fight and win Somehow, some way, I'll be here for you again</TEXT>

    <TEXT>This most critique I can say that this poem is FULL of feelings, and they are vivid. I think that if I had to rate this poem with one word, I was say  #8220;Raw #8221; Because it #8217;s full of honest emotions. It conveys the feelings of perhaps betrayal, sorrow, and feelings of being lost, not knowing where to turn. Did I get all of any of that right?</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Hi, thank you for your feedback! Actually, I did mean  #8220;hopelessness, #8221; because by saying it was strong and such I was hoping to personify the feeling.... like how it promised to be with me until the end. This may be kind of emo, but a lot of my writing is negative and sad. This is mostly because i have severe depression and I write my poetry as a therapeutic way of realizing my feelings. Here as of late, I have been trying to get some variety into my writing</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Hi and thank you for the feedback. As a matter of fact, there was a time when I was diagnosed with SAD, as well as bipolar disorder, manic depression and severe anxiety. That was years ago, and I no longer have any SAD symptoms. I was only a lot of medication long ago and they seemed to be working against me. Now I just have the manic depression and severe anxiety. As for this poem, I internalize a lot of my emotions, so I usually write when I #8217;m sad or anxious. I #8217;ve been exploring a few non-emo subjects to write about</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Thank you for your feedback and analysis! 1. I like that thought about the  #8220;arts #8221; 2. I too was not happy with  #8220;then something happened, #8221; but the more poignant ending is meant to capture hopelessness in a way like quicksand, swallowing someone up. 3. I can understand how many people appreciate poetry with a steady rhyme flow (like ABAB, CDCD), and while my rhyme approach is a bit back and forth, I did it intentionally, but I will look at it again to see if there is any possibility of me making it slightly more traditional. 4. I can understand why you would suggest that this poem would work well with a more positive ending, but I mean for this poem to display how heavy depression is, but I suppose if I were to make this poem not end at the same point that it was started, I would finish the work by saying something like numbness set in, or acceptance, something along those lines</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I try to recycle when I can, and I #8217;m poor, so a lot of my plant pots are former food containers.

From Him I feel such light and love; Do you know who I'm speaking of? For so long I lived in shadows, More than I could ever disclose. So much I long to understand What makes my Maker move his hand. He's helped me more than I can say, But still I hope I can one day That some day, I can fathom And serve with enthusiasm. I want to learn and comprehend What I must do before the end. I want my Maker satisfied When I've come and testified And be someone who He is proud of, Because He given me so much love.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>If I #8217;m right from my own experience hatching, sometimes the chick doesn #8217;t absorb all of the yolk before hatching. Maybe the hatch goes too quickly, or the yolk got pulled a certain way away from the vent, etc, but the chances of the chick getting better and surviving are kind of 50/50. What I used to do with chicks with this issue would be to keep the vent moistened with warm water (not very wet) and hope that the vent would correct itself. It has to be kept moist to be pulled into the body properly. If it dries out or gets feed on it, it wouldn #8217;t likely heal and the chick would likely perish</TEXT>

    <TEXT>In my experience, chickens who are not raised with frequent human contact will take a long time to learn that fingers are not part of the menu. It has to do with their sight, which is fairly sharp, and their understanding, which though I love chickens, they can seem pretty dumb. If you raise chickens by hand, especially as pets, you will notice that they seem smarter than a non-tamed chicken. That really isn #8217;t the case, but non hand raised chickens are focused on eating, mating, and that #8217;s about it, while hand raised chickens turn out to have other interests, like perching on their human #8217;s lap or arm, etc. Non tame chickens just haven #8217;t learned that your fingers are a part of you</TEXT>

There IS a way to sex them yourself, but I #8217;ve never been able to do it. You have to literally look at their vent (butthole) and make an interpretation of the genitals inside the chicks. I believe there are diagrams that explain it. However if you are hatching your own eggs, you will get more female chicks when incubating are a higher temperature</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I would say that bigger is not always better. Some karambits are made for looks because they are quite striking to look at, but because they are shaped like cat claws, you don #8217;t need a huge one. Also, they #8217;re a pain in the butt to sharpen, but wow are they cool. I don #8217;t like fixed blades, and there #8217;s lots of options for folding karambits, but if you #8217;re shopping online like on Amazon, search for curved blade knife instead of karambit because they are a style of knife that is popularized and there are lots of cheap versions that will be cheaper, but also have less quality.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Okay, you got me, karambits are not super useful in an every day way, but when I got for walks alone, I carry one for just-in-case self defense. Straight knives are mostly good for a self defense style of stabbing, as in an up-and-down swing. Being how karambits are inwardly curved, a self defense movement would be more like swiping, like a cat swiping at a bug style. This could be done in a more side-side motion. Think how in Jurassic Park they showed the raptor claw. Karambits resemble claws a bit. If an attacker was coming at me, I would feel more secure being armed with a weapon that I could use multiple slashes and different angling techniques. A straight knife is only so effective with slash style defenses, and limited to up and down defense. Having said that, I have never been in a knife fight, I am just highly imaginative and have my self defense system thoroughly thought out, although I will probably never require it</TEXT>

    <DATE>2020-05-29 18:54:03</DATE>
    <TEXT>Hi. I #8217;m a first time SAHM and my little boy is 15 months, but he was born 2.5 months early. He has his four middle top teeth and his four middle bottom teeth. He got those a few months ago. Now, he #8217;s showing all the signs of teething: he #8217;s drooling a lot, keeps his hand stuck on one part inside his mouth, and he #8217;s very fussy and clingy. When his center teeth started coming in, it was easy to foresee because the were slightly translucent right before they surfaced. Now, in his mouth right side back him, there is a small swelling, definitely not anything infected, but I can #8217;t see into his mouth to really tell if that tooth is coming in. Anyone have any ideas to tell if he #8217;s about to cut a tooth? I felt along his gum and did feel a hard small lump where the suspected tooth would be.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I love this poem for a few reasons. Your rhyming sequence almost always matches the syllables of paired sentences. I really like the way that your rhymes don #8217;t pair exactly to each paired words. I mean more that you use approximately rhyming words and it is easy to appreciate this. The other reason that I love this poem is because I feel like I could have written it. As in, my mother and I had similar interactions for years and years, and I #8217;m finally making peace with the past, as well as the present. But not the future. It is futile to try to foresee the future. If you want to, message me and we can compare opinions on our moms</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Your form seems to be divided into 3-sentence groups, but I see so much of an opportunity to make your 3 sentence stanzas into 4 sentence stanzas. I feel like you might find it pleasing too, because it would allow you more freedom to explore more rhymes and rhythms. Now, please don #8217;t do it if you feel like you have your poem put together. I just think that your imagery would be beautifully paired with a more flowing rhyme and rhythm. And of course your imagery is great. Hope I helped a little.</TEXT>

It #8217;s as if I #8217;m a magnet, but instead of attract It #8217;s more like I #8217;m pushing everyone back. I try not to think about or assign a blame But when I do I only think of my name. I #8217;ve been called selfish and thoughtless, and it #8217;s true But I never wanted to inflict that on you. How could I make up for such crimes as this If all of my targets I aim and I miss?

    <TEXT>Hi. Thank you for your feedback. The way I prefer to link rhymes is by going to/from a scheme like  #8220;AA BB AA CDCD #8221; and so forth. I #8217;m very OCD about rhyming, and I change up the pattern as often as I can. Line 6 I think is possibly where I changed the rhyming pattern, so maybe that #8217;s why it has less flow. Thank you for the punctuation advice. Also, I like your idea of grouping the stanzas and skipping a line, and I actually did this when I wrote the poem on my notebook paper, but I am still new to Reddit and wanted to make sure there was at least some kind of spacing. Thanks, good advice all around!</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Thank you. Oddly enough I have had some interesting experiences with death. From childhood, I was afraid of dead things in general. Of anything dead other than cooked meat, even things like leather or a bone-in steak or something. Then I had a pet chicken die. I was very attached to her. So attached that when she perished, I could not bury her. So I built her a cairn that #8217;s allowed her body to remain cool and dry without being exposed to the elements. Being a grieving teen, I looked at her remains periodically and overcame my phobia.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>This Cilantro took maybe 7 days to germinate and we are in South Georgia US. I placed the seeds (maybe 10 of them) in a folded moist paper towel and placed that inside a Ziploc bag in the window. Once they sprouted, I did not detach the wet paper towel, but buried the paper towel I about a half inch of soil in the plant pot. I watered the sprouts once daily in partial sun. Every few days I would use a small stick to poke holes in the paper towel, as it helps to biodegrade the paper towel into the dirt. It was easy; I never had any instructions, this is just how I germinate my seeds and it has always worked.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>That is hilarious that he wants to breed shoes and stuffed animals... but there is one thing I #8217;d be concerned with about that! We had outdoor chickens as well, and multiple roosters. There was one hen that we called  #8220;Favorite #8221; because all the roosters preferred to breed her than any other hen. It was very apparent that she was the favorite hen, because her vent was always yucky and wet from rooster stuff.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Actually most chickens or chicks will be calm when you turn them upside down like that. If you keep them upside down or on their backs too long, they will go unconscious or even die. That #8217;s one of the reasons that when farmers pick up a rooster to kill for food, they carry them by the legs. They sort of pass out and if they remain upside down long enough, they will stop breathing. I can #8217;t be 100% positive, but it may also apply to ducks, turkeys, guineas, peacocks, and other fowl..</TEXT>

    <TEXT>This looks cute, but it has me wondering if he #8217;s not ill or has some neurological issue. When baby chicks are turned upside down like that, they quickly fall asleep. If they are held like that too long, they die. This is because chickens do not have whatever is physically necessary to keep breathing while upside down. I wonder if your guy is falling from seizures or convulsions and going unconscious. The only chickens or chicks I #8217;ve ever seen lay like this for very long were dead.</TEXT>

If it wasn #8217;t for generous people at our church, I would not have been able to see him often at all. I don #8217;t know if you are a part of a church or not, but that probably won #8217;t matter if you approach a member of a local church for help.

    <TEXT>I #8217;m gonna put my dirty laundry out for all to see, with a hope to help. I have plenty of PTSD, and I #8217;m my early twenties, I did plenty of ecstasy. While it was overall enjoyable, I did not get any closure from my PTSD from using ecstasy. Others might have better luck, but there is one other factor to consider... Without knowing, I had a form of dormant epilepsy, from birth and on, but no seizures since around age 3. The very first night I did ecstasy, I had around 5 grand mal seizures that lasted a really long time. I, being the stupid young adult that I was, did not let that stop me from doing The drug again and again. Ecstasy can be fun as hell, and possibly therapeutic, maybe, but try to learn all you can BEFORE you do it. Do not do it alone, and take care to keep cool as it will make you overheat quickly. Be certain to hydrate yourself with lots of water. Those with a seizure disorder should be very careful. Even though I stopped doing ecstasy many years ago, my seizures persist.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I know you have said that you don #8217;t want the chick to die. If you really want that, a vet appointment is probably the only thing you can do. Unfortunately, oftentimes chicks will trample others, out of fear or just crowding. I have never had a trampled chick that survived and lead a normal life. Once chickens or chicks are injured, their chances for thriving are greatly reduced. A vet visit cannot even ensure the chick #8217;s survival, but it is pretty safe to say that without vet attention, the chick will not likely survive without disabilities.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>When I had chickens as pets, it was usually the local wildlife that depleted our flock. Having said that, there were many times that neighborhood pets killed our chickens. The first thing to do is to make yourself a chicken coop or pen. That way you take care of your own obligations to keep your poultry safe. Next, report your losses to local police or other civil servants who can document your loss should more losses occur. Contact your neighbor, maybe not in person, maybe keep documentation of your interactions in case things go awry. Be civil above all else; don #8217;t entangle yourself with any enemies</TEXT>

You can have around 5-7 of them in a 10 gallon freshwater tank without issue... but they get big fast. They start out as being very silver and sometimes with red bellies. Pretty fish, if a bit nippy. They have sometimes been used in films to appear as piranhas. They do look similar, but I think pacu get way bigger thank piranhas.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Yeah, that makes sense to me, mostly. The way that I write is more prioritizing the rhyme over the message. I feel like it #8217;s part of my OCD. It #8217;s something I fight against, because the rhymes make the poem (just in my case, not in other folks poetry), but I just plain cannot have a non-rhyming poem.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I used to raise all kinds of chickens as pets. So so many birds over the years. We have had some chicks with very similar deformities and it #8217;s usually some kind of mis-development while the chick is incubating, but sometimes can be genetics. The outcome really just depends on the severity of the deformities, the actions taken by the owner human, and the chick #8217;s overall strength. The most you can do is to not make special accommodations for the chick unless it #8217;s necessary for the chick #8217;s survival. This will force the chick to try hard to survive in competition with the other chicks and will make it become strong. Just make sure that the chick is putting on weight and growing. The chick may develop a limp or other atypical gait, but if it is strong, it will thrive. One thing you can do to help the chick is to not let your brooder get cold or the chicks will bundle together and the weaker chicks may get trampled.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Okay, the beats. You should only change stuff if it makes sense to you and applies to how you feel about your poem, but I will explain. Here is an example. If I were to write a pair of sentences within a poem like, I feel a sort of loneliness-8 syllables But it #8217;s not you that I miss-7 syllables You can see that these two lines make perfect sense and rhyme just fine... however, (and this is just me) I like any two rhyming lines to contain either the same number of syllables or at least close to one another. So I #8217;ll do my best to adjust whichever line to match the number of syllables in those two rhyming lines, such as follows: I feel a sort of loneliness- 8 syllables But it is not you that I miss- 8 syllables Let me reiterate that I am overwhelmingly OCD. So it is just by my own parameters that I try to match up syllables in two rhyming lines of a poem. One could even say that I am being anal about it, and that would not be untrue. But to me, it #8217;s fun to do that, I feel like it creates a nice flow in the poem, and it provides just a small extra challenge to push your skill to the limit. Just saying that you ought not change it if your mind or heart says not to. It #8217;s just my crazy, self applied rules.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>So if you #8217;re trying to keep the length of a line similar to its rhyming mate, do you mean like the visible length when written or typed? Or the length as in how the line sounds? If you ever want to keep lines possessing a center number of syllables, there #8217;s an easy cheat! Simply said the line out loud while counting (even if it #8217;s on your fingers) how many syllables are contained in one line. If you mean to alter the line, simply go into your mind and evaluate any synonyms for words that could increase or decrease the syllables. Just to me, it #8217;s fun AND a rule (for my own poetry).</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Haiku pose a challenge in that they require a minimalist approach to create a depth of meaning. Of course, the 5-7-5 syllable style also put parameters on the message that is to be conveyed by readers. I like haiku, but I #8217;m often distracted by nothing more than two intriguing words that rhyme and I build my poems around what the two rhyming words are, and I am unable to condense any poems to any minimalistic approach.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Chickens can lose weight and fail to thrive without really appearing ill or sick. One way to check is to touch the breastbone on the chicken, like a few inches below its throat. Is the bone there pointy and prominent? If so, the chicken possibly died of malnutrition. A lot of people may only feed their chickens corn, or scratch. Corn and scratch are like candy to chickens: they love it, but there aren #8217;t a lot of nutrients in either. It helps chickens a lot to free range so that they can get leafy greens and protein from bugs. Aside from that, it doesn #8217;t sound like your chickens had any diseases, considering that their combs were bright and eyes unclouded. That #8217;s where I would start. Beyond that, there is the chance of worms, but I have never had any chickens with parasites, so I would be unhelpful to advise anything for that.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>If you touch the deceased chicken and it #8217;s breastbone presents as very pointy and prominent, it leads to show that there is either a sickness or a parasite or a nutrition issue. It #8217;s unlikely that it #8217;s nutrition, seeing as how you feed them scratch, grain, bread, watermelon, and they have access to forage. Chickens can get worms, some kind, somehow, and I would bet that would make them lose weight and certainly lay less eggs. It doesn #8217;t sound stupid that some animals can get scared off very loud noises like a mower, but I have never heard of chickens dying from that. There is a chicken body part called the craw. It is somewhat below their throat but above the breastbone. In healthy chickens, it will feel like a solid balloon, because everything a chicken eats is sent to the craw before the stomach. If you were to find another dead chicken, feel for the breastbone. If it is super pointy, it indicates that for whatever reason, the chicken was losing weight. Then feel the craw. If it is full, it indicates that the chicken was feeding well, so probably not a nutrition issue: chickens don #8217;t eat well if they feel sickly. If the craw is near empty, that indicates that for some reason that bird was not eating. I would venture to think that with all the physical stuff on your chickens appear that they were healthy, perhaps they ate something that their bodies could not handle, like a toxic plant, bug, or poison. Fertilizer hurts chickens too. But if egg production decreased, it may be because the chickens #8217; body energy is not going to egg production, but to another task, like fighting off infection or something. Sorry for the long winded speech; I just can #8217;t assess all of the possibilities. Good luck</TEXT>

Especially when you feel that there is no hope. This is well written! Don #8217;t delay to use writing as a therapeutic tool, and don #8217;t let anyone try to convince you to write just positive minded stuff or anything that doesn #8217;t serve you to feel better. Positive writing is awesome, but never do it because someone else wants you to. If you #8217;re anything like me, writing is something intimate and personal.</TEXT>

Well, about a week ago I kinda checked out because I had some health issues. I thought all my plants would be okay, but... We have been having daily thunderstorms, so watering was not the issue. My little patchouli was potted, but it had called to its side under another plant. When I discovered it, the leaves were brown, but not dry. I put some coffee grounds on the soil and gave it lots of water. Today I went to check on it and the leaves were dry and crackely! Did I kill it? Do I try to salvage the root?

I ask myself how we got so intertwined, Two hearts beat as one with a shared mind As if our two souls have become aligned. For you are my shade, my light, my muse and not just one could I ever choose. Just hold onto my hand, don't let it go, There are so many things left to see and to show! Our last touch falters, you're slipping away I gasp for your hand but it's moving astray. I love you, I need you, you are all I have got; The world can go on without you, but I cannot.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I don #8217;t have a lot of time to discuss this rn, so let #8217;s explain it with one example: the exercise of control. Hannibal kills, usually those who are one or more, in his way, close to exposing his crimes, or worst of all, rude. Recalling that Hannibal killed a flutist specifically to improve the sound of the Baltimore orchestra, we can find Hannibal #8217;s murders of each person for one or more reasons. Except who? Mason Verger. Could he have killed MV? Certainly. Why didn #8217;t he? There could be lots, but I speculate a couple of theories. Firstly, if one believes that Hannibal has a NEED to kill, that need could have been temporarily satiated by a very recent murder prior to that. Probably more likely, Hannibal was very aware of MV #8217;s ego and love of himself and Hannibal #8217;s contempt for MV left him with a desire to see MV in an inescapable and lamentable hell that he knew as his life: disfigured, disabled, and incapable. So, was Hannibal addicted to murder? Or was it pleasure seeking? My own opinion is based on my non-murder experience with addiction and pleasure-seeking behavior. Would it be fair to say that all addiction begins with pleasure seeking behavior? I would say so. In fact, I would venture to say that most addictions begin with pleasure seeking behaviors. Addiction is a physiological need. Physiological needs are somewhere between physical and psychological needs, yes? And addiction is a state in which one can not properly function without that feeling, substance, etc. An addiction is that state in which you begin to sacrifice things you may want or need to procure something that you are addicted to. In order to determine if Hannibal #8217;s murders serve an addiction, you must already take into account that they are definitely performed to serve a pleasure-seeking behavior. Is he addicted to murder? My first instinct is to say no, because he is shown (as much as the Hannibal Lecter fictional character is shown) to be able to restrain himself from murdering anyone unless it is his unpressed choice to or if a need arises. The true answer to this venture would be to test the theory, and examine a given time period in the life of Hannibal to see if he could function successfully without committing a murder. We have already seen that he can exercise certain control of his acts, so I would be more likely to assume that while his murderous tendencies definitely serve a pleasure-seeking behavior, he is probably not a technical addict in any way. I believe that if there is any symptom of Hannibal that is uncontrollable, as in an addiction, that it would be his urge to consume parts of who he kills. This would be a psychological need to show his victory over those who murdered and thereafter ate his sister Mischa during Hannibal #8217;s childhood. While Hannibal may not perform cannibalism on every one of his murder victims, it appears to be his natural go-to mechanism to show his superiority to those he thinks little of.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I will say that the closest match that I like that was suggested was the Cold Steel Black Talon. Thank you for your other suggestions, and with all due respect to the Spyderco brand (as I am sure they are very nice), in order to arm our household with decent home defense artillery, I do not have the kind of funds to arm my person with that of Spyderco. I would love to be able to afford on-person blades of high price. Let me say that from what I can see, Spyderco has some damned nice stuff, but for now to afford our guns, our blade funds are kind of too modest for Spyderco at this time. Also, if I #8217;m doomed to shop  #8220;pieces of shit from eBay, #8221; we might as well call it what it is and rename the Spyderco community as  #8220;Snob-er-co #8221;. Also.... I did buy the piece of shit off of eBay. The only thing that prevented me from buying it before was the orange color. I #8217;m sure I #8217;ll spend some time figuring out a way to get rid of or cover the orange... and I bet I won #8217;t spend a penny</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Bridges of peace in a world apart, I make all my efforts to give you my heart. Can you help me bear the weight and the strain, Will you help me with the passion and pain? Disagreements and disillusions set me farther from you, Though most of the time, our negative interactions are few. How is it though I will forever stay, The more I feel hurt, I drift farther away? Sometimes when I'm not feeling so well, I wonder if I might be in Heaven or Hell, Instead of my life which doesn't seem really real, Because I can't quite connect with how I should feel. If my scars are meant to remind me what's happened, They wouldn't suggest anything I could have imagined, And my mind would move on to all I would forget, And how to remember what hasn't happened yet. I'm a willing participant of my amnesia, My lack of memories is my anesthesia.</TEXT>

I used to want to go back and to do it again, But this late in the game, there is no way I would win. Trying to swim in waters to which I am already lost, There aren't many lines that I haven't already crossed. As I dip underwater, I may cross one more line, Above me there is just one star left to shine: I hope my faults all everyone else will forgive, I don't have the hope or the will left to live.</TEXT>

I haven #8217;t had a driver #8217;s license in maybe 12 years and I am terrified to try to get my license back even if I do go the required time seizure free.

The last thing I remember was standing at the shallow end, not in the water, and noticing the sparkles that the sun made on the water. After that, I came to on the concrete beside the poor, scraped up, and had a weird unjustified sense of guilt. I came to find out that I fell into the pool convulsing and that one person out of the pool had to pull me up while a person in the pool helped to lift my ass out of the pool.

If a person with epilepsy is wearing an ID that says  #8220;Seizures, #8221; the EMT would understand that that person has a history of seizures and that it is more common for that individual to have one.

Maybe I shouldn #8217;t walk or stand because I might seize and fall and crack my skull open. I used to speed walk all over my neighborhood in order to lose weight. One day, I totally seized and lost consciousness in the middle of the road. A driver began to turn down the road I lay on and saw me before he hit me, called an ambulance, and all I remember was thanking the man and ambulance folks, and vaguely noting the the driver of the car was an elderly man. As soon as my injuries were healed enough, plus around 2 days, I resumed walking. Life is too alive to not live it (just for a dumb  #8220;disability #8221;). Live life.</TEXT>

I would whisper to her,  #8220;Co-chiiiiin, chin-chin! #8221; And she would reply like this chicken did, the high pitched chirping, but my chicken said,  #8220;Brrrr-brrrrrr, brrr-brr! #8221; It kept my bff awake at night and she used to fuss and tell me to stop telling my chicken to talk!

    <TEXT>I was told that Keppra has a antidepressant effect. If you are willing to, maybe ask your doctor for a low dose of an antidepressant, such as Lexapro (a common and inexpensive antidepressant). If you would rather not do that, I would suggest that you do try CBD oil or marijuana if it is legal in your state. Beware that if you have a seizure disorder, stopping it may trigger some seizures. I hope you stepped down from Keppra gradually instead of stopping it cold turkey.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I'm nobody's favorite anything anymore, I've burned all my bridges and I can't make it to shore. So many faces, looking, and frowning, I try to tread water, but already I'm drowning. I've driven off family and friends with my mistakes, And when reminded of them, every time my heart breaks. I used to want to go back and to do it again, But this late in the game, there is no way I would win. Trying to swim in waters to which I am already lost, There aren't many lines that I haven't already crossed. As I dip underwater, I may cross one more line, Above me there is just one star left to shine: I hope my faults all everyone else will forgive, I ask them, I beg them, to continue to live.</TEXT>

It was told to me by my doctor that I exhibited seizures as a small child, it went dormant for years, then returned as I became an adult. Sometimes when I exhert myself or do a lot of physical activity, I get really really hyper or fueled by endorphins, then I experience a big crash in which I suddenly feel an aura, begin slurring my words, lose appetite, and become very very shaky. Anyone else got that going on? Why?</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I #8217;m sure I will get shit about this, but that #8217;s okay. I was younger than 10 when I had to shoot my first flock predator. I have shot many many possums (the most common killer that we had where I lived) and I have even killed possums with babies inside their pouches that I in turn had to kill (humanely as I could, with carbon monoxide). I have even illegally shot a peregrine falcon, which I cried horribly over, but it was in the midst of killing one of my chickens. For me, pets are like children in the way that you take responsibility for what you raise, and sometimes that means harming something else. So, yeah, having chickens, or goats, or cats, or kids... there is an outright need to care for what you keep. There isn #8217;t a two way street with that. Unless you #8217;re up for relocating wild animals that threaten or harm your flock.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I used a .22 for all of my chicken raising years too. No, I didn #8217;t like killing anything, but I was able to appreciate it for its necessity when called for. One particular incident didn #8217;t involve the chickens: I got dropped off by the school bus when I was maybe 12. One of our cats the stayed outside was maybe 2 feet from a large and very angry rattlesnake and it was rattling and poised to strike. I went and got my gun and knew that I would miss my first shot because i had to stay a safe distance from the snake, but I feared that my shot would cause the snake to strike the cat... so I got a stick and threw it right at my cat #8217;s face. The stick hit him right on the nose and worked how I wanted: the cat ran away from the snake (even if his nose probably hurt like hell), then I was free to shoot at the snake as many times as I needed to send him to snake Heaven. I like to say better safe than sorry, so even for people who never intends to use a gun should maybe consider basic gun safety protocols</TEXT>

She sleeps under the covers in my arms every night. She whines and flees from my son.

    <TEXT>Hi. I found out about my seizures when I was already in a relationship. It never presented a real problem as our relationship already had big, ongoing issues. My seizures were ultimately not the biggest problem with the relationship and the relationship ended. I eventually became unable to drive and also stopped working. Building new relationships became difficult, so I began making friends and building relationships with apps and internet. I always put in whatever profile I had to introduce myself state a minor disclaimer about my seizures early on in the profile. If someone messaged me, I would of course talk to them about whatever subjects naturally were brought up. Only if I decided to meet someone did I bring up the already mentioned subject of seizures. I was never able to determine if that was a reason to cross me off of someone #8217;s interest or not. It generally seemed to address the issue and eliminate it as a negative issue. Always, though, the first seizure I had with someone who had never seen one was usually a dramatic happening and caused a lot of concern.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I #8217;d also like to add that when requesting a lower dosage, that my past doctors have been hesitant to agree :/ It seems that some doctors are shady when you want to reduce dosages on anticonvulsants (and many other kinds of meds) because if there is a resulting seizure (or other health risk related to lowered meds), some folks can and might sue. Doctors demand tests to safeguard their patients #8217; health, but hand in hand is the doctors #8217; legal risk.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Hello. I have never done LSD myself, but I have heard that it is very easy to have a  #8220;bad trip. #8221; It sounds like you had a pretty bad seizure. I can #8217;t honestly say that the LSD cause your seizure, but the likelihood increases when your stress levels are high. My only advice to you would be: maybe don #8217;t take LSD, if you do take LSD, consider taking any anticonvulsant meds you have prior to it, and also tell the people who you are with what is possible to happen. Explain to them what is happening to you during a seizure and what you would like them to do or not to do. Also, maybe explain to them that seizures are no fun, but often not life-threatening. I have had seizures my whole life but I didn #8217;t truly understand why people got so upset until I saw a client of mine have one.</TEXT>

I am usually very sore after a seizure, but my throat has discomfort, so I don #8217;t like to take pills right away. Maybe use some Icyhot? Also, offer small sips of water.

Also, (as my neurologist told me) that if I begin to feel an aura, taking an extra Keppra or two is not unsafe. Please do not take my word for it, ask your doctor. I have also been on Depakote, but I hear that it ruins your liver or kidneys and it #8217;s a real pain in the butt to get off of. I #8217;m talking angry withdrawal pains, nausea, dizziness.

I #8217;m not sure why, but it does really alleviate the headache some. One more thing I would do to comfort him is to when you start to see him come out of it... is he usually confused for a bit? Every time I come to consciousness someone tells me that o had a seizure and my usual response is  #8220;Huh? No I didn #8217;t. #8221; Maybe just tell him hi, in a slower, calm manner, explain that he has had a seizure and keep a hand on his.

    <TEXT>Sometimes I get reflective on myself in past years. I have had many people in my life that I really really liked, possibly even loved, and most of them did not particularly like or love me. As I look back on all of these individuals, I am noticing a trend that the feelings I may have had for them seem false and like they were never real feelings. I don #8217;t think I fell in love and fell out, I actually feel that I never cared so much for them as I wanted them to like me. Like, desperately. I may occasionally look these people up on social media, but I don #8217;t have any interest in contacting any of them. I look back at the lengths I used to try to earn the favor of some people, but I don #8217;t see the point in that exhaustion ever again. I have finally found a way to love and not to be desperate about it, but I am confused if I will someday question my past when my present has come and gone. I can almost taste my over rationalizing. So who here has similar thoughts, feelings, or anxieties like this? How do you manage them?</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I do this ALL THE TIME!! It #8217;s very difficult, and is made worse that I have fast, racing thoughts and am given to obsessively worrying about both the past and the future. The fast thoughts also just produce more time for me to dwell on things like that. I have an infinite regrets about many different choices I have made in life. People will say things like  #8220;Well that experience made you who you are today... #8221; That advice doesn #8217;t set well with me. When I become preoccupied with things that I cannot change (and this is far from easy), I try to think of the things that I did consider right for me and also focus on the things in the present that I am thankful for. Another, but less therapeutic way for me to deal with these things is to focus on the past negative decisions I have made and I try to bring into focus a plan that ensures that I won #8217;t make the same mistake again.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I wish! I have a bunch of other illnesses that can sometimes compromise my seizure threshold. But over the years, I might get a few months worth of brand name stuff (free for my old health plan) and had to switch cold turkey back to the generic. During the med changes, I never had any seizure or aura changes due to taking the off brand. In fact, the main way I stay seizure free for the longest is when I take a maintenance dose of Keppra and am given extras for a rescue remedy when I feel seizurrific and that usually prevents the seizures. My doctor told me that Keppra is really safe, so if need be I could just take one or even two of those.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I #8217;m rewatching this series for the third time . I don #8217;t mind at all. But I have a few notes: 1. Hannibal eats like, ALL THE TIME. How does he stay so slim? 2. Freddie Lounds (from the show) must be named Fredericka and Freddie is her nickname... but in the movie Silence of the Lambs, one of the women Buffalo Bill killed was named Fredericka Bimmel. A bit repetitive. 3. Hannibal says in an early season 1 that he does not lie... but a little while later, Will is having a meal with Hannibal and asked what the meat was. Hannibal immediately replied  #8220;pork. #8221; Pants on fire, Hannibal!</TEXT>

I guess my problems with that are if I could hang out with Hannibal, I would maybe eat whatever he feeds me... but I would want him to spill the beans so I could know what I #8217;m eating.

    <TITLE>Sugar triggering seizures?</TITLE>
    <DATE>2020-08-27 21:35:08</DATE>
    <TEXT>So, I have had epilepsy all of my life.., I #8217;m pretty well medicated to where I have a rare seizure. I love love love candy, and I #8217;m ashamed to say that I can really put away some candy. I feel fine for maybe a day, but then I begin to get very very shakey, feel a strong aura, and little  #8220;blips #8221; that are instants of sudden jerking movements, but not a full blown grand mal seizure. Sometimes I am so shakey and feel so close to having a seizure that I do not want to pick up my infant son. So, I #8217;m thinking that I have a glucose or blood sugar issue. I have no health insurance and we have very little money. I know I should stop eating candy, but there is a lot of other contributing factors to these times when I am super disposed to having seizures. What are some other things I can do to manage this? Could it all be from blood sugar issues? Any advice, suggestions, or experiences would be appreciated</TEXT>

I turned around and my husband had walked up very close behind me. I panicked for no reason but surprise, and all over I felt freezing cold, then burning hot. I got angry about him sneaking up on me, although he was not trying to, and I cursed and yelled at him. I immediately had an aura and had to go sit down. Though the whole incident was over in seconds, the aura stayed around for maybe 20 minutes. This is just one example, but the same thing happens all the time. At this point, my husband tried to announce his presence before I notice him.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>If it #8217;s something that you #8217;re not comfortable with, absolutely do not let your health be used as a humoring tool for others. While my mother didn #8217;t intend any ill will, she once told me that I did not have seizures unless I was doing drugs. She insisted that I didn #8217;t have epilepsy. So I stopped taking the meds that my neurologist prescribed (Keppra). Well, maybe four days later, a random driver found me convulsing on a road near my house after I had gone for a walk. If you want to indulge someone with trying holistic medicines, continue taking your prescribed medication, and ask your neurologist about the possibility of interactions between your prescribed meds and the holistic or natural approach that you are considering. For example, I occasionally use THC oil as a rescue remedy when I feel an aura, and it usually thwarts a seizure, but I did not use it until I had discussed it with my neurologist. As a person with a seizure disorder, please never consider stopping a prescribed medication or start a holistic approach to treatment until you have fully discussed it with a qualified doctor. There could be dire consequences.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>A lot of times, even in a grand mal or tonic clinic seizure, there is no apparent evidence determined by EEGs or doctor examination. I started having focal seizures as a very young child due to high fevers. They went away until I was 18-19 as grand mals. When I was pregnant, I had preeclampsia. I had two grand mal seizures while I was pregnant, and my OB refused to diagnose me with preeclampsia because I never had proteins in my urine, but I kept having high blood pressure (as high as 220/115). My high risk OB immediately diagnosed me me with preeclampsia despite that absence of proteins in urine and at 30 weeks gestation, my high risk OB admitted me to the hospital and they tried to get my blood pressure down. It didn #8217;t work, so they told me that my brain was swelling (encephalitis). It was so severe that at 30 weeks and 3 days, the doctors decided that it was way too dangerous for myself and my baby for me to continue carrying him. I had an emergency csection and my son was born at 3 pounds, 7 ounces. It was a long, difficult road, but after 72 days in the NICU, he was able to come home. Also, I took an anticonvulsant (approved by all of my doctors) while pregnant, and my son was not allowed to have my breast milk. Because he basically stopped ingesting the medication through my blood (while he was in my womb) he began having seizure like activity for the first two weeks or so of his life.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Okay, here #8217;s my opinion about this; it was taken from both my personal and professional experiences. I used to work with developmentally disabled adults. I was a one on one behavior assistant. My supervisor and I would get into debates sometimes about the terminology used to describe individuals with different disabilities. Our disagreements were mainly hinges on clinical terminology versus social outlooks on said terminology. My supervisor was of the mind that the word  #8220;retarded #8221; was an acceptable way to refer to the state of a developmentally disabled individual, because  #8220;mentally retarded #8221; was a clinical diagnosis. He said that he would not, however, condone the noun form of the word  #8220;retard. #8221; Obviously, I too was uncomfortable with the noun form of the word  #8220;retard, #8221; but I also did not appreciate using the word or words  #8220;retarded #8221; or  #8220;mentally retarded. #8221; The perception of these words may have been used long ago for clinical descriptions of certain disabilities, but I believe that over the years, these terms have evolved into being perverse and cruel. Because society has manipulated these words to bear negative connotations, they are simply unacceptable. I, myself, have a mental health condition, that while it is a clinically used word, I am not referred to as psychotic. With mental health disorders, society has through time recognized that there are many types of mental health, and has even begun to use the clinical diagnoses to describe the disorder or even the individual it affects. For people who are developmentally disabled, there are now numerous terms that can be used instead of the ones that have been twisted into obscene or offensive context. Now as we look at epilepsy, that is a clear clinical diagnosis. For now, epileptic is not yet a degrading term to an individual with epilepsy as it has not been said as an intended derogatory term. But people have sensitivities, opinions, and choices. Any person with epilepsy may or may not appreciate the term  #8220;epileptic, #8221; but that is his or her right to allow or not allow his or her self to be referenced as such. There is a bridge somewhere in both society #8217;s eye and the afflicted individuals where terminology can be twisted into a negative and both must decide the fate of a term used to describe someone. If it were up to me, I would prefer that any term used to describe a person or his/her disability or illness be completely up the those afflicted. Neuro-typical people may someday begin to be called  #8220;Normies, #8221; and while not incorrect, it may be looked at as a derogatory term. Acceptable terminology is all based on perception.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Hi. I was diagnosed with Juvenile Myoclonic Epilepsy too. It first presented as focal seizures between the ages of 1-3. They were usually accompanied by high fevers. The doctors said that I indeed had seizures, but did not diagnose me until age 19, because I began having grand mal seizures. I #8217;m 36 now and seizures play a big part in my life. I am a stay-at-home-mom and I have a 1.5 year old son and a husband. I haven #8217;t been able to drive for like 13 years. I have not had a real job in 13 years either. Before my license was taken away, I had 3 accidents in my car over a couple of years due to seizures, and all cars were totaled. I wish I could work from home some how, but I absolutely do not ever want to drive again. Every time I imagine driving, I have a horrible thought: what if my son was with me? Or my husband? Or if there was a car accident and I hurt someone else. I get a lot of weird epilepsy related stuff besides grand mals. I get  #8220;twitches, #8221; but I call them tics. Is can be embarrassing, but it #8217;s important to remember that it is a medical condition and that what you can #8217;t control, you may as well accept it as best as you can, try to get efficient meds, and be careful</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I stopped drinking after my husband asked me to. Anytime that I would indulge, a variety of crappy things would happen. The first being that I would either have a focal seizure and it would not be obvious or observed. I would black out for the entire duration of me drinking, and often longer than I drank (often a memory loss for2-3 days). No matter how much or how little I drank, I would get belligerent and make stupid choices, but the primary problem being I would not  #8220;be myself #8221; or retain any knowledge or memory of what occurred during the time I drank. Long ago, i thought that since alcohol was a downer that it would affect me like other downers and lower my chances of having a seizure. This was not the case at all; it just gave me poor decision making and stole all of my memory of the times I was drinking</TEXT>

The emergency room staff basically handed me a charcoal smoothie and tried to get me to drink it. Activated charcoal can often make one vomit, so it is given to OD individuals I hopes of making them purge whatever they ingested. I would probably avoid ingesting charcoal (for ANYONE with a medicated health condition) because you very likely could barf up your medication, nulling the intended effect of the medication taken.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Just gonna day real quick that the best way to make yourself have a seizure is to take an anticonvulsant med and then to stop it cold turkey. May as well ask Santa for a seizure for Christmas. Another thing to consider is this: I have seen plenty of people have seizures. Other people, that is. I have never seen a video or anything else of myself having a seizure. There #8217;s a good bit of denial that can come with never having witnessed an occurrence that essentially happened to the witnesses of it, but one that you are unable to see or imagine happening to yourself. For me, I downplay it whenever I have a seizure, and I often don #8217;t know I am doing it. I #8217;m basically in denial. I #8217;m never going to understand how scary it is for a loved one or even a stranger/bystander to witness and deal with me having a seizure. There #8217;s a part of my intellect somewhere that will not accept that my seizures are anything comparable to the seizures of other folks that I have seen in person or on video. It #8217;s just hard to imagine such actually happening to me... so in my mind, it #8217;s almost as if it didn #8217;t really occur. What #8217;s the thing I most often say when I regain consciousness and someone tells me that I had a seizure?  #8220;No I didn #8217;t, #8221; is what I usually say</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I take Keppra and several mental health prescriptions. I only smoke rarely, but having smoked often for previous years I found out the hard way that some strains are not good for me. I #8217;m unable to know which ones. I do know that smoking non-cannabinoids like spice can really do bad things to me. That #8217;s a one-way trip to seizure land. MDMA is also a sure fire way to have seizures. I know that because once our dealer  #8220;accidentally #8221; dusted our weed with MDMA, or ecstasy. I barely made it out of that experience alive. Anyways, I #8217;m out state it is legal with a  #8220;low-thc card #8221; to use 5% THC oil for my condition(s). It helps a lot with seizures. On the other hand, recreational smoking of marijuana has upsides and downsides. If you are getting it from a dispensary and you know that what you are getting is real and not tainted with something that could mess you up, great. If not, tread with caution.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I have Aspbergers, bipolar disorder, epilepsy, severe anxiety, and severe depression. I just recently developed high blood pressure so I take meds for that as well as a diuretic. For whatever reason, my body develops tolerances for meds super fast, so it is a never ending battle to stay ahead of my myriad of symptoms. I seldom skip doses, but I frequently experience multiple symptoms. I don #8217;t know how severe or frequently that you experience symptoms, but let me tell you, realistically, that it does not get easier. Your body will get older. You will get weaker. You will, over time, develop different health concerns that will require life changes and/or meds. If you are yo-yoing your body with taking meds and sometimes not taking meds, you are essentially not allowing your body to physically adjust to medication. Your body will not like this. Your symptoms will not get better over time or disappear. However, if you continuously take the medications that you have been prescribed, your body will likely do like mine has, and over time, your body will acclimate to the medication and you will eventually need different or more of the same medication. Without sounding abysmal, as soon as you are born, you start dying. Medicine and medication and surgery are simply ways of prolonging the inevitable. If you want to stick around, you allow qualified physicians to dabble in some or multiple of these areas.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I #8217;m positive that smoking weed affects each person in a different way. One of the reasons of this is the chemical tolerance of individuals #8217; brains. That #8217;s why some people can smoke a whole bowl and have less of a high than someone who only has a couple of hits. The medication that you take can also have varying effects. As for me, I have learned over the years that any downers usually prevent my seizures, for the most part (not including alcohol). Uppers for me have the opposite effect; they make my seizure threshold much more susceptible to being broken. I #8217;m pretty sure that I have never had a seizure when or around when I was smoking. However, a general rule of thumb is that if you cold turkey stop any medicine of any kind that help to prevent seizures, stopping the use of that can trigger seizures. I take Xanax for anxiety and if I stop taking even a small maintenance dose, I will have a seizure. If I stop taking any of my meds (prescribed for different reasons), I can just about guarantee that I will have a seizure. Anything that enters your body usually over time will be sorely missed in a physiological way by your body. There are doctors in my state that prescribe a legal form of low-THC oil for the very purpose of minimizing seizures. In my personal opinion, THC actually prevents seizures (for me), but as I mentioned, every persons body chemistry is different.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I was 9 when I was molested by a family member. I told my mother, she reported it to police, and my abuser went to jail (for a much shorter sentence due to good behavior). I was evaluated by a psychologist and he reportedly told my mother that had little to no trauma. Maybe that was true in the beginning, because little about me changed right away. In fact it was others #8217; attitudes towards me that changed, even if they didn #8217;t take notice. After a few years, around age 12 and up, I do remember flirting with a boy much older than I, and we became secret boyfriend and girlfriend. He was probably 19. It seemed, looking back, that he may have been grooming me for his own lascivious purposes, but eventually graduated and left the school. From then on was a troubled  #8220;love #8221; life that left me flirting or seeking the attention from males much older than I. Also, in the relationships between me and older males, I had an irrational want or need for their approval and affections. There were times that I went to great lengths above and beyond my personal morality or limits in order to gain any tiny hint of appreciation or approval. It was a very long time before I was able to look back and face what happened to me as a girl. It was like it was impossible to identify with  #8220;that girl #8221; who was molested and the person I had become from then to present. For most of my life, I would seek the attention of older males and i abhorred the idea of me having a relationship with any men even a little younger than I. It wasn #8217;t until my present self confronted and accepted  #8220;the girl #8221; who was molested. Eventually I was able to unite those two entities and I forgave my abuser (not to his face, just in my mind) that I was finally able to have a relationship not with an older male and not for the explicit need of winning favor or approval of whomever I had a relationship with. I do, however, still catch myself attempting to earn the approval of most people I am exposed to throughout my life. It #8217;s an endless battle that I have with myself to seek my own happiness as well as the happiness of others.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I was 9 when I was molested by a not-very-close family member. I was embarrassed by it and thought it was absolutely my fault. One day I tentatively told my bff and she told me that I needed to tell my mom. I did, we made a police report, my family member went to trial. I was heartbroken that my abuser #8217;s sister and mother first tried to get me not to testify. They were my grandma and great grandma. My relationship with them took many years to recover. My abuser received a jail sentence of like 8 years, but he got released in like 4 years due to good behavior. I was seen by a licensed psychologist who reported to my mother that I had no indication of PTSD, but as time went on, it was quite clear that I had a whole lot of PTSD. When my abuser got out of jail there was an order mandated that he and I could not be within 500 feet of each other and if I went into a building that he was already in, he had to leave, not me. All of this took place right after it happened. He eventually got old and died. I have finally forgiven him, though it is really not helpful to the trauma that I experienced. However, I am very thankful that charges were pressed and that he served some kind of judgement for his acts because it was not the first time he had done it, and I was not the first person he had molested, but to the best of my knowledge, I was the last person he abused.</TEXT>

I told one person at school (not the bff I mentioned) in the fourth grade. The very next morning, every single other student knew. They asked me tough questions, like was I raped and was it a family member. I have always had trouble making friends, but after this ordeal I was ostracized even more so than before. My grandma and great grandma and great aunts stopped speaking to me for years. Everyone else treated me like a bird with a broken wing: I had become very much a victim and other people seemed to respect me less and also seemed to accept any emotions I showed to be dramatic left over spillage from my abuse.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Let me add that I was not physically raped, but pretty much everything but. For a very short time when my abuser went to jail, I was placed in a group with other girls around my age (7-12). Most of the other girls had actually been forcibly raped. I felt very bad for these girls, but also kind of separated, as if I shouldn #8217;t be there because what happened to them was worse. I cannot recall if any of these girls vocalized that, or if was purely my paranoia and low self esteem. The group actually had books made for children that showed the anatomy of women and men. Because of what did and didn #8217;t happen to me, I took an interest in these books. As I got older, it seemed that I had a fervent aspiration to get older males to like me. My desperate need for approval still rages on, and despite years and years of therapy, my self esteem is still utterly low and I often catch myself trying to please others rather than standing up for my own rights.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>If you have any OCD, rhymes can be dually fun and very hard work! On the bright side, if I have zero motivation or inspiration, thinking of some random word that I really like often spurs me on to find rhymes for that word and build poems around it. Oops... now that I #8217;m thinking of it, the word doesn #8217;t have to rhyme with anything to inspire oneself into writing a poem or building around it.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I'm convinced that now I should leave the Earth, Because my life's been wrong ever since my birth. There isn't much that could make me stay, I go unnoticed anyway. But what other world to should I go, If no place could tell me no? Mercury is not my first choice; The sun so close it burns my voice. Venus seems to be a bit beckoning, And Mars a hell of red reckoning. Jupiter's berth is so big and wide! Saturn's rings make me feel trapped inside! I can't live on Uranus, I'm afraid Because its orbit is retrograde. I don't want to live in Neptune's blue, It's atmosphere too rich a hue. Once upon a different time, Pluto was thought to be planet nine, But suddenly to all it morphed, Not a planet, but a dwarf. Eris was quite considered the same, In myth a subject of discord and pain. Eris around it has one known moon, Dysnomia's name is forgotten soon, Because it is a memory flaw, These two outcasts from the sun withdraw. So the moon forgetful and the planet of strife, What a perfect place to spend my life! This destination, so far away and cold, My isolation will at least be controlled.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>PTSD: Post Traumatic Stress Disorder. It sounds that your stress is due to trauma that happened in your past, thus the  #8220;post #8221; part is correct. By strict definition, I would say that it does seem that you would or could be diagnose with PTSD, pending a doctor #8217;s diagnosis. Most people who have trauma in their past can be traced to or defined as PTSD, the question lies in what other diagnosis or diagnoses that you may also qualify for. For example, panic attacks are a diagnosis... but if you can see/hear/taste/smell/feel visuals, sounds, flavors, scents, or physical feelings directly stemming from trauma, emotion, reaction, or perception, there may indeed be other symptoms or conditions present and/or unaccounted for.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I know this whole situation sucks. I #8217;m sorry. I myself have had 4 car accidents due to seizures. 3 of them were completely totaled. Once I crashed into a ditch and totaled my nice Camaro. Once I seized before a stop sign that would have kept me from being T-boned by another car. The last time I seized and crashed into an empty building at a community college. In all of the wrecks, I was the only one hurt, and although some resulted in concussions or a broken nose, I was largely unharmed. It #8217;s been around 14 years since I have worked or had a license. Not being able to drive is inconvenient for me and my family, having all of those wrecks was expensive and stressful, but nothing is worse than coming back to consciousness after a accident-resulting seizure to the numb-yet-sore feeling and seeing broken glass, blood, and wondering desperately if someone else was hurt. After all these years, I now have a almost 2 year old son... I am not exaggerating when I say that I never ever want to drive again. Convenience and freedom aside, I do not want to have someone I care about or someone I don #8217;t even know put in danger or worse. There is a good side to not driving. I have no idea of I will ever be able to drive legally again, but because I cannot ever be certain that I won #8217;t have a seizure, it feels to be too big of a risk to jeopardize lives and wellbeing.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>So years ago (after my license was taken away due to a resulting accident during a seizure), I was walking anywhere from 3 to 9 miles a day, for weight loss every single day. Oddly enough, I got hit by a speeding car with no seizure activity, just someone who was being careless. I recovered fine. But one day, I went for my daily walk and bam! I #8217;m waking up with paramedics over me and one lonely bystander who had called the medics when he found me in the middle of the road seizing! It was right after a left turn onto another road, so I was very lucky that he didn #8217;t hit me while he was driving. This was years ago, but I #8217;m wondering: what all could I carry or wear that would inform strangers that I have seizures and to not call an ambulance? I mean, unless there is an apparent injury.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Here is my humble opinion after reading all of the Thomas Harris books, watching all the movies, and watching the series, all to completion. Dolarhyde never thought of any one act that he could do that would transform him to the dragon. In his own mind, the Red Dragon was already within him, and that it was growing with each of his murders. It is suggested that the Dragon was an alternate personality or even being, perhaps, and that when he committed his murders, he would  #8220;transform #8221; completely into the Dragon while he killed his victims and sexually assaulted the women or matriarchs. The symbolism of him smashing mirrors come from the part of Francis that is Francis himself, due to his imagination of his disfigurement. Once the mirrors are smashed and he kills his victims and places the mirror fragments in their eyes, he  #8220;transforms #8221; into the Dragon, as the victims appear alive to him with the fragmented mirrors to  #8220;see #8221; the Dragon. As the Dragon, he sexually abuses the women. Perhaps the women, then being molested, essentially became  #8220;The Woman Clothed with the Sun, #8221; as in the painting that so greatly intrigued Dolarhyde. He is indeed, in his mind, transforming not only himself into the Red Dragon, but also the victims. He even says (in the book and the movie) to Freddy Lounds, that the victims are  #8220;changing. #8221; With each murder committed by Francis, he seems to be  #8220;becoming #8221; more and more the Dragon, rather than Francis. When Francis shared a relationship with Reba, he began to have a version of sentimental feelings for her, and the Dragon within him wanted to  #8220;change #8221; her. Francis was becoming acquainted with sharing a real, human relationship and enjoyed it to the point that he wanted to try to rebuke the Dragon, and even tried to by rushing to the museum and literally eating the painting of  #8220;The Great Red Dragon and The Woman Clothed with The Sun. #8221; Unfortunately for Francis, he loses his faith in Reba by seeing her coworker and her interacting and he feels betrayed. He gets the message from Hannibal that he has been discovered, so Francis sets up a situation with Reba that leaves her believing that he committed suicide so that Will would be drawn close and left exposed. This was in hopes that the Red Dragon (whom Francis now again wants to become) that Francis could continue his transformation to become the Dragon fully, possibly making Francis invincible to the pains and woes of his life. It was never insinuated that Francis believed that he would totally become the Dragon if he were to kill Will. Will had become a threat to Francis #8217; existence and therefore threatened the Dragon #8217;s possession of Francis. Will, therefore, was not so much a catalyst for Francis to become the Dragon, just a roadblock that must be squashed and another murder that would transpire and eventually transform Francis into the Dragon. While each murder and  #8220;changing #8221; of individuals took place continued to transform Francis, there was no single action that would totally transform him at once.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Just a thought here: I have been on Keppra for 17 years. I have been told by many doctors that Keppra can also treat anxiety, depression, mood disorder, and more... But the axe doesn #8217;t really fall for no reason. I am bipolar, among other things. I possibly had the Keppra rage stuff, but with my complicated diagnosis, I #8217;m more apt to believe that Keppra made me feel that way because I had underlying issues that were not being treated. For example, someone who is bipolar and is treated with an antidepressant, that person will likely experience mania, which can present itself in many many ways. Also, the only good way to help your doctor understand your feelings is to have a journal of these symptoms and to document every facet of your questionable feelings and reactions. Document with time, date, and a detailed description of the feelings, verbal expression, and actions. Hopefully when it is presented to the doctor and he/she will be able to identify a pattern and make a diagnosis or decision that will be treated or otherwise be accommodated.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>The best thing I have found for those times is to pop an extra anticonvulsant to ride out the time remaining that I absolutely have to be awake. To be clear, don #8217;t do that against or without a doctor #8217;s advice. I #8217;m only on Keppra for my seizures, and I have discussed this plan with my doctors. They did indeed give me the green light to take an additional Keppra if needed to try to avoid having a seizure when I feel that it is a likelihood. It usually helps or works, but you shouldn #8217;t make a habit of it because your body could become dependent upon those extra anticonvulsants.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Hi. I am sorry for your troubles, first of all. I want to start this text by saying that unless you decide so, there is no prerequisite that a person be in a romantic relationship at all. If you want a romantic relationship, I would visit a dating website and fill out a profile with whatever you feel comfortable saying. If you do not want a romantic relationship, say so. If you want a relationship tone romantic but to not include physical intercourse, say that. I think it will definitely decrease the number of interested applicants you obtain, but by stating whatever you are looking for, you lay out some regulations of what your potential partners will or would expect from you and the potential relationship. If your goal is to eventually have a relationship that includes sexual intimacy, that is different. To feel comfortable with sexual intimacy, maybe try on your own before you risk the intimacy with a person that you can #8217;t immediately trust. Kinda like swimming, for example. I wouldn #8217;t want to swim with anyone else unless I first knew how to swim. Why? Because I #8217;d fear the other person would judge me. But if I #8217;m confident enough to swim by myself without failure, then I would have more chance to enjoy swimming with a partner. If the bottom line is that you are uncomfortable or uncertain that you will ever enjoy sex, there is nothing wrong with that. Unfortunately our society places immense pressure on a person to be sexually active, but that is not an expectation that you have to live up to. The priority is to convince yourself that the expectations that are set need to be set by yourself.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>So I was on a second or third date in an ill fated relationship. I had already been without a job or license for a few years due to seizures, so it was hard getting rides to my boyfriend #8217;s house. His apartment had a nice pool, so my brother and his roommate went down to swim. I felt fine, no aura, nothing... so I went to stand by the pool #8217;s shallow end. The next thing I know is that I had a towel around my shoulders and I was shivering. My bf was showing me up to the apartment, and I felt super guilty and confused. After my zombie phase, they told me that I reached to touch the water and suddenly couldn #8217;t look away from the sun shining off the water. I promptly fell into the water and began seizing in the water. I was a bit overweight, so the roommate jumped in to hold my head above water while my bf tried to pull me up out of the pool! It turned out that the family who were also swimming saw the whole thing, but they didn #8217;t speak English, so they didn #8217;t understand when we explained it. To this day, I don #8217;t remember much, or how long I was incapacitated. The guilt I felt was likely because I felt like a party pooper, getting ready to swim and then ruining it for everyone. Then of course my embarrassing knowledge that I was so overweight that it took two skinny guys to get me out of the pool (note: I wasn #8217;t uber overweight, just not medium). Following all of that, I of course had to sleep it off and was never invited back to swim due to the precedent that I was very seizure prone and more trouble than I was worth.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I have been diagnosed and taking Keppra since age 19; I #8217;m 36 now. I #8217;m not sure when it started, but my memory has gone to shit. I can watch and pay attention to any movie one week, with my husband, no distractions. Unfortunately, one to two weeks later, I will beg him for us to watch that same movie again, and HAVE ABSOLUTELY NO RECOLLECTION of ever having seen the movie. It #8217;s really weird. I can remember fragments of long, long ago, like the tiny glimpses I can remember from my 1st birthday (just a few images and tastes), but I straight flush memories that are recent. It #8217;s been like this for years. People that I converse with regularly are annoyed, offended, just think I #8217;m damned dumb when I start telling them something that I (maybe) have said to them already (one or more times). Worse than that, people think that when I can #8217;t remember things, that I just didn #8217;t think those moments or topics were very important. It #8217;s sad enough that I can #8217;t remember things that involve me, but my dysfunctional memory causes other people #8217;s feelings to get hurt? I don #8217;t want to lie and behave as if I do remember stuff that I actually don #8217;t. I also don #8217;t want to give every person I meet a gentle disclosure that I may or may not have any recollection of any conversations or other interactions we may or may not have for an unseen amount of time.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I have a suggestion. Write 2 separate poems. One from the point of view which denies being abused, one from the point of view which admits it. Read both until you get a pretty good understanding of both. When you feel like you have both of them easily recalled, write a third. With this third poem, write how you feel about those two poems. Whether you decide to write one poem about the similarities of both people or about the difference of both people, you may stand a chance at some measure of acceptance.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>This is me. Totally. Except I don #8217;t necessarily have to have a seizure to forget things. Like, I can watch a movie with my husband, a week passes and I beg to watch the movie, but he tells me that we already watched it and I have no recollection of it. I forget things I need to buy from a store, I forget that I told people some thing more than once, or who I told it to, or to finish chores (like laundry). I have JME, and my memory just seems to be getting worse. I have always taken Keppra for my seizures, but I #8217;m led to believe that that #8217;s not the reason I #8217;m so forgetful. Maybe it has to do with head injuries I #8217;ve sustained because of seizures. The weirdest part is that my long-term memory is fantastic. I can remember a few glimpses, sounds, and tastes from my first birthday. I can remember conversations my best friend and I had around age 7. I remember well my great great grandma letting me watch scary movies during nap time, and she died when I was 5. I remember nursery rhymes I learned with my great grandma... and unfortunately, having a good long term memory also means that you must take the sour with the sweet. I remember when I was 4 or 5 and my mom slapped me in the face for saying something really snotty. I remember worse stuff that happened that I wish I could forget. Yet I will vehemently deny conversations or events that happened pretty recently, and even with someone gently reminding me of whatever doesn #8217;t even spark deja vu or anything. I just take it in stride, and make lots of notes on my phone about everything that I may need to remember. It is a pain in the ass, but that #8217;s how I manage... the thing that nothing will help, though, is the disappointment I feel when I notice that my forgetfulness hurts someone I care about. And it #8217;s also difficult to maintain relationships when the other party has to face that I forget so much. They usually get tired of me and move on</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Hey. Just wanted to say that I #8217;ve never known a mother to be the mother that she wanted to be. That being said, you #8217;re already way on the way to being a mother with some sentiment of goodness since you have a goal in mind/at heart. I never wanted kids. Never ever. But as soon as I found out I was pregnant, I already had a goal-motherhood in wait of my fulfillment. Motherhood is like anything you grow into: it #8217;s never what you expect, never just as you want it, and there are an infinity of things that you didn #8217;t imagine or account for. Some of us simply decide that we don #8217;t want to make the mistakes that our parents made, but shit. Once you become a mother (or even just parent), you will soon learn that there are a million places that you will fail where others succeeded, and vice versa! Focus on what you would like to achieve and you #8217;re already on your way. One thing I would advise? Enjoy every little tiny moment of bonding that you can with your spawn. Laugh, cry, smile, make funny faces, and learn that even silence can be a conversation.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Hang in there. My mom believed me and we prosecuted. But my grandma told me that I brought it (the abuse) on myself. I was grown when she told me that, but the abuse occurred when I was 9 years old. (Another surprise? My grandma was abused the same way by a family member too, when she was 5...) Fact is: I was pissed at my grandma, and I didn #8217;t speak to her for a couple of years after that, but we got close again before she died. I wouldn #8217;t change any of it. The hurt for me, the disparaging ambivalence that she had to deal with, how we never talked about it again, us becoming close again before she died, the whole shebang. Things don #8217;t change just because you want them to... and in the end, chances are that they happen to fall into place. EDIT: I am so very sorry that you are having to deal with this on your own. I was way too young to face my abuse and abuser alone, but if you have to report and/or press charges alone, please, please do it. Do it for yourself, do it because people are abused all the time without reporting it, and do it for all of the people that your abuser will ever have the opportunity to hurt in the future.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I tried to get disability in Florida. From what I understand, Florida is one of the states in which it is more difficult to get. To qualify for disability, I had to have an EEG, an MRI, and a diagnosis from my doctor stating my condition. I was denied disability because my EEG did not disclose a seizure (as in I needed to have a seizure happening on record of the EEG). For whatever reason, during my EEG, I did not have a seizure. I did have an MRI and the doctors diagnosis. Apparently, dozens of reported seizures as well as hospital records, ambulance trips, and 2 life flights over the years did not deem me able to qualify as having a debilitating epilepsy condition. I had to pay out of pocket (had no insurance) for the EEG, the MRI, and the doctor visits. I literally was worse off after applying for disability than before. Also, though I had a lawyer, the judge army hearing literally said that  #8220;If (I) could lift 50 pounds and walk, I was not disabled. #8221;</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Edit: I just realized that I didn #8217;t even respond to your poem. The imagery you used to describe anxiety is right on point. The metaphor I like the most was about the broken shards of glass. This work really captures an essence of how anxiety can attack someone and not just have mental anguish, but physical symptoms that do all but crush those who suffer it. Included is a poem of my own that I did on the same subject matter. I think yours is much more raw and relatable. My OCD dictates that I HAVE to rhyme my poetry. Please read it and let me know what sounds real and what is too controlled by my rhyming parameters. I did one about anxiety too. It #8217;s below. Anxiety I see you're back again, And soon you will begin Always taking more than you need, Always trying to make a heart bleed. There's so much of me that you've already wasted, There's so much of life that I haven't tasted Because of your taunting and pushing me around, I'm tumbling and trembling and falling down. You're choking me, I cannot breathe. I'm so ashamed, and I can hardly believe That you've got me again in your deep hell, I #8217;m trying so hard but you can #8217;t really tell. All my efforts are wasted fighting this war, How many times have I been here before? I'm struggling to break free of anxiety's grip, But it's bleeding me dry, drip by drip. I won't give up, I won't stop fighting, Relentlessly I will still be denying That you can take anything else away from me You don't see it yet, but someday you'll see! Hey</TEXT>

    <TEXT>A few years ago, I would speed walk 3-9 miles a day, literally. I would do it rain or shine, every single day without fail. I thought I was doing it for weight loss, but really I just did it to get out of the house (I have epilepsy and lost my driver #8217;s license). It took me a very long time to stop worrying about people watching me. This was a rural neighborhood, but had a very high traffic of commuters and truckers. The only way I found to not be panicking inside of my head fretting about being observed was to get an MP3 player, load it with at least 300 songs, don on my earbuds, and basically delve completely into my own thoughts or the music. I would avert my eyes from the faces of neighbors, motorists, and whoever else. I also got a fancy fitness watch, and the number figures of my distance, speed, calories burned, etc, and I paid constant attention to the numbers for each detail. For me, it was never about letting go of my fear of people watching me, it was more about creating distractions for my mind to focus on more. With as many distracting factors I built for myself, I eventually was able to focus on my walk, music, fitness watch features, and my own thoughts rather than the unending flow of people who I believed were simply watching me. I hope this helps</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Hi. I #8217;ve been taking Keppra for 19 years. I currently have fluctuating energy/ exhaustion, but I don #8217;t so much think it #8217;s the Keppra. As I am beginning to notice, my exhaustion is much more prevalent a little while after a meal. At first we thought it was my blood pressure, which it was, and my doctor put me on a high blood pressure med. After a while, the phases of total exhaustion began again, and I have not been able to go to the doctor to find out anything, but we are beginning to think now that it may have more to do with my blood sugar. I don #8217;t want to go out on a limb and say that I think Keppra made me have high blood pressure, but I suspect just a little bit that it may have somehow altered my blood sugar.

    <TEXT>Hello. I wanted to say just one quick thing. Before I was diagnosed, I worked for 6 years at a day training facility for mentally and/or physical handicaps. At first I was a training instructor, the was promoted to art teacher, and then promoted to a Behavior Assistant one-on-one for clients who had very severe maladaptive behaviors like physical aggression, self injurious behavior, property destruction, and more. I never quit the job; I had a car accident due to epilepsy and lost my driving privileges and finally I was unable to even work. I never did fit in with the other staff members, but I had a very good relationship with most of the clients who attended. There were many people attending with whom I actually considered my close friends. I never had any feelings of our  #8220;statuses #8221; being different or anything like that. I made a big effort to treat all of the students as my equals, nothing less or more. I only wanted to tell you that there are some people out there who don #8217;t see a disparaging difference from  #8220;normal functioning #8221; people and people with handicaps. I #8217;m not saying this out of pride, but I always felt it necessary and respectful to approach all of the clients there as equal citizens. I feel like that should be a non discriminatory attitude to develop and maintain with ALL individuals. I hated seeing some of the other staff talking down to our students. Just know that there are some people who care and do not allow any disabilities or other things that identify an individual as unique.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>No, you did an awesome job. It does look like him, and the only difference in your drawing is that he appears just a little bit younger, maybe, or that you caught him in a very flattering pose! Way to go! Now draw Mason Verger post-trauma</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I have a 17 year old cat that I #8217;ve had all her life. She literally sleeps in my arms, and under the covers. I spoon her, basically. She is getting very old and we kind of have a codependency. I anticipate that when she passes away, I #8217;m not going to have even a chance to sleep without her in my arms. I have planned on getting a stuffed animal to hug up on when the time comes</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Think of it as a challenge with a little bit of leeway for some personal creativity. Not sure if you know the whole story of the series yet, so I #8217;ll try not to spoil it, but Mason Verger has very... unique features, let #8217;s say. Try not to think about drawing him as a male. I have trouble drawing men, too, but if I try to draw a particular person, I try to not really be mindful of the subject #8217;s gender until I have a decent sketch, then I erase the more feminine curvy lines and replace them with slightly more angular lines</TEXT>

    <DATE>2020-10-15 19:14:58</DATE>
    <TEXT>It's been a while since I've seen me, I've only seen what I wanted to see. Don't look at reflections, just walk on by, I cannot look and I don't know why... Unless it's because I just go unseen, Though I'm spotless, I don't feel clean. Do passers-by even notice me there I'm invisible not matter how long they stare. My transparency has been my life saving grace, And by now I've forgotten my face. The weight of the world rests on my frail back, I'm unseen but I always feel under attack! And one day, I will approach a glass mirror, So much of life will be suddenly clearer! I will gaze upon that face stares with empty eyes, Knowing that she cannot perceive my surprise To finally see a person who resembles me, But which one of us is free? Is it she who is staring from within, Can I help her become human again? I decide to rescue her, no matter what it may take, I plan to somehow make this mirror break! So I hurriedly fetch a large smooth stone, Excited that I would not ever be alone! So I forcibly chunked the stone into the mirror, It shattered and fell before I considered That a mirror breaks and becomes more than one, And in each partial mirror, I can see someone. The mirror pieces, each and every one, Is a new me, and each is someone In each now broken glass shards that remain Have trapped witin pain. The broken mirrors each have a reflection The mirroperfection . I began to weep and despite my chagrin, I picked up a mirror shard and climbed right in.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I would at least begin getting comfortable with your body by yourself. It #8217;s something that most people either never do, or don #8217;t start trying to do until they are judging themselves with another person #8217;s point of view, which is selling yourself short. Do your homework by yourself and figure out what you like and don #8217;t. Once you have done that, and decided what you prefer as far as physical pleasure. Then, if you have a trusted and (to you) attractive person, before engaging in sexual activity, verbally discuss your boundaries, comforts, preferences, and insecurities, just so that there are no surprises.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I agree with the poster who said to not stop medications cold turkey. As for driving... well, I #8217;ve totaled three cars just from seizures. Trust me, it is way easier to choose not to drive until all health concerns are squared away. Please trust this; you don #8217;t want someone you care about or even a stranger to wake up in a wrecked car wondering whose blood is everywhere and if anyone else was injured... I #8217;ve been without a license for like 13 years and now I have a young son. I #8217;m all the time fearful that the people around me will bully me into getting my license soon and I am petrified of driving with my son in the car. Take things slow, asking your son for his feelings and concerns about his condition.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>If I were to give any advice, and this may already be your game plan, but for sure try to be as honest as possible, even if some topics of conversation are things you aren #8217;t ready to discuss. Actually, ESPECIALLY be honest if a topic comes up that you aren #8217;t prepared to communicate about. Try to enjoy yourself, and don #8217;t beat yourself up if you think you have said some awkward; in my experience it was usually more me being over critical of myself. I don #8217;t know how socially developed you are, but if you have anxiety about saying anything that will be interpreted wrongly, go with your gut to decide whether to explain your words or to wait for the questions you receive about a specific topic. Good luck! Have fun!</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I like this a lot. I think I wrote one saying something very similar and everyone just up and thinks that I #8217;ll do something really permanent because of the poems I write. Here #8217;s one, if you #8217;d like to read it Why am I so easy to throw away, It may seem like coincidence, But it happens every day I used to think it was everyone else, I never considered it was myself Who perpetuated sorrow and pain I never considered I wasn't sane! But for all the trouble and sacrifice, My heart is frozen, made of ice! I never found who was to blame For making my heart so hard to tame. Dimly lit by a darken sun, The fight within me rages on. I look into the fractured sky I can't see past these tears, and wonder why. I feel so scared and all alone; Does my heart even have a home? Where did all my promises go, The ones I made to myself? I'm so alive but have no hope, My screams are not for help. Of all the sorrows I have seen I still don't know what my dreams mean... But if they are so foretell our fate, I'm sorry, self, but it's too late. I step into the water so very cold, Soon numbness will set in, I'm told. I take some steps and plunge right in, My body panics and lungs begin To shudder and quake, not that it matters, My soup breaks free and begins to shatter. My hair is drifting around my eyes, I'll no longer have to live the lies. My hair is floating around my face, I'm being led to a different place. I used to fight and want to win But me I'm slowly giving in. I'm paralyzed but completely aware I look in the mirror and no ones there.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>It #8217;s all about how you feel! Is there one poem that you truly think that you rocked, or is there maybe one that you deeply and personally identify with? If you are considering memorizing your work, maybe try to memorize just one at first. Your favorite one. Then see if it is agreeable to you. As for myself, I write so much stuff that I can #8217;t remember much of them and I do what you said that you do: just barf up my feelings all in a scrawled and raw manner. I feel that poetry is a lot more relatable if it #8217;s done from the heart, but at the same time, if you read it over even one time with a fresh mindset, it can absolutely show you changes that could be made to improve your work, but you can still preserve the heartfelt essence that was created in the original. What messes me up is reading, re-reading, and are-reading with changes each time. That right there seems to really warp the whole work into something that my heart didn #8217;t feel, but my overthinking conjured it up. It doesn #8217;t feel real after too many re-writes</TEXT>

    <TEXT>First off, let me just say that I #8217;m sorry you have to go through that. I #8217;m 36 and have been taking Keppra for 19 years. I have a weird weird memory.. To this day, I can remember glimpses, tastes, and feelings from my 1st birthday party. I can remember lots of stuff in detail from forever ago... But if my husband and I watch a movie together, I straight up forget it. Movies, series, places we eat at, trips to the store, chores that needed to be done, conversations I #8217;ve had, all of those memories go right down the toilet. I have even gotten into arguments, insisting that I have not done this or said that. When I meet new people in real life or on the internet, whatever, I go ahead and introduce myself and say a little disclaimer about my awful memory and try to explain, because people get frustrated when you can never remember stuff... especially stuff that meant a lot to the other person. It sucks, and I don #8217;t know if this is related to my medication, my seizures, or maybe from numerous head concussions I #8217;ve had. Maybe a combination of any or all of the above.. I just know that it sucks, and that at least I #8217;ll never get tired of watching the same movie dozens of times</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Yes, sometimes. I used to be the opposite, as in more enthusiastic and involved than my partner... And nowadays, I do sometimes disassociate, but pretty much because my partner now has in the past said some mean things, so sometimes my participation and involvement with the sexual activity just kind of fades away. I guess I #8217;m just emotional and stuff, but words hurt, and they matter</TEXT>
