It #8217;s over Then suddenly there #8217;s an upload. The screen is dark and then Pewdiepie pops up and says  #8220;meme review #8221; There #8217;s Mark and Ethan and they spend the whole time looking at the subreddit and the memes and fan art. That #8217;s the only video that stays posted.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>My friend has had a crush on someone for over 4 years. She #8217;s very shy and has never done anything about it. After lots of help from myself and 3 other friends she finally decided she #8217;d do something. She went to a run (they #8217;re on every Saturday at 8am in the park/forest) because he usually goes. He found out if she was going and they talked about it. Honestly we all thought that #8217;s the most that would ever happen. She went anyway and before she asked him to get coffee he asked her out. They #8217;re going out in a few hours. Everyone #8217;s so happy for them. Even if it takes almost 5 years apparently things can work out.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I have a thought. Okay so you hear adults tell you to be happy because your teen years are  #8220;the best years you ever have #8221; but I don #8217;t agree with that. If you are Hating life right now or are struggling then believing these are the best years you have isn #8217;t true. Because you think that these years when you feel like shit all the time is the best it #8217;ll get and it will be worse as you get older. So no. They aren #8217;t always the best years. You mightn #8217;t have your best years for a while. Don #8217;t tell people to just  #8220;be happier #8221; because it just makes things worse. Wow why didn #8217;t I think of just being happier now I #8217;m so much better I love life. That #8217;s not how it works</TEXT>

    <TEXT> #8226; panic buying is helping no one. Yes if you are in isolation you need supplies. Buying 18 packets of toilet paper is not necessary. You will only be at home for a few weeks so all this does is stop others from buying it when they need it. I believe this stems from the fear that the virus causes diarrhea which it does not. So please stop talking all the supplies  #8226; stop saying it #8217;s just the flu. Yes it doesn #8217;t affect us like most people because of our age. But it #8217;s new. No one else is immune, unlike the flu. Your attitude only spreading germs. If you #8217;re not washing your hands often because  #8220;it #8217;s just the flu #8221; then yeah you probably won #8217;t get it but others can and they could die. Wash you me goddamn hands  #8226; everyone is happy schools are closed. This is a reminder to do your work that #8217;s online. This isn #8217;t vacation. Janitors, school nurses, secretary #8217;s, are most likely not being payed (this may vary by area) so schools closing isn #8217;t always good. It #8217;s great that action is being taken but the reason it has to be done isn #8217;t for you to have weeks off school to relax  #8226; if you are an exam year and are worried about your future I am so sorry. I hope this gets sorted soon and that you can continue  #8226; research. There is lots of fake tips and advice online. Check what #8217;s being said. Your safety is important. You also have a responsibility to keep others safe. Remember this</TEXT>

    <TITLE>Saint Patrick #8217;s day</TITLE>
    <DATE>2020-03-17 10:52:23</DATE>
    <TEXT>18 years ago my parents lost a child, every year it still affects them. St. Patrick #8217;s day is difficult for my family. Thankfully I #8217;m not really affected as I #8217;m 16 but I can see how other people feel. As an Irish person in Ireland I get wanting to celebrate today. But because of social distancing and self isolation please if you can don #8217;t go out. You may not catch anything but you can sure as hell spread it. No one wants their grandparents, or aunts and uncles, or family member who #8217;s immunocompromised/pregnant to die. This isn #8217;t just about you and having fun. I get it. You want to go out, or see your friends. But this is one year you shouldn #8217;t. Think before you do. No one wants to lose someone they love, even if you personally don #8217;t know who died, someone does.</TEXT>

I #8217;m also demisexual and demiromantic. I usually just say bi demi because it #8217;s easier. Recently I #8217;ve heard of the term demigirl. Most of the time I feel female but words like  #8220;woman #8221; and  #8220;girl #8221; feel slightly off. On discord my pronouns are set to she/they because seeing  #8216;her #8217; felt wrong like it didn #8217;t fit. I think it applies to me but I #8217;m worried I have too many labels and I #8217;ve also seen people say that  #8220;at this point people make up terms to feel special #8221;. I #8217;m scared that I will be seen as attention seeking and abnormal. If anyone is demigender please let me know what that #8217;s like for you and how it feels to identify this way.

    <TEXT>I #8217;m honestly considering leaving this subreddit. There are great people here and I #8217;m glad of that. But I #8217;m sick of the fucking jokes people make that they shouldn #8217;t. Like a title that says I FINALLY BEAT CANCER and when you open it  #8220;I deleted tiktok #8221;. People just want attention and do anything for it. Worse is when people post their bare arm and have 15 YEARS CLEAN FROM SH but they #8217;re only 14-15 years old. Not only is that so ignorant but it #8217;s triggering (don #8217;t come at me for saying that I mean actually triggering not fake tRiGgEReD) and makes anyone who actually struggles with it seems worthless like they are stupid for having an addiction. There are good people here. But there #8217;s a lot more shitty ones Edit: I #8217;ve also found a lot of homophobic and transphobic stuff here. THEY ARE NOT MENTAL ILLNESSES. THEY DONT NEED TO BE  #8216;FIXED #8217;</TEXT>

    <DATE>2020-07-06 15:55:14</DATE>
    <TEXT>Being triggered is an awful experience and definitely not something you should want. When you say you #8217;re  #8216;triggered #8217; from a game or tv show that #8217;s not being triggered (unless there #8217;s a specific thing in there that causes a flashback etc) If you say you #8217;re triggered just because you #8217;re upset or angry at something that #8217;s not being triggered, but it does invalidate people who actually experience it. If you have a cold you wouldn #8217;t say you had cancer because you know what you #8217;re going through isn #8217;t like that or that bad. When you say triggered and don #8217;t mean it properly it makes it seem stupid when people actually get triggered (and possibly relapse/remember something awful) For everyone #8217;s sake please just don #8217;t say it unless it #8217;s actually real *dont comment saying I #8217;m tRiGgeReD by people who say it because you #8217;re the exact person I #8217;m calling out*</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I #8217;m going to rant here sorry but here #8217;s the thing about  #8220;the friend zone #8221; and being demiromantic/demisexual (I #8217;m both). Please don #8217;t complain that it #8217;s  #8216;not a real thing #8217; or  #8216;not lgbt #8217; because no one cares. I have to be friends before I can date you because I honestly won #8217;t feel anything about you if we just date immediately. It #8217;s awful being friends with someone and realising you have feelings for them but you are friends so you can #8217;t date. It #8217;s equally bad if you become friends with someone because there #8217;s a small chance you might want to date them, either because they like you but you don #8217;t like them yet, or you think you could like them in the future. The friend zone is stupid I know only like one person will ever read this but anyway</TEXT>

    <TEXT>By people saying jokes that done hurt them they don #8217;t realize it hurts us. It definitely depends on the context. If your wife offered to cook you could make a joke and it #8217;s not sexist. If you randomly tell her she should be in the kitchen instead of with you then that #8217;s sexist. This joke may be transphobic and context matters. Some jokes bother me because I know how they hurt people.
