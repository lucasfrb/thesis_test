    <TITLE>Looking for a good tabletop vaporizer.  #128077;</TITLE>
    <DATE>2016-03-20 16:44:40</DATE>
    <TEXT>Long story short, I recently lost my beloved table top vaporizer. It was a hose type with a built in fan (noble vapor). All I can find are these passive air type vaporizers and they give me the worst head pressure because I having to suck really hard (that's what she said!). I've tried pen type vaporizers and have the same issue. I'm trying to find another table top hose type with a built in fan. It seems if I can't find what I am looking for I may end up going with a volcano. Please give me any suggestions if you know of any forced air vapes or if you have your own suggestions. I would appreciate it! Happy vaping! :)</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I agree with this a lot. I used to be the same way with my hook ups and FWB #8217;s. Another great way to voice your likes or dislikes could be like this  #8220;Such and such feels so good #8221; or  #8220;I love when you do such and such #8221; also,  #8220;Can we try such and such? #8221;. Since sex is so causal now I would just be up front with what you like and what you don #8217;t like and use that as a filter to screen out one lays.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I can happily say we are EBF but I feel like she #8217;s never satisfied. Is that just how it is in this stage? With my first we supplemented so I don #8217;t know what to expect this time around. I feel like she #8217;s always nursing and always crying for milk. I also feel I should add I eat a plant based diet. Would that affect the quality of my milk? Edit: thank you for your replies. Baby has a great output of wet and dirty diapers. Eats very well and is in fact gaining a ton of weight. Like a few mentioned could be cluster feeding. I appreciate your time to comment  #10084; #65039;</TEXT>

    <TEXT>So I #8217;d like to get a consensus on what you mamas feel is the best breast pump and why. If you have used a breast pump previously and the pump you are using you feel is superior, why? I currently use the Medela PISA But have heard that other pumps such as Spectra are better but have a hard time finding exact reasons. Curious as to if you feel certain pumps deliver a better output. Thanks mommas!</TEXT>

    <TEXT>My family is all vegan, but one year we decided to go all out and cook a real thanksgiving with a turkey for family (grandpa is  #8220;old fashioned #8221; and it was my first house so I wanted to celebrate with a get together). Made food for them and food for ourselves. Spent way too much money and everyone barely touched the food. Then when I sent them home with food (for obvious reasons) they complained! I knew they were saving room for another family members get together. Needless to say I #8217;ll never host like that again.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>This wasn #8217;t in high school but it was an experience I had which I feel like I should share. I had two bullies (sisters in fact) that would constantly follow me around and call me fat. I mean it was ridiculous and relentless. I would come home crying and feeling so horrible about myself. One day in the lunchroom she #8217;s like  #8220;look at the fat pig #8221; and I looked her dead in the eye and I said  #8220;yeah you know what I am fat #8220;. From that day on she never said anything to me. So what I can say is just face the bullies head on. Don #8217;t give a crap what they #8217;re saying because they are just a few shitty people in a sea of good people.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>So I know this sounds crazy but I actually had a realization maybe a few years back. This would happen to me all the time where I would be feeling great and then the next day I would just feel super awful and I would feel like crap the next few days. Sometimes I would even feel depressed, suicidal, or even just plain I don #8217;t give a fuck about anything in my life. I would have what you would probably call outbursts and just really depressive episodes. Then I started cutting out food in my diet and I noticed that whenever I would eat wheat ( Anything bread related or anything that contained gluten ) the next day and days afterwards I would feel this way. Doing some research led me to find out that some peoples bodies have a sensitivity to the ergot In the gluten. So pretty much anything that contained ergot would cause this to happen. I would suggest trying to cut these things out of your diet and going so far as to be very cautious what type of foods you put in your body. Barley and wheat are two main offenders when it comes to this type of thing. You may notice that you feel better cutting these out.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>So to answer your questions as best I can - Expected amount of sessions: expected amount of sessions depends on skin, age of tattoo, and the artists hand (heavy handed vs. Light handed). Some people can see complete fading in 3-4 sessions and some won #8217;t see any major difference until 6-7. In my personal experience I didn #8217;t see anything crazy until after 4 sessions. - Pian: that depends on your tolerance and also tattoo location. They do offer things to help ease pain during the removal like numbing cream, zimmer (it #8217;s like a refrigerated ac hose you direct at tattoo site), and some places offer nitrous oxide or aka laughing gas. My experience with pain is mixed. I recently had a full calf tattoo laser and it was really rough for me but it was very large and the ink was super dark. - Severity of scarring or likelihood: again this depends on your body. Some people end up with major scarring and some don #8217;t. You will already have scarring from the tattoo itself because a tattoo is basically a scar. Do be aware that you may have hypopigmentation in the area of the tattoo. - Cost per session: this depends on the clinic. Some places give a good deal and some don #8217;t. You are looking at about 100-400, but since your tattoo is small it will probably be on the lesser side. Clinics do offer discounts for multiple pieces done or multiple sessions paid up front. - Risks: typical risks are that of potential infection if the wound is not properly cared for. Your clinic will give you aftercare instructions which you need to follow diligently to ensure good results. Advice: go with a good laser. Picosure or Cutera Enlighten. Those are the best on the market as I know of right now and will give you better results in sooner time. Just expect your poor guy to be quite sore and probably no sex for up to two weeks. Best of luck!</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I read about waiting 12 weeks but is waiting longer a better idea? Of course they are always out for the money. I had a tattoo removed a few years back and the technician said six weeks and so I was going every six weeks and then it ended up being six sessions. I ended up having to move and I didn #8217;t have the funds to finish the process and while I was waiting I noticed that I ended up having more fading waiting longer time</TEXT>

    <TITLE>Pico sure VS cutera</TITLE>
    <DATE>2020-09-24 12:57:43</DATE>
    <TEXT>Hi all. So I have previously had experience getting a tattoo removed with the Picosure laser. Seven sessions in the tattoo is maybe 80% removed. I recently started getting another tattoo removed with the Cutera and I #8217;m just curious if anybody has had any good luck with the Cutera or if the Picosure would be a better idea. Is one better with colored inks and another is better with black ink #8217;s?</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Honestly I noticed more fading as time went on. I had gotten a tattoo lasered and ended up not going back for a whole year and I noticed more feeding during that time than I did in between the six weeks that the technician had said. This time I #8217;m going 12 to 14 and I #8217;m pretty sure I #8217;m going to see better results</TEXT>

    <TEXT>To my knowledge the mineral drops are pretty much the same or similar stuff that he uses in his recipe. I believe my mistake is only taking a 3rd of the concentrate instead of the full dosage. In a previous comment I was breaking down the supplement facts and I was only taking the recommended dose to start of 10 drops. It then says to work your way to 40 or 1/2 tsp. Perhaps I was supposed to take the full 40. I don #8217;t know haha so many questions</TEXT>

I put it on 2-3+ hours before my session, wrapped with plastic wrap and kept it on til the appointment. Then an the appointment they cleaned off my cream and put their own on for another 30 minutes. I can not tell you how much anxiety I had before the session but once the laser hit I literally FELT NOTHING. Of course I am getting 2 lasered at a time but the cream really changed the experience. The cream didn #8217;t wear off until the next day but your experience might be different. Also took extra strength Tylenol and I think that helped too.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Are you fasting for weight loss? I #8217;d look up the diet doctor and see if maybe that might be up your alley. I seem to have a hard time with it too and the snake juice is gross, mineral drops are gross so getting electrolytes is tough. Diet doctor allows you to eat bone broth for electrolytes and they even have their own electrolyte elixir that tastes way better than snake juice. Lemons have potassium which means you can do lemon water if that works. Of course if you #8217;re doing bone broth as needed you jump right back in to the fasting.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>That #8217;s the hardest part for me is having children. First of all because once you have children your body becomes more efficient with food and second because kids eat! Don #8217;t beat yourself up about it and just jump right back in to it. Also on your referring days just try to stay as clean as you can. Binging can definitely reverse any changes in no time.</TEXT>

    <TITLE>Finally broke my plateau. Yay for small victories!</TITLE>

    <TEXT>Back story. Had a baby in December and postpartum weight was 184. Got down to 165-167 and had been struggling to break that. Finally after a week of OMAD and my first attempts at extended fasting (24-48hrs) my weight this morning was 156.5 and that is plus 38 oz of water in my system. My next goal is 145. To anyone struggling right now, you CAN do it and you will!</TEXT>
