    <TEXT>**Translation via DeepL:**  gt;Formula 1 owner Liberty Media has negotiated new leeway for the racing series with a billion euro loan to keep Formula 1 solvent  gt;  gt;What if Formula 1 cannot meet its payment obligations? This is the question that those responsible at Liberty Media have asked themselves. Their answer: in order to remain solvent in the Corona crisis, the racing series needs more financial leeway. That is why Liberty Media has renegotiated a loan agreement worth billions.  gt;  gt;In concrete terms, this is a loan of 2.9 billion US dollars, or the equivalent of just under 2.6 billion euros. Added to this is a loan for a further 500 million US dollars (around 445 million euros).  gt;  gt;The corresponding contracts are linked to obligations that Formula 1 would not have been able to meet due to the lack of races so far. For example, in the case of the debt ratio: under normal circumstances, Formula 1 would have kept this within the permissible limits with its Grand Prix income. But the Corona crisis made this impossible.  gt;  gt;In order not to breach the contract, Liberty Media renegotiated these very obligations and met with the goodwill of the lenders. In this way, those responsible for Formula One have obtained additional freedoms until 1 January 2022, because certain provisions had been suspended until then.  gt;  gt;Formula 1 Managing Director Chase Carey is relieved and speaks of a "new flexibility" that will enable the racing series to "survive this difficult period".</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Translation via Deepl:  gt;It began with a call from Lewis Hamilton: Mercedes team boss Toto Wolff explains how the W11 was painted black and what is to follow  gt;  gt;  gt;  gt;This Monday, Mercedes surprised everyone by painting its W11 for the 2020 Formula 1 season completely black, in a move that the world champion team wants to set an example in the fight against racism and for more diversity in the premier class. Now team boss Toto Wolff explains how this design came about.  gt;  gt;  gt;  gt;World champion Lewis Hamilton, who is actively involved in the "Black Lives Matter" movement, had approached him. "Lewis wanted to know from me what sign we can set as a team. Something that goes beyond two postings on Instagram," Wolff is quoted by the 'Standard' at a media round in Vienna.  gt;  gt;  gt;  gt;So the idea was born to start the season in Austria on Sunday with black cars instead of the usual Silver Arrow look. "The board of Daimler and the sponsors immediately supported us," Wolff reveals and emphasizes that the new livery is by no means to be understood as a PR campaign.  gt;  gt;  gt;  gt;**Wolff confirms lack of diversity at Mercedes itself**  gt;  gt;"The right beliefs are not enough if we remain silent. We therefore want to use our voice and our platform to stand up for respect and equality," says the Mercedes team boss. He hopes that this will also initiate a rethinking process in his own ranks.  gt;  gt;  gt;  gt;Because: "Only three percent of our workforce belong to an ethnic minority, only twelve percent are women. This lack of diversity shows that we need new approaches. There is a lot of talent for whom the door to Formula 1 has been closed so far. We want to change that." The paint job alone is not enough, of course.  gt;  gt;  gt;  gt;Wolff is not thinking about a quota, but says: "We want to deliver something substantial. Increasing diversity will improve our performance in the long term. We want to cooperate with universities that fall off the grid of the classic engineering universities like Cranfield, Imperial, Oxford and Cambridge.  gt;  gt;  gt;  gt;**Self-reflection: Wolff now experiences the problem more consciously**  gt;  gt;In doing so, the team is following the approach of Hamilton, who recently set up a separate commission. The Briton wants to promote more diversity in so-called MINT subjects and thus ensure in the long term that people from different backgrounds can enter the racing industry more easily.  gt;  gt;  gt;  gt;Wolff praises this commitment. "Lewis uses the momentum to make a difference, he wants sustainable change," the Austrian noted. "He asked me how often I have thought about my skin color in my life. How often I had the feeling of being disadvantaged. To be honest: Never."  gt;  gt;  gt;  gt;But the problem of discrimination is not limited to skin colour. "I've never been asked how I reconcile my job with having a child. It happens to my wife all the time," says Wolff. "It's not only about the obvious discrimination, it's also about the subtle one." They also want to sensitize people to them.  gt;  gt;  gt;  gt;Translated with [www.DeepL.com/Translator](https://www.DeepL.com/Translator) (free version)</TEXT>

    <TEXT>The teams aren't in a great place right now in terms of finance, with the impacts of COVID19. That's why they're pushing the regulation changes another year, because hopefully next year will see the teams in a better financial condition. It hurts as a fan to watch the same boring HAM BOT VER in some order, but it just isn't possible to change the regulations at their original time. It's just asking the teams to spend money that they don't have. Edit: wording</TEXT>

    <TEXT> gt;Scuderia AlphaTauri Formula 1 boss Franz Tost believes that the philosophy of a constructor is "out of date", and that teams should be able to buy more parts from rivals  gt;...  gt;Tost believes that his team should be allowed to take even more advantage of its relationship with sister outfit Red Bull Racing, with the two teams sharing resources via design facility Red Bull Technology.  gt;"Because we reached such a high level on the technical side, the top teams have such a fantastic infrastructure. If someone wants to come into F1 - even the teams which are in F1, if they want to catch up - this is very difficult, and nearly impossible.  gt;"And you spend millions. And I'm just asking, what for? I'm asking, why does every team have to have its own wind tunnel, has to have its own CFD, has to have 500-600 employees? OK, now there is the cost cap coming. But nevertheless in my opinion we still spend too much money, especially now under these difficult economic circumstances.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Hey James, not sure you will see this but I'll try anyway. I'm a 17 year old looking at studying Bachelor of Aerospace Engineering next year. The university also has a FSAE team. I know that F1 teams value experience in motorsport. How much does it help if someone has been a part of an FSAE team? Also, I have heard that it's a bit harder as someone from a foreign country (I'm an Australian) as it's harder for visa and stuff. How much of an effect does that have on a prospective application? If you see this, thanks for doing this AMA and answering my questions if possible</TEXT>

    <TEXT>The FIA mandated the inclusion of an extra fuel flow sensor in the engine (obviously to monitor the flow of the fuel into the engine) this year. It is believed that Ferrari were exploiting a loophole in prior years to increase the fuel flow above what is stated in the regulations. That is what the FIA's settlement with Ferrari before the start of the season was concerned about. It seems that after this extra fuel sensor was mandated, Ferrari's loophole was closed up, so they've lost the performance that they had gained using that loophole Edit: Clarity</TEXT>

    <TEXT>It's not necessarily that it is a dying sport, because it isn't. I think it's more due to FOM and Liberty Media largely switching to pay TV to show live races. That's why the races aren't necessarily accessible to everyone, also some people might not want to subscribe to pay TV just for F1. It also might be due to the current racing situation, with Mercedes' dominance. People are more likely to watch if they know that more than one people has a chance to win races and championships. Right now, it's become a bit boring watching a Mercedes 1-2 every weekend with a sprinkling of Max here and there. From [this Forbes article](https://www.google.com/amp/s/www.forbes.com/sites/csylt/2020/01/21/f1s-worldwide-tv-audience-crashes-by-20-million-viewers/amp/) (sorry about amp link)  gt;Formula One has revealed that it lost 19.2 million viewers worldwide last year as it began a new contract in Britain which sees Pay TV network Sky Sports exclusively broadcasting all but one of the races live. .  gt;F1 #8217;s audience reversed by 3.9% to 471 million last year meaning that it has lost a staggering 129 million viewers since 2008 driven by a move towards Pay TV.</TEXT>

I think you could see clearly how much they struggled. #8221;  gt;The team  #8220;also had some problems with the overall grip of the car #8221; in qualifying, Sainz added,  #8220;but in general, I would say that, yes, they need a very big step on the engine coming. #8221;  gt; #8220;I know how tough it is because it took Renault a few years, #8221; he said.  #8220;It #8217;s taken Honda quite a long time also. But the fact that they are nearly there or at least Renault is nearly there, close to Mercedes, also shows that you can do it.  gt; #8220;For me, if there #8217;s a team with facilities, if there #8217;s a team with resources, if there #8217;s a team with a lot of engine benches to try and improve, that #8217;s Ferrari. So I #8217;m sure the now is working flat-out and hopefully by the time I get there they #8217;ve improved a bit and together we can do the next step. #8221;</TEXT>

There is no crisis, no tension.  gt;"[Instead] there is bitterness and frustration in each of us. But I believe that this frustration must be transformed into reaction and determination."  gt;Asked what message he would give to Ferrari's long-standing supporters, Binotto said: "We understand the fans. We are very sorry, we are the first to admit, and we are sorry for them too.  gt;"What is happening, in fact, is that we have a car that has lost power, just as all the engine manufacturers have lost it. We more than the others.  gt;"Last year the engine partly covered the limits of the machine, but this year it is no longer the case.  gt;"The limits of the machine are emerging. On that point it is clear that we must improve."</TEXT>

    <TEXT> gt; Red Bull team principal Christian Horner said the affair still left some lingering frustration despite seeing Ferrari drop out of contention at the front this year.  gt;"The whole thing has left quite a sour taste," Horner said.  gt;"Obviously you can draw your own conclusions from Ferrari's current performance.  gt;"There are races that we should have won last year arguably if they had run with an engine that seems to be quite different to what performance that they had last year.  gt;"It's obviously very tough for them, but I think their focus has obviously been in the wrong areas in previous years, which is why they're obviously seem to be struggling a little with whatever was in that agreement."  gt;Wolff said on Sunday that he would agree with Horner's "sour taste" comment, revealing that Mercedes lost engine staff as a result of being stretched by Ferrari.  gt;"Ferrari is an iconic brand, and fantastic people that build these cars," Wolff said.  gt;"It's difficult to say, because I don't want to put any more oil into this.  gt;"But we were really stretched so much last year and the year before, that we suffered.  gt;"We lost some people. We lost some people in terms of, just being at the end of their health.  gt;"And this is why I would probably follow Christian's comment."</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Hi Valtteri, thank you so much for doing this. How easy or hard was it to first adjust to DAS? You have gone throughout your whole racing career being used to only turning the steering wheel left and right, how much of a change was it to get used to this third direction of movement? How long did it take to get used to it?</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Translation via DeepL:  #8203;  gt;Sebastian Vettel bought an old Williams FW14B from the 1992 season, according to information from "Bild". In this car Nigel Mansell celebrated his only world championship title. We reveal what makes this legendary racing car so special.  gt;  gt;  gt;  gt;Sebastian Vettel is an avowed fan of Formula 1 history. When the Heppenheim native talks about the heroes of the past with their significantly lighter and louder racing cars, the 33-year-old regularly goes into raptures. He has fewer kind words for the over-complicated hybrid monsters of the current generation.  gt;  gt;  gt;  gt;As a self-confessed Ferrari fan, however, one would probably have expected Vettel to put a Grand Prix classic from Maranello into his garage. But far from it: According to information from the "Bild", the four-time world champion recently bought himself an old Williams. The model in question is an FW14B from the 1992 season.  gt;  gt;  gt;  gt;The legendary car is one of the most successful Grand Prix racing cars of all times. In 1992 Nigel Mansell and Riccardo Patrese won ten of 16 races. Mansell, who drove with the legendary red starting number 5 on his nose, superiorly secured his first and only World Championship title.  gt;  gt;  gt;  gt;**Vettel and Mansell with starting number 5**  gt;  gt;  gt;  gt;At that time the FW14B was equipped with some electronic helpers. Williams developed the active suspension to perfection. Also the traction control was superior to the competition. In the meantime, both are no longer allowed in Formula 1.  gt;  gt;  gt;  gt;When the car came on the market, Vettel obviously couldn't resist the offer: "The Red 5 was very interesting for me. The car is an absolute icon for me and, just like me, has the starting number 5," the Heppenheim native explained to "Bild" why he bought it.  gt;  gt;  gt;  gt;Vettel had to dig deep into his pockets for the car, which was designed by star designer Adrian Newey. In 2019, one of only six FW14B chassis built was auctioned off at the British auction house "Bonhams" for 3.02 million euros including surcharges. In the gallery we show you again some pictures of the ten-cylinder monster.  gt;  gt;  gt;  gt;\*\*\* Translated with [www.DeepL.com/Translator](https://www.DeepL.com/Translator) (free version) \*\*\*</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Translation via DeepL:  gt;The drivers and engineers have to make do with only three days of testing before the start of the season in 2021. Where the winter tests will take place has not yet been decided. Three tracks are currently under discussion.  gt;Now that the Formula 1 calendar for the current season has finally been finalized, planning for 2021 can begin at the F1 headquarters in London. The bosses of the premier class hope that next year there will be "business as usual" again. This means that the number of races will again exceed the 20 mark.  gt;Of course, it is also important that spectators are allowed at the tracks again. Only in this way can the million-dollar fees be redeemed by the promoters. But whether the corona virus can be brought under control in all countries by the planned start of the season in March is more than questionable. That is why various options are currently being played through.  gt;For example, the traditional start of the season in Australia could fall through. Melbourne is one of the metropolises in the world most affected by corona. The local authorities have already given the city a complete lockdown twice - most recently in mid-August. If Melbourne cannot be driven in Melbourne, Bahrain currently has the best chances as a replacement candidate for the season opener.  gt;A postponement of the 2021 season is currently not an issue. The teams have to plan their development with the time frame that we already know from previous years. This means that the new cars must be ready for the first tests at the end of February.  #8203; ** gt;No cancellation of the 2021 winter tests**  gt;The complete cancellation of the winter tests to save costs, which the teams and the FIA initially discussed during the Corona break, is now off the table. However, the scope is being halved. Instead of two test weeks with three test days each, the teams have now agreed on only one test week with three sessions each.  gt;According to information from auto motor und sport, McLaren in particular had pressed for the winter tests not to be cancelled altogether. The British racing team is changing its engine partner for the new season - from Renault to Mercedes. The tests are intended to check whether the integration into the chassis has worked as planned in theory.  gt;The teams that are signing new drivers for 2021 have also made a strong commitment to maintaining the test drives. In addition, the cars will change more than originally thought over the winter. The FIA is planning further aerodynamic changes in the technical regulations in order to reduce downforce and relieve the Pirelli tires.  #8203; Winter tests 2021 in Bahrain?  gt;It is still unclear on which track the tests will take place before the season. Besides the usual suspects Barcelona and Jerez, Bahrain is allegedly on the list of candidates. The increased costs for the teams due to the long journey are to be compensated by a subsidy from the local promoter.  gt;Because the airlines are currently not working to capacity due to the Corona crisis, charter flights can be carried out at much lower prices than before. But there is one catch that Bahrain has, however, which cannot be solved with money: the geographical distance means that spare parts cannot be shipped from factories in Europe to the route at such short notice.  gt;\*\*\* Translated with [www.DeepL.com/Translator](https://www.DeepL.com/Translator) (free version) \*\*\*</TEXT>

    <TITLE>Hi all, I am u/subject9233, one of the new mods for the sub. Here's a small introduction from me</TITLE>
    <DATE>2020-09-16 23:57:31</DATE>
    <TEXT>Hi r/F1Technical, hope everyone is having a good day/night. I have very recently been accepted as a mod for this sub, and just wanted to introduce myself. You would've likely seen that I am very active on r/Formula1, so a lot of you probably know me from there. I am also a mod over at r/GrandPrixRacing, so some of you might have seen me there too. What can I say about myself, I am very enthusiastic about F1, started watching during the Vettel's domination in Red Bull, never looked back from there. I have a genuine urge to learn more about the inner workings of an F1 car, I hope to have a career in F1 someday. I live in Australia, so obviously have a bit of trouble following F1 thanks to the time difference. But enough about me, let's talk about r/F1Technical This sub has been neglected for too long, due to circumstances largely outside of the community's control. But the new mod team (still under construction) will work tirelessly to restore this sub to what it can truly be. I have written five new rules, which I will outline below. They are not by any means final, and will be subject to change based on how effective they are. 1. **Technically Related** \- Basically to keep general F1 discussion in other subs and keep this sub solely related to technical aspects 2. **Repost/Duplicate Content** \- Fairly straight forward 3. **Low Quality** \- Includes memes, reaction posts and general joke posts that are irrelevant to the sub 4. **Harrassment/Trolling** \- Trolls are bad, no one likes them. This rule will keep the sub civilised and friendly 5. **Bigotry/Whataboutism** \- In light of recent global events, this rule is necessary to handle those racist, sexist etc. discriminatory comments.  #8203; If the community has any other suggestions, I would be happy to hear them, just leave them in the comments of this post. We will most likely be recruiting more mods, but we are still in the process of sorting that out. Thank you to the original mods for giving me the opportunity to mod this unique sub, I'll try to do my best to make it a better place. u/subject9233</TEXT>

If there's several reports on a comment, the mods can step in and ask the OP to provide a source and/or add a message below the comment stating that it is inaccurate. How does that sound?</TEXT>

    <TEXT> gt; Does the proposed rule #1 pertain to submissions only, or to comments as well? I think it should only apply to posts, I know the comments can branch out, and that's great. General discussion shouldn't be stifled.  gt; , as the subreddit grows, we might start seeing the same text-post questions appearing over and over Do you reckon that's a problem currently? Just trying to get an idea of where the community stands on that. Maybe in the future if it gets out of hand, we can do something like a Daily discussion thread or something?  gt; \#3 is good, necessarily a bit subjective though. Yeah, obviously there will always be a fine line between what is a low quality post and a genuine post, but we will leave that up to the community to decide with reports and downvotes. Each post will be judged individually on whether it breaks the rules, there isn't really any clear black and white.  gt; \#5 is a bit tricky Definitely one of more difficult rules to define, that's for sure. Again, downvotes and reports should take care of this too, and each post/comment will be manually reviewed before any changes are made.  gt; Maybe a generic "no racism" rule would be better. The problem with this is that the rule curbs more than racism. It also targets other forms of discrimination like sexism, etc. And the rule also applies to comments that aren't racist/discriminatory, but imply something on the lines of *"Just do your job and drive"*, and *"You are tackling this issue, what about that one?".*  gt; Or "no politics" As you said, that'd be very hard to moderate. Even in a sub like this, politics is so deeply ingrained into society that it will be hard to truly ban politics. I agree with you though that politics is mostly irrelevant in the sub.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>It's a great suggestion, I'll give you that. But we would have a very hard time trying to implement something like that. For one, we don't have the knowledge to needed to verify each and every comment. The most viable alternative I see to this is what I suggested above in [this comment](https://www.reddit.com/r/F1Technical/comments/iu7ykv/hi_all_i_am_uomk4r123_one_of_the_new_mods_for_the/g5k7y8i?utm_source=share amp;utm_medium=web2x amp;context=3). It will obviously take time to implement any major change like this, and majority of the community needs to support it. But seriously, thanks for bringing this up. I didn't even know this was a problem, and now I can see how big it actually is.</TEXT>

    <TEXT># APPLICATIONS HAVE NOW CLOSED, THANK YOU TO THOSE WHO APPLIED. SUCCESSFUL APPLICANTS HAVE BEEN CONTACTED FOR FURTHER DISCUSSION. Hi [r/F1Technical](https://www.reddit.com/r/F1Technical/) As many of you will know, the sub recently went through some major changes regarding the mod team. [u/Mulsanne](https://www.reddit.com/u/Mulsanne/), the only old moderator who was actively moderating the sub has left, leaving us in his/her place. We obviously can't handle such a large sub on our own, especially around race weekends when the activity really kicks off. As such, it is time we add some more resources to the mod team. We are looking to build a robust and stable team, with at least one mod active at any given time in the day to ensure the community runs smoothly and keeps improving. Moderators will need to carry out a wide range of tasks, including: * Keeping on top of the Mod Queue * Banning offending users * Helping redesign the old.reddit layout * Setting up AutoModerator parameters If that sounds like something you can get behind, you can apply via the form below. This is the first step of the process. If you are selected to move on, we'll have an in-depth talk and then select the final moderators. #</TEXT>

    <TITLE>Introducing the New r/F1Technical Mod Team</TITLE>
    <DATE>2020-09-30 11:14:26</DATE>
    <TEXT>Hey r/F1Technical Many of you would know that the sub recently underwent a major change in leadership. Last week, we announced that we are recruiting extra mods to help us rebuild the sub and implement the ideas suggested by the community. We would firstly like to thank all of the applicants for taking the time to fill out the application. The mods appreciate their willingness to dedicate time to improving the sub. We've added new mods to help cover the gaps in time zones we have, and to help manage the increased workload involved with revamping the sub. We'd like to welcome all of the new mods to the team, treat them kindly. We'll let them introduce themselves. # u/Brukfu  gt;Hello [r/F1Technical](https://www.reddit.com/r/F1Technical), I am u/brukfu, 21 years old and from Germany. I am watching F1 for over 10 years now and I am especially interested in Formula 1's Technologies and Innovations. I am happy to be one of the new mods on this subreddit and I will help to enforce the rules and keep this sub clean. # u/fried_brainn  gt;Hi everyone, I'm u/fried_brainn. I'm happy to have become a moderator for this fantastic subreddit. This subreddit is my go to place related to F1 Technical stuff. I got into F1 in 2003 season and became fan of McLaren and Kimi , and it's love affair has continued to this day. I'm looking forward to contributing to the subreddit behind-the-scenes as a moderator and thank you for the mod team for entrusting me with this role. # u/noname_Maddox  gt;Hi I #8217;m [u/noname\_maddox](https://www.reddit.com/user/noname_maddox). I #8217;m Irish and I #8217;m a F1 and music nerd. I #8217;ve been following Formula 1 from 1990 and have watched every race since, without exception, some 544 races out of a total of 1028 ever held. I love F1 and I #8217;ve seen it evolve and change over the years, but no matter what has happened in the sport, the story always remained the same, the best team and the best driver.  gt;  gt;  gt;No matter whether it was Fangio in a Mercedes or Lewis in a Mercedes. It #8217;s always been about what a driver can do alone in their car against the competition. The teams all have the same rule book and design their car separately. Despite all the variables they arrive on the grid and are all within a handful of seconds of each other. How they accomplish this has always fascinated me.  gt;  gt;  gt;I love learning how a team develops the edge over another and it #8217;s why I love this sub and learning from the amazing people who post and comment. I #8217;m honoured to be selected to be a moderator here and with my experience will do my best to help improve and facilitate its growth to become the F1 Technical hub of the internet.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Hey mate, thank you so much for writing this up. As someone who wants to work in F1 in the future, this was a real eye-opener. I am currently studying my Bachelor of Engineering (Aerospace) at Monash University in Melbourne, Australia, in my 2nd year. I'm thinking of joining my university's FSAE team next year (you'll probably know that it's one of the best FSAE teams globally) to get some sort of motorsport experience. I have a few questions. Firstly, how hard is it for someone like myself from Australia to get a job in F1? I am planning to do a masters in motorsport engineering at Oxford Brookes when I graduate. Would the fact that I've done my undergrad overseas work against me? Also, how much does prior motorsport experience help your application? I was thinking of joining a local Supercars team to get some experience of how a racing team works. I've heard from others that FSAE experience is very highly regarded, but wanted to know how much **actual** motorsport experience helps.</TEXT>
