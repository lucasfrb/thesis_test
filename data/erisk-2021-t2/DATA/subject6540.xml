    <TEXT>I believe there used to be a post that was a sticky on this sub but doesn't seem to be there anymore. It laid out basically everything for a first timer to know, including "THE FIGHT (TM)". Does anyone have a link to it or can anyone find it? It is our first time checking out a local club this weekend. Thanks!</TEXT>

    <TEXT>No need to ALWAYS use carb heat, in most scenarios all you're doing is robbing yourself of power. The key is learning to diagnose it, and yes using it as a precaution on approach.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I mean eventually you run out of throttle. If you're leaving it on during a full power climb, you are losing performance. You are most certainly entitled to your opinion. Maybe where you live is extra humid. I would still argue that knowing your drills (cause check) for power loss is more important. Refer to the PA31 that landed on 36th St in YYC because they forgot to switch from the aux to main tanks. I'm sure some airplanes are more susceptible to carb ice than others, and maybe then, sure, have at it. I've never seen a need to just leave it on in a 172 or Cherokee. Unfortunately with training trending towards the lowest common denominator, maybe we will see "just leave it on all the time" as the standard doctrine in the future. Or eventually carburetors will die out in favour of fuel injection and even diesel GA planes.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I'm thinking of the "Old Man Yells at Cloud" Abe Simpson meme, but also totally agree! However, the club we went to recently was at a totally reasonable level! And I am very sensitive to loud noise so I still have to lean in to hear well. But compared to regular clubs, it was quite reasonable.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>We went to a club for our first experience and had a wild time! Granted not everyone will be so lucky. We exchanged numbers with the couples we played with, seeing one this weekend and trying to set something up with the other later on! Work schedules are definitely tough to coordinate between 4 people, especially since I work a lot of weekends. But I feel like having met them already at the club, we are all way more motivated to see each other again!</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Pretty much the same thing happened to me. Our first time at a club, we ended up going upstairs with 2 other couples to play, and I was able to get hard on and off in between sensory overloads, but there wasn't much pressure because everyone was doing a bit of everything, but no full swaps. Fast forward a week and we are meeting up with a different couple who we clicked with but didn't play with. We were flirting and sexting with them the whole week on kik. But being 2 on 2 was much more intimidating for me, and just like you, even though seeing my SO get pleasured really turned me on, and even though I was also getting/giving pleasure, I really struggled to get it up at all throughout the night. I've had the exact same self doubts about the LS, whether it is for me, etc., but communication is key like everyone else says and we are going to give it another go at the club for new years. It might have just been too much too fast for me, plus pretty much everyone was willing to full swap but me (since it's hard to do that when you're not hard) and that didn't make me feel any better either.</TEXT>
