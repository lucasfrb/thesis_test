    <TEXT>Just don't do It If you are early in a game like that, peeps who hoard Stam make a very slow progress that will limit you in the future. It's worth It to be up to date with chapters so you can craft suits for Momo quests and get your rewards, get chapter suits that are getting prettier and prettier, and get the possibility to craft next lifetimes (or pre farm for the Pigeon one). Sacrificing all of this is not worth It to complete a mere stamina suit that we get very rearly and doesn't even look good. You can complete most stamina suits with for free with natural Stam regeneration anyways. That's my opinion, rethink It</TEXT>

If you're on 17 I'm pretty sure you can't craft White Blossom or pre farm for future lifetime or Idk If you can even craft Icewind Warchant (with hoarding Stam you will craft It in snails peace, just like everything else).

    <TEXT>Yes we have, The Green one with a dandelion. And It's quite common for CN server to have recharges back for crafting. I actually prefer them that way, I would like to see more challenging suits. Bringing back sth like super expensive recharge and making It the boss of the game (for crafting), or bringing back sth like ranking suits and making them extremely hard and expensive to craft (the final boss for crafting). It's probably a really unpopular opinion, but I like challenges and expensive suits (quite weird for a V0)</TEXT>

Peaces from fleeting dream are easily usable with other cloud peaces. If you have many hell events suits you are used to big items and matching them gets easier. I appreciate the craftsmanship and I actually like how big they are. It makes them stand out, I don't care If you can't see the whole thing. I don't really care about efficiency, I don't think hell suits should be efficient, you have regular event suits for that, and If you exclude hell events from the discussion you have mostly perfectly usable suits. I think we should let devs go wild when It comes to hell events, let them do what they want. Hell suits are supposed to be gorgeous, over the top and expensive</TEXT>

    <TEXT>We have that Barbie collab suit and old Hell Event suit which fit the theme 100%, beside that you can just slap some angel wings and It won't be that bad. North soldier fitted the Icewind Warchant the most since It's the most iconic and legendary knight in the Miraland. Dark Verdict was very direct, but you could easily use sth different, that childhood theme fitted the free suit with bubbles, besides Debbie we have a lot child like suits.

It just feels like baiting. Another Edit: I didn't know that that Kiss was unpleasant for Kimi, I didn't pay enough attention I guess, I belive consent is very important, and that Kiss shouldn't have happened</TEXT>

Mental illness is sth that I struggle with, and am the most strict with myself so I sometimes forget that not everyone can do the same as I, and everyone deals with things differently. I don't know If It's relevant, but I do have PTSD so I understand your point of view to some extent</TEXT>

When I was younger I would sometimes lash out, but It was always to people that hurt me. I learned that lashing out was useless tho, no matter what I do they won't treat me better</TEXT>

But I think these people are not aware that Jisoo is the only member that is consistent in her live singing and is also the soul of the group, is the best at variety and always supports other members. Besides that she could be a great actress If YG had given her a chance to act. I would like a group with 4 members as minimum tbh</TEXT>

      <TEXT>Well I'm the opposite here, I like honesty and hate when people lie to me. I know from the experience that knowing the reason is better. That 14 old has her own brain and isn't a little kid, she has a right to know. OP could also just sit down with her daughter and ask her If she wants to know a reason even If It's hurtful and will change the way she looks at her father. Fucking with kids emotions unnecessarily is leaving them in the dark. I don't think younger kids should know, because they aren't mature enough to understand, but 14 year old is old enough in my opinion</TEXT>
