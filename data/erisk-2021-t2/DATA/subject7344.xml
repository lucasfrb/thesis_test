    <TEXT>I am pretty new to posting I probably only post a few times on here.. but with that being said how do I get this post to where a dev sees it?? The problem with this Spider-Man milestone is they take away PURPLE gear credits which is very necessary to everyone. And also maybe that #8217;s why they put the purple gear deal in for 5 bucks a few days ago.. but what if you didn #8217;t want you buy it you are just out of luck till this event is over. Why couldn #8217;t they have kept the gear credits in.. and don #8217;t tell me they are limited to the stuff they can put in the circle cause for the second strike milestone was full of stuff for the last milestone..</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Devs, please reconsider ISO-8 Datamines show that the Devs are about to introduce ISO-8, a system that will allow us to modify the stats on our characters by upgrading them, presumably for $/time like Red Stars. SWGOH (a similar game) has had a system like this for a long time. Devs, please reconsider this choice. One of the best things about MSF is that it is not too difficult for new players to pick up and play on their phone. This system is going to require a lot of research and micromanagement to optimize, and as it is, it can be difficult for new players to know which characters to invest in. More micromanagement is bad for new and casual players. I get that this is a way for FoxNext to make more money, but this game is already very expensive for competitive players. There's an old saying that pigs get fat and hogs get slaughtered. If they make it too expensive and hard to stay up-to-date, they will reduce the number of players in the game and we will burn out faster. We chose this game over games like SWGOH for a reason. Don't emulate games that have alienated their player base by being too expensive and requiring so much micromanagement that they are no longer friendly to most mobile gamers.</TEXT>
