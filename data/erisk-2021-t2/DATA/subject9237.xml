    <TITLE>G433 Issue- No Sound, static, etc.</TITLE>
    <DATE>2019-11-17 00:27:31</DATE>
    <TEXT>I've been having some issues with my G433 that I got about a year and a half ago. Quite often it seems the audio cable isn't making a proper connection, so sometimes the mic doesn't work, sometimes it's tinny, sometimes I only get audio from one headphone of whatever I can hear, sometimes I head nothing from the audio I'm listening to, sometimes the microphone only passes static through to whoever I'm talking to, etc. Plugging and replugging, twisting the jack around when it's plugged in, etc. generally ends up resolving it after awhile, but something definitely seems to be wrong with some part of the connection chain. Was wondering if anyone has had a similiar issue, and might have a suggestion on potential fixes, minus just getting rid of the headset and replacing it. Most often it seems fiddling with the headset side of the main cable ends up fixing it after a bit.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Our War Game was a major point. People like to say it was mostly the dub, but that's a bit disingenuous to the Japanese version of Adventure, that while it didn't really have romance, those were 2 of the characters that tended to speak, interact, etc. the most, along with adding in the general 'childhood friend' elements that often shows up in media and anime (to say nothing of anime generally aimed at a younger audience) as it relates to relationships.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>We've gotten a bunch of news lately for Digimon, from Digimon Adventure: to Kizuna coming out in the US, to a stack of products... With all of it flying in quickly it's reasonably possible you've missed some news, so here is a quick news index. These aren't in any specific order, but they are grouped when it makes sense to. [ Digimon Adventure Kizuna in US Theaters](https://withthewill.net/threads/22830)\- We get the new movie in March, and the announcement gave us our first hint a new show was coming. [There will be an early Kizuna screening](https://withthewill.net/threads/22916) in Japan in a week and a half, with cast and crew as guests. [The LB Pop-Up Theater](https://withthewill.net/threads/22895) will get another Digimon pop-up store themed after Kizuna, along with [screenings of the second Digimon Memorial Short](https://withthewill.net/threads/22921). Digimon Adventure: The new anime series went from a hint in the US Kizuna news to 'we have a ton of info' super fast. [The first bit of solid info we got](https://withthewill.net/threads/22864), when we thought the title was Digimon Adventure  #936;. [Early V-Jump images, plus a promo poster gave us a bunch of info.](https://withthewill.net/threads/22870) [We got a teaser for the series](https://withthewill.net/threads/22888), along with more information from the new official site, and Bandai's Digimon site updating. [Not to mention a nice clean version of the poster](https://withthewill.net/threads/22884). [The teaser was shown at the end of DigiNavi ](https://withthewill.net/threads/22920-First-Images-from-Digimon-Adventure)along with a single new shot of Taichi, giving us our first look at animation from the new series. [A brand new Digimon Card Game ](https://withthewill.net/threads/22890)was announced! [Our first look at it was in V-Jump.](https://withthewill.net/threads/22871) [We got to see more previews](https://withthewill.net/threads/22917) when the official Twitter opened. [In V-Jump we got a look at some new characters for Digimon Survive](https://withthewill.net/threads/22871), plus detailing what your in-game phone can do. The Battle Spirits Digimon card set is coming soon and [a promo poster](https://withthewill.net/threads/22837) gave us our first look at art from it. Did a V-Jump misprint reveal[ a new level](https://withthewill.net/threads/22885) due to a Battle Spirits card? Or just card terminology being changed? [2 Agumon crane game plush prizes ](https://withthewill.net/threads/22889)are coming soon! [Covers and tracklists ](https://withthewill.net/threads/22881-Covers)for the upcoming Kizuna CDs! The CSA Digivice -Last Evolution- was announced and we got details[ from MonMon Memo](https://withthewill.net/threads/22891). [The Animate Digimon Kitchen Car Returns](https://withthewill.net/threads/22900)  amp; in store Animate will have a special Kizuna Shikishi if you buy Digimon products. [The Kumamon Adventure collaboration](https://withthewill.net/threads/22907) was announced! [We got a small update](https://withthewill.net/threads/22911) on the Idolmaster Starlight Stage Game collaboration. [Digimon News Navigation](https://withthewill.net/threads/22918) happened after a couple months of teasing, and felt a bit deflated, since most of what they likely planned to show was announced ahead of time. We did still get some announcements though: [The Amplified model kits will continue with MetalGarurumon](https://withthewill.net/threads/22919). [The new Digimon Card Game will get a set of promo cards titled Version 0.0](https://withthewill.net/threads/22925). [New details for Stuffed Collection Wormmon  amp; the CSA Digivice -Last Evolution-](https://withthewill.net/threads/22926). The most interesting thing from DigiNavi was probably [the Digimon Project Trailer](https://withthewill.net/threads/22923). This trailer isn't for anything in particular, just showing the past, present, future of the brand, and acting as a general 'brand' trailer. [The US V-Pets come back for a second wave, as do the Digimon Figural Keychains](https://withthewill.net/threads/22912)! Both are scheduled to come out over the next few months.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>They did not give up the crests. They drained them. It was always reasonably expected they'd have enough energy to do so again, which was mentioned in the explanation of draining them. Later in 02 we see them get energy and evolve higher again, as you mention. They also give up that boost to help Imperialdramon (there was no limit on it that I can recall, they simply drained it to help him.) Agumon gets another boost, as does Tailmon and Patamon, later in 02.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>It's just giving a general number of how many there are. I don't believe it came up in 02 (been awhile since I watched it, it may have shown up in it), but in the general lore of the world of Adventure the number of people with Digimon partners doubles every year. In theory the number has always gone off '8' in 1999 from Adventure, which equates to 16384 in the year 2010, but I don't believe it's ever been clarified specifically how exact the number is (for example, there were definitely more than 8 in 1999 that we know of) and the number Mimi gives doesn't necessarily account for elements like rounding, people appearing over the year, etc.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>For the shows you'll want to track down the DVDs. Many/most have been discontinued as certain licenses have been expiring, so you'll want to check Amazon or other retailers. There was a Seasons 1 thru 4 box that can still be found which has most of it. Digimon the Movie, and the later dubbed films are not available on home video. The original Digimon the Movie DVD isn't that hard to track down cheaply. There was no full length dub with the cast you are familiar with. There was one or two alternate English dubs that were limited to TV airings in a few countries in Asia. Digimon Adventure tri. is plentiful and easy to get. For the new movie the main things you'll want, and that are available, prior to seeing it are- Season 1, Season 2, the Movie, all 6 parts of tri.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>The UK and Australia DVDs are still plentiful (to be fair, it's not super hard to track down the US ones), but those would have issues due to frame rate conversion. The Movie disc is discontinued everywhere as the Fox license lapsed a long time ago. The other older movies never had a disc. That Toei and Bandai are going full bore with Digimon means Toei will likely want to get the shows, etc. licensed out to someone, so we'll see what happens in the future.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>It was from TV Tome (which later became TV.com). TV Tome was (broken down simply) like a wiki for TV shows. Something like House of Mouse was reasonably popular with kids, and somehow it got added and no one had the proper credentials to remove it. So for a decent period of time there was a listing that included a fake plot synopsis, and for a decent chunk of time random people believed it was real (as will happen with almost any random internet thing.)</TEXT>

So not that much overall.) Basically, there is a reason why movie 2 is generally the best loved movie, and 'part 2' of Digimon the Movie is the most liked part. The movie is just really good.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Kakudou, the director of 02, and Konaka, the writer of your example, have both made it very clear, Konaka was always a guest writer. He was not introducing arcs to show up and be picked up on. He was effectively writing a Digimon Cthulu story, which was meant to end on a foreboding note (as those stories often do.) In fact, those sorts of endings show up in Konaka's work quite often (for better or worse.) Konaka being hired for one episode was inspired by Kakudou seeing the design of a Digimon they had available to use, him realizing it was inspired by Cthulu, and knowing of Konaka's love of that mythos. The plot elements not being used in the way you expect them doesn't really have anything to do with it being planned out or not. For example, Konaka was the head writer for Tamers. He has also made it reasonably clear that more than a few relevant arcs in Tamers he had little to do with (them being story elements that he considered to be on the side, or just not focused on the main plot he wanted to tell.) Much of the Impmon stuff really had little to do with Konaka. It also seems a bit odd to think Tamers has no fat on it. Tamers has just about as much as everything else does.</TEXT>

That the siblings still saw eachother to a degree, especially while young is, to my understanding, more than uncommon, at least for the era of the original show.

    <TITLE>Coronavirus General Thread  amp; Updates Regarding Kizuna Screenings</TITLE>
    <DATE>2020-03-16 20:34:29</DATE>
    <TEXT>With more and more posts being made the mods decided we needed a general/megathread for Coronavirus related concerns and posts.  #8203;  #8203; As of the initial time of this posting, the US screenings for Digimon Adventure: Last Evolution Kizuna have not been cancelled by Fathom/Toei. Many areas (such as LA and New York) have shut down theaters, and with more areas likely to follow, the screenings overall likely will be cancelled or delayed. We will update as information shows up. Update- Regal has just announced all of it's theaters will be closed until further notice. Update- AMC has now announced all their theaters will also be closed. At this point, even with no official word from Toei or Fathom, it would be best to consider the screenings cancelled, as at this point most theaters are simply closed even if you 'wanted' to try.  #8203; Update- Toei and Fathom have formally announced it is cancelled. Both also refer to rescheduling it.  #8203; [https://twitter.com/ToeiAnimation/status/1239990090060820480](https://twitter.com/ToeiAnimation/status/1239990090060820480) [https://twitter.com/fathomevents/status/1239989886590914560](https://twitter.com/fathomevents/status/1239989886590914560)  #8203;  #8203; If you are in an area where theaters have been ordered closed, you likely have already gotten a refund for your ticket, if not, give it a day or two before you contact anyone, as it's likely just making its way through their systems.  #8203; We've also unstickied the main Kizuna discussion thread until we have a better idea 'when' people will be able to see the movie.  #8203; This will also act as a general thread for any images, etc. people want to share, so feel free. Once this is posted any general threads asking questions or sharing images will/may be removed at the discretion of the mods without further warning.</TEXT>

It's also worth mentioning, there are different versions of the 15th Anniversary ones, with some different elements, along with multiple versions of the original version (including various changes based on region, or which release it was even in the same country.)</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Anime often isn't finished super far ahead. But even if the show 'is' further ahead, other shows may not be. Stopping most of their content at once allows them to have a single message about what they are doing. In the case of something like Digimon, it also benefits in that they are stopping 'as' the opening arc stopped, rather than being in the middle of a plot, which could cause issues for keeping an audience interested.</TEXT>

    <DATE>2020-04-20 08:57:58</DATE>
    <TEXT>The mods decided we needed a new thread that would contain both of the larger Coronavirus delays for the franchise, and to just have a new thread in case anyone wanted to post regarding the virus, their concerns about it, thoughts, etc.  #8203; As previously reported, the Digimon Adventure: Last Evolution Kizuna screenings in the US and other countries did not happen. Officially Toei and Fathom have said the US screenings were 'delayed', and the originally scheduled showings were cancelled. You should have gotten a refund awhile ago. If you did not, please contact wherever you got tickets from. [The previous Coronavirus General that also contained details on the Kizuna delay can be found here.](https://www.reddit.com/r/digimon/comments/fjrw2g/coronavirus_general_thread_updates_regarding/) If/when new screenings are announced, or a digital or disc release, the news will go around quickly. If this thread is still here, the answer is almost certainly 'nothing has been announced.' Update- [Shout Factory has announced](https://www.reddit.com/r/digimon/comments/g4vpbi/digimon_adventure_last_evolution_kizuna_us_home/) the movie on Blu-ray and DVD in July. [Joshua Seth is back as Tai](https://www.reddit.com/r/digimon/comments/g4w41i/joshua_seth_back_as_tai_in_digimon_adventure_last/). At the moment it appears the theatrical run will not be rescheduled.  #8203;  #8203; Digimon Adventure: has also been announced as being on a hiatus. Episode 3 aired on April 18th or 19th based on where you live. The show, along with other Toei shows, will not air any further new episodes for the time being. When the show will return with new episodes has not been announced at this time. [The previous thread with information on the hiatus is here](https://www.reddit.com/r/digimon/comments/g4jbgw/digimon_adventure_going_on_hiatus/).  #8203;  #8203; Episodes 1, 2, and 3 are still available at the handful of streaming services handling distribution of the show: [Crunchyroll's page for Digimon Adventure: is here](https://www.crunchyroll.com/digimon-adventure-2020). (Most of the world) [VRV's page for Digimon Adventure: is here](https://vrv.co/series/GYEX24PV6/Digimon-Adventure-2020). (US only) [Anime Lab's page for Digimon Adventure: is here](https://www.animelab.com/shows/digimon-adventure). (AU only)  #8203; Our discussion threads for the 3 episodes if you want to join in are here: [Episode 1- Tokyo Digital Crisis](https://www.reddit.com/r/digimon/comments/fur4qz/digimon_adventure_episode_one_discussion_tokyo/) [Episode 2- War Game](https://www.reddit.com/r/digimon/comments/fzf6kb/digimon_adventure_episode_2_war_game_discussion/) [Episode 3- And to the Digital World](https://www.reddit.com/r/digimon/comments/g3vybm/digimon_adventure_episode_3_and_to_the_digital/)  #8203; This will also act as a general thread for any images, etc. people want to share, so feel free. Any threads about these topics asking basic questions or sharing images will/may be removed at the discretion of the mods without further warning. As mentioned above, you are welcome to share them here.  #8203; To end on some positive news.

    <TEXT>That is not the way animation is produced. Anime is often being worked on until it airs. (If an anime series isn't super long, and it has a random clip show or two during the run, it very often means they realized they were going to miss finishing an episode, and rushed to put together a clip show. Wolf's Rain is one of the better known examples of this.) When they did the early screenings for Kizuna 'the month' the movie was coming out in Japan, the director warned the audience the film wasn't finalized, and some smaller bits might change.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Slightly more detail... the game never had a release date recently beyond '2020'. The most recent issue of Famitsu posted that the game is now TBD. The Japanese blog poster who posts early Famitsu stuff also discussed prior delays for the game. One random Nintendo fansite mistranslated it badly and most sites ran with that translation rather than checking the original source (he was discussing the 'prior' time the game went into silent mode to redo a lot. This is where stuff like 'the game is being overhauled' is from. Basically people saw a random site say it, and just ran with it without checking, which... it simply doesn't say that.) A Bandai US rep claimed Famitsu had simply made a typo regarding the date and it was still 2020. In addition it should probably be mentioned, Famitsu does list a page with corrections to mistakes. The page for the issue this was in does not currently list any sort of correction regarding Digimon Survive.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>No, they didn't. They advertised that they would have Future Mode in the game, and then later had to say no they weren't going to, licensing issues. They said nothing about 'what' the licensing issue was, and they use the Digimon brand under licensing from Bandai. In other words, they tried to use a Digimon, likely without checking, and Bandai said no when they found out. Bandai and Toei use stuff from V-Tamer 'all the time'. The upcoming ULForceV-dramon figure is explicitly designed using elements from the manga (with a Bandai rep discussing it on stage), even though it's branded as Savers. Taichi was designed by the manga artist (Tenya Yabuno) from V-Tamer, as was a ton of other stuff we see constantly. Yabuno shows up for Digimon stuff constantly. Fans saw that the DMO company wasn't allowed to include Future Mode and created an entire fiction to explain it. It realistically is a simpler explanation, such as... Bandai isn't super interested in having 'signature' unique characters used when other things can be.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Various bits here aren't quite right. I don't believe Tamers had anything missing from the toyline (at least that I can recall. All toylines tend to have small shifts, but nothing in the Tamers line was abnormal offhand.) Xros Wars also did have DVDs, they were contractual rental exclusives and they finished out entirely (new artwork for the covers and everything.) Xros also had a rather significant extension with Hunters. People can debate 'why' that happened, but if the show didn't do well enough to warrant it, there were much simpler ways to fill that timeslot.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>A number of these (but certainly not all) did get figures, 20ish years ago. You basically just have to look around ebay and places that sell older toys. Japan had some under the name 'Spirit Evolution' US and in the EU had some released as 'Spirit Digivolving' and 'Hybrid Digivolving' Post Season 4 some were released in the US, but those were rereleases of the season 4 ones.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>The thing is, even if the card line changed, it did not 'end', and it was still quite Tamers focused while Tamers was on. And Xros didn't get DVD boxes, because Digimon was in demand by rental shops, and it was done as an exclusive. After Xros ended the home video line for legacy content has been the BD-Boxes, which hasn't gotten to Xros Wars. We're generally aware why there were no toys in the second half, various plot and character elements were redone, and by then it likely wasn't worth Bandai's time to play rushing catch up (I wish we had more, and better, of the Toei behind the scenes studio thing that aired minus the few screencaps we still have.) And last up, viewership data stopped being the main driving force for a lot of anime a long time ago, far before Xros Wars (the exceptions are of course the top 'top' performers.) There were 'many' shows far more successful than Xros Wars, that ranked far below it. It performed well enough to 'be' the extension with new episodes. It wasn't a necessity that it had to be new Digimon content. Is Xros Wars one of the more successful Digimon series? Absolutely not. But the overall analysis that tends to be applied is generally based on more what was expected in 2001 than then in 2010 and 2011. Xros Wars, what expanded ratings data we have, often shows it dueling with Fairy Tail, Bleach, and a number of other shows in the ratings. But those numbers mean somewhat less than people tend to think they do. (In the same way that many fans think that Dragon Ball Super home video sales in Japan equate to the show not being popular, when that simply isn't what sells for that show.)</TEXT>

    <TEXT>A source isn't needed for the rental one. The home video market for anime content was reasonably robust at the time, simply having a show be rental only was because it was paid for by a rental group association to have it as such. That it ended up that way at all was based on demand, there was no other reason to do that. As for changes. Production does not always work that way. It often does, but not always, especially if things change in production. Many times things have come out and the product line is simply not to the level of sync you'd expect. Had it been a case of Bandai giving up, there would have been minimal reason for Toei to allow the staff to change things up (or for the companies to allow the manga to continue, etc.)  #8203; For the ratings element, it is an equal comparison, because you were using ratings as an indicator of success in and of itself. When ratings in and of themselves don't mean that in the era the show came out in. And of course, low ratings are relative. Product sales are of course important, and of course, generically, many things came out that the community never covered back then (kids apparel, etc.) Overall Xros Wars did fine enough, and kept the brand going. If Xros Wars was simply doing poorly in and of itself, there were any number of solutions if they wanted to 'hold' a timeslot for half a year. They also certainly didn't need to bring in guest actors for a finale for a show if it had been doing poorly long term. The show could just 'end' and they could slap something else in the slot. Toei has done reedits, etc. before, and they will again. Holding a timeslot if necessary isn't insanely hard, and they certainly didn't need to have new designs and content done for what was 'functionally' a new show. Toei has also never been one for 'not' dropping what isn't working.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>You don't, and I don't plan to give further to be honest, but I will explain to a degree. You've linked to a fansite that has ratings information, with no information where it is from, when ratings outside of a specific range from Japan are often based on secondary TV markets, with no mention where some of them came from. It doesn't mean they are inaccurate, but neither are they solid sources (especially in the case of Savers and Xros, which often was outside of the range given out solidly), especially if you are going to demand from others. (Another source you gave was you seeing people discussing it on 2ch.) In the case of Xros on DVD, they didn't make 19 volumes, with new art on every volume, over years, and decide to randomly go 'eh, we won't sell this' for no reason. (In the same way that steelbooks with fancy covers for movies are often exclusive to one store chain per country.)  #8203; I've given you information based on various way things tend to work in the business, you are more than welcome to say it's untrue or that you don't believe me. The degree of information you want, in some cases exists, in other no company would hand out random information, and it's based on taking into account how companies do business.  #8203; As an example, Bandai hasn't officially said Hacker's Memory sold poorly. The producer was disheartened after the game came out in Japan and seemed to not do well. After that, any statement from Bandai about sales just nebulously referred to 'Cyber Sleuth' with no mention of Hacker's Memory sales, but the occasional mention of Hacker's Memory being a 'chapter' or 'part' of Cyber Sleuth has come up. It appears they've functionally (prior to the release of Complete Edition) decided to count both as one game (further complicated that in Japan, Hacker's Memory 'always' came with the original game in the first place.) But Bandai hasn't told us they are doing that, and they reasonably are unlikely to.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I honestly think Sora got some decent moments in tri., Part 4 especially, by putting her in a situation with Piyomon that was generally opposed to her own experiences. She arguably didn't get as much depth added in tri., but then a good chunk of her issues she was forced to deal with in Adventure in a more direct way (especially regarding her mother.) It wasn't a relationship drama minus some bits of ship teasing, so that they didn't delve into it much may have been disappointing, but isn't unexpected.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>'Tamers' is usually regarded as the best' Except by numbers of people who watch the shows. Or buy the shows. Or buy the products. Or vote for their favorite Digimon. Basically Tamers is the best if you ask someone who thinks Tamers is the best.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I like Tamers fine, but it also tends to not be what people discuss it as. Watch Tamers again. It is 'far' from consistent. Those early episodes have more than a few issues, and tend to not even be what people discuss the series being overall. The top voted fan favorite Tamers episode is even episode 43, which skews away from the things people say they prefer in Tamers, and tends to feel more like an Adventure or 02 episode in general (which, it wasn't written by Konaka, which is why.) Even the 'sort of a pilot for a sequel' that was done a few years ago is what people 'say' they like from Tamers, and that sort of landed with a thud after people thought about it.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>It says... you are comparing things that aren't the same thing with Digimon and Kaguya (and My Next Life as a Villainess). One is designed as an ongoing series and they have to take into account that even if they are fine 'now', they may not be later in the schedule, especially since they aren't necessarily sure when things would be 'close' to normal. The other is designed as a short series, that waits until it is done or nearly done to schedule to air. It also helps to pay attention. The last episode of One Piece before it went on hiatus was April 19th. The same day Digimon Adventure: aired the last episode before it went on hiatus. So all it says is... nothing, minus whatever people imagine.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>You aren't going to get an answer that is helpful to you. The people who are most likely to show up and respond in detail aren't interested in your question, don't have the knowledge, and are far more likely to toss in their nonsense. For example, Muur loves to talk about 'Cyber Sleuth sales records' (plus just giving bad information in general.) But the numbers they gave us aren't inherently impressive 'outside' of Digimon. And Bandai has gone out of their way to 'not' clarify if they are 'only' talking about Cyber Sleuth, or both CS games (Cyber Sleuth came with every copy of Hacker's Memory in Japan and a few other regions, so it'd be hard to believe they aren't including Hacker's Memory sales for example, but they have been disinclined to clarify, as you'd expect.) It's also worth mentioning Kamen Rider absolutely 'did' fade away at one point, and all the information people have about Pretty Cure suggests it came very close to them being done with it a number of years ago before one show did very well and they found their way forward.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Once again, we don't actually know 'what' numbers Bandai is talking about, because they have not clarified. The unique way CS has been released means there are inherently issues with the numbers without clarification, because they very well may be counting 2 games. The numbers given for CS was after 'years' of it being out, out on multiple platforms, all given as 'one' number (prior to the Switch/PC version being out.) The numbers you are giving for Ni No Kuni 2 was after 2 months. The Fatal Bullet sales also ignore that the game sold over 1 million before it ever hit Switch. Your numbers are terrible and worthless, are given with no understanding or 'actual' information behind them, and I wouldn't be shocked if they are just being copied off whatever you find first.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>That would suggest a misunderstanding of what Fun Live is. It isn't like it's a 'Nintendo Direct' livestream or the Bandai-Namco 'Play Anime Live' yesterday. It's a series of streams showing off 'specific' games. As in, the Fun Live stream today is showing off an SAO game. It's not tuning in to a stream for a collection of announcements. Each is purely showing off new stuff and updates for games, with the exact games named and on a schedule for when you are tuning in to see them. Tekken 7 is a big game for Bandai-Namco for example. It is not on the schedule for Fun Live. It won't randomly pop-up in the middle of the stream for another game.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Most of the figures made are more in the format of 'statue' rather than action figure. An Omegamon action figure will no doubt pop up again at some point, but it's a matter of how nice it'll be, and the cost. The Ichiban kuji/sho figure at roughly 50 is going to be reasonably nice, and look good on a shelf, and be available soon. You have to weigh that over it not being exactly what you want, but with what you want potentially taking a long time to come out (or if it comes out soon, it might very well be one of the under $10 Shodo figures, which may not be as nice as you want.)</TEXT>

He attacks you due to his habit of being very often wrong, while wanting to be taken as an expert. The franchise began with digital toys, and quickly became something else once the animation began, which has defined the franchise since then. Even his beloved games almost always use elements liberally from the anime, because that has been the primary element people have known for over 20 years. But you not knowing something doesn't change that it was there.</TEXT>

No matter how many opinions the person gets, they still gotta make up their own mind, and being that it's a show that's easily available, for free, nothing is going to be worth them spending at least 24 minutes watching episode 1 and deciding. Moreso since to get any depth of opinion would likely take them more than 20 minutes in the first place that they could have just watched the show in.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>The movie coming out again in some form simply requires someone to license it. Whether the music rights are part of it, or they'd have to be relicensed, etc. I couldn't say for sure, but in many cases of 'movies', especially ones that aren't super old, them being part of the actual 'movie' would have likely been in the contracts.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Yes and no. Added content in kids VHS tapes was considered a plus. Even what was intended as promotional material like this could be advertised as a feature to the tape. This is also why some VHS tapes of Saban shows (I remember it being done with the Shadow Borg episodes of Bettlebords specifically) would have the episodes on them edited into a 'mock' movie and actually listed as a feature length adventure. It made it more desirable to kids, as they felt like they were getting more (or a newly put together version of episodes they've seen), and parents felt like their money was getting more time for the tape to run. That it's introduction type stuff that fits the first 2 parts of the movie certainly is a plus, but I would guess it was a promotional feature that was made for something else and just made sense to slap on here. I don't recall if there was a specific 'story' about where this was from, although it wasn't on the DVD release that I remember. I don't recall if Digimon ever got one, but promotional VHS tapes with 1 or 2 episodes, and an introduction feature, wasn't an uncommon stack to see at a toy store, saying you'd get a tape if you bought a figure or two. It's possible it came from something like that originally. While some of my old Digimon VHS tapes might still be in a box somewhere, I don't even know if I still have a player to check.</TEXT>

    <TITLE>Digimon Adventure: Last Evolution Kizuna Discussion Thread</TITLE>
    <DATE>2020-09-28 02:05:49</DATE>
    <TEXT>After various covid related delays, it's finally time to discuss the 20th Anniversary Digimon Adventure movie! You can discuss any and all things Kizuna here! # This thread will contain spoilers, so if you haven't seen Last Evolution Kizuna, come back later!  #8203; # Where/How can I watch Kizuna? The digital release of the film in the US (and Canada) is officially on September 29th. We expect this will be about 9pm Pacific on the 28th (midnight eastern.) The film will not be on streaming/subscription sites at release, it will be for purchase only. (So no Crunchyroll, Hulu, etc.)  #8203; Update- The digital release is out at the announced storefronts. English and Japanese are seperate versions. A version costs $15 to buy in HD  amp; $5 to rent. SD copies are slightly cheaper. iTunes- [English](https://itunes.apple.com/us/movie/digimon-adventure-last-evolution-kizuna/id1529775526)| [Japanese](https://itunes.apple.com/us/movie/digimon-adventure-last-evolution-kizuna-subtitled/id1530512618) Microsoft Store- [English](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/p/digimon-adventure-last-evolution-kizuna/8d6kgwxn7hgd?activetab=pivot%3aoverviewtab)| [Japanese](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/p/digimon-adventure-last-evolution-kizuna-original-japanese-version/8d6kgwxn7hgc?activetab=pivot%3aoverviewtab) Playstation Store- The PS Video store doesn't have weblinks, you have to search for the movie on the PS4 or compatible PS Video apps. Hopefully more stores are added. At this time there are no plans for the movie to be made available on subscription or free streaming services. It is a purchase/rent release at this time.  #8203; The Blu-ray and DVD are out October 6th in the US and Canada from Shout Factory. Both of these include the English dubbed release and the original Japanese audio with English subtitles. They also include interview content with Joshua Seth (Tai) and Tom Fahn (Agumon.) The Blu-ray release is a combo pack that also includes the DVD. [Blu-ray at Amazon](https://amzn.to/2XTRNDe) | [DVD at Amazon](https://amzn.to/2xLPreM)  #8203; Shout has already begun to ship discs bought from their own store. [The Blu-ray from them includes a rolled lithograph](https://www.shoutfactory.com/product/digimon-adventure-last-evolution-kizuna?product_id=7404). Update- As of October 5th, the lithograph is sold out.  #8203; Various theatrical runs are happening outside of the US. Check your local theater schedules if they are open. Releases on home video (outside of the Japanese disc last month) haven't been announced outside of the US discs yet (Australia is getting a small theatrical run though.) For most countries, you'll want to keep an eye on local anime distributors, who may have announced upcoming plans.  #8203;  #8203; If you are out of the US or Canada, any number of stores will hopefully allow overseas shipping if you just want to import the US disc.  #8203; # What is Digimon Adventure: Last Evolution Kizuna? The newest Digimon movie has been advertised as the last adventure of Tai and Agumon, before the former has grown up. Without spoiling plot details, the 2 primary plot elements advertised are- Digidestined/chosen children around the world have begun to fall into comas with their Digimon vanishing, and the kids find out that growing up and deciding on who/what they want to be ends up breaking the connection they have with the Digimon. A primary detail is with a visible countdown, and their actions to help speeding it up, what will Tai, Agumon, and the others choose to do when it comes to having more time with their Digimon, or helping others. And of course, if the bonds they've made can be saved. The movie is a single story, but it does follow up on Digimon Adventure, 02, and tri., including characters, visuals, and thematic  amp; dramatic elements. Watching these, along with various prior Adventure related films would be a good idea, and if you haven't, a working knowledge of the characters from them, and what the characters go through would help you understand the movie, although Kizuna does work as a standalone tale as long as you have an idea of the characters.  #8203; The film is unrelated to the currently running 'Digimon Adventure:' television series, which is a reboot/alternate universe.  #8203; Kizuna takes place in 2010. Digimon Adventure took place in 1999, 02 in 2002, and tri. in 2005.  #8203; [Toei has put up a free short called 'To Sora'](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rtnwIuJy5BY). It is subtitled, and takes place the day before the movie. It's recommend to watch To Sora before the movie, as it does some setup. If you watch after it might fill in some details, but it isn't a necessary watch either way, although it does work well, and add to the experience.They made 4 more shorts with various connections to the movie. Those 4 are not currently available in any form, and are known to be less plot relevant (2 haven't been screened in any way at the time of this post.)  #8203; # You mentioned an English dub? There is. The English dub for Kizuna is based on the Japanese translation and is written by Jeff Nimoy, who wrote and directed much of the franchise in English (most notably Adventure, 02, the movie, and Data Squad.) The translation in tone is more akin to the later content he wrote, where it's a dub that is roughly similar to the Japanese version, but with various punched up bits for those who are familiar with the dubs of Adventure, 02, and tri. (the general tone of the dub would be closest to tri.) The cast from tri. is mostly returning for their characters. Some of the 02 actors returned for their characters also. Various other actors from Adventure, 02, and tri. were planned/intended to return, but due to various production issues relating to the covid pandemic, some additional recasts ended up happening.  #8203; The most notable actors who aren't returning, who otherwise might have been expected to: Philece Sampler is not back as Mimi (seemingly due to covid), Brian Donovan is not back as Davis (confirmed due to a home studio issue happening at the same time as covid), Robert Axelrod is not back as Armadillomon (due to his passing), and Neil Kaplan is not back as Hawkmon (seemingly due to covid.) # Anything else? Not much... as mentioned above, the digital release is on September 29th, the disc on October 6th. On Saturday, October 3rd at 5pm Pacific, a few days after the digital release of the film in the US there will be a watch party from Toei. It will be hosted by Justin Rojas, with Robbie Daymond (Joe and Armadillomon) and Erika Harlacher (Menoa). They will watch the film and give commentary, along with giving away prizes. Some scenes will be shown in the corner as they watch, so if you want to watch the film along with them, you'll need to have it up in a window.  #8203; Hopefully this (not quite as short as intended) post helps with questions you may have had. Enjoy the movie and any discussions to follow!</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Those were exclusive to the Village Vanguard chain last year as part of the Digimon Adventure 20th Anniversary. Wrote about them here- [https://withthewill.net/threads/exclusive-digimon-adventure-20th-products-at-village-vanguard-more-teased.21304/](https://withthewill.net/threads/exclusive-digimon-adventure-20th-products-at-village-vanguard-more-teased.21304/) It's always possible they are still in stock, but unlikely (I don't think they had an official 'end of event' date), but you most likely will have to figure out what search terms to use and look around at Japanese auction/sales websites.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Pasting in what I wrote the last time someone asked, as whether you like it or not is going to be different for everyone, but the main thought is: Adventure- Them as children. 02- Them a bit older. tri.- Them as teenagers. Kizuna- Them becoming adults. There isn't a direct plot connection. But it is the characters developing. If you skip it and miss character development that may matter, you may notice, or you may not. u/strict_strategy had similar thoughts when it was asked, and wrote it out pretty well: I would tell you to not skip Tri for one reason and that is some of the life lessons the gang learned in tri are being used in Last Evo. Tri is the High school arc for the gang and in high school you start to see things differently which results in you not doing something which you were ready to do so when you are young. These life lessons for me personally are shown in the Last Evo movies.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>It isn't a released game in that fashion. It's a service. You aren't buying a complete game, you are paying for the access to the service. And of course, there will always be exceptions. It doesn't change that very often, games fall into a hole they simply don't climb out of.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Most of that is incorrect. They have the raw footage in HD, questionable as it is qualitywise. Resycing it to the dub would take work, but it's certainly been done for less lucrative anime series. They have subtitles... questionable as they are. They don't really need to 'make' special features if they don't want to. The DVDs had minimal special features. A company would license 'from' them and pay on their own to put everything together, no external financier would likely be involved. There is no rights differences to the English and Japanese. Toei owns them both. The same company, under license from Toei, had both dub and sub available for a period of time.</TEXT>
