    <TEXT>The Vita release was split into two games, Haukoki Kyoto Winds and Hakuoki Edo Blossoms. There are new characters not in previous releases (PSP, PS3, 3DS, etc.) while other characters who were not romanceable before now have their own routes. The routes are longer as well, due to the splitting. Kyoto Winds is already available in the west and Edo Blossoms is coming out soon.</TEXT>

It reeks of a purity test being done on less than solid claims. Multiple vegan Youtubers on the site promote things like potato cleanses, that women losing our periods while eating vegan is healthy, all oils are unhealthy, and that you can eat whatever you want on a vegan diet and will meet your nutrient needs.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Your idea that a society versus a subculture has to decide if something is good or bad is something that can turn discriminatory quickly, particularly when it comes to oppressed groups. In regards to animals not suffering, I would wager a good portion of livestock animals are not killed in one blow, so would they not feel prolonged pain which is pretty much the definition of suffering?</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Women should have access to safe and affordable abortion on demand. We reserve the right to body autonomy. Otherwise, you are pro-forced birth. Animals deserve to not be forcibly impregnated for human gain. If anything, someone using this argument to you sounds like someone who just wants women to not have access to abortions and does not really care about animals tbh.</TEXT>

    <TEXT> gt;Today, Rosalia no longer exists, nor do most of the companies which sponsored it. Because of this, Neighbor has been lost to time and cannot be obtained anywhere in Japan or elsewhere. So the rights for the game were up for grabs? I am not familiar with how such a scenario would play out with Japanese IP laws and such. The goal is just a little over $5,000? Not to be a negative Nancy, but that amount seems low for both a remake and localization in my opinion. Not to say they need $100,000+ but $5,000 for both seems like multiple rounds of funding are needed. Or they have another source of funding already planned.</TEXT>

Since Aksys going under would be known to Arc due to their close relationship, I do not see why they would let a sinking company publish the game versus say, NISA who published Birthdays the Beginning and will release Happy Birthday too.

    <TEXT>Considering how popular the "soyboy" insult has gotten, and how so many meat advertisements cater to straight men, I do not see veganism connected to white masculinity. Maybe white male vegans talk about veganism in a more "rational/logical" way but that has more to do with how males are socialized to discuss their passions I would guess. Also, the studies abstract states that all 20 men are from a semi-urban (suburbs?) area of the southeast versus a more regionally diverse pool, which is going to affect things.</TEXT>

So many of the issues in this Kickstarter seem like things they should have figured out before it was even available to back. Like a five minute brainstorming session about possible issues could have caught so much of this. I await the autumn update telling me that they had no idea that a CERO rating would not qualify for an ESRB one. Or that a Japanese PSN account is needed to download the game</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I have played all the Hakuoki western releases, minus the Steam and mobile versions, but including the barebones musou clone. I also own all of the Hakuoki anime releases that Sentai has licensed in America. Shinpachi is my favorite route for myself cause he #8217;s my hot thot. For Chizuru, I think Heisuke, Yamazaki, and Souma are good matches since they are closer in age compared to some of the other guys. I like Chizuru overall but in some of the scenes, she is written to be unbelievably naive. If people are [shooting at you from a building](/s), talking to them is not really an option. On a similar note, I wish she was able to spend more time with Sen and Kimigiku for more female bonding time. The winter scenes with snow such as the snow bunny and snowball fight scenes are some of my favorites, along with Shinpachi flexing his muscles during the health exam. Since Otomate will eventually do another version, I think the game needs an end game ending list tracker or something. And I wished that some of the new romance options [did not drink the elixir](/s) as well. The anime series is a pretty good adaptation of the series that mainly focuses on Hijikata #8217;s route. The movies I think are okay but they, of course, have less time than the series or games do to tell the story. If you enjoy the historical aspects of the games, then Code:Realize is another otome game that is a period piece. It is set in Victorian London. If you like visual novels in general that do have romance but it is not the overall focus, Steins;Gate is fantastic. For non-visual novels, I would recommend Dynasty/Samurai Warriors (Chinese/Japanese action games that are fairly simple to play even on normal).</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Sucess is going to vary by company and the products themselves. Each game can have a different licensing cost and other variable costs in order to acquire the license. The cost of translating and editing the games will also differ if it is in-house (Idea factory International) or not (Aksys outsources their otome releases per several sources on Twitter). Then there is the cost of getting the games rating by the necessary software boards if releasing on platforms requiring it, marketing costs, physical production costs (which MangaGamer holds off on), and other miscellaneous costs. Now with that in mind, since Aksys has continued to release otome games, IFI has done not one but two Hakuoki Festivals, and MangaGamer has also started acquiring more otome games, I am going to say that otome games for these companies are doing well. As already mentioned, these three companies are small and will not be releasing any multimillion-selling games in the near future so bar any sort of extreme failure, I think we will continue to get English releases. I think the big question right now is with the Vita disappearing in the west (little to no shelf space, some of the other niche publishers all just about done with it or skipping Vita versions of games they are localizing, indie developers are more focused on Switch versions to go with PS4/Xbox One releases than Vita) will Aksys and IFI see if Idea Factory would be open to porting their games to other console platforms. Or are the Vita (and Steam in IFI's case) release still working for them?</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I mean considering some of the other things MangaGamer releases, I do not think those numbers for Ozmafia are terrible. Someone within the company stated that those short nukige titles they release help fund the longer projects they work on. And for console releases, I do not think any otoge series bar Hakuoki has sold over 100,000 units (Japanese copies) and that includes its ports/sequels/prequels/side stories. Most other titles hover around the 10,000 and lower range. If you know a game's name and release date, you can find its first week's sales (and other weeks possibly) on sites that post Media Create numbers.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Lol, no one who is not drunk or coked out of their mind is going to start porting otome games to the Xbox One. Microsoft seems to still have a higher minimum physical copy requirement for those who want to release their games physically compared to Nintendo or Sony. That is part of the reason Limited Run Games has not done any releases for the Xbox One and possibly why NISA never released a game on the 360 and Xbox One either. http://www.mightyrabbitstudios.com/limitedrunforums/viewtopic.php?f=2 amp;t=802#p18873 http://www.siliconera.com/2012/06/20/nis-america-wont-release-clan-champions-on-xbox-360-after-all/</TEXT>

The environment, animals, personal health reasons, etc.  gt;I would also like to know how does the diet affect you physically. It will completely depend on how one ate before being vegan and how one eats as a vegan. You could go from eating McDonald's every day to a diet incorporating veggies, fruits, and grains. You could go from eating frozen dinners every day to eating frozen vegan dinners. You could go from eating a Mediterranean diet to scarfing down Nadamoos.  gt;Lastly I is the vegan community really so bad like some people say or are they just exceptions People like to harp on their bad experiences with groups that go against the norm as it proves their assumptions and makes for good stories.</TEXT>

    <TEXT> gt; #8220;Veganism is bad for the environment. One of the leading causes of deforestation is the need for land to plant crops to meet increasing demand for vegetables. Interestingly enough, deforestation also happens to make room for livestock. And even if you are not vegan, seeing an increase in demand for vegetables should be seen as a good thing.  gt;Veganism adds to global hunger problems. The quinoa and exotic vegetables vegans rely on for nutrients come from third world nations and take food out of the hand of the nation #8217;s poor. #8221; Others have already addressed this.  gt; #8220;You won #8217;t make a difference. Sure, you get to feel all warm and fuzzy inside, but the people who sell your food, stock the shelves, transport, package, harvest, and grow your vegan food? They eat meat. They #8217;ll keep eating meat. And no amount of arguing against it will change that.  #8220; So instead of working towards structural barriers preventing people from eating less meat and more plant protein foods, we should just, give up?</TEXT>

Be it Broccoli themselves, voice actors, other people involved in the games, etc wanting more money than any localizer feels comfortable paying or that someone just does not want to let it be released overseas. The game's OPs have been unavailable to view on YouTube by western audiences, both it and Kamigami are two of the few otoge with anime adaptations that did not get dubs while all the Otomate adaptions have gotten dubs, and like you mentioned it has been popular for years but only when Klabs was involved has any game for it been released westward.</TEXT>

I could see the writing on the wall and said absolutely not. Well of course the business failed in months and he and his friends blamed me for not "contributing." I am shocked that he would ask such a thing. Your response of no was absolutely the right thing and it sounds as though he and his friends still hold this against you. You throwing your money away in that company would not have saved it, only kept it alive for a bit longer. If you want to stay with him, it is going to take a lot of therapy for him to finally realize this, especially since his friends will probably keep pushing that idea.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Finally, the Switch test begins. And it looks like unlike the PS4, it is getting one new game versus just all ports and combo packs. Code Realize seems like an easy pick for Aksys and Hakuoki seems like an easy pick for Idea Factory International. I do wonder where that leaves the PS4 Hakuoki port though, in regards to a western release. Nil Admirari has its anime being simulcast so I hope either Aksys or Idea Factory International make use of the series having some name recognition in the west.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Yes, the Vita outside of Japan is pretty much dead and few stores even have any dedicated shelf space for it. GameStop, one of the few stores still "supporting" it, has it crammed in the more section tab on their site, while the 3DS and current generation consoles have their own dedicated tabs. My only concern is that IF/Otomate said they were going to support the PS4, but barely did that. They certainly announced more titles for the Switch than the PS4 has even gotten, but the concern about that support drying up is valid.</TEXT>

    <TEXT> gt; tells me he #8217;s better than his friends cuz he #8217;s dating a pretty 18 year old, LMAO, he has a pretty big ego for someone who shouldn't. This guy is a creep and your post has so much evidence as to why. He is with you because you are a naive 18 year old who he can manipulate fairly easily by putting you on a pedestal by complimenting your age/looks while downing others. He sees you as a doll and was upset when you rightfully tried to break up because he was going to loose his doll. You need to leave before the manipulation turns for the worse. Are your parents in the picture at all? Are they not worried for your well being?</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Fairly certain workers in the meat and dairy industries are exploited (and can be undocumented) as well. I believe a study showed that pig farms in North Carolina (or another southern state) were shown to have been located closer to minority and poor communities, which can affect the health of said communities. The average omnivore still eats those same crops and I am guessing the cutoff comment is about quinoa which I believe studies have shown that South American communities were either moving away from consuming themselves and/or not a primary source of nutrition in their diets so the increased demand from westerners did not cause them to starve.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Your boyfriend befitting from nepotism is not illegal, nor is the hiring manager not responding to you regardless of her knowing you two date. As to nepotism being ethical or fair, if your boyfriend qualifies for the position and the people who selected him feel as though he can fulfill the job's duties then it seems ethical. Since you were also referred by his father, I do not think questioning the ethics matters in this scenario. Plenty of companies out there prefer to not have people in relationships working in the same location/department/etc. And there is the possibility that you do not met the job requirements or there are better candidates they want to hire.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I definitely think it is a combination of Broccoli and licensing costs. While both UtaPri and Kamigami's anime were licensed in the US (not sure about other countries) neither have dubs while just about every other otome game adaption has gotten a dub regardless on Funimation or Sentain having US rights. Several of those shows are for series with less clout than UtaPri. I believe an admin (an actual employee versus a volunteer) on the NISA game request thread about UtaPri alluded to issues being involved in bringing over UtaPri (versus just a flat out no). Others have mentioned it already but Broccoli has been known to block videos outside of Japan. I think non\-Japanese fans pirating materials be it the games or music has also soured Broccoli on the worldwide fan base.</TEXT>

MangaGamer used to include a Steam code of each purchase when you bought games on their site, but people started selling the codes, so MangaGamer stopped offering them. The fan made patches I believe add sprites from the PS3 version and other content.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Everyone already touched on the Vita, so I will touch on another aspect of your post. As mentioned, Code:Realize and the first fan disc are available in English on the PS4, with the second fan disc released on it as well, just in Japanese (for now). Now Otomate/Idea Factory has released 5 titles on the PS4, compared to 79 on the Vita, 3 for the PS3, and around 10 planned for the Switch. Not sure about other Japanese otome publishers, though D3 seems to be throwing everything on the Switch right now. If you are an English reader only, Otomate titles and D3 titles are the main titles that get localized. With Otomate switching to the Switch, I think the chances of more titles coming to the PS4 are low. The Xbox One was on life support at launch in Japan and died one or two weeks after so the chance of otome games is as likely as me becoming six feet tall. Currently at 5 feet and two inches. I still recommend getting a Vita for the otome titles currently available exclusively on it (Collar x Malice, Psychedelica, and so on). Also I hope the "get hell" comment was a joke since otome games are relatively tame unless you are looking for adult ones, which would not be allowed on consoles anyway.</TEXT>

Or that they need to have the positions filled in ten days. I think you are getting hung up on the possibility of pre-selected candidates.

A company however can easily draw a line between sexual scenarios involving adults and those involving teenagers and younger characters and which can be allowed on their platforms. PQube has a policy to not censor games and Sony made a choice to not allow this game a western localized released as is. Looking at a person and thinking they are hot is not the same as objectifying them. Sexual objectification is more than just that. Magic Mike also does not have teen actors stripping. Stripping does not even take up most of the movie time. Most of the games I play are rated T and I am not a fan of the extreme violence featured in many M rated games. Of course I am against gambling which is what loot boxes are, though as far as I know, this game does not have any.</TEXT>

On a serious note, if recruiters/employers streamlined their processes to where applicants are not having to wait weeks or more for simple things such as template rejection email, maybe applicants would be more inclined to respond.

    <TEXT>My thoughts from a similar post on here:  gt;Pot, meet kettle.  gt;  gt;On a serious note, if recruiters/employers streamlined their processes to where applicants are not having to wait weeks or more for simple things such as template rejection email, maybe applicants would be more inclined to respond. With unemployment being low and applicants knowing that recruiters/employers have no issues ghosting, applicants are able to give the latter parties a taste of their own medicine. Employers still have more power in the process so while I would not recommend ghosting, I do not feel bad for employers.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I do not think we will be getting AAA otome games anytime soon. Western otome games are mainly created by indie studios that do not have the resources (human and capital) to create one. Japanese otoge titles are typically not selling more than 10,000 copies. Collar x Malice and Collar x Malice Unlimited for example both sold between 7,000 - 8,000 units their first week. Hakuoki is one of, if not the only, otome series to sell more than 100,000 copies between the ports/sequels/fan disc/that meh musou clone. Mobile gaming moved a lot of the PSP/DS market to phones versus continuing to the Vita/3DS. Which lead to a lot of the pay per route and ftp otome titles. Down the line, I could see Hakuoki getting something similar to Stein;Gate Elite, since it also has an anime. Kind of surprised that Otomate titles have not utilized the 2.5 D (or whatever it's called) sprites that Neptunia and other Compile Heart games use.</TEXT>

I vastly prefer the latter two as some of Vestro #8217;s products are similar to Amy #8217;s Kitchen vegan frozen meals. This is not me knocking the taste or quality but that as someone who lives in a metro area versus rural, my grocery stores have many vegan frozen food options. PC/GC meals are relatively easy to make if you have stove/oven access. I think only one meal from PC really needed a food processor. If you want more variety in your meals, they both have things beyond vegan pizza/burgers. All three are pay for convenience so they are not something I subscribe to all year.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Putting aside that this person literally works for the beef industry, bringing down greenhouse gasses is not the only reason to be vegan. Animal farms take up a good portion of US land, are primarily built in lower income and minority areas, try to pass themselves off as merely small families through advertising but often are big corporations that exploit workers, and obviously harm animals. One of the responses mention people not wanting to give up their cars. I think it would be easier for the average American to reduce their animal product intake as most grocery store chains across the nation have at least beans, tofu, and at least one plant based milk to swap with animal versions. If you are not in a major city, the public transportation options are extremely limited. I live in a city that does have some public transport options, but it would take me three hours to get to work and then three hours to get back home. I live about 30 minutes away from where I work. The US is not tightly compacted into cities in many places, but instead spread out.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>After looking at the video title and getting less than 20 seconds in...  gt; "which one of these youtubers is more mentally disabled" I am not watching anymore of the video for the overt ableism. For the question of is reducetarianism stupid/unnecessary, no and I would argue the opposite. Most people cannot make a jump from omni to vegan or even vegetarian overnight. Animal products are everywhere and we have been taught from a young age that they are part of a healthy lifestyle by not just our families but by friends and medical professionals. Now some of that is changing, mainly in regards to red meat and cow based milk, but even then people are having to undo years of socialization which is hard. And the fact that companies add sugar, salt, and fat to our food to get us hooked is also an issue. It is hard to completely eliminate something one is addicted to overnight. Reducing intake of animal products overtime can make it easier for someone to switch to a vegan lifestyle down the road. And communities as a whole do not necessarily become vegan to make a difference. Vegans are not the only one reducing dairy intake and look at how that industry is panicking. Not everyone who picks up Gardein or another company's alternative meat product is vegan but having a bigger customer base allows them to expand into new stores. I would rather people reduce their animal product intake versus not changing anything at all.</TEXT>

At the end of the day, the animals are still being killed, humanely or not, after being raised for the sole purpose of being food in the animal farming industry. That aside, a planned vegan diet is just as healthy as a planned omni diet.

    <TEXT>Yes, the fan disc and the original have both done really well for Aksys which made Wintertide Miracles getting announced at this past Anime Expo seem less like a surprise and more like a guarantee. I bet that if/when Aksys does release any of the Switch ports otomate is working on, the Code Realize port will be one of the first localizations. The script is already done and the game has good word of mouth to convince newcomers to pick it up.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I think the current trend of D3 and others putting machine translation mobile ports on the Switch eShop is bad and is poisoning the well for any lesser known companies (as in not Aksys/IFI/XSEED) to localize non-Otomate titles. While I am all for more otome, it does not do the consumer any good if they have to decipher what characters should actually be saying versus what a program spit out.  #8203; With the Vita on life support in the US, I am very interested in seeing how the Switch Otomate titles do in Japan and what Aksys and IFI's otome plans are moving forward. Especially IFI's, since they would have first dibs and could possibly pick something other than the 4123rd port of Hakuoki as their first Switch release. I mean, I'll keep buying Hakuoki releases to support otomes in the West but I would like some variety.</TEXT>

Who could have guessed that? On a more serious level, no one is confused when they pick up Tofurky/Gardein/vegan store brand plant based meats/etc.. In just about every grocery store I have been in, all of them are in the produce/cold dressing section if fresh, including the nearest Whole Food's partial Beyond Burger stock. If frozen, they usually all hang out in a vegan/vegetarian section of the freezer. They also have a gazillion labels/phrases to explain that they are animal free.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I no longer play otome titles on my phone as I prefer the presentation of console/handheld otoge. Paying $20-$40 for a full game versus paying per route gives you the full story at once versus having chunks of it at a time. As mentioned by others, mobile otoge routes tend to be shorter, hence being able to sell you an epilogue, sequel, spinoff that might add up length wise to a route length in Hakuoki for example. So while mobile titles might seem less expensive on the surface, you can end up spending more than you would on a console/handheld game to reach the same amount of content. Some mobile titles, while not ugly by any means, can have this almost generic look after playing several by the same company. Otomate's titles tend to have very different looks as they utilize several artists. If you enjoy voice acting, this is more common on console/handheld games than mobile ones. Also, since you know Japanese, there are TONS of otome games available of the Vita and some PSP titles you might be able to download from the Japanese PSN Store. Otomate is also porting many titles to the Switch now as well.</TEXT>

    <TEXT> gt; I normally do not go into places like Chipotle or any of these  #8220;build your own #8221; restaurants because they are simply not vegan, and because I do not wish to support these food chains or any food merchant who\`s main revenue is from selling torture products: meat and dairy. Well good for those vegans who live in areas with multiple vegan restaurants and vegan grocery stores. For the rest of us, vegan friendly/optional businesses are pretty much our options. There are I think no more than three completely vegan restaurants where I live, with a few more that are mainly vegan with animal milk based cheese as an option. Those two combined pales in comparison to the omni restaurants that have vegan and vegetarian options. There is one vegan store, but it is not a grocery store but kind of like a general store with vegan items. Indian Trail has Cinnaholic, but it is much farther away than going to one of the closer bakeries that has vegan options or buying MovethatDough's donuts at a market that sells them.</TEXT>

The vast majority of otoges are made in Japan, by Japanese people, for Japanese women/girls, and mostly feature Japanese settings/characters/tropes. Us non-Japanese people buying otome titles and participating in the fandom is a drop in the bucket compared to the primary audience. Yes, there are some otoges made by American and other western companies/individuals. However they are just a tiny fraction of the market.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I imagine future localized titles (minus Code Realize's second fan disc and London Detective) will mainly be on other platforms than the Vita. Otomate has shifted most of their focus to the Switch, with Wand of Fortune R2 FD and White and Black Alice Twilight being the last two Vita titles they have for 2018. Variable Barricade was delayed to 2019, but I know many people are speculating it is changing platforms again. Just about every other title Otomate has announced lately is on the Switch, PC, or phones. Idea Factory International and Aksys will have plenty of titles to choose from. IFI has ported Amnesia and the Hakuoki games to Steam, so there is an audience there. With smaller PC games, there is no expectation for a physical release and even then, IFI did the limited edition for Amnesia with the Steam code. D3 and one or two other companies have already starting dumping ports of their mobile versions on the Switch eShop which signals to me that other companies want to get the otome armada's money. While a platform shift will happen, I do not think localized otome games will go the way of the dinosaur.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Realistically, I think the Switch version of Hakuoki is a safe bet since IFI has already localized the Vita versions. Maybe the PS4 version too since it exists. Both versions are already out in Japan so there is no waiting for the game to get completed before starting the localization process, unlike several of Compile Heart #8217;s titles. The other switch titles that have been localized in Vita form, Norn and Code Realize, were done by Aksys. While Aksys  #8220;lost #8221; Hakuoki when IFI was created I would imagine Code Realize #8217;s success for Aksys could have led them to secure future titles under the IP. Norn I am not too sure about. The other port is Nil, which neither game has been localized. I am not sure if IFI would have to split it for a western release so they do not spend the time and resources of both games in case it underperforms for them. Though that would add more cartridge costs. Cendrillion I would be excited to hear about being localized since it is a new title and does not have any  #8220;baggage #8221; of a fan disc, sequel, or similar things in its Switch release.</TEXT>

    <TEXT> gt; There are a billion badly translated hentai games on steam While their titles have pretty good localizations, MangaGamer, which releases both non-pornographic titles and nukige ones has stated before that bar well-known IPs such as Higurashi, the explicit titles are what bring in the money to fund more unique localizations. So while I am not interested in Boob Wars, it keeps the lights on for them. Other localizers probably see similar results. Those ecchi Sakura games that Winged Cloud releases and similar titles are priced cheaper than full-length titles such as Hakuoki or a non-otoge such as Steins;Gate. They also gain traction quicker as some streamers like to purchase and play them for the lols.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>[Some thought it would keep boys from masturbating:](https://qz.com/885018/why-is-circumcision-so-popular-in-the-us/)  gt; At the time, surgical interventions of all kinds were becoming more popular, owing to better anesthesia and greater concern over cleanliness, which reduced hospital contagion. Doctors began recommending the operation as part of the neonatal routine. Not only did the procedure prevent phimosis, but it was also believed to make the penis more hygienic and less tempting for wayward masturbating boys (a notion that might have been quashed by something known as the scientific method). As David Gollaher explains in his book *Circumcision: A History of the World #8217;s Most Controversial Surgery,* a circumcised penis swiftly became a mark of distinction, a sign of good breeding, sound hygiene and the best medicine money could buy.  #8203;</TEXT>

They are story driven, which I enjoy, and are a nice change of pace after playing an action game.  gt; Do you feel like they substitute anything in your real life for you? Like how I will never be a globe-trotting explorer, I will never poison to the touch.  gt; Are you currently in a real life relationship/have you been in one within the past few years? I started playing otome games before I got into my current (and first) relationship.  gt; What's the biggest appeal of an otome game for you? Stories that right now I do not think will be done in AAA games.  gt; Does the format of a game influence your enjoyment of it (ie: mobile, Vita, PC, etc)? I honestly prefer games in general either on handhelds (PS Vita/3DS) and consoles (PS4/Switch/etc.) over PC and mobile gaming. I have never been a big PC gamer (got into gaming through Mario and Pokemon) and the cost to complete a mobile otome game can end up costing more than a handheld title and still have less content.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>From the NYT article linked in the Hill one:  gt; The idea for the ban was first proposed by Ben Weyts, a right-wing Flemish nationalist and the minister in the Flanders government who is responsible for animal welfare. Mr. Weyts was heavily criticized in 2014 for attending the 90th birthday of Bob Maes, who had collaborated with the Nazi occupation of Belgium in World War II and later became a far-right politician. So this is less for the animals and more to antagonize Jewish and Muslim people in Belgium.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Fuck the car insurance of the dude who rear-ended me and my mom last week. It might not have been your personal responsibility to get me a rental car, but it sure the hell is the responsibility of the company you work for! And telling me to take an Uber, when the insurance company would only cover $30 a day was irritating too. Uber's price estimator puts just the drive to work at just about that and I am not sure if that even takes into account surge pricing. And of course, we have to rush through the process of getting myself another car. Thankfully there are several of the same make and models of it around the Charlotte. Just upset that new front tires were put on it last month and that I made my most recent car payment the day before the crash. Glad that I and my mother are okay though.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>There are many out there due to misinformation think that veganism is closely tied to gluten-free. It does not help when a lot of companies selling vegan products will heavily market their naturally (as in none of the ingredients would ever contain gluten) gluten-free products as such. While I understand that millions do suffer from Celiac's Disease and similar conditions, much of the marketing is done for trendiness, not to help people with those conditions.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Limited Run Games #8217; focus is on small quantities of physical copies of games that the original publisher/developer passed on creating physical copies of. They primarily sell directly to consumers versus selling to stores. A good portion of their releases are indie games that I would guess the original publishers/developers could not afford the costs of physical distribution. In XSEED #8217;s case, they most like other western publishers, moved on from physical Vita releases and did not want to pay to print copies and worry about them not getting sold.</TEXT>

Highlights - All the customization options, how good the game looks compared to the DS games, the animal variety, and crop variety. Lowlights - No in-game tracker to measure treats given for animal productivity, the small limit for animal/character/farm names, and how long it can take to wait for black lumber and other foraging materials to appear to build things.</TEXT>

Similar to how the DS got DS and DS Cute before IoH. The HAKAMA site lists RF4S, RF5, and some other title, while not adding in the FoMT remake into the last "working title" box. The related Twitter account has tweeted out things for those three titles but nothing for FoMT as far as I can tell.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Isn't one of the goals in Save the Homeland to save the entire island? And what is the cutoff for a game to be considered old because IoH, MM, DS, and AP are all over a decade old and rely on the player to help restore a village/save the goddess. Gameplay-wise, I think we will continue to get similar town/farm building mechanics because it allows the developers to lengthen the game while allowing the players to decide when they want to take on certain tasks and giving rewards for completing said tasks. I will note here that I have no experience with the games Natsume is developing under the Harvest Moon name. Story-wise I think the developers are continuing that theme and/or having a more complex story besides "your grandpa/dad/other older man in your life died so take his land" in the newer games because games as a whole are trying to have more complex stories to get the players invested in. Obviously, they are very different developers but comparing Naughty Dogs' Uncharted 1 to The Last of Us (or even Uncharted 4 if we want to keep it in the same series) story-wise, U1 is just Indiana Jones the Game while there is a much bigger emphasis on the story in the latter title. Pokemon would also work in this example with RBY having a very simple story while SM/USUM have much more to say.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Natsume is not the creator of the Bokumo Monogatari franchise. They own the rights to the Harvest Moon title, which they have been slapping on their mobile-eque farming games the past few years. Marvelous holds the rights to the franchise and now has their US branch, XSEED, localizing the games under the Story of Seasons title. I highly doubt Natsume has rights over any character designs of titles they localized in the past, considering that SoS had returning candidates from ToTT present in the English version and they looked relatively the same.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Considering that XSEED has not shown the game off in any form, they most likely have not started working heavily on the localization so there is no English script at the moment. Most games do not get patched with scripts from other languages after they are released. The only exception I can think of at the moment is the Ace Attorney Trilogy HD port.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>XSEED is a small branch of Marvelous that finished up the Daemon X Machina localization for Nintendo of America earlier this year and has been working on other projects such as several Corpse Party Steam and Switch releases, Senran Kagura releases, the Travis Strikes Again releases, the Grand Blue Versus localization, and some smaller projects. I know a lot of people in this subreddit might only play the SoS/RF titles they localize, but those are not the only titles XSEED works on. They also have the Rune Factory 4 Special release which has added bits that have to be work on so they could not merely dump the script from the 3DS version in and call it a day. There is also the fact that one of the voice actors in the game had all of his inappropriate actions over the years become expose so they might have decided to redo all of the character's voice work so he will not be associated with this updated version. And even if they decided not to redo the voicework, they still most likely had internal staff meetings discussing the option. I would rather XSEED wait until they have a good idea as to when the game will be released to announce a date than them announce one far in advance that they most likely will not meet. Otherwise, they announce a release date too soon and then people get angry and upset when they announce they had to pushback the game's release date. XSEED does a really great job at localizing the titles and I would rather wait longer than have a quick turn around time and end up with some illegible mess like NISA's Ys 8 release or some of Natsume's old localizations.</TEXT>

    <TEXT> gt;6. What Marvelous did is considered a jerk move by Japanese standards. From an American perspective, having XSeed localize the games is completely logical. From a Japanese standpoint, you don't turn your back on a loyal partner.  gt;  gt;"The Japanese, for example, define business ethics in terms of loyalty to their companies, their business networks, and their nation."  gt;  gt;[https://hbr.org/1996/09/values-in-tension-ethics-away-from-home](https://hbr.org/1996/09/values-in-tension-ethics-away-from-home #8221;) This person seems to imply that Marvelous should be blindly loyal to a company that made mistakes consistently when releasing Bokumo titles in the west. I would argue that the constant typos, mistranslations, added glitches/bugs, and removal of features are Natsume abusing the trust Marvelous had in them. On the subject of removing features, I guarantee Natsume would remove same-sex marriage in the Friends of Mineral Town, as they did with DS Cute #8217;s BF system. That would be a huge PR nightmare for Marvelous.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>The mobile gaming market really changed the gaming landscape drastically. [The 3DS and Vita have both sold less than half of what their predecessors sold.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_best-selling_game_consoles#Handheld_game_consoles) Phone gaming back when the DS and PSP launched was pretty much Snake and other simple games that could be played with a few buttons on a phone's keypad. Phones now are capable of so much more, both on a technical level and visual level. Since people were already buying smartphones for either work or getting them via their phone provider's upgrade plans, more casual players have no reason to go out and buy a dedicated gaming device. This affected a lot of titles that fall into a few categories: 1. Aimed at casual gamers (ex: Brain Age and Nintendogs, [which both had sales drop-offs from DS to 3DS](https://www.nintendo.co.jp/ir/en/finance/software/ds.html)) 2. Does not need the capabilities of a dedicated device to work properly (ex: otome games and rhythm games) 3. Could easily change its format to fit on a phone better (ex: shovelware titles that now litter app stores used to be on the DS as a $30 physical release) Otome titles are not the only games I play, so I bought a PSP, Vita, and Switch for games that will never come to phones. However, I can easily see why a Japanese otome player who only bought, let us say no more than 10 otome titles for her PSP throughout its active life decided to skip buying a Vita and instead downloads the phone otome titles to play on her commute. Sure, a lot of phone releases (not just otome ones) are highly addictive/manipulative and can end up with people spending thousands of dollars on them. Most casual players will spend less though, especially if they only buy routes for one dude versus the \~$60 entry price for a Vita/Switch release then another $200+ for the console. Since the Japanese market is flooded with phone otome titles, I do think it would be wise for Japanese countries to look into releasing more of their titles outside of Japan. I know that Hakuoki on Vita did get an Asian release and Aksys is releasing some of the Otomate titles (some of which got multilanguage releases by another company on Steam). Still, I think some companies are leaving money on the table. Who knows, maybe they could end up in a similar situation to the most recent works of [Uchikoshi.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kotaro_Uchikoshi) His games in the Zero Escape series did not do too hot in Japan. However, the games did much better in the west and fan support helped get the third game out of cancellation. His most recent title, Ai the Somnium files did not rank on either PS4 or Switch its first week in Japan but [its western PC version was one of the best selling games by revenue on Steam during its release month.](http://archive.ph/2019.12.28-165246/https://store.steampowered.com/sale/2019_top_new)</TEXT>

This release of Wintertide Miracles was announced by Otomate very recently and does have new content so it would require more work to release it in English than Guardians of Rebirth and Future Blessings.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Aksys: I think we will get updates on progress for Piofiore and Cafe Enchante, such as their release dates and any day 1/limited editions they may have. Even though it was just announced and has new content that would need to be localized, Wintertide Miracles seems like a safe bet. Especially if Aksys and Otomate/Idea Factory/Design Factory have an agreement where Aksys can secure the rights to ports of titles they have already localized. If any new titles are announced I think it would be Olympia Soiree. Idea Factory International: Since they have done nothing since the Hakuoki releases, I am expecting nothing. Would nice to be surprised though. On the Compile Heart side they have a Neptunia port and Mary Skelter so maybe they could throw us a bone with the Hakuoki and Amnesia Switch ports. To be honest it is really frustrating that IFI has first dibs on Otomate titles but seems hesitant to do release anymore. Mangagamer: Update on the F Me Royalty release. Honestly I have no idea of what PC otome releases there are that would be viable right now. PQube: They have not released otome titles in the past but this Tweet does show them as willing - https://mobile.twitter.com/PQubeAsia/status/1254129053902258179 The Spike Chunsoft USA and 5pb/Mages partnership for the science adventure releases did take away a good portion of their potential work so branching out could be a good replacement. XSEED: They are rather busy right now with other releases and with the eventual English version of Rune Factory 5 I would rather they not pick up anything else right now that is text heavy. Koei Tecmo: They have given  #8220;we will look into it #8221; statements about localizing Ruby Party titles in the past but who knows if they actually will. Sekai Project: Would prefer them to finish what they have already started. Spike Chunsoft USA: I will forgive them for KBO if they localize this - https://mobile.twitter.com/gensomanege</TEXT>
