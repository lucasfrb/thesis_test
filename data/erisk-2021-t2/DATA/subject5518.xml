    <DATE>2019-04-03 00:32:14</DATE>
    <TEXT>Not sure if this has been posted yet, or if anybody has seen it. But the VA for Itsuki did an ASMR video a few days ago. I thought it was pretty awesome, especially with headphones on. Not sure if I can post the link though but I #8217;ll try [Itsuki ASMR video](https://youtu.be/4VZXKkLxBhM)</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I #8217;m just curious if anybody on here has built their own garage/resin kit and what the experience was like. I #8217;m thinking about building and painting my own soon when I pickup supplies. Also, what kind of paint works best? I #8217;m leaning more towards acrylics, but I #8217;m guessing any plastic modeling paint will work.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I remember seeing it on GOG I think when I was looking at the different point and click horror games. It #8217;s one where you play as the murder/abductor and go around his creepy dark house looking at different things. It stuck with me because the pictures you look at are realistic ones with pictures of blood and crime scenes. The gameplay video shows the guy going around the house looking at the different pictures then finally going down a hallway and pulling out a girl that #8217;s been tied up from a room. I #8217;m pretty sure it #8217;s from GOG but I #8217;m having a hard time finding it again.</TEXT>

I really liked how both Yuno and Satou were really smart and always figured out when someone was up to something, or able to cover their tracks. It made both those series really enjoyable. I #8217;d even take manga suggestions too. I have both the Manga Rock and Manga Reader apps if they are on there.</TEXT>

    <DATE>2019-09-11 00:58:21</DATE>
    <TEXT>I #8217;m searching for anime with smart banter between the characters. I guess the genre would be in the romance or drama realm. So far the only two I #8217;ve seen that have these type of conversations in them are Bunny Girl Senpai and Time of Eve. I #8217;ve heard that the Monogatari series has extremely fast dialogue between the characters.</TEXT>

    <DATE>2019-09-14 01:21:27</DATE>
    <TEXT>For me I would say that my top three are: 1. Cop Craft. My top one due to the relationship of the main characters and their development. The story is pretty solid and the action keeps things interesting. Reminds me of GATE which is one of my favorites. 2. O #8217; Maidens in your Savage Season. This one is cute, cringy, and hilarious, all at the same time. You #8217;re taken through the story of girls figuring out their feelings, and dealing with the awkwardness of it all right with them. It has cliffhangers that make you say  #8220;oh shit! #8221; And it keeps things going week by week. 3. Magical Sempai. Funny anime, even though it is short. You can #8217;t help but cringe as she messes up her magic tricks. And then you feel bad for her, while also having a confused boner at the positions she ends up in.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Ah yeah, basically Happy Sugar Life in a nutshell. It seems it #8217;s often like you said, they know what they #8217;re doing is wrong. But they just don #8217;t know any other option, or ways to express what they want to. Im not sure I #8217;ve ever seen a yandere character have other traits like embarrassment or shyness. If the MC in an anime or manga just went up and kissed the crazy girl for no reason, I don #8217;t think she would get all flustered and hit the guy. Well maybe get a little embarrassed... or if her character had a history of abuse, but she most likely wouldn #8217;t hit him like a tsundere would. I don #8217;t think so at least. It would be awesome to have a manga or anime where the MC just goes with it. He deals with all her craziness and doesn #8217;t mind her. You know like how some characters tease the tsundere girl just to see her get all worked up? Something like that, an MC that has no problem with girls and knows how they act. Like Arata from Trinity Seven but with a yandere girl.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I #8217;m thinking I might go with masking off the whole figure, and lightly sanding the top coat. In the original promotional pictures for the figure the paint looks really shiny. I #8217;m guessing that they used a clear gloss coat for the finish. We don #8217;t have any hobby stores in my area. But we have a ton of hardware stores, and I #8217;m sure they have lots of spray paint. I #8217;ll take a look around. I #8217;ve heard some paints react badly with PVC plastic.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Ah nice, there #8217;s an Auto Zone literally right down the street. I #8217;ll check and see if they have it. You said that you usually do airbrushing. Have you ever tried decanting the paint from spray paint and using it in your airbrush? It looks like it helps with more precise painting. I #8217;ve never tried it, but it looked interesting.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Anime: Denpa Teki na Kanojo [OVA Part 1 of 2 on YouTube ](https://youtu.be/hhBnUDJyBX0) Im not really sure if Ame (pictured) is a full on yandere though. I think she #8217;s just has a bit of the Rikka Takanashi chuuibyou going on. She #8217;s devoted to the MC, but not really obsessively. But others in the show definitely are crazy.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Im looking for more anime with adult and mature themes. Something like Elfen Lied, RIN: Daughters of Mnemosyne, and Claymore. I really like the dark and gritty anime, so any recommendations are good. I have already seen Higurashi, Parasyte, Terraformers, Future Diaries, and Happy Sugar Life.</TEXT>

It #8217;s one where the MC wakes up from an accident or something, but the world around him is all blood and guts, even the people. And that #8217;s all he can see.

    <TEXT>Nice! Yeah it #8217;s interesting. It seems for the 1/4 figures the really niche titles go up in price, but the older production figures go down. And with other scales the niche ones are cheaper but the older productions sky rocket. I was looking at a School Days Kotonoha figure and the price was insane. $200+shipping for a 1/8th scale. Is it normal for people to keep figures in their boxes?? As soon as I get mine I #8217;m tearing (not really) the box open to display them. I mean, I keep the box, but I don #8217;t leave the figure inside of it. I #8217;m happy to display them.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Nice! That #8217;s a very good comparison of them. I #8217;ve been looking around lately but there #8217;s so many different options! I #8217;d like my next bunny to be a standing one, so I #8217;m looking around for either the [Kurisu Makise](https://www.goodsmile.info/en/product/7542/Kurisu+Makise+Bunny+Ver.html) Bunny, or the [Katou Megumi](https://www.goodsmile.info/en/product/6612/Megumi+Kato+Bunny+Ver.html) Bunny. I found a person in the UK selling Megumi for around $170 shipped. ($120+$50 shipping to the US) which seems alright. But I #8217;m holding out for Kurisu, I haven #8217;t seen the Steins Gate VN or Anime yet, but there #8217;s something about the character design I like.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Nice! That figure looks pretty awesome. I #8217;ve always liked the look of the small clear stands they use for the stock pictures. It looks way cleaner. There #8217;s one I #8217;ve seen where it #8217;s the exact same pose, but she #8217;s wearing a white lab coat with a bottle of Dr Pepper instead of the phone.</TEXT>

I read their FAQ page and it says up to three weeks before shipping they will charge your card. Im sure some stores are different, but if thats the case, then damn, I'll order.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Did you cancel your preorder? Or just didn #8217;t receive your package? Yeah I #8217;ve seen the recent prices sellers have, and they #8217;re insane! 1/4 Vanilla is at least $300+shipping. Maybe there will be a reissue or a new design hopefully. They #8217;re pretty popular figures so I don #8217;t see why they wouldn #8217;t. I #8217;ve noticed that Native is really limited in their selection of figures they put out, unless you get secondhand older ones. But the handful of new ones they release are really detailed and have a nice paint job. I #8217;m pretty impressed with what they have to offer, I #8217;d say they #8217;re worth the preorder price.</TEXT>

Any of their original characters or ones designed by Tony (their illustrator) are going to be high quality and high price. For the most part, they #8217;re mostly lewd though.

    <TEXT>I just got the [FREEing 1/4 Veronica](https://myfigurecollection.net/item/676240) . Even though she #8217;s kneeling, if you put her next to the 1/7 and 1/8 scales with their stands, she STILL is taller than them. By a good 3 inches at least. I can #8217;t imagine how tall the standing bunny figures are. 1/4 are worth it in my opinion. I #8217;d rather have a few 1/4, than a lot of other scales at this point. You can easily find used ones. Check EBay, Ami Ami, and Akiba Soul if you #8217;re in the US. Akiba has tons of used ones and flat rate 5.99 shipping per figure. They even have +18 figures too.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>The previous owner sun damaged the clear coat on her ears. I was willing to do some work to fix them anyway, but it looked way worse in the pictures than it does in person. Unless you look from a foot away and the light hits them just right, it #8217;s barely noticeable. Besides that there #8217;s just a very small hole in the tights. I guess the owner thought people wouldn #8217;t be interested, because he was selling her for WAY cheaper than anywhere else. Got her for $53 shipped from Japan.

    <TEXT>I just binged and finished both seasons last week! I loved it! I even got a Sena figure. I #8217;ve been looking around for a Rika figure but I haven #8217;t been able to find one. The roller coaster scene was the most hilarious thing I #8217;ve ever seen in anime so far!!  #8220;Rika #8217;s losing it! #8221; Would you say that Oregairu is the most similar to it? They both seem really similar</TEXT>

    <DATE>2019-10-24 10:32:55</DATE>
    <TEXT>My personal favorite is the transition scenes they have in Seitokai Yakuindomo. In the first episode there #8217;s a scene where they pan the  #8220;camera #8221; through the school, down the hallway, up the stairs, through peoples legs and arms. All while the characters themselves are moving. It really was cinematic and seemed like they really put a ton of work into just 10 seconds. On top of that, every background character has really good clothing animations, and movements when they could have gotten away with less.</TEXT>

It #8217;s an older anime now, and it #8217;s sad that it #8217;s not more well known. There was only one produced pre painted figure of her (this one, which went on a 40-50% off sale almost immediately from what I could tell), and only two garage kits. But I #8217;m happy with her. She #8217;s the only figure I have on my desk because she doesn #8217;t take up that much space, and she #8217;s nice to look at.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Maybe. But I doubt it. I #8217;ve only been watching anime for around 9 months now. I used to make fun of the people in my school who watched it, because it just seemed corny to me. The exaggerated poses and expressions always seemed weird to me. Now it #8217;s like a whole world opened up. I had a bad depression last year. So one day looking for something to watch, I stumbled upon Elfen Lied on Amazon. Deep end for sure!! But it was amazing. For some reason it just connected with me. All the emotions that anime has are just something that doesn #8217;t translate well in Hollywood films and shows. But with anime you can get so absorbed in the story and characters. Anyway, after EL, I moved on to Fate/Zero. After that I started watching more. Eventually I bought a few figures. Now I have 13 figures, a poster, played a couple VNs, and I #8217;ve seen around 50 or so anime. I have a huge plan to watch list from a lot of anime that I #8217;ve never seen or heard about before. So I don #8217;t think I #8217;ll stop anytime soon! Maybe eventually something else will take over, but not for awhile. Edit: I grew up watching the dubbed versions of Pokemon, Yu Gi Oh, and Dragon Ball. I think most everyone on here has, but that was about it. I didn #8217;t seriously start watching until recently.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Eh it #8217;s okay every once and awhile. I tend to like the more dark anime, but occasionally I #8217;ll watch the fan service just to switch things up. Recently I watched Freezing! and for all the low ratings it got I liked it. It was a good mix of ecchi and  #8220;holy crap that woman just got sliced in half! #8221; It was basically soft core hentai. Main girl has huge tits that constantly get groped by classmates. Every girls clothes find a way to get torn off in battle ect., but it was pretty dark too. Good compromise.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>It #8217;s supposed to be about 15-18 minutes There #8217;s like 30 or so questions My GM told everybody about it. It #8217;s interesting that for being an  #8220;anonymous #8221; survey you still have to use your employee ID and legal first name to even get started with it. Kinda suspicious. Unless it #8217;s just to keep track of whether you completed it or not. For as much as my GM, Tech sup, assistant manager, and my coworkers are decent. I do have some problems, so I answered honestly. If that #8217;s a problem for them, so be it. It seems like most stores have an extremely high turnover rate. In the two years I #8217;ve been at mine we lose at least 5 people a year. Actually now that I think about it one of our P amp;M associates is leaving next week. Lucky guy. I know I #8217;m not sticking around for much longer. For the last two years, all I #8217;ve done is freight and stock shelves. There #8217;s been no talk about training for print or tech. Instead of cross training in house, our manager just hires new people, and trains them just for one department (P amp;M usually), and leaves the ones with experience hanging around in OS. Then they leave, and the cycle continues. One of the guys I work with has been just a cashier for about four years. Low pay, cut hours ( I #8217;m down to three days a week), maddening work environment with crappy music, and brain dead customers. I #8217;m taking off come spring.</TEXT>

    <DATE>2020-01-10 04:32:59</DATE>
    <TEXT>I #8217;ve always thought it would be awesome to have some anime characters meet and get to know each other. Isekai Quartet did this, but more characters and genres would be epic. I #8217;m not sure if it would happen though, unless there was some sort of collaboration between the studios. Even just short 2-3 episode OVAs would be amazing though. I just thought about this after remembering that one video where all the characters are sitting and walking around in the bar.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I tried watching a dub and it was horrendous. I think it #8217;s because of the way they sound. Most of the actors voices they choose for characters just don #8217;t fit in my opinion, especially the female characters. Like you have a 25+ woman trying to sound like a 16 yo teenager. One time watching Haruhi dubbed I noticed they tried to use some idioms and slang that must have either got lost in translation or used for fun, and it just felt forced and didn #8217;t fit very well. Also, the timing just feels off. You can tell there #8217;s edits and pauses sometimes. The voices just work better in Japanese, and the conversation flow is nicer to me.</TEXT>

Shes not physically abusive, instead, she WANTS to be with the MC, and actively tries. But every time she attempts to tell him, her pride and her nerves get in the way. Then, she ends up running away in embarrassment. [This scene](https://youtu.be/kxufPzz_Ew8?t=167) in particular was very well done. She tries so hard! I-its not like I like her or anything though!

    <TEXT>Ah yeah true. I actually wonder if theres an manga out there of a person taking advantage of a yandere that likes them because of their influence on them. It seems like a pretty interesting concept. I wonder if they would realize it or if they would be blind to it. Id imagine they wouldnt care as long as they are getting attention.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I love this anime. Literally within the first 8 minutes Kotoko casually tossed in about 5 off handed jabs at Saki. Shes a smug savage! "Since he was dumped so cruelly by someone who WAS his type. I think its quite possible for him to seek the complete opposite." "Since he's not getting married to YOU, he's not in a rush to get a job anymore." " You did run away from Kuro-senpai after all." Like, damn! That smug cat mouth she makes is awesome.  #8203; The soundtrack is interesting as well. It feels like it belongs in an RPG fantasy game or something, but I like it. It fits very well during the conversations.</TEXT>

    <DATE>2020-02-18 03:26:18</DATE>
    <TEXT>I was recently gifted two pads of Canson paper. One is 11x14 Sketch (Red) and the other is Drawing (green). I figure if I just put paper under each sheet I should be okay right? I #8217;m not sure about blend ability. They both are pretty smooth, just not as thick as Marker or Bristol paper would be.</TEXT>

    <DATE>2020-02-18 23:32:55</DATE>
    <TEXT>Its been awhile since Ive seen it, I thought it was [Imouto Succubus](https://www.pornhub.com/view_video.php?viewkey=ph5d48497fb8807), but it had about three episodes and all three had the same succubus character. She tries to basically get his semen as her life force and pretty much tries to kill him, but at the third episode she gets attached to him. I remember the scenes were in a dark room. maybe it was \^ But I could have sworn the succubus was a bit different.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I remember the figure was a female witch with a large hat, but the face was more realistic. Had orange hair and I think she was leaning on a tree branch in a puddle of water, with a skeleton head. It looked similar to [this one.](https://www.hype.tokyo/products/dragons-crown-orchidseed-1-7-scale-figure-sorceress) But less lewd, and the stand had more detail. I remember seeing it on here and people were saying that she had leaning issues overtime. But I've not been able to find it. I'll do some more searches.</TEXT>

At least that way I can be a tiny bit productive and try to bring them to life, at least on paper. As far as I know I #8217;ve been doing this for about 15 years.

    <TEXT>I kept getting chills whenever the battle themes came up for both Attack on Titan and Kabaneri of the Iron Fortress. Eye-Water from AoT on its own is amazing. I think Kill la Kill is one of his best though. Coming up with an individual song for each of the characters, then figuring out the timing, and getting them to work together couldn't have been easy. Nui Harime's theme song when it first played had to be one of the most intense things in an anime I've heard. Everything he's done just works so well. I've been meaning to watch Seraph of the End as well but haven't got around to it.</TEXT>

    <TITLE>Anime scene where the MC and a girl escape from a crazy school club trip in the woods?</TITLE>
    <DATE>2020-04-11 09:52:24</DATE>
    <TEXT>For the life of me I can #8217;t remember the name of the anime. But I remember the MC and a girl get roped into going on this school club trip way out in the woods. But the members there a little bit crazy. They manage to get a key and escape through a window or a door or something and run into their teacher on the way out? I think... It #8217;s been awhile since I #8217;ve seen it.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I remember watching an anime awhile ago and this scene stuck out to me, but I cant remember which one it is for the life of me. I think the MC and a group of girls were staying at a cabin or an abandoned house, and they were all sleeping. One of the girls had to get up to use the bathroom but she was too scared to go alone, so she woke up the MC and had him stand outside the door. Then when they get back, another girl says she has to use the bathroom and has him stand outside, but she asks him if he is there like five times. Then when they get back to the room the camera shows one of the girls pretending to sleep, but she wants to ask him too, and is too shy.</TEXT>

I #8217;ve already seen Asobi Asobase, Seitokai, Wasteful Days, Haganai... But any suggestions would be welcome.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Isla is one of my favorite characters. Her expressions during the whole series literally made the show for me. I also noticed how for each op, her expression changes during the last five seconds of each one. Sometimes it #8217;s happy.. other times it #8217;s sad. I thought that was pretty cool.</TEXT>

My Little Monster looks good too. Haven #8217;t really watched drama anime, the art style definitely is different. It seems a lot brighter color wise.. and the characters, especially the guys, look like they #8217;re 7 feet tall! I suppose it #8217;s part of the style though.

    <TEXT>[Spoilers] I got completely lost during the second season. I have no idea why she got so mad at him for the whole fake confession thing, or why the whole season turned into a drama fest because of it. The first season was awesome and actually interesting. But I had no idea what was going on for the second one. Yukino kinda started getting annoying later on, I get that her whole character is supposed to have trouble communicating or understanding feelings. But I don #8217;t get why they couldn #8217;t make the situation have way less drama and passive aggression.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>A week ago the promotional trailer got me interested, and I ordered the first volume of the manga. I'm about halfway through and I'm loving it so far. I have the second volume on the way, and really excited for the anime! The fact that the VA did the voice for Satania will make it amazing. Cant wait. As a side note: I'm kind of interested to see what D #333;jinshi artists will turn it into. They could make it really dark if they wanted to. Uzaki wants to hangout because her home life is abusive and she has no friends or something.. then she spirals down a dark path, and....oh no.</TEXT>

The circle isn #8217;t just the face, but it #8217;s also part of the hair too. Then they do a v shape for the chin and divide it up for the eyes and nose and all that. Did you do that as well?

    <DATE>2020-06-20 04:36:37</DATE>
    <TEXT>If you guys are interested I just found a YouTuber who has posted videos of interviews with a bunch of different manga artists. Basically the author of Monster, Naoki Urasawa, travels around and meets with them. The cool part is that they place cameras in their studios and record them working. Afterwards Naoki and the artist review the video and talk about different things like their techniques or inspiration.

    <TEXT>Yeah that #8217;s what everyone in that sub was saying. Irl it would probably get stolen, or would get you shot. But in anime, wouldn #8217;t your average Yandere girl be able to handle a thief though? I doubt she would let her phone get stolen. After all, it has all those precious voyeuristic pictures of you, and messages you sent! Lol Could just be put in a purse or something too I guess, instead of hanging out of a pocket.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Yuno Gasai from the anime Future Diary She #8217;s one of the main characters in it, and she has a yandere personality. Actually she #8217;s one of the most iconic yanderes. (Might be the first mainstream one?) Anyway, it #8217;s a good anime! Recommend it.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I finished it awhile ago. But I just started reading it randomly one day after seeing the cover. I have a thing for fit, athletic, anime girls so it seemed right up my alley. I have to say I actually liked it. For some reason the behavior of the characters in it sort of reminded me of the relationship Eren and Mikasa have from AoT.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Ive honestly lost count of how many times I #8217;ve been asked that. It just blows my mind. How many other people do you see organizing items on a shelf lady? Maybe they just can #8217;t come up with a better opener.. I suppose it #8217;s better than the one worded  #8220;Ink. #8221; or  #8220;Pencils. #8221; they fire off after they ignore your hello when you #8217;re on register. Definitely better than being whistled at too. Next time that happens I #8217;m just going to say  #8220;I #8217;m not a dog dumbass, want to try again? #8221; It #8217;s getting to the point where I just don #8217;t care. At least 75% of the customers that I see are assholes. The amount of times I #8217;ve been glared and scowled at for just trying to help them figure out a problem is insane. Dude, don #8217;t get pissed at me because you can #8217;t explain what you need and I have to ask. Retail is horrible for mental health.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I know that things are over exaggerated in anime. I #8217;ve never had a classmate wear bandages or an eyepatch, but is it supposed to be a common thing? I get that it could be a thing for elementary kids, like playing and fighting at recess. But in middle and highschool, the most I #8217;ve ever seen that #8217;s similar is the girl always wearing black in class, or the quiet guys and girls reading or drawing. Nothing as extreme as them acting out scenes or fights in public. Maybe my schools were just boring? Never had anybody claim to be the half breed of a race of dragons, or challenge anyone to a duel or anything. I would think most people past elementary school would keep the fantasies and daydreams in their head? Anyway, just curious. What have been your experiences?</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Yeah I definitely could see it being used as a coping mechanism or mental illness. I think they actually touched on that in the first couple episodes of And You Never Thought There Was a Girl Online. Where (spoiler) the main girl literally thought the MC was actually the character from her game, and how thrown off the other two characters were after they realized she couldn #8217;t tell reality apart. Just because she was lonely and got attached. Just curious, but that guy that acted like a vampire. Is he the one that wore a trench coat and yelled at another person for talking about the masquerade? I swear I saw a post here awhile ago about this. Haha</TEXT>

    <TITLE>Wasteful Days of High School Girls is an underrated comedy</TITLE>
    <DATE>2020-06-26 07:08:56</DATE>
    <TEXT>I think the reason why is because it got released the same time as Dr. Stone and Fire Force. I just finished a second run last week, and I still loved it. Every single one of the characters, all nine, are just so damn hilarious. The banter between all of them made me laugh so hard. Though the three main girls; Robo, Wota, and Baka are great... I think the anime really shines with the side characters. For instance, Saku "L\*li" Momoi is a high schooler whose short height gets her called cute constantly. You think she seems like a pure and innocent girl who has no idea about half the lewd things the other girls are saying. But she surprises you when she doesnt hesitate to refer to all of them as "You Bastards!" Gradually, as more girls get introduced, you start to pick up on each of their quirks and you just love them for it. I wont spoil anything for those that havent seen it, but its also highly recommended to stay after the credits too for extra laughs. You'll soon find out that Yamamoto is best girl. Give it a watch!</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Ah yeah that #8217;s the one! Thanks! Along with Steins Gate I also got 0, Chaos Child, and Crimson Gray. I just started last week but I #8217;m liking VNs so far. Crimson Gray looked interesting since the main girl is a yandere. There was another one on Steam that looked good. I think it #8217;s like a detective one where you try to solve murders. Supposed to be pretty gruesome. Kara no Shojo</TEXT>

    <TEXT>It never fails to amaze me how looking at some figures from AmiAmi, and even sellers from japan on eBay, they ALWAYS document every little scratch and dent on a box. I could care less if the box comes a little damaged or scratched. But I guess the hardcore collectors might care? Maybe that #8217;s just part of Japan #8217;s culture? I ordered a doujin from Japan on eBay and it was VERY meticulously wrapped. I #8217;m talking it had a plastic sleeve. Then it was wrapped in foam and taped to a piece of hard cardboard. Then it was placed in the packing envelope. They even included an origami crane which was a nice touch! They really go the extra mile there.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Being my first VN I was kind of annoyed by how deep they buried the True Ending and how you needed a guide. But I #8217;m actually glad they did. I was able to get all the endings and experience some things I would have missed otherwise. My first run through I accidentally blanked out and had forgot that the red square meant to open your phone for the D-Mail in chapter 6. Ended up getting Suzuhas ending. My second run I started from scratch and followed the guide and saved at the start of every chapter. Instead of overwriting... I know.. I know.. I actually liked Faris #8217; ending. For some reason it felt like a fresh start. Hers, and the True Ending were my top two. Followed by Suzuha, Luka, and Mayuri. Kurisu #8217;s ending completely destroyed me. For some reason it felt like the bad ending. If she would have been just a couple seconds faster man....</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I just ordered the Suzuha one a bit ago. I got so lucky and managed to find a seller on eBay selling her for a decent price because the front wheel was broken. Hoping I can fix it. Used ones are out there. But lately the ones I #8217;ve seen so far are going for like $225-250 new from Japan. It #8217;s insane. If you can though, I #8217;d recommend saving up and getting the Kurisu bunny. The box is MASSIVE and she #8217;s easily the tallest figure I have. I think she #8217;s 16 inches (420mm) tall. Worth it in my opinion. I think there #8217;s also some used Goodsmile ones around going for $50-80 depending. I #8217;d check ebay and Myfigurecollection. Could get lucky!</TEXT>

The Slappy puppet one, and the worms one. Edit: Now looking at the covers of them all on wiki, I read a lot more of them than I remembered. I did read the GYGB ones though! The Wax Museum one stuck with me for some reason.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I've been wondering what the artists based her mountain bike off of. The closest thing I was able to find is the [Bianchi Magma](https://www.bianchi.com/bike/magma-9s-sx-eagle-1x12sp/) which looks very similar. It looks like her bike in the VN also has Maxxis inspired tires too. Pretty interesting how well thought out it was. Edit: I also just realized there is a "Gary Fisher" saddle too.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I feel like it happens most of all when watching art youtubers. I'll look at the supplies they're using and think to myself "hey! i need that!" Even though the supplies I have are perfectly fine and could do the job just as well. I suppose on a related note, the "I need this to draw that" or "If only I had this tool I could draw/paint like him/her" This is one that cost me the most especially when I was first drawing. Id see artists with beautiful works done with Faber Castell pencils or Prismacolor markers, and think to myself "I need that!" When I bought them I realized that just because I had them, didn't mean I had built up the skill to use them that way yet. Then I'd see people making art with #2 pencils and Crayola supplies and realize all the money Id wasted. lol...</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Yeah I didn #8217;t get that either. I liked her original look... although I may be biased since I have the exact same hair color as her in the VN (ginger guy lol). Im sure some like her anime hair, but to me her VN hair just looks way better and more natural than the anime hair. Maybe it was just easier and less time consuming to design her the way they did? Who knows.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Its something that I've been wondering. For all the review videos on anime and manga they do, do they actually watch everything? It's gotta be extremely hard to keep up with everything that comes out. Also, how the hell do they remember plots and characters from all the anime they've seen before? Maybe its editing? Do they do research beforehand? With all the anime they watch and manga they read to keep up with their audience, I have no idea how they have lives outside of anime lol.</TEXT>

    <DATE>2020-08-29 08:10:31</DATE>
    <TEXT>Specs: Ryzen 5 1600AF, MSI b450i Gaming Plus AC (BIOS Ver. 7A40vAA 9/25/19), EVGA GeForce RTX 2070 SUPER XC GAMING (B-stock), Corsair Vengeance LPX 16GB (2x8GB) DDR4 DRAM 3200MHz C16, EVGA SuperNOVA 650 G1, 80+ GOLD 650W, Silverstone SG13. I upgraded from an older 970 that I used as a placeholder until the 2070s arrived. After I installed it and did a clean install with the latest drivers, I started playing RE2 and the card ramped up the fan speed and had very loud coil whine. After about 5 minutes the game constantly kept freezing up and giving a fatal error. I tried another game, same problem, always freezes or gives an error. I'm always able to just ALT-TAB my way out and force quit the game though. I tried adjusting the fans and adjusting the voltage/clock speed in Afterburner and Precision but it still has the same problem along with constant fan use and coil noise if the card is even remotely used now. I've emailed EVGA support, but was wondering if there's something I can try in the meantime?</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I #8217;m about an hour into You and Me and Her, and I love Aoi #8217;s spacing out personality. It #8217;s great because I absolutely loved Mashiro Shiina in the Pet Girl of Sakurasou anime and Erio in Ground Control to Psychoelectric Girl. Any VNs with characters you know of that are similar?</TEXT>

    <TITLE>Do you prefer to finish a VN before starting a new one? Or do you play multiple ones at the same time?</TITLE>
    <DATE>2020-09-05 19:36:26</DATE>
    <TEXT>I get that some people can have multiple stories going at the same time. But for me I think it would just get confusing and not as engrossing. Trying to remember the plot and the characters for a bunch of them at once. Maybe playing a few at once would help with the post VN depression though..</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Do you know of any VNs with more female characters that are kind of elegant and refined? Similar to [Lilly](https://vndb.org/c764?view=0S-xg7Bmz6h) from Katawa Shoujo, and [Yui](https://vndb.org/c65111?view=0S-xg7Bmz6h) from IxSHE Tell.

    <TEXT>I have a bottle of L'Homme YSL that a pretty much never wear because it gives me such a bad headache. It's not just that one though. I tried a sample of Spicebomb and had the same reaction. Its that same with anything that's heavy on the citrus too. I was gifted a bottle of Versace Pour Homme and cant stand it after more than a few minutes. Interestingly I got a sample of Bleu de Chanel Parfum and I'm completely fine. I'm kind of at a loss on what to wear when the weather gets colder. Maybe I should try something woodsy or leathery?</TEXT>

    <TEXT>It's pretty good. The background art for most scenes is beautiful. It tends to take itself not too seriously, and it has a ton of comedic dialogue and sound effects tossed in. The characters all are really likable and funny, even the generic classmate ones. The MC's sister Aoba in particular is hilarious and she never fails to make dirty jokes or try to embarrass the MC or the girl he (you) picks. Each of the girls have three H scenes if I remember right. I got the uncensored version from JAST US, so idk how different the Steam version is.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Crazy is the best way to describe it. MC gets accused of serial murder and ends up getting sent to a prison school for murderers where he is considered the top serial killer there with the highest kill count. Everyone wants to kill him either out of jealousy, or love. If you #8217;ve ever seen Prison School, Deadman Wonderland, or Evil or Live, it #8217;s along those same lines. All of the characters are very well done though. They all have a reason for being there, and the author went out of his way to make a backstory for everyone. The way the author describes their looks, and their personality traits makes them very believable. The translation is great, but I did notice a couple typos here and there. Renko, the girl on the front cover on 1 is hilarious and is best girl imo so far. Her personality at the point I #8217;m at is best described as  #8220;air headed yandere #8221; although sometimes she #8217;ll bust out some random intelligent lines or intentionally say something to a character to rile them up. It would be sweet if this got an anime or VN. Just to see the characters voiced and come to life would be amazing.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Do you have an electric or acoustic? I #8217;ve got a cheap Ltd electric that I #8217;ve been practicing on, but no amp. I have no idea what #8217;s good. I was thinking about getting one of those audio controllers that you can plug the guitar into and run the amp simulators on the computer. Those look pretty sweet.</TEXT>

I might be getting ahead of myself here. Still learning basic tuning and memorizing the fret board and chords lol.</TEXT>

It all seems so confusing though. All the terminology. Major and minor chords, the fret board changes if you change the tuning apparently? Man... Edit: Curious about what you said about writing music too. Did you learn traditional sheet music? How is it different than writing with tabs?</TEXT>

    <TITLE>Manga vs Manhwa. Which do you prefer?</TITLE>
    <DATE>2020-10-15 23:45:59</DATE>
    <TEXT>Ive only been reading manga for about a year. But in that year I #8217;ve grown used to the right to left reading format and having most of the images contained to one page. When I first found manhwa I initially didn #8217;t like it. The format was weird and I didn #8217;t like scrolling through a ton of white space to get to the next image. HOWEVER, after reading a few I #8217;ve grown to like it. First, they #8217;re mostly in color. Which is a nice change from most manga that usually only have a few colored pages. I don #8217;t know what it is about Korean manhwa authors, but holy hell they love their fashion. Every single character I #8217;ve come across is dressed to the 9 #8217;s. Even when they #8217;re in lounge wear everything is perfect and coordinated. Particularly for the female characters. I #8217;ve noticed that the scrolling that I didn #8217;t like can actually lead to some really amazing transitions. Almost like a panning shot in a movie. I suppose one downside....maybe it #8217;s just the genres I read. But there #8217;s a crap ton of cheating between characters. Idk if it #8217;s just to add drama or they #8217;re trying to make things interesting. But it #8217;s kinda disheartening to see a couple start to get together, then suddenly a random model guy pops up and steals the MCs girl. Anyway. Just thought I #8217;d share. I #8217;ll continue to check out more manhwas. I #8217;m starting to like them.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Nagatoro would give poor Sumi a panic attack. Although it would be interesting to see her roast Mami alive and bully Kazuya and Mizuhara. I think her and Yaemori would get along though.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Yup! I noticed that! They use tons of references. There #8217;s another mangaka that does a manga about French royalty I think? And he takes a ton of pictures and references material from the period. I #8217;ll see if I can find the video. Edit: [Here. His art is amazing](https://youtu.be/TDpn9fdsRbY)</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I think it #8217;s just the way she #8217;s drawn and her facial expressions. I haven #8217;t read that many manga yet, but Nagatoro is one of the best I #8217;ve seen so far when it comes to expressions. Her face is just too great! I have no idea how long Nanashi has been drawing for, but his art and the way he uses shading in particular is amazing. It really works for Nagatoro and makes her face cute, or menacing, depending on the scene. So I #8217;d say it #8217;s mostly the art, and her personality that shows through from it.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Eh a lot of the time it #8217;s just something to do to pass the time. But it #8217;s also recommended just for the practice and learning. Nothing wrong with redrawing an image as long as you #8217;re not making money off of it, or claiming it to be your own original character. A lot of artists on the other subreddits actually recommend redrawing images you like. It helps to deconstruct them. You get to figure out what makes them work, and you get to see why the artist did certain things like the perspective of the pose or the way they did shading.</TEXT>
