    <TEXT>(Note: before people start downvoting, I am not saying anyone on here with actually-abusive parents is faking it) I'm just wondering if anyone else, whenever they get upset to the point of "having a tantrum", has this really negative self-talk that they "mentally turn into" verbal abuse they picture to be coming from their parents, especially if it's really fantastical stuff like mine (y'know, things like "You can't come out of your room until [unlikely-event-to-even-happen-in-the-present-never-mind-have-happened that would somehow nullify what I was sent to my room for] has happened in the past and if it had you wouldn't have been sent to your room in the first place so guess you're stuck there forever now" or, when my mom talked about leaving me somewhere for a couple of hours if I didn't shut up, (me imagining her saying) "I would tell you to take bunches of breadcrumbs to help find your way home but that would mean you'd find an evil witch's gingerbread house and you don't deserve to be even an unfortunate "redshirt" casualty of a story like that never mind the protagonist who defeats the witch")</TEXT>

    <TITLE>If we have a world war 3 that isn't nuclear and such a scientific breakthrough would be possible, create a real-life super soldier serum to create a real Captain America</TITLE>
    <DATE>2019-01-24 00:20:39</DATE>
    <TEXT>Sure, some things would be different e.g. this Cap wouldn't have to be white, blond and blue-eyed to subvert the Nazi ideals by showing someone who looked like their "master race" fighting against them because we probably wouldn't be fighting Nazis but that doesn't mean they'd have to be some ridiculous combination of minorities for "diversity's sake", there'd probably have to be qualification tests (even if only one could be Captain America and we didn't have a bunch of super-soldiers like in Overwatch) and they'd take the most qualified person no matter their minority statuses. Also, they'd no more have to become a "Capsicle" for 70 years than they'd have to fall in tragically-doomed-by-said-accident love with a Peggy-Carter-esque secret agent who later founds a SHIELD-like organization. We're not that universe, we can be as "Elseworlds" with our heroes as we want, but this still might inspire even more people to take up real-life superheroic careers whether or not it's an identity originally from the Marvel universe Also, for those questioning how if we were to become a "parallel Marvel universe" the MCU could still exist/have existed, may I direct your attention to silver-age Flash comics. In them, Barry read (or at least read as a kid) comics about the Jay Garrick incarnation of The Flash before he found out he was a real person from a different world and that's probably where he got the name/imagery of his Flash identity from.</TEXT>

    <TITLE>A Sonic The Hedgehog Broadway musical</TITLE>
    <DATE>2019-01-26 07:54:23</DATE>
    <TEXT>This is still a crazy idea but it's less crazy than it might seem at first because e.g. the cartoon succeeded proving that universe can make it on story alone and there are already songs with lyrics on the soundtracks of several games (you might have heard some of them in Smash, like Escape From The City or Reach For The Stars) that could be used as models for the "sound" of the show's music (or at least the up-tempo numbers, there would be ballads too) As for the look of the characters, my vision for this show would look like what they did for the Spongebob musical, where other than a few key animal parts (like, in Sonic's case, Tails's tails or certain other characters' ears or Rouge's wings), the animal characters would look basically like human versions of themselves wearing clothing either that they wear in canon (for the characters who wear clothes) or that is evocative of their character's look/physicality (e.g. in the Spongebob musical, Patrick still wears those iconic bottoms or at least something like them but he isn't shirtless the whole show) instead of looking like furries/making the show look too "theme park" One main problem other than gaining character rights or whatever is what to do about Tails; a character so young/small should be cast with at least a really young actor if not an actual kid, but the kind of harness stuff that would need to be done to mimic Tails's tail-flying would be rather riskier than usual with a kid, we don't need another Turn Off The Dark</TEXT>

    <TEXT>E.g. with the immortality thing, many people have called the age gap between the two leads of Twilight problematic because of how old Edward is since he is a vampire but the problem is if he can't date people who are the age he looks like who is he supposed to date because, if I remember his age right, half-your-age-plus-7 puts him at potentially being only "allowed" to date people in their 50s and 60s on up while looking like he's 17 (and still being problematic). Also, if someone can shapeshift and take forms who physically look like they're different ages, what would that do to the power dynamics of their relationships?</TEXT>

    <TITLE>The creators of the cartoon Miraculous Ladybug should make an Overwatch-esque fighting game with the characters</TITLE>
    <DATE>2019-02-06 10:40:44</DATE>
    <TEXT>I got the idea when I was trying to think up abilities for an OC hero for Miraculous Ladybug and realized I was thinking about them in Overwatch terms. Then I realized that, from the Villains-Of-The-Week to the Miraculous users no matter their alignment, pretty much all the characters could work in this kind of environment (exceptions being Hawkmoth and a couple of the akumatized villains-of-the-week). It'd be a great way to get kids into fighting games and since the show is already going, it wouldn't have Overwatch's problem with the connect-the-dots lore (and if Overwatch can have people on different sides on the same team without the lore/immersion breaking, this game could have the previously-akumatized Miraculous wielders fighting against (or even alongside if it is team-based) the akumatized versions of themselves). The only downsides I see is because the outfits of the characters in their hero (or villain) forms are so iconic, there's really not a lot of skin opportunities (at least not for non-holiday ones) and also it couldn't add new "heroes" to the roster without either them having been mentioned on the show first or soon after</TEXT>

    <TEXT>(Warning this is kinda unethical but note the sub) First you discover immortality and give it to everyone but them but don't tell them. Then you make sure they all get into accidents serious enough to knock them out and while they're knocked out give them the immortality pill/shot/whatever and transport them to a nice neighborhood full of houses and shops etc. that you'd previously built in the middle of nowhere (how many there'd be would depend on the scale of this project). When they come to, tell them they're in Heaven but it just doesn't look like a bunch of fluffy clouds or whatever and haven't they ever seen The Good Place (although that would get the Christian fans suspecting they might actually be in the Bad Place, there would be no other allusions to that fake Good Place from S1/2 e.g. no soulmate-pairing-by-default (or at least not when it splits families), no frozen yogurt shops, no "censor mind filter" or whatever the fork that was, not people from all over the world etc). Only let them rejoin a hopefully-much-better-off (but not by their absence) real world once everyone has either figured out the mystery of *this* fake "Good Place" themselves or been convinced by someone who had using logical reasoned arguments, and compliment them on their improved critical thinking skills on the way out TL;DR get Christian fundies to accept being biologically immortal if it's possible by making them immortal and trapping them in the good kind (as in not actually the Bad Place) of fake "Good Place" and keep tabs on how long it takes them to reason their way to the truth (which will quite literally set them free)</TEXT>

What I mean by that is things like when the subtitles of a movie, show or game show the "stage directions" (things like *giggles*, *loud noise*, *soft music plays* etc.), or those "Every episode of [TV show]" or "Every song by [band]" memes with really stereotypical/cliche lyrics or dialogue (the latter of which sometimes has the only point where I hate the stage direction thingie written down), or even descriptions of how long something happens for (like the instructions to an old childhood toy of mine saying "Lights flash for about 10 seconds"). At one point I even managed to do this to myself when mom and I were having an argument about whether or not Pokemon Go was a fad and I said that I felt like the way she perceived it, it might as well have turned on and then turned off forever after everybody ooed and ahed for a few seconds, and then I promptly proceeded to run off in a veil of tears</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Need to know because I'm at an impasse with typing a lot of fictional characters when they end up showing equal signs of two types that are both in the same triad so can't be both part of their tritype (e.g. two different villains from a similar villain archetype are both either a 1w2 or 8w9 in my mind and I don't know which)</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I want to adapt this series for TV if I can get the rights but I want to have a good idea of what their types are based on the books so that, if I end up having to change plot points for various reasons, the characters would still be in character Only character I can give the core type of off the top of my head is Aja, who's a very very blatant 5w4. Closest I can come for other characters is that Saint Dane's tritype is probably 358 in some order (types w/wings being 3w4, 5w4 and 8w9 though I'm not sure what his core is), Spader seems like a 7, Bobby has a 1 and/or 6 in his tritype, and Mark's most likely a head triad dominant (5, 6 or 7 although just because he's a smarty-pants outcast doesn't mean he's a 5 automatically)</TEXT>

    <TITLE>[God Friended Me] A Doylist explanation not predicting the identity of the God account but explaining the nature of the mystery</TITLE>
    <DATE>2019-03-04 05:11:17</DATE>
    <TEXT>So, if anyone else watched this most recent God Friended Me, the ending implied that the God account was the trial of Simon's secret project that Rakesh would now be working on with him. However, I don't think that, unless the series was ending after this season, they'd wrap things up that tightly in that much of an unexpected way because unless there's either a moral (about each of us having God inside of them or whatever, but that might probably be too expected to be the core message of the show) or the mother of all twists (Simon Hayes actually being a human avatar of God or whatever or at least one of his messengers and the God account being how he does "God's work" on Earth) it loses the so-prominent spiritual element of the premise. Instead, I think what is going to occur is similar to what happened with Leverage and Sophie's real first name (look it up), just like there've already been, every season the show goes on is going to have a "red herring" God account theory that could potentially be true to both heighten the mystery/myth arc and provide a satisfying explanation to the core mystery should the show "die before its time", whereas the true natural ending of the show would lean things in the more spiritual direction it has been leaning all along but be a lot less obvious in its (no pun intended) revelation</TEXT>

    <TITLE>[MTG] Although they will greatly impact the MtG multiverse, any Major Character Death in the upcoming expansion won't last forever</TITLE>
    <DATE>2019-03-06 06:07:41</DATE>
    <TEXT>So as time has gone on, I've been getting more and more afraid we'd lose a main character in the upcoming expansion (especially because of the description of the upcoming comic's summary) but I've also developed a few explanations as to why the loss probably won't be a permanent loss. The Watsonian explanation is that if it's a member of the Gatewatch, the rest of the team would basically move heaven and multiverse to get them back as much to life as possible (as in no, just mere necromancy doesn't count) and a couple Doylist explanations are A. the "main character Planeswalkers" are some of the biggest card-sellers/merchandise-movers in the game and if they kill off someone like that forever (and not just an only-important-for-one-block Planeswalker like Elspeth though she did kinda sorta come back) they lose all the money they could make from stuff with them on it and also they'd royally piss off the fandom and B. given the nature and name of said expansion and comparisons they've made before between the Gatewatch and the Avengers, methinks they're trying to replicate the success of Infinity War by having their own version and since it's looking more and more likely if not guaranteed that the Snap gets reversed in Endgame, it's fair to assume that (even if it's one-to-a-handful-of-deaths and not half the multiverse or even half the Planeswalkers) their "Snap" will get undone as well</TEXT>

    <DATE>2019-03-06 08:36:39</DATE>
    <TEXT>Here's some of my ideas (assuming same event schedule kept) Sorted by event Halloween * Creepy Doll D.va (I saw a skin that had her as Chucky but this would be more like a china doll sort of thing with a similar aesthetic to Melanie Martinez in her music videos) * Little Red Riding Hood D.va with a wolf mech * Angel/Devil Moira (like that classic sort of costume you see at Halloween stores with a half-halo and angel outfit on one side and a horn and devil outfit on the other though this would be less sexy and more fitting with her "fantasy RPG sci-fied up" aesthetic) * Genie Sombra * Alchemist Baptiste (based off of D amp;D Alchemists and would aesthetically look somewhat similar to skins like Van Helsing McCree and Demon Hunter Sombra) Winter Wonderland * Santa D.va * if Blizzard ever confirms my headcanon of her being Jewish I had a great idea for a Hanukkah skin for Mercy, her in a Hanukkah-print dress with a tallis over it and a kippah (ideally with the Overwatch logo on it) over her let-down hair, her wings would look like a lit menorah at least somewhat and (since I could find nothing explicitly Hanukkah-y to make it so I had to go with something Jewish in general) her staff would be a yod, the pointer people use to mark their place in the Torah with as they read as you can #8217;t actually touch the scroll with your hand * Santa Lucia Brigitte (an epic, her all in white with the candle crown and maybe a few other festive details here and there on her outfit) * Gingerbread Girl Tracer (I know most people want a D.va one and there #8217;s no reason she couldn #8217;t get one later, but come on,  #8220;run run just as fast as you can, you can #8217;t catch me I #8217;m the gingerbread man #8221;) * Reindeer/Rudolph Orisa Summer Games * We #8217;ve seen the spray and some of his voice lines, now where #8217;s the Wrecking Ball Bowling Ball skin with Hammond himself in like a little neon bowling shirt with his name on it * Demigod D.va (Meant as an Ancient-Greek-inspired skin like Winged Victory Mercy but this one more obviously hero/warrior-esque, the mech would either be all white and incorporate Greek architectural elements into its design (column legs etc.) or look bronze as a reference to Talos, the giant bronze robot from Greek myth) Lunar New Year * One of my ideas for a yearly costume  #8220;theme #8221; for this event (like how 2017 #8217;s was Journey To The West, 2018 #8217;s was the four directional animals and 2019 #8217;s is very clearly Romance Of The Three Kingdoms), is ancient Chinese deities, deity would be matched with character through a combination of matching visual styles and how well the hero #8217;s lore/motifs match up with the myths and symbolism surrounding the god(dess) Anniversary/Miscellaneous * Prep School Tracer * Cheerleader Tracer * Punk D.va * Emo Lucio * Wild West D.va (definitely stagecoach mech, not sure if she herself would have a cowboy outfit or a saloon girl outfit, either would work) * Magical girl anime related skins for as many heroes as it #8217;d work for; magical girl skins for the good guys (both girls and any guys that could still work on) and Dark Magical Girl skins for the female bad guys (because nearly every magical girl anime, from Sailor Moon to Winx Club and beyond, has the heroes take on some kind of evil magical girl team) etc. * Florence Nightingale Mercy *Angel Pharah Charity skins * Red Symmetra (money going to someplace like ASAN) * Pride flag skins for Soldier and Tracer (and any more revealed-to-be-queer heroes down the line) Broadway (a weird idea I had for a  #8220;themed skindump #8221; like the Blizzard World one) * Phantom of The Opera Reaper * Macavity Junkrat (from Cats) * Revolutionary Lucio (inspired by Hamilton from Hamilton) * Peter Pan Tracer * Some sort of Heathers-inspired Widowmaker skin (not sure whether she #8217;d fit Veronica Sawyer or Heather Chandler better but it #8217;s the same general look just color-swapped, dunno what they #8217;d do to the gun though unless there was some way to make it reasonably look like a croquet mallet) * A pair of skins based on the lead women of Wicked; Mercy would be Glinda and I don #8217;t know who should be Elphaba, Moira would make sense lore-wise but Symmetra #8217;s design would be easier to adapt * Greaser/ #8221;T-Bird #8221; Zarya</TEXT>

    <DATE>2019-03-10 05:36:36</DATE>
    <TEXT>This isn't just wishful thinking based on the names and the setting but (if you discount gens 1 and 2 because Pokemon was originally meant to end after 2 but they kept it going) I have noticed some parallels between certain games especially in their villains e.g. R/S and XY both have an ecologically-minded-and-they-don't-care-who-gets-hurt snooty science-y team who wear a lot of red (and have a red-haired boss) and use a lot of Fire types (even though Team Magma is technically a Ground-Type Team) and there's also the link with ORAS meaning they both have Mega Evolution, DPPt and SuMo both have teams with weird "sci-fi" aesthetics (just look at the Aether Foundation's outfits), stories involving said teams unleashing Pokemon from other dimensions, and they even both feature appearances of some of the same characters like Looker. If the main gen games for 3 and 6 are similar and 4 and 7 are similar it is safe to assume the parallel might hold true for 5 and 8 and Sword and Shield might have a lot of superficial-to-the-same-level similarities to B1W1 (but that doesn't mean we're going to get SW2SH2 with similar changes). As for if 9 will parallel 3 and 6, I think there's only so far they could take those things and it instead will start another cycle of 6</TEXT>

    <DATE>2019-03-22 05:12:12</DATE>
    <TEXT>90% of the episodes this season so far (the major exceptions being "Home" and the 2-parter but that's perhaps due to the "myth arc tentpole" status of them) have had either characters singing and/or just a song playing a pivotal role and I can't help but hope this means that future seasons happening mean a full-on musical episode will be happening. Ideally it'd be like a cross between the Buffy musical episode (because I like how that one managed to tell a story while still giving every major character at that time at least half a song to themselves with no one's inclusion feeling forced) and the Psych musical episode (because I like how in that one, although some numbers exist diegetically for various reasons, for the rest of them there's no real explanation or "whammy" for why they're all breaking into song so they don't need to waste a song on questioning why everybody's singing)</TEXT>

Yes, this show would be yet another Star-Trek-but-different-with-the-serial-numbers-filed-off show like The Orville but it wouldn't feel as much like either because focusing on the kids would give it a fresh perspective. Kids could like seeing kids just like them having adventures and parents would appreciate a "spiritual successor" helping get kids into shows like Star Trek (a more unique kind of Lower Decks Show)</TEXT>

    <TEXT>So I saw a post about how while it's great that there's a lot of queer representation in children's cartoons (especially sci-fi/fantasy ones), it's a pain in the butt that it's mostly lesbians and bi women. Going off of this, I want to make some kind of sci-fi or fantasy cartoon geared towards guys (of the same age demographic as the people who watch the afore-alluded-to shows with wlw on them like Steven Universe or The Legend Of Korra) with male leads who eventually form a romantic relationship with each other. However, since I don't want the plot to revolve around their relationship (hence its genre) and I find it hard to write guys, I can't think of plot hooks that haven't been done before</TEXT>

    <TITLE>Inspired by the success of spongebob squarepants, I had two ideas for other cartoons with nonhuman characters that'd make great musicals</TITLE>
    <DATE>2019-04-02 03:09:53</DATE>
    <TEXT>Like with Spongebob, the non-human characters in both would be represented by humans in clothing-evocative-of-character with appropriate animal bits if necessary for recognizability (wings, ears, tail etc.). Also, the only other similarity would be that I think creating an original story to tell on the stage with these familiar characters would be better than trying to choose an installment to adapt. Anyway, with that out of the way here's my two ideas. 1. Sonic I've already written about this idea on here but in case you don't want to look up those posts, I think this could actually work. The cartoon proves the stories can stand on their own and the music would kinda sound like the actual with-lyrics songs from the Sonic games like Reach For The Stars or Escape From The City (at least the up-tempo numbers would, though the ballads would still share that same pop-punk sensibility). The only problems I see other than the obvious rights issue are A. how to weave an original story that includes most of the major players from the series both heroic and villainous without either making audience's heads spin or anyone's inclusion feel shoved-in-there and B. Tails; since his "thing" other than smarts is that he can fly his actor would be spending a lot of time in a harness but given his implied age relative to the rest of the heroes, you'd have to at least cast a teenager if not a preteen and are we sure we'd want someone that young doing something that dangerous 2. My Little Pony: Friendship Is Magic Once you use Equestria Girls as an excuse to have the ponies portrayed by humans with pony ears and tails (and wings and/or horns as appropriate), I don't see what's wrong with this idea. The songs (if they follow the style of those on the show) would be gorgeous, it'd be a mostly female ensemble cast with a lot of room for raceblind casting (because would it matter the ethnicity of the actresses when the ponies are purple, blue, yellow etc. in canon) and if Cursed Child can pull off all its special effects, this could make the sort of magic shown happen on the stage. So who else would want either Sonic The Hedgehog and/or My Little Pony: Friendship Is Magic to gain original musical installments?</TEXT>

    <TITLE>If indeed we get a 3rd season, what would you most want to see in it?</TITLE>
    <DATE>2019-04-14 03:54:53</DATE>
    <TEXT>Just making this to kinda diffuse a lot of the renewal debate because I see people doing stuff like making claims without any evidence like that the reason Seth named the show and therefore ship what he did was supposedly that he knew it'd be short-lived just like the Wright Brothers's first flight, which I find hard to believe (it just doesn't seem like him, it seems far more likely that if the "end of the show is engineered" like that, it's engineered to not really be the end and to come at a point where fan petitions can save it just like original Star Trek) Anyway, some things I'd want to see in a *crosses fingers* 3rd season are * Keep the Moclans (or at least the ones other than Bortus and his family) down to a dull roar please, because seriously this season had a bit too much * a musical episode with original songs (they have the perfect setup with how much music there's been this season "foreshadowing" a potential one, I just hope they don't take the easy way out with everybody getting "whammied" into singing by some space anomaly and having to waste a song on wondering why they're singing) * More Clisaac * LaMarr to get some freaking time in the spotlight * A "simulator malfunction episode" * Talla (assuming she sticks around, I heard a rumor around the time Alara left that Alara might come back in S3) to get not only at least one character development episode but also maybe a recurring love interest (it wouldn't have to be bridge crew) who I'd ideally want to be female (because if anyone in the main ensemble was going to be queer other than Bortus being gay-by-technicality, I think it'd make a lot of sense for her to be gay or bi (and no, not just because she's so much of a "tomboy")) * Some mention of humans still having religion in this future time unless Seth is completely against that idea but still willing to make the Krill analogues for right-wing bible-thumpers to some degree (I who have watched a lot of atheists and creationists debate on YouTube recognize some arguments I saw them use in favor of Avis) which furthers the parallel to Star Trek proper because the Klingons were almost always written as stand-ins for "whoever the show's target audience of Americans hates today"</TEXT>

    <TITLE>Not sure if teens could relate to an adult protag (have a novel idea I'm not sure if should be YA or not)?</TITLE>
    <DATE>2019-04-15 09:06:24</DATE>
    <TEXT>The protagonist isn't just an adult but a mother and the story kicks off with her searching for her missing daughter and eventually stumbling on some kind of portal-fantasy portal-thingie (like Alice's rabbit hole or the Pevensies' wardrobe) that all signs point to the daughter having gone in. She goes in after her and ends up having her own little magical quest in there as she searches for her daughter and rediscovering her sense of childlike wonder and all that crap and they do end up finding each other and teaming up in the end Mom thinks teens wouldn't be able to relate to an adult protag who's a mother because most teens haven't had kids but that's not what I'd be intending a hypothetical teen audience to relate to. If the intended readers had read the kind of portal fantasy this is homaging, they're no doubt familiar with protags having to keep their discovery secret from skeptic parents if they make multiple visits and/or worlds having some sort of rule where you "grow up out of them". However, by showing an adult having that sort of adventure in a "childish" world and teaming up with her kid at the end, I'd be showing them they don't have to stop believing and "grow too old for Neverland" or whatever (if I get them while they're starting to "grow up" with this message about the importance of holding onto their innocence, they hopefully won't have to learn to "re-believe in magic" like adults might)</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Since Disney's been on quite the remake streak lately and Hunchback was a popular enough movie at its time to warrant a sequel (whatever you might say about the quality of the sequel), a remake would seem like a good idea anyway (they could maybe add in some of the songs the Broadway show added wherever they might fit to make it different) and this just makes it sadly timely. It's not only timely but it's true to "authorial intent" as the book The Hunchback Of Notre Dame was written for iirc a similar purpose</TEXT>

    <DATE>2019-04-17 05:20:42</DATE>
    <TEXT>Yeah, I get it, it was a bit of a letdown, but the way the people on this sub are reacting, you'd think that what they promised before delivering this was Overwatch for VR and an event gamemode that was literally (though with usual gameplay mechanics "built into the story" like the previous events these sort of fans extoll) an hour-and-a-half plus movie where you could play as any of a sizable list of characters (both good guys and the "villain heroes") and get an almost completely different gameplay experience depending on who you picked (and that the fact that it ended up being what it was is proof everyone who works on that sort of thing for the game are a bunch of money-hungry dipshits who should all be fired (someone even cynically said something like "bet there's going to be a lot of LEGOs and Nerf weapons based on this "event'"")). Maybe it's just me half-being-curious-for-more-because-cliffhanger (which I would have been regardless of mission length) and half-being-optimistic but I can't help but feel like there's more coming (and that they just couldn't have called it something like Storm Rising Pt. 1 without giving that away). I know people seemingly like to use the event's tagline of "Chase The Truth" as a bit of a pejorative against Blizzard once they found out what this event was like but I sorta-kinda wonder if maybe this is either the signal of them starting to move towards more long-form storytelling proper with their lore (and maybe even towards something like that TV cartoon "spinoff" I've been wanting, though I get the feeling if we got a cartoon to help coalesce the lore, these kind of fans would still throw a tantrum if it had more of a gap between episodes than the week you'd expect from a non-PBSKids cartoon) and/or another ARG. Y'know, what if, just like the heroes we played as, they're (in a good way) making us chase the truth? But anyway, no matter what happens in the future with either this event or Archives in general never mind the game in general, I ask one thing of you the fans. PLEASE FUCKING TAKE A CHILL PILL! It's not just regarding this event (I wouldn't mind the criticism so much if it didn't seem like it was every other post on this sub and if there weren't people judging the entirety of the game by one event/"coincidentally" remembering everything bad they'd said about it previously and/or literally naming names of people who should be fired) but there are other things it seems like the game can't catch a break on with at least the fans on here. E.g. people complaining about other event gamemodes being the same every year, or people complaining so much when healers are played like DPSs (which according to them means not constantly healing someone all the damn time) that if I was one of the people working on lore/character creation (and if I was I'd have added more to Storm Rising but y'all probably still would have complained) I'd have half a mind to make next April's April Fools Day joke a fake "leak" of whatever's the next character-seen-in-lore-whose-addition-to-the-roster-is-highly-anticpated (like Doomfist or Hammond, and like arguably Echo, Sojourn, the Junker Queen and (once she's "old enough") Efi are now) as a healer who can literally do no damage whatsofuckingever, or people thinking any new piece of lore that adds more detail contradicts previously established facts when most of what it's contradicting if anything is fanon (like all the people raging about D.va's short and some people even denying its connection to the game calling it, like, "a trailer for Korean!Pacific Rim", just because it gives her more depth than just being their "meme-worthy Dorito gremlin" or "hot gamergurl waifu"), or people *still* having apoplectic fits over Brigitte being on the roster so much so that I'm not sure if I should play her or if she's really so toxicbroken, or people saying they're going to uninstall the game every time they're disappointed in it when I highly doubt they've uninstalled and reinstalled *every* time they found a disappointing thing etc. etc. TL;DR it isn't asking for cultish devotion or whatever to say that maybe Overwatch (by that I mean the team behind it) would show you more appreciation if you showed the game more appreciation for the good things it does provide. Criticism is fine, picking apart every damn thing they do and acting like whatever's the closest you can find to a bad thing is what's going to "ruin the game forever if it hasn't already killed it", not so fine.</TEXT>

And another thing those kinds of genre shows have taught me is when the plot of an episode like this seems specifically designed to split a couple like is probably going to happen, they're going to find each other again and their love get even stronger (and somehow love would be the way to set things right though I doubt The Orville would, even if they had some technobabble explanation, have Ed and Kelly literally True Love's Kiss time back on track)</TEXT>

    <TEXT>For example, here are some quotes from the three leads of a movie I #8217;m working on. - Judson  #8220;That #8217;s not why I want to be president. I want to be president so I can bring peace to the world, rescue the environment, and throw out the first ball at baseball games! Adios, amoebas! #8221;  #8220;I thought a person #8217;s image was the natural personality they give off #8221;  #8220;We #8217;re a perfect team. I #8217;m young and she #8217;s old. I #8217;m dumb and she #8217;s smart. I keep her head in the clouds and she keeps my feet on the ground. #8221;  #8220;But what if I don #8217;t like either of those parties, why can #8217;t I just run as me? #8221;  #8220;You think Abby #8217;s ugly? Remember all of her good qualities I told you. Didn #8217;t our parents always teach us it #8217;s what #8217;s inside that counts? Also, Abby #8217;s been my best friend since preschool, show her some respect. #8221; - Lane  #8220;You know, politicians aren #8217;t picked by a bunch of political cronies in smoke-filled rooms anymore. It #8217;s all computers, social media, image-makers and advertising now. They might as well be selling soap. It #8217;s a game anyone can play if you know the rules and I #8217;d like to think I do. #8221;  #8220;It #8217;s just a symbol. Grown-ups get all misty-eyed when they see lemonade stands. It reminds them of the good old days. #8221;  #8220;The President of the United States is sort of like the king of the hill. I guess if I could get you elected it #8217;d be sort of like I was king of the hill too #8221;  #8220;That means I tell you what to do, what to wear, what to say, and when to say it. And you #8217;ve got to run to win. I don #8217;t want to get started with this thing unless you #8217;re willing to stick with me to the bitter end. So we #8217;re in agreement? #8221;  #8220;That #8217;s the girl. She may not be  #8220;school-smart #8221; but she #8217;s a lot more than the dumb blonde she comes off as. #8221; - June  #8220; Sixth grade! The perfect grade! When you #8217;re in sixth grade you know everything in the world there is to know. In fourth grade you know nothin #8217;. In fifth grade you know nothin #8217;. And suddenly you hit sixth grade and you know it *all*. Nobody can tell you nothin #8217;. Then a funny thing happens when you get older and become a grown-up. You don #8217;t know nothin #8217; again. #8221;  #8220;When anyone, whatever their gender, comes along who really wants to lead this country and not just play politics, then I #8217;ll pull the lever for  #8216;em.  #8216;Til then, I #8217;ll sit here on this porch and watch the world go down the toilet. #8221;  #8220;A boy your age shouldn #8217;t even have any serious questions yet. #8221;  #8220;Fun? Don #8217;t you know that being President is just about the worst job in the world? Everybody hates you no matter what you do. You can #8217;t go anywhere. They watch your every move. You say one wrong word or do one wrong thing and everybody jumps all over you. Then in four years they kick you out on your behind. Maybe eight. What do you need that for? #8221; "Politics changes a person. It rips your heart out and puts a stone in its place"</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I'm a TV writer trying to get something actually picked up so I thought an anthology show like this would be a good place to get my foot in the door. I even have a couple episode scripts already written and I'll give a sample synopsis of one including its working title (but not including any character names or the twist) to give you an idea of the kind of episodes to expect "Echo Chamber" - First contact happens for a surprising reason, the alien who makes contact (through picking up on Earth radio) is a huge fan of an Earth "pop princess" [who wouldn't be played by any existing pop star as I don't want to make a statement about their fandom] and wants to meet her in person. The first meeting goes well enough but then he starts showing up at a lot of her other concerts/events and then people begin to notice a mysterious epidemic of deafness following in his wake whose victims are quickly determined to be linked by their public criticism of the singer's music. It turns out the alien has deliberately been deafening non-fans with some advanced gadget because on his home planet as soon as you express dislike of something you're forbidden from being exposed to it anymore. [the twist is how the singer and some of her fans get revenge on this asshole alien exclusionist before the only hearing people left in America are she and her fans]</TEXT>

    <TITLE>[The Orville} (if we get more seasons) Claire and Isaac will get back together (assuming her remarks in 2x13 meant they actually broke up in the first place) and eventually get married</TITLE>
    <DATE>2019-05-06 00:25:24</DATE>
    <TEXT>No, this is not just because I ship the ship, I have actual justification. I noticed that despite what people think was the announcement of them having broken up occurring in "Tomorrow, And Tomorrow, And Tomorrow", their interactions seemed a little strained as far back as the end of "Identity Pt. 2" so I think the events of the two-parter and what it put both of them through might have been (if she did indeed break up) what eventually triggered her breaking up with him. I think part of her might be worried that their love can't happen as long as the rest of his race is a threat. I think that they might get back together somewhere around the next season once the up-close-and-personal fight against the other Kaylons is further from her mind and she's made enough positive memories with Isaac platonically to help rekindle what once was. Anyway, that's my little amateur-psychoanalysis attempt at a Watsonian reason why they'll get back together. Now here's some Doylist reasons why they'll get back together and get married. 1. With Ed/Kelly seeming likely to get resolved one way or the other in season 3, they'll need a new main romantic pairing to help drive the subplots, and since Bortus and Klyden (the only other couple among the main characters) are married albeit in an increasingly unstable marriage, unless another ship hits us out of nowhere rekindling Clisaac seems like their best bet (and also it'd still fit with where Isaac is in his arc of exploring his growing "humanity"). As for why they'll get married, not only were the four (Isaac, Claire and her kids) presented as a family before Isaac and Claire even became lovers (nice bit of potential foreshadowing), but I've noticed on the show how a lot of seemingly throwaway lines and scenes get some kind of big payoff later which is why I think there's going to be some kind of wedding on the ship (providing justification for that scene where they're discussing who officiates marriages between Union ship crewmembers) and as for why I think that (if they get back together) it's going to be Clisaac, look at my above point about the lack of other ships on the ship other than equally-semi-"off" Ed/Kelly and shakily-already-married Bortus/Klyden</TEXT>

    <TITLE>Is the supposed Flash shutdown next year actually going to permanently shut down anything requiring Flash forever? Is there any way to stop it from happening or any alternative to Flash makers of these games could switch to?</TITLE>
    <DATE>2019-05-06 23:54:39</DATE>
    <TEXT>Seeing people on Tumblr panic over the potential loss of Flash-based alternatives and I think they're kind of negatively overhyping what's going to be happening not just because it gives them the opportunity to meme things like "where should we meet then? the Roman forum? hobby lobby? an allyway behind a Denny's in tashkent?" (or other such meme-worthy "liminal aesthetic" random places) but because they've been wrong about internet-related tragedies before e.g. thinking the death of net neutrality would lead to everything from paying 75 cents every time you made a Tumblr post to a full-on cyberpunk dystopia that for all we know is an actual fictional one that is our universe in a mobius-nested simulation, or thinking that article 13 would mean career death for all European YouTubers when (though news has been so scattershot about it that I don't know if the thing actually passed or not or has yet to) I just watched a Jacksepticeye video earlier today. Also, knowing certain corners of both Tumblr and social media as a whole, a lot of people if I asked what I could do about this would say the only way to stop this decision on the corporate level without becoming corrupt is some kind of bloody revolution that involves beheading-via-guillotine and eating anyone over a certain income level and then hanging their skeletons from lampposts as warnings and then all somehow "magically" becoming gay communist robots living in space (literal interpretation of FAGSLC) TL;DR is Flash dying as much as the Internet would like me to believe it is, how can I stop it if there's a way, and is there an alternative Flash-game-makers can move their games to/remake them on?</TEXT>

My point by mentioning that not being an option is it's something I'm surprised a lot more people haven't thought of, just make sure the administration doesn't change, and I want more options than just that as who knows, whichever dictator we get if we deliberately try for one might decide to abandon the program once they use it to trick people into giving them unilateral power for the rest of their life</TEXT>

    <TEXT>The way people are talking about the connection between Trump and this mission (e.g. that it'll get scrubbed if he doesn't win or if it can't be finished by 2024) you'd think (though I'm not saying this is the case) that not only will it only happen if he wins a second term but transport him on Inauguration Day to a bigger better Trump White House (as that'd be its official name) on the moon As I said, I know that's unlikely, but I just want to know, (to state a more politicized version of what I said in the title) is it *that* tied to his election that we'd need to find a way if a Democrat won to keep it going without having to long-con the entire Republican party into thinking he got reelected?</TEXT>

Given that and given how popular a character D.va is, wouldn't it be a cool thing for them to do to make the game excelling at got her where she is now into a real thing (no I'm not saying they should work with either the Korean or American government to secretly develop a similar program, they'd at least be decades too early, but I'd still love to play the game)</TEXT>

    <TEXT>A. If they do this, it'd have to be one of the girls, as understandably Mr. Ratburn would have to be a big part of that story helping them through the process or whatever, and a gay male teacher helping a male student understand their sexuality would invite all sorts of unfortunate subtext (although if they do it right, it could work if it was a guy, they've dealt with more controversy-laden situations before) B. Because even of the students, Arthur's ensemble cast is so freaking big but pretty much everyone gets at least one spotlight episode, whoever would end up being gay would still get ample time for the show to explore that story while providing many episodes free of "homosexual content" for the right-wing to enjoy C. (Whatever their gender) the more gay kid characters we have on TV, the more people understand that gayness isn't inherently NSFW. And in terms of the romantic stuff, there have been episodes revolving around crushes and secret admirers etc. and even celebrity crushes (which if they involve whichever character would turn out to be queer and that character is gay not bi, could just be blamed on expectations set by compulsory heterosexuality)</TEXT>

Reuse a plot twist that hasn't been used since Gen 1 and make the evil team leader also a Gym Leader. It'd give more plot threads to tie the leaders to the story (and not just them) and if it seems too obvious if they're leading a Dark-type gym, maybe do one of two things; either they're not the only evil team and it's a SuMo-like situation and/or (to throw people off) the type the evil team specializes in isn't Dark but one of the dual types of the Pokemon on the Gym Leader's team (and they just have enough Pokemon to have two teams with just that little bit of overlap) e.g. if the team is a Steel-type-specialist evil team maybe the leader would have a Bisharp both when you fight them as a Gym Leader and as a "bad guy". Not sure what the Watsonian explanation would be for how someone like that could lead a gym with a type like that and still have everyone convinced they're a good guy but I guess that'd be up to the writers if this was done in a game</TEXT>

    <TEXT>That's what happened last time they called me abusive, I had a meltdown both because abusiveness, like addiction, is one of those things where saying you're not [x] in certain circumstances can make people think you are and also because of my head full of goddamn tropes which was why I was saying things mid-meltdown about how e.g. if I *am* abusive towards my parents someone should call "Parent Services" (because if you call Child Services on abusive parents...) and they should be placed with alternate/foster *children* who have a 25% chance (as the parent equivalent of this trope doesn't appear in all narratives of this sort) of being their actual birth ones and their arc involving me should either end (after all sorts of Hero's Journey things happen) with some tearful reconciliation or whatever and my reformation or me turning out to be some kind of evil supervillain they have to stop. TL;DR I am 90% certain I'm not abusive (but I'm not sure how much of that is just me not wanting to feel like I'm the villain/this isn't my story) but there's still that niggling doubt and I don't even know if it's possible to abuse one's parents in the same sense parents could abuse a child</TEXT>

    <TITLE>Did King Arthur (or anyone else in the stories but especially him) have some kind of magic shield to go with his sword in any version of the stories?</TITLE>
    <DATE>2019-06-06 18:19:03</DATE>
    <TEXT>Why I ask is because I watched the new Pokemon Direct for Pokemon Sword and Shield yesterday and of the two Legendary wolves, Zacian (the "sword wolf") was giving me mad Excalibur vibes because not just of the royal elements in its design but because its sword can supposedly cut through damn near anything which could be a PG way of representing how wounds caused by Excalibur never heal. So now I'm just wondering if somewhere in Arthuriana (or at least more than one version of the stories), Arthur (or some other important character) had some kind of magic shield that could block anything that Zamazenta could perhaps represent because that informs my idea of where the story goes (because since most of the fighting in the Pokeverse is done through Pokemon battles, the Pokemon universe version of King Arthur could have actually used those wolves instead of his "canonical" weapons and now they're just waiting for the "return of the king" in Galar's greatest hour of need or whatever)</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Salem native but 99% of the times I've been up to Portland I've eaten there and I desperately want to do something to save them if there's still time and my ideas have ranged from just find them a new spot to all still be together (even if it means we have to create one) to some kind of Rent-inspired protest to make sure they stay where they are to petitioning the city government to helping find the company that would be building on the spot another spot for whatever it is they're building (because *that* seems much easier to relocate than a food cart pod) to a "financial incentive" for the company to not build there (that is, assuming that kind of shenanigans isn't illegal for any non-1-%-er, because, hey, if corporations like that only care about money) to plans far more barely-legal inspired by my love of the show Leverage and its connection to Portland (which would only be on the table if I couldn't get caught, considering I don't have their plot-armor, which is why the other plans are much more worth considering) So what can I do to help make this change and if anyone is already working on an effort to do something about this, how can I join in?</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Looking at a lot of the reaction threads, I see a lot of stuff about people thinking Striking Vipers (which some of them perceive to have had no twist) should have had an incest twist to "truly have a mind-fuck moment" or whatever and that it would have been okay for them to get away with this because of the pig-fucking episode for some reason. Also, I've seen some people (but fewer) thinking that the real Ashley in RJAAT should have died and that that would have "actually given the episode a dark psychological question for the viewer to ponder" instead of the "happy Disney-Channel ending" we got And now my question is why? I get it that Black Mirror has become known for its twists but there's a difference between twists and "violent tech-gone-wrong fetish porn with a lesson of how human nature is garbage and a truly shocking twist" or whatever they want</TEXT>

    <DATE>2019-06-12 09:32:25</DATE>
    <TEXT>OK, so first of all it feels like people are completely overreacting about this news, not just acting like this means their favorite Pokemon are "going away" or "going to metaphorically be in jail forever" or whatever but acting like the "Dynamaxing replacing Megas and Z-Moves" thing means it'd replace them in all future games and be the permanent gimmick. However, if you're going to be angry, instead of doing things like demanding they change their slogan (and I don't dare tell those people they haven't used "Gotta Catch 'Em All" since Pokemon Crystal or they'll think that was just anticipation/"part of the plan" like what people thought about Google getting rid of "Don't Be Evil") or making shitty Thanos memes or calling Game Freak the evil team of Pokemon SwSh or saying you're not going to buy the games until they "get it right" or are done with the franchise altogether (without letting them know why so they'll just blame the drop in sales on something else altogether and not get a clue), why not do something positive with all that energy like signing the petitions out there, spreading them/your anger (but never in a hateful way) on social media, and maybe even (if it would be legal) crowdfunding some kind of thing to help with the costs (or maybe even people offering to volunteer their talents to help them make this happen, GF would be more likely to do this if they didn't have to put in the work)</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I don't have any of these fully fleshed out as a fakemon like some other Pokemon I've created but I've at least got some ideas for how they could do the really hard ones: Gemini could be a split-evo like we thought we were getting with the SuMo starters (maybe one more offensive and one tankier to represent how apparently, in the myth of Kastor and Polydeuces/Castor and Pollux which inspired the sign/constellation of Gemini, one twin was "more immortal" than the other), Virgo could be some kind of Fire/Fairy feminine-humanoid flame elemental (think, at least in its final stage, something looking like Flame Princess from Adventure Time but with giant fiery angel wings), for Libra they could do the same joke Homestuck did and make it an animal with scales (and some sort of justice symbolism) instead of, like, literal flaming scales, and for Aquarius (if they ever did do this) it could just be a Fire/Water type (maybe in a starter trio with a Grass/Fire type and a Water/Grass type) So what do you think, do you have any more ideas for the "hard zodiac signs" or any for the easier ones</TEXT>

    <DATE>2019-06-20 06:44:30</DATE>
    <TEXT>It's hard to describe how but their personalities do parallel each other, he iirc lives in a more "typical urban" environment while she lives surrounded by plants, he dresses nerdy while she wears dark clothes and round glasses (seriously, the only time that I remember seeing adult!Anathema wear something bright was her skirt in the finale and even then that wasn't real bright), he is the more anxiety-ridden one of the two, he inadvertently ended up a soldier of sorts in a war he thinks shouldn't be fought (under a too-stuck-in-the-past "commanding officer") and ended up getting called out by them for "fraternizing with the enemy" (which is her), both she and Crowley indirectly contributed to the genesis of the Antichrist by sheer accident (because she gave him those New Age magazines that ended up having their urban legends foisted upon the world when he came into his powers) etc. etc. and both of them (as in both of the both of them) working together in a combination of "incompetency" and rejection of tradition saved the world Her name even sounds semi-demonic in its "aesthetic" and there's precedent for important narrative character parallels in the show and even in the finale itself (the showdown between Adam's gang and the Four Horsemen, all in outfits and on bikes color-coordinated with each other in thematic pairs)</TEXT>

    <DATE>2019-06-22 05:00:52</DATE>
    <TEXT>Been a fan of it since I was around 13-14 and it seems like barely anyone else I know who's a theater fan knows it exists if they weren't actually in a production. Why I ask this is not just to find more fans but because if I had the power no pun intended (as "If I Had The Power" is the name of one of the songs) I would make a revival of the show happen for three reasons 1. because despite being nominated for five Tony awards in its original production including Best Musical, it won none of them, and I think it was kind of too ahead of its time, 2. (Especially since it's an original story that's a musical barely anyone knows) I think Starmites can succeed where Be More Chill's critics say it failed (especially if it's effectively modernized while keeping the 80s flair and not seeming like it's pandering) as both are geeky-teen-finds-self-and-comes-of-age-while-falling-in-love stories with similar senses of humor (Starmites just lacks the "morally-ambiguous protagonist" trope that seems to draw Tumblr to shows like Dear Evan Hansen, Heathers and Be More Chill), and 3. from Little Shop Of Horrors to Be More Chill, every sci-fi musical I've heard of other than Starmites has had a male lead (except maybe Repo! The Genetic Opera but that's more of an ensemble piece anyway) and geeky girls deserve the representation</TEXT>

    <DATE>2019-06-22 07:26:36</DATE>
    <TEXT>Telling the lore in a more serialized format (albeit occasionally time-jumping around for things like new heroes) would not only help people think of it as more coherent but it'd also prevent "lore bombs" that reveal so much they leave people's head spinning as to wtf is actually happening (especially when they also play with your emotions like that damn Baptiste story). Also, unless Overwatch decides to either go F2P and/or be able to be played on Macs in the future, a cartoon especially on a broadcast channel (Blizzard has enough clout to potentially bring back the Saturday Morning Cartoon with Overwatch as a flagship one, right?) would make the story accessible to people who couldn't afford the game and e.g. let more people feel represented by the diverse af cast perhaps (be it someday in a future like that in that sort of semi-superheroic fashion or now in other ways) inspiring them to become heroes too. And isn't that perfectly in line with the themes of the story?</TEXT>

    <DATE>2019-06-24 21:54:26</DATE>
    <TEXT>Seen a lot of people on r/Pokemon suggesting things like not only not buying Pokemon SwSh but not buying any Pokemon anything until "they make a good game" and regardless of if I think that's a good idea, I think it's a bad one if people do that and don't tell Nintendo/GameFreak why they're doing it because then all they'll see is a drop in sales and unless they're really diligent about reading their social media, they won't see why and might assume it's due to something else. Also, people were talking about this whole thing with so much venom that I'd be mad-but-not-surprised if someone suggested threatening violent action or to burn down their HQ or even took their "general hatred of Pokemon now" (the same that'd fuel them to boycott all Pokemon products) out on autistic people because the creator of Pokemon altogether is autistic. Instead, if we want this changed (regardless of when), we should try some positive lobbying, ranging from strongly-worded-yet-polite letters to persuading them to delay the game's release to even volunteering to add in all the models or whatever ourselves (because if they truly are as much of a money-hungry company as those who responded to this with this level of venom say, they should welcome a bunch of volunteers to do work for them without pay out of true passion for Pokemon and "a sense of pride and accomplishment") Whatever we do, it shouldn't be metaphorically burning down the franchise/company piece by piece until they comply, you catch more flies (or should that be Cutieflies) with honey than with vinegar</TEXT>

With that in mind, where could someone like me go to meet (ideally nerdy/geeky) young people with an eye towards continued platonic contact (as in I can't e.g. just browse bookstores and hope to find someone reading something interesting I can talk to them about but I don't want to go to a dating thing if I want to find friends)</TEXT>

    <TEXT>* Version exclusive gym leaders aren't as new as you think iirc (and please don't say people thinking it is are just gen 5 haters who are the reason GF isn't taking any risks) and am I the only one who loves both equally? * Yet again where a new trailer with a bunch of Pokemon drops and I'm meh on the one a lot of social media is freaking out about (first it was Wooloo now Alcremie) * I'd be okay with any of the speculated potential bad guys being so (Rose/Oleana, Leon, even people were thinking Sonia might be secretly evil at one point) as long as A. their motives aren't shit (like I found Lysandre's stated motives vs actions to be a little contradictory/hypocritical and not in the Team Plasma "we're going to hide our actual reason for being bad guys" way and I also just don't *get* Team Aqua) and B. the part of the story revolving around their scheme ties to the fantasy/Arthurian elements I was expecting and ISN'T MORE FUCKING SPORTS * On that note, one thing I would concede that they're being uncreative on is if someone like Leon or Rose is the evil team boss, that'd make it the third generation in a row where the boss had a name based on a flower; Lysandre - fleur de lis, Guzma - guzmania, Leon - dandelion, Rose - rose * If Megas ever return, I have a weird fan theory about how Gigantamaxing and Megas might be connected which ties into the fan game I'm trying to pitch to Nintendo/Game Freak whose lore delves a lot into the "magic subtext" of the Pokemon universe (these "gimmicks" would relate because of Mega Stones being another example of "crystal power" in the Pokemon Universe and a fan theory someone else has that I believe that, since I think you can only Dynamax your Pokemon in certain places, Dynamaxing/Gigantamaxing is connected to something like ley lines) * Just because those leaks predicted things like Gigantamaxing and a prominent Chairman character with a female assistant doesn't mean they shouldn't still be taken with a grain of salt as I think they only got her name right and not his (and wouldn't we have seen at least one of the two other rivals the leak said our character was supposed to get in that trailer, maybe not the girl as according to the leak she connected more to the story like Lillie but at least the guy)</TEXT>

    <TEXT>E.g. take an example that just happened at my house Situation: High probability that I won't get to go to a place I like to do an activity I like doing (being general in that regard because specifics don't really matter) tomorrow because arbitrary scheduling reasons What Mom and Dad said: If you're freaking out about this so much and can't handle the idea of not doing it [even though part of the real reason I was freaking out was the plan change/not knowing for sure] then maybe it's some sort of addictive ritual. What I heard: Unless you're whooping and hollering and almost literally chortling "oh frabjous day, callooh callay" like the guy in The Jabberwocky about the idea of not doing this, then it's an addictive ritual in the worst senses of both and you need to be sent to some combination of rehab and cult deprogramming that's so brutal and soul-crushing that failure means you die and they send back a robot that physically resembles you but is so "normal" in personality that e.g. if a song isn't on some Billboard Top 40 chart at the time knowing a favorite song of theirs would be relevant, they don't like it (and "passing" the program would leave your mind so broken that it might as well have had the same effect) I know this sounds twisted but this isn't the only time I've catastrophized in that direction be it relatively mild ones like thinking potentially flunking out of school means the college that I flunked out of if I did would call the admissions departments of every other college in the country that I could possibly have otherwise gotten into to inform them what a fuckup I am so I could never continue my education anywhere to the ones even more dark than my example above like my fear, when my dad shot his mouth off about cops potentially shooting me if I have a public meltdown, that not only would they do so (and somehow teleport to my location/automatically know where I am because their "disabled person acting socially unacceptable in public" senses were tingling) but place a non-regulation gun in my corpse's hand and claim I pointed it at them and they shot out of self-defense then later go on to pin every unsolved crime that occurred in my lifetime a reasonable travel distance away from where I live on me and bribe not only the "non-fiction media" to hype me up as some kind of dangerous psycho madwoman but the TV and movie industry to make stuff not only in that lane but stuff romanticizing me from their own depictions so I am forever remembered as one of the worst criminals ever</TEXT>

Graduate at/near the top of your class from a top 5 military academy and have an exemplary record of military service Step 2. Have at least one PhD in a hard science field and have graduated at/near the top of your class from those schools too Step 3. Know the right people/how to network Steps 2 and 3 are essential but (according to this person) Step 1 could be skipped if you managed to win the Nobel for one of the fields you have a degree in Seriously, why didn't they just say other requirements were being Hollywood-level conventionally-attractive-and-young-looking-no-matter-your-age, having at least a 190 IQ, having dead parents one of whom did something similar to you (either in terms of science, military or even space) and "would have wanted you to do this", having a Five-Man-Band of close friends made from your networking, and either being single or having a family</TEXT>

    <DATE>2019-08-07 18:32:36</DATE>
    <TEXT>As I can see on this sub I am literally not the only one to point out the similarities between the new team and Team Skull (punk, goofballs, no clear motive, even the similar-sounding "edgelord" name and being revealed in a similar trailer that revealed similar things about the game) and I have a theory that, just like Skull in Gen 7, they aren't the "real" evil team that much and there is a secret one. However, I think presenting Yell so much like Skull might have been a deliberate misdirection on the company's part as there'd been theories for several of the prominent already-revealed characters being secretly evil and they knew once we saw a Skull-like evil team our minds would automatically jump to the most Aether-Foundation-like characters revealed (Rose and Oleanna) being the secretly-evil leaders of the "real evil team" perhaps directing our attention away from a later-revealed character who might actually be the "Lusamine of the game" (if they're going that route again). TL;DR they've noticed our eye for spotting them being uncreative and are trying to use that to bait us out keeping the actual surprise villain a surprise</TEXT>

    <TITLE>Does anyone know of any autistic representation in urban fantasy?</TITLE>
    <DATE>2019-08-07 19:20:30</DATE>
    <TEXT>The only two examples I've found so far are Tiberius Blackthorn from one of those (I can't remember which one) series by Cassandra Clare (haven't read it because I haven't read much of her work because I have the same problem with it I have with Twilight; interesting world just not a fan of the particular stories she chooses to tell about it) and Darryl McAllister from Young Wizards (who seemed like good representation at first glance but that's because the problem wasn't with him as a character but with how his autism's treated both by the narrative and other characters, from another character literally saying [a certain plot development it'd be spoilers to reveal] probably happened because "boys are more likely to be autistic than girls" to a secondary character with strong autism coding not having her autism revealed when the author had the perfect opportunity to to his autism either being presented as a quasi-MacGuffin or a list of negative symptoms (and a vastly overblown one at that, because, unless there was something magical going on with that that I missed, who has *that* much problem with theory of mind/accepting that others exist different from them) to the fact that the ending after [another spoilery plot development] leaves it unclear whether he essentially magic-cured his autism or just made it less severe to the fact that he never really appears in a book after that still making that unclear. Anyway, all I've found other than that in terms of autistic representation (that's actually canon) in genre fiction is a bunch of sci-fi characters and a couple of "they have fantasy autism we just can't say that for setting reasons so it has to be Word Of Godded" high fantasy characters (Narset from Magic: The Gathering and Elva from the Inheritance Cycle). Is there any more (good) urban fantasy autistic representation I should know about?</TEXT>

    <TITLE>Is there a way out of this trilemma I found?</TITLE>
    <DATE>2019-08-10 09:13:29</DATE>
    <TEXT>First found it while telling my Mom about a debate I engaged in on R/collapse where I think I accidentally pissed off a racist because I was trying to poke holes in his belief that "if humans are all equal and there is only one race, the human race, then it doesn't matter if those who survive [the particular kind of SHTF the original post was about] just happen to all be light-skinned". Anyway, when I told Mom about how I responded to him with defining equality as "no one should persecute anyone for things they can't change", Mom responded with "should we persecute sociopaths because they can change their nature by going to therapy so that doesn't fit your definition". That's what led me to remember the following trilemma I thought up (which I'd also seen occurring in various sorts of social justice discourse I'd seen): When dealing with some group of "bad people" (be they malicious, ignorant etc.) especially if you want to enact social change to stop their actions, if you respond with too much harshness/punishment/whatever you're seen as a bad person for stooping to their level, if you respond with kindness you're seen as a bad person for "going easy on them" and supposedly letting them get away with things, but if you say you'll attack the root cause of their behavior on a systematic level so eventually there will be no more of that kind of person you're seen as a bad person with potential eugenicist intentions (even if your plan is something as benevolent as "educate everyone so no one's dumb") How do I get out of this loop?</TEXT>

    <DATE>2019-08-11 06:08:25</DATE>
    <TEXT>Though it's not just because of my longing for another medieval-y team like B1W1 Plasma in the England-based region, I couldn't help but feel underwhelmed by the evil team recently revealed and I'm not the only one. As others have pointed out, they do bear a lot of similarities to Team Skull; young punks (that aren't just punk but "13 year old making a DeviantArt OC" punk design-wise) with a young "leader" (quotes because we still don't know how much Marnie has to do with them if she is indeed the leader figure as they're fans of hers), a similarly-short edgelord-y name, barely any indication of a motive other than causing trouble (part of why I think they can't be the only evil team, since both them and Marnie look barely older than the player character (and Marnie was even stated in the leak that predicted them to be one of the rivals), unless they're getting way too big for their britches it's probably not them with the big world-shaking evil plan), and even being revealed in a trailer with similar info at a similar point in the reveal cycle. Anyway, all that similarity to Team Skull is I think where the misdirection lies as they know we know that, they know we've been yelling online about how uncreative we think they are and they also probably know we've been speculating "they're the secret villain" about 90% of the NPCs revealed so far so they presented Team Yell so much like Team Skull to appeal to the pattern-finders of the fandom making us think they're so uncreative that the secret leader of the second evil team would be Chairman Rose (the character presented so far as the most similar to how Lusamine was presented as in the trailer) when it's really probably someone yet to be revealed</TEXT>

Some of mine are * All of the evil team bosses from Pokemon (yes, even Ghetsis despite his treatment of the more-obviously-showing-symptoms N, I headcanon there's a lot more to that story than you think) because I headcanon "high-functioning" autistic to be the "neurotypical" neurotype of the Pokemon world * Moira from Overwatch * Tezzeret from Magic: The Gathering * Ian, Natalie, and Isabel Kabra from The 39 Clues (I headcanon all characters in the books with Cahill blood as autistic given how the family canonically includes historical figures like Thomas Jefferson, Nikola Tesla, or Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart, who were often thought to be autistic) * Captain Tangent, Dr. Two-Brains, Lady Redundant Woman, Miss Question and Mr. Big from WordGirl (sorry, PBSKids is a bit of a special interest of mine and, despite the Batman-in-the-60s level quirkiness of a lot of the villains leading them to seem like they have some autism-like symptoms, these are just the ones who read as the most autistic beyond their "quirks") * Reverse-Flash, and (if they're villainous enough to count despite ambiguous morals leaning them somewhat heroic) Pied Piper and Captain Cold from The Flash</TEXT>

    <TITLE>DAE self-abuse and then not know what to do about it?</TITLE>
    <DATE>2019-08-24 04:05:13</DATE>
    <TEXT>I'm not just talking about physical self-harm (though I hate to call it that as it makes it sound like something that I should be institutionalized for/the equivalent of the whole emo "I cut myself because I like the blood/pain/whatever" crap) that occurs when I have meltdowns but, as I may have posted examples of on other posts, I do frequently emotionally abuse myself (I call it that because it's something that would be considered emotional abuse at least if someone else did it to me). Most of the times it occurs when I screw up and takes the form of really ridiculous punishments I imagine my parents giving me like denial of all privileges, privileges meaning anything that isn't specifically delineated as a right in the declaration of human rights or (when I'm sent to my room) making me end up being stuck in my room forever by setting the requirements for getting out as HAVING DONE IN THE PAST something that would be dang near impossible to do in the present. Anyway, I'm not sure what to do. Being abused by anyone other than parents kind of breaks my internal perception of how abuse should be dealt with especially as I can't very well call the cops or whatever on myself and face myself in court (and I can't be my own "abusive parental figure I face at the end of the hero's journey and either reconcile with or defeat" unless we're doing some kind of meta allegorical Jungian archetype bullshit). I've asked my parents about getting help but they've said that I first have to prove I will listen to the shrink since I've gone to two and not appeared to take their advice but their standards of proof are a lot of the things I'd want to fix</TEXT>

Also, another hero I'm surprised people haven't talked about (since it would have to be a DPS or a tank that gets added) is Ashe, I just think her kit would be the sort of thing that could work (even with BOB, we've had Final Smashes that have/are "summons" before) and since she tends to be a rather overlooked hero this could thrust her back into the limelight.

    <TEXT>I don't know how to describe mine but these instances of it all fall under the same umbrella * closed captions with descriptions of what's happening (like [music plays] or [laughs]) but only when they're in the actual closed-captioning of a video, I have no problem with writing or reading scripts with "stage directions" like that in them * overly simplified descriptions of something (like some comment on a R/showerthoughts thread about Build-A-Bear Workshop described part of the process of, well, building a bear, as "kids say a few cute rhymes and then pick out a lovey" which also ties into my next bullet point) * overly cutesy perky anything * those "every [show] episode" or "every [band] song" posts with the aforementioned simplified descriptions and overly stereotypical dialogue and lyrics</TEXT>

    <TITLE>Does any other autistic on here have similar pet peeves?</TITLE>
    <DATE>2019-09-05 05:26:56</DATE>
    <TEXT>Posted something similar on r/aspergers and figured I'd widen my pool since not everyone with HFA/aspergers goes onto that sub. Anyway, these are a bunch of things that really get under my skin as an autistic person (albeit ones that don't have to do with autism) and I think they're all connected. * Overly-simplified descriptions of how to do something (e.g. on the post on r/aspergers I gave the example of a reply to a R/showerthoughts thread about Build-A-Bear Workshop that describes part of the bear-building process as "kids say some cute rhymes and then pick out a lovey") * On a similar note to said example (even when it isn't directed at me), when anyone who's puberty-age-and-older uses baby talk and/or talks in a really cutesy childish perky manner (including such affectations as using w in place of r) when they're not talking to a really young child (and no, it isn't just cutesy babey talk that falls under that umbrella but a lot of the stereotypical "lol i'm so random XD" scene girl stuff especially when they veered towards the perky-goth side of scene) * "Stage directions" like [laughs] or [music plays] in the closed-captions when I'm watching a video * Those posts on certain sorts of social networks that say things like "Every [show] episode ever" or "Every [artist] song ever" and then have not just similar stage directions/descriptions to the aforementioned kinds I hate but really stereotypical [dialogue, lyrics etc.] I guess, if I could find the connecting thread between said pet peeves it's that I don't like feeling dumb (the first and third fall under that umbrella because I don't like being told something I already know, the fourth because I feel like I'm getting poorly fansplained at and the second (despite being the odd one out) because when I read that kind of talk I hear that kind of voice in my head and feel like I'm getting talked down to if I'm not the target)</TEXT>

    <TITLE>Why do people seem to be so eager to tear into everything that came out about the games since the announcement of "Dexit"?</TITLE>
    <DATE>2019-09-06 17:09:21</DATE>
    <TEXT>I've seen it before with criticisms of specific Pokemon etc. (like, once we learned they would technically be "replacing" previous Pokemon, criticizing Yamper and Impidimp (the Pokemon revealed along with that announcement) for looking too dumb to be worthy of doing so because, I don't know, they had their tongue out and their eyes look derpy) but I just about internally lost my shit when I saw people doing things like blaming Currydex for Dexit while still saying it's the "new feature that'd be gone in a year" or even saying that Gen 9 would focus on the cooking to the exclusion of the Pokemon. Sheesh, I get the feeling that even if Gen 9 somehow found a way to add the National Dex back in, y'all still wouldn't be happy because "they missed their chance to have done it in Gen 8 so I'm boycotting these games too" or some crap like that. What would please you, a (pardon my exaggeration for effect) FIVR generation of the games where you can be a plot-armored protagonist on a multi-region journey and (thanks to the game reading your mind) the characters you have a crush on will be your age (or at least your character's) and able to date you and only the gimmicks, characters, storylines etc. you accept as canon will exist? Seriously, a lot of you don't even seem to want to fix things (be it through anything from petitions to becoming/forming the new dev team you say GF should hand the games to) and just be "old fan yells at cloud"</TEXT>

    <DATE>2019-09-10 21:31:57</DATE>
    <TEXT>(Just a place to share funny "yeah, I play too much Overwatch" sorts of moments) E.g. * When you are so let down by the idea of being older than the entire current roster by the time the lore would be set that you want to fast-track (in the same general sense people who want to live in a Star Trek world wouldn't want to die in some nuclear WWIII or to not encounter anything cool if their ship wasn't named Enterprise or Discovery) the kind of future shown in the lore so you get the chance to be a part of it and when you want to do that so much that you back-burner any ideas for scientific breakthroughs that the lore contradicts (e.g. since they still have airports I can't try to replace planes with passenger zeppelins and since heroes like Ana and Sigma still look old I can't cure all physical symptoms of aging) * When you blame the Overwatch fandom for the increased prominence of Latin music on the radio/Billboard Hot 100 (because I remember a little while after launch people were questioning how Lucio could have achieved the Beyonce-tier stardom the lore says he has with the kind of music he's implied to make, but then Despacito happened and now music from Central/even South America is freaking everywhere) * When you choose where you sit in restaurants etc. based on "let's not go where a sniper would be able to hit me from" (although that is kind of blameable on Criminal Minds too) * When, as an aspiring pro gamer, you choose a gamer handle for said "esports games" that would make a good "superhero" name because, even if the mechanics of the games you play (well, apart from Overwatch) may not be as directly transferrable to fighting a potential threat as D.va's, you still kinda secretly hope your country starts some kind of elite gamer soldier task force a la MEKA and if they do like hell you're going to pass up a slot * When you design superhero characters' ability sets (even for other fandoms like Miraculous Ladybug) as if you were designing them for the Overwatch roster * When you're surprised (if it's not just my imagination) no one's noticed the Talon T looks a lot like the Tesla T given how popular it is (or at least was) to think of Elon Musk as some kind of supervillain in the making/in disguise * When you always pick the Overwatch-expy-character companion options in CYOAs no matter how much it fucks up the rest of your build/forces it into a corner (some examples; there's a version of McCree on the Wild West CYOA and Expies of Tracer and D.va in the Defender Of The Universe CYOA)</TEXT>

    <TITLE>Why are we apparently not getting a Galar anime?</TITLE>
    <DATE>2019-09-11 02:47:44</DATE>
    <TEXT>I don't mean why is the current (if it's true) information known about the anime true but why in that case are they snubbing whatever the story of SwSh turns out to be because I have high hopes we're going to get something really cool in those games (at least story-wise) and I actually have written the beginnings of a fanfic that's basically intended to be "that anime season" but even if we were confirmed to get a Galar anime I'd still be unlikely to successfully pitch my fic because it features the return of a past-gen character who I've always thought had some connection to the region but who I doubt they'd want to use again. Anyway, that aside, with all the controversy that's going on over the games themselves (unless this is *because* of us which I highly doubt), why make what seems like such a controversial decision regarding the anime in what is otherwise still such a controversial gen? Also, I refuse to believe this is either a victory lap (because then why call it just Pokemon instead of some even more special name) or a reboot (because why and why now especially if it'd keep the same main)?</TEXT>

    <TEXT>For me it was two crazy ideas that'd otherwise be worthy of r/crazyideas if they weren't so inherently political that they'd get downvote swarmed, and they both were ways to channel the reasons for the vaping crackdown into cracking down on police brutality. If it's because of that whole thing with the tobacco bonds (look it up if you can find an unbiased source), create some alternative to traditional law enforcement (perhaps some kind of "superhero team" like something out of Kick-Ass) and have that organization somehow pay lawmakers in bonds in a similar way so they'll crack down on the competitor (traditional law enforcement) like how they cracked down on vaping. If their motives are at least more genuine, then spread a bunch of anonymous fake news (as in actually faked news articles) to right-wing news outlets online etc. about how supposed police brutality is just an elaborate way for minority young people who want to die to prove their "street cred" by committing suicide by cop (in order to make police brutality sound like as dangerous a teen fad as flavored vaping)</TEXT>

    <TITLE>Two Color Trials In One</TITLE>
    <DATE>2019-09-13 18:31:10</DATE>
    <TEXT>**What can you tell us about your goals and dreams? What motivates you to pursue them and how exactly do you do it? What is keeping you breathing?** I have a lot of goals but most of them I think fall under two broad categories. The first broad  #8220;major goal #8221; is basically True Companions (in as close as a real person can get to the TV-Trope sense). I watch and read a lot of fiction with the whole  #8220;group of flawed-yet-lovable-misfits gradually becoming a found-family #8221; trope and as someone who #8217;s always considered herself a bit socially awkward, I would do anything for that kind of stable group to  #8220;be a piece of the puzzle #8221; of. While I do try to make friends when I can, I often think part of me justifies my own staying in my loner-y rut with  #8220;the more I fall into the archetype of the nerdy loner who typically ends up leading such a group [a la Flynn from The Librarians or Walter from Scorpion] the more likely it is I #8217;ll get them dumped on me and have to learn to bond with them after so much being alone #8221;. My second goal is immortality in not just the usual sense. While I would love to be physically immortal especially if I could give it to my loved ones/others I deem worthy as well (I just kinda secretly wouldn #8217;t want everyone immortal as a lot of my special interests are connected to death somehow, from forensic science to Halloween to goth culture, and I wouldn #8217;t want those to go away/stagnate), I would also like to be metaphorically immortal through my deeds as well (I #8217;ve often said that if I *have* to die I want the whole world to mourn/remember me, I just would tear my hair out from [wherever comes next] if I had to see people centuries from now arguing over my morality/trying to  #8220;cancel #8221; me for something I didn #8217;t know was wrong at the time a la the discourse that came in the wake of Hamilton the musical about if the Founding Fathers were bad people for owning slaves) and I help facilitate that through the many kinds of creative work I hope to write (from movies to books to TV to comics, it #8217;s a subgoal-of-that-goal of mine to get at least one creative work of each medium made in my lifetime). **Tell us a little bit about yourself and your personality. How do you act, and what is important to you aside your goals?** I am something of a really really smart person (was reading at 12th grade level in 1st grade) and have had a complicated relationship with said intelligence as, thanks to pop culture portrayals of super-smart characters with Aspergers Syndrome (which I have), I always thought  #8220;if I #8217;m smart school will come easy for me and if it doesn #8217;t I must not actually be smart #8221; when it #8217;s really my executive dysfunction that #8217;s the problem. Speaking of executive dysfunction, that makes me basically the world #8217;s crappiest perfectionist regarding my work as I get stuck in this feedback loop of  #8220;set impossible standards for myself, fail to meet them, beat myself up for failing, promise to try harder next time, repeat #8221;. With regards to my emotions, I, as I said before, am a bit of a loner introvert but when I #8217;m with the few friends I #8217;ve had over the years it #8217;s as if all the introvert filters drop away and I could just talk with (and sometimes kinda at) them for hours if the world let us. I also have what I #8217;d say was a hair-trigger temper except I don #8217;t really show classic signs of anger when I get mad, I just get sad-mad. Most of the time what triggers this (and often semi-explosive crying jags at least when I was little) comes in two forms, either some major disappointment or disruption has f-ed with the plan I had for the day/near future or some social injustice has offended my sense of justice and I feel like I can #8217;t do anything about it (but sometimes my compassion explodes like that when an issue is solved too, like with gay marriage being legalized, because I #8217;m mad that the issue had to exist in the first place). Speaking of social justice, that #8217;s a lot of where my scheming side comes out as I #8217;m constantly thinking up sneaky ways (partially inspired by my love of the show Leverage/what they do on there) to make political change by somehow conning the political establishment (like bringing up the common  #8220;politicians reveal their donors by wearing their patches on their outfits like NASCAR drivers #8221; idea but not as a serious proposal, as blackmail so those with donors worth hiding cut ties out of fear) or the unwashed masses (like making a movie with a story that #8217;s a fantasy/sci-fi allegory for some social issue, making a percentage of sales go to charities surrounding that issue, and not telling anyone who didn #8217;t work on the movie either fact so I can see how many people #8217;s minds on the issue were changed by the movie) into changing without knowing it. But social justice isn #8217;t the only place I love loopholes, I #8217;m always trying to exploit the rules I don #8217;t like to do what I want and still have it technically comply with the wishes of a higher authority. When I #8217;m not doing that kind of shenanigans I like writing (as I mentioned above), listening to music, reading, gaming and thrift shopping (it #8217;s more of an adventure than going to the mall). **What are you looking for in a partner or friend? Which is to say, what aspects of humanity do you value the most about humanity?** If I were to phrase my  #8220;type #8221; in terms of general aspects of humanity I value, it #8217;d be loyalty, humor (but not the immature kind), kindness, idealism, intelligence, and self-expression (a lot of my celebrity or fictional crushes either are notable for their even-considered-quirky-by-their-own-crowd #8217;s-standards fashion style and/or for an amazing singing voice). If I #8217;m specifically looking for a potential very close friend or romantic partner then not only does sharing a significant percentage of my interests (and being willing to tolerate the rest of them) get added to that list as well as open communication channels/no secrets (both in the let me know any baggage from your past and  #8220;if you want to end things, tell me, don #8217;t just walk out or stop returning my calls #8221; senses) **You are granted a super-human ability, what would you choose and how would you wield that power?** I choose the power of mind-reading, because even when I #8217;d need to manipulate people (which I sometimes might need to do if I want to accomplish the social change I dream of), what good is direct mind control when I can just poke around in someone #8217;s headspace to find out what drives them and then make my pitch for whatever I want them to do accordingly so they #8217;re already motivated without me having to force my way in. And even in non-grifter-y-shenanigan scenarios, being a telepath would have many benefits such as helping bridge the social awkwardness gap by getting a heads-up on what potential new friends might be like/help us find something in common. At least that #8217;s what I #8217;d choose if it had to be some specific  #8220;superpower #8221; and couldn #8217;t just be magic in general as I am something of an armchair witch (who #8217;d love her pagan practice to be able to manifest as real magic a la Buffy The Vampire Slayer and Willow #8217;s Wicca). But even then my magic would still have kind of an intellectual bent and some things I #8217;d naturally be drawn to in a full-magic world even more than I am now would be divination and Indiana-Jones-esque treasure hunting (as if I had magic in a universe where magic was common (be it urban fantasy proper or something more like the MtG multiverse) I #8217;d totally want to combine said magic skill with my art history degree to keep old magickal doodads out of the bad guys #8217; hands) **What is something that people do or value that you have a hard time comprehending why?** Maybe this is just my Aspergers theory of mind problems talking but why does the lowest common denominator exist? Seriously, whenever I listen to mumble rap (on the radio, mind you, I never seek it out) or watch something like The Simpsons or hear about the latest bit of news from some reality star or other or what #8217;s been happening with football, I can #8217;t fathom why people like this shit when at least according to me there #8217;s much more interesting media to consume and even much more interesting sports to follow if you *must* follow sports. Even regarding fashion, can #8217;t people just express themselves through things they find themselves (using media for help if they need to) instead of letting a magazine dictate what they have to wear or abandon each season. **Before the trail is finished and our conclusions given, here is an opportunity to say anything we would not have ever think of asking, something to better conceal your attitudes and idiosyncrasies. Please, make it entertaining:** * Despite identifying a lot with fictional villains (which shouldn #8217;t affect my colors as evil knows no one color identity) and being told I have traits a lot of people would consider villainous like the aforementioned manipulativeness or power-hungriness etc., there #8217;s still a thread of activism running through that as the fictional villains I like are (unless they do something to make them nosedive out of my sympathy-for-the-devil good graces like killing a heroic character I like or having one too many parallels to the Nazis for my Jewish dumb butt to handle) often the ideologues with some grand vision to build a better world the heroes just happen to oppose and my power-hungriness is for the same motivation as theirs, power to influence others so I can enact my idea of what creating a better tomorrow looks like * I am so much into science (and getting other people hype about science) that I feel like I should have to be a scientist for credibility purposes but whenever I take a science class, I can understand the theory/academic side of the material but I just can #8217;t do the labs. * My favorite music genres are emo, folk-punk (The Mountain Goats, Neutral Milk Hotel etc.), the kind of indie they play on Welcome To Night Vale, and especially show tunes (the more rock-influenced the better), but I have been getting more and more into the current pop charts with my favorite contemporary Top 40 artists being Ed Sheeran and Billie Eilish but I do love the new Taylor Swift album and I hope Old Town Road spawns more stylistic country-hop follow-ups than just The Git Up. * If I could be a character (as myself but with canon-typical skillset) in any fictional universe other than the MtG multiverse I #8217;d choose the universe of the show The Orville because it has everything that #8217;d make the Star Trek universe appealing but with 20th/21st century pop culture getting remembered and without such things as a brutal nuclear war in the backstory and transporters-that-might-as-well-just-be-kill-and-clone-you-machines. **3 Cry Deeply Moments** * When my parents couldn #8217;t shake the feeling that I wasn #8217;t telling them my grades for weeks because I had seen them and they were bad (because  #8220;I #8217;ve lied before about that #8221;) even though I TOLD them the school website wasn #8217;t working and I couldn #8217;t even see my grades and even though when the site got back to working I got straight As * Whenever I #8217;m debating philosophical/social issues online and see people talk about humanity like we #8217;re an utter garbage species (e.g.  #8220;if you participate in society at all, you #8217;re a hypocrite for wanting to take down the rich/megacorps (and should be guillotined/eaten/whatever you want to do to the rich) because they wouldn #8217;t make stuff that hurts the environment if people didn #8217;t want it #8221; or  #8220;humanity won #8217;t make any substantial progress in space exploration without another war and existential threat because that #8217;s what it took last time #8221; or basically everything on R/collapse) based on the action (or often inaction) of a few * When a high school acquaintance of mine committed suicide, and no, not just because she did, but because apparently I #8217;d somehow gotten the idea into my head that the suicide was my fault for, of all things, not having been born in her year so I #8217;d have been in the same class and therefore better friends with her and therefore potentially able to save her **3 Happy Moments** * Three semesters straight of straight As after a couple of really rough ones * When thanks to about half of it graduating, my best friend and I got to take over the high school book club as co-leaders and took an Oregon Battle Of The Books team to state * Watching the pilot of  #8220;art history action-adventure #8221; show Blood  amp; Treasure and feeling like, because it had a similar subgenre with a few similar plot beats and some of the same actors, it filled the hole in my heart that similar show The Librarians had left by its cancellation a few years prior **Someone I Admire** * A real person I admire is Adam  #8220;Owl City #8221; Young, not just because he has Aspergers as well but because I would metaphorically kill to be able to songwrite that poetic and I love how he turned his personal issues into strengths (Fireflies may have been somewhat metaphorical about the fireflies but he does or at least did have insomnia and channeled that into making music like it) * A fictional character I admire is Penelope Garcia from Criminal Minds, not just for her  #8220;l33t hacking skillz #8221; but how she can manage to stay sane enough doing such a dangerous job with so much traumatic stuff she has to see to be the bright spot of humor, hope and idealism that the rest of the team needs.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I'm currently taking college classes online and the last time I tried to take a science class at my school, I failed because the labs had to be done physically "irl" with a lab report written up and sent to the professor and my particular brand of disability made doing the labs very very difficult but their Disability Services office wouldn't make any accommodations. So I figured, if there is some science class at some reputable online college that doesn't require the labs be done irl, I could just take it there and transfer the credit over (as I need to take a science for my degree).

    <TEXT>So anyway, as I said in the title, I have Aspergers syndrome and given that we've gotten representation for that in Broadway plays and several heavily-subtextually-autistic characters in recent hit Broadway musicals (especially Be More Chill), the next logical step should be a canonically autistic/Aspie lead in a musical (ideally a teenager because that's what seems to be the "trend of the moment" and ideally a girl because there's so many male Aspies in fiction and not enough women) However, I don't know what kind of plot I should weave around this Aspie high school girl, should it be some classic "acceptance narrative" centered around the Aspergers but not seeming like she's having to overcome it (if so, how do I do that without inspiration porn) or should it not be a part of the main plot (but perhaps a subplot) and if that how can I do that without seeming like I'm just "tacking on the disability after the fact to an existing show" and what kind of main plot should I go for (should it be realistic like Mean Girls or The Prom, "genre-fiction" like Be More Chill or Starmites, or somewhere in the middle like Heathers)</TEXT>

There is precedent for such a split as Magic: The Gathering has R/MagicTCG for gameplay discussions (albeit still having the occasional story post especially early-in-expansion) and R/Vorthos for those who want to focus on the story</TEXT>

    <DATE>2019-09-15 18:04:08</DATE>
    <TEXT>Sure I've seen people bring up the marketing angle but even that is mostly talking about Ash himself and no one notices the elephant, or rather the EleRodent, in the room. They can't have a non-Ash protagonist because of Ash's association with Pikachu and how Pikachu is basically the Pokemon mascot/iconic Pokemon so given its prominence and all the special stuff Pikachu's gotten they can't really just introduce a new protagonist with a different starter Pokemon that they'd then have to replace Pikachu with as Pokemon mascot (which would include everything from changing all the merchandise, to breaking the trend of "regional Pikachus" in new games, to adding that new Pokemon as a Smash DLC fighter to balance Pikachu being already on the roster). TL;DR they can't have someone who isn't Ash be the protagonist because they can't abandon Pikachu as mascot and shoehorning in an excuse (that doesn't involve Ash abandoning his to give to someone else because he'd never) to give a new protagonist a Pikachu would be too obvious</TEXT>

    <TITLE>Any fans of the TV show Psych on here think the musical episode would make a good stage musical?</TITLE>
    <DATE>2019-09-17 07:46:20</DATE>
    <TEXT>I mean it does seem more friendly to it than others of that kind because it's in two one-hour "acts", it explains the premise of the show (to some degree e.g. it doesn't explain why he had to put on that fake psychic act in the first place, just that he does) in the opening number, and unlike other musical episodes like those for Buffy The Vampire Slayer (though that one does also seem like it'd make a cool Broadway show) or Once Upon A Time, there's no Watsonian explanation for why the characters are singing. Also, Broadway does love a good show about showbiz and the Bad-Guy-Of-The-Week in this episode is an escaped mental patient/former musical theater writer whose descent into madness started when he learned someone had invited press to previews of his Jack The Ripper musical. The only flaw I can see (other than the bad press it'd get for being a "franchise musical") is that it could use some expansion in both plot and songs (which is fine, gives the writers something to do other than just translate the TV script to the stage) because a lot of the non-reprise songs are under three minutes and some even under two and if you subtract commercial time it'd have a runtime of approximately 90 minutes which is too short for a typical musical. Anyway, otherwise I think this could work and I've already started dreamcasting e.g. if we aren't using the original cast again I think Jeremy Jordan would make an awesome Shawn but I'm stumped on Gus as I can't think of anybody (be they actual Broadway stars, singers-who-can-act or actors-who-can-sing) of the right age, voice type, and skin darkness (if I were in charge of this production I'd want to make sure Gus is played by a dark-skinned black guy because his race is actually somewhat plot-relevant and I want a dark-skinned actor because I want them to be able to see he's black from the cheap seats)</TEXT>

One's from a musical (like the characters on my comment on the last post) that I haven't seen anyone type the characters of and one's a character from a slightly-more-popular non-musical fandom whose type has rather been hotly debated among the fans into typology. **1) Shiloh Wallace from Repo! The Genetic Opera** "Sometimes I wanted to cry when the people on TV were not quite the way we were. Somehow I guess I just knew. I didn't know I'd love you so much...but I do" "From my window. I can see the world from there. Name the stars and constellations, count the cars and watch the seasons"  #8220;Didn #8217;t you say that you #8217;d protect me, didn #8217;t you?

Stay with the dead, I #8217;m joining the living #8221;  #8220;But the truth is my legacy is not up to my genes. True, though the imprint is deep in me, it will always be up to me, up to me #8221; **2) Claudia Donovan from Warehouse 13**  #8220;What kind of advice is  #8220;Be yourself #8221; when myself is a giant freakazoid? #8221;  #8220;It #8217;s called a present. You #8217;re familiar with presents, right? We earthlings exchange them as a sign of affection and gratitude #8221;  #8220;Funny story.

    <TEXT>So I had this crazy idea that it'd be cool if Salem had a Halloween Festival. As for what it'd entail, think something like the UFO Festival in McMinnville (costume parade, costume contest, vendors, games for kids, lectures over at Willamette, perhaps a ghost tour etc. etc.). Here are some reasons why I think we should have such a festival * Gives young adults (as people don't magically lose the Halloween spirit when they're too old to trick-or-treat and get it back when they have kids) something to do that doesn't "require" (via social pressure) mass consumption of alcohol * Bring tourism to Salem in the off-season (as in not in the summer) * "Honor its namesake" as, if a lot of other cities named after historic cities can have allusions to them (like Plymouth, Michigan having a hotel named The Mayflower), why can't at least one Salem get as spooky as the Massachusetts one? * Help revitalize downtown Salem like there have been so many civic initiatives to do in my lifetime with varying degrees of success * Unite a lot of the existing Halloween-y events occurring on or near that date under one umbrella So, who here would want a Halloween Festival and how can we make it happen either this year (despite only having a month left until that holiday) or next year as an official civic thing?</TEXT>

So I asked them if, if antinatalists are truly as interested in "evangelizing" as they've made themselves out to be, it'd be a moral imperative to find a way to give those animals that capacity for that kind of thought so they're capable of potentially becoming antinatalists (as, whatever the reason, a natalist is a natalist).

    <TEXT>Just asking because it recently transferred to the West End and basically it could be considered a "Black Mirror musical" (albeit by everyone except the kind of gatekeeping assholes who thought the twist of Striking Vipers should have been incest rape, as it does have a happy ending). It's definitely worth checking out for the Black-Mirror-level story (to which there is a twist, but the show's one fault is that if you're genre-savvy enough the twist is kind of telegraphed early) and awesome electronica score and it does have two things I wish Black Mirror would have in an episode. One is being a musical itself (I want to see if, even if it'd have to be an extra-long episode, they could make a musical episode without doing any kind of meta bullshit with the twist with the fact that it's a musical) and the other is its plot focusing around how technology affects teenagers specifically (as the Tech-That-Goes-Wrong-A-La-Black-Mirror is supposed to help the uncool kids become cool). I know I didn't give a lot of plot but frankly the less known about this show before you see it or at least listen to the soundtrack, the better</TEXT>

    <TITLE>Trying my hand at designing a hero; need help finessing some things mechanically</TITLE>
    <DATE>2019-10-08 08:58:07</DATE>
    <TEXT>As the title says, whether or not Blizzard would accept a pitched fan character, I want to design a hero to the point that they could be added (i.e. all details of mechanics thought through enough to the point where they could be a viable non-broken hero) but I'm having some trouble. Just like how writers are often advised to write what they want to read, I want to design the kind of hero I'd want to play. The problem is, the kinds of heroes I like to play are supports and what I like to call "utility"/"disruptors" (Mei, Symmetra, Sombra etc.) and I'm not sure how to effectively fuse those kinds of playstyles in a way that's different from what Brigitte does (which I'm trying to avoid for 3 reasons, 1. differentiation, 2. Brigitte is still supposed to be somewhat of a tank whereas this OC I create (though still capable of dealing significant damage) would have both feet firmly planted in support, 3. if my character gets pitched and added I don't want the playerbase ganging up on them like they did Brigitte). So does anyone have any kind of tips on how to create a "utility healer" hero (asking for mechanics advice only with the only lore I'd want being potential ideas of "flavoring" the abilities instead of just saying what they should do, I've got an idea of what I want to do with their story (that I can't say because spoilers if they get added) and e.g. alignment, who they know etc. but it doesn't seem to lend itself to making them have a viable kit concept or at least one doesn't jump out at me)?</TEXT>

    <TITLE>If the pattern holds, what US state would you like to see as the region basis for Gen 9's main series games?</TITLE>
    <DATE>2019-10-08 18:41:17</DATE>
    <TEXT>What I mean by pattern is gens 5 and 7 were both set in places based on the US (New York and Hawaii respectively) and likewise for gens 6 and 8 being set in a place based on a European country (France and the UK respectively), so if that pattern holds the setting for gen 9 will be based on a US state. So which state would you want to see? Personally, other than Oregon (my home state which I'm actually trying to make a fangame set in), the state I'd most want to see a Pokemon region based on is Michigan. There's just so many different areas you could effectively translate to create a really diverse region, especially because due to the near-separation of the peninsulas culturally they basically feel like two different states. I'm not sure what the main legendaries/story of the game would be (as it doesn't have to connect to the irl region basis as long as it can "go with it" e.g. the only connection between Hawaii and space is that one observatory that already had a parallel regardless of main story) but I am pretty sure about some things at least if I had my druthers. Either the grass or water (as water starters, according to the pattern, are all animals that like spending time in water but can walk on land) starter of a Michigan-based region would be a moose (with probably a Fighting secondary type because, well, have you ever seen a moose in action), there would be some "extra Legendary" or Mythical you'd find on some remote island in one of the equivalent of the Great Lakes, the fossil-reviving facility would be in the Upper Peninsula with the idea being that they first found those fossils underground while digging out mine tunnels (mining for metal (especially copper) and gems is freaking huge up there), and there would be an automotive-themed Steel-type gym in the "regional big city" that would be based on Detroit. So which state would you like to see as the Gen 9 region basis and can you think up some details about this potential region (gyms, starters, legendaries, important locations etc.) like I did?</TEXT>

    <TEXT>The evidence they don't came from me finding a post wishing they did while searching for the Tarot Birth Card Calculator on Reddit (because that post had the words birth and card) but I remember them having it already but weirdly enough, I only remember one specific character birthday and that was D.va's which was sometime in early May (5th-6th-7th-ish) and, while that wasn't the only reason I remember only it, I remember that one standing out to me because if you look at the lore on her so far she doesn't seem like a Taurus and yet according to this source I saw she was (then I remembered to consider the full chart and that her rising sign was probably something like Sagittarius which her personality fits more so) Why this issue matters to me is because of all the possibilities that having canon birthdays for the heroes offers to the game, anything from birthday victory poses to skins themed after the heroes' zodiac signs (which wouldn't necessarily have to be directly based on the symbol e.g. a hero who's a Pisces could just get something like that "creature from the black lagoon" skin Doomfist (while I'm not saying he's a Pisces) got) to even getting a bonus lootbox if you play a hero on their birthday and, if they already have the canon birthdays revealed, this is a huge missed opportunity</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I ask because the protagonist of a TV show I'm trying to write (I'm a screenwriter) is an INTP 4w5 and the two other pairs mentioned in the title (ISFP 4w3 and INFP 4w5) are the two characters for which the love triangle between her and them will form a lot of the early romantic subplot of the show. However, I want to resolve said triangle before the end of the show to not make it feel like it's reliant on it but in what I've written so far, in trying to make the two love interests for the heroine equally compelling I made it hard for myself to choose who's going to be endgame. The reason why I decided to leave it up to compatibility of their typologies is A. because why not, if they're both equally good otherwise and B. because I didn't want to have to provide details and therefore accidentally spoil the show preemptively if this thing gets picked up by telling you more about the characters than just their MBTI and Enneagram. So, as the title says, which pair would be a better match based solely on types; INTP 4w5 x ISFP 4w3 or INTP 4w5 x INFP 4w5</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I flaired this as general because it applies in general but the fandom that made me want to ask this was Frozen because I saw someone claim that because she made him, should Elsa die (as we're dealing with things Watsonianly not just what Disney would or wouldn't show), Olaf counts as her son enough to have a greater claim to succeed her on the throne than Anna</TEXT>

    <TEXT>For me, the confirmed Pokemon I'd most like to see a Gigantamax form for is Chandelure, and the idea I had for said form is one that I originally conceived of as a Mega Chandelure (because I think Megas will return in Gen 9) but then decided it would be too flashy; some really big really intricate crystal chandelier with multiple tiers and a bunch of little crystals (the kind of thing you'd see hanging in some royal palace)</TEXT>

    <TITLE>Since it probably isn't racism, why aren't there any Baptiste spawn interactions yet?</TITLE>
    <DATE>2019-10-22 02:48:49</DATE>
    <TEXT>I add the caveat at the front of my question because I just saw and had to report a really toxic-to-the-point-of-being-kinda-racist-itself (and not in the sense of "oh you said something bad about a hero of color, that's racist") anti-Baptiste post claiming that his Halloween spray having kid!him not in a costume (though I think that is intended to reflect his not-well-off chaotic background) was a perfect symbolic summation of what he adds to the game/lore, nothing. What the poster meant by this is they were mad that he came out of nowhere with no lore hints (when the same also applies to heroes like Ashe and Moira), that other than his temporary association with Talon his lore gave him no real connection to any other heroes already on the roster, that nothing in his abilities reflects things like the statement in his bio that he has "the Devil's own luck" or his respawn line about someone watching over him from above or whatever and "we just got combat medic #4" instead (even though, if there was a way to reflect those things in his kit in the low-to-no-magic milieu of the lore while keeping him a support, this person would probably just either call him some kind of "support Reaper" or echo the comparison they actually made about how "they just put him in because people wanted the black concept Mercy" (I see the similar vibe but, racist much)) and, more to my point, they somehow (paradoxically for all their Baptiste hate like I've stated above) think Blizzard's racist for apparently not giving him spawn interactions yet when they gave them to Sigma. I'm sorry if the title might seem a little misleading but I do genuinely want to know Blizzard's going to add them and I just had to get all this bullshit anti-Baptiste toxicity and my reaction thereto off my chest for the same reason because, well, let's just say he means a lot to me as a character for rather complicated reasons and leave it at that</TEXT>

    <TITLE>DAE think the leaks are fake and "Overwatch 2" isn't actually going to be a sequel just an expansion?</TITLE>
    <DATE>2019-10-29 22:11:35</DATE>
    <TEXT>Points I see against the leaks being true * Not only have a lot of games (like Pokemon) had legit-seeming leaks that turned out to be fake (remember those starters for SwSh, or the theory that Ultra Beasts were beings that could shapeshift between "Pokemon form" and human form and were the true identities of a lot of the major SuMo NPCs) but those have even happened for both Overwatch (like Hammond being a monkey or Genji getting a ice-themed skin for Winter Wonderland 2017 or the expansion coming out *last* Blizzcon) and for what-Blizzard-might-do-for-Blizzcon (since as I recall, we didn't get Diablo 4 last year)? * The rumored level/upgrade/whatever system would completely unbalance the PvP making the already-OP heroes so strong even buffed versions of the ones-needing-buffs (which would guaranteed-get-buffs with that system) couldn't keep up * Not only did those leaks say Sojourn (the chick from Storm Rising), the black woman a lot of fans want on the roster, would be Hero 32 but one of them even wrongfully called her Echo (which any true fan or insider would know was the name of the robot girl from the Reunion short) * If the story mode mission the leaks say Lucio would get would be what I think it will, then (unless it's a prequel to those events) why make it happen with the update now and not to tie into the release of The Hero of Numbani (forthcoming Overwatch YA novel in which Lucio apparently plays an important role) * The leaks look too good to be true, why would they let not only so much stuff but stuff that official/important leak before Blizzcon ruining the surprise * Overwatch is too new a game to get a "sequel update" * Why would the base game go free to play and still not be available on Macs</TEXT>

    <TITLE>Help Me Find My MBTI/Enneagram</TITLE>
    <DATE>2019-10-30 03:37:36</DATE>
    <TEXT>(I think I know what it is but the Enneagram/MBTI combination I think I have is super rare so I'd love a second opinion to determine if I actually *am* that or not)  #8226; How old are you? What's your gender? Give us a general description of yourself. 23F  #8226; Is there a medical diagnosis that may impact your mental stability somehow? Officially diagnosed with autism but unofficially-diagnosed ADD and self-diagnosed BPD  #8226; Describe your upbringing. Did it have any kind of religious or structured influence? How did you respond to it? I #8217;m not sure how to describe the structuredness or not of my upbringing. In terms of parental strictness, it usually only came out when they got mad (although when said incidents happened, my catastrophizing autistic brain usually kicked into overdrive and engaged in a bit of self-abuse to make the things my parents said to me sound worse than they actually were, I #8217;m not sure why but one theory of mine based on my love of TV Tropes is that I thought that the worse they were to me the more likely I #8217;d end up going on some heroic ending-up-saving-the-world quest to get away from them, y #8217;know  #8220;heroes don #8217;t have happy families #8221;). The other major structural influence in my life has been my Jewish faith, which I #8217;ve kind of had a weird relationship with between trying to balance being kinda-sorta (due to lack of supplies in my conservative-ass town) Wiccan with it even though the Torah says a bunch of bull-dookie about witches that made me afraid my congregation would hate me, wanting to get overly fanatical (but not to ultra-orthodox levels) after my Bat Mitzvah because I thought you were supposed to, and balancing my love of watching videos etc. where creationist craziness gets debunked with the fact that oftentimes the atheists doing the debunking do it in such a way to take pot-shots at all religions.  #8226; What do you do as a job or as a career (if you have one)? Do you like it? Why or why not? I write picture books and I like doing so although (other than the uphill battle of getting them published) my biggest struggle has been the fact that I want to do them all in rhyming verse but don #8217;t want to always use the same rhythm pattern (da-DA da-DA da-DA da-DA/da-DA da-DA da-DA)  #8226; If you had to spend an entire weekend by yourself, how would you feel? Would you feel lonely or refreshed? Lonely, because (since I assume you mean at my house) one can only read, surf the net and watch crime drama reruns (as that #8217;s basically most of what interesting #8217;s on my not-having-cable TV during the daytime) for so long before it starts to make me feel a little empty and I have to keep the TV playing in the other room sending the bill sky-high just to have other voices in the house)  #8226; What kinds of activities do you prefer? Do you like, and are you good at sports? Do you enjoy any other outdoor or indoor activities? The sports I like (as in follow/like watching) are baseball, gymnastics, figure skating (although that I watch mainly for the songs and outfits than actual technical skill), and archery and out of those, the only ones I can do to some degree of skill are baseball (though I #8217;m a better pitcher than batter) and archery. I also like playing badminton and ping-pong when I can. The only other  #8220;outdoorsy #8221; outdoor activity I like (other than stuff that just happens to be outdoors) is camping, and by that I mean tent camping, not some kind of glamping crap that basically might as well be  #8220;live in a house in the middle of the forest without neighbors or wi-fi #8221;. The indoor activities I like are, as I mentioned before, reading, watching TV and surfing the net but I also like tabletop gaming, video gaming, listening to music and thrift-shopping.  #8226; How curious are you? Do you have more ideas then you can execute? What are your curiosities about? What are your ideas about - is it environmental or conceptual, and can you please elaborate? I consider myself a very curious person however there are times when I #8217;m investigating some history mystery (as much as your average twenty-something could do, y #8217;know, I #8217;m not some kind of adventure show protag) and my desire to find out what really happened is balanced out by a desperate desire to have the  #8220;weird #8221; explanation be true (e.g. the only thing keeping me from being disappointed people have pretty much solved the mystery of the Lost Colony Of Roanoke is that a lot of the supernatural explanations for it given by fiction like Supernatural or Haven are threats that I doubt I #8217;d be equipped to handle and I don #8217;t know who else would be fighting). I do have a lot of ideas for fiction writing but I don #8217;t often put all of them into practice due to the fact that it #8217;s just kind of too many and not many I feel are original enough.  #8226; Would you enjoy taking on a leadership position? Do you think you would be good at it? What would your leadership style be? Yes, I would definitely enjoy a leadership position. I love feeling like I #8217;m the one who has the control because then I know for sure people are going to hear my ideas. I #8217;m not sure what my style would be in practice but in theory I think I might end up accidentally manipulating people/being a controlling prick just because I want to make sure the thing I #8217;m leading everybody in doing is done up to my standards.  #8226; Are you coordinated? Why do you feel as if you are or are not? Do you enjoy working with your hands in some form? Describe your activity? I don #8217;t think I #8217;m coordinated because, well, I was born that way (by which I mean having low muscle tone and hyperflexible joints). Because of that, I don #8217;t really work with my hands all that often though I like to think I #8217;d like stuff like drawing and engineering if I knew I wouldn #8217;t suck at it.  #8226; Are you artistic? If yes, describe your art? If you are not particular artistic but can appreciate art please likewise describe what forums of art you enjoy. Please explain your answer. I consider myself very artistic, I just don #8217;t make visual art. I #8217;m a singer (albeit not a professional one) and it #8217;s a life goal of mine to get fiction written and out to the masses in every form, y #8217;know, at least one novel, at least one picture book, at least one poetry book, at least one TV show, at least one movie, at least one stage production etc. In terms of a description of my art, my music is basically folk-pop with often very nerdy lyrics (if you #8217;ve heard of Jonathan Coulton, imagine if someone like Ed Sheeran covered one of his songs to get the  #8220;male equivalent #8221; of my music), my picture books are mostly nonfiction trying to get often-scientific concepts into kids #8217; heads through the power of rhyming verse, most of my movies are animated musicals of the sort Disney would jump at the chance to make (I #8217;m just not sure if I want to pitch them there), my TV shows mostly tend to fall into either the high school drama or  #8220;they fight crime #8221; trope categories although there #8217;s pretty much always a female lead (even if it #8217;s lead-among-an-ensemble) and some kind of fantasy or sci-fi  #8220;gimmick #8221; (like some kind of BNHA-esque high school for metahumans or a police procedural that just happens to be set in an urban fantasy world).  #8226; What's your opinion about the past, present, and future? How do you deal with them? The past: often still weighs heavily on my mind, I wish I could change it (in the sense of actually go back in time and do so without paradoxes) a lot more desperately so than most people do. The present: I try to pay attention to it but I #8217;m not really present in the present as a given in any sense other than the most basic The future: is usually where my focus lies be it plans, how my actions might affect others/the world or just plain ambitions.  #8226; How do you act when others request your help to do something (anything)? If you would decide to help them, why would you do so? I help them if I #8217;m not already busy with something more pressing and it #8217;s something I can actually help them with.  #8226; Do you need logical consistency in your life? Yes, at least to some degree, even if it #8217;s not what does so to everyone else, things do have to make sense to me.  #8226; How important is efficiency and productivity to you? I want it to happen a lot of the time (at least when it doesn #8217;t sacrifice quality/originality/authenticity etc.) but thanks to my executive dysfunction the efficiency and productivity I want out of me doesn #8217;t always end up materializing.  #8226; Do you control others, even if indirectly? How and why do you do that? I often do that, even without realizing it, when I feel like something isn #8217;t going to go the way I #8217;d rather it go otherwise. My main tactics when I try and manipulate or control others to see my point of view are emotional appeals, quid pro quo or more psychological subtle tactics (like sounding more distraught than I am or trying to subliminally assert my honesty by holding my hands palms-up as I ask)  #8226; What are your hobbies? Why do you like them? I love reading fiction and listening to music for a lot of the same reasons, getting caught up in someone else #8217;s story and feelings (hence why I like show tunes/narrative songs so much). I love gaming for different reasons depending on the type of game, if it #8217;s something like Hearthstone or Overwatch I tend to get real competitive because I want to, like, be  #8220;eSports level good #8221; but if it #8217;s something more story-based like [whatever the latest Pokemon game is] it #8217;s another case of getting caught up in the story like I do with all fiction I like. I like to write because creating my own story and world is a combination of both my loves of control and expression. I like to go thrift shopping/local-shopping (as in not shopping at big chains or mall stores or whatever) because it feels much more like an adventure in the selection process.  #8226; What is your learning style? What kind of learning environments do you struggle with most? Why do you like/struggle with these learning styles? Do you prefer classes involving memorization, logic, creativity, or your physical senses? I learn best at my own pace and with requirements for assignments etc. that hit the goldilocks zone of being broad enough to allow me creativity and specific enough so that I #8217;m not completely lost. I #8217;m not that good at practical/lab-related classes and tend to favor more academic-y  #8220;traditional #8221; ones (perhaps what drew me to the humanities in college instead of the sciences). I don #8217;t like things like science labs not just because I #8217;m not good at them but because they seem to require precision and detail-orientation that can somehow evade me in the practical sense but I can get the equivalent of in something like a literature discussion.  #8226; How good are you at strategizing? Do you easily break up projects into manageable tasks? Or do you have a tendency to wing projects and improvise as you go? I like to try and break things up into manageable tasks and often manage to do it when I care about what I #8217;m doing, however, often, with school assignments, no matter how much I care my executive function still ends up spazzing out and I end up doing them at the last minute no matter how much I plan.  #8226; What are your aspirations in life, professionally and personally? If professional means career, I don #8217;t really know what I want to do other than be a fiction writer but I know I want to do something on top of that. As for what I want out of a job, that can be best expressed through the fact that my dream fictional job would be working at some place like the Warehouse from Warehouse 13 or the Library from The Librarians. What those have that I #8217;d want in a more realistic job would be a close-knit community of kindred spirits and an opportunity to help/save people using my vast array of humanities knowledge.  #8226; What are your fears? What makes you uncomfortable? What do you hate? Why? Fears: My  #8220;conventional #8221; fears (if those help) are heights, Bugs Of Unusual Size, needles, and the can #8217;t-see-your-hand-in-front-of-your-face dark. My more abstract fears are of being controlled, that the world is far worse than I think it is and I #8217;m too brainwashed to see it, not just dying but basically  #8220;dying as if I never lived #8221; having left no lasting legacy behind for people to remember me and having all my family and friends predecease me so no one remembers me after I #8217;m gone on a personal level either, and being a bad person but not in the  #8220;cool badass villain #8221; kind of way. Things That Make Me Uncomfortable: Oversimplifications (not just in people #8217;s explanations but e.g. those  #8220;every [TV show] episode ever #8221; or  #8220;every [band] song ever #8221; posts with really stereotypical dialogue or lyrics, my own intrusive thoughts about how the shows I #8217;m watching are just pixels on a screen/actors on a set, and even stage directions like [laughs] or [sad music plays] or [loud noise] in the closed captioning of a video (I #8217;m fine with them in scripts)) because I feel like they #8217;re somehow missing the point/talking down to me and anything really cutesy/cheery in a childish sense (not in the sense of childish things at all, but in the sense of e.g. teenagers using cutesy baby talk online or really saccharine upbeat kids #8217; music). Also, a thing that makes me uncomfortable unconnected to those two connected ones is the fear (but not a strong enough one to go in the fear section) that new installments of various fandoms I #8217;m in will change *everything* in a way I don #8217;t like e.g. if the  #8220;fandom people #8221; writing Homestuck^2 will abide so strictly by Extended Zodiac rules that they #8217;ll overturn a lot of currently accepted classpect fanon or if  #8220;Overwatch 2 #8221; (whatever its actual name ends up being if not that) will change core aspects of gameplay moreso than just adding a PvE mode and/or the added story it adds will overturn a lot of what fans had accepted as canon about that universe. Things I Hate: Injustice, really loud/bassy music, rules that are either too strict for wiggle room or too vague to know what I #8217;m supposed to do, and 99% of everything made for the lowest common denominator  #8226; What do the "highs" in your life look like? Upbeat, chatty, motivated to work on basically every unfinished project I have regardless of if I finish them during said highs, ready to hang out with friends  #8226; What do the "lows" in your life look like? Scared of everything (in the abstract stuff sense not the physical one), angry at the world (but showing it through crying instead of raging out), overestimating the severity/magnitude of whatever caused the low and what lows it might lead my life to (e.g. thinking a bad grade is going to spiral down to getting kicked out of school spiraling down to having to live on the street and do things I #8217;d rather not say in polite company to survive)  #8226; How attached are you to reality? Do you daydream often, or do you pay attention to what's around you? If you do daydream, are you aware of your surroundings while you do so? I daydream very often and I #8217;m only aware of my surroundings in more than the barest sense while I #8217;m doing so if something happens in them to snap me out of it.  #8226; Imagine you are alone in a blank, empty room. There is nothing for you to do and no one to talk to. What do you think about? What the hell I #8217;m doing here, how the hell I get out and (briefly) the likelihood of, given the sci-fi-mindfuckiness of this scenario, getting out somehow metaphorically or literally throwing me into an indie puzzle game.  #8226; How long do you take to make an important decision? And do you change your mind once you've made it? It takes long enough for me to weigh out every potential pro and con but I don #8217;t usually change my mind.  #8226; How long do you take to process your emotions? How important are emotions in your life? Negative emotions take me the longest to process because I #8217;m usually too caught up in meltdown mode to see them for what they are until it #8217;s over. Emotions are also very important in my life but not the most important thing.  #8226; Do you ever catch yourself agreeing with others just to appease them and keep the conversation going? How often? Why? I don #8217;t really think I do, at least outside of school assignments (as since I take online classes online discussion is a requirement to replace class discussion) where I have to respond to someone no matter what. If anything, I #8217;m more the one on the other side of the conversation doing all the talking while other people are often (as best as my autism can read their emotions/minds) like  #8220;just smile and nod, smile and nod #8221;.  #8226; Do you break rules often? Do you think authority should be challenged, or that they know better? If you do break rules, why? I break the rules I disagree with and/or see no/bad reasons for the existence of. I would say I think authority should be challenged when you disagree with it but that makes it sound to my literal mind like that #8217;d goad the opposite political side to mine (not going to say which one I am) into trying to challenge the authority of my side when they #8217;re in power but then I feel like not allowing them to do that makes me as dictatorial as some of the extremists on my side accuse them of being.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>It's just a common thread I couldn't help noticing in the perennial desires; like open-world, challenge, a competitive rival, Pokemon following you out of the ball, visiting multiple-if-not-all regions in the same game etc. Even the freak-out over Dexit was over not being able to "catch em all". You get the idea, people aren't satisfied because they're not truly getting the kind of hero's journey they think they should and probably wouldn't unless they had not only a FIVR game but one that conforms to their desires via mind-reading and e.g. doesn't have and "worldbuilds out of the world" any Pokemon they've ever criticized, mechanic they've ever trashed or story element that ever rubbed them the wrong way and makes them and their strongest (in terms of attraction) "waifu" the same age with her willing to form a relationship with them and they also have Ash-like "protag plot armor"</TEXT>

    <TEXT>* Because I am an Aspie dumb-tush who's so afraid of spoilers she doesn't read/watch entire things like this, I legitimately thought (and posted several social media posts as if) OW2 came out on the 1st with Sojourn as the new hero * Overwatch needs to bite the bullet and add an actual African-*American* hero to the roster as, with the confirmation of Sojourn coming out sometime I thought was today, we've got an African hero, an Afro-Caribbean hero, and now an Afro-Canadian hero but no black hero actually from America. * Assuming the same event schedule (-Archives unless it's just "flashback episodes"), I think that future Summer Games events should change "theme" every time the Summer Games changes as long as there's a hero from the country the games are being held in and that hero should get (though the past ones like Lucioball would return) an Olympics-y event gamemode e.g. spotlighting Hanzo and Genji in 2020, Widowmaker in 2024 and some combination of McCree, Reaper and/or Ashe in 2028 * If they ever do any more "surprise lore dump diversity reveals" like happened with the "coming out" of Tracer and Soldier 76, it should either be confirmation of a same-sex "Battle Couple" between two heroes on the roster (because if loved-one-killing-loved-one in PvP was a problem for them, they wouldn't have added Ana and Brigitte to the roster) or (to veer completely away from sexuality) that D.va is on the autism spectrum. I'm not just saying this because I'm an autistic big D.va fan but the pieces are there if you know where to look (and how different the symptoms of even high-functioning autism can be) and don't just let the stereotype of characters like Symmetra guide your perception of what "functional" autism is like (not shitting on her as a character, it's just her character archetype is the sort canon autistic adult representation kinda gets tossed into by default and not all autistic adults are like that, and those outliers (like myself) would appreciate it if there was also a more different autistic on the roster) * Unless she was necessary for balance reasons or for the lore in the McCree short at that particular time, Ashe shouldn't have been released when she was and they should have held off on another DPS until tanks and supports are more even with that (either that or split the DPS into two categories that isn't just defense and offense again and then not have done 2-2-2) * Not quite an Overwatch opinion but a Blizzard opinion; while I agree the whole Blitzchung thing was kind of a shit move, I don't think it makes Blizzard the kind of fascist bootlicker scumbags everyone was saying they are. They just wanted to iirc keep politics restricted to the official PR channels (and no that doesn't mean some streamer should try and "test them" by expressing radical pro-China opinions) and now people are so us-vs-them-mindset that they think "oh, they criticized someone criticizing China, they must be on China's side which means they must support everything China's doing". * I think the roster needs at least one Jewish hero (at least one new one, but I also think unless anything about the lore revealed so far Josses this headcanon (and no, her Christmas skin doesn't as it's a Nutcracker character that has on multiple professional occasions and who-knows-how-many local ones been danced by a Jewish ballerina), they should make Mercy Jewish, I mean she does have a very Jewish last name that has already been held by a canonically Jewish character from another work of fiction (Toby on The West Wing) and more than one tradition has angels). And also if we got Jewish!Mercy and canon!Pharmercy, talk about symbolism. And if we get a new Jewish hero (as opposed to just her), it'd be really cool for them to be from Israel and come with a map that's, like, future!Tel Aviv (because Jerusalem at this moment is too much of a political football) or something because, if I remember the lore correctly, while not exactly peaceful altogether, the Middle East in that universe at least isn't plagued with the same kind of strife it is today and it'd be interesting to see how Israel reacted to being out of everyone's crosshairs. However, the other reason than just representation I want multiple Jews on the roster is because I had the cutest idea for a Chanukah skin for Hammond/Wrecking Ball (his ball becomes a dreidel, he's wearing a kippah and his mines are basically "exploding gelt") but this skin couldn't be made until we had at least one Jewish hero because I don't want to make fans think "they wasted the Jewish rep on a hamster". * If D.va truly has no connection to StarCraft like that one tweet claimed (and if she has, they should exploit the heck out of that), Blizzard should make up for that by having their next new IP be Mecha Guardian or whatever that game was that the blurb for Academy D.va said she played (as, even if they're the ones who made it in-universe, it makes sense that it wouldn't be in Blizzard World as even before Disney started buying up everything, they didn't represent all their properties at their parks) * Although I know it doesn't mean those locations disappeared off the face of that Earth, I don't get why they'd outright remove maps unless they were super duper buggy or whatever (which I could get with Paris but I didn't think Horizon had that kind of problem) because even if new heroes were going to have abilities that'd make them metaphorically broken on those maps, just advise people not to play them there * I disagree with people's idea that Doomfist should have been a tank, but I still think we need another Talon tank (and another Talon healer since you can't rely on someone always having the Baptiste skin) since if we want to do thematic 2-2-2s before they start doing "skin theme comps" like LoL they should start with the canon factions * If they add any Overwatch characters into Smash, they should add multiple ones (because hey, if Fire Emblem can have that much representation) just not Genji (because I think we've hit diminishing returns on anime sword boys) and not just other obvious picks like Tracer, D.va or Doomfist but perhaps a more unconventional pick like Ashe or Junkrat</TEXT>

    <TITLE>Help me find a song for a local talent show</TITLE>
    <DATE>2019-11-10 23:04:49</DATE>
    <TEXT>So it's been a bit of a tradition of mine to do a show tune at the community adult talent show (y'know, [my home city]'s Got Talent or something like that) however I'm kinda stuck for material this year and was hoping I could get some help Here are my requirements * It must be a solo * It must fit within my range which is mezzo-soprano or more specifically A3-A5 * It must be from an "indie" musical (as in not something popular enough someone else would probably "steal my song" like Wicked, Guys And Dolls, any Disney production, The Sound Of Music etc.); some shows I previously did songs from as examples of what I mean by indie are [title of show], 35MM and Ordinary Days. I want to show them something they've never heard before not just the billionth attempt at some Broadway classic. * It must be something believable for a twentysomething to sing aka why I'm not doing In The Bedroom Down The Hall (which otherwise would fit my indie requirement despite being from Dear Evan Hansen because it was a cut song "resurrected" by the deluxe edition of the soundtrack) because I look too young to be a mom</TEXT>

    <TEXT>**What age range are you in?** 23 and a half, female **Any disorders or conditions we should know about?** Officially-diagnosed autism, unofficially-diagnosed ADD and self-diagnosed BPD **What were you like as a kid?** (If we #8217;re talking actual prepubescent subject4975 and not just  #8220;when I was a youth #8221;) Despite having very few close kid friends outside my Girl Scout troop, I was the sort of kid who #8217;d blab about whatever #8217;s on her mind (be it actual thoughtful stuff or hobbies I wanted to try/things I wanted to be when I grew up for no other reason than  #8220;I saw someone do this in a game I play or show I watch and it looked cool #8221;) to any adult patient enough to listen. When not doing that (and not occupied with classwork or homework) I would pretty much always be either reading and/or watching some PBSKids show. On the playground etc. I #8217;d either just go on the merry-go-round or indulge in some weird pretend game (like trying to make a fire by rubbing twigs alone and pretending I was camping). I even created imaginary friends for the express purpose of saying I had one because  #8220;kids I read about and watched on TV had them #8221;. **Describe your relationship with your parents.** I get along pretty well with my dad (who I think is INTJ 5w6) because we #8217;re both the sort of nerd/geek combo who can talk for hours about everything from what subjects are lumpable under the umbrella of  #8220;art #8221; to which currently-popular actors could play the various Green Lanterns of Earth if they ever made a Green Lantern TV show. However, the things I don #8217;t like about him are that I can #8217;t tell if he #8217;s joking or not, he has fantasies he knows he #8217;ll never be able to make come true (but still has anyway) about murdering (often via a method involving explosions or fire) any non-related-to-him people who piss him off, he #8217;s a die-hard misanthrope (but even then still cares more than he cares to admit) and (unstereotypically for his type combo) his train of thought leapfrogs all over the damn place sometimes off nothing more than a linguistic pun or sound-alike word and I can #8217;t keep up. Mom (ESFJ 2w1) is the one I #8217;ve distanced myself a little more from (though we still do have common interests ranging from politics to family trees to oldies to Star Trek) and I #8217;m not sure if that #8217;s the cause of or the effect of me seeing her as more of the  #8220;disciplinarian parent who deals out the harsh punishments #8221;. **What do you hope to avoid doing or being? What values are important to you?** Although I understand the kind of things I want to do with my life/ways I want to take action may lead me to be the antagonist in a lot of people #8217;s stories, I #8217;m trope-aware enough to see the difference between antagonist and villain so I can try and avoid being the latter when I think I #8217;m only being the former. That #8217;s the reason why a lot of fictional antagonists garner my sympathy up until some breaking point where they #8217;re  #8220;too evil for me #8221;, because that #8217;s when they #8217;re acting like too much of a out-and-out bad guy to be relatable as their actions have slipped out of the  #8220;things I #8217;d do in their situation #8221; category. I also want to avoid being  #8220;normal #8221; so much that I was afraid (once I read about how certain personality traits might be influenced by autism) any treatment for my autism would take so much else out of me that I #8217;d end up some Lawful Good  #8220;basic bitch #8221; whose music tastes are literally whatever #8217;s on the Billboard Hot 100 (hating a song once it falls off) and if she were involved in nerd culture at all would sort herself into Gryffindor Harry-Potter-wise because  #8220;that #8217;s where the good guys are #8221;. The values that are important to me are intelligence (if that counts), optimism/idealism, passion (or whatever #8217;s the opposite of apathy) and creativity. **Aside from phobias, are there any fears that characterised your childhood? Have they continued into the present day, or not, and if not, how have you dealt with them?** A lot of the fears I had as a child (which pretty much all have continued into adulthood) were related to (but not entirely because of) me getting into dystopian sci-fi like The Giver and The Bar Code Tattoo; a fear of being controlled by some outside force, a fear of the world being much worse than I think it is and me not being  #8220;woke #8221; (in the truest sense) enough to see it/take action, a fear of being a (to use a newer term with slightly bad connotations)  #8220;normie #8221; no matter how much I wanted the kind of connection that came from fitting in, and a fear of insignificance. Yeah I was a precocious little Aspie kid. **How do you see yourself?** The awkward outsider; someone who wants to change stuff (be it a world issue or just a local practice) but never gets the attention she deserves for her ideas and who can seemingly never keep more than one good friend (and often wonders if she deliberately subconsciously pushes away potential ones to cultivate the whole  #8220;eccentric nerdy loner #8221; image). **How do you want others to see you?** On the one hand I want them to see me as smart, capable and responsible (especially if they #8217;re in a position of authority over me and might get  #8220;fooled #8221; by my executive dysfunction), on the other hand I want them to see me as quirky, passionate, creative and inspiring. **What do you dislike the most in other people?** (Other than what should imho be the obvious answer of bigots and assholes) I dislike apathetic and/or cynical people, people who don #8217;t pull their weight when we work together, people who demand so much of me it #8217;s overwhelming, and people who seem to care only for lowest-common-denominator things (e.g. the types of people who get *really* into football or someone who willingly watches Keeping Up With The Kardashians but dismisses even critically-acclaimed geeky media like Cosmos or Star Trek: TNG as  #8220;for nerds #8221; without even being willing to watch an episode) **Which habit do you most automatically act on? Rank the following habits from most to least automatic, on a scale of 1 (most) to 3 (least).** **a.) Work for personal gain with more concern for self than for others.** 3) Depends on what you mean by work as under some definitions I have done that quite a bit but not as much as the others. **b.) Strive for a sense of tranquillity in yourself and the world around you.** 2) Sometimes this can get conflated with the one in c) because often I feel like I have to assert myself to metaphorically or literally demand what would make things peaceful. **c.) Decide what is right for the betterment of something or someone else.** 1) I have these ideas in my head of the way things should be and I want to do whatever it takes to try and make them happen even if I couldn #8217;t practically make them happen as only me (the most extreme case being when I came up with this complicated scheme (that I knew I couldn #8217;t pull off without a lot more resources or allies, especially in less than a year) to try and get a favorite show set in my hometown to actually film its next season actually in my hometown instead of LA all because my mom has complained on several occasions that the trees, mountains etc. were all wrong and if it #8217;s wrong, I want to make it right). Only problem other than lacking resources is my poor theory of mind doesn #8217;t always pick up on how what I think would benefit a person and what they think would are not always the same. **Where does the wandering mind take you? What provokes this?** Often when I #8217;m just alone with my thoughts (like when I #8217;m in an understimulating environment or whatever), I make up stories just so my mind can actually be doing *something* (often fanfiction based on something I recently read or watched). **What makes you feel your best? What makes you feel your worst?** My best: When I #8217;m doing something I love and/or being with someone I love, when I feel like I have control over a situation, or when I #8217;m part of something bigger (be it prepping for some holiday my town goes all out for or attending a protest etc.) My worst: Being in an environment with either too much or too little stimulation, rules that are either too specific for me to have creative freedom or too vague for me to know what the hell I #8217;m supposed to do, and feeling like I #8217;m not being taken seriously. **Let's talk about emotions. Explain what might make you feel the following, how they feel to you or how you react to the emotion:** **a) anger** I don #8217;t really get angry proper, it #8217;s just when something goes the way I don #8217;t want it or people are suffering somewhere, I either break down crying or just get this sense of righteous frustration of  #8220;why isn #8217;t anyone changing these circumstances and what can I do to do so #8221;. **b) shame** Shame also kinda triggers an autistic meltdown, this time when I feel like I screwed something up big time and usually said meltdown involves completely feeling useless and like everything I do might as well get equally screwed up. **c) anxiety** Overthinking, intrusive thoughts, and maybe a little crying **Describe how you respond to the following:** **a) stress** Either the meltdowns again (as the situations that cause anger and shame are also stressful) and/or trying to  #8220;run for cover #8221; if e.g. people are fighting near me or whatever. **b) negative unexpected change** I want to change it back, no matter how unrealistic and convoluted the potential way I think of might be. **c) conflict** The aforementioned stress reaction (when it #8217;s particularly heated) where I just get the hell out of wherever the conflict is occurring not caring if the people yelling I #8217;m trying to get away from think I #8217;m rude. **What kind of role are you naturally inclined to take in a group? Why?** As close to leader as I can get because I #8217;m usually the one with all the ideas and I want to make sure they #8217;re followed through on or I feel underappreciated. **If put in power, how do you behave? Why?** I try to be good but sometimes I can #8217;t help myself from being a little manipulative or  #8220;throwing my position at #8221; people who are disrespectful because I need to make sure whatever I #8217;m leading has some semblance of cohesion. **Do you tend to struggle with others who have authority over you? Why?** I struggle with them if I don #8217;t agree with them or I don #8217;t see the reasoning for the rules etc. they impose. **What do you see or notice in others that most people don't?** I #8217;m not always that good with noticing stuff about people because of my autism but I do see a lot of potential in their ideas when others might not. **Comment on your relationship with trust.** I usually trust people on a  #8220;micro-level #8221; (as in people I actually know) unless they #8217;ve previously been shown to antagonize me but on a  #8220;macro-level #8221; (be it strangers or politicians not quite on my side) I #8217;m a little bit wary always. **Briefly: What religious and/or political beliefs do you have? Do you think they influenced your responses in this questionnaire?** I #8217;m a Jew, a pseudo-armchair Wiccan (only due to lack of supplies in my damn town) and a pretty firm progressive, but I don #8217;t think those influenced my responses any more than they do my life normally. **Which temptations do you find yourself acting upon the most? (And briefly state why)?** Tempted to slack off because of my ADD, my mind is basically working on multiple tracks at once. **List some of the traits you: a) like; b) dislike most about yourself.** a) Creativity, cunning, passion, idealism, intelligence, imagination b) Social awkwardness, executive dysfunction, lack of emotional regulation, anxiety (a bit of a self-reinforcing loop there), over-deliberation **If a stranger insults you, how do you respond/feel? What if they compliment you?** My reaction to an insult would vary from ignoring it and moving on to flat-out telling an authority figure depending on what they said. If they complimented me, I #8217;d probably just say thank you and (unless they #8217;re in a position to talk to me further) move on with my life unless they sounded like they had inappropriate intentions. **What's something you are: a.) thankful you have. b.) wish you could have? Why?** a) An actually supportive family for all of my weirdness because pop culture has  #8220;taught #8221; me to expect things like e.g. a negative reaction (albeit not necessarily disowning) when I came out as queer. b) A stable ensemble of friends/as close as someone non-fiction can have to True Companions because I #8217;ve never really had that kind of closeness consistently in my life So am I an INTP, 4w5, both or neither?</TEXT>

    <DATE>2019-11-13 00:22:03</DATE>
    <TEXT>When I posted the following response to a questionnaire on r/Enneagram, I got a lot of responses regarding what my Enneagram might be but because I said I have three different neurodiversities, some people said MBTI might not be very accurate/might not apply and all I want is an actual answer.

What makes you feel your worst?** My best: When I #8217;m doing something I love and/or being with someone I love, when I feel like I have control over a situation, or when I #8217;m part of something bigger (be it prepping for some holiday my town goes all out for or attending a protest etc.) My worst: Being in an environment with either too much or too little stimulation, rules that are either too specific for me to have creative freedom or too vague for me to know what the hell I #8217;m supposed to do, and feeling like I #8217;m not being taken seriously. **Let's talk about emotions. Explain what might make you feel the following, how they feel to you or how you react to the emotion:** **a) anger** I don #8217;t really get angry proper, it #8217;s just when something goes the way I don #8217;t want it or people are suffering somewhere, I either break down crying or just get this sense of righteous frustration of  #8220;why isn #8217;t anyone changing these circumstances and what can I do to do so #8221;. **b) shame** Shame also kinda triggers an autistic meltdown, this time when I feel like I screwed something up big time and usually said meltdown involves completely feeling useless and like everything I do might as well get equally screwed up. **c) anxiety** Overthinking, intrusive thoughts, and maybe a little crying **Describe how you respond to the following:** **a) stress** Either the meltdowns again (as the situations that cause anger and shame are also stressful) and/or trying to  #8220;run for cover #8221; if e.g. people are fighting near me or whatever. **b) negative unexpected change** I want to change it back, no matter how unrealistic and convoluted the potential way I think of might be. **c) conflict** The aforementioned stress reaction (when it #8217;s particularly heated) where I just get the hell out of wherever the conflict is occurring not caring if the people yelling I #8217;m trying to get away from think I #8217;m rude. **What kind of role are you naturally inclined to take in a group? Why?** As close to leader as I can get because I #8217;m usually the one with all the ideas and I want to make sure they #8217;re followed through on or I feel underappreciated. **If put in power, how do you behave? Why?** I try to be good but sometimes I can #8217;t help myself from being a little manipulative or  #8220;throwing my position at #8221; people who are disrespectful because I need to make sure whatever I #8217;m leading has some semblance of cohesion. **Do you tend to struggle with others who have authority over you? Why?** I struggle with them if I don #8217;t agree with them or I don #8217;t see the reasoning for the rules etc. they impose. **What do you see or notice in others that most people don't?** I #8217;m not always that good with noticing stuff about people because of my autism but I do see a lot of potential in their ideas when others might not. **Comment on your relationship with trust.** I usually trust people on a  #8220;micro-level #8221; (as in people I actually know) unless they #8217;ve previously been shown to antagonize me but on a  #8220;macro-level #8221; (be it strangers or politicians not quite on my side) I #8217;m a little bit wary always. **Briefly: What religious and/or political beliefs do you have? Do you think they influenced your responses in this questionnaire?** I #8217;m a Jew, a pseudo-armchair Wiccan (only due to lack of supplies in my damn town) and a pretty firm progressive, but I don #8217;t think those influenced my responses any more than they do my life normally. **Which temptations do you find yourself acting upon the most? (And briefly state why)?** Tempted to slack off because of my ADD, my mind is basically working on multiple tracks at once. **List some of the traits you: a) like; b) dislike most about yourself.** a) Creativity, cunning, passion, idealism, intelligence, imagination b) Social awkwardness, executive dysfunction, lack of emotional regulation, anxiety (a bit of a self-reinforcing loop there), over-deliberation **If a stranger insults you, how do you respond/feel? What if they compliment you?** My reaction to an insult would vary from ignoring it and moving on to flat-out telling an authority figure depending on what they said. If they complimented me, I #8217;d probably just say thank you and (unless they #8217;re in a position to talk to me further) move on with my life unless they sounded like they had inappropriate intentions. **What's something you are: a.) thankful you have. b.) wish you could have? Why?** a) An actually supportive family for all of my weirdness because pop culture has  #8220;taught #8221; me to expect things like e.g. a negative reaction (albeit not necessarily disowning) when I came out as queer. b) A stable ensemble of friends/as close as someone non-fiction can have to True Companions because I #8217;ve never really had that kind of closeness consistently in my life So am I an INTP, 4w5, both or neither?</TEXT>

    <TEXT>That's why I was baffled when, in passing, one of my parents referred to the first Michael Bay Transformers movie as a B-movie because I thought that B-movies were a specific kind of movie; often-black-and-white movies made in the 50s/60s/70s that were mostly sci-fi or "science fantasy" but often straight-up urban or Gothic fantasy, likely to have elements like ordinary animals somehow grown to giant size and turned hostile or hot alien chicks in as little clothing as was acceptable to show in non-erotic movies of that time period or a vampire or evil sorcerer (in a fantasy movie) or vaguely-Eastern-European mad scientist with crazy Einstein hair (in a sci-fi one) with a *really* bad accent, but nearly-always had pretty much the "platonic ideal gender stereotype" lead couple where the guy was a badass and the girl usually gets captured (and seduced if he's humanoid enough) by the villain and if she helps save the day at all it's through common sense or empathy. Basically, think the kind of stuff movies like The Rocky Horror Picture Show were sending up</TEXT>

    <DATE>2019-11-25 00:18:55</DATE>
    <TEXT>I know there would be some issues that'd come with that (like how to tie into the whole "Southwestern Gothic" feel I'd want this to have without seeming like it's "using Native American culture to make it spooky" and if having Native American side characters (even if they're portrayed respectfully and heroically) with a white protagonist is racist) but I just kinda think this would be a neat idea for Disney to do for two reasons. Reason #1: If they ever return to America as a setting for their animated musicals like with The Princess And The Frog and some of the animal ones, there's so much "American folklore" they could explore (even stuff that isn't racist). Reason #2: I've been getting into a lot of country/bluegrass-sounding Broadway shows lately (with some favorite songs including [Whoa, Mama](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2mAmv10XWw4) and [He Wanted A Girl](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IvnW9LKBFFQ)) and (though I'm not sure if bluegrass proper would be appropriate for a Wild West story) I think it'd be cool if a Disney musical had that kind of sound</TEXT>

    <DATE>2019-11-28 02:29:22</DATE>
    <TEXT>I can't imagine it was because of Dexit or they would have said something but did anyone notice that after a while the trailers just kinda dropped off? I mean for Pete's sake (be it legit or "controlled") we found out about most of the new Pokemon in the Dex through a goshdang strategy guide leak and the story was basically a complete curveball barely even hinted at. For comparison, look at something like Sun and Moon. I'm not saying those games gave us everything in the trailers but they at least gave us more to go on, like an average of about 4-6 Pokemon per trailer and enough at least story hints for us to form a complete idea that ended up being wrong about the game's plot (that whole thing with Ultra Beasts being shifters with a human form and Pokemon-like form and the story being a metaphor for immigration and assimilation-or-not). Game Freak, Nintendo, whoever's the right company to talk to, if you don't want the game feeling lackluster or people making up a bunch of fake leaks (or leaking a bunch of real shit), give us more before the goddamn game is released next time!</TEXT>

    <TITLE>[Spoiler] Frozen 2's revelations don't contradict the themes of the first movie but do kind of underscore its neurodivergent-coding/subtext for Elsa</TITLE>
    <DATE>2019-11-29 02:05:08</DATE>
    <TEXT>This opinion was developed after I saw a beautiful-but-that's-beside-the-point picture on Deviantart someone had made with a dollmaker of Anna having fall powers to go with Elsa's winter powers because when they saw Frozen 2 and learned the secret that  gt;!Elsa isn't completely human albeit not completely not, although the kind of not-human she is isn't quite deserving of the label of "goddess" the artist kind of derisively used! lt;, they felt that that revelation shot the first movie's theme of equality between the sisters in the foot unless Anna had powers too (whether or not they made her what Elsa is). However, that's completely misunderstanding the point of the first movie as just because the two sisters reconciled doesn't mean they had achieved equality and, some might argue that what Anna was proposing in the climax of the first movie (especially in the deleted song "Life's Too Short" that was replaced by the reprise of "For The First Time In Forever") was equality negatively portrayed, for Elsa to put the damn gloves back on and return both lives and land to normal (equality meaning Elsa couldn't be herself). That's where the neurodivergency part (any fan of the first movie should know how heavily that laid it on) comes back in because, although Elsa's true nature doesn't mean neurodivergent people have to either reject the coding or accept that the negative connotations of that apply to them too (especially because we don't live in that universe), it also means that while Elsa and Anna will never truly be equals in the way the artist was probably thinking, they both have talents worth appreciating in their own rights and as an awesome team. Hopefully if there is the Frozen 3 people claimed Frozen 2 was setting things up too easily for, it won't repeat the first two movies' formula of the major conflict being "Elsa makes a bad decision and Anna has to bail her out saving both her life and Arendelle" and would feature both sisters keeping up the bridge over the gap between them (as "closing the gap" not equality is the theme of Frozen regarding their relationship and echoed a lot in Frozen 2) to use their diverse skills in concert to take out an external threat proper.</TEXT>

    <DATE>2019-11-29 05:47:50</DATE>
    <TEXT>Look, as a fan of the story, the only thing hurting more than this news is the fan reaction. As the title says, just blanket boycotting a company out of spite because they did a thing you don't like didn't work for Dexit, why do you think it should work here (to keep with the Dexit analogy, I'm surprised nobody's tried to fake accusations to #MeToo MaRo yet). But I do see how you guys are so mad because, while I get that some of the queer people in the fandom thought Wizards could do better even before this, the way some of them talk about it the only thing that'd count as "walking the walk" is for each of the couples (including Gruulfriends who they'd fix) to get at least one "positive emotions spell" (a la Cathartic Reunion) with card art showing them either kissing or in-bed-in-a-SFW-way-implying-that-they-just-had-sex and flavor text referencing the love these two have for each other and all proceeds from those cards and only those cards to go to pro-LGBTQ+ charities and them to be legal in all formats for the metaphorical rest of forever. Anyway, mini-rant about people panicking aside, what can we the fans actually practically do to change their minds that would be more effective than a boycott (as there can't be nothing)?</TEXT>

    <TEXT>So I was perusing the musical writing sub and came across [this](https://soundcloud.com/user-645461855/spread-a-little-joy-around-the-place) gem on the thread about the animation challenge and that got me thinking, if Disney's willing to take the risk of adapting a non-musical movie into a stage musical (with songs that "aren't already hits" etc. even if it doesn't include the song I linked), Inside Out would make an awesome Broadway show. Good message, good gender balance of cast (in terms of matching the emotions' physicality, all you'd need to do despite their cartoonish proportions is cast (if possible) a plus-size girl as Sadness, a tall thin guy as Fear and a guy shorter than the rest of the actors playing the emotions as Anger), nice way for a child star to break out as Riley etc. Sure, it might be a little technically demanding but kid-oriented shows have been like that before like Seussical or Charlie And The Chocolate Factory and musicals have even done the "multiple "worlds" at once" thing you'd need to do to make the multiple settings work</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Based on my analysis of people's analysis of my enneagram questionnaire, I think (though that still might be subject to change) I'm a 6w7 4w3 1w9 and here are my pet peeves * Those kind of memes that were popular from when celebrities started dying in 2016 to the first few months of 2017 saying either that 2016 "broke the world"/that we died on 12/21/12 and this is hell/a simulation/a fever dream/the dark timeline or that we're living in some kind of fictional dystopia for realsies because [vague reasons having to do with Trump] like back when Beyonce was pregnant with boy-girl twins, there were literally people hoping for her to die in childbirth so her twins (reuniting after separation of many years) could take down his "regime" because apparently he was enough of a Palpatine and she's enough of a queen they thought Revenge Of The Sith was going to happen * Overly explicatory stuff; be it just descriptive (like social media posts saying "every [band] song" or "every [show] episode ever" with really stereotypical dialogue or lyrics etc. (and even in the case of the music posts, descriptions of their stereotypical sound in stage direction brackets) or (though I'm fine with reading them) descriptions of noises in stage direction brackets in video captions) or ones that kind of feel like commands to do the opposite because they're calling out those things as stereotypes even if said opposite would be socially inapropos (like two YouTube videos I saw [I want to be a YouTuber that's why they're relevant], one someone's Worst Songs Of 2019 list where he began by literally saying "Stoic face. Intro stinger. Self-deprecating joke" [as a joke about how most music critics on YouTube begin their worst list videos that just made me feel like I had to do the opposite even though showing exaggerated emotion or not having an intro on purpose would feel just as artificial] and one from the trailer cycle for Pokemon Sun And Moon where (albeit equally jokingly) somebody literally made a tutorial for reaction videos to a certain trailer for the game * (Also inspired by "year-end YouTube music list season" but not entirely having to do with that) when someone gives thorough and intellectual criticism showing why they don't like a thing I like I feel guilty for liking the thing because I feel like their logic is "too sound to be wrong" if you get my drift * When my parents told me to do chores I always had to wait a few minutes until they were distracted with something else because I didn't want to feel like I did that because they made me * In class assignments if requirements are too vague I don't know what I'm supposed to do but if they're too specific I can't be creative</TEXT>

    <DATE>2019-12-03 04:10:46</DATE>
    <TEXT>Because at least the first two have some correlation with personality (if there's any validity to the systems at all, the MBTI is supposed to represent your learning style and the Enneagram your worst fears/insecurities and how you overcome them) and the last one at least might be a way to convince people who wouldn't be swayed by value disagreements or logic that they shouldn't vote for a certain candidate by pointing out some "unfavorable aspect" in their chart or whatever. Also it would stop personality subs from being clogged up with "what are the candidates' MBTIs" etc. every presidential election and they wouldn't need to release their birth certificate if they release their birth chart as people good enough in astrology could just work it out backward from their sun/moon/rising to get their time and place of birth</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Saw @littledarkfairywitch on Tumblr post this meme and I thought this sub would find it cool **Aries** Sun: Ram horns regardless of gender, strong foreheads, and bones are stronger than average since they #8217;re prone to injury Moon: Pyrokinesis, quick self healing factor, or precognition Rising: Red and orange color scheme, hair often curly but can be any  #8220;natural #8221; color, eyes are either a warm red or a bright orange, most are average height or smaller **Taurus** Sun: Bull horns regardless of gender, large hands in proportion to their bodies, and stomachs and immune system allow them to eat anything without harm Moon: Super strength, stone manipulation, or can communicate with any mammal Rising: Brown and green color scheme, eyes could be either color, hair often thick and usually black, green, or brown, often either chubby or beefy physique (some more or less thick than others) **Gemini** Sun: Second set of arms, eyes can zoom in and out of long distant range, and have a much easier time learning other languages than others Moon: Super speed, can shapeshift into any human form, or physical duplication Rising: Color scheme is light blue and yellow, eyes can be either color, hair can be any  #8220;unnatural #8221; color, physique varies but they have long legs proportionate to their height **Cancer** Sun: Hands can morph into crab claws (color determined by rising), skin glitters when exposed to moonlight, all of them are empaths Moon: Lunar abilities ( produce and shoot lunar beams, control tides; however this can only be accessed at night), psychic absorption (can absorb and use one power at a time, this only tires the victim) , or producing force fields Rising: Silver and shades of blue color scheme, eyes can be either color and are very glossy, hair is either blue or black, tend to be short **Leo** Sun: Feline like canines, nails are long and strong like claws, skin glitters when exposed to sunlight Moon: Solar abilities (produce and shoot solar beams and control heat; this can only be accessed during the day), laser eyes, or sonic boom roar (explosive, can physically push away anything in its close range) Rising: Gold and red color scheme, eyes are often gold, hair almost always big no mater the length, can be any  #8220;natural #8221; color, either really tall or really short **Virgo** Sun: Large feathered wings (color determined by rising), they look human otherwise Moon: Portal creation, telekinesis, or poison manipulation Rising: color scheme is green and yellow, eyes can be either color, hair is either brown or black base with any second color, physique varies but all have longer than average fingers **Libra** Sun: Skin on the hands and forearms are metallic gold or silver, have glowing eyes (color determined by rising), can always tell if you #8217;re lying Moon: Plant manipulation, siren song, or sonic scream (not explosive but can stun any living being in its range and break close enough objects) Rising: Green and pink color scheme, eyes are either pink or yellow, hair is either white, brown, or pink, are often tall with wide hips regardless of gender **Scorpio** Sun: Fully functional scorpion tail (proportionate to their body), can easily see in the dark, very silent walkers who can sneak up on anyone Moon: Shadow manipulation, mediumship (includes the dead and powerful spirits), or selective mind reading (can #8217;t communicate mentally) Rising: Black and red color scheme, eyes are either dark blue or bright red, hair can be any dark color, can easily blend in with their surrounding **Sagittarius** Sun: Can switch from biped to centaur and back, keeps their tail in any form, hair grows long and fast Moon: Can shoot energy arrows or spears, light manipulation, or power jump (can leap as high as 50ft off the ground) Rising: Orange and brown color scheme, eyes can be either color, hair is red or dirty blond, often tall but short ones are faster runners **Capricorn** Sun: Goat horns legs and hooves, pretty much satyrs Moon: Ice manipulation, telepathy, or temporarily slow time Rising: Brown and black color scheme, eyes are any shade of brown, hair is black but can have any secondary color, often average height and have a very fit physique but that varies, they throw some of the hardest punches **Aquarius** Sun: Are the most human looking of the signs but they always have at least one robotic body enhancement, can retain more information than the others Moon: Electric manipulation, technopathy, or wind manipulation Rising: Electric blue and black, eyes are any shade of blue, hair can be any bright  #8220;unnatural #8221; color, often tall but body type varies **Pisces** Sun: Can switch from biped to mermaid and back (scale colors determined by rising), have a set of gills that closes on land, often have scales grown on stray parts of their body that shows even on land Moon: Water manipulation, aura manipulation, or invisibility Rising: Sea green and lavender color scheme, eyes can be either color, hair can be any shade of blue or purple, physique varies but they have large glossy eyes So since my S/M/R is Aries/Sagittarius/Sagittarius, I would have ram horns, strong bones and a strong forehead, light manipulation, energy arrows or spears or a power jump (if I had to pick one, I #8217;d go with the light manipulation as the second is just an application of it and leaping tall buildings in a single bound is not good for the acrophobic), and an orange and brown color scheme with orange eyes and dirty blonde hair and I #8217;d also be a fast runner because I #8217;m short What would you be?</TEXT>

    <DATE>2019-12-10 06:37:58</DATE>
    <TEXT>Saw this crop up on a post about how goblincore (apparently some kind of subculture/aesthetic-y thing on Tumblr) is anti-semitic because the traits of goblins it draws upon are drawn from anti-semitic stereotypes and I want to know if dwarves are as negative. I mean sure there's the gold thing but at least with the Tolkien dwarves, I thought they're portrayed rather complexly apart from that with other similar traits (like how the songs from the new Hobbits movies "sound Jewish" and how they're seeking to take their homeland back) and a lot of criticisms of their portrayal in The Hobbit are mainly potshots at Thorin Oakenshield, and him being a flawed character isn't anti-Semitic. And seeing as Pratchett's Discworld dwarves are also apparently very Jewish-coded (albeit I've read less Pratchett than I have Tolkien), I'm wondering if that archetype of the "fantasy Jewish" dwarf is okay or not</TEXT>

The best I can figure out is that Dorothy Ann is a Seer, Wanda's a Breath player (and not just because of her whole "Wildcat Wanda, ace pilot, queen of the clouds" thing in the flight episode), Tim's a Space player, and Phoebe's a Hope player (was debating between Hope and Life until I remembered how often part of the conflict of Phoebe-centric episodes is "Phoebe doesn't believe in herself in [situation x] and needs to learn how")</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I was trying to type one of my favorite shows (no need asking what, you've probably never heard of it though have fun guessing from the types I list) back when I first got into typology and, when I tested each character's MBTI and Enneagram individually then put them together, amidst combos you might expect like ISFJ 6w7 ENTP 7w8, and INFP 4w5 I got a few weird ones that didn't seem to go together which I'll list now ENTP 4w3 ESFJ 4w3 ISFP 8w9 INTP 8w9 INTP 7w6 And both my gut and several typology-nerd acquaintances of mine told me those types don't go together because of general incompatibilities in the kind of personality necessary or something like that; so do they or not and if they don't, what do you think someone who thinks they are those type combinations (as that's the best way I can frame the situation without infodumping show at you) would actually be?</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Pokemon Royal Black and Royal White Think about it, a lot of the parallels/plot-jumping-off-points people have noticed between both sets of games (BW and SwSh) *and* their region settings have revolved in some sense around royalty/medieval stuff. Also, there isn't much you can do with the symbolism in BW unlike ORAS as the legendaries represent truth and ideals and e.g. Pokemon Honest White sounds either racist or like a poorly-named branded toothpaste, and colors can often be preceded by the modifier "royal" like royal blue and royal purple</TEXT>

    <DATE>2019-12-20 04:34:10</DATE>
    <TEXT>I'm a screenwriter and as a fan of Harry Potter who is not a fan of the Discourse surrounding it, I hope to someday get the rights to adapt a comparable series that doesn't have as many problematic elements (potential stereotypes, stuff (including lack of certain diversities) that was a product of its time, publicly-expressed problematic views the author holds etc.) so I can help create a similar craze without similar backlash. However, the problem is, (especially because I hope to write the script adapting the first book first before asking for the rights from the author, to show my commitment to the project) I don't know what series to choose. I heard a rumor Percy Jackson is already getting a TV adaptation and the other series I like that seem in the same vein and age range as Harry Potter; Keeper Of The Lost Cities and Charlie Bone, have had some things fans have taken issue with diversity-wise that I'm worried making movies of them might bring front and center So what series can you think of that are similar to the ones I describe in tone, age range etc. but with diverse characters and less problematic elements</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Speaking as someone for whom the series held a great impact (e.g. Luna Lovegood and to a lesser extent (though I related to Luna more because I'm a girl) Arthur Weasley were the first examples I saw of characters-you-could-make-a-strong-case-for-being-autistic who weren't cold uptight STEM geniuses with near-perfect executive function, and also [if not for the events I'm about to mention and their potential to ruin it] I'd wish the [sortinghatchats system](https://ejadelomax.itch.io/sortinghatchats) was as well known as the MBTI or Enneagram test), I'm not sure how to react to the latest news. Part of me wants to give her the benefit of the doubt and hope that the supposed problem was blown out of proportion like was the case with Blizzard supposedly supporting China because I've always been one to play devil's advocate on her other controversies (e.g. there was subtextual support for Dumbledore's sexuality but Doylistically it was the 90s and Watsonianly he probably wasn't out of the closet at school out of fear "certain families" could fearmonger potential pedophilia accusations to get him and his "eccentric reputation" fired, in-universe the Ilvermorny house animals were extant magical creatures and if the founders were Native they'd have had to each come from the tribe the symbol of the house they founded came from and that kind of cooperation would have been no small feat even for wizards in the 18th century, lycanthropy was only compared to homosexuality/AIDS in Lupin's arc (because allegories don't have to work all the way or Zootopia is problematic no matter what) and people only attack her for the thing about how wizards poop because it's gross enough to make off-color jokes about). However part of me is worried about what to do if it's real. I mean people on Tumblr have said we shouldn't disown the fandom or claim we own it or that Miku made it now but I don't know what of what people say she did is actually either true or textually justified and even if somewhere out there is an alternate universe where the HP universe exists on its own, if it's still built on the things people claim she based on bigotry, then it's still problematic because it has bigotry even more baked into it than America. Also, sure I get how people want to go back in time and make her not write it/teach her the right way but my damn catastrophizing brain takes it even further and realizes in order to get the books published with the "changes" I'd want her to have made I'd have to go back further to teach tolerance to the "generation" that'd be accepting or rejecting them but I'd also need to teach it to their elders so it's ingrained in the industry or whatever and so on and so forth all the way back through human history until I end up feeling like the ultimate endgame is for some kind of FAGSLC hivemind society (as in that's the only way I could see to have both a perfect society and also them kind of be merged in one god-consciousness) where everyone's all races but white all genders but male all orientations but straight etc. to have always existed and then only then can we make and consume unproblematic fiction except we have no need to either because the way we'd be god would make us know all or because the aspect of us that'd still be a society would have so little conflict there's no room for plot (and then I worry that the establishment somehow wants people like me to think that so we think there's no workable way to enact change) TL;DR I don't know the full story and therefore if I have to give up everything related to Harry Potter (including the aforementioned sortingchats system despite my sorting having me freaking down) or somehow get her to change her views or what</TEXT>

    <TITLE>Your type and your top 10 favorite hit songs of 2019</TITLE>
    <DATE>2019-12-26 23:56:42</DATE>
    <TEXT>As an aspiring YouTube music critic, it kinda felt a little disheartening to see a lot of songs I grew to like in the first year I truly spent watching the charts get on the other critics' worst lists, but I have a theory that it might be due to their MBTI/personality type and how it differs from mine. That's why I'm asking any pop music nerds on here to look at the [year-end hot 100 for 2019](https://www.billboard.com/charts/year-end/2019/hot-100-songs) and list their top 10 favorite songs from it in order along with their MBTI and (if they know it) Enneagram As for me I'm an INFP 6w7 and these are my top 10 hits of 2019 1. [Beautiful People by Ed Sheeran ft. Khalid](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=74yb9E3WY1I) 2. [Circles by Post Malone](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQV0WEdT_OE) 3. [When The Party's Over by Billie Eilish](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b6WNdcZpDhQ) 4. [Old Town Road by Lil Nas X ft. Billy Ray Cyrus](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ysFgElQtjI) 5. [Me! by Taylor Swift ft. Brendon Urie](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuXNumBwDOM) 6. [Sweet But Psycho by Ava Max](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WXBHCQYxwr0) 7. [You Need To Calm Down by Taylor Swift](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dkk9gvTmCXY) 8. [Walk Me Home by P!nk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J1OsKJW51HY) 9. [High Hopes by Panic! At The Disco](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPXIgEAGe4U) 10. [I Don't Care by Ed Sheeran ft. Justin Bieber](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y83x7MgzWOA) Honorable Mentions (which you don't have to list if you don't want to but A. this is a preliminary attempt at a best list I might eventually put to video form and B. some of these cuts were really painful): Senorita by Shawn Mendes  amp; Camila Cabello, Bury A Friend by Billie Eilish, The Git Up by Blanco Brown, Breathin by Ariana Grande, Sunflower by Post Malone  amp; Swae Lee So that's my best list, what's everybody else's (if you know fewer than 10 of the year-end hot 100, substitute in any song you want as long as it came out in 2019, you like it, and it had at least moderate success)</TEXT>

    <TITLE>Fictional TV or movie couples with a male INTJ and female ESFJ?</TITLE>
    <DATE>2019-12-29 22:30:16</DATE>
    <TEXT>Not only are those my parents' types (dad's the INTJ, mom's the ESFJ) but I also found that at least according to personality-database.com that dynamic corresponds to central ships from two shows my family watches; Walter O'Brien and Paige Dineen from Scorpion and (despite it Ending Badly in a spoiler-y way so she could fall for the protag instead) Nathan Stark and Alison Blake from Eureka. That's why I want to know if there's any other shows or movies (especially those with a nerdier/sci-fi bent like my examples) with that kind of character dynamic in a couple because I kinda want to give my parents something new they could watch together and it might help them get into a new thing easier if they could see themselves reflected</TEXT>

    <TITLE>An Experiment For The New Decade</TITLE>
    <DATE>2020-01-01 10:07:19</DATE>
    <TEXT>As a filk aficionado who is also a Billboard chart-watcher at least as of beginning-of-last-year, I wonder, if we found particularly radio-friendly filk (be it "fantasy pop" like Charming Disaster or Cheshire Moon or something on the nerdier side like a Jonathan Coulton track or some nerdcore rap), assuming we could all agree on like 1-3 songs, if we could all listen to those songs on YouTube and various streaming services en masse, they could get enough traction to actually land on the Hot 100 (or at least the bubbling underchart or whatever that's called first). Here is where we have an opportunity to influence the music of an entire decade, at least if the charts work how I think they do. As if we can eventually get a filk song or two high enough on the Hot 100 through streaming and YouTube traction alone (as sometimes artists can have just that, look at Billie Eilish at first), the radio might end up picking them up which would not only expose more people to filk as a genre but at a certain point, if enough people liked the song and we kept "streaming bombing", it'd just keep feedback looping launching it higher potentially leading to more filk finding its way onto the charts either from established filk artists or established pop artists etc. taking their work in a more filky direction to hop on the trend. Who knows, if this happens early enough, we could potentially shape the music of the entire 20s to some degree So who'd want to try this and what filk song do you think has the highest chance of being a mainstream hit</TEXT>

    <TITLE>[Watchmen] Even if it isn't acknowledged in-universe, is there a canon Watchmen multiverse now and how does that shake out?</TITLE>
    <DATE>2020-01-05 07:10:22</DATE>
    <TEXT>So the main divergence-potentially-resulting-in-a-parallel-universe (at least Watsonianly) is Ozymandias's plan; in the book universe and show universe he uses a "space squid" while in the movie universe he uses (in two senses of the word) Dr. Manhattan. However, why I specified the book universe and show universe as two separate ones is because I noticed various differences in both plots (that weren't just "postcanon-to-the-book" stuff) and even character details like it's very unlikely Hooded Justice was both black and gay in the book (either one or the other or neither) like he is iirc in the show (easily Doylistically explained by the time period, Watsonian explanation is different universes). And also (though I can't recall what role if any Ozymandias played in it) there was the DC crossover event Doomsday Clock which obviously means a different-yet-similar one crossed over or the events would have been acknowledged unless another event retconned them out. So TL;DR how does the Watchmen multiverse shake out and does that mean we could either expect or someone like me could write if rights were gotten further additions to the story that don't take place in show canon (but wouldn't necessarily be "fix-it fic" for it)</TEXT>

    <TITLE>Help me out of this social gaffe I'm worried I made so I don't give in to analysis paralysis</TITLE>
    <DATE>2020-01-06 09:49:13</DATE>
    <TEXT>So I told my mom a quasi-morbid joke that I thought would jive with both her political sensibilities and sense of humor (that if dead people could have knowledge of the outside world after their death and roll in their graves at things that pissed them off like is the common idiom, hooking graves of oil execs up to generators or whatever could produce perpetual free energy as they'd be rolling in their graves from the knowledge that that was their fate, producing more energy to make them roll more) and mom just broke down crying and yelled "the last thing I need to imagine is people in their GRAVES" (as she had lost her parents within the last decade, even though the only similarity other than death to the execs in the joke is the general generation they were born in). Cue hour-long meltdown coupled with meta-melting-down-because-I-felt-guilty-about-doing-it-for-so-long and I'd like to walk you through my thought process during said meltdown so I can figure out how to feel less scared. First of all I didn't see any reason (blame poor theory of mind) why she should have been that triggered if she wasn't triggered by similar oblique mentions of death like the neighborhood's Halloween decorations or the many episodes of various crime shows like Law  amp; Order: SVU she watches. However, once she got triggered by even my mention of the word haunt to tell her how I was afraid of her being triggered by it I was afraid she'd be so triggered e.g. I couldn't even tell her I calmed down by remembering when we were trying to treat a sty on my eye and accidentally exploded an egg in the microwave because I was scared she'd think "that egg exploded, that's destruction, which is a kind of death". Second of all, because I couldn't think of anything realistic to try my mind immediately flashed to unrealistic solutions the first of which was immortality which I obviously couldn't talk to mom about even if I found it because it has to do with death and even if I could give immortality to myself and my family she'd probably just be mad I couldn't go back in time and give it to them if not everyone. And even if I could create a method of paradox-less time travel (if her memories weren't altered by my trip) to do that she'd be mad at me no matter if I told her or not she'd be mad if I told her I was doing it/did it because she hates me talking about time machines because I often propose using them to do-over misdeeds and she'd be mad if I didn't tell her because if I told her she could tell me to basically go fix all the disasters and make not just immortal humanity but FAGSLC from the dawn of time (Mom's a die-hard progressive, hence why I thought the joke would appeal to her) TL;DR Political joke went over like a lead balloon (not sure if because it's inherently offensive or not) and now I need some help for how to not feel like I have to essentially live out the plot of a utopian Oscar-bait sci-fi blockbuster (or at least how people would think one should have ended on the YouTube channels like that) in order to make Mom stop having me-level meltdowns at basically every implication of the existence of death</TEXT>
