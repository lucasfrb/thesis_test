    <TITLE>Easy trick for wood gathering!</TITLE>
    <DATE>2020-05-30 07:42:33</DATE>
    <TEXT>I always forget which trees I already chopped wood from. So I have a handy tip for you guys! I first chop all the wood from every tree without picking it up. Then when every tree has wood next to it you can pick it up! That way you can be sure you've hit every tree! Hope this helps some of you!  #9825;</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I showed him some of the replies of you guys and he said that people on reddit are a certain type of people (especially on this forum) and that if he would ask 'normal people' the same (like his coworkers for example) that they would side with him. I just can't fight him on this because I think he thinks he is always right.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Thank you. He told me that the reason he thinks its okay to do is because he thinks its not that big of a deal and not dangerous. I told him that rapists also think this way eventhough the two arent nearly comparable.</TEXT>

    <TITLE>Massive OCD / restart problem, need help!:(</TITLE>
    <DATE>2020-10-19 10:37:01</DATE>
    <TEXT>Hey guys! So I have had a massive issue ever since I discovered New Leaf. Whenever I start a game I have to do EVERYTHING ABSOLUTELY PERFECT! If I, for example, walk into a tree or don't position myself just right in front of a mailbox or item to interact with it I get a horrible feeling and if other things go 'wrong' after that I have to restart. The worst is when I walk into a villager and 'push' them on accident. If I make a mistake the whole 'save data' is ruined and the only way to keep playing is to clean my switch, delete my save and all the pictures I took and restart. I have played New Leaf thousands of times but didn't manage to keep a town for longer than 2 weeks at most. I'm a huge AC fan and got NH when it came out and have restarted 300 times at least. Im suffering extremely bad because of this. I don't have OCD in my normal day to day life but once I start a game of any kind I face this problem. I just don't know what to do, I just want to enjoy a town for more than a few hours/days.. I really hope some of you have any tips or maybe know why this happens to me. Please don't tell me to just enjoy it and don't worry about it, I know, I've tried. If i try to ignore the 'mistake' it gets worse in my head and eventually I have to restart because all the joy of playing vanishes. This really affects my mental health as well. If I manage to keep a town for 2 or 3 days Im ecstatic and can play for hours at a time, then when the inevitable happens I'm heartbroken.. Any tips are more than welcome !!!  lt;3</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Yes I've thought about this as well. I have pretty bad mental issues outside of games. I talked to someone about this a long while back and they said it's possible I lack a sense of 'control' in life and therefore want to do everything 'perfect' in games because I CAN control that part. Idk though thanks for replying, what you said made a lot of sense!</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I did this in New Leaf. If I did something wrong I simply quit without saving and tried again. This only worked a few times though. In NH you have the autosave so that would be difficult. However I'm gonna try the day back and then forward for sure, thanks so much.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Thank you so much, "trying to design your island with lots of space - wide paths and lots of space around items you interact with to minimize the possibility of bumping into villagers or misaligning yourself" this is an amazing idea! I restart the most on my first trip to a mystery island, because everything is so close together and you're just bound to bump into something. I don't think there's a solution to that tho. Thanks so much!!! lt;3</TEXT>
