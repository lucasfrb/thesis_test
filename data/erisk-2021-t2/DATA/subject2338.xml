    <TEXT>It #8217;s wild, a month ago I #8217;d never had therapy or a psych evaluation of any kind and then I went to my university #8217;s counseling center, had three counseling sessions and then was referred to a psych, went today for the evaluation and picked up my new prescription immediately after. It #8217;s wild I wasn #8217;t expecting this to happen so fast. But if any of you have access to free counseling at your university, I highly highly recommend going at least once, just to see what it #8217;s like. It #8217;s a really great starting point even if they can #8217;t offer you what you really need in the long run.</TEXT>

    <TITLE>What constitutes a missed dose?</TITLE>
    <DATE>2020-03-06 05:06:13</DATE>
    <TEXT>I just got prescribed a starting dose of lithium and Wellbutrin XL today. I #8217;ve never had to take medications daily before, the only other medication I #8217;ve been on is short release adderall, which I take whenever I need it. According to the info sheet I got for Wellbutrin, if you miss a dose, you should just skip it and take your next dose on schedule. But I #8217;m very unsure about what a missed dose is exactly; if I #8217;m scheduled to take it at 9am every morning, and I don #8217;t remember to take it until, say, 10:30am, did I miss the dose? How much wiggle room is there?</TEXT>

I don #8217;t think anyone means to glorify it at all but I totally get what you mean. And I also feel like if someone were thinking about cutting themselves for the first time and then came across this sub, they would immediately wanna fit in with it.

    <TEXT>I #8217;m not a parent, so I really can #8217;t say, but I imagine that the way your child views those scars, both on you and on other people they may come across, is largely up to how you explain it to them. I think telling them the truth once they finally ask is really important, so that they can learn about it in a safe environment, from someone they love, and so that they don #8217;t form negative opinions about people who self harm, or who have mental illnesses. And, also so that in the future if they have issues like this as well (hopefully not!), they #8217;ll know you will understand. If you tell them the truth in a casual manner, and use it as a moment to teach your kid to be kind to others and especially to themselves, then I feel you wouldn #8217;t have to worry about your scars having a negative impact on them. You don #8217;t have to go in to detail, you could just describe it as a symptom of an illness you had/have. Idk. I #8217;m no expert whatsoever, but I hope maybe that helps you a little? I #8217;m wishing you the best though  lt;3</TEXT>

    <TEXT>hi this is really late but my best friend went through something really similar. I guess that system is in place so that they can avoid the possibility that hormones might make your mental illness worse, just due to the altering of chemicals in your brain, but you #8217;re right, it is pretty backwards, because your mental health is deeply connected to your identity. My friend #8217;s first therapist wouldn #8217;t give their approval for my friend to start T, so he just had to switch to a different therapist that would. I believe he found the new therapist based on a recommendation from his pediatrician, but you could also probably do some searching on PsychologyToday, or you could ask around local online trans/queer groups, like maybe there #8217;s a Facebook page or something for a local queer organization? I dunno, I hope that #8217;s at least a little bit helpful. I #8217;m so sorry you #8217;re dealing with this, it was so painful watching my best friend suffer through that and I hate to see others go through it too.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>my expressive cultures class was called Sounds, it was with prof Louis Karchin and it was about opera and operatic music. I thought it was super boring at first but then I got really into it! There were assigned readings and we were also supposed to watch some operas outside of class but I did absolutely none of that, only showed up and half listened, and I passed with an A. I think that was an easy class bc music is not something you can teach in depth to students who know nothing about it to begin with, so the expectations were not very high.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I #8217;m really proud of you for opening up to your fianc #233;, and I #8217;m very glad to hear that he was supportive. Also yes, I #8217;ve definitely found that self harm has forced me to be things I #8217;m not or say things I don #8217;t believe in. I hate wearing long sleeves, even in the winter, but this summer is about to be a lot of me pretending that I #8217;m just super cold all the time, even though it #8217;s 80 degrees out. Back when I used to cut on my legs too, my mom would often ask if I wanted to go get a pedicure with her and even though I wanted to, I had to act like I didn #8217;t care for pedicures or whatever. Not big stuff at all, but it definitely doesn #8217;t feel good to be forced to act a certain way just to cover up your destructive habit. It #8217;s not that I feel that lying in certain cases is morally wrong; I think we all have a right to keep secrets. But it just sucks to have to align yourself with so many traits that aren #8217;t really yours:</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I #8217;m just referring to the feeling of going deeper than ever before and still not being satisfied, it very quickly gets to a point where you #8217;re never satisfied and your perception of your cuts is skewed, you think that cuts that are actually really deep are not deep at all. In no time at all this can lead you to doing things that seriously endanger your health. I think it #8217;s important for people to be aware of this feeling and try to remind themselves that their cuts are PLENTY deep already, and the need to go deeper is just your addiction/depression/etc talking.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>That #8217;s incredibly confusing to me. What do they think a sub like selfharmpics is even for? There are huge numbers of us who look at pictures to curb urges and there shouldn #8217;t be any shame in that. There #8217;s also no shame in being 30 and self harming. This is the kind of response I #8217;d expect from someone who #8217;s never self harmed in their life and thinks poorly of those that do. Edit: I looked at the mod #8217;s post and comment history and it #8217;s filled with r-pe p-rn, misogyny, and general  #8220;edginess #8221;.

    <TEXT>I #8217;ve heard someone else talk about this theory too, back when the first season came out (maybe it was you?) and they also mentioned that Jen and Judy have the same initials. I guess I just have to wonder what level of attention was paid by the writers and if tiny little things like that are coincidences or not. Your theory is super interesting to think about though, and regardless I think you #8217;re definitely right that this series has a fight-club-esque twist coming.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I would #8217;ve bet that if Jen had kept the footage and shown it to the police, that she could #8217;ve gotten away with it, or at least gotten in way less trouble. Because even though he was turned away from her, he was still being very threatening, and refusing to leave when Jen asked him to. So I feel like she could #8217;ve worked with that. BUT, it seems like she panicked and thought for certain that she was a murderer, and what she did in light of all that is what actually made her a criminal. Just like how it wasn #8217;t the fact that Judy hit Ted that made her a criminal, but rather the fact that she drove away.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>My case was way different from what OP described (that experience sounds downright awful ): ), I admitted myself by going to a behavioral health ER where they then transferred me to an inpatient facility. I #8217;m over 18 so I could legally voluntarily admit myself, but if you #8217;re a minor, your parents can bring you and I think it still counts as voluntary commitment. Involuntary commitment is a different can of worms and I think is more like what OP described, that #8217;s when the doctors or police or whomever make the decision that you are not stable and need to be watched for your own safety, whether you want to be admitted or not. Edit; lemme add that I was not actively suicidal, I just went bc of self harm. Which is a valid reason to go as well, you don #8217;t have to be on the very brink of suicide to get help if you want it.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Oh man this breaks my heart. I #8217;m so so so so so fucking sorry that something or someone has made you wish you weren #8217;t gay. I really hope that you #8217;ll feel differently one day, because being gay is so wonderful once you realize that absolutely nothing in the world can stop your love. Homophobes can shout all they want, churches can ban gays, bigots can try (and fail) to take away your rights, but none of that is more powerful than your capacity to love the same gender. I #8217;m so goddamn sorry that you don #8217;t feel that way. I #8217;m so goddamn sorry that your life has been made harder because you #8217;re gay. You don #8217;t deserve that. You really really really. really. do not deserve that. Fuck anyone or anything that keeps you from accepting yourself.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I can't answer all your questions, but I do have a bit of experience with using NYU mental health services. I struggle with serious depression and suicidal thoughts too, with a healthy dose of self harm on top. I'd never gotten help in my life before this semester, when I started seeing a therapist/counselor (those are the same thing) at the wellness center. I came in for a drop in session after a prof reported me, and they immediately set me up with two appointments for the following two weeks. After that, I kept seeing my therapist (Wanda Ramos is her name, she's wonderful) every two weeks, and I continued to see her regularly over zoom after the pandemic. I don't have NYU insurance, or even an insurance that covers anything outside of my home state, but I still got regular therapy for a lengthy amount of time. The limit never came, because they care more about making sure you're safe than about getting you through the system. I've only stopped seeing Wanda now because I have a new therapist at home. Maybe you've done this already, but what you should do is call the wellness hotline (or email, or securely message through the student health care portal), tell them what you're looking for, and they can help you from there. They can give you information about what they offer, whether you need certain insurance for it, AND they can also help you find something outside of NYU if thats what you need. You can give them your insurance and your location and they can find you a bunch of options that work for any of your requirements and preferences. Also, you can meet with these folks over Zoom, which I don't think costs anything internationally? So if you're cool with that, it's definitely a great option. It freaked me out at first but zoom therapy is not much different from regular therapy. I think, also, you should mention to them that you're having suicidal thoughts. That's really serious, and will probably give you some priority. I think it did for me. I honestly don't know if that helps at all, but maybe seeing the experience of someone else with really similar issues will give you an idea of what might be in store? Idk. I'm not an expert on their services at all. But I know that they saved me from probably chopping my whole arm off. If it were not for Wanda, I would still be living in secrecy, wearing long sleeves all the time, and lying to my parents. So I'm really grateful for them, even if the whole system isn't great. Regardless of it all, though, I really hope you end up getting the help you deserve. No one should have to feel that way. Please stay safe.</TEXT>

It #8217;s just really hard not to compare yourself to others. When I went off to college, I made absolutely no friends, picked up cutting again, failed a bunch of classes and basically stayed in my dorm all day every day. It sucked so much scrolling through Instagram and seeing pictures of all my high school friends going to parties, making lifelong friends, and showing off their achievements. I #8217;m sorry that you #8217;re feeling that way too.</TEXT>

It #8217;ll still definitely do something though, so long as you #8217;re sure to use it every day, or at least as often as possible.

    <TEXT>Maybe it would help if you wrote down some things you wanna say first, so you can sort of organize your thoughts before going into it. You could even give yourself a script to open with and then once you can manage to get that out ya mouth you can continue from there. Really, it doesn #8217;t matter how you say it, how you start, whether you look them in the eye or not, it doesn #8217;t matter so long as you can just get the information across. You could even write it down and hand it to them.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>ok I know I #8217;m seven days late but. Vaping is not entirely bad for you, it doesn #8217;t weaken your immune system so that you wouldn #8217;t be able to fight corona. Vaping can be dangerous, yes, but those cases of serious issues come from what #8217;s IN the vape, not the act of vaping itself. Nicotine e-liquid that you can buy in a store is safe. But illegal vape cartridges, like ones with THC in them, can be dangerous because they #8217;re being sold on the black market and so there #8217;s no regulation about what goes in them, nor any way of knowing what #8217;s in them. If your partner is using e-liquid purchased from a real store, they #8217;ll be just fine! I mean, it #8217;s still something they should try to quit, but in the meantime, they #8217;ll be okay. It #8217;s very sweet that you care about them so much, they #8217;re lucky to have you!</TEXT>

    <TEXT>This is so relatable lmao but also, you can define your own progress however you please. If you don #8217;t feel the need to count something then you don #8217;t have to and you can still say it #8217;s a clean streak. I think since self harm comes in so many forms, it #8217;s hard to actually stay clean from all of them at once. Especially so with scratching and hitting, bc ya can #8217;t get rid of your own hands. Maybe consider starting with keeping a clean streak from cutting specifically, and then begin adding in attempts to stay clean from hitting, scratching, etc.</TEXT>

Resentment for women does not get you a date my friend! Some of them will find you unattractive, some will find you hot as fuck.

    <TEXT>ugh TRUE, it always jars me when mental health professionals (or medical professionals in general) say  #8220;cutting #8221; instead of  #8220;self harm #8221;.

    <TEXT>I think it #8217;s incredibly important for mental health professionals to pay close attention to any form or degree of self harm, so that they can help you stop it before it snowballs into something life threatening. My therapist did something similar when I brought up my self harm, and when she saw my cuts I think she decided they weren #8217;t  #8220;bad enough #8221;. Two months later, I landed myself in the hospital bc it got so severe. I think it is a typical response, because the thought process there is sort of like,  #8220;well, self harm is your only coping mechanism and you aren #8217;t hurting anyone else by doing it, so it #8217;s fine for now #8221; which I guess has some validity to it, but the much more pressing issue there is the fact that self harm is an addiction and will only keep getting worse. You should try bringing it up again. I #8217;m sure your therapist did not intend to dismiss you like that, and maybe if you express your concern about it a bit more than they #8217;ll see that it #8217;s a bigger problem than they thought? Don #8217;t try and tell yourself that your self harm is not a big deal, or not  #8220;bad enough #8221;. You deserve to be heard about this.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I #8217;ma tell u a secret: if you don #8217;t wanna count it, you don #8217;t have to. It #8217;s real fuckin hard to just drop all self harm altogether, so imo, if you have to do it in steps, that #8217;s just fine. Even if you #8217;re technically self harming in other ways, you still have a 111 day clean streak from yeeting and you should be really proud! And then hopefully soon you #8217;ll be able to stay clean from burning too! But it #8217;s ok to take it piece by piece if you have to. You #8217;re still moving towards recovery.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>In almost every medical setting I #8217;ve been, doctors have completely ignored my scars. I think they have a good understanding of patient privacy. Only once on my third visit to a physical therapist did she make a small comment about my scars, and it was very respectful and polite, she just wanted to know if I was getting help. I imagine your dermatologist would be the same, although if telling them before hand would make you feel more comfortable, that #8217;s not a bad idea! I do that with friends I haven #8217;t seen in a long time, just to get it out of the way first, since I know they #8217;d be obligated to ask.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I still like Jen but I was a little put off by her this season too. I think there was such a difference between how Judy and Jen each handled killing the other #8217;s partner. Judy was overwhelmed with guilt that she turned into doing anything and everything she could for Jen. Jen too was overwhelmed by guilt but it just culminated into a lot of crying and  #8220;I #8217;m sorry I #8217;m so terrible #8221; type of stuff. Like in the episode where they buried Steve and Jen wasn #8217;t understanding of judy #8217;s mood. Obv there #8217;s tons and tons of other factors involved that make their situations different but that was just the one key thing that made me raise my eyebrows at Jen a bit.</TEXT>

The academic system is not structured well, especially not for people who struggle with mental illness. Grades don #8217;t reflect your abilities, your intelligence, your talent, or any of what makes you a good person. I know it #8217;s still stressful anyway, because whether we like it or not, grades can have an impact on our future, but I just wanna make sure you know that failing is okay. You can fail a million times over and over again and it would still be okay. Please, please be kind to yourself.  lt;3</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I #8217;m not sure there #8217;s much you can do at this point if they #8217;ve already faded to your skin color. Most products used to fade scars focus on reducing the redness. But it might still be worth a shot to try silicone scar gel, like Mederma or ScarAway. I #8217;ve also heard of people using bio oil, whatever that is? You can find lots of info on these products if you search  #8220;how to fade scars #8221;! Other than that, tattoo coverup might be a good choice, or you could also talk to your doctor or dermatologist and see if there are any procedural options.</TEXT>

I was so terrible at it because if I couldn #8217;t figure out the answer in 10 minutes or less, I got incredibly frustrated and gave up.

    <TEXT>I watched the show first, but as I was reading the book I had myself wondering how in the world I never saw the ending coming. I didn #8217;t even suspect adora until the first hint or so came around. But alllllllllll the times that they insisted that the killer was a man were such clear indications that the killer was a woman, and if it #8217;s a woman, it pretty much has to be either adora or amma. Somehow though I was thoroughly shocked. I guess while watching I wasn #8217;t focused as much on the murder story as I was on Camille and her family issues.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>It #8217;s not brought up as much in the book I don #8217;t think, although the whole  #8220;woman in white #8221; thing doesn #8217;t exist in the book. So James Capisi #8217;s testimony is just about him seeing a woman take Natalie, which imo gives it a ton more credit and makes it more obvious that the killer has to be a woman.</TEXT>

In high school I was the president of a club for three years and I ran every meeting and it gave me horrifying stomach aches and sleepless nights, but I still did it well.

    <TEXT>Yeah, I definitely feel the same about the more up close social interactions. Those are the ones where I actively feel like everyone hates me. I can stutter on a presentation and brush it off but having an awkward personal interaction with someone makes me wanna claw my skin off. I #8217;m REALLY glad to hear that meds have been helping you! I #8217;ve not tried any meds for anxiety and I think I #8217;d really like to because I #8217;m so tired of living like this even when my brain logically understands it #8217;s ridiculous.

    <TEXT>My classes are definitely majority male, but there #8217;s still a decent amount of women in the department. One thing I don #8217;t really like is having a class that #8217;s mostly men with a male teacher. Math is a hard subject so the people who pursue it are usually quite smart... and I think sometimes the men in the classroom will start to get a bit arrogant, especially when the male professor also speaks arrogantly. Idk I #8217;m probably biased but I just generally really dislike  #8220;I #8217;m smarter than you #8221; attitudes in the math department and I tend to notice it a lot from my male peers. Aside from that though, I #8217;ve not been personally discriminated against! I think one of my favorite experiences in math so far was this summer camp I went to in high school. There was an equal amount of male and female students there AND of male and female professors. The aim of the program was to do high level mathematics in a really laid back, non serious way. There was no exclusionary jargon or anyone saying  #8220;cmon, it #8217;s so easy! #8221; and I loved that so much. It was just pure indulgence and discovery of fascinating mathematical topics all while laughing our asses off with each other. I try to remember the beauty and joy I found in mathematics while I was there when I #8217;m starting to feel like I #8217;m not good enough for the field.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I wouldn #8217;t say I #8217;m addicted either... I think addiction is just a really complicated thing that I don #8217;t fully understand. I mean, you can technically become addicted to anything, but not all addictions are created equal. Nicotine, for instance, creates a genuine chemical dependency where your body needs it in order to function. But my body definitely doesn #8217;t need sh to function. I do often find myself self harming daily, but I think that #8217;s only because it happens to be my favorite and most effective coping mechanism. It does tend to escalate though, I have to go deeper each time to be satisfied. Perhaps that #8217;s a symptom of addiction, but I #8217;m not sure. What I can say for sure is that all of our brains are vastly different, and I imagine there are others who DO feel that their bodily functions are dependent on self harm. Idk, shit #8217;s super complicated.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I participated in a study last year that wanted to look at adolescents (I #8217;m 19) with a history of suicidal ideation/self harm and see how capable they were of remembering past events and imagining future ones. Before I went they had me list over the phone 10 positive events and 10 negative events from the past five years. When I got there, much of the experiment consisted of me either describing some of the events I listed with great detail, or being given random elements from the events I listed and trying to imagine positive or negative future scenarios that could possibly take place involving those people/places/things (I hope that made sense lol). Anyways, I found it incredibly hard to imagine future scenarios. The results of the study aren #8217;t out yet I don #8217;t think, but I wonder if being suicidal/depressed really does make it harder for you to just visualize a potential future for yourself. I sure as shit can #8217;t do it. It #8217;s all blank.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Omg, you look so lovely!! I can #8217;t tell you how nice it is to see someone older than me have their scars out. I always worry that when I get older I #8217;ll end up really hating and regretting my scars. Idk why, I guess I #8217;m just afraid that at a certain point I #8217;ll feel  #8220;too old #8221; to have struggled with sh. But that #8217;s bullshit and I #8217;m really glad to see the living proof.  lt;3 congrats on 6 months!!</TEXT>
