Me: I don #8217;t know, it kind of just clicked. I realized that I like- Him: It in the ass. Both: *A good 30 seconds of laughter* Me: Thanks I needed that. That is what friends are for. Making you laugh even when you are nervous. Also, for clarification, the word I was going to say was guys. And if you are reading this Coco, thanks for that. You really made my day.</TEXT>

Try taking small steps away from self harm. It is really hard to do. Trust me, I was six days clean as of last night. You can also try to find someone to open up to. It will feel like you are dumbing your problems on someone else but it will help you. Again, I speak from experience. I know I am the last person that should be giving advice because I am in the same situation and failing every aspect of helping myself. I am just giving tips on what has helped me, no matter how small. Feeling this way sucks. Just know that you aren #8217;t alone.</TEXT>
