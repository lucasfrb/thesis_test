    <TITLE>What breed is my cat? She's 13, is enormous (at least 14 pounds), super fluffy with fur that sheds during the summer, and always responds with a mix of chirps and melodic meows every time she's spoken to and even talks to herself. When she was a baby she meowed so much she would do it while eating.</TITLE>

    <TEXT>The lack of ear and toe tufts was a another reason I doubted the Maine Coon hypothesis, but yes, she does have the same nose and her tail is enormously fluffy. She's probably just a mix of a few similar breeds but it drives me nuts because now I'm 25 (she still lives with my mom) and almost ready to get my own cat, and I'd love to find one similar to what she is.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>1. (2009-2010) My mom kicked me out of the house when I was 17 so she could be alone with her boyfriend who hated me, and I had to live with a bunch of friends while I finished high school. I got kidney disease from stress and my mom shows up at the hospital a year after not speaking to me and pretends she was there for me the whole time. Also, had to go to Navy boot camp less than a month after recovering from kidney disease. I still haven't truly forgiven my mom and it's been over a decade. 2. (2013) On my first Navy deployment, boyfriend of 2 years cheats on me and ignored me for weeks at a time, even though I waited for him on his 6 month deployment. 4. (2014) Was raped by someone on my base and the guy wasn't convicted because I had sent him flirty texts at one point, which they took as evidence of it being consensual. 3. (2015) A different boyfriend of 2 years cheated on me with his ex, on my 23rd birthday. 4. (2015) A guy I liked for a long time came over to my house and we hooked up. The next day he shows up at my front door with his crying fiance who has terminal cancer, who I had no idea existed. Things were pretty much good 2015-2017.... Met British guy and moved to England. Got married.. But then 6. (2018) Forced to leave the UK and go back to California while I was waiting for a marriage visa to go through so I could rejoin my husband in the UK, (we were newlyweds) so I while I was waiting alone, I was driving for uber and renting a room with a bunch of meth addicts in a really scary part of California. I heard shootings outside my window every night. Those were definitely the low points... But that's life. The high points have been equally as high! Just have to remember that you'll see the other side eventually and don't lose faith that things get better. :)</TEXT>

    <TITLE>The Ultimate New Girl Gamer List</TITLE>
    <DATE>2019-01-16 21:08:37</DATE>
    <TEXT>Hey, first time posting. About a year ago, my friend Linnea became curious as to why I spend so much time playing Xbox, and decided to buy one of her own. She asked me for a list of game recommendations, so I wrote this for her. She's absolutely obsessed with Xbox now too! I wanted to pass this on for anyone new, or just not sure what to play next. Enjoy!  #8203; 1. LA Noire (Detective Game set in 1940's Los Angeles. Speakeasies, Sex, Murder, Jazz, Movie Stars, Classic Cars.) 2. Murdered: Soul Suspect (Detective Game set in Salem Massachusets. Deals with the Salem Witch Trials and the Supernatural. More suspense than it is scary. Good game to play before Halloween.) 3. Life is Strange 1 and 2 and Before the Storm (Hipstery fun adventure game set in the Pacific Northwest where we live which I think is pretty cool) 4. The Wolf Among Us (I'm currently playing this. It's a detective game featuring famous Fairytale creatures struggling to survive in modern day New York City. It's a "choose your own story" decision making game like Life is Strange.) 5. All the Elder Scrolls Games (An open fantasy world where you can create your own character and go on epic quests by yourself or with friends in ESO. It really hooks you into it's universe so be careful, it WILL steal hours from your life.) 6. Red Dead Redemption (Beautiful picturesque game set in the Wild West. Really cool look at America in the 1800's. You can be a badass vigilante cowboy and ride a horse around the desert and solve hundreds of mysteries for the random citizens in the game.) 7. Alice: Madness Returns (Slightly darker twisted version of Alice in Wonderland, actually truer to the book than the Disney version. Beautiful visuals and art, many creative ideas in the game.) 8. Contrast (Dreamlike and surreal 1920s Parisian style world, inspired by the performance art world of vaudeville and film noir. You play as an imaginary woman who can transform from a human into a shadow at will, to climb and move in places a human couldn't.) 9. Dishonored (Set in a plague-ridden Steampunk universe, you play as a sneaky and intelligent man named Corvo Attano, bodyguard to the Empress of the Isles. He is framed for her murder and forced to become an assassin, seeking revenge on those who conspired against him. The thing I liked is that you can choose whether to be lethal and openly brash with your opponents, sneak attack them, or completely sneak past them without killing them at all. The choice is yours. the sequel to this just came out and I haven't played it yet.) 10. Left 4 Dead (My favorite game for playing online with strangers or with friends in the same room. It involves a lot of teamwork and communication with other players. It's very survival oriented and features a lot of "boss" like characters that keep the anticipation amongst the group going. ) 11. Dead Island (The plot focuses on four playable survivors trying to survive and escaping off the fictional island of Banoi. It involves a lot of crafting of weapons and strategic thinking about where to move around the island to survive. Basically it's like a Hawaiian beach resort that's been completely zombified.) 12. The Walking Dead (Made by Telltale, the same company that made The Wolf Among Us. It's another choose your own adventure game. It's more story based and nothing like the TV series, it's more closely related to the graphic novels which came first. I wasn't sure if I'd like it at first but the characters are heartwarming and completely won me over, especially Clementine. The second game is out and I haven't played it yet but look forward to it.) 13. Resident Evil Revelations 1 amp;2 (Really engrossing stories with cool characters and lots of jump scares, gets my blood pumping more than any other game, but even if you're scared you won't wanna stop playing!) 14. Layers of Fear (A haunted house where the scenery and house itself is constantly changing in the strangest way. You unravel the mystery as you travel through the house. Very unique game.) 15. Saints Row (The most random silly game ever, it's a bit like if Grand Theft Auto KNEW how rediculous it was. I mean, there's a freaking dildo sword, and a cheat code that let's you turn everyone into hookers.) 16. South Park and the Stick of Truth (It's South Park, and you can play it. Enough said.)  #8203;  #8203;  #8203;</TEXT>

    <TITLE>Sometimes you feel strange for a reason.</TITLE>
    <DATE>2019-01-18 20:09:43</DATE>
    <TEXT>When my fiance (now husband) and I moved to our first flat together in Durham England about 2 years ago, I had my first strange experience with the paranormal. About me: I'm American, I'm not religious, and have visited various famous "haunted" locations in America, without ever encountering anything supernatural or having any reason to believe in the paranormal prior to this incident. My husband is also not religious and still doesn't believe (although he can't deny the facts in the story). He was also at work during a lot of the incidents. First, a few details about the location of the apartment. The flat was located above a 200 year old pub, not the oldest place by British standards, but sure as hell older than most American establishments. And it wasn't a nice pub either, it was a dirty, smoky bar where the roughest people in town hung out. We saw stabbings in front of the place several times, one time a guy even wiped his bloody limb on our front door. The aquiring of the place was a bit odd. The place appeared on the market out of nowhere. The landlord also owned the pub. It was oddly cheap, 1 bedroom 1 bath and a giant kitchen and living room for only 500 pounds a month. He didn't require any fees, credit checks, or security deposits upon move in. The whole process of getting the place just struck me as really strange. He just seemed VERY eager to rent out the flat. The first day we went to see it I had some weird first impressions. The layout was the kind where you have a front door downstairs, which immediately leads into a staircase, that takes you up to the flat. When we got there it did look like the pictures, but OH MY GOD the smell. It smelled like cigarettes and years of sadness. I don't know how it smelled like sadness, or how to explain it better, but it just did. And the stairs. I had the weirdest feeling going up those stairs, I couldn't explain it, but it was like a deep feeling of existential depression in the pit of my stomach. I didn't think much of it, so I told my husband we're not moving in until we get the place professionally cleaned, but we should take the place as we needed the money to save for our wedding and immigration paperwork. When the place had been cleaned move in day came, we got settled in as much as we could. My husband went to work the first day, and I was home alone as usual doing school work online finishing my degree. I could not work at the time because I didn't have a visa yet. The place was partly furnished. There was a wardrobe, a dresser, and some kitchen supplies. The first day I was home alone, I opened the dresser. Inside were some little decorations that said "home", a mug with a sun on it, a dog bed, and a "My Dog Skip" DVD. "What weird things to leave behind " I thought. Something suddenly compelled me to keep the things, as I thought they were too cute to donate, other than the dog bed because we didn't have a dog. I decided to start decorating the place. I bought a shelf for the bathroom, and as I brought it in, I noticed some odd looking smudges on the floor and wall. Upon closer inspection, they were clearly dark brown blood-like stains, mostly around the sink. I cleaned them up the best I could with bleach, not thinking much other than that the cleaning lady didn't do a great job. The next day, the spots were in more places, as if I just hadn't noticed them. This went on in new places for about a week. The same thing happened with a splotch of black mold at the top of the staircase. It just kept coming back and growing in the same exact spot, the entire time we lived there. I always avoided the bathroom and staircase like the plague other than to shower and clean them. I always felt so depressed there, no matter how I decorated the areas. The kitchen and living room felt fine. The bedroom always felt like my husband and I were being watched, but not by something bad. So all of this was going on, and I had no idea why I felt this way for MONTHS. I thought I was going crazy due to not working and being home too much. I was getting random bouts of mood swings depression, which isn't like me. I was pretty much at my wits end, when one night... My husband and I went out drinking until about 1 am on New Year's Eve. We came home, to a strange dude, staring straight up at our kitchen window, bottle in his hand, crying. The back patio of the pub was near our front gate/door, so we figured he stumbled over drunk for there. He was blocking our gate, so we asked him what he was doing there. He said that his girlfriend had commit suicide in the apartment just DAYS before we had moved in. I told the guy to take the time he needed. My husband was surprised. I wasn't. I was relieved. I just knew then that everything I had been experiencing was a result of this energy that had been left behind in our place. A mixed petri dish of emotions, left behind in my house. I honestly think that part of her is still there, I'm not sure how much, but part of that lady is there.</TEXT>

I did have an easier time living there and coping with the "emotions" of the house (best way to describe it) after I knew of her story because it actually made sense. The hardest thing was before I knew because I didn't understand why I felt so weird all the time or like crying in certain rooms etc.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Its actually funny you say that, I'm studying interior design and huge fan of real wood and stone furnishings :) I feel like using certain materials and decorating your house well can really cleanse it of bad energy. It's probably no coincidence that the asian culture is very in touch with both spirituality and Feng Shui. I always found the energy to be more depressing than violent, like depressing to the point of feeling no energy to go about your day, or finding the will to live, it was just so sad feeling. I think if anything it will make me more sensitive to recognizing similar things in the future.</TEXT>

When I was 19, a guy I didn't even know stuck his testicles in my face when we were literally in our workshop, and because he was a second class PO and I was a 3rd class, and there were 5 people present and nobody said anything. I was really young and innocent at the time and when I think back that I had no power over the situation it absolutely sickens me. Girls deal with this crap in every career, not just hollywood.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Related random story: I've always been really into crafting, and I used to run this sewing club in high school where I taught sewing to students. The sweetest thing ever happened, the quarterback on our football team wanted to learn, but was afraid of being judged. I taught him how to make his own embroidered gym bag and his teamates were jealous! I still think it's amazing when people do things out of what everyone thinks they should be confined to.

    <TEXT>The reason for it happening in the first place is a different story. It typically happens because shitty behavior is tolerated in the workplace in small doses, thus deeming even worse things acceptable. The "boys talk" and harassment I witnessed in my work center when I was 19-20 years old will stick with me for life. Therefore when I was raped, while devastating, it actually came as no surprise.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Hi Lily Thankfully today I have healed most of the emotional wounds caused by the incident. I have a supportive husband and friends and saw a number of counselors following the incident. At the time it happened I was beyond suicidal and had to be hospitalized because I tried to harm myself, and they found a knife in my room and when I went to Captian's Mast, (The Navy's version of court) they tried to say I was going to use it to stab my rapist. Sounds crazy, but they literally said that to me when I was in a suicidal state of mind. I'd say the thing that was the most hurtful was the impact the assault had on my career (I was immediately honorably discharged, even though my contract wasn't supposed to end for 6 more months and I didn't want to stop working) and the lack of support or belief from coworkers/leadership. I don't want to reopen the case because I don't have enough faith that something will be come in my favor, after having seen the documentary "The Invisible War", things don't seem that they're at a better place yet. I think the only thing victims can do is keep.spreading awareness, which is what I'm still trying to do 6 years later.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>We're just like everyone else, if we seem more extreme, it's probably because we've literally been pushed to the far extent of our emotional and physical well being multiple times. There's a higher chance we've also seen a side of men that very few women ever see, so we approach relationships with a bit more caution and discretion. But I think you'll find we're also the bravest, most loyal and hardworking women out there, which means we'll fight for a relationship through thick and thin. I think my husband appreciates this! He'd probably be better off answering this question! haha</TEXT>

His apathy towards us was sickening. Why my mom chose to try to bring someone like that into our family I'll never know. Then again before I was born she married my dad, a wealthy older man, and became a step mother in her early twenties to two older girls (my half sisters) who she never bonded with herself, so maybe she never had a problem with that kind of apathetic step relationship.</TEXT>

    <TITLE>My Uber driver tried to convince me to have babies.</TITLE>
    <DATE>2019-03-28 18:21:43</DATE>
    <TEXT>I usually chat with Uber drivers, as I enjoy talking to new people. I told this particular driver last week that my husband and I have been happily married for 1.5 years, and he asked if we were trying for kids yet. I said "no, neither of us really have the urge to become parents". He then spent the entirety of my 30 minute trip trying to persuade me into starting a family, and how essentially there's no greater pleasure in life than popping out babies and watching them grow. He was so fired up about it, and the fact that I was calmly telling him my childfree stance on things was really pissing him off. It's amazing to me that even someone you just met would feel comfortable to tell you how to live your life, and how your family should be defined. Needless to say, he didn't get a tip, and I always tip. Sidenote: He was Indian, and I imagine it's even more ingrained in Indian society have have a big family than it is in other parts of the world. I can't even imagine being a childfree Indian woman having to deal with that bullshit all the time.</TEXT>

Puerto rican people struggle with acne a lot in youth (I've had it my whole life) but then it pays off later in adulthood with younger looking skin. Look at JLO and Rita Moreno. My grandma is full blooded Puerto Rican and 76 and looks about 65 or younger. Aside from genes, vitamin E moisturizer every morning and night, take vitamins, drink water and eat a lot fruit. Also i'm overweight for my height, so I have a decent amount of fat in my face, people with less fat in the face tend to age quicker.</TEXT>

As my skin gets better, I wear lighter and lighter coverage foundation. When all of the scarring and redness is gone, I could see switching to just a bb cream. I wear eyeliner to accentuate my eyes, I just like how it makes them look bigger and rounder without much effort. I also fill my brows to match my natural root hair color, since they're much lighter than my hair for some reason and I'm ocd and like things to match.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I live in the UK and every flat seems to have a no pet policy, because of "how much damage animals cause". While it may be true that animals can cause some property damage if left unattended, is this even anywhere near the scale that children can cause to a property? There doesn't seem to be any rules surrounding those types of damages. My childfree husband and I will never get to experience the joy of adopting or fostering a pet at long as we live in a flat, but popping out babies to live with us is A-Okay with the landlords. Ridiculous.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Why is it acceptable for a young male doctor to ask me 800 questions about why my husband and I don't want kids, more specifically my reasoning as a woman? "What, you don't like kids?" He honestly seemed shocked at my response. "No I just don't want any. There's no deeper reason." He looked at me like I was the fucking devil in the flesh. How is not wanting to procreate such a profound statement to make to some people, when to me it seems such a simple decision to make, and is basically instinct? How are people practicing medicine that blind to different adult lifestyles? Luckily I have a female doctor who is wonderful and the only reason I had to see this trust fund, preppy, dude-bro, polo wearing asshole is because she's on holiday. This is the first bad GP experience I've had in the UK to be fair, the doctors in the states were actually overall much worse about this topic.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Travel is so important. I'm gonna go ahead and be in the unpopular opinion club. I am an American woman who lives in the UK, who currently works in the IT field with predominantly Muslim Pakistani men. These men are very kind and respectful. I also used to be deployed with the Navy in the middle east (both Bahrain and UAE). The most disrespectful and dangerous men I encountered during that time in my life were sailors on my ship. I'm gonna call bullshit on all of you who haven't traveled to these parts of the world or worked/lived with people from these cultures. First of all, as a woman, I wouldn't travel almost anywhere alone, period. Second of all, stop believing everything you read in the news and watch on TV. Go live some actual experiences before you form an opinion on this subject. Stop making assumptions about cultures you don't know, and people you've never met. Third of all, I'm aware of the dangers women face in these parts of the world. Am I gonna stop traveling and meeting people from these cultures and religions out of fear? Fuck no. If you're terrified to leave your country, that's on you. An "us vs. them" mentality is why we have issues in this world to begin with.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I agree with everything the other comments say. For comparison, my husband is super skinny, and we get the same reactions even though neither of us is conventionally attractive. It's not so much the level of attractiveness as the difference in body type. He's a men's small-medium and I'm a women's 1X. Funnily enough, my type my entire life has been skinny dudes, so I knew it was always gonna be a thing from the time I was a child. As long as you want each other, that's all that matters, fuck other people's shitty opinions.</TEXT>

And you know what came with my healthy cycle? Horrendous cramps, and one more thing.. Mittlesmerz! Yeah, I now get mini cramps during ovulation as well, that also hurt like a bitch.

    <TEXT>No, and I am vegan and support being vegan. What I don't support is toxic, rude people who claim to live "kind lifestyles" when they can't even be kind to someone on a reddit thread who is debating becoming a vegan. How about positive encouragement, instead of screaming at someone. Hope you're winning a lot of people over with that vinegar, when you could be sharing some vegan honey.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I see, this is where people use the condescending "I'm better than you because I did it this way, and my way is the only right way" tactic. Bet this works on load of open minded people who are just experimenting with the idea of being vegan for the first time. Bet it sets a really good first impression for people who are dismissive of the idea too. Bet you win over tons of people.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Guess they're lost causes too, so we should just forget about setting a good example and showing them what a kind vegan looks like and making it seem appealing in any way. You know people who are debating being vegan look at these subs? I was one of them! I have posts on this subreddit with hundreds of upvotes about lovely foods to try for new vegans, encouraging people rather than smiting them. And I'm also not afraid to share my opinion, even if it's contrversial to the majority of people in this community and gets downvoted a lot. You're so condescending and big headed about veganism it's fucking disgusting. Veganism should be a selfless act, but people like you make it about yourselves and how "wonderful" you are for saving the planet, and how easy it was for you. Well guess what? It's about the whole planet, non-vegans included, not just you.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>But for real I'm an actual super fair skinned neutral and I can't find a good color match to save my life. Anyone have good suggestions? Most foundations in the lightest share are for pink undertones, and when I try the lightest neutral shade it's either too yellow or too dark. The closest shade match I've found is ecru from estee lauder double wear, which is the exact tone I need but tends to oxidize a bit dark on me.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Any fellow Capricorn Sun/Pisces Moons? The biggest struggle I've found is that I'm someone who constantly wants to use reasoning and logic in my decision making, but my emotions are always getting the best of me. I recently changed roles in my job to a position I knew I would hate because I was easily guilt tripped into it and didn't want to dissapoint my managers, just one example. Sometimes I wish I was as strong willed as my Cap husband and friends, who seem to never fall victim to their emotions when it comes to making important decisions. I feel like I'm all reason all the time until my heart starts screaming at me out of nowhere to do some stupid shit. Anyone relate?</TEXT>

    <TEXT>My husband and I are both caps (both birthdays this week) and we go through bouts of depression together all the time. It's nice having someone to go through it with to be honest, we both just shut the world out for as long as we need to, holing up in the house, we both understand if one or none of us has any sex drive, and we make sure neither of us in turning to unhealthy methods (drinking too much) to deal with the issue. Ideally you gotta find a partner who just gets it. But also I agree with the other person who says you need to focus on yourself too, relationships don't even work otherwise.</TEXT>

I do this at least 3 times a week and have my own "salad bar'. As long as you use enough meat/nuts/protein it's a really filling easy lunch! It's a bit expensive on the first shop, but I just buy and replace ingredients as I run out.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Anyone live in Eccles, Ellesmere/Monton area? What was going on at 1am last night? Saw outside my window when I got up for a glass of water 2 police officers tracking down 2 guys in our flat car park. Looks like they were caught doing something like stealing maybe? The guys started yelling at the male officer, sounded like they were resisting arrest and didn't believe he was a cop until he pulled his badge out and one got tackled or tazed. Officer was screaming for female officer to call for back up, then helicopters started circling the area, female officer was searching bushes around the building with a torch, maybe looking for one who got away? Anyways this is a really nice quiet area normally and haven't heard anything like that by our flats before.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>It is such a nice area, seems like scummy people keep creeping in more and more from surrounding areas in eccles though to commit crimes. That's why I was so shaken by it, of course it also had to happen right outside my bedroom window the night my husband left on a business trip. Also i'm American and I grew up in LA so I kept half expecting to hear gun shots. My neighbor is a police officer so my first instinct was that it was him in plain clothes or something.</TEXT>

I'm a married woman who's had total nightmares with every hormonal birth control she's ever tried, including pills, rings and IUDs. I hate the feeling of condoms as they dry me out severely and I think lube feels gross. I use a diva cup as my period method and really love the convenience of it so I'm used to sticking cup like things up there already. After a lot of research and narrowing it down to these 2 methods I want to hear from people who've tried them. Thoughts?</TEXT>

It could be right for you and you may not get any of this, but just hope you've done research on this just in case. Doesn't hurt to look at the bad and the good.</TEXT>

    <TITLE>So my alcoholic absent father who fled to Mexico when I was 13 and my little brother was 8, passed away recently. I guess this is what his four children (I have 2 older half sisters) amounted to in his life. A dirty trash bag. If you needed any further proof that alcohol can ruin lives.</TITLE>

Ex: Here Comes the Sun, While My Guitar Gently Weeps, Something, Love You To, Only A Northern Song, Within You Without You, Inner Light, Blue Jay Way, It's All Too Much. The only contender for these songs in my opinion is Norwegian Wood. George was a total babe inside and out and way ahead of his time. May he rest in peace.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I definitely think you hit the nail on the head with muted colors, I should have clarified and said that I look good in all muted colors from summer and autumn palettes, and even pastels from light spring. I think the issue is I'm a true neutral in every aspect when it comes to skin hair and eyes, there's an equal amount of warmth and coolness. An example is with foundations, any with hints of pink are far too pink and any with hints of tan are far too orange, I usually go with whatever the lightest and most yellow foundation is.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I am in UK so you may have to modify if in another country. Ingredients Sugar or sweetener of your choice (I use Sugar and Crumbs vegan icing sugar, as many sugars contain bone char!) 1 Sheet Jus Rol Gluten Free Pastry 1/3 Cup Elmlea Plant Double Cream 2 Cups Frozen or Fresh Strawberries Cut a sheet of Jus Rol Gluten Free Puff Pastry into circles with a cookie cutter, stack 2 circles on top of each other in rows, bake at 180 #176;c for 15 minutes or until golden and puffed up nicely. While this is baking, whip the cream up until nice and fluffy, for whipped cream texture use as is, for thicker creme puff like texture, whip, then refrigerate for an hour. Take 2 cups of strawberries in a bowl and mix with sugar of your choice. For more syrupy strawberries like I used, use thawed frozen strawberries. When pastry is done, let cool. Cut in half so there's a top and a base from each pastry. Top the base with the cream, then the strawberries on top of that. Then add your pastry top and whala!</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Nutritious_plants, I just wanna say that your approach in trying to get people to go vegan is very forceful, (judging by your other posts/comments) I've had a lot more luck exposing people in my life to my veganism by being kind and showing them the benefits of the lifestyle for us and the planet in a positive way than a negative way. I know there are many many negative effects of the non vegan lifestyle but I think it's more appealing to people who are new to the idea if we still treat them with respect.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Nope, my husband and I are both non confrontational about our veganism with others and we plan to stay that way. Not compromising any of our personal relationships over our choice. If they choose to follow suit that's great, if not, oh well, all we can do is politely inform and set the example. Neither of us are a fan of being radical. You can't force someone to do something they don't wanna do. Call us neutral all you want  #129335;</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Well I'm not sure, but I'll tell you what I know! Coincidentally, I'm a woman who has a diagnosed hormonal disorder called PCOS. The reason I turned to veganism in the first place, (well actually, I started out cutting out dairy because it had the strongest effects on me) was to manage this condition. Dairy and meat have a lot of hormones in them, which really throws my body out of balance. I have to take supplements to manage this or else my period actually goes away, I get severe cystic acne, and hair hair grows all over my jawline. So as someone who has really seen the negative effects dairy can cause on my body, I guess I now see it that way. I think some of it is also because most adults are actually lactose intolerant as well, so we're not even really meant to be digesting it. What happens if you stop drinking it?</TEXT>

    <TEXT>It seems to me like they view anyone who isn't militant or considers themselves an activist "too neutral" I proudly said that I would not compromise relationships with non vegan people I care about in my life by trying to force my lifestyle onto them, and apparently that was a huge no no. As for why your body seems to have a bit of a reliance on milk, I'm not sure. Is it all dairy or just the milk? In my opinion it's probably not good to have a reliance on any food item regardless of what type. I used to rely on caffeine and sugar and would feel like shit without them, but I slowly weaned myself off of them and I feel much better.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I just don't think the focus should be on what percentage the person is doing it for the animals vs their health or any other reason. As long as it is one of the reasons, people need to stop gate keeping about who's a "true vegan". If it truly is about the animals, people on r/vegan need to stop treating it like it's some exclusive cool people club where they berate anyone who they don't see as perfect.</TEXT>

And I said you're condescending because it constantly feels like you're lecturing people. I would never insult a non English speaker, I live in Europe and work and am friends with many people who are not native English speakers, I just thought maybe there was a translation issue I wasn't seeing that would explain your lecturing me, but it had nothing to do with the language barrier.</TEXT>

I had my attachments put on right before my ortho snapped my aligners on, so they were still a bit sore from that 3.

I already feel a bit better after reading some suggestions here about drinking lots of cold water and removing them as little and as gently as possible. Mine are super hard to remove, especially the top, so I just ordered an orthokey. I noticed the longer I have them in the less they hurt, and the time when I snap them back in after eating a meal is when they hurt the most, so I'm trying to prolong the distance between meals as much as possible. I definitely have a bit of a lisp but my husband thinks it's cute and that's the least of my worries right now when it feels like someone's taken a hammer to my two front teeth  #128557;</TEXT>

    <TEXT>That's so not true about dressing your age being boring, I'm about to head into my thirties and have way more fun pieces and better color variety in my closet than I did in my teens/early twenties! I think the major difference in what I mean by "dressing for your age" is wearing what you personally truly like vs. only what is trendy or what influencers are wearing. I totally agree about the makeup aging as well. I'm a huge advocate for wearing makeup to empower yourself and I wear it on a daily basis but sometimes I feel like I can literally SEE someone's insecurities on their makeup/filters/procedures if that makes sense.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>So this isn't really an answer to the question, but an interesting situation nonetheless. When the 2016 election was happening, I had just moved to the UK from Washington state to be with my British husband as he was unable to get a US visa at the time so I came here instead. Now we are debating buying a home in the US as they are more affordable there, and my family is there, however there are many things holding us back, free healthcare, less turbulent political circumstances, the cities here aren't going to complete shit etc. I love my country and I want to move back , as does my husband, but these are weird times. Maybe we should wait until after the election?</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I feel really strange. Within the span of the last decade, one by one each of the people who bullied me in school has met an untimely and tragic demise. I am 28 now and have obviously forgiven people who have done me wrong in the past, but I don't forget. The girl who bullied me the most in middle school just got into a car accident with her husband and 2 sons under the age of 5, all of them passed away. My best friend in elementary school who stopped hanging out and started ignoring me once the popular girls accepted her got into a car crash and died. One of the girls who bullied me severely now has cancer. At first it felt like a coincidence, but now it's getting more noticeable. Also, I know for a fact they bullied a lot more people than just me. I don't know if karma works that way, but damn.</TEXT>

So maybe there's underlying tones of misogyny where the guys turn to objectifying the women when they feel frustrated, and they would rather have them as autonomous beings that look like themselves and have the same characteristics but no free will. So more like love slaves. So the app is like a training program turning Lara into this love slave, slowly removing her free will by having her follow the instructions given like burning the money etc. And her feeling "seen" is her slowly wamting to give control amd free will over because it feels good.

I've never understood this one or the other notion. Just do all the things you like to do.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Hi everyone, update!!!! I just switched to tray set 2 and it is sooo much better than tray 1! I mean there's a bit of normal tightness and discomfort, but nothing like the hellish experience of tray one. I'm now 100% it was because I had just had the attachments put on. So anyone who hasn't had theirs yet and thinks it's all smooth sailing... Just wait. Lol glad I got it out of the way instead of halfway through or something. And to those going through what I went through (popping paracetemol to the max dosage and missing sleep) stick it through, I promise the nightmare will end!</TEXT>

    <TEXT>But every time I order a vegan takeaway it gets messed up, one way or another! Today they not only included huge slabs of goat cheese, but threw in a chocolate milk instead of the drink I ordered for good measure. This is the 5th time in the last 3 months my husband and I have received the wrong food from various restaurants. Is this a vegan thing or just an overall thing? I've only been vegan for about 6 months now so it feels like I'm just beginning to notice certain things.</TEXT>

What I'm not happy about is that I keep getting emails from them about sexism, racism and other hot topics while they never address their part in the dairy industry. It just rubs me the wrong way when companies who aren't perfect wanna get all social justice on my ass. Cruelty is still cruelty y'all!</TEXT>

    <TEXT>No not at all! There's no such thing as a perfect human being, and human beings make up companies sooo... But I think it's possible to be more transparent and less hypocritical! Their "Caring Dairy" thing rubs me the wrong way. https://www.benjerry.co.uk/values/how-we-do-business/caring-dairy They've lost lawsuits that have proven they still sourced their dairy from factory farms but were trying to make it seem ethical. It honestly pisses me off less if a company is open about it's sourcing from factory farms than if they do it and then try to make it seem "cruelty free". I hate liars.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I mean at the end of the day they're like any other company that uses it's image to sell a product. The even more annoying part is that they've obviously noticed every other company doing the same thing recently so they've really upped the ante recently to the point where they've become insufferable. Almost as if to say, "we were social justice warriors first! all these other companies are such pooooosers." But yeah I can definitely have pictured that in the 90's and they've probably done everything possible to bury it.</TEXT>
