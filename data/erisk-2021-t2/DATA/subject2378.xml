    <TITLE>Me [25M] with my [25F] girl of 3 months and the man she loves. Please help.</TITLE>
    <DATE>2014-09-17 18:23:12</DATE>
    <TEXT>So, I've been seeing this girl for about 3 months, and things have been going really well. It started casual, but I did develop more romantic feelings for her, when today she told me that her heart isn't in it because she's in love with someone else and has been since before we started dating. She used the phrasing "You seemed like a nice guy to move on with". The problem is that the guy is married, with child, and a lecturer at her department. He is also manipulative and there is talk of a pending investigation because he's been abusing his authority/power/position to do this other girls as well. Oh, and that I've had feelings for her for a while now and this is actually our 4th semi-abortive attempt at dating in about a year. Naturally, I was rather upset. I have calmed down in the mean time and decided that I'm a) not ready to dissolve the relationship (it's sort of in limbo since then) and b) I don't think I could leave her (or anyone) alone in such a situation. This is further complicated by the fact that she suffers from depression/bi-polar and has been on the brink of suicide for the past two weeks. I do feel like I've been used and dehumanised into something akin to an emotional suppository. And while she says they broke it off before (or as) we started dating (which I believe), I am not convinced that they did not have sex - which for some reason I'm struggling to make peace with. I'm not sure what to do here. I don't know whether I could quite live with the guilt of abandoning her in such a shitty situation (there is a pending investigation - and naturally she's being blamed as the evil seductress). Lastly, she has said that she likes me, quite a bit - which I'm inclined to believe, but I'm also worried she might (knowingly or not) be saying this to keep me around to further play the role of emotional support. P.S., I got the "you're such a nice guy" speech. --- **tl;dr**: She's in love with a manipulative authority figure and I don't want to end it just let. Please advise. [EDIT]: Thanks for the responses everyone. I think I'll have to cut ties with her. Y'all really helped me see get out of my head.</TEXT>

    <TITLE>Is 9gag the neckbeard nexus?</TITLE>

    <TEXT>Every now and then 9gag has a thing or two that I lol at, but recently it seems to have become a repository of various neckbeardly things. What's up with that? You can't scroll more than 5 posts without someone talking about douchebags vs. NiceGuys(tm) or GentleMen(tm), or about their favourite waifu. Even the Emma Watson obsession is getting pathetic when there are posts about how the only thing to look forward to in 2015 is getting to see her nude. Or is it just me? It can't be.</TEXT>

    <TITLE>Game with friends only</TITLE>
    <DATE>2015-06-30 06:16:24</DATE>
    <TEXT>Hi, apologies if someone asked this before. My friends and I live in South Africa where we have terrible international speeds and passable local ones (it took me roughly 14hrs to download Ark via Steam). I'm also very new to this type of game, but I love it (judging by the 30 minutes I played before work). Anyway, how do I create a game for my friends only? I tried hosting a server, but it closed the game and brought up some DOS dialogue, disallowing me to play the game. Is this the only way? We aren't able to be in-game for more than an hour a day due to our schedules, so any PvP would just be terrible for us. Is PvE an option? Joining a tribe would be problematic because of our schedules and terrible latency. Thanks in advance</TEXT>

    <DATE>2017-02-16 09:37:27</DATE>
    <TEXT>I'm just wondering whether there's a chance of seeing tanks from the South African army in game at some point? I think we have some wonderful machines (Eland, Ratel, Rooikat) that would be fun to play in game. They're mostly lightly-armored, maneuverable all-terrain vehicles that would shine on desert and jungle maps (since they were built with rough terrain in mind). Plus they have lovely weaponry (the Eland has a 90mm cannon and a 60mm mortar). I know some of these are only 70s or 80s onwards, but I can dream, can't I?</TEXT>

    <TITLE>How to play Leo 1: a noob's guide</TITLE>
    <DATE>2017-03-05 09:55:35</DATE>
    <TEXT>I thought this might come in handy. I am still very much a novice Leo player however, 90% of games I see people (including me) worried about the Leo 1 performance vs. (specifically) Russian tanks. So from a novice Leo player to other novices, here are some things I learned. 1) Don't bother with AB. I found RB to be far better suited to the Leo since you can actually hide. 2) Find a spot and wait. I spend most of my games waiting. Coming from 6.7 monsters like the II (H) and the Panther II you're used to being able to tank a few shots and then OHK enemy tanks. The Leo is a completely different animal. 3) APDS is meant for enemy turret rings. Especially T10M and T62. If you get a hit, you're likely to cripple them. 4) I wouldn't bother with the repair kit at first. I found that if something hits you, you die. Being able to turn my turret faster would have saved my life more than sitting for a minute on a repair. 5) Don't shoot the T10M into the side. They've got some weird suspension modeling going on there that just eats your shots. 6) HESH is made for ZSU 57. 7) Don't be seen. Your greatest strength is not being seen. 8) Learn to shoot with binoculars. 9) Know your tanks. US tanks get popped nicely by that big ammo rack next to the driver. UK tanks need to be shot in the left (from the front). USSR tanks need to be hit in the ring, or sometimes they have these middle-section driver hatches (IS4 I think has a nice one) that are 80% of the time an OHK. 10) Learn patience. If you think it's time to move, rather wait another minute. 11) Listen to your surroundings. You can often hear tanks trying to flank before you see them. 12) Beware your two antennae. They will give your position away. 13) Use your mg only when necessary. Those bright-red laser beams will give your position away. 14) Shoot 'n scoot. If your first shot did nothing, run away. 15) When facing IT1, keep moving. Works best when you have distance. Close range is trickier. I found that showing them my side or rear is less likely to get me killed than getting shot from the front. 16) Speaking of the IT1; don't bother shooting the missile or missile mount. APDS and HESH do basically nothing. Turret rings are unrealiable. Try going for the optics cluster on the left (facing you). Or the driver sights on the right. Ideally, run away. If some of these are repetition it's probably because they deserve to be mentioned twice. Please leave any other advice you might have :) Happy hunting!</TEXT>

    <TITLE>Damage Model Confusion</TITLE>
    <DATE>2017-03-23 06:06:16</DATE>
    <TEXT>Hi all, So recently something strange has been happening more and more often to me in  gt;8.0 RB. I would intentionally or accidentally take out someone's breach or barrel or hor. drive (to the point where it goes completely black on the damage indicator) only for them to turn and pop me. Is there something I'm missing about the damage model? I thought that if you blacked something out it's non-functional. This seems to be relatively new since I can't remember it being this bad a few months ago. If it's a change to the damage model or something I'm misunderstanding I'd like to know so I can try and adjust my play style. Note: This is true for my Panther II, Leo 1A0, and RakJpz 2.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>So, our current living situation doesn't allow for installing solar geysers or even entire panels (living in a complex with a stingy board - plus I'd prefer they fix the foundations before doing solar). We have a balcony that sees decent daylight and I was wondering whether there are any ideas on small-scale/mobile solar stations/supplements? Even if it's just enough to keep phones/laptops charged or to keep the router or TV running. Nothing too over the top and preferably something I can DIY. Thanks in advance.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Hello, and thank you in advance. I'm busy writing up a thesis and am getting tired of writing "see figure \ref{fig:xyz}". Is there a way to have the cross-referencing commands automatically include the appropriate component? For example, if I use \ref{fig:xyz} it gives me "figure xyz" instead of just "xyz"? I'm sure there are commands to tweak this, however my knowledge of the inner workings of LaTeX is limited. EDIT: thank you /u/Firebrazer and /u/zzorgzz, cleveref was what I was looking for!</TEXT>

    <TITLE>Excluding smaller cluster sizes from FindClusters</TITLE>
    <DATE>2019-09-23 09:54:19</DATE>
    <TEXT>Hi All, I have a set of clustered data with a lot of background noise - in this case I have generated both with RandomReal in 2D space. The idea is to transition to my actual data in 3D space, but I'm optimising in 2D space, with limited numbers of points first. I'm using FindClusters with Agglomerate and SquaredEuclideanDistance as Method and DistanceFunction respectively. However, while this does find the clusters I want and it does ignore a lot of the noise, it does find smaller 2 - 5 member clusters in the noise. I would like to know how to best exclude these smaller clusters - i.e. consign them to the noise. I have a measure by which to "score" the clusters by taking their length and dividing by the total variance: `Length[#]/Total[Variance[#]]`. Could this be used to exclude clusters? I still struggle writing functions, so any help would be greatly appreciated. Thanks in advance.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Thanks in advance: I'm looking for a publicly available data set for SA COVID stats. I'm currently using the one from the ECDC, but it only tracks cases and deaths for the country. If anyone can point me to an SA set that contains tests, recoveries, and a provincial breakdown that would be amazing. Preferably a URL that points to an excel/csv file. I just don't see myself punching in all that data by hand. I'll post if I manage to do something interesting with the data.</TEXT>

    <TEXT> gt;I grew up being taught the definition of racism was: hating someone because they belonged to a race that you hate or dislike. And discriminating for or against someone by virtue of their race.  gt;That was what I understood racism to be. And now that understanding is apparently "outdated"  gt;Same with sexism. I was taught that sexism was hating or discriminating for or against someone by virtue of their sex. Those are still definitions of racism - MW doesn't use 'hatred' I guess, but prejudice and discrimination still fit the bill. The fact that they've expanded it to include systemic oppression/racism (i.e. EFF or BBEEE) should make you happy, no? As for the belief "that race is the primary determinant of human traits and capacities and that racial differences produce an inherent superiority of a particular race" That's the philosophy many dictators built their empires on. So, what part of this are you actually upset about?</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Definition #1 for discrimination in Merriam-Webster *prejudiced or prejudicial outlook, action, or treatment* But also, isn't it super weird how context determines the meaning of phrases and words? It's like how "plane" means a flat surface, but if I say airplane it means "a powered flying vehicle with fixed wings and a weight greater than that of the air it displaces; an aeroplane." Or how you can bank on the bank being in front of the bank at the river bank. Same word, four different meanings. Or how you can pick cherries or cherry-pick - super weird how words' meanings change depending on context.</TEXT>

    <TEXT> gt;For example the idea from extreme left "intellectuals" that "black people can't be racist" really disillusions me because it smacks of irrational logic. It just does not make logical sense. Engage your critical faculties. This is an American thing and they're using the definition of "systemic" racism (definition #2). Since most of the power and wealth in the US are concentrated with white people, black people don't have the same ability to be *systemically* racist as white people (in the US). Obviously, if you put racist black people into positions of power, this will change. SA has a different demographic make up - BBBEE, the EFF, SAPS, and SANDF clearly exhibit systemic racism. As for on a *personal* level whether black people can be prejudiced against people of other races, that's obviously true. If it weren't, SA wouldn't have a xenophobia issue for starters. Also, black supremacy organisations are clearly racist. This would be referring to definition #1 and #3.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>People like importing US social justice without critically thinking about it. Reality is far more nuanced and different than what social media and tabloids want us to believe. Political power and the capacity for systemic racism on that front rests primarily with the ANC. However economic power is still *disproportionately* white. Acknowledging the one doesn't mean you're blind to the other. Fighting all forms of racism/sexism should be our goal, MW just gave us more ways to express it. It's pointless to have one racist system replace another.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Everything you said is covered by my use of the word "disproportionately". Let's take dollar billionaires as an example: SA currently [has five](https://businesstech.co.za/news/wealth/327059/here-are-24-of-the-richest-people-in-south-africa/). Four of these five are white. This means by current population numbers, there is one black dollar billionaire for every 45 million black people and one white dollar billionaire for every 1.3 million white people. If we take the "6 million" number at face value - which, given that fewer than 5 million South Africans submitted tax returns seems dubious. Even then, despite the fact that the black middle class is larger than the white middle class, it only accounts for less than 15% of the total black population. [This](https://businesstech.co.za/news/finance/260943/3-graphs-that-show-what-south-africas-middle-class-looks-like/) for example shows that 50% of the SA middle class is black and 28% of it is white. That means 9.1% of the SA population makes up 28% of its middle class and 57% of the elite and seemingly less than 2% of the poor - at least by 2014 numbers. I don't know what the current figures are - everything seems to rely on "self-reported" numbers which I am loathe to trust. I expect it's changed somewhat, but is unlikely to be proportional to SA's population.</TEXT>

Most liberals are unlikely to be communists. There are just concepts in communism that are relevant to current politics - the plight of the worker being one. Most are also unlikely to be full-blown socialists, preferring instead a social democracy/democratic socialism.

    <TEXT> gt;Yes, that describes my personal point of view to a t. I want the freedom to live my life the way I see fit, social support for those who need it, equality for all, nonracialism, to provide a good life for my family and perhaps have the means and freedom to travel the world a bit. I really feel that our economy is in dire straits and needs to seriously grow soon and we need some fiscal discipline to get our  #8220;house #8221; in order. I think fundamentally our issues are not of an economic or fiscal nature. Personally, I believe these to be symptoms of a much larger issue. Our democracy and our institutions are too vulnerable to rot and corruption. We have some of the best legislation and policy in the world - not just our constitution. But none of that matters if people - especially those who are supposed to apply the laws and policies - don't *believe* in the democratic project. Decades of neoliberalism, spurred by racial resentment and suspicion have ingrained in us a kind of "fuck you, I got mine" mentality. We've conflated being rich with being successful. It stands to reason then that the people in power prefer being rich to being just - which leads us to things like corruption. The corrupt don't hate SA - they're just narcissists who think their own personal success (wealth) matters more. I don't have time or space to go into as much detail as I'd like to on this, but I think one solution might be revamping education. We've emphasised applied fields to the detriment of conceptual ones. A STEM degree isn't going to teach us the value of democracy, how our government is structured, the purpose of public participation, etc. etc. There's no reason that high-school education can't include a module on civics or philosophy - same goes for university. It's bizarre to me that most science courses do not include a philosophy of science module. Change is happening though - I know at Stellenbosch the engineers have to take a "social impact" module or something. It's apparently been quite successful, but I don't have first-hand experience with it.  gt;However, it often feels as if many are pushing for full blown communism or at least policies that harm the country in the long run even though it may appeal to the masses in the short term, which in turn (based on my reading and research so far) does not seem sustainable, practical or free in any sense. I will go with Malema as an example here. You have to keep in mind that, fundamentally, these people are political creatures. They want votes and the poor are SA's largest voting bloc. If you're living hand-to-mouth then you'll vote for the guy who offers immediate solutions rather than waffling on about offering civics modules in school. What kid is gonna give a shit about the purpose of a democracy on an empty stomach or if they're menstruating and unable to afford hygiene products or if they're being targeted by gangs? This brings me to my second point - tackling *one* system at a time is futile. SA society is broken. Poverty, homelessness, violence, food insecurity, educational outcomes, etc. etc. are interconnected. You cannot attempt to solve one problem without doing so for others. This is where we need greater buy-in from administrators, bureaucrats, and leadership - they need to see the value in educating themselves, traveling to other countries, learning - literally, searching for solutions and then they need to be given the autonomy to implement them. I think just opening the market will only benefit those who are already poised to participate in it - those with wealth and education. The miner, labourer, or farmworker will be left behind.  gt;It worries me because our inequality will never decrease with we don #8217;t adopt market friendly policies and actually grow the economy in this increasingly globalized world. A lot of this I think is covered by the above, but I absolutely agree with you. However, SA must also keep abreast of what the market wants. Lower wages in an environment of increasing costs of living just aren't feasible. Deregulation of environmental policies are also something to be wary of. By and large the market values profit and efficiency instead of value and robustness.  gt;I have also read that socialism/communism (not social support) and democracy are incompatible by definition. What are your thoughts on this? Thanks for always engaging in such a cool and accommodating way btw I think anything that concentrates power (communism) or wealth (neoliberal capitalism) with just the few is incompatible with a democracy. For me, government is supposed to be large, unwieldy, and bureaucratic. You don't want government to have profit as its motive. Most strong democracies (e.g. the EU), have immense governments. That's not to say that government should interfere in the minutiae of our personal lives which - by and large - these governments don't do. European governments allow significantly more personal freedoms than the US does - the latter, ironically, touting the freedom and personal liberty of small government, but regulates things like alcohol, drugs, abortion, sex, and sexuality more severely than other developed nations. If you've reached this point, thank you for reading. I tried to express as clearly as possible what I think, but I fear the end product might be a bit clumsy in the end. It's late now though. Thanks for the chat.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Most of the cars I've bought were 2nd hand and I usually got very good deals on them. '97 Audi A4 - 35,000km and in good condition: R45k. '02 VW Passat (2.8L V6) - 60,000km, needed new tires and a good clean: R35k. '07 Ford Fiesta - 50,000km, needed minor body work and new tires: R40k (came to about R48k after the work was done). I tend to go for cars where the previous owner was an old(er) lady or someone who's owned the car for years but has put less than 5,000 km a year on to it. Full service history is a must. I also don't buy anything where I can't do minor/moderate work (brakes, suspension, radiator, etc.) on it myself or where spares are a pain to get a hold of.

    <TEXT>As far as I'm aware the national backlog has been mostly cleared. Certainly the WC reports that our backlog has been cleared [\[1\]](https://www.news24.com/news24/southafrica/news/western-cape-clears-covid-19-testing-backlog-but-cases-expected-to-peak-before-end-of-june-20200618). Similarly, it's unlikely that we're testing samples from more than a few days ago. As far as I'm aware the samples degrade quite rapidly meaning any result after 48 hours becomes increasingly unreliable. I would wager, at most, the results are between two and four days out of sync. Most people I've spoken to and who shared their testimonials on this sub also indicate a 2 to 3 day turnaround before they get their results. There are of course people who waited two weeks or more for their results, but I can't say whether that reflects the time it took to test their sample or just the time it took to inform them of the result.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Go to the relevant municipal court and make representations - essentially your argument for why you can't pay the fine. Be contrite, be humble, assure them you'll make the changes, tell them you're out of money. You'll probably be able to get the fine reduced. As far as whether it's a legitimate fine, unfortunately yes. Pets need to be kept behind netting on the back seat or in special pet seats on the front seat that keeps them restrained. Even if that's not the reason the traffic cop stopped you originally (the can stop you for whatever reason they want), they can still fine you for it. Source: same thing happened to me when I took my cat home from the welfare without a cat box. Fine got reduced to 400 rand.</TEXT>

    <TEXT> gt;Setting aside the obvious ethnic and linguistic differences, the people of the Cape have distinctly different ideological beliefs, with 67% favouring capitalist parties, while 73% of the remainder of South Africa favour broadly socialist parties. Given that independent experts almost unanimously agree that most of South Africa #8217;s economic and social woes are either caused, or exacerbated, by socialist and race-based policy, this is no small matter. Interesting to me how these numbers have no sources and these independent experts have no names. This article was a masterclass in framing the argument on their own terms. He begins by framing himself as rational, open-minded, and informed - while detractors are the opposite. He then proceeds to deal with detractors along the lines of "I'm more than willing to acknowledge rational arguments against this, I just haven't heard any." or "This is good for the poor, do you hate the poor?". But worst of all, he doesn't actually *say* anything. The entire article can be summed up with this:  gt;Accountable government, genuine democracy, increased economic prosperity and ultimately the eradication of poverty make for quite a compelling argument in favour of independence. How is that different to what we've been hearing for the last 30 years? There's nothing concrete about what their plans are. He just blue-balls us with this:  gt;Much more could be written about the practicalities of independence, but at this stage it seems wise to limit the discussion to the actual merits of independence itself in the hope of drawing out an equally focused rebuttal from its opponents. He's asking people to argue against points he hasn't made. I could just as well say "I have a plan to cure cancer, cancer is bad and curing cancer is good, I hope for an equally focused rebuttal.". That's not an argument. That's an irritation. You either put yourself in the position where you sound like you're pro-cancer or you get pissed off at this guy. Either way he leans back, smirks, and declares victory over the irrational masses.</TEXT>

    <TEXT> gt;The market and market incentives have existed for as long as and longer than humanity, the concepts apply even to animals. They are not man-made and are independent of what man does or doesn't do. That's just simply not true.  gt;I'm also making the assumption that both you and Axe agree that the concept of private property is necessary and beneficial, and so I'm using it as an axiom for the purpose of the argument. If you disagree with this (and let's be honest, you don't), then my argument doesn't apply. I actually disagree. You're confusing what is with what could or what ought to be. There are plenty examples of private property being neither necessary nor particularly beneficial. Also, it must be easy "winning" all the arguments when you engage in the trickery of reframing, redefining, or rewording arguments to serve your own needs.  gt;On the other hand, I don't agree that The European Convention on Human Rights is a legitimate authority on what our rights are or aren't, and I have outlined an argument as well as an example of why I hold this view. Of course, you can reject my argument because you are not willing to argue without holding that as an axiom, and then we have nowhere to go but to agree to disagree. Because inherently humans have no rights. There is nothing writ in laws of nature that decree we have rights to property, life, or the market. If we have no rights, we have no right to market participation or property either. Your whole argument rests on human convention being meaningless, which makes all your waffle about property and the market equally meaningless by the same token.</TEXT>

    <TEXT> gt;Maybe this is a question of definition. I believe creatures have desires. I believe they do what they think will best satisfy those desires. The interactions between creatures that result from both trying to satisfy their own desires is what I consider the most basic form of the market. Obviously, this becomes an extremely complicated concept in the context of human interaction, but I'm only defending the usefulness of the concept here, not its various possible applications. Yeah I figured you'd go with an overbroad definition of what a market it. Of course, you also run into the problem here that the concept of "desire" is human in nature. We can just redefine it as impulses or stimuli or whatever. In fact, "desire satisfaction" underlying the need for a market is another human convention. The fact that you overlay "market" on anything and everything just weakens the concept of a market entirely.  gt;A wild strawman appeared! Not really. I just said that there were plenty examples of property not being necessary or beneficial.  gt;I didn't say private properly was universally beneficial regardless of surrounding circumstances. The full relevant assumption, which I left out because I assumed you were intellectually honest enough to fill in the blanks, is It's a clever trick, reframing me as intellectually dishonest when all you've done is make vague assertions about human convention and then hand-wave that away by using overbroad definitions of what a market is.  gt;In the modern world, as long as the property was legitimately acquired (and we can go into what that means too if you really just want to distract from the point by any means necessary), it is desirable to protect people's right to do with their property what they want as long as it doesn't harm anyone else (yes, you can argue that breeding animals for slaughter harms other people, that's the whole debate here, but it's not part of the basic assumption). But here you are now drawing an arbitrary distinction between humans and animals. Previously you made the point that animals are active market participants, but now they are property? You're also engaging with "it is desirable" without actually telling me why.  gt;Trying to win the argument is only a secondary objective for me, my primary objective is that I (and you) should leave the discussion with the most "correct" point of view possible Considering how you're arguing, this is also not true.  gt;That's precisely why I don't engage in this kind of trickery, but of course a trickster will see tricks in everything. Ah, the "it takes one to know one" defense. Well, sir, I counter with the "no u" offensive. En garde!  gt;100% agree. That's why my argument is invalid if you don't agree that property rights are beneficial, and why your argument is invalid if I don't agree that The European Convention on Human Rights is an authority on rights. I have no truck with that convention.  gt;Human convention is inherently meaningless, but that doesn't mean that we can't agree that it's meaningful for our purposes and then work from that basis. Absolutely it does if the only conventions we have to agree with are yours.  gt;The European Convention on Human Rights, despite the name, is not a reflection of human convention. It is not the equivalent of the English language, where we will all accept that words mean what they mean if we're not being disingenuous. Plenty of people, probably most (I am one) do not hold the exact set of views expressed by The European Convention on Human Rights, so it is not comparable. I'm not trying to pass my basic argument off as a point of fact the way you're trying to do with their definition of property rights. This is a fun point you're making. Because you're essentially invalidating your initial, overbroad definition of "market". Neither Mirriam Webster nor OED support your "desire fulfillment in animals" definition.</TEXT>

    <TEXT> gt;The concept of a market as I defined it perfectly covers the way I used the word in my original argument. If you want to use a different definition, give me your definition and explain why the existence of what you define as a market is a necessary assumption in my argument. Yes. As *you* defined it. I can also run around defining things to suit my aims. By using "market", I'm using the general, most commonly used interpretation relating to commerce and the exchange of goods. Not "I'm thirsty and I want to satisfy this desire by drinking water.". I didn't define the market as necessary. Your entire argument rests on the assumption that it is.  gt;Right, so you made an argument against a claim I didn't make. I agree with you, and it's not relevant, so move on. You made an argument that it is necessary. I said not always - which defeats the point of something being "necessary".  gt;In addition, here is an assumption you're making, which I disagree with (namely that the European Convention on Human Rights is a legitimate authority on what our rights are). You can justify it, or you can tell me you assume I believe it and have no argument otherwise (as I've done with the assumption of the value of private property), and then once again, we have nowhere to go Really don't know what stuck in your craw about human rights, but I made no claims to the validity or lack thereof of this body. You're arguing against yourself here.  gt;Then you agree with me that it's a bad argument that people should control what others do with their property (animals) for the sake of the general interest, which is the only point I was making, so why are you arguing with me in the first place? I do not agree with that. I don't see how you arrived at that conclusion. I, for example, don't think people should torture or fuck their pets.  gt; I would also point out, for what it's worth, that the vast majority of people would agree, so I'm not the one being unreasonable here. Ah, the "other people think like me, therefore I'm not wrong" argument.  gt;We can argue about the definition of market, but if we start arguing about the definition of "the" and "is" (basically, if we can't agree on the definitions of the set of words we need in order to reach an agreement on the definition of words in the first place) then the conversation becomes meaningless. Something something men and straw  gt;You're actually illustrating my point by referring to Mirriam Webster or OED, because I'd be the first person to say that if you disagree with the definition of a specific word there, we should instead try to reach an agreement on the definition, because dictionaries are not the ultimate authority on the meanings of words in the same way that the ECHR is not the ultimate authority on the rights of people. Insofar as people would say you're being unreasonable if you don't accept a dictionary definition, it is because the specific dictionary definition in question is one of a word which is almost universally agreed upon in meaning already. You *just* used consensus to justify your beliefs, but now you want to argue on the widely accepted meanings of words?  gt;It's clear that you're not interested in having a mature discussion about the actual issue here, but rather just trying to obfuscate it and turn it into a debate about garbage. If you can't make an argument in good faith, then I'm not interested in discussing this further. Your entire argument rests on the assumption that the human constructs of the market and property (and property rights) are inalienable and have existed since the dawn of time but that (for some reason) human rights aren't. Everything is a recent convention except for the things you believe. You try to hide it by *seeming* reasonable, but the fact of the matter is that when pressed for something concrete, you turn to obfuscation, extremely broad definitions, and the ol' "I'm just making implicit assumptions" among other things. They're clever bits of rhetoric. By not providing a solid definition of what a market is, and making me define it, you're able to much more easily form a counter argument. Similarly, by making "implicit assumptions" you're arguing with yourself, not me. There is zero reason to believe that we have the same set of assumptions regarding this matter. And, of course, the whole "I'm good faith trying to find the truth and the correct argument" narrative while offering to bow out if I don't agree with your base assumptions is also a fun bit of rhetoric. The only concrete thing you've said so far is that "people should do with their property whatever they want and I disagree with human rights.". I'm not arguing with you based on those assertions, I'm arguing against the logic that underpins them.  gt;You're assuming here that being an active market participant (by my definition of market) and being property are mutually exclusive, and I disagree. If you're going to say that, then justify it. Sounds like someone is able to justify slavery. Personally, I think slavery is wrong.  gt;I already told you, as you would know if you actually bothered paying attention to what I said instead of thinking about how you can better cloud the issue, that I am not trying to convince you that it's desirable, I am taking it as a base assumption which I am offering to you as something you can agree or disagree with, while pointing out that if you do not agree, then I have no argument. I can make any number of assumptions without justifying them. I don't see how you think that's a good faith way of engaging. I either agree with you or you bow out of the conversation. How does *that* serve your desire of finding "the most correct" argument? The reason it may seem "cloudy" to you is because this concept may slightly more complex than "I should get to own a living being and do with it what I want and I don't agree with human rights."</TEXT>

    <TEXT> gt;Wow. I suppose you aren't a drinker and/or smoker. You can suppose all you want.  gt;So arbitrary rules in their favor are better than ones that aren't - which was my point. So, on balance, you're in favour of arbitrary rules that lead to profit instead of those that preserve life or medical resources?  gt;There are various articles online where restaurant owners are interviewed and they state outright that their business model does not work without the sale of on-consumption liquor. If you could provide some links, that would be good. But I'd question the business model where their profit stems from the sale of a single good. Are they making a loss each time I order a pizza and not a glass of wine? How do Halaal restaurants manage then?  gt;The point of driving drunk being illegal is irrelevant to the point I was making. The point was that if they are going to break the law and drive drunk, there is no reason to believe they would be more or less likely to drive drunk to and/or from a restaurant - making it a non-issue and hence the stupidity of the prohibition. Most crimes are opportunistic in nature. Few people *plan* to get drunk and then go driving. But if you're at a restaurant and you end up getting drunk, many people will still decide to drive home while drunk.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>NAL: but as far as I understood it, government only had to overcome the extremely low bar of "is this rationally connected to the current state of disaster?". Which is very easy to do. Smoking causes lung disease, COVID is a disease which attacks the lung. Government, afaik, did not have to show *how* or *to what degree* they are connected, only that they *are* connected. FITA's argument, while having a higher bar to overcome, was nonetheless weak. They tried arguing that tobacco is essential due to its addictive nature. No court is going to want to set precedent on classifying addictive substances as essential. Then they argued that it's a question of choice. However, considering that government can, under the DMA, restrict much more fundamental rights (e.g. assembly) I don't see how that argument would fly either. Even under non-disaster conditions we accept that our choices (on what to buy) are limited by various regulations and the constitution. It might be a technicality, but *smoking* is not illegal. Selling cigarettes is. Which is, I think, why it's so hard to challenge this regulation. As far as I can see, FITA did *not* bring an argument regarding the economic and employment consequences of banning the sale of cigarettes.  gt; Is there any sense in further pursuing cases? Absolutely, yes. Every regulation needs to be challenged and transparency asserted and public participation encouraged.</TEXT>

    <TEXT> gt;There's also a lot of bad science that got pushed through because we were desperate. This is very concerning, and mostly so because the 24 hour news cycle just runs with stuff. It's an unfortunate mix of news corps having discovered Rxiv sites, universities having PR offices, and people (journalists and the public) not having the skills to interpret science properly. I'm considering reworking my link strategy. Both r/science and r/coronavirus are just overfull of CNN and Daily Mail articles.

    <TEXT>I think there's about a 10 to 14 day delay between confirmed infection and death/recovery. We will probably only see the aftereffects of this rise in infections towards the end of next week. I don't know how we record COVID deaths, but I see no reason to believe that we are under-reporting these deaths. It's likely just the delay in how the disease progresses, testing, and how the data is captured. But there are also other factors to consider: our population is younger which reduces the risk of mortality significantly. We've learned from other countries which interventions work (oxygen therapy, dexamethasone, ventilators, etc.) so we have a "knowledge advantage" that they didn't. Upwards of 70% of our population are vaccinated for BCG and MMR which is speculated to have protective effects against the worst of the COVID symptoms.</TEXT>
