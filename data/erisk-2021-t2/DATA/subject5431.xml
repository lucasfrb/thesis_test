    <TEXT>I have been level 10 on Athena for a long time before shores of gold came out. Not even a single takedown or enemy kill where just to screw other players. Since Shores of gold some them just said to me and others in my crew, "pls we are doing shores of gold mission dont kill us or whatever" we just leave and for example search pirates in raids, not f\*cking killing you, solding your skull and telling "say goobye to your shores of gold skull haha"</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Yeah, but what annoys me the most is not that they stole our skull, is that they knew what was it, that at least you have to spend 1h 30mins to complete the mission and they sold it for what, 3000 gold?</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Yesterday I was in a brig with a friend doing the first mission of shores of gold and a galleon strike on us. They took like some villainous bounty skull but not the artifact and then they gave it to us saying "right we keep the other stuff but heres the artifact, continue the missions"</TEXT>

    <TITLE>Battle For Neighborville or Garden Warfare 2 for PC?</TITLE>

    <TEXT>So I have been playing some GW2 with origin access time to time, last time in early 2019. With the launch of BFN I was very dissapointed and I wanted to wait some time in order to buy it or not. Now, in 2020 is still worth buying GW2 (which I know I will enjoy) but maybe low player base could be the worse part, or BFN has improve over these months and is now a viable buy? Thanks!</TEXT>

    <TITLE>Buy 5700XT or wait for 6000 series?</TITLE>
    <DATE>2020-10-19 10:36:12</DATE>
    <TEXT>Hi, I have been considering since a few weeks what to do. So, I have the money to buy the 5700XT, but in a week or so the presentation of the 6000 series is going to happen. The problem is that I have the money in the GAME wallet (GAME is sort of a GAMESTOP but here in Spain) (why do I have the money there? because I sold my second hand PS4 and I got the same money I spent buying it one year ago, and if I sell anything on GAME I have two options, to keep the money on the wallet or they give me the physical money but I lose 30% of the total price, so I obviously choosed keeeping the money on the wallet ), so that means I can just buy whatever is on the GAME shop. So, if I wait for the 6000 series and I see a graphic card that Id like to buy, first I must wait until the card comes available for buying, it has stock and most important, be available in the stock of GAME shop. So in total could be like a 2 month wait or more if there is not stock and in a few weeks, Cyberpunk, Assasins Creed, is coming out. So, what would you do? Thanks and sorry for bad english \^\^"</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Yeah, I have this problem basically for having the money on the GAME wallet because of what I said on the post, if I want want a 6000 series GPU I must wait for stock in the GAME shop and the GPU itself coming out, so it could be like a 2 month wait or so,however I wanted to hear some opinions, thxs anyways</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Ohhh, true, I haven #180;t though about that. I'm definitely gonna wait for the announcement, it's no sense buying it now since it can get cheaper and it's just 10 days. Thanks! :D</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Yep, my credit isn't going anywhere, but I'm mostly concerned about the stock of the actual 5700 xt, but I guess there is a great amount of stock (dont know really). I'm going to wait for the announcement as you say to make up my mind, but also as u/SandboChang told, 5700 xt could get cheaper. Thanks anyways :)</TEXT>
