    <TITLE>Water weight or fat?</TITLE>
    <DATE>2020-05-06 06:23:00</DATE>
    <TEXT>I've started to diet again after the shock of my life, I decided to jump on the scales in a friends bathroom.. 103 kg the highest weight I've ever been. I've always been fat but still I never imagined I would weigh over 100kg. I guess all the comfort food in winter cought up to me! So the same day I decided I would blow the dust off my fitness gear  amp; start a diet. Now here's the problem it's been 2 weeks  amp; I've lost 11kg (eating 800-1200 cal a day  amp; a very active job with workouts at home aswell) But I feel this is far too much for such little time  amp; my body looks exactly the same. I'm not expecting to be an Adonis over night but I thought 11kg would be enough to show some small progress on my body. So how to I know if I'm actually losing weight or if it's just water?</TEXT>

    <TITLE>2 months  amp; going strong!!</TITLE>
    <DATE>2020-06-03 14:46:58</DATE>
    <TEXT>So I posted here about 6 weeks ago at the start of my diet, I was so pleased I had kept it up for 2 weeks at the time. It was a major accomplishment for me to stop binge eating and start a healthier eating pattern. And today I realised it's been 2 months! I've lost 14kg so far ( pretty sure its mostly water, but still :D ) For context I've always struggled with my weight  amp; after going through a depressive episode I completely let myself go. I'd binge eat all day for lack of something better to do  amp; my self esteem completely fell apart To keep track of calories and not over do things I've been planning meals  amp; have stopped buying all the foods I binge. I hope I can post again in 2 months and still be on track! I just wanted to share my little accomplishment  amp; would love to hear about you guys triumphs  #9825;</TEXT>

    <TITLE>Best gory High fantasy books?</TITLE>
    <DATE>2020-06-24 10:37:00</DATE>
    <TEXT>I've been an avid reader since my childhood, but since reading asoiaf as a teenager my imagination was captivated by high fantasy. I've been trying to get back into reading and so far haven't really enjoyed anything that much. I've been looking for something gritty set in the middle ages with plenty of blood  amp; sex. I tried prince of thorns, and the once  amp; future king but couldn't really get into either of them. Was wondering if anyone had any good recommendations? For reference some of my favourite authors are Brandon Sanderson, garth nix (especially sabriel  amp; shades children!) ben Elton  amp; Irvine Welsh.</TEXT>

    <TITLE>TRPs cult like terminology for women.</TITLE>
    <DATE>2020-07-16 08:05:17</DATE>
    <TEXT>What I've noticed from interacting with terpers is they almost exclusively use language that dehumanises women when talking about them I.e "plate", whores, stacies ect. It's easier to treat someone bad if you use language that distances someone from their humanity. This is something incels do to a greater extent to justify legalising rape or murdering women, because to them women are just "foids" or "roasties". Nothing more than walking genitals, sub human if you will. It's not morally reprehensible to treat them like that because they aren't even people in their eyes. A similar phenomenon occurs in TRP but to a lesser extent, instead of murder  amp; rape its manipulation and lies. "Spinning plates" Doesn't sound half as bad as "manipulating women into thinking I'll commit so they sleep with me"</TEXT>

    <TITLE>Female sexuality  amp; horror cinema</TITLE>
    <DATE>2020-08-06 18:36:47</DATE>
    <TEXT>After being an avid horror fan since childhood I feel I have a pretty good understanding of the typical stereotypes and tropes. The one that irritates me the most are the female stereotypes surrounding womens sexuality. Theres the classic slasher girls, you know the ones.. only on screen to be brutally murdered after getting their breasts out. They're there to teach the lesson that promiscuous behaviour is to be punished and only the virginal "pure" girl makes it to the end and defeats the monsters. Sex sells, and if you #8217;re getting an R rating for gory violence, you may as well throw some gratuitous nudity in aswell. (its 90% female nudity) Then there's the seductive witch/temptress/supernatural non human woman who harms men and uses sex as a means to get what she wants. This stereotype is used to tarnish female sexuality as always having an ulterior motive for wanting sex I.e the alien in "under the skin", the alien girl in "species", the witch in "the vvitch". Their motives are usually to lure men in with sex to kill, eat or reproduce with them. Because for a male director  amp; assumed male audience a woman's sexuality is seen as a weapon to ensnare men for motives other than simply wanting sex. This is common place even in modern times when female sexuality has only barely been accepted for some 60 years or so. These stereotypes are very pervasive but in recent years there have been brilliant films that subvert the genre tropes brilliantly and depict women as more than objects of male desire/evil temptresses. Some of my favourites are the descent  amp; you're next. What are yours?</TEXT>

    <TITLE>Is it possible to lose fat but not weight?</TITLE>
    <DATE>2020-08-28 08:55:17</DATE>
    <TEXT>So I #8217;ve lost almost 30kg so far and am very close to my goal! (SW:103kg CW:75kg) Losing it was easier than maintaining! The first few weeks were hard, I #8217;m a binge eater so that #8217;s the biggest hurdle. I only did cico  amp; next to no exercise that I wasn #8217;t doing before. I ate around 1200-2000 zig zag over the week and so I was able to eat a bit extra on weekends  amp; still indulge my bar hopping habits. Took me around 6 months so I #8217;m trying to maintain for a while to stabilize my metabolism. Just got 7kg to go, but I #8217;ve been at a Plato for over a month now as I #8217;m working more towards maintaining. But although I #8217;ve not lost any weight my waist and hips are much smaller, so is the circumference of my thighs.( luckily I #8217;ve kept ma boobs so far!) I #8217;m definitely not any more muscular than I was before, I #8217;ve always had very muscular thighs  amp; chest due to the nature of my job. Was wondering how this is possible? And if anyone has similar experience?</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Women #8217;s sexuality just functions differently. I do think it #8217;s still not completely understood,as women tend to express it differently. As culture surrounding it becomes less critical  amp; more permissive we are seeing more and more women openly expressing it. Women do perhaps have a similar libido but express it in a much more passive way due to the risks we bear by even having sex. Edit: when we do say we have high libidos we either get called liars or damaged. It #8217;s assumed you must have been raped or had some kind of trauma to want to actively Pursue sex. Or your hormones are imbalanced.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>No there not, but men are far more capable of such acts. I #8217;m sure more women would commit similar crimes if we had the physical strength. This is why abuse that comes from women looks different  amp; is far less physical. I #8217;m only afraid of men more because I know they can easily overpower me  amp; do what they want. In a fight against a woman I have far more chances of surviving. That and every instance of sexual abuse  amp; violence that has happened to me comes from men. I #8217;ve been stalked, raped, groped, hit and shouted at.. all by men. It #8217;s hard to consolidate these occurrences with the fact I shouldn #8217;t fear men, but I do because of their physical strength.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>1.) I thought so too until I keep catching my bf checking out other women and making comments about how gd they look in an innocuous  amp; somewhat innocent way. 2.) Im not afraid of cheating so much as I expect it at this point. Recently found out my previous partner of 6 years who supposedly loved me to death tried to cheat on my several times during the duration of our relationship. Not because it wasn #8217;t going well rather he saw an opportunity. 3.) it #8217;s not even the looking rather the complete lack of respect. 4.) but they still care a bit, I don #8217;t judge others sexual pasts as sex between loving partners is natural. But the fact men will always judge me a little bit for something so natural hurts in a way.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>It #8217;s very common in women to have these kinds of disorders. A women's monthly cycle can affect anxiety levels. Female hormones contribute to a more easily activated, longer-acting fight-or-flight response. Research has shown that the male hormone testosterone  #8212; more abundant in men  #8212; may help ease anxiety symptoms. I have seasonal affective disorder  amp; before taking the pill PMDD. And the latter likens to a mood disorder almost as severe as manic depression caused by hormones. Women are just more prone to these things than men.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>A post from recently about rape  amp; promiscuity has really shown a lot of guys here true colors. Lots of youse clearly don #8217;t even view women as humans, kinda detracts from any kind of interesting interaction if half the participants view the other half as subhumans who deserve to be raped. Honestly the comments here sadden me sometimes  amp; make me feel as if my anxieties about men aren #8217;t misplaced.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I just think maybe the female libido isn #8217;t completely understood. Sure men may generally have a higher libido. But I honestly think women who have experienced good quality sex with a partner who cares about their pleasure have a different understanding of sex than those who don #8217;t. Women who can achieve orgasm at almost every sexual encounter are the women I know with the highest libido.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>See the thing is lots of times they aren #8217;t. Hence my comment about hypocrisy. If you value sex as something sacred only to be done between loving partners then sure look for someone with the same values. But if your sleeping around indiscriminately i think it #8217;s pretty hypocritical to want a partner who is chaste.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Because ppl use the differences to justify demonizing women #8217;s sexuality (if we #8217;re talking differences in libido) Sure some women are more ll but the fact that women #8217;s desire is sometimes lesser doesn #8217;t justify assuming all women only pursue sex for alternate reasons. No one should deny the biological differences as they make the sexes what they are. But I think there #8217;s a misunderstanding concerning the female libido.</TEXT>

She #8217;s clever about it and Is never caught because of only meeting them in secret. Men often cheat in the open, I caught my ex with his hands down some cunts knickers at a football game.. in broad daylight where I was also there with all our aquaintances. Women usually have affairs  amp; men are opportunistic cheaters. Thing is I think generally men will cheat on opportunity  amp; women if something #8217;s missing in the relationship.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Im a Woman. But I stayed in my DB because he kept moving goal posts  amp; manipulating me into believing I was the one with the problem. (Wanting sex more than once a month is normal.. hell I would have settled for 1-2 a week even though I #8217;d preffer 1-2 a day) He kept promising it would get better if I just took off the pressure.. so I did. It #8217;s been 3 months since we were last intimate, I broke it off yesterday because I cannot see it getting better.. only worse. The rejection started to make me resentful. I stayed because I loved him but the lack of sex started to poison other aspects of our relationship. Im quite old fashioned  amp; would rather fix things than throw them away.

    <TEXT>No. Not gonna waste my time fretting about possibly being cheated on or what other women do with their free time.

    <TEXT>Trp guys are essentially sexually unsuccessful men who have created this fantasy land where everyone else is at fault for their shortcomings.. So it's imperative to demonize women who have a sexual history as this is something they feel they've been "denied".(cos women don't have sex they *"give"* it away) That's why women who like most ppl have some kind of relationship/sexual history are seen as used up. Just try to remember these are they guys who are such delusional cucks that they've had to invent a mythical character to shift the blame onto *"stacy*"... I.e the cheerleader who rejected their spotty arse in HS.</TEXT>

I #8217;m clearly here because I care  amp;(believe it or not) because I #8217;m interested in men #8217;s issues. But I am not the one causing their pain, and I think it #8217;s unwise to blame others for your sufferings. Especially people you do not know or understand. Don #8217;t blame  #8220;biology #8221; for your uncouth  amp; nasty beliefs. The men who harm and hate women most certainly are becoming radicalized  amp; hateful (and yes it is misogynistic). It #8217;s not an inconvenience it #8217;s dangerous as these ideas as we #8217;ve seen often lead to violence against innocents. They have a bad reputation because behind these  #8220;innocuous #8221; statements lie the advocacy for rape and murder.. sounds extreme right? But it #8217;s a slippery slope from trp to full blown incel.

And don #8217;t deny it this is what lies behind the innocent mask.. true incels do believe these things) But yes I do think the way society is now is causing a loneliness epidemic  amp; I do think the reason such fringe groups develop is due to loneliness.

    <TEXT>I slept with my first bf after 6 months, I was 15 at the time  amp; a Virgin. I slept with my second bf after 2 dates and barely knowing him. Why? Because I was more experienced  amp; wanted to fuck. At 21 I was more confident in my sexuality  amp; knew what I wanted. You all act like women are even considering you when they want to fuck/feel ready too. It has nothing to do with you  amp; everything to do with how we feel about having sex. The other side of the coin is the fact men respect  amp; value women less the easier she is. Men like a chase (don #8217;t deny it) and will respect you more the longer they have to pursue you. It just shows we value  amp; respect your opinion more than some random dude we don #8217;t give a shit about. If I want a serious relationship chances are I want that person to respect me therefore I will make my next relationship wait.</TEXT>

I #8217;m not impressed by anyone fucking around tbh it just makes me insecure (yes I said it I wish youse would all admit it too!!) and I fkn hate the idea of a partner having had better sex with other more beautiful women.

But guess what? I still managed to lose over 30kg because my health matters to me. Being fat except in the rarest of occasions is choice. Sure curiosity to learn  amp; better yourself are choices. But chances are anyone who possess these qualities will have better options  amp; more self respect than to chose a partner who is causing themselves bodily damage  amp; mental anguish. Being overweight is usually a symptom of low intelligence  amp; negligence.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I think everyone has inappropriate sexual thoughts , whenever I see an attractive man with big hand I can #8217;t help imagining him fingering me or when I see well built men I occasionally imagine them naked. Not an issue, we all do it. It #8217;s the they way men stare for far too long, like sure take a peak but don #8217;t fkn eye rape me as I walk by. I think your wrong about  #8220;soft #8221; men who don #8217;t obviously stare, there not doing it for my benefit rather out of respect for strangers. Why is cumming in someone piggish  amp; gross?? Most natural thing in the world. The only time it becomes an issue is when you make these thoughts know to ppl when it #8217;s unwanted. Men don #8217;t seem to be able to pull themselves back  amp; act in a gracious way, hormones aside you can at least show me the courtesy to look aside when I catch you perving. It #8217;s exhausting to fight off constant unwanted attention, this is why I practice self defense  amp; carry a weapon. What I meant by my comments is I #8217;m appalled at men #8217;s sexuality when they are of a age where they should not be having such thoughts about ridiculously young girls. I #8217;m 22 but I #8217;ve never looked at a 15yr old in a sexual way. The thought turns my stomach.</TEXT>

But most women don #8217;t care about cock size, it #8217;s men who obsess about that. Last time I checked women still orgasm far more from clitoral stimulation. The women who are nasty about men #8217;s looks/hight/penis size are usually childish twats who #8217;s opinion shouldn #8217;t hold much weight. But honestly I see more men ridiculing women for being a bit over weight (it #8217;s gross I #8217;m not defending obesity) or have saggy tits or small tits. Women aren #8217;t visually turned on by men like men are by women. It #8217;s possible to be ugly  amp; charismatic  amp; get a partner more so as a man than as a woman.

    <TEXT>Because most women aren #8217;t so sexual hungry that they #8217;d put up with bad company to get it. Now that it #8217;s socially acceptable for a woman to be single they #8217;d rather be alone than in bad company. I #8217;m single, I know several men would jump at the chance to go out with me. But I know all they want is a fuck so I #8217;d rather be alone. Also the fact I perceive them as less socially competent as me, not looks wise as I #8217;m aware I #8217;m very average looking. But if someone who is my looks match isn #8217;t able to make me laugh  amp; hold a conversation I #8217;d rather be alone. This is the cause of  #8220;lvm #8221; not getting relationships  amp; sex. Women just aren #8217;t as desperate for company  amp; sex as men. Women also generally have more emotional support from their female friends, something men usually only get from a relationship. If male friendships were more loving men might not feel so lonely. But men aren #8217;t able to do this as they would lose social standing  amp; be labeled as a  #8220;pussy #8221; or weak..</TEXT>

    <TEXT>No there not, but with women being less desperate for a shag they don #8217;t put up with ugly losers to get it. Men would listen to a woman #8217;s drivel for hours on the off chance of a crumb of pussy. The solution is for men to stop being so thirsty  amp; learn to be happy without sex  amp; relationships. Men are not less developed there just starved for love as I believe male friendships are less emotionally for filling. Anecdotal but recently my ex #8217;s closes male friend got dumped, he came round devastated and I spoke to him at length about it gave him a hug  amp; tried to help his emotional state (what most women do in such situations). I later asked my ex to reach out  amp; offer some emotional support, he called him pussy whipped  amp; told him to get over it. This is something I #8217;ve seen loads in male friendships, a massive lack of emotional support  amp; understanding. This seems like an extreme example but thus happens to a lesser degree to most men I think.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Yes because as it is with most species men are the dancers, the ones who have to impress the female as women are far more vulnerable and have only 1-2 chances at raising healthy offpring. Men can up and fuck a 1000 women  amp; women generally have fewer chances to reproduce thus the fact that the mate has to be the best possible she can get. Women also have the  #8220;advantage #8221; in that they #8217;re less desperate for sex thus can afford to be picky. It #8217;s nature. Due to biology women have to be more careful in their mate selection. What turns men on innately is far more variable than what turns women on.

    <TEXT>Who is saying that looks don #8217;t matter at all?? Of course looks matter, but compatible personalities are what keep ppl attracted. The whole  #8220;personality is everything #8221; is partly true in that shared hobbies  amp; interests are what help ppl form bonds. But someone has to find you at least somewhat attractive for that to even happen. Looks really are subjective, of course there #8217;s a beauty standard that generally most find attractive. Working on your personality should just be developing hobbies  amp; cultivating skills. If all you do is furiously wank  amp; watch anime chances are your not gonna have that much in common with your average woman.

    <TEXT>**Damage done to you by shitty ppl does not mean you have a free pass to shit on others and hurt them.** Wanna play ball? Let #8217;s go! I moved to a foreign country with my 1st bf, took care of his senile grandfather, cooked cleaned  amp; worked, when I caught him cheating he threw me out.. like with nothing. As a teenager I was raped by a close male friend of mine (or so I thought) I was a Virgin at the time, the law did nothing  amp; he ruined my reputation. I #8217;ve been gropped, shouted at  amp; assaulted by strange men on the street. Been lied to by men about them being single, been slapped around, physically violated, emotionally abandoned  amp; traumatized. There are times when my experiences put on me by men have made me literally wish I were dead. There are times I feel furious at my aggressors. But there are also beautiful moments I #8217;ve shared with men in which I #8217;ve treasured their company. All this happening before reaching the ripe old age of 21. What have I learnt?? That I will never treat others so horrendously as I would be an even worse person than they are as I #8217;ve experienced that pain first hand. I #8217;m not bitter because I #8217;ve had bad experiences  amp; I #8217;m not going to paint all men with the same brush. But most importantly I not going to treat others badly because of my abuse. Grow up.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Because women are told to be chaste  amp; don #8217;t want to appear easy. That #8217;s where the  #8220;no means yes #8221; disgusting narrative comes from, women want to appear innocent but still want it. I think this is why so many women have rape fantasies, you get to still be the innocent party while getting the rough sex you want. It comes from female sexuality being vilified for millennia. I disagree with game players and this idea is dangerous nowadays as misunderstandings can occur. But in order for this to stop women #8217;s sexuality needs to be more socially accepted.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>It easy to counter if your grounded in reality. But its do outlandish it is not worth it, genuinely it #8217;s not. again it is not fun to debate a person who #8217;s views are not based in reality  amp; who #8217;s perspective is uniquely skewed towards hatred that is not realistic. It #8217;s so out of this world it appears like a caricature. Im by no means a skilled debater but nevertheless I genuinely used to enjoy interacting with others here. Now you cannot press a relavent issue if your opponent is constantly changing the subject  amp; arguing with straw men. This is not about free speech, you are not some White knight defending the oppresseds right to speak. Do please climb down from your high horse sir ;) This is about the topics of the sub becoming derailed  amp; cartoonish.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>The thing is high n In women causes the same disgust in women that it does in men when men have slept with ugly women. You feel like if he #8217;s fucked that you must also be on the same level as the fugly dogs he fucked after a night at the bar or out of desperation. Now n count (despite your numerous studies pls don #8217;t spam me for the 10000th time) is only an issue because of insecurity. Knowing my partner had other potentially better looking women than me makes me insecure, I worry I won #8217;t match up. But that doesn #8217;t mean we should police ppls sexual activity. It is not causing issues other than ppls irresponsibility regarding procreation. Personally I #8217;d preffer a Virgin man  amp; wish I was still a Virgin too. But that is unrealistic  amp; a ego thing. I still value sex very highly despite having multiple sexual partners  amp; am able to judge someone character (I.e cheater or not) without knowing his count.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Nope rape fantasies often come from a place of shame. It #8217;s a way to fantasize about sex without being seen as degraded by society. Female sexuality used to be demonized so rape fantasies are about lessening guilt. Read my secret garden  amp; you #8217;ll realize women #8217;s fantasies are just as gross. Now I #8217;m active in the bdsm scene and it is not a way to cope with rape. I think masochists are just deviants, it #8217;s a sexual deviancy. There #8217;s a link in some ppls brain that mixes pain  amp; pleasure. Similar to the thrill of skydiving or horror, the brain releases a bunch of hormones when you experience pain  amp; this gets misinterpreted as pleasure to some. Bdsm is misunderstood by those who don #8217;t enjoy it. I love being chocked  amp; spanked, but only with a trusting  amp; loving partner. I #8217;m a more of a domme though so I can only do such acts because I know how pleasureable they are (sadist) There #8217;s something intoxicating about someone giving up their trust to you  amp; knowing their loving every second of what your doing to them.</TEXT>

But my ex loved always told me I had the most muscular vagina hed ever felt, if she does kegels  amp; comes with you inside her it #8217;ll feel amazing. You can also do kegels. I also get really really wet which makes things worse. What I #8217;ve done is buy weights  amp; wipe away excess wetness. I cum pretty quickly though (5-6 minutes into sex usually) I #8217;ve had 2 partners  amp; one was the size of my thumb  amp; we managed to have great sex, try some positions like Superman doggy.

    <TEXT>The sex toys are something private, masturbation is a solo act  amp; your partner has no buisness knowing how your wanking unless he #8217;s involved in the act. Guessing you had them tucked away because of this. I #8217;d have an open conversation with him about how it #8217;s nothing to do with him  amp; everything to do with your solo pleasure. Make him know how much you enjoy sex with him  amp; that despite the size of the dildos you love him  amp; his dick. Acknowledge his feeling  amp; make him feel heard  amp; loved but make it clear he either should come to terms with the fact you like the dildos or tell him to move on. Gonna get downvoted to hell but I think his reaction is a bit extreme,it #8217;s indicative of trauma that needs addressing . Wanking  amp; sex are separate things. He clearly has trauma related to these issue so I #8217;d suggest therapy together. He needs to get the bottom of these issues or it #8217;ll likely cause him problems in future relationships too.</TEXT>

Loads of women fantasize about being brutally raped but obviously would never actually want that to happen. She was satisfied, she says that herself. Her wanking with massive toys doesn #8217;t mean she wasn #8217;t satisfied. But you can always strive for better sex, trying out new things when it #8217;s right is normal.

The rest are half truths or used to be truth, feminism as a movement is far more needed in 3rd world shit holes than for fat middle class women in the west. Answering your edit, the wage gap has been debunked but their is still discrepancies in wages due to maternity leave  amp; such. The sexual assault study while counting things like groping  amp; catcalling does actually differentiate between rape  amp; molesting. But if even 1 persons being assaulted I find that an issue. Now feminism has given me my rights  amp; I #8217;m extremely grateful but I do realize they are picking at straws at this point  amp; not focusing on the issues that need addressing. Men not being seen as victims has more to do with society  amp; culture not so much feminism</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I think most ppl have insecurities about their genitals, loads of women are insecure about the vulvas being too big or not the right colour. It #8217;s silly really as most genitals vary wildly in looks  amp; I think media like porn mostly depicting a certain look can cause the assumption that anything that deviated from that is abnormal. Just remember it #8217;s normal  amp; shouldn #8217;t affect your confidence.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Marrying a Someone before sleeping with them is a big gamble as stated in the post you #8217;ve linked. Most adults will have had sex by their mid 20s  amp; if they haven #8217;t it #8217;s generally due to religion or LL. At 22 it would be a bit of a red flag to be if someone had had no previous relationships or sexual history. I would likely assume they are either incapable of attracting a partner or not interested in sex  amp; love. I had your  #8220;dream #8221; scenario, we were both virgins. But because we #8217;d never experienced anything else  amp; got together so young we changed to much in formative years that we were no longer compatible. I #8217;ve also been with a man with much more sexual history than me, that wasn #8217;t great either as it was a source of insecurity. (yes I #8217;ll admit  amp; you could all too) I think it #8217;s best to stick with ppl with roundabout the same experiences as you . I #8217;d just accept most healthy adults have some form of sexual history  amp; not shame those who aren #8217;t compatible with your values.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>That #8217;s my experience to a t with my ex. All his ex gfs looked like little blonde dolls. I #8217;m short but chubby with dark hair and very large saggy breasts, I know I don #8217;t have the body most men desire or covet. The type of body I have is the butt of many jokes, I have stretch marks  amp; saggy tits so I #8217;m not exactly a model. I #8217;m never gonna look like the girls in porn  amp; I #8217;m ok with that. I watch porn myself so I #8217;m not bothered by it, I #8217;m not insecure because I know if someone #8217;s with me it #8217;s for a reason. I don #8217;t mind masturbation habits so Long as it doesn #8217;t affect my sex life negatively. I know the men I #8217;ve been with have had better looking partners, but it #8217;s my personality and confidence that has made me attractive to them.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I can understand body insecurities, I #8217;m 22 so having really saggy boobs isn #8217;t the norm for my age  amp; because their so large there very noticeable. Had some bad Eds as a teen  amp; lost a lot of weight quickly only to gain it back so like 40% of my skin has really large indentations on it. But I have learnt to accept what I can #8217;t change otherwise I #8217;d still be borderline suicidal about my shortcomings. I still have days where I feel like shit but it #8217;s gotten better with age. I don #8217;t feel undesirable as I know I #8217;m more than a body  amp; I can offer much more than just a pair of tits or a big arse. I think the fact I look like I do does make me feel even more secure in a way as I know looks are replaceable but compatibility  amp; and having something about you isn #8217;t. If someone is only with you for your looks your very replaceable (you could say the same about dick size) You don #8217;t have to be a model to get love  amp; you don #8217;t need a porn star dick for someone to like sex with you.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>No it shows one of the three points above. Why do you assume women who don #8217;t have sex even want it? LL is probably the reason, if you have nice options  amp; turn them all down your likely not too interested in sex. If you have no options your unattractive.

    <TEXT>Well then they wait, but most ppl do fall in love (not fanny flutters I mean love) and want sex. Most adults have the desire to fuck their partners and don #8217;t have this medieval concept of staying a Virgin till your 35. And be honest most ppl have fallen in love before reaching adulthood  amp; if they haven #8217;t their likely basement dwellers who #8217;ve never left their home. With my 1st bf I genuinely thought we #8217;d be together forever, didn #8217;t happen and I wasn #8217;t gonna wait 7 years without sex on the off chance it wouldn #8217;t work out. I don #8217;t know what your suggesting here but most couples don #8217;t stay together forever (especially if they met at a young age) Your viewing this as if women don #8217;t desire sex  amp; should just not have it.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Your missing the point entirely.. Let me summarize: ppl who have sex in relationships have a healthy normal libido, ppl who don #8217;t have sex in relationships are damaged, have trust issues or no desire for sex. Most healthy  amp; socially competent adults have had a relationship thus are no longer virgins. If someone has multiple long term relationships without having sex that just tells me they aren #8217;t interested in it. What are you suggesting? Staying together for years but remaining a Virgin? You have the one trying to change the argument despite me being clear multiple times. You have no answer to this because it doesn #8217;t fit your narrative.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>It #8217;s not freedom to chose rather their getting the attention they need to orgasm thus they want more sex. But yes I do think women are often too passive in what they want. There is the problem that men don #8217;t perform oral sex nearly as often  amp; some women are too shy to ask for it. Also the stigma that vaginas are yucky/smelly/unaesthetic etc.. I think lots of women don #8217;t even realize how gd sex can be if your partner genuinely wants to get you off  amp; many don #8217;t even realize what their missing out on. Also women tend to be ppl pleasers so they may feel they have to do certain sex acts to please their partner/have sex in ways they don #8217;t enjoy as much. As a teen I always wondered why I wasn #8217;t enjoying sex a much as I  #8220;should #8221; have been. There #8217;s the fact for lots of women piv just doesn #8217;t do much, it #8217;s when I started asking for oral that I truly started to enjoy myself.</TEXT>

After I lose the last stone I #8217;ll be happy. But being fit is possible for everyone  amp; having a nice body too. Just gotta push yourself. Only reason you can #8217;t have an hourglass figure is if you #8217;ve got massive shoulders  amp; no tiddies.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Don #8217;t, I never used to have a bum until I started lifting  amp; doing squats. If your the right weight you should have a flat belly. Google callanetics, the exercises are made for getting longer neck  amp; more defined jaw. The stomach exercises will get you a nice flat belly  amp; big arse. I #8217;ve been doing them for 4 months and can already see a massive improvement. But in reality a healthy body is a hot one :)</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I suppose it #8217;s different for everyone, I eat high carb  amp; protein diet  amp; that works great.
