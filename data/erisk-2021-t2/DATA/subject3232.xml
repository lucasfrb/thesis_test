    <TEXT>Well just think about it logically. On the news when they talk about pollution from diesels they talk about the amount of pollution per lets say 100l and that number is higher than gasoline engines. But what they fail to mention is that an avarage diesel engine that uses 4-5l per 100km it will go about 2500km with those 100l. While the average gasoline engine that uses 8-9l per 100km will only go about 1200km so if you go by the amount of pollution per distance traveled the gasoline engines will end up with higher numbers than diesels. My math may be a bit off but still the difference is pretty huge</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Only thing that can help global warming is shutting down big factories those are the biggest polluters. I don't know the exact details but Germany once tried to ban all cars it was in some city i don't really remember the name. Anyways for two weeks no cars were driven and when they checked the air pollution levels they were the same maybe a small decrease but so small that it wouldn't make a difference then they realised this was because those two weeks the factories never stopped working so they shut up about it so they wouldn't have to close the factories that were probably making them rich</TEXT>

    <TEXT>It doesn't have to be pd tho you only need pd if they have really bursty champs like rengar or khazix or anyone who can 1shot you if they dont have champions like that it's better to go zerkers into statikk then ie. If they have lots of ap oneshots then go zerkers hexdrinker into pd then ie. It all depends on the matchup. Especially if you are losing lane agains ap hexdrinker is a must. If losing lane against ad then chainlink armor is a must but always and i mean always buy zerkers first no matter what, the atackspeed you get saves you soooo much because yasuo q scales with attack speed not cdr</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Yea i hate these kinds of players, it's even worse in bronze thats why i never play ranked. I tried to play ranked but every single game there is at least one kid saying no yasuo allowed but they dont understand that i will hard carry most games as a yasuo becuse i have been playing him in normals for a year now and i may not be amazing at yasuo but lower elo players don't know how to play against yasuo so i always win lane. Everytime i play ranked i feel like a kata main because they keep banning yasuo and i have to play kata. I have 30k mastery on kata from just yasuo being banned and me locking in kata. Thats how many times yasuo has been banned. This is why those yasuo 0/10 powerspike memes need to stop because some kids take them seriously</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Ok so i won't be able to get you that video because it is 7gb and with my shiddy internet it will take forever to upload. What i did the whole game was focus on cs. I didn't chase kills, i didn't join teamfights where it was 2v5 or something stupid like that all i did was focus on my lane and the jungle spawns. Took a few enemy red and blue buffs, went to top lane a few times and got the minions. Even when i was stuck in their side of the map behind their turrets i was killing the minions that were spawning until i could leave. If you still need any tips or anything like that just dm me. I am not the best yasuo player i only have 120k mastery but i feel like i'm pretty decent at him. Also never do what i did and buy steraks and phantom dancer i did that because i had guardian angel instead of pd and when i sold ga i bought the first thing i saw. I was planning on selling it and buying something else but we ended the game by then.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I always take conq when i play against at least 2 tanks in enemy team, or champs who have resolve runes. I take electrocute when they are all low armor or when they have an adc that outputs an insane amount of damage like jinx, jhin, varus, vayne,etc.. so i can go after the adc so he doesn't hurt my team. I sometimes take electrocute when i have a really hard matchup and don't want to feed. For me that would be talon, zed, malphite on mid, kassadin, malzahar and especially fizz. It all depends also on your playstyle if you are playing extremely aggressive like diving turrets and going for kills then take electrocute but if you are more of a wait for them to get low so you can clean up and get some pentas then you should definitely go conq. Keep in mind i'm still at 60k mastery points so i don't have too much experience but i do have mastery 7 so i must be doing something right.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I always buy QSS When laning against high cc because i cant play without ignite, and it's a very bad idea to play without flash. So i would recommend either going flash clense for a couple of games and see if you have the same kill presure as flash ignite. If not then go flash ignite and buy qss after buying zerkers then buy pd for his burst, then IE if you are winning lane if not go mercurial then after that go IE and last items are highly situational if you need sustain i would recommend Bloodthirster and Deaths dance(which is very good on yas after the new buff) or if you need more MR you could go wits end and GA. Just see what works for you honestly</TEXT>

    <TEXT>But kata is soooo easy to counter i have only lost lane maybe like 2 times to a kata once i wasnt playing my main and the sekond time rhe kata had 600k mastery but usually i destroy lane. I play yasuo and when he is banned i go zoe. She is super easy to counter as long as you avoid the daggers. So IMO kata is very balanced as long as you know how to play. Just go all in on her before she gets her gunblade because that is her biggest powerspike. Problem is most bronzies dont know how to play against kata just like yasuo and cry about them being unbalanced</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Ffs i am afraid they are going to ruin katarina by nerfing her a lot more in the upcoming patches. Most people complained about kata with conqueror and gunblade. Now with this nerf we are being forced to play her with conq because any other rune and she will be too weak imo. Maybe she will be strong early but late even with dark harvest you will really feel that 12% decrease</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I'm not really sure but most of the damage kata does is from her passive and from her R. Whenever i play kat electrocute i rely mostly on killing them as fast as possible by hitting them with as many passive daggers as possible so i don't get killed. When i paly conqueror most of the time i survive teamfights even when i go in first bacuse of conq. If now a fed kata can kill a jhin with 3 daggers the nerf will make it so it takes at least 4. In my experience by the time i hit the 3rd dagged on jhin he has fired 2 bullets and if he fires a third he kills me. Well the new nerf will let jhin shoot 3 times before all 4 daggers hit him so you will have to use R even when 1v1 him unless he is so far behind he does no damage to you and even in that case he will leave you low enough that you won't survive a teamfight. Keep in mind that i am still new at kata but so far that has been my experience. And now because electrocute is gonna be a not so favorable option for kata more players will eventually switch to conq for the sustain.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Not really tbh he is super easy to counter. You can remove his passive shield with q before going in, his q scales with AS so before he builds zerkers and a statikk or PD his cd will be 4 seconds for q. His W is at 23s cd, his e is easy to avoid by taking the fights away from your minions. He is really easy to counter but most people dont take the time to learn how, they would rather just cry about him being broken. Yasuo is only good when played by a good player or when overfed. I am a yasuo and kata main and i can say that kata is 10 times easier to play and 10 times more annoying to play against unless you are playing a ranged mid laner so you can avoid her passive</TEXT>

But i dont think rito will do that because its much easier to nerf 5-10 champions that people complain about then it is to nerf conq and have to rebalance 30 champions so they dont become weak. Also side rant wtf is up with them buffing annie JUST BECAUSE NO ONE PLAYS HER DOESN'T MEAN SHE ISN'T BROKEN. The ammount of times i have been oneshot by an annie that spawned a fucking bear on my head even when i had a 3-4 kill lead and a +2 level lead is fucking insane. Also ilaoi i hate that bitch champion so much. I was playing aatrox on top i kill her 5 times before she reaches level 6 by the time she reached 6 i was level 8. As soon as she got to level 6 she started dominating lane. I get her down to less than half hp then i go qnd all she had to do is tentacle rape me until i was dead which took about 3 seconds even with the lifesteal i had, they dont nerf shit champions like her instead they nerf kata...</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Yea but there are champs that are much more broken for example lets take malzahar he can just lock on one person and make his life miserable how tf is it ok for a champion to be able to disable you for 5 seconds. Or lux a champion that can do up to 1000dmg by pressing one button and maybe even more and that thing can go to as low as 15s cd. Or lets take a look at mundo he can just press R and your damage is useless especially if he is going for full tank. Or shaco who spends most of the game invisible and has one of the hardest engages when ganking by using q. Also lets not forget kassadin who has a flash every few seconds which would be beyond broken if he wasn't easy to counter. My point is there are champions 10000 times worse than yasuo but he gets all the hate because its been memed the fuck out.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I would recommend you keep this logical question in mind when deciding if you are for or against 5g. "If 5G is harmful then how will the scientist that say it is safe, and the big companies that want 5g to be released globally keep themselves safe? How will they avoid all the 5g radiation? Or are millions of them willing to risk their lives and the lives of their close ones just for money?"</TEXT>

    <TITLE>Help!! Opel astra z17dth 2006 camshaft sensor problems</TITLE>
    <DATE>2020-08-09 17:48:31</DATE>
    <TEXT>Ok so here is what happened, the customer was driving the car and noticed that it had low water level so he came to my shop and we took it apart and saw that the head gasket was leaking. Replaced it, got a new head , new valves etc. But some holidays came and the car sat like that for like a month without a battery. When we put it back together we tried to start it and it didn't want to so i hooked it up to diagnostics and it showed that the key fobs were not programmed, so i programmed them and when i tried to start the car and again no luck. When i went to check the fault codes again i got camshaft sensor fault, checked timing it was spot on so i decided to get a new sensor. I put it on, nothing still not starting. So i got another one and this one was a cheaper one, when i put it on the car started but was in limp mode and was showing cam sensor fault but when i went to the live read it showed the correct rpm. So far i have checked timing five times, an electrician came and looked at all the wires, i even replaced crankshaft sensor following someone's advice. And still no luck. Car turns over and wont start, if you take out the connector from the sensor or remove the sensor from it's holder it starts but is in limp mode. Any help would be fantastic</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Ok so today i decided to push it till it either started or broke down even more. So i hooked it up with a backup battery and began trying to start it. And at first it turned over slowly but after a while it started turning over like it does when its just about to start. It went on like that for a good minute or so and finaly it started i let it work for like 10 minutes and then when i tried to start it again it just turned over like before kinda like it is about to start but it never did, after a while the starter began to smell bad so i stopped so i wouldnt damage it. Any idea why it would do this. When the car started it worked perfectly, no weird noises or anything. Also idk if this is related but it showed a fault code in the CIM: CAN bus no communication with under hood something i dont really remember.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>That is true but that's why i said we are right 70% of the time and not always, you would still need to come to the shop for me to tell u what the issue is 100%. There are only very rare cases where if someone wanted to fix the car by themselves and i know that for that car type, those symptoms are super unique and there is now way that it could be anything else i tell them to replace that certain part. But in most cases i just tell them what it might be based on what i've heard but tell them to come to the shop so we can be 100% sure</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I guess i worded this wrong. What i was trying to say was we can tell you what problems might be causing those symptoms and based on how and when the symptoms first appeared which problem is the most likely, and event tho most of the time that guess is correct it is still a guess and without bringing the car to the shop we can't be sure. So pretty much the answer is yes but it's really not recommended because it will probably do more harm than good if we are wrong.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>If you wanna make an impact every game become a mid main, it is the most game impacting role besides the jungler. The way i play mid is, if i know i win the fight vs the laner i engage as soon as i see an opening and win the fight 90% of the time, if i win i make sure to push the lead and keep punishing that laner and after i've gotten 2-3 kills i push the mid wave and look to either bully top/bottom laners or help my jg invade enemy jg. However if i am not sure whether i win the matchup or not i just play safe and try to setup my jungler to gank lane, if im still unsure if that was a good enough lead i ask for a couple more ganks which if are successful (successful gank doesn't mean getting a kill even if you make the.enemy laner back.that is still a successful gank). Then i roam again to punish more lanes and ultimately win the game. If anything is unclear or you need champ suggestions feel free to dm me or comment.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Knowing when to back has way too many variables for it to be explained in just a single comment but pretty much any time the enemy laner backs and you see their jungler near your lane so you cant take platings or the platings have fallen and you feel like you dont have enough time to fully take tower you just push the wave and back. My best tip that really helped me would be to watch how quickly the enemy laner clears the wave and go off of that and if he is laner and you need to back due to low hp/mana/ you got lots of gold try to do that on a cannon wave. When it comes to being behind on cs, dont look at other lanes look at mid lane and how you compare to their mid laner because in a recent patch they nerfed mid cs so you get less cs now. But if you have more cs than enemy mid then you are doing good. A champion i would recommend learning is yasuo. I know he's become a meme but if you put in the work and learn to play him the benefit is huge. For me he is one of the easiest ad champs to farm with but if you wanna go ap then i would recommend xerath he has a poky playstyle in early game and in late you just delete everyone with a single e q w combo. If you need any tips/help on playing xerath or yasuo tell me and i will write up some tips for both of them</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Ok so for Yasuo: 1. Buy Berzerkers first (i've seen too many people buying zeal first) and then zeal second 2. If you are playing against heavy ap and are losing go for hexdrinker after Zeal but don't upgrade it to maw at least untill you have your Infinity Edge. Preferably buy Zerkers gt;Zeal gt;IE gt;Statikk gt;Maw 3.If you are vs a champion you don't feel comfortable playing against don't force fights untill you have Zerkers and Zeal (Your q cd will be too long without them and it will be a lot harder to win the fight) 4.Don't buy PhantomDancer and Hexdrinker (same passive) 5.Your R is kinda tricky and it took me a long time to realise R will be cast on the knocked up player closest to your cursor (for example there is a 5 man knock up and if your cursor is not in the middle of them you will not R all of them you will R those closest to the cursor) 6. Practice airblades (if someone is knocked up do EQR either on them or on minions/champions close to them) there are lots of videos that explain it better. 7. Don't take every R ( this is so important, I've seen too many players instantly click R as soon as they see someone is knocked up) 8. If u are playing mid ban sylas he is the hardest counter on mid if playing top then ban renekton. 9. If they have very high cc comp go for clense or if you feel like you can't play without ignite buy Mercurial Schimitar (cc is your worst enemy) 10. Don't build the same items every game (try to itemise for their team) 11. Don't dash just because u can (most of the time you will end up going where you didn't mean to) 12. If you are chasing someone and there are enemy minions near them dash on all the minions first save dashing on the champion as a last resort. 13. Don't be afraid to be aggressive if you are wining lane (yasuo can punish anyone if he is fed) 14. If you die 2-3 times just farm under tower and wait for your Zerks gt;Pd gt;IE powerspike at that point most champs will be easy kills 15. Don't buy statikk unless u are forced to buy hexdrinker pd is 100times better 16. If you get a lead in lane start roaming (this is a tip for all mid laners but especially yasuo since he scales super hard) 17. If your jg is not falling behind the enemy jg ask him to take his red it helps a lot but do this after 20-25 min mark 18. Take enemy raptors any chance u get (cs is your friend) 19. Late game try to push as many lanes as u can but dont stay for tower unless you know where everyone is or you know you can at least 1vs2 them 20. Don't use your W to block an AA just to save your passive shield (it recharges pretty fast if u keep moving around) That's pretty much all i could think of right now if i remember anything else i will comment again if any of the tips is unclear/needs more explanation tell me.</TEXT>
