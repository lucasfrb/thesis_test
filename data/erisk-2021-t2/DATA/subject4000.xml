    <TEXT>I was struggling with life in general. I had to go and get blood tests done for a medical issue. I had been self harming in the few days before that and was absolutely mortified at the nurse having to see my arms. I made some sort of banal joke about it (my go-to defense system to prevent sympathy from others) and she looked me dead in the eyes, stroked my arm and said 'honey, you are perfect just the way you are'. It hit me hard.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>He told me that he loved me about a week after we started seeing each other. Major red flag and almost a deal breaker. A little more than a year later, we are engaged and he has flown across Australia twice to be with me for family funerals. I can't imagine life without him. I'm so glad I ignored that red flag.</TEXT>

Moved house again, moved shop, lost my grandfather. Flew cross country for his funeral and a week after I got back, my father passed away. Flew back again for his funeral which damn near ended me. Got home, dog goes into labour, emergency surgery after hours and lost her puppy. Injured myself again, had to have emergency surgery. But I did get engaged so there's that.</TEXT>

The nurse (male, if it matters) looked at me with a shocked expression and said, 'congratulations!!' after a half a heartbeat and a thousand thoughts he followed with 'you're not pregnant!' I was there for exploratory surgery to find the cause of my infertility. What an ass.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I texted an acquaintance 'happy 40th birthday!!'. That was the extent of the text, and the first text I had sent him. His girlfriend called me and screamed at me for 30 minutes, telling me amongst other things that she was going to abort his baby because of me and that she was going to find me and beat the crap out of me. I noped out of that friendship immediately and I often wonder now what happened with them.</TEXT>

I used to sit for hours and he would play songs such as '6 white bloomers', 'how much is that doggy in the window' and 'the lion sleeps tonight' he had a friend that he played guitar with every Saturday night but as far as I know he never performed for anyone but us kids. He stopped playing when he got sick.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Sit down with your mum and find out what her end game is. She must have some sort of connection to your father, or you wouldn't exist. She may genuinely be falling for him again, it seems like she is tiptoeing around you trying to encourage a relationship (or yes, trying to force it, which is wrong) and hoping that you can all get along. There's loads of reasons this could be happening, maybe she is concerned about you and needs help, or is trying to put another person in your life that will hopefully have your back. Perhaps make a list of questions (are you and him romantically involved? Why do you want us to have contact all of a sudden? Etc) and sit down and have a heart to heart.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Being socially awkward, I run through everything in my mind to work out how I will react in every possible scenario. I went on a kind of date a few years ago and I was trying to figure out the payment bit - do I let him pay? But I can't assume that he will? Do I pay for myself and risk offending him? WHAT DO I DO? So my plan of action was to get my purse out and look like I was happy to pay, then it would be up to him whether to pay for me or not. Solid plan, right? We were heading to an all you can eat. I hadn't been to this one before but I had been to another owned by the same people, and you paid as you went in the door then paid for drinks as you go. So I meet the kind-of date at the restaurant, he was waiting for me. At the door I start to pull my purse out but he walks straight to a table. 'sweet', I think. 'He's already paid, I don't have to look awkward'. So we have our meals and have a great time. At the end of the night we leave, I go straight out the door with nary a concern. Then I turn around to see where he is, and he's standing at the counter paying for our meals. I died a little inside that night.</TEXT>

Now I only notice them if something draws my attention to them. And the last time anyone actually asked me about them? Early 20's.</TEXT>

You go ahead and cry, or scream, or walk through your days with your head held high and your heart locked down. What ever feels right to you. Take the help that people offer, they want to make things easier for you, let them. Tell people you are not ok. You don't need to tell them more than that. Let yourself remember your baby as much as you can, hold her in your heart. You are not alone, when you are ready, reach out to the links people have suggested above. Much love to you and your daughter, I'm so sorry.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Tonight I cried, Mum. For the first time since we started trying to get pregnant 3 years ago. I didn't cry through the initial doctors appointments. I didn't cry the first time I had an internal exam. I didn't cry when I had surgery, or the hormones, or being gut wrenchingly disappointed every single month. Not when they said there's nothing wrong with me. Not when I was 3 weeks late but it turned out to be nothing. But tonight out of nowhere it came. How unfair it is. How much it hurts to face the realisation it will probably never happen. How much I hate the well meaning advice - 'just relax, stop stressing, it'll happen'. How much I resent every damn friend who announces their pregnancy. I cried. A lot. Then I got up and ate a packet of chocolate pop tarts. I can't tell you this Mum because Dad died not that long ago, and I know you desperately need your girl to be ok. I need you mum, but I'm OK.</TEXT>

I promise you it will come, I used to be messy as hell, (the type to go buy new plates so I didn't have to wash the old ones) but I got to a point where I wasn't dying of embarrassment if someone dropped over.

    <TEXT>Omg I accidentally flipped the camera to selfie mode when I wasn't prepared for it and actually cried. But seriously, let your mum take the photos, let her take thousands of them, but ask her not to post any of you before you can ok. There will be a time when you are grateful for those photos but you are perfectly within your rights not to have pictures of you posted online without your consent. Your mum just wants to show the world her baby, she doesn't see what you see in the mirror. Ask her can she please text the photos to her friends and family, that way she still gets to show you off and your family still gets to see you but you don't have to see the photos until you're ready.

    <TEXT>This!! I've learnt to say it straight up now, hints and hopes don't work. 'hey love it's valentine's day this weekend, can you please buy me some flowers?' the pleasure comes from the flowers he picks, when he knows I want something, he actually puts a lot of thought into it and will come back with yellow flowers 'because yellow is a happy colour and you make me happy'. But valentines day means nothing to him, it's not even a blip on his radar, so 'hoping' he will get flowers is setting both of us up for disappointment and anger. I love him too much to put him in a position to fail. Occasionally I'll ask something and it will be thrown back in my face, and that's ok too, because my expectations are not his expectations. I don't take it personally because he doesn't mean it personally. (hey love it's Easter this weekend, can you please buy me an Easter egg? '...' don't be fucking ridiculous, it's a waste of money and you can buy chocolate whenever you like ') He also kind of freezes without any guidelines. He's hopeless with birthday presents, and if I don't point him in the right direction, I'll either get nothing or maybe a pair of socks. But if I say hey love for my birthday I'd love a necklace or perhaps a watch, it gives him a starting point and he doesn't have to worry about getting me something I don't like or want. You can ask for things without being greedy (remember it goes both ways, did you get him a flower?) and he can refuse without being stingy, if both of you are open about your expectations and beliefs.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>So, my fiance bought himself a smoker (as in a BBQ that cooks with smoke, not a person with a pack a day habit). He's so proud of it and so excited. I've supported him the whole way with helping him save up - it's a high end one - and researching ideas. It's amazing to see him so passionate and excited about it. My issue is, I really can't stand smoked food. I hate the smell and the taste. In the 24 hours we've had the smoker, I've eaten smoked pork ribs, smoked Maryland, smoked corn cobs, smoked potatoes, smoked brisket, smoked pumpkin and smoked squash. My hair smells of smoke, my washing stinks, my house smells. But I smile and say, it tastes amazing! Because how can you say otherwise when his face is excited and proud of the meal he's made for you. I don't know how long I will be able to eat this for without gagging, and I'm too far into the game now to tell him I don't like it. How can I learn to like the taste?</TEXT>

    <TEXT>You're a legend. To answer your concern, I didn't know how much I didn't like smoked food before. I'd had it before and it was take-it-or-leave-it, but I quit smoking a few weeks ago and my taste and smell capabilities have returned with a vengeance, I'm discovering all sorts of things I thought I liked but it turns out that I don't. Sauces are a genius idea!! Thank you!</TEXT>

    <TITLE>Question about calorie deficit</TITLE>
    <DATE>2020-06-12 02:44:46</DATE>
    <TEXT>I'm just starting out on my weight loss journey. Due to personal reasons, I am not using a scale or weighing myself at all, my goal is to get healthy and drop a clothing size. All the reading I have done says I need to create a calorie deficit, which obviously makes sense. I'm using my fitness pal and fitbit to track my food and exercise. My question is, mfp tells me that I can eat approximately 5000 kj per day to lose 1kg a week, which I've been doing . However I exercise between 30-60 minutes every day and mfp says I burn about 2000kj each day, fitbit says I burn about 2500 calories. This is less than the kj that I'm allowed to eat but both mfp and fitbit seem to be happy with my progress. But if I'm eating more than I'm burning, aren't I still gaining weight not losing it? Why is mfp happy with what I'm doing? What am I missing? Should I be working out even more? Am I not exercising hard enough? Do I need to eat less? Or is it something else? Please help, if I'm not tracking my weight and just 'trusting the process', I need to be certain that the process works!</TEXT>

The last time I lost weight by using scales, I built myself a spreadsheet that would come up in green if I'd lost weight. If I'd gained even 0.1kg, I'd written a formula so it would flash up 'you fat f#ck'. Soon enough I was obsessively weighing myself 4 times a day and eating one meal every two days. That's why I wanted to avoid the scales this time around, so thank you so much for changing the way I see it!! I</TEXT>

    <TITLE>What should I expect?</TITLE>
    <DATE>2020-06-25 12:27:03</DATE>
    <TEXT>I have FINALLY graduated to the next level of treatment after clomid has failed for 18 months. I've been referred to a fertility clinic and had our first phone conference with them today (I live in a remote town in Australia). The doctor indicated that we will go straight to ivf and mentioned injections and egg collection and fertilising the egg with the best sperm. I'm 38 and she has basically told me that time is running out (this I know). My questions-- what will happen at the clinic? As in, what sort of things will they ask me / do to me? I'm not a socially confident person so it will be so helpful knowing what to expect. Is it normal to be this nervous? I feel like this is my last shot and I'm so scared. With the injections, what sort of side effects should I expect? I've proven to be quite vulnerable to previous hormone treatment and I want to know what I'm up for. Any reassurance or support is welcome. Thank you for reading</TEXT>

The goal was to feel good, and I realised I sure didn't feel good when I was anorexic. I'm now the kind of person who bounds out of bed in the morning. I weigh myself in the morning and genuinely forget what the number is by lunch time, because it honestly doesn't matter, except to help calculate my calorie goal for the day. I'm so happy for you, that excitement and pride of accomplishing such a goal is incredible!</TEXT>

    <TITLE>I got cocky</TITLE>
    <DATE>2020-07-18 08:44:42</DATE>
    <TEXT>I've been working on my health for a couple of months now. I quit smoking, quit drinking, started counting calories, focusing on what's going into my body. Every afternoon I go for a bike ride where 80% my heart rate is in the cardio zone. Every morning I get up at 5am and take the dogs for a brisk walk, and intermittently during that walk I'll break into a jog. All my numbers are going in the right direction, I found calf muscles and biceps, I'm feeling so much better in myself. But I got cocky. Yesterday I took one dog for a walk and broke into a jog. I was surprised by how easy it was, and the dog slowed down before I did. So when I got home, I was bragging to my husband about how much I'd improved and that the dogs were holding me back, perhaps I should try going for an actual run without the dog, I reckon I'd be able to handle it, no worries! Spoiler alert: I could not handle it. I set off today, started at a brisk walk to warm up, then when I crossed the highway I started jogging. I was determined to jog for a solid 10 minutes, how hard could it be? 60 seconds in and I'm gasping like an asthmatic giraffe that needs to sneeze. 3 minutes in and I have to pause to vomit. The next 3 minutes I have so much saliva flooding my mouth and due to the aforementioned gasping, every time I try and breathe in, I'm choking on my own spit. I interchange 30 seconds of jogging with 30 seconds of brisk walking. There's sweat pouring off me and I can feel my face is redder than it has any right to be. At the 10 minute mark I turn and powerwalk home. My husband starts laughing as soon as I make it inside. I collapse face first on the floor rug and decide, nope, definitely not there yet! Anyone have any reassurance--or any tips?</TEXT>

My issue is, as my fitness has increased in actually struggling to raise my heart rate enough to get in my cardio for the day. I love riding and I want to stick with it but I'm a bit stuck on how I can challenge myself. There are no hills where I live. Going for longer isn't feasible during the week. I'm already in the lowest possible gear. I thought about using ankle weights but apart from that I don't really know where to go from here, any advice is welcome! Oh I should add that I've only been riding for about 8 weeks so pretty new at it. I don't have special equipment and I live remotely so there's no sports stores anywhere close.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Exactly this. Make tiny changes, all day long. Doing something is better than doing nothing. Don't hate yourself or give up if you have a bad day, draw a line under it and move on. Swap a coke for water. Swap a family size packet of chips for a family size packet of popcorn. Halve the amount of oil you cook with. Have chopped up fruit  amp; veggies ready to go so it's easier to grab them for a snack. If you want to indulge, then do it. Instead of having a full takeaway meal, just get a burger. Then next time scrape a little sauce off the burger. Then next time take the pickles off. Use my fitness pal and be honest with it. Tiny changes now makes a big difference later.</TEXT>

At first I was really angry, then I cried, then I got sad because I didn't realise how bad his addiction was until now and me asking him to abstain would have made it so much worse for him. Then, I sighed and let it go. There's no point getting upset, right? I asked him to do something nearly impossible for him so I have no right to be upset that he couldn't do it.

    <TITLE>Has anyone heard of ovaries moving during retrieval?</TITLE>
    <DATE>2020-09-30 12:17:24</DATE>
    <TEXT>I had my first retrieval on Monday, and the doctor told me something that I didn't really pay attention to at the time. She said she had to leave 4 eggs behind because my ovary on my right side had moved higher, there were blood vessels and stuff in the way and she had to do what was safest and leave them behind. Given I only got 8 eggs, leaving four behind is a significant number. Has anyone else had this happen, or heard of it? Does it make sense to people with more of a knowledge of biology than me? Shouldn't this have been noted during my scan a couple of days prior? This was never mentioned to me as a risk and there's nothing I can find online.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I'm 38 years old and I had AN for about 10 ish years as a teen/ early adult. Can I just say, I was never skinny enough back then as soon as I hit my gw, I'd just drop my gw. I used to cry when I hit the gw because it was supposed to be the magic number but omg I was still so fat. I told myself, 5 more kilos, 2 more kilos, my thighs still wobble when I jump up and down so 5 more kilos... I was so ill. I look back now at the (very few) photos from that time, as an almost middle aged woman and at an almost overweight weight, and my heart breaks for baby me. There is so much pain behind those dead eyes and fake smiles. I should have been having fun then, running amok, going camping, travelling overseas but instead I stayed in my safe places so I can eat my safe foods and wear my safe clothes and avoid all the questions, and convince myself that I was ok. I guess I'm trying to say to you, you have that mindset now, you will still have that mindset at your first gw, then you're second gw. Your body and your weight is not the problem here, the chemicals in your brain are. You are beautiful NOW. I promise. I don't know you but I can guarantee I can find beauty in you. One day, you will find this beauty too. Please don't get hooked up on this 'I won't be good enough until...' mentality.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>TTC for three years naturally with no success and feeling gutted every month when my period came? That's ok, lots of people have trouble, and you aren't 20 anymore. See a gynaecologist who put me on tablets that had bizarre side effects? It's alright, it might help, it's worth it. Go through surgery so they can go and have a look and see what's wrong, only to find absolutely nothing? No worries, it's a good thing right? Nothing is wrong. Covid hits and your gynie tells you over the phone to just keep going with the current treatment, only to find out that 12+ months on clomid is not a good idea? I'm ok. It's ok. Finally get a referral to a fertility clinic? YES. Develop high estrogen and your ovaries are going insane during stim stage? I'm ok, it means there's lots of follicles, it's good in a way. Your husband gets called out bush for the second week of stims so you're caring for your stepson while travelling 600km every two days for bloods and scans, getting up at 3am and not being able to go to bed until 9pm because that's when you do your injections, while working as well? I totally got this. Getting the call telling you they won't do a fresh transfer because I'm high risk of OHSS? This sucks, but I have two more months to get stronger. Going for retrieval only to come out of anaesthesia to be told that all those follicles only had 12 eggs, and they could only reach 8 of them? Ok that hurts. Literally, they must have been jumping on my ovaries in there. Only 5 mature? 5 is heaps! Only two fertilised? You're ok, you only need one... You're ok. Only one left one day four? Shit... You only need one, it's ok. None left on day 5? I'm ok. I'm ok.</TEXT>
