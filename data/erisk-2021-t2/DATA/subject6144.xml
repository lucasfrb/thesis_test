    <DATE>2018-09-08 03:43:25</DATE>
    <TEXT>i'm kind proud of myself. i've managed to trick myself into thinking that im okay. but everything seems fine and then something really stupid makes me sad, like i see a bird fly by and i wish i could fly too, or i miss the trash when throwing something out, or the teacher calls on me when i tried to hide my face, and it's everything i can do not to cry.</TEXT>

    <TITLE>i'm wearing 'the sweater'</TITLE>
    <DATE>2018-10-19 20:21:26</DATE>
    <TEXT>you know the one. it's big and fluffy and smells of tears. it's heavy enough to weigh you down in bed. it calls to you when your head is heavy. so you put it on and expect to feel happier, but you don't. you just feel warm and comfortable, and that's close enough because right now you're depressed. mine is salmon coloured with grey sleeves. what colour is yours? I'm so *fucking* sick of trying to resist putting it on. so i don't. i let it envelope me whenever the world seems too big for me. i put it on, watch old Nickelodeon classics like icarly, victorious, drake and josh, etc. and i just wait for something to feel okay again. edit: nearly two days later and im still wearing. i almost feel like i want someone to dive into it and pull me ashore, to an island where i can just feel okay. an island where there's no depression, where i live close to my friends, where my local friends care about me, and where i can just feel okay. but i can't.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>i don #8217;t know if it #8217;s the same for anyone here, but i find myself thinking about death a lot. i always think about how the world will end, how obscenely small and insignificant i am. i always catch myself thinking,  #8220;when the apocalypse comes, i #8217;ll kill myself so i don #8217;t have to live through it. #8221; and i never thought before that i would be even considering that. a lot of people always say they love space, it fascinates them and they want to know more about it. i used to say i love learning about space, but every time i hear about the black holes they discover, the size of the stars, the emptiness filled by more nothingness stretching forever into everything, i just feel sad. i want to say that what we have is amazing but i can #8217;t bring myself to lie anymore. nothing is coming and nothing has passed and i don #8217;t consider myself lucky. i #8217;m sorry if this brought you down but i needed to vent.</TEXT>

    <TITLE>my parents blame me for experiencing insomnia as a result of depression</TITLE>
    <DATE>2019-07-14 12:47:37</DATE>
    <TEXT>almost every single night i stay up until around 6 am, go downstairs and make breakfast, and then go back to my room in hopes that my parents don #8217;t know i was up. i stay in my room until 11 am and then go downstairs, and i usually crash in the middle of the day. i don #8217;t do this on purpose, it #8217;s not because of my phone, and it #8217;s not because of any stress at the moment because it #8217;s summertime. after i crash in the middle of the day my parents yell at me and threaten to take away my phone even though it has absolutely nothing to do with this. it #8217;s gotten to the point where if my mom wakes up before i leave my room, she opens the door to make sure i #8217;m in bed and i have to pretend to sleep, and she yells at me and blames me if i #8217;m not fucking pretending. it #8217;s as if they want to see me happy without me being happy. i #8217;ve asked if i could get help and they keep telling me help for sleep deprivation is *all* placebo, which is total bullshit. all i want is for them to understand what #8217;s out of my control.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>given the amount of platforms the game is offered on, it only makes sense. my only close friend that plays Stardew Valley has it on switch and mobile, but i only have it on PC. rather than making the players have to spend money for it on a different device, i feel they should make it easier for different platforms to play together. of course, someone let me know if this is illogical or inconceivable, but i see no reason that this shouldn't happen.</TEXT>

    <DATE>2019-08-19 08:55:55</DATE>
    <TEXT>i spent the past few months feeling nothing at all, but it had just been building up on top of me for that time and tonight it all came out at 2 am, just now actually. my older sister is away at camp and i went into her room. she #8217;s always been rebellious and i found pages in her journal that talked about doing coke and stealing money and shit. i looked through a shoebox of her old stuff and found these old diary pages and photos from years ago and i just felt so alone. i found pictures of a sister that cared about me and loved her family and had dreams. i feel like that girl just turned off. i left a note in that shoebox explaining how alone she made me feel for years and left her room. in my own room, i watched an edit of my favorite song (fourth of july by sufjan stevens, it #8217;s about his mother, his strained relationship with her and her death) to a movie called  #8220;grave of the fireflies #8221; and i just started sobbing. it was the kind of crying i did as a kid where my throat would get congested and my nose would stuff up and my tears would roll on the side of my face to my ears because i was lying sideways and my ears would be wet and my hair would stick to my face like plaster. i tried so hard to be quiet but to no avail, luckily my family was sleeping. sometimes it feels like everything is going away, like inevitably we #8217;re going to die so there #8217;s no point in trying to do anything. most days i #8217;m okay, my depression is mild so breakdowns aren #8217;t frequent anymore, but every now and then there #8217;s a huge rock on a path and my metaphorical bike goes crashing down onto the pavement.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>i #8217;m christian, and i used to go to a bible camp every summer and it was always the highlight of the year. but this year i came out as gay and going to camp was such a different experience. that was supposed to be my safe space but i don #8217;t think i have ever felt less safe in my whole life. i knew nobody could hurt me but i couldn #8217;t guarantee it. every councillor tried to feign acceptance by saying  #8220;these feelings will probably go away #8221; and  #8220;there #8217;s nothing wrong with being gay if you don #8217;t act on it #8221;. everyone gave me dirty looks as i walked by (except those who were actually accepting). i can #8217;t bear to go back there, so i won #8217;t.</TEXT>

    <TITLE>confused about a certain dream i had? sorry if it's poorly explained, i don't remember it perfectly.</TITLE>
    <DATE>2020-05-19 01:02:59</DATE>
    <TEXT>the dream started with me, my sister, and our two childhood friends biking around a random, nondescript town. we were looking for something to do and we stumbled across this sort of virtual reality game i guess? like we literally entered the game, and it was just a basic forest survival game with some type of horror elements. eventually when we got bored of that, we left and started biking around town again. my older sister told us about something we could do and she took us there, and it was just a big trampoline. there was already somebody jumping on it and it looked insanely dangerous, it would bounce you like five metres into the air and there were metal bars around the sides that looked like they could cut your head off if you landed wrong. these two characters from degrassi were there for... whatever reason (Katie and Marisol if you care enough to know). my sister and friends suddenly weren't there anymore, it was just me and these two characters (i was not acknowledging that they were from a TV show at all), and we started arguing about something. it escalated, and i walked away from them up these stairs (they led to a dead end, and you could climb over the wall into a small hidden room) and i climbed over the wall to get away from them. they started to blast their music through a speaker that was near me, to torment me i guess, and i was trying to take the speaker apart so it wouldn't work anymore. i remember crying about this. this is the... concerning part. keep in mind that in real life, i am not a violent person \*at all.\* i'm really pretty unassuming for the most part. i went down the stairs to yell at them, but something took over me and i just started beating one of them up. i was on top of her, punching her in the face, and she was sobbing but i was just furious at her. after i stopped, they both left and i went back up to that secret room for a while but eventually came back down and followed them. i was listening through the door, and this is the only dialogue i fully remember from this dream. i'll be using these girls names from the show, but only for distinction. at this point we started treating our whole group of people as if it were a club. marisol: i'm scared of her! we have to get rid of her. katie: okay, well i'm going to make myself president of the club, and overthrow her so she can't hurt us. (i busted through the door, kool-aid man style, apparently furious at this remark for some reason) me: you're unelected. that's not democracy. \*that's a dictatorship, bitch!\* i slammed her head into the table and knocked over a duplo tower that was next to her (???) and once again went into full on rage mode, beating her senseless for no apparent reason. the door was still open, and i tumbled down the stairs (which i remember being extremely painful) and became aware that i was in between being asleep and being awake. both girls shouted at me to "wake up, before time runs out" and i woke up with a headache that lasted all day. the part that especially scares me is that i enjoyed hurting these girls. i liked causing them pain and while i was "in between", i made a mental note to try beating someone in real life. \*which i obviously will not do.\* does this dream mean anything? update: i had this dream on monday, it is now wednesday, and i still have a headache. longest lasting headache of my life actually.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>ever since i was little, if i really really didn't want to do something, i would get a feeling like "oh FUCK no there's no WAY that's happening" it wasn't even a thought, it was just a feeling of disbelief that something is about to happen. and a lot of the time when i get that feeling, something intervenes and that thing doesn't happen. it was usually something like going on a scary roller coaster or a haunted house or just something that intimidated me, cuz i was a pretty nervous kid. i have no idea if im explaining this correctly. but this "not happening" feeling has almost never been wrong. and that's the feeling i get when i think about my future past the age of 18. this is scaring me more than it should. i'm so scared that i'm gonna get really bad and off myself. i'm not even scared of dying. i don't care about myself enough to be scared. i just don't want other people to suffer because i did something stupid.</TEXT>

    <DATE>2020-06-16 17:26:44</DATE>
    <TEXT>*i am not bashing bi people. just talking about my experiences.* lately i #8217;ve noticed that panphobic bi people loooove to tell me that pansexuality is just a different word for bi or sometimes they even like to bring up the  #8220;original definition #8221; from thousands of years ago about bestiality. it really makes me feel like shit. pansexuality can mean something different for everyone, but for me it means that i can be attracted to every gender and i see the person first (but i tend to be attracted to girls more). but a lot of bi people are telling me that bi has always meant all genders, which i don #8217;t think is true? is that correct? one person even said that it would be transphobic if it wasn #8217;t all, but that #8217;s just straight up ridiculous. that #8217;s like saying only being attracted to men is misogynistic. so yeah, there #8217;s my rant. if i said anything false please tell me, but if you #8217;re going to do that, *please* don #8217;t try to tell me what pansexuality is or isn #8217;t. i #8217;m done with feeling bad about being pan. edit: i just want to clarify, i don #8217;t lean toward girls because of preference, that #8217;s just pattern. i #8217;ve had more girl crushes than boy crushes and i find more girls attractive than boys. no preference, just pattern :)</TEXT>

    <TEXT>i've noticed this over the past month or so (i have a fitbit-i know they're not perfect but i can feel it) that at its most normal my heart rate is 75-80 but sometimes it jumps from that to around 130-140 in a matter of seconds? this lasts from 10-30 seconds and i can feel it through my chest and sometimes i can see my shirt moving with my heart. it's very alarming and super uncomfortable, and it's honestly really scary too. this doesn't just happen when i'm anxious or exerting myself- i could just be sitting on the couch watching TV or playing video games in bed and suddenly i can feel my heart racing. i hate it so much and it's very startling to have happen almost every two minutes sometimes. i'm getting bloodwork done soon, should i bring this up with my ped? the tests are to see if i have low iron or possibly anemia. i'm 15. no heart related medical history in my family. my mom has low iron and has had anemia in the past and she takes iron pills every day. just providing this information in case it's relevant. i don't need a diagnosis, but should i bring this up with the doctor when i see her? is this something to worry about or is it normal? if it is normal, why does this happen?</TEXT>

    <TITLE>first day on vyvanse, this is how it's going :)</TITLE>
    <DATE>2020-08-15 20:47:00</DATE>
    <TEXT>TL;DR at the bottom because i know i would need one for this essay. *my doctor put me on what she called a "therapeutic dosage". that means i have not been medicated for ADHD before and this is a test run before they up my dosage. i am also iron deficient which can make my ADHD seem worse than it is, so medication can be complicated due to the impact iron deficiency can have on the brain if i understand correctly. i'm not very smart but that is my understanding. i am also taking iron pills.* alrighty. so, i'm a minor (f15). my mom keeps my vyvanse under lock for legal reasons. right now, i am taking 20mg but my dosage will be increased before too long, since i'm starting the 11th grade in september. i took my pill at 11 AM this morning, and it is now 2:23. I gave myself a task to do in order to see the difference it makes. so, i started cleaning my room. i cleared and organized my desk, i picked clothes up off of the floor and put them in my laundry basket, took a break for lunch ( i made mac n cheese because i deserve it), and sat down to write this. i also pinned back my bangs because i'm growing them out and they're too long to wear down but too short to just brush away. next up is making my bed, putting away clean clothes, vacuuming and finally touching up loose ends. i was a bit distracted, but that was self inflicted because i'm rewatching icarly for the nostalgia. man, that show is weird. so so good though. i'm rambling. let's talk expectations vs. reality. *expectation:* "i'll have laser focus and i'll get everything done that i need to finish!" *reality:* i'm definitely focusing more than i used to. remember, i'm on a small dose and vyvanse isn't a cure. i'm still easily distracted, just less so. i probably won't even finish cleaning my room, but at least i'm getting far. i probably wouldn't have even started otherwise. here's an example. if i weren't medicated right now, it would have probably taken me about 20 minutes to get as far as i have in writing this post. i started writing at around 2:21, it's now 2:33! and i've barely taken my eyes off the screen. big difference, if i do say so myself. and i do say so myself. *expectation:* "my heart will race and i'll probably feel sick." *reality:* well... no. once again, *small dose.* the worst side effect i'm having is slightly shaky hands and loss of appetite. i couldn't finish my macaroni. weird thing is, i'm hungry. i just don't feel like i want to eat. oh yeah, and about my heart racing; it's not racing, i can just feel it more. not that it's beating faster or harder, i'm just more aware of it. *expectation:* "it might not even work. the dosage might be too low. i shouldn't get my hopes up." *reality:* this one is the most accurate. it *does* work, but it's not life changing. i'm new to medication, not everything will get better instantly. this takes time. in short, i'm glad i started vyvanse. i think it's going to help me a lot in the long run. and now that i know i have ADHD, i'm going to get better at finding ways to manage and control it. i'm less forgetful, i can focus a little more, i'm getting things done, and time doesn't seem to drag on. that's good enough for me right now. TL;DR, i started a small dose of vyvanse and i've gotten things done. it's not quite what i expected, but it's good. i'm happy to be able to manage my ADHD now that i know i have it. thanks for reading, if you did.  lt;3 time of finishing: 2:46 PM.</TEXT>

    <DATE>2020-08-16 00:37:50</DATE>
    <TEXT>my sister (i'll call her M) and i can go months without fighting at all. but every now and then, we have a rough patch, and right now is one of those rough patches. she came up to call me for dinner and said i had to walk one of our dogs, and i nodded but she started going off about how i haven't done "jack shit" today. that's not true, she just didn't see me doing my chores. i went downstairs to feed the dogs and she was taunting me so i started shouting at the top of my lungs about how she has to move out, i said i hate her, i yelled about her making the hall smell like weed, basically i said some really scathing things. i left on my walk and spent the whole walk crying and thinking about it. i probably looked crazy. when i got back my parents had just gotten home and they saw me crying. they asked what was up and i just said "M HATES me." and they made us both sit in the living room to figure it out. she said that what i said hurt her really bad, i talked about how nobody in the family treats me with respect because i'm the youngest and i said how M always approaches our conversations by being malicious and doesn't make an effort to be kind, she refused to believe she did anything wrong, and this went on and we both apologized. when i was walking back to my room, i heard her start crying again and tell our mom what i said to her. i feel like shit. it was so scummy and fucked up for me to say what i did and i don't think she can ever forgive me. the hard thing is, i have more things i want to air out with my family because they genuinely don't treat me like an equal. but that conversation is over and it was my only chance to talk about my problems with them and whenever i try to speak up about what they treat me like, M brushes me off. what can i do? it feels like M expects me to apologize again, but it also feels like she doesn't believe i was hurt either. i can't like me until my family likes me but i just can't believe they do. when i try to speak up about how i'm treated it goes in one ear and out the other but i'm not being listened to. i really do regret what i said but i can't just un-say it.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>i was never mean to her directly. i only talked about her in my circle of friends. it wasn't a strong dislike, she was a good person, i just found some things about her annoying and occasionally pretentious. and she was never bullied (at least, i don't think). she was very open about her struggles with self harm and depression, and i related to her on that level, but we just never clicked. so she ignored me and i acted like a bitch when she wasn't around. her boyfriend died in an accident about a week before she did it. i think that was the straw that broke the camels back. i keep blaming myself even though it's so obvious that i had nothing to do with it. now she's dead. she's dead. she was 16. *16.* one of her final instagram posts was an older picture of her with her boyfriend. the caption said something like "i'll see you soon, when it's my time." and i just keep saying over and over to myself "but it wasn't her time, she was wrong, she was too early, *it wasn't her time!"* i hate to make her suicide about me. i just feel so bad that i never took her cries for help seriously. like, we had a poetry unit in english, and she read aloud a poem that was so depressing that i rolled my eyes because it sounded so immensely cheesy. i got so deluded into being normal that i forgot that some people cope and process emotional turmoil differently from me. and she was feeling such turmoil that she wanted to die. so she did. and i should've been kinder.</TEXT>

    <TITLE>how can i deal with irritating attention-seeker friend?</TITLE>
    <DATE>2020-09-04 02:32:04</DATE>
    <TEXT>so... i really don't know how to explain this without sounding like a complete dick. basically i have this friend who i genuinely enjoy being around sometimes. she's in the higher end of middle class in a white family and she has tried in the past to mention things that would make her seem 'oppressed'. like, she told me once that people of colour cross the street when they see her because she's so pale (which really isn't a thing that happens where i live. source: i'm very pale as well). she has dealt with things that are tough, but i wouldn't go so far as to say she's faced a lot of adversity. she has a history of sort of dropping hints if that makes any sense. we'd be in a conversation and instead of saying something like "sorry, i can't hangout today" she would say something like "sorry, i can't hangout today. i have therapy". me, her, and another friend facetime every day in quarantine and today she kept saying "yeah, i was up all night worrying about my sister" or "i have to go, my mom might have news about my sister". we didn't bother asking her about it because i knew that if i did she would go on a monologue about whatever was happening and probably make it about herself. her sister has dealt with some problems before (mentally) and was hospitalized once because of it, and i can see how that would be difficult to deal with of course, but when this was happening she wasn't really there for her sister. she would just talk about it a lot and really emphasize how she's in so much pain and her sister being hospitalized is so horrible for her personally. as a result of that experience, she claims to have a "suicide trigger". i have this too, and as a result of my trigger i have severe panic attacks and it gets really difficult for me to breathe and i got that trigger because i have attempted suicide on multiple occasions (she knows this). basically, when somebody talks about something bad in their life, she tried to "relate" but it usually winds up becoming a pity party for her. it gets pretty irritating, especially since she can get kind of uppity about facing "so many" struggles (see again: suicide trigger, which she condescendingly explained to me despite knowing that i've gone through it). when i mentioned that i started taking iron pills and vyvanse (for ADHD) she interrupted me and said "i used to take iron pills", and immediately started talking about being hospitalized for arthritis (which had happened about two years ago and wasn't really that big of a deal, nor was it related at all to the topic at hand). i've silently vowed to never try to tell her about my problems because she cannot handle having it better than someone else. she seems obsessed with the world knowing that she's "fragile". i really don't want to sound like a dick. i do care about her, she's just hard to be around sometimes. should i talk to her about this? how can i deal with this moving forward?</TEXT>

    <TEXT>yup. there are like,,, subtypes? of sexism (misogyny and misandry). they both have wildly different affects, and misogyny is much more well known and has what could be seen as much worse affects, they're both very, *very* bad. misandry prevents men from speaking up about mental health and sexual assault while giving women an advantage when it comes to the criminal justice system. misogyny causes lots of body shaming and self hatred in women while reinforcing the idea that men matter more than women. obviously there's much more to it than this, but y'know.

    <DATE>2020-09-17 07:10:05</DATE>
    <TEXT>i got... "diagnosed" with depression two years ago. the reason that's in quotes is because medically, it could not be classified as a diagnosis. my therapist at the time ran me through an assessment, i answered positively for nearly every question, and while i knew that meant that i did have it, she couldn't say that because she was not qualified to diagnose me. my parents always say it was self diagnosed because they weren't there when that happened. i got a new therapist and i didn't explain how i felt very well, so he said it didn't sound like i have it. so now i can't be treated. it feels like i'm faking it. i'll explain it like this: i could be hanging out with friends or on my phone or doing class, and suddenly there isn't any colour. it drains away like an unplugged sink and now everything is black and white. i can't see any colour. was that flower red or purple? what colour was the sky again? the grass? it feels like my brain went into force shutdown mode. people will joke with me or something and i'll give them nothing. i can't bring myself to act like a person anymore. i can't fake it. i don't wanna live. i don't want to exist like this if that's all i'm doing; existing. if i'm gonna be alive, i want to live. i want to enjoy it. i want to be happy. i just want so badly to be happy.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>these people always say "normalize stimming" but then hey exaggerate and misrepresent what stimming looks like. i know i can't speak for everybody, but stimming looks nothing like this for me or anybody i know (and yes, anybody can stim, neurodivergent or not). my most common stim is just rapidly tapping on the bridge of my nose or hitting my feet against each other. it's not random shaking and spasms.</TEXT>

    <TITLE>i think i'm on the brink of an eating disorder and i'm so scared</TITLE>
    <DATE>2020-09-24 03:34:21</DATE>
    <TEXT>for about a year or two, i've had a weird fixation/fascination with eating disorders. i was romanticizing them for the longest time and i still do a lot. i watched that movie To The Bone about a zillion times, i was obsessed with Emma Chota from red band society, i watched and rewatched the ED storylines in degrassi, and i knew everything there was to know about Jenette McCurdy's ED, but in my head i knew i was normal when it came to eating. but one specific day i remember taking a good long look at myself in the mirror and deciding i was too fat. thus begins The Trouble. when night came around and i couldn't sleep, i'd put on a sports bra, fill up a big water bottle, and do situps on my bedroom floor for hours. but i'd still see these eating disorder shows and posts and such and i'd still think "well, i'm being healthy unlike them. i'm working out". but eventually the exercise wasn't enough and i started eating less. for a little bit i counted calories but that took too much work and i didn't like seeing the numbers. in my brain i'm separate from people with EDs. there's a place in my town where (pre covid) teenagers can go after school to hang out, and there's a kitchen and video games and such, and every day i told my mom i was going to eat dinner there after school. then i would tell the workers there that i was gonna eat at home. cool, everybody is satisfied. after a long time of this i decided that i was sick of caring about food and i tried to stop. and it worked! i was actually normal for a while. *for a while.* in july i was diagnosed with ADHD and they put me on Vyvanse. if you don't know what Vyvanse is, it's used to treat BED because it suppresses your appetite. i found myself being super excited to go on these meds. i've been on them ever since and i don't eat anything except dinner. i've lost a bit of weight since going on them. and i do want to be thin, but not like this. i want to be thin and healthy. but now i get so mad at myself for eating. i weigh myself every day but i haven't lost anything in a week. and i still don't think i "qualify" to have an ED because it's certainly not as deep in my brain as everybody says it can be. but i'm getting there. and i don't want to. but at the same time, i really do want to. what do i do? please help me. i'm scared.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>the stuff they wrote is all pretty accurate except the "you can't fake stimming" part. and also the amount of grammar and spelling errors are annoying me but that's beside the point. you can absolutely fake stimming. people who turn on the camera and just start shaking their hands (they all do that for some reason, but there are literally thousands of stims that they all conveniently just don't do), and then stop as soon as they're done filming. and it's a problem. some of them just straight up act possessed, call it stimming, and in turn bring a bad stigma to stimming. they pretend they're helping to destigmatize, but they're doing the exact opposite. for example, i do three different stims. i move my feet in the shape of a cursive 'b', the classic knee bouncing, or i tap the bone just below the bridge of my nose rapidly. i don't know anybody IRL who *legitimately* does the hand shaking stim. i know some people do but it's not like that one is very common.</TEXT>

        <TEXT>today at 5:30 my friends dad went out for a bike ride. he's very close with my family and means a lot to us. he had his earbuds in and t was getting dark. his wife waited at home. 1 hour passed. he should be on his way. 2 hours. she called him. 3 hours and 45 minutes later the police came to the door. they tell her that her husband was hit by a car and was killed instantly. no pain. my friend texted me. "there was an accident. my dads dead" was what she said. i called her and we cried on the phone together. i had to tell my parents because their closest friend just died. my dad was crying. id only seen him cry one other time. my mom came in and i told her immediately. she decided we should go to their house. we did. my friend asked the police "what happened". we all looked on sorta shocked. why did she want to know the details of her dads death? they skirted around it to avoid getting too graphic and she interrupted them with "where is my dad?" so they told her he was being autopsied or something. i can't believe it. i saw him just recently. he was so alive. now he's just not? i'm so fucking angry. he didn't want this. my friend kept making jokes and would pause to cry every now and then. she deserves a dad. she deserves a dad.</TEXT>

        <TEXT>TL;DR, my room is extremely clean and i'm painting it soon!! excited :) i usually try to keep my room clean to avoid the huge day long venture that is tidying up, but i decided it was time for a change, so i pushed my bed and desk to opposite sides of the room, vacuumed, then cleaned the carpets! it took me a day and a half :)) i'm so fucking proud of myself and my room is so clean!!! next up- painting the godawful yellow walls to 3 walls cream and 1 wall eggshell green. i've got some friends to help me with that though.</TEXT>
