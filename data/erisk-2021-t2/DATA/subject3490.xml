    <TEXT>It just another shounen nothing new or interesting about it and it #8217;s also done by studio perriot so the majority of the anime is going to be filler like naruto, bleach and others</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Well imo Im not excited for this movie because it won #8217;t be canon it just there to get extra money that #8217;s all. I probs will just watch it online when the people get it no need to go to the cinema. It be better if they waited to release this movie cause two heroes wasn #8217;t that great imo. It just bland and so many things could have sped that movie up</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I see some of u are butthurted but read this and try and understand what I #8217;m thinking. The thing is I love mha it #8217;s one of my favourite manga and anime but the movie was just poorly done. The second movie will have the same copy paste script with deku saving the day as the same as in the last movie. At least make the movie not about deku and his classmates but about the previous one for all user aka tomura #8217;s mother. Because I won #8217;t be wholly interested in that movie or a movie about other heroes in mha because this movie ain #8217;t going to be canon so they can make as much shit happen in the movies as much as they want.</TEXT>

Yeah u may feel worse without her in ur life but so what we are going to die so if we die sooner or later why does it fucking matter. Just keep on doing the same shit u do like laying in ur bed from morning to night and type out ur thoughts/feelings and show them to someone doesn #8217;t have to be a person u know irl. Show them to a person u met online because it #8217;s helpful to have s second opinion bc they can help brighten up ur day I found a couple of people like that which makes me happy but it #8217;s also a pain though but do it Don #8217;t die yet give it a couple more months or weeks before u decide.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Right I get that life fucking sucks but u can get through the remaining months of this yr. U need to believe in urself. First of all forget about this boy that dumped u after 3 yrs. delete all the memories/photos u have with him bc looking at those will bring back bad memories. Next go and seek help. Go see a counsellor chat to a friend or chat to be on here. Bc I #8217;m willing to give up as much time as I need to help u get through this year. Remember u got 6 months of 2019 left and those months might chance ur life. I tell u this keep cutting urself bc if it helps u don #8217;t stop it. But u need to understand u shouldn #8217;t cut urself bc ur friend lost a relative. By cutting urself u are hurting everyone who cares for u. So if u are going to cut urself make sure no one finds out about bc if they do care fir u it will wreck them. Just try and see how the next few weeks go and just try to be happy even if u have to fake it</TEXT>

    <TEXT>It #8217;s fine bro. It why I wrote the post to think about it and share our thoughts. I agree jotaro is my least favourite character bc he #8217;s too much of a chill character and I preferred Jonathan and Joesph over him any day of the week, but I have to say this jotaro would have won even if dio and jotaro had the opposing stand power bc u got to see the hero overcome the villain which is pretty boring tbh. I want to see a manga where the villain actually wins and see what he does after his rivals are gone. Yeah the stand powers and how they work make no sense but the stands definitely got much interesting from s 4 onwards and the characters were much more enjoyable as well.</TEXT>

Trust me don #8217;t do anything u aren #8217;t comfortablewith just to make friends and fit in. Be urself abd be happy that u aren #8217;t faking it. As for those friends u think are fake get rid of them they just going to hurt u and u don #8217;t want that trust me getting hurt by others hurt more than hurting urself by self harming. But keep w few friends close bc we are a race who need human contact to survive and stay sane even though we know it #8217;s going to hurt us even more.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Callum blue did a good job as zod but he didn #8217;t feel powerful or even menacing enough for me. Felt like everyone followed him bc he was the only person who was taking charge out of the kandorians. He was controlled purely by seeking the powers he should have had from the start but that didn #8217;t make him a good villain. He felt bland in the second half of the season. The Clark and Lois love and finding out secret was great but it wasn #8217;t good enough to make it a good season. Idk why but i prefer when zod possessed lex in s5. Bc that was more entertaining than the final battle between zod and Clark in the finale of s9</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Season 4 was just dull. The magic stuff was not interesting and the only part that made it worth it was knowing the fortress was coming. Idk why but I hated doomsday in s8. The final battle went by too fast and I understand they could do much because they got a budget but damn that fight was so quick. I wanted to see Clark fight like his life depended on it. Zod was bland. We have seen so much of zod in superman movies that idk I got bored pretty quick with him in s9. It #8217;s not a bad show but bc cw has the show there was such a lack of budget that you could tell they were being careful with big fight scenes. Such as doomsday vs Clark. If warner brothers had done that season there would have been a great final fight and proper consequences to it.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I gave up on batwoman but flash kept me entertained so I enjoyed it. Yes the black hole shit was boring as fuck but the first half of season 6 of the flash was great. Batwoman first 6-8 eps had to be rushed to tell her backstory so people knew her befure crisis. It #8217;s the same thing that happened to captain marvel. Both of these characters should have waited until both of those big events ended to be introduced.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Exactly. The slime ring is useful bc slimes are so annoying. But everything else you get ain #8217;t useful at all. And when I defeated the last dust sprite I was looking forward to a great reward bc they are so annoying to find in the game. But no you get a burglar ring which is not useful to me. I have the Irdium band and slime ring any those are the only rings I need.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I hate that the flash seems so dumb. He was relatively smart in season 1 and after that they just dropped his intelligence and just let Cusco and Caitlin be the brains. It seems like he #8217;s not even capable to even use his sired without having someone in his ear. It doesn #8217;t ruin the show but be nice if we have a Barry that #8217;s capable of stuff by himself. Let #8217;s hope superman don #8217;t get nerf we all know he can kick ass and defeat anyone easily. Just use first breath and the game is won. But at last doubt he will use his frost breath at all</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Yep exactly. Like the flash could have ended majority of eps by just outsmarting them and using his speed in versatile ways to end it in 10 mins or even travel back in time each season to arrest the villain at their hideout so they don #8217;t lose anyone. But at last nope. Superman and Lois is fucked. Superman will be thrown around like a rag doll. He be able to get punch to the ground by a normal human. Ugh I think I #8217;m going to skip Lois and Clark or whatever it #8217;s called. I rather just keep on watching and seeing where the flash goes. Even though the flash is dumb that show still enjoyable bc of the characters.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Season 1-3 were good but I think the show went downhill at s4 for me. I couldn #8217;t barely get into s4 and I dropped it at s5 after the crossover bc I felt bored of this show. It #8217;s a shame it #8217;s going bc I would like to see her team up with flash and I was expecting the new batwoman and her to team up more in the future but oh well. Let #8217;s just hope the show has a good ending and they don #8217;t make it a mess.</TEXT>

Bc it be nice to see the cw justice league in action next year. What was season 3 again I forgot tbh. S4 was reign right ? Idk why but super girl villains are just forgettable. Unlike flash and arrow they don #8217;t stand out. Flash villains stand out especially the ones in season 1,2,4 and 6. 3 meh and 5 never happened lol</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Yeah. I #8217;m glad they change show runners in the last season. And they decided to go for two main villains a season. Blood work was great and it was a good set up to crisis. Crisis was a good crossover but I definitely don #8217;t think it was the best one though. I preferred the dominators one. Mirror master is a pretty shit villain so far. Her reasons for being a villain are so bland and nonexistent. She better get rid of quickly in the beginning of season 7. Unless they actually make her interesting.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I mean they got to push iris to a secondary character. She just there and I actually feel in s2-5 no one had no clue what to do with her. And it was all the sane Barry we the flash. The first time was cute and sweet but millionth is just dull. Like I #8217;m glad she actually got some sort of story in s6. But they need to allow Barry to be smart and dumb. Like he #8217;s intelligent. He #8217;s a csi and he knows his shit. So no more crisco idk what to do. I want Barry to think and use his brain like he did in s1. Bc he actually thought if some ideas on how to use his speed and it was good. But now he #8217;s too reliant on team flash. I feel like if they go and die he be hopeless lol. Oh your English and grammar is good. So no worries there</TEXT>
