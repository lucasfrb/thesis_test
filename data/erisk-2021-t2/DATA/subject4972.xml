    <TITLE>Issues with walnut oil on a cutting board</TITLE>
    <DATE>2013-10-20 21:43:09</DATE>
    <TEXT>I have used http://www.woodcraft.com/product/2005223/10578/mahoneys-walnut-oil-16oz.aspx to season the same cutting board for the last 2 years. The last time I tried to apply the oil it didn't dry. It has left a very sticky finish on the cutting board. Does the oil go bad after a while? I didn't see anything about a shelf life. To repair the cutting board I'm assuming I have to sand it(220g?) and then reapply a new finish. Does anyone have any recommendations?</TEXT>

    <TITLE>Anyone have issues with alcohol post treatment?</TITLE>
    <DATE>2013-10-27 16:52:08</DATE>
    <TEXT>I am a survivor(TC 2006, TC 2009) and ever since I had my RPLND it seems that there are certain types of alcohol that doesn't like me. Before my second treatment I would be able to enjoy red wine, beer(killians, bud wiser, blue, Coors, yuengling). As I'm nursing a hang over right now from a single glass of red wine I was wondering if anyone else deals with this. I can drink Guinness, blue light, and it appears some random choices of beer. I almost have to deal with a hang over to try and figure out what I can or can't drink.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>My company pays out vacation pay that you don't use. I get 10 new vacation days January first.(I make about 15 an hour so it is $1,200) If I give my 3 week notice mid December so that my last day of work is January 3rd, could they let me go on December 30th and not have to pay me out for the new vacation days? I'm assuming they could, but that is a lot of money to give out on when I'm not sure how well the new job may be.</TEXT>

    <TITLE>Just picked up the starter pack for Aleph(tips for assembly?)</TITLE>
    <DATE>2013-12-29 17:07:57</DATE>
    <TEXT>I have the starter pack and am looking for some advice on how to assemble the models. I've played W40K, and Warmachine and while I do like the models, do most of them have so many mold lines? The tactbots head seems to have a line going all the way around, and being so small I'm having trouble filing it down. I'm also not sure how to tell if what I need to file down on say the guns. I've been looking at some images on the box and online to try and determine what is and isn't supposed to be there. Any tips anyone has will be really useful. Thanks. *edit* I usually wash the models with dish soap and water before assembly. I've read that some people have had better luck with rubbing alcohol, anyone have an preferences?</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Going to the FLGS tonight to meet up with some others that have painted their starter set. I have the Aleph starter primed and so far this is what I have printed/made: * QSR_ENG.PDF - Quick start rules * QRS-PF-A4.PDF - Printer friendly quick start rules * [en]QRS.pdf - Quick Reference sheet * Army list printed from http://infinitythegame.com/army/ Markers from the back of the QS guide: * 6 regular orders * 6 Unconscious * 6 Wounds * 3 Camo(1,2,3) * Small teardrop * 5xD20 * Tape Measure I did not print/make either the smoke/explosion template I noticed that one of the guides printed it at 125mm and the other at 120mm. I think it is supposed to be 120mm(CD size). See how we do tonight.</TEXT>

    <DATE>2014-01-07 19:59:30</DATE>
    <TEXT>Had a blast the few games I played. We didn't have enough tokens the first game so my opponent used some of the wounds tokens i had made for his orders. We of course didn't have enough terrain on the board and so I lost some units in the first turn. Went and watched some of the miniwargaming batreps for how to play and I won the next few games(we also added alot more terrain, and the other guy actually did guts rolls). So I still have a few questions. looking to expand my army I looked at the steel phalanx starter box. It looks like I can't use any of my vanilla army with the steel army. That is really annoying. How large is the smoke template when i printed out I got different sizes depending on the manual. one is 120mm the other is 125mm. how the the tactbots for aleth deal with guts rolls? Since they are remote presence do they just ignore the guts roll? Where should I look at expanding my army, should i get the support pack or get the steel phalanx and have 'two' armies?</TEXT>

    <TITLE>Tune up of scroll saw</TITLE>
    <DATE>2014-01-10 14:26:54</DATE>
    <TEXT>I picked up a http://www.homedepot.com/p/Ryobi-16-in-Scroll-Saw-SC164VS/100083259#.Us__MvRDuO0 for $30 from HD when they were on clearance a few months ago. I finally took it out of the package and set it up. I adjusted the table and made it square to the blade. When I first turned it on it appears that the blade is moving up and to the right the motion is kinda like / instead of | the movement is slight maybe 1/8 or a 1/16 of an inch but it still seems wrong. I looked for an adjustment on the arm to push it slightly to the left but I could not find a way to adjust it and I didn't see anything in the manual. This is my first scroll saw so I'm not sure what to expect, especially for the price I purchased the saw at. I have the standard tooth blade that came with the system that is bent in the middle and I picked up some spiral blades. Thank you.</TEXT>

    <TITLE>How to negotiate salary</TITLE>
    <DATE>2014-10-06 15:45:07</DATE>
    <TEXT>I am not sure if this is the proper place to put this question. I just got offered a position in a different state for an equivalent position same pay with a small relocation package. They are also offering 3 weeks of vacation. At my current position I receive 5 weeks worth of vacation and I would need to sell my house, which I am in the process of working on and may not be able to finish so I will probably take a hit there. The HR gentleman I talked too said that the positions pay is based off of the other scientists in the company and that they were completely inflexible in offering more vacation days. I know that everything is negotiable, and it shouldn't hurt to ask for another 10k, but I am worried about losing the opportunity. My wife thinks that it isn't enough money, but the new position would have more room for growth and professional development. Any advice? I know that in any negotiation you should be able to walk away from the offer, but I am not sure what to do. Thank you for taking the time to read this.</TEXT>

    <TITLE>Thoughts on making CEOs more useful</TITLE>
    <DATE>2014-10-11 09:07:08</DATE>
    <TEXT>I am fairly far in the game and I've almost got 1700 on the two most expensive properties. It seems that at this stage in the game the CEOs don't actually do anything. After the first few levels so they start buying properties it doesn't make much sense to buy them. The percentage closeness to a perfect click is imo so insignificant it doesn't matter. It is especially true when you have all of the speed upgrades. So what I was thinking was that every single time you buy a level, it increases the time it takes for the CEO to click on a property. This will have a two fold effect. One it makes buying CEOs important, and two it will allow the properties to give more money with out imbalancing the game too much. Just a thought while I check the game every hour and change consultants.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>So I took a job and am moving out of state. My wife and I have recently had to do fixes on our house which has depleted our savings. We understand that improvements to a house rarely make their money back, but we are looking at a major loss. Since we cannot make the money back we are thinking of renting the place our until the summer time when the housing market is more of a sellers market. We are wondering if anyone has any experience with any brokerage firms or property management companies that can watch our place, do minor repairs and screen tenants. It is going to suck that the closest Wegmans is an hour and a half away.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I am looking to improve my painting, and I would like to purchase some models to test paint on before actually painting my real models(warmachine and infinity). Does anyone know of a discontinued game or online store selling a bunch of models for cheap? The models don't have to fit any type of standard(wildwest, fantasy, steampunk, ww2, etc) so anything will work. I'm just looking to test different painting techniques on actual models. *Edit*I just thought of buying a bunch of green army men to practice on. Has anyone tried that, its a different material and I'm not sure it would hold the paint well.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>My wife and I acquired her old high chair from her parents. She would like to spruce it up and make it safe for our daughter to use. It is a Sears Roebuck Model 36005 (D?), and it appears to be solid wood, and some of the glue joints have come loose and were kind of repaired. Whats the best way to fix it? I'm assuming I would need to remove all the hardware(maybe source some replacement parts like the strap and snaps), break the glue joints sand the entire thing down, and refinish it. Is there an easy way to break the glue? I really would like to clean all of the joints and reglue them. http://imgur.com/a/Ei8gD Thanks.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I'm going to be moving to a different area and would like to play some infinity. I stopped by one of the FLGS to see what they had in stock and find out if they were still playing infinity twice a week as their website said. When I talked with the owner he said that they stopped playing infinity because he couldn't get the models in. He said that there was only a single distributor for the models and that even if something was in stock it may take two plus weeks to get to the store if it ever got there. So because people couldn't couldn't get the models they moved back to warmahordes and 40k. So with N3 out, does anyone know if CB has improved their ability to stock FLGS?</TEXT>

He said he only had access to one that supplied infinity games. The FLGS infinity message board seemed really busy 2-4 years ago, but is a ghost town. He did say to me that most of the people that played infinity still have the models and that if someone were to start it up, there may be interest.</TEXT>

If you go to the official site for the download it doesn't include the N2 stuff so people may not know they need to go to the Old downloads section of the website. Hopefully CB will make some all encompassing documents so that people have an easier time to finding the information they need. A simple one would be a weapon document that includes all the weapons in the game, and not having to flip to look through two documents to find out where my weapon is.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>My wife, daughter, and dog and I are looking for a place to rent while we get settled in CT from upstate NY. I will be working in Cromwell so will probably be looking around that area. We looked at a house to rent in Glastonbury and it's probably just the difference between upstate and CT but for 1600 our max budget we were hoping to get more. We would just like a simple 2-3 bedroom house or condo 1-2 baths that is pet friendly. We were hoping to be able to get a place for 1400 but that seems unlikely. I am willing to drive, but I am not sure how the traffic is heading towards Cromwell. Anyone know of a good place to live or any mommy baby groups for an eight month old?</TEXT>

    <TITLE>Dealing with a very dusty basement work shop</TITLE>
    <DATE>2015-07-07 10:40:17</DATE>
    <TEXT>Finally cleaned up part of the basement that has a concrete floor in the 120+ year old house we are renting. Only problem is the rest of the basement is crushed stone/gravel and hasn't been dusted or vacuumed in decades. There is in fact a section of basement that was used for the coal storage back when they used to deliver coal for heating of houses. I am looking at different options for non permanent dust removal. * Option #1 would be a dust system: http://www.amazon.com/Shop-Vac-1030000-Cleaner-Filtration-System/dp/B00004T181/ref=pd_sim_sbs_469_2?ie=UTF8 amp;refRID=0W1TPFEP776JYXGR01T5 That is fairly pricy at 112 with replacement filters at $30. If that is really high quality and I can use it no matter where I move, I may get that. * Option 2 is to find some plastic uchannel and make a box to hold 4 furnace filters for a box fan filter. 4 filters is around $30 replacement and maybe materials to build the system another $50. 1. Option 3 is a washable filter for the box fan for $30 http://www.amazon.com/dp/B00L3DDZQO/ref=wl_it_dp_o_pC_nS_ttl?_encoding=UTF8 amp;colid=9MAHVSMDONTZ amp;coliid=I3GUVQ8LAGJ21C amp;psc=1 I'm leaning towards the third option after I try and vacuum up other sections of the basement. I was also looking to hand some of those plastic freezer doorways to try and keep the dust in the other section. I can't close the door between the workshop rest of the basement because new water pipes and hvac run through the doorway. All those solutions seem to be fairly expensive.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I'm most likely going to be ruining some engineering terms and some EE will blast me for being increadably wrong, but here goes. Very basic overview but there are a few different types of grounds. Ground in a general term means no potential energy 0 volts DC. There is also an earth ground which is 0 volts but can sink an infinite amount of current. On most systems you do not want to connect your ground to earth ground. It can cause issues. If you are doing differential signal comparison(Two wires), while one of those wires may be at 0 volts you also don't want to connect that to a power supply ground because fluctuations on that line can cause erroneous readings. Hence the warning "  gt; "DO NOT TIE (SIG GND) COM OF THE +/- 15VDC SUPPLY TO GND, UNLESS OPTO ISOLATION IS NOT REQUIRE). Not really sure precisely what this means and if I'm in danger of conflicting with it." Page 9 shows that the analog input cards have the same ground. Since they have the same symbol(GND) they are all tied to each other internally. Otherwise I have seen drawings that have 15V1 and 15V2, both of those wires have 15 volts on them, but they aren't tied to each other, so fluctuations on one won't affect the other(switching vs non-switching power supplies).  gt; PID control For the 'base' tune, should I just go with the default settings and then change it after I see what it does to the servos? Also, to avoid a catastrophic crash, I should probably disconnect the servos from the ball screws. Is there anything I should know before I do this? It seems like it's just a matter of unbolting them from their position and letting them rest there disconnected but I don't want to overlook anything there. PID control For the 'base' tune, should I just go with the default settings and then change it after I see what it does to the servos? Also, to avoid a catastrophic crash, I should probably disconnect the servos from the ball screws. Is there anything I should know before I do this? It seems like it's just a matter of unbolting them from their position and letting them rest there disconnected but I don't want to overlook anything there. When tuning PID values you want the entire system to be at average load. There are so many theories and a lot of math, its easiest to plug in some numbers and increase/decrease until you get the response you want. It'll take a while.  gt; Encoder resolution In the 'pncconf step by step guide' it seems like it's telling me to to basically throw some numbers in there and then through trial and error of how much the machine actually moves vs how much I tell it to, determine the resolution of the encoder. Is this really the way it's done? Depending on the system and how expensive(tolarant) the components are, yes. You have to account for gear slipping, and other 'defects' in the entire movement chain, that sometimes its easiest to read the number at one extreme. Move it to the other and read that number then divide by how long it traveled. It'll save you time because the math will most likely not match up.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Do you mean trading in orbs for items or the actual upgrades for the units? I'm not sure the orbs are calculating properly because I purchased a few items, and my DPS didn't change. It may only recalculate that on a reset. Plus I've found just buying the zombie horde is the best, nothing else seems to come close for their dps. also make sure you are opening it from the flash file: http://www.zombidle.com/assets/ZI_FGL.swf it runs so much better.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Think about it this way. You have an equation in a library that is a+b=c, you use c. you notice that the result is actually doing (a+b)*2 = c. C is double what you expected. You now write your code that uses the wrong calculation for c, but you divide it by 2. It now calculates correctly for you. If I go and fix the library and change the (a+b)*2 to (a+b) all your code and all other code that uses the library is now doing the wrong calculation. This happens alot when you have legacy code, or use third party DLLs that you can't change. Fixing the bug in the legacy code may break other sections and you may not know how many modules use that library.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>So when my daughter was born she had to spend some time in the nicu due to issues at her birth. Because of what happened she is at risk for slow development and progressive hearing loss. We have had her initially checked out at six months and a year and she was doing better than average. Motor skills are great and she is running around. Now at 16 months she isn't really talking. It does sound like she says Dada and moma, but those are her only real words. She does make a sound like this/that when pointing at something followed by some whining or grunting. She does understand things like "bring this letter to mommy" or "get your shoes to go outside" or "put this in the recycling". She also can do the find things page in her hello(highlights) magazine. So she does understand. My wife and I are constantly talking to her, explaining to her where we are going and reasons for doing things. And if she wants something and grunts we say use your words and she bubbles differently, so I think she understands. I'm not sure what else we can do right now. We are going to get her reevaluated in a few months but I am so worried for her. I can tell she gets frustrated. Plus she also is using her baby signs less. Before she used to sign she wanted to eat, now she goes and grunts in front of the pantry.</TEXT>

Plus after a few prestige's you don't need to tap at all except to buy your first mercenary.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I kept prestiging when I couldn't insta kill monsters with the shadow(autoclicking skill). Yeah there are a couple humps. I think 75, 300, 500, 800, 1000, and now 1300 for me. I think a the difficult zones are if you have been lucky enough with the fairy bonuses. What relics do you have, the mercenary damage is 10% for each relic spent. Surprisingly a big help.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Every time you reset you get +100% dps, and every 5 resets you get another +1000%. Reset as soon as you can so you can get the dps bonus high. The outfits for the first 5 heroes should go, dps, gold, gold, gold, gold. Use the gems to get the bonus' on the outfits up, but I wouldn't get any to level 5 unless you have alot of gems.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>too bad the million dollar challenge has ended http://web.randi.org/home/jref-status, otherwise you guys could get some money. The way dousing 'works' is that the person uses the lay of the land, foliage, etc to try and predict where the underground waterways are. That doesn't work for the human run pipes. One of the tests they do is they have 3 underground water lines and turn them on or off and see if the dowser can tell which ones are running. As far as I know this has never been successful.</TEXT>

I cut it in thirds and duck taped it together to make it easier to store. When it gets too scratched up, you just get a new piece of insulation.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I thought those were called accessories. I have always heard 'kibble' to be the pieces of vehicle/animal pieces that don't hid well in robot mode. http://tfwiki.net/wiki/Kibble  gt; Kibble is a feature of many Transformers, both in their toys and in their animation/comic designs. In its modern usage (see below for earlier meanings) it refers to pieces which have no clear purpose in one mode but are there only because they are part of another mode. In most cases, "kibble" is used to refer to pieces of the character's alternate mode which "hang" or stick out in their robot mode. Sometimes these pieces are there as a matter of aesthetics, and sometimes it's simply because there wasn't any place better to put the stuff.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I graduated from RIT in 2003 with a degree in computer engineering. I'm not sure how well my experiance will help you, back when I was in school they were on a trimester system with a full year of co-op required. I got a 4 year degree in 5 years. There are lots of very smart professors there, but there was talk a few years ago over the abysmal graduation rate where they were going to make the program easier(I took physics, oo programming and two calcs one quarter) to help more people not drop out. I'm not sure if they did about that. Most of the professors were from industry, it looks like two of my professors are still there. RIT was also a dry campus, not sure if that has changed. Rochester is a fine area if you can deal with the snow. They have lots of Jazz shows and other things to do. If you want to do something you can definitely find like minded people to do it with, from hiking, to hockey, to disc golf, to warhammer, etc. They also have one of the largest farmers markets in the country, great for finding local fresh food or people watching. There also are lots of good pizza shops, garbage plates and great chicken wings. Something I really miss about moving away.</TEXT>

    <TEXT> gt; I was able to go on a run with him when he kinda mistakenly cleared the air about what really went on. He had been fully treated and cured about three months in. He knew it was time, as well as his family, to be honest about it all but they wanted money and glory so they milked the endearing community that had put so much effort in to helping for all they could. Not to rain on his parade, but you aren't cured in 3 months. Depending on the stage and the type, all you are is monitored. I was cured after doing chemo in 2006 with non seminoma, but I was disagnosed again in 2009 with a different type. Also unless you are 5+ years out(unless it was what, stage 1) you are doing multiple scans(xrays, cat scans). At 5+ years luckily I'm down to an xray and bloodtest once a year.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Because it sucks. I was diagnosed with one type in 2006 and another in 2009, both TC. The dread of going to the doctors every few months to get scans that made me sick for the weekend(yay for barium sulfate), is nerve racking. I thought I was 'cure' because I did chemo and they didn't see any traces. A few years later, I get it again. The cost of testosterone if I didn't have insurance is 800 a month for the gel. I'm not sure about the shot, but then you have to give yourself a shot every 2 weeks or find someone who will. And that isn't even including all the blood work, CT scans or Xrays that need to be done every 3 months for the first few years, then every 6 months, until finally i'm down to bloodwork and xrays once a year. It never goes away. This doesn't even touch on the mental damage it did, the possible brain damage from cisplatnin, other medical side effects, the months spent in and out of hospitals, the why me questions. The feeling that you are damaged. I'm luckily to be married now, but the stress the cancer put us through and the difficulty of getting pregant using frozen sperm(another $350 charge a year for storage) and the cost for the medical procedures, no insurance covers iud except I think in Massachusetts. Cancer sucks. I was lucky to find a group http://www.stupidcancer.org/ to help me. But in a group of cancer survivors you will sometimes lose friends to cancer. So while it is good to have someone to talk to, the people you are friends with may not always be there anymore. Sorry for the long rant.</TEXT>

There is a timer on the clicking portion(it starts at 5 seconds per click, but with upgrades and artifacts I've gotten it down to  lt;2 seconds). There are 3 'challenges' 1 is $1,000,000 2 is $1,000,000,000 and 3 is endless. You unlock upgrades and items by completing challenges 1 and 2(it starts around 1 hour to beat 1, but I've gotten it down to under 15 mins). And you beat 3 to get shards to upgrade your artifacts and starting gold. Pretty fun game and you can't really cheat with an auto clicker because of the timer on each click.</TEXT>

Uav's operator determines the response and either a repair truck is sent out or border agents. I see no reason to pay for people standing around on their cell phones.

    <TEXT>It's not really a security question like a password reset or hint. When you ask for your credit score they have to determine if you are who you say you are. So the questions that get asked are related to banking/living. Where did you rent/mortgage from, what was a previous address, what road did you live on in third grade, did you live with this person, what car did you lease, etc. There were 6 questions I had to answer in a row before I got fed up and talked to a person. They still asked me the same type of questions but I got the correct number to verify myself.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Our 12 year old rescue dog has started showing signs of dementia and major anxiety at night. She won't calm down, jumps on the bed, scratches at the kids door waking her up, etc. We have tried anxiety medication but that appears to have stopped having an effect, so we are talking of euthanizing her. She is obviously in a bad place and the vet doesn't think she will get better. What do you say to a two year old? We don't want to say the dog got sick or the dog went to a farm. We also aren't very religious so can't really say she went to live with God. What phrases have you used when this happened to you?</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Instructions Season the onions: #160;Place the onion slices in a 5-quart (or larger) slow cooker. Stir in the butter and olive oil, salt, and a generous quantity of black pepper. Cook on LOW for 12 hours: #160;Cover and cook on LOW overnight or for 12 hours. The onions should be dark golden brown and soft.Add broth: #160;Stir in the balsamic vinegar and the broth. Cook for 6 to 8 hours on LOW: #160;Cover and continue cooking on LOW for 6 to 8 hours. This is flexible; as long as your slow cooker holds moisture well (wrap a towel over the lid if quite a lot of steam escapes), you can cook the soup for hours. Longer cooking will only intensify the flavors. Taste and season with more salt and pepper if desired, and stir in the brandy if using. Portion the soup into oven-safe bowls: #160;Heat the oven to 350 #176;F. Ladle the soup and onions into oven-safe bowls and place the bowls in a baking pan. Top with toast and shredded cheese: #160;Top each bowl with a slice of toast and a generous quantity of shredded Gruyere cheese. Bake for 20 to 30 minutes: #160;Bake on a rack in the upper third of the oven until the cheese is completely melted. Broil for 2 to 3 minutes: #160;Turn the oven to broil and broil the soup for 2 to 3 minutes or until the cheese is bubbling and browned. Remove from the oven and let cool for a few minutes, then serve with chopped fresh onion on the side. Recipe Notes Adjusting Consistency  amp; Thickness: #160;When I have made this the soup has always been just the right consistency. But if yours seems a little thin or watery, you can quickly finish it off on the stovetop by simmering gently in a saucepan for 15 minutes or until the broth has reduced a little. Sorry format is off, I'm on mobile.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Is the market too small or did Pebble grow too fast? A lot of companies want to be the next Twitter, snap chat, etc. The upper management doesn't seem to be happy unless they are making a huge profit. It can't just be a small company making a small profit, it has to keep growing and growing to be the next big thing(tm). I personally feel that if Pebble stayed small, and had half of their product line, they may still be around. But I don't know about their internal interests or their hiring decisions or the internal politics.</TEXT>

If I had found someone 'following orders', its not their fault. I would have had my manager on the phone calling their manager explaining the situation.

    <DATE>2017-02-16 12:18:31</DATE>
    <TEXT>Saw a job posting where they want knowledge of different trouble shooting techniques. I think these are applicable to manufacturing as opposed to software, I haven't seen them before. I'm assuming a lot of you have used these techniques before, does anyone have a simple primer on them? Also I haven't had my coffee so my searching is weak right now. * Red-X I'm assuming is the Shainin: The Red X Company, which looks like it is part of Six Sigma. * The posting also talked about Fault tree Analysis, which a google search found: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fault_tree_analysis * Is the 7 Diamonds related to this: http://www.slideshare.net/pritamde/problem-solving-using-diamond-model, that is only a single diamond and other searches were mostly clothing stores. * Instead of D.I.V.E I have also Deep-Dive but couldn't find the specifics on it other than "an in-depth exploration". Are there any other major programs I should be aware of? I'm assuming most have classes and certifications.</TEXT>

    <TITLE>Guide/FAQ</TITLE>
    <DATE>2017-03-23 17:37:22</DATE>
    <TEXT>#Creature quest guide(with warning): Here is a simple guide/Faq I #8217;m working on. It is not complete, or formatted well and it doesn #8217;t make sense. If you follow it, you will be laughed out of your guild. I would only recommend leveling a 2 dot large creatur if that is your only large and you can't farm for more. If you are farming the large creature, wait until you get a 3 dot until you level/evolve them. # What to spend gems on: 1. Max Energy. Every time you level up your energy gets filled to the max. The earlier you get this the better. I would definitely get the first and second as soon as possible. I #8217;m not sure when it is a good time to get the third. 2. Creature Spaces. You can have a max number of 250. I would recommend buying it whenever it shows up in the special bundles. 3. Epic Multi-summons. Only way to get Boss creatures unless you are incredibly lucky or spending lots of money on gems to win the dungeon tournaments. 4. Bosses in Dungeons. If you lost to a boss(say a genie) and he is almost dead, spend the 20 gems to beat the boss so the next time you run the map, you can use a quick battle coin. 5. Special Bundle quick battle coins. The other bundle I feel is a good deal to spend gems on(first being storage). When you don #8217;t have time, trying to farm a map, it is the perfect item to use. #Creature Preferences. What to level first. Size, then combo dots. The larger the monster, the higher the max level. Also the more stars the better the stats. A 3 star at level 40 will have worse stats than a 4 star at level 40. # Gems xp ammount and gold cost for leveling: * Pristine XXXX xp 25,000 Gold * Huge 25,000 xp 5,000 Gold * Large 5000xp 1000 Gold * Medium 1000xp 200 gold * Small 200xp 40 gold #Genie Quests(Daily color quests). This is where to get the color specific gems to level up your guys. On my server changes every day at 8:00pm EST. * Sunday - gt; Monday: Blue, * Monday - gt; Tuesday:red * Tuesday - gt; Wednesday: green * Wednesday - gt; Thursday: yellow * Thursday - gt; Friday: white * Friday - gt; Saturday: black * Saturday - gt; Sunday: All colors rotating every 3-4 hours. #Special Bundles. Special bundles are triggered when you use up a resource. Resources include energy, battle coins, challenge points, empty creature storage. If you use all of your energy there is a percent chance that a special bundle will pop up on the home screen offering you the ability to buy 150 energy for a discounted price. I would not buy the tokens, tickets or gems. This is the first draft over my lunch break. Will maybe add more to it later.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I'm not sure if the summary I read is correct because people see the word nuclear and get freaked out. It gives the ability for the state to buy up to 50% power from Millstone (8+ Terra watts) at a set dollar amount for the next 5 years. I'm not sure if this is true, but with all of the fracking, gas pipelines, etc gas has caused a lot of power plants(coal, nuclear, hydro?) to be insolvant. Since they are operating in the red, they are closing plants down(I think this happened in NY) and increasing our need for more gas. Then when there is no competition for gas, the gas owners can increase their prices and there would be no one else to buy power from. This was from a rant at a bar after my buddy had a few drinks. So I'm not sure how accurate it is. This is baseload so it can't be replaced by solar/wind until batteries/storage improve.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I came from /all and since you researched climate change, maybe you can answer a question for me. It seems that we have gone from companies polluting(captain planet tv show, etc) to now companies generate climate change. I don't know anyone who thinks that polluting is good, so why was the narrative changed? I think it would help stop the stupid debate about humans causing climate change because it would be about minimizing pollutants.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I apologize, I didn't mean it as a debate like that. As someone from the US I think I mean more of a partisan issue. I'm being incredibly general here and these are my 'feelings' on the subject. The republicans don't believe humans cause climate change, while the democrats believe it does. I do not know anyone who is pro-pollution so if we can get the narrative from 'this company is causing climate change and needs to pay XXX' to 'we need to make sure this company reduces how much it pollutes otherwise they will need to pay XXX'. We can stop the 'debate' on if climate change is 'real' and just focus on reducing how much we pollute. I'm sorry if i'm not using the terms properly, I don't have a background in this and am trying to learn more.</TEXT>

If things turn bad and you start imagining hurting your kid, wife or yourself please seek help. Never feel bad about not getting the instant love for your child. It will come in time. Or if it doesn't please remove yourself from the situation because it will just build resentment. Not everyone is up for the difficulty of being a parent. My child would not sleep by herself for the first year. Now we are dealing with a spectrum issue and we keep saying to ourselves why can't we have a normal child? Why does our kid stay by themselves and not follow the kids when they change activities? Why can't I fix it? I would like to tell you it gets easier but I haven't experienced that happening. It feels like we are going from a fire to a frying pan and we will never be able to have a normal life.</TEXT>

Honestly the only thing I've seen make people care about safety is a rewards/penalties system. If you can figure out who left the pallet there, write them up for being unsafe and require coaching. Or if someone sees a pallet left in the hallway, give them a prize(candybar?) for bringing the pallet to the safe area. I haven't seen people do the Right Thing^TM because it was the right thing to do, just when it was in their best interest. Hopefully it will work out for you.</TEXT>

Most of the time engineers fix problems and have to determine what the problem is from customer requriements. Reading your requirements it stated that people are storing the pallets incorrectly and you don't want them to do that. So an engineer would give you a solution to your problem. If you just want an equation solved, you may have a better time in math, or physics. Not sure</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Not exactly. You stated 2 things. 1. I am a on the saftey team. 2. People are storing pallets dangerously. What else you said is immaterial for the solution because they don't describe the problem or help with finding a solution. And we all have dealt with other people trying to solve the problem 'differently' when there is a simple tried and true solution. If you were curious to know what the calculation was, I would have said "I noticed a pallet sitting on its side in the hallway. What would be the force of impact from the long end if I tipped it over." By stating that you were on the safety team some of us who have worked with safety before saw this as an already solved problem, and gave you recommendations on implementing the solution to keep everyone safe. I'm sorry if you thought some of the responses were rude or not what you were looking for.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>On an aside a Magic number is a hard coded number that is used somewhere in the code. I was dealing with some code where it was building a packet so after a loop it did: packet_size = packet_size + 20; The 20 is a magic number. It did this after 3 seperate loops. When I modified the code I changed it to be: const int std_packet_size = 20; ... packet_size = packet_size + std_packet_size; This way if I need to change the 20 to a 22 or other value, I can change it in one place and not in 3 places.</TEXT>

Maybe if they had someone to teach you, but it seems you may be the fall guy. Management will say, well we hired this guy to fix everything and he lied to us about his skills.

    <TEXT>For the boomer strategy I keep the heroes low level so that they respawn faster and I can use boomers ult faster. For my current setup Vexx is my main damage dealer, especially when she crits with her ult. Lets simplify the calculation and say it takes 5 mins for me to level up everyone a single partial level(33.2 - gt;33.3). Now after 5 mins I can level up Vexx and go from 483- gt;484. Or I can spend 25 mins waiting to go from 483- gt;484(or even longer because Vexx may be at level 30 instead of say 33). For V and Run Emmet, I get most of my money from the goblin lure after a boss. Plenty of time for her to revive and use run emmet 2-3 times. Plus at level 10 she is on a 20second respawn so not that much of a delay, IMO.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I'll try Hilt my next run instead of Lia. With Vexx I can get two ults in before the boss stage ends. So if I can get it down to 25% health, her next ult can kill it without the +dmg. Or I can get lucky with crits and not have to worry about doing a second ult. I may have to respectfully disagree about the speed at killing the individual waves. When I'm currently farming I want to get as high as possible 450+ before it slows down too much. Killing the waves faster reduces the time before prestiges.</TEXT>

There are things that we have dealt with that the other blames them for and we can't rationally forgive. There are things I'm mad at her for and wished she had done differently. There are lies we wish weren't told, and words that both of regret saying. We did couples counseling but there has been much pain, miss communication and difficulties in our life that we can't just stay together because of "the kids". I highly disagree with you on my wife having sole custody. We will be doing the best we can with 50% custody because our child needs both of us.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Probably not accept/court the venture capatilist money. From my understanding(just by watching shark tank) when you accept money from investors, if you aren't making them lots of money by constantly expanding, they will stop funding and working with you. So because pebble has all this VC money, they have to show they are growing super fast, which I believe caused them to over extend themselves, make so many units, have poor QA, etc. So I wouldn't have let them accept all that money which forced them to try to be the next big thing instead of just being a good smart watch.</TEXT>

    <TITLE>Thank you for ghosting me after sex</TITLE>
    <DATE>2018-11-27 17:28:48</DATE>
    <TEXT>Thank you for ghosting me after sex. A little bit tongue in cheek, this is my first time dealing with OLD since I have gotten divorced. Thank you for ghosting me after sex. It had been over 1.5 years since the last time I had been intimate with a woman. I was new to online dating and tried an app my friends were using. I was nervous because I am a late 30s male with a child. Women in my age range are either looking to start families, don't want families, or already have children. I medically can't have kids so the first group is out, I have a child and that won't work with the child free crowd. That leaves the third group. Trying to find a time when both of our families are with the exes is incredibly difficult, no matter how much fun or compatible we are. This was why I was so happy to see a ping from someone close to me who had kids. We started to talking on a Friday and you mentioned that you didn't want to have any more than your two little angels and I got excited. Our first time meeting on Monday was good, I tried to be a gentleman and not a creep. You thanked me with a handshake and our texting exploded over the next few days. It got more and more risqu #233; and with our second date on that Thursday I actually kissed you. You kissed back with passion and our texting started to include pictures with and without clothing. You said you were worried that you were the first person I would be dating since the divorce was finalized and that I should still be contacting other people on the app. That isn't me, I have a hard time keeping everything straight and find it better to focus on one thing, this is something I have to work on. On Sunday, I went to your house. As we were lying in each other's arms after the first time, you were cuddling me and rubbing my arm up and down gently. Something my ex refused to do. You also let me do the same to you, again my ex hated rubbing and gentle caresses after sex. Unfortunately, we started to share. You shared a lot of personal information and aspirations and discussions of your angels and ex. I trying to reciprocate also, and shared too much. We ended up completing the act two more times with you really in to it. But when I got home, the messages were different. The tone had changed. The next morning it was short and tart. Then a request to see you again was rebuffed without a follow-up date. I could see the writing on the wall, but still I sent a message hoping to get the joking and passion back. I ended up opening the app and saw that you were currently online. I just want to say Thank You. Thank you for calling me beautiful. Thank you for showing me that I can still have fun after my divorce. Thank you for showing me that there is someone compatible sexually, who likes to be held and caressed after sex. Thank you for showing me that I can still flirt. Thank you for showing me that I still get clingy and need to work on being a bit more reserved. I realize I have a lot I need to work on, but I can still have fun and there is hope for me to find someone. I realize that with our texting and messages, that type of communication is impossible to keep going at that rate. I should have slowed down, but I was having so much fun and expressing myself I went with reckless abandon. I know it has been less than 10 days, since first contact to no contact. But I will remember the short time. Thank you, for giving me hope.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Thinking about the previous girl I dated and going over the conversations, there was nothing of note about who I am. The conversation was very 'safe' and we ended up talking about our kids and sexting. I am trying to branch my hobbies(will be trying to join a sports club meet up this week), but I don't really have anything to talk about. I have my kid half the time so that cuts our half of the week. I am renting from a family member and all my woodworking stuff is in storage. My free time is spent decompressing from work and watching tv shows/movies (but nothing recent because I miss having someone to watch shows with). I'm not sure I want to talk politics or reddit, so the only thing I can think of talking about are silly questions(what item from your kitchen would you use to take over the world). Is there a good primer on what to talk about that doesn't include my kids? I'll hopefully be able to get move out in a year or two but until then, I'm not sure who 'me' is, and what I have to talk about.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>That's what they do, rocks or water.... https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grid_energy_storage  gt; As of 2017, the largest form of grid energy storage is dammed hydroelectricity, with both conventional hydroelectric generation as well as pumped storage. Alternatives include rail energy storage, where rail cars carrying 300 ton weights are moved up or down an 8-mile section of inclined rail track, storing or releasing energy as a result; or disused oil-well potential energy storage, where 100 ton weights are raised or lowered in a 12,000 ft deep decommissioned oil well.  gt;  gt; Developments in battery storage have enabled commercially viable projects to store energy during peak production and release during peak demand.  gt;  gt; An alternative to grid storage is the use of peaking power plants to fill in demand gaps.</TEXT>

    <DATE>2019-01-05 00:55:22</DATE>
    <TEXT>So I stupidly sent out some texts and learned that I was ghosted because she didn't know how to tell me I wasn't her first choice. I mean it sucks, but I guess I didn't do anything wrong. She had more of a connection with someone else. I'm not sure if its better knowing or not knowing. Maybe I shouldn't have said anything but as the first real dates after a divorce and being new to dating, I couldn't let it lie. Oh well, I deleted/blocked her number so I can't make that mistake again. I almost wish there was something I did wrong so I could point to that and feel better.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>You kinda hit the nail on the head for why they have women only groups. Sometimes some people want to go and do their hobby without having to worry about being hit on. Don't do the groups to meet someone, do the groups because you enjoy the hobby. You'll be more attractive and have more confidence if you are there to have fun and not impress anyone. I started to go to an open sport league before the new year. 17 guys and 2 women(who aren't attractive to me) show up. But I'm there to have fun. Two days ago there were 7 increadably hot women there. But I didn't hit on any of them or try to date them. I just made small talk and a few jokes about what was happening. I don't know if these women are single, gay or married. But what I do know is we both enjoy having this sport in common and we are having fun. I heard some regulars there talked about going to a bar afterwards, and they invited me to go out. I may do that next time but I didn't feel ready. But that's what you have to do. Go out and do hobbies that you like. If you make new friends great. If you just have fun great.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I've been thinking about this the day since I read it. I'm not sure how I feel about 'being' a plan b. I could see two types of scenarios. 1. She is always on the lookout for the next best thing and is always willing to put me on hold when someone who is healthier, more successful, less kids, taller, etc comes around. 2. She didn't want to date/sleep with multiple people and he beat me out because reasons, but it didn't work out for them, and now she wants to try with me. I could see myself being plan b for someone for maybe 2 times, but anymore and a relationship is a no-go. Maybe a possible fb, but I've never done that before. But if someone messages me 3 months later and her relationship didn't work out, I'd be willing to try again, albiet I'll be on guard and if it seems like I'm not a dating priority, I'll split. But I have chosen the wrong women between two before and I'd want a second chance.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>If you are willing to share your cancer diagnosis, it may be helpful. I had male reporductive cancer and the treatments have left me sterile. I mention in my profile, that I have one kid and would be ok with fostering/adopting more and hopefully they can read between the lines. I also have put the max age i'm looking for at 45, because I feel that woman of that age may not be looking to have biological children. As to dating someone going through treatment. It depends. When I was doing my chemo, I was competely spent afterwards. For however long I did my treatment, I was a zombie and I needed a parent to move in with me to help get me to treatments, cook, etc. I could not work during that time. Talking with some women who had breast cancer, their treatment was a small little pill that didn't have the side effects that I dealt with. They were able to work and care for themselves. Then again, during my treatments and afterwards I joined a few cancer groups and watching the cancer come back and kill some of my friends was so very very hard. As to when to bring it up. I try to do it before the third date. I know health/kids is a major dealbreaker for some, and I want to be honest. Maybe I should put it in my profile, but that seems to personal. Sorry for the long rant, I wish you the best and if you figure out what works for you, please let me know.</TEXT>

    <TEXT> gt; however I was able to bank before treatment began Good luck with that. I banked also but mine was non-modal and not having being able to have multiple kids was a major issue on why I got divorced. Albeit possibly don't date someone with reproductive cancer if you want to have lots of kids, it's not their fault they got sick(sorry still bitter). Yeah, I personally can't fault someone for not wanting to be a caregiver. I had someone break up with me when I started my treatments for the first time I got cancer, and I am ok with that.</TEXT>

So when I saw that someone had in their bio 'prefer dad bod' I started the conversation off with "we prefer to call it a father figure". Then I got the response of "we can't call it that because father figure means a venerated male role model" that went on for way too long. no sense of humor what so ever.</TEXT>

I've been ghosted by someone because they were talking to someone else after we had just started being intimate. I dislike that it feels we always have to be talking to others and making plans with others because when you do get ghosted, it just sucks.

There is a higher degree of ghosting/not responding, so to me it feels like if you aren't talking to multiple people its very easy to go from having fun talking to someone, to being alone talking to no one. But that's as a guy. It's even changed my mind about being plan b. If a woman I'm talking to wants to get more serious with someone else, but that doesn't work and she wants to start chatting with me again, that's perfectly fine. If it happens again, then I see it as a pattern and move on. We've all made mistakes and don't know a person and dealbreakers can come up at any time.</TEXT>

We met with her and it was akin to a couples therapy session where we talked about how to raise the kid, techniques on working together. She also gave us a book "keeping kids out of the middle" that was helpful. Well what my ex wants, vs what the state guidelines list out are different. It doesn't matter what she wants is unreasonable, the state won't force me to keep a 1,000,000 life insurance policy if my total child support payments until are only 150,000.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Well it depends on what you expect her to forgive you for and what actually happened. I've got 10 years or so of constant lying to 'forgive'. She stated that I kept living in the past and she had changed when she was constantly doing the same thing. Depending on what happened it may not be possible for her to move on. Or she could be holding on to something idiotic. And would you honestly want to be with someone who doesn't want to work on the relationship with you?</TEXT>

So what topics does she talk about? Are you having a hard time making small talk? can you hold a converstation about interesting things that happened during her day or in her life? What about her dreams, passions, what happens when you discuss them? Don't put this all on you. She has to want to keep the marriage going.  gt;I think I killed my marriage and now I can bring myself to do what I think is right and leave. She's said some horrible things to me but I've done the same and in my frustrations I even told her we shouldn't be together, we have nothing in common... I don't think she is being nice/fair to you.  gt;I've asked her about a therapist and she said no and we can't afford one either. I either work on whatever is eating me or I leave. She is definitely not being nice or fair to you. How can you work on something if you don't know what it is or being told from a professional how to work on something?</TEXT>

Asking people out is a numbers game and most likely most of the people that you like in that way, don't like you in that way.

    <TEXT> gt;This morning I apologized profusely. He assured me it's ok, he understands completely and then called me on his way to work so I could hear in his voice that he wasn't upset. He did say it was awkward.  #128532; It was awkward. That is a true statement, but he knew the risks going over there. As a single dad, I understand and personally would be too worried about something happening if I was over at the womans house.  gt;I wanted to tell him that until he's officially "in" with my kids, it might be better to spend time at his house if we aren't out. That way if they wake up, they have a familiar face (their uncle or grandmom.), there won't be awkwardness and we wouldn't have to abruptly end our time. Is that unreasonable? Not unreasonable at all. For me I've had to stop many relationships before even the first date due to scheduling conflicts. Whats the point of dating someone if you never see them. That's been the hardest part.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Yes answered your question. It is a red flag because you are trying to hide and lie about who you are. Using pictures from 5 years/50 lbs ago is wrong. Hiding who you are is wrong. Would you prefer the guy to swipe left and not talk to you, watch his face drop the second he sees you in person, or have him ghost you after spending time talking to you because he feels like you lied to him. I did the last one. If a woman can't be honest and show me pictures of herself I now know the to swipe left. I regretted going on a date with someone who doesn't fit my type. I could have been home reading, hanging out with friends or on reddit. Instead I'm on a horrible date with someone who can't tell me the truth.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>But we said we regretted going on a date when that person didn't have a full body picture, If you can't understand from that sentence that yes you should have a body picture, I'd worry about the other persons communication skills. And honestly, One way to attract the people you are interested in, is to write your profile that people who aren't interested in you will swipe left. I mention in my profile that I have a kid. I don't want to waste my time with people who don't want to date a single dad. If someone says they always swipe left if she reads that he has a kid, then that's awesome advice for me. It means my profile is working and we aren't wasting time.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>So the just handed the EX an alimony lump sum of $5k check and $95k funds from 401k. And I'm pissed about it. During our marriage she was horrible with money. She 'forgot' to pay the IRS and so I had to pay her taxes owed and 2 years of fees, had to pay off multiple debt collectors and bills that she just didn't have money for during our marriage. I'm very angry and I'm not sure how to get over it. I don't know how I'm going to retire, and I have no money saved up because of the debt we had gotten in to the final few years, and the lawyer fees so I could get custody of my kid. It's very frustrating and I'm not sure how to let it go. *edit* I also didn't want to add, but she found a new boyfriend who drives a tesla and he is selling his house and they are moving in together to be in a good school district for my kid. Afterdating for around 7 months. I'm also bitter about that because I feel I can't find a date. But I'm very bitter and until I can let this go, I'm in no stage to date. I'm trying to be happy because without him, my kid wouldn't be going to a good school system.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Divorce has been over for 3 months or so, finally went over to pick up the kid at her new place that she just moved in to. She told me she was renting, but apparently her boyfriend bought it a week ago for them to live in after selling his place. Now I'm living in my parents basement trying to rebuild my life, and she is living in an awesome 2000sq 400K house in the suburbs. What the fuck. When she was with me, she refused to get a full time job. She refused to help pay for daycare/preschool(1500 month), I paid off her tax bill and multiple debt collectors. Then when the divorce was final, I have to take on a majority of the child care expenses(50/50 custody, but she still gets 1k+ month) and she took a huge chuck of my 401k(she never contributed to hers because she never had any money to save). It just seems so unfair. She has lied to me multiple times during our marriage(mostly about money saying she has paid off the bills, but then I get a call from a collection agency asking for money). I don't lie to her, I try to treat others as I want to be treated. I feel that she has done a lot more 'wrong' in her life, but yet, she gets to live such a perfect from the outside life right now. It's really depressing, and making me bitter.</TEXT>

    <TEXT> gt; We spoke yesterday for a bit regarding our kids and moving forward and during a good chunk of the conversation, she failed to listen to what I was saying. Did her usual  #8216;reword #8217; what I was saying and tried to turn it against me. Tried to get angry over something I never said and was literally the opposite of what I said. It's hard. Everything my ex says to me I can't trust. Every little thing is a lie. And the reason she tells me and the counsolor we see for our kid is because I'd get irrationally angry and upset so she has to lie to me. I get very upset with lying. She has done it our entire marriage, even before we started dating she used words to imply something without it being true, but according to her, I never said it. It was just heavily implied.</TEXT>

I personally wouldn't go to a prostitute, but if you feel that's what you need. Masturbation isn't wrong. it's ok to look at porn. Like most things, if looking at porn starts to interfere with relationships, work, etc, then you may have an addiction and should probably stop. Do you have a therapist? Someone to talk to?</TEXT>

    <TITLE>How do you express texting frequency?</TITLE>
    <DATE>2019-10-29 00:43:25</DATE>
    <TEXT>So apparently I waited too long to text someone back and upset her. Had 3 really awesome dates and multiple cool phone calls. Had a tentative date planned for Thursday depending on her schedule that she was going to let me know about. But that has all changed. She sent me a good morning text and I texted her when I had a chance at dinner 8 or so hour later. She sent me a message that she thought she had been ghosted. I tried calling her the next day and it was a very quiet non typical conversation. She said she felt stupid for believing I had ghosted her and misreading the situation. This is of course after she had canceled our planned date. So I don't know, I tried to talk about texting frequency and she then stated that she wanted someone who cares about her to message her and she obviously read the situation wrong and felt stupid. She doesn't want to make rules about texting that you have to text X times a day, but she also wants to feel that I'm thinking about her. I dunno, maybe she had a bad day and this was the last straw, or maybe I was bound to do something else to set her off. I understand wanting to be thought of, and maybe I should have sent a quick "super busy" at lunch, but that may have only delayed the inevitable. Is there anyway to try to head this off in the future? How do you guys handle discussing texting frequency?</TEXT>

It's heartbreaking and the people you want to talk to ghost you and the people you aren't really in to are really in to you. Hurts all around. What is your custody schedule like? I have 50/50 so I'm able to go out on a Friday/Saturday every 2 weeks. That sucks and there is no spontaneity in dating, everything is planned. I've had better luck dating divorced women, but still even one of them that I was really in to told me, "My kids are past the early stages of being sad at the divorce, I don't want to see your kid go through that(being sad about the divorce)". I mainly focus on my kid when I have them, they have 100% of my attention and my free time I try to plan a date. I also take breaks for 3-6 months at a time when it gets really frustrating.</TEXT>

I was not a big fan because I'm not that religious anymore and the bible verses, and "you've sinned unless you got divorced because of a cheating spouse or a non-christian left your marriage" left a bad taste in my mouth. I made it about 6 or 7 sessions. The people were very nice and supportive, but it wasn't for me. *edit* Link in case it may help other divorcees https://www.divorcecare.org/</TEXT>

I've been catfished a few times by woman who have pictures from 50+lbs ago. I wouldn't have minded going out with the woman in the pictures, but not the person I met up with.  gt;Guys who wish you were cuddling with them 5 minutes into the conversation. Sounds like you had nothing in common and possibly they were looking to at least get laid if they weren't enjoying the conversation. Could you give an example? I've said before "On these rainy days I enjoy cuddling up under the blankets and reading a book, but that's definitely more fun when you can share it with someone".  gt;Guys who ask you to hang out after exchanging a few messages. How many messages. If we aren't meeting after 2 weeks when our schedules match up(both of us have kids 50%) what's the point in continuing the conversation if you don't want to get to know the real me, not the keyboard warrior.  gt;Does those things actually work? Are women into that? Am I the exception? I just find it so off putting when a man is so forward. Depends on the guy, but yes, that stuff does actually work for a very small percentage of the population. I'm not in that one</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I was seeing this woman before quarentine and I think the relationship has run its course. Before quarentine we'd see each other 2 times a week, alternating the 1.5 hour drive between us(both of us have kids and that's when our schedules meet up). It would be dinner, movie, sex then parting ways. The movie choices wouldn't be my first choices. There also was she didn't seem to have any passions or hobbies. I understand being a parent comes first, but when all you do(before quarantine) was watch netflix and read a book here and there. No real hobbies or passions. at the start we'd text every day, but now it seems that we text maybe once a week and its a 'how are you' 'was your day good? yes'. No real conversations not that there is anything really happening, but still. I think I should call her to make a clean break, but we don't really talk on the phone at all, mostly text. I'm not sure what to do.</TEXT>
