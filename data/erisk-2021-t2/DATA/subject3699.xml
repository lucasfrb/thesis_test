    <TEXT>i am going to get ps5 but for the first 2 years i'm only going to play ps4 games because of the fast loading times, i missed out on ps4 and didnt get to play any ps4 gamesz so i have a big catalogue to go through. also ps4 AAA games are really cheap now so i will also save a ton of money, but the main reason is i am so excited to play uncharted and spiderman and such with barely any load times. by the time i feel like i should move on to ps5 games, the games that will release within two years now will be cheap by then so allot more savings since i am currently tight on money. anyone else on this train?</TEXT>

    <TITLE>hey r/pakistan, what Is people's view on Imran Khan?</TITLE>
    <DATE>2020-05-24 21:56:32</DATE>
    <TEXT>okay so i read on another subreddit (on r/murderedbywords about shahid afiridi boasting about reading namaz) that imran khan is a lovechild of the military of pakistan and has essentially been propped by the military from the beginning so the military has the power and is now doing the same by propping up shahid afridi for the future. from my little understanding i thought imran khan was a leader of people and good for his country. what is non resident pakistanis view of him, is he genuinely good for the country or more of a fake populist. where does he fit on a specturum of say bernie sanders to trump. i mean no offence to his supporters or non supporters and i have no informed view on him so upfront apologies if i have offended or seem patronising.</TEXT>

    <DATE>2020-07-15 12:28:21</DATE>
    <TEXT>I think that is a great achievement in story telling, the emptiness doesn't come from a unsatisfying ending, but because of the grounded and lonely feeling that I have for Ellie, she lost everything and us gamers lost what we're attached to in the first game. I think the game achieves exactly what it set out to do, and make the gamer fill with hate and emptiness just like Ellie, she lost everything in turn makes the audience feel the same because of the story choices and for that reason I think it is a masterpiece of story telling. the fact that she let go of her revenge and therefore could not have her revenge makes me feel even more empty because of her, at the end she her character feels like she is empty and has lost everyrhing. this is a post apocalyptic world and the story captures it perfect that is not a romanticised good feel situation in the in-game reality and that such a world is brutal and for that I hate the last of us part 2 out of love. it truly is one the greatest games of all time like the godfather and godfather part 2.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I work all week and and live pay check to pay check and do extra hours so i can save up to buy games. if i have invested years of my life in a console or platform working hard and buying it, damn right i am gonna root for the thing that i bought is better and want it to win over its competition. also if i am argueing with someone over why the game and console i have is better, i am not hurting, threatening condoning violence, killing someone, its a harmless activity with strangers online and I enjoy the little conversations with a fellow human being. i dont get why people get so triggered if someone talks about what they like and think its better. sure it can toxic, but that word is thrown around so much, even if u give a valid reason, u are called toxic instead of a convo, like its not that serious, just making conversation. people generally dont wish the person bad health and just talk about a consumer product and not get personal. then someone comes along and calls you toxic.</TEXT>

    <TITLE>Girls Are Flesh like yourself</TITLE>
    <DATE>2020-08-01 22:31:04</DATE>
    <TEXT>so I just met up with my girlfriend and kissed her for the first time, this girl i had masturbated over for years because i had allot of her pics since we have been friends for long. my view of girls from years of porn addiction had been that their flesh was the way heaven, even if i touch them i am probably gonna cum and wet myself, even if i just touch their lips id cum. but when i was kissing my girlfriends lips and her neck and all, it didn't really feel all that, it just felt like normal skin, and i thought to myself while kissing her, how have i wasted years of my life thinking it was different. it didn't feel any different that my own arm flesh just on another human being. there i was kissing and touching the girl who i had dreamed of for ages and i wasn't even aroused, thats when it hit me that girls are just like yourself and me, years of porn had made me believe they must feel so good, at least better. i am actually dumbfounded right now over how much i have wasted fantasizing about the female flesh and here i am now at a totally different mindset after expriencing it. just wanted to share this that women are not sexual objects as porn has made you and me believe, they are just like you and me made of normal flesh and one should always be looking for personality and character. porn makes you fantasize about things that are not real, porn is an addiction and disease that we should fight against.</TEXT>

Does it ever occur to them that the end of their own life may be near (hence the time to make the right decisions is not unlimited)? What HADITH besides the Qur'an, are they going to believe after him? 7:3- Follow, [O mankind], what has been revealed to you from your Lord and do not follow other than Him any allies. Little do you remember. 6:114- Shall I seek a judge other than God, when He is the One who revealed to you the Book, explained in detail?' Those to whom We gave the Book know that it is the truth revealed from your Lord. So do not be of those who doubt. 6:38-  #160;There is not an animal (that lives) on the earth, nor a being that flies on its wings, but (forms part of) communities like you. Nothing have we omitted from the Book, and they (all) shall be gathered to their Lord in the end. 33:62 12:111 46:9</TEXT>

    <TEXT>so my renault clio's brake is sinking isnt sturdy anymore, me and my friend did the bleeding and it became very stiff, however by the time we put the tyre on and tested it driving, it was sinking again. and we also broke the bleeding valve inside after tightning it. does the stiffness mean that the brake master cylinder is fine and working and there is other problems? i am trying to find the source of the leak, so if the brake was stiff does this mean the master cylinder is ok if it was stiff for a short period? thanks</TEXT>
