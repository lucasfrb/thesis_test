    <TITLE>To use a VA IRRL or not?</TITLE>
    <DATE>2018-03-21 22:11:13</DATE>
    <TEXT>Hi everyone, first post here, been lurking and found Reddit has some awesome advices, so here goes. I bought my first home in Sept 17 with an APR at 3.99% and monthly principal + interest is $3140. Since I used a VA loan, I kept getting mail from other lenders offering a VA interest rate reduction loan (IRRL). According to these letters, I could potentially save ~$500 monthly. This is my first home and not my forever home, I #8217;m planning to move in 2-3yrs from now. I #8217;m thinking $500 monthly is worth the switch, I know I #8217;ll lose the interest I #8217;ve been paying in the last 6 months but saving $500/month is tempting. What do you guys think?</TEXT>

    <TEXT>The fine prints from the mails I've received said that these are 3/1 hybrid loans with the first 3 years being fixed and the rest adjustable. The rates can only go up 1% each year with the max of 5%. I have USAA and was thinking of getting these quotes then calling them last. I really like USAA.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>One of my friends recently visited the cave. Admittedly, I #8217;m not sure how much they charge nor how big they are into actually conserving the caves, but it seems pretty easy for a layman to book a tour. I agree on how tourism helps the people in the region, somewhat...as I #8217;ve seen/experienced corruption first-hand while traveling in Vietnam, seems like ALL government officials need to get greased as part of their income/way of life. So I #8217;m sure a lot of the money made does not go directly to preserving the cave nor to the local people. Source: also Vietnamese and grew up in that country</TEXT>

    <TITLE>Father-in-law was involved in a 8-car pileup..what do?</TITLE>
    <DATE>2018-10-09 22:48:53</DATE>
    <TEXT>Happens in Bay Area, CA. So a couple weeks ago, my FIL took part in an accident that involved 8 cars. His was the 4th car, he managed to stop just in time but the car behind him rammed into him and pushed him into the car in front of him. He took pictures and they showed minimal damage to the rear bumper of the car in front and severe damage to the front of the car behind him as well as his rear bumper. My MIL, BIL, and FIL were all in the car at this time. Needless to say, they were pretty shaken up. Their English isn #8217;t very good, so they didn #8217;t make it clear to the officer doing the report that they were pushed into the car ahead and that they stopped in time. So the police report came back saying that the SECOND car was the cause of the accident and everyone behind were partially at fault because they were driving too fast for current conditions. Now my FIL only has liability on his car because it #8217;s an older car. And HIS insurance won #8217;t cover damages since he doesn #8217;t have collision coverage. The insurance broker told me that according to the police report, everyone #8217;s somewhat at fault so pretty much everyone #8217;s gotta use their own insurance for their loss and that there was no use of making a claim with the insurance company for the guy behind my FIL. My question is, is the broker #8217;s advice sound? Are we pretty much screwed? Should I file a claim with the guy behind or the guy that was the cause of the whole thing? Appreciate all the help guys!</TEXT>

"What a wonderful answer!" the nun said. Little Johnny raised his hand and said, "Sister, I think its your legs". The nun looked at him with the strangest look on her face. Now Little Johnnie, why would you think it would be your legs? Little Johnny said,"Well I walked into mommy and daddy's bedroom the other night..

    <TITLE>It has taken over 2 months for Sears to fix my fridge, AND it #8217;s still not working properly! What do I do??</TITLE>
    <DATE>2019-08-28 19:52:55</DATE>
    <TEXT>Located in Bay Area, California My Kenmore Elite refrigerator stopped working, things weren #8217;t cold, ice maker not producing ice, in early June, I called and got an appointment for a tech, one was scheduled to come out late June. They tech came out, ordered parts, then set up the next appointment, which was two weeks later, here #8217;s a break down of the timeline: -6/20: tech came out, diagnosed the problem, ordered parts, scheduled for 7/3 -7/3: tech apparently called in sick, rescheduled for 7/5 -7/5: tech installed new parts, said all is well, give it 24hrs for things to run properly. Things did NOT run properly, still! Called back and got another appoint for 7/19. -7/19: tech came out, diagnosed problem, ordered more parts to the house, next appointment scheduled for 8/5. -8/5: I got a notification that the appointment had been RESCHEDULED for 8/20. I called and was really upset because we have gone over a month with no refrigerator and I had no idea why the appointment was rescheduled. Sears told me that the service needed a senior tech because it was a big job, the tech that was assigned the job couldn #8217;t do it. They assured me a senior tech will be the one coming out next appointment. -8/20: senior tech came out, installed new parts and said everything is now in working order, give it 24hrs to be 100%. I normally set my fridge to 0*F for freezer and 37*F for fridge, but I notice the tech set it to -4*F freezer and 34*F fridge, maybe to get it working faster, I don #8217;t know. I gave the fridge a few days at that setting then turned it back to the settings I normally set it at. Then placed some ice trays into the freezer and put the ice maker on  #8220;super ice #8221; mode. At 0*F setting, the ice trays were not completely frozen, the surface was but I could see water move at the bottom, and this is after a day sitting in the freezer. I #8217;m going to buy a thermometer to get the actual temperature of the freezer and fridge. Ice maker is still not making ice. During the several phone calls to Sears during the two months period, I was able to claim food loss, get money for a mini fridge, and an inconvenient check, totaling about $415. I called today and after nearly an hour waiting with that elevator music, I got the  #8220;earliest appointment #8221;, for 9/16. I was told the refrigerator does not qualify for a replacement because there had been only 2 services with qualified parts replacements and I need 4 in a 12 month period. This is driving me crazy!! It #8217;s going to take 3 MONTHS to hopefully get a working refrigerator!?! In the mean time, we cant grocery shop like normal, can #8217;t have too much leftovers for lunches the next day, 3 of us in the family usually pack a lunch for work! How do I solve this Sears problem!? Please help!!</TEXT>

    <DATE>2019-11-01 18:18:47</DATE>
    <TEXT>Location: Bay Area, CA So I work at a hospital, when I was hired on, the offer letter stated a specific rate, which I thought was somewhat high, but I figured due to my experience/skill and that I #8217;ve worked at that hospital before, they really want me there. Now, a year later, I #8217;ve done enough hours to advance to the next step on the pay scale ladder, HR informed me that the recruiter made a mistake on my job offer. I should #8217;ve been at a much lower pay scale, like $10/hr less. She said she needed to do some research, but for sure I won #8217;t need to pay back anything. Can they put me at a lower pay scale or can I argue that since the offer letter had that number then I #8217;d like to stay at that pay? This means I won #8217;t advance to the next step, but it seems that even the next step is lower than what I #8217;m currently making. Thanks for your input!</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Hello r/watchexchange, Up for sale is my Rolex Datejust ref 16013 with a gold linen dial. It is an 8mil serial watch, which dates it to 1984-1985. The hands and lume dots have nice, matching patina. As you can see, the dial is phenomenal when the sun hits it. It comes recently serviced and with a B amp;R leather strap. It will not come with any papers nor box, but will be securely packaged. There are scratches and scuffs commemorating its age. I tried to take as detailed pictures as I could to show them. It seems the case had been lightly polished before but lugs are still nice and sharp! Conditions: - excellent, pre-owned Dimensions: - case: 36mm - strap: 20mm lug width, I got the small band from B amp;R but should fit up to 8 #8221; wrist? SOLD SOLD SOLD Price/shipping: - I take PayPal (please add 3% if using G amp;S), Zelle, or bank wire. Once paid, the watch will be shipped via USPS Priority. I #8217;m looking to make the sale CONUS for now. Thanks for looking. Please feel free to reach out to me with any questions!!</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Well, like most people who started in the rep game, I couldn #8217;t justify paying that amount for a watch. I #8217;ve heard high end reps are really close to the real thing and decided to give it a shot. And the reps were REALLY close, as you probably have read/heard, that to a point where an average person would need a rep and a gen side by side to differentiate. But, there WERE tells, so I didn #8217;t settle. I got into Franken watches, where reps have gen parts, and those were even HARDER to tell. But in the end, YOU always know that the watch you #8217;re wearing isn #8217;t genuine. That feeling didn #8217;t sit well with me, as the more I researched Frankens, the more I appreciate genuine pieces. And this is clich #233;, as you #8217;ll hear it from most people who switched from reps to gens, but the feeling of rewarding yourself a Rolex when you #8217;ve achieved a certain milestone in life, is an incredible feeling. Having the watch on your wrist reminds you of what you are able to achieve. Life is a learning experience. I don #8217;t regret starting with replicas, as I think because of them, I can really appreciate genuine pieces. Best of luck on your journey in life, friend.</TEXT>

The hands and lume dots have nice, matching patina. As you can see, the dial is phenomenal when the sun hits it. It comes recently serviced and with a B amp;R leather strap. It will not come with any papers nor box, but will be securely packaged. There are scratches and scuffs commemorating its age. I tried to take as detailed pictures as I could to show them. It seems the case had been lightly polished before but lugs are still nice and sharp! Conditions: - excellent, pre-owned Specs: - Rolex calibre 3035, 27 jewel - 50-hr reserve from factory, but may change due to age - Running strong and seems to be pretty accurate Dimensions: - case: 36mm - strap: 20mm lug width, I got the small band from B amp;R but should fit up to 8 #8221; wrist? SOLD SOLS SOLD Price/shipping: - Asking $3050 net to me - I take PayPal (please add 3% if using G amp;S), Zelle, or bank wire. Once paid, the watch will be shipped via USPS Priority. I #8217;m looking to make the sale CONUS for now. Thanks for looking. Please feel free to reach out to me with any questions!!</TEXT>

So, I give you one of the best priced 16233 Tapestry Dial out there right now! SOLD SOLD SOLD Condition: - Exceeellent! Minor scratches and scuffs, nothing major. You can tell by the Rolex Crown on the clasp that the watch hasn #8217;t been polished much - Crystal is perfect, no nicks, dings, chips, or scratches - There is a little itty bitty dent by the crown - Bracelet has some sag, to be expected of your birth year watch Price/Shipping: - I take bank wire, Zelle, and PayPal (add fee if you have good references and using G amp;S, still at my discretion) - Also will be glad to meet FTF within the SF Bay Area - I #8217;ll cover shipping CONUS, with signature!

    <TEXT>Hiya r/watchexchange, lets get this sold!!! Up for sale is a Rolex Date ref 1500 with a silver mosaic or shantung dial. Apparently there are silk threads woven into the dial. I #8217;ve taken some macro shots and will leave them to your judgement. These particular dials were released between 1968-1978, and only to the Asian markets. I acquired this particular watch from Crown  amp; Caliber last year. The serial is 2301xxx, placing the watch in the late 60s or early 70s. Runs strong and winds smoothly. Please look at images and videos for further details. Some specs on the watch, it houses a 1570 movement, which is a non-quickset movement, meaning to change the date, you would have to advance the hour hands until the date change happens. Case diameter is 34mm. Watch is a truly  #8220;all class, no sass #8221; kinda piece. **Images:** [https://imgur.com/a/owRY3bj](https://imgur.com/a/owRY3bj) **Timestamp:** [https://imgur.com/a/CVwPmFA](https://imgur.com/a/CVwPmFA) **Condition:** -Overall pretty good condition, scratches and 2 small dents on bracelet, crystal is free of chips/scratches -Date disc features period-correct open 6s and 9s -Comes with original folded links bracelet, decent amount of stretch, appropriate with age -Minute hand shows signs of oxidation/age -Was inspected/serviced by Crown  amp; Caliber **Price/shipping:** -Asking $2800 NET to me, I take Zelle, bank wire, and PayPal (please add fee for G amp;S and if you have good references) -Will be shipped CONUS USPS Priority, signature required, buyer pays shipping. -No box/papers, will come with C amp;C travel case Thanks for looking, feel free to send me any questions/inquiry.

    <TEXT>Hiya r/watchexchange, Recently acquired this watch in a trade with u/eudaimonean because I couldn #8217;t resist the colors. But once it goes on my wrist, my excitement fizzled, the colors clash with the colors of my tattoos and it became hard to look at. So now the watch is offered back to the community! I copied and pasted from the original owner #8217;s sale thread since he #8217;s more knowledgeable about this watch than I am. But pics are mine. Album: [https://imgur.com/a/UwRQkcI](https://imgur.com/a/UwRQkcI) Timestamp: [https://imgur.com/a/jUAS4iq](https://imgur.com/a/jUAS4iq)  #8220;Here's your second chance to pick up this hyped watch if you missed out on this 182-piece limited edition during the single day it stayed in stock at Hodinkee. Zodiac's GMT watches stand out with colorful designs but they are always extremely limited in production as it seems the company struggles to source enough movements to meet the market demand. **Key Specs**  #8226;  #8288;40 mm diameter, 13 mm thick. This model definitely hits the sweet spot of size, being large enough to be modern but wearable and an attractive fit for nearly all men and even many women.  #8226;  #8288;20mm lugs  #8226;  #8288;ETA 2893-2  #8226;  #8288;Ref ZO9402 Thorough information about this model is available at the Hodinkee website [here.](https://shop.hodinkee.com/blogs/journal/zodiac-super-sea-wolf-gmt?utm_source=referral amp;utm_medium=hodinkee amp;utm_campaign=hod-posts) **The Watch** This specific piece is 132/182 and in completely pristine/unworn condition. Stickers still attached and will ship with full kit, including proof of purchase dated Dec 17, 2019. Aside from unboxing it to inspect/photograph and giving it a small wind to verify that it works, this watch is completely fresh. The only damage I could find in the entire kit, is a small bit of wear to the spine of the booklet. Warranty: Hodinkee is an AD that will add 1 year to Zodiac's 2 year warranty so you're going get nearly 3 full years of warranty coverage on this. I need the funds so just trying to recover my cost here, which was retail price of $1695 + plus 9% sales tax where I am in CA. #8221; Price: **$1800** net to me. Shipping free in CONUS, or at buyer's cost internationally. Wire/Zelle/Paypal FF preferred, Paypal GS accepted at +3% for buyers with significant feedback or references, and at my disposal. Please feel free to make any inquiries. Follow me on Instagram @[bayareatimecollector](https://www.instagram.com/bayareatimecollector/) for more watches!!</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I know Perrelet probably has more haters than lovers out there. They #8217;re a microbrand that took after the name of Abraham-Louis Perrelet, aka the father of the automatic/self-winding movement. Even though the brand dated back to 1777, it only recently came out with some attention-grabbing pieces AFTER being acquired by the Festina Group in 2004. I recently acquired this in a trade, and haven #8217;t been able to find a lot of details in the watch. I #8217;ve read that it #8217;s part of 10, but each piece is different than the next, hence  #8220;Piece Unique #8221; and 1 of 1. I #8217;ve only seen another version of the Piece Unique, it #8217;s with a red dial listed on Sotheby #8217;s auction. Anyone with more info, please chime in! Hopefully this has been 500 characters.</TEXT>

There was one part about how he didn #8217;t know when he was dreaming or awake, but he could feel a rat chewing on his side, and the only thing he could do is wiggle his body in attempt to shoo the rat away, but to no avail.

    <TEXT>Happy President #8217;s Day r/watchexchange , lets get this sold!!! Up for sale is a Rolex Date ref 1500 with a silver mosaic or shantung dial. Apparently there are silk threads woven into the dial. I #8217;ve taken some macro shots and will leave them to your judgement. These particular dials were released between 1968-1978, and only to the Asian markets. I acquired this particular watch from Crown  amp; Caliber last year. The serial is 2301xxx, placing the watch in the late 60s or early 70s. Runs strong and winds smoothly. Please look at images and videos for further details. Some specs on the watch, it houses a 1570 movement, which is a non-quickset movement, meaning to change the date, you would have to advance the hour hands until the date change happens. Case diameter is 34mm. The watch is a truly  #8220;all class, no sass #8221; kinda piece. **Images:** [https://imgur.com/a/owRY3bj](https://imgur.com/a/owRY3bj) **Timestamp:** [https://imgur.com/a/CVwPmFA](https://imgur.com/a/CVwPmFA) **Condition:** -Overall pretty good condition, scratches and 2 small dents on bracelet, crystal is free of chips/scratches -Date disc features period-correct open 6s and 9s -Comes with original folded links bracelet, decent amount of stretch, appropriate with age -Minute hand shows signs of oxidation/age -Was inspected/serviced by Crown  amp; Caliber **Price/shipping:** -Asking a firm **$2700** to me, I take Zelle, bank wire, and PayPal (please add fee for G amp;S and if you have good references) -Will be shipped CONUS USPS Priority, signature required -No box/papers, will come with C amp;C travel case Thanks for looking, feel free to send me any questions/inquiry.

    <TEXT>Hiya r/watchexchange, happy Friday! Up for sale is VERY minimally polished polar 16570, I was told it HAS NOT received a polished EVER. But I take that with a grain of salt. However, you can actually see the factory chamfers still present. I think it #8217;s pretty rare to find a sports model with factory chamfers, let alone a particular favorite such as the Polar Explorer II. With that being said, plenty of scuffs and scratches throughout the watch. **Images:** [https://imgur.com/a/aIewZ7d](https://imgur.com/a/aIewZ7d) **Timestamp:** [https://imgur.com/a/vHAFis7](https://imgur.com/a/vHAFis7) **Condition:** -Overall pretty good condition, light scratches and scuffs throughout the case and bracelet, but crystal is perfect -Lume is still going strong, this Luminova stuff is cool! -Original 78790A bracelet with virtually no sag, Will come with 12 links -Runs strong and keeps accurate time. After a few months of wear, looks like it #8217;s running fast a few minutes. -Will come with Rolex box only, no papers **Price/shipping:** -Asking **$5900** net to me, I take Zelle, bank wire, and PayPal (please add fee for G amp;S and if you have good references) -Looking for a straight sale as I #8217;m expecting some life-changing events coming up -Will be shipped FedEx Express, signature required -I #8217;m in the SF Bay Area and always down to meet locally!

    <TEXT>eBay does too, I had sold a jubilee bracelet on there and it was an older model with end links designed for cases with lug holes. This guy puts it on a watch WITHOUT lug holes then wanted to return the bracelet. From his picture it seems he was tricked by another seller as the watch he sent was a later 6 digit reference fitted with a 5 digit bezel, so you can clearly see the case sticking out under the bezel. Long story short, eBay made me cover return shipping as he claimed the bracelet isn #8217;t genuine Rolex as advertised. And of course the endlinks were damaged during his process of taking them off his watch. AND he gets a full refund.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>This here is an Omega Speedmaster Automatic Marui Panda Ref 3510.21. Marui was the department store chain in Japan, which sold Omegas. Thus, there were a few editions released ONLY to the Japan markets. For pandas, the two most commonly known are the Speedy pro Misukoshi and these reduced Speedy Marui. The speedy pro Misukoshi was VERY limited, only 300 were ever made. In the case of the Marui, about 2000 were made. This particular Marui is complete with all accessories, and is in collector #8217;s condition. The dial is just starting to patina. It #8217;s becoming more of an eggshell white rather than a stark white as sub dial hands. I know a lot of people consider reduced speedys are not TRUE speedys as they are automatic and not manual wound. However, the stark contrast of the dial is just so eye-catching and the warm eggshell white is so calming.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Hiya r/watchexchange, happy Saturday! Up for sale is a VERY minty 16220 Rhodium Dial Datejust.

    <TEXT>Heya r/watchexchange, happy Saturday! Up for sale is a Rolex Date ref 1500 with a silver mosaic or shantung dial. Apparently there are silk threads woven into the dial. I #8217;ve taken some macro shots and will leave them to your judgement. These particular dials were released between 1968-1978, and only to the Asian markets. I acquired this particular watch from Crown  amp; Caliber last year. The serial is 2301xxx, placing the watch in the late 60s or early 70s. Runs strong and winds smoothly. Please look at images and videos for further details. Some specs on the watch, it houses a 1570 movement, which is a non-quickset movement, meaning to change the date, you would have to advance the hour hands until the date change happens. Case diameter is 34mm. The watch is a truly  #8220;all class, no sass #8221; kinda piece. **Images:** [https://imgur.com/a/owRY3bj](https://imgur.com/a/owRY3bj) **Timestamp:** [https://imgur.com/a/CVwPmFA](https://imgur.com/a/CVwPmFA) **Condition:** -Overall pretty good condition, scratches and 2 small dents on bracelet, crystal is free of chips/scratches -Date disc features period-correct open 6s and 9s -Comes with original folded links bracelet, decent amount of stretch, appropriate with age -Minute hand shows signs of oxidation/age -Was inspected/serviced by Crown  amp; Caliber **Price/shipping:** -Asking a firm **$2700** to me, I take Zelle, bank wire, and PayPal (please add fee for G amp;S and if you have good references) -Will be shipped CONUS USPS Priority, signature required -No box/papers, will come with C amp;C travel case Thanks for looking, feel free to send me any questions/inquiry.

    <TEXT>Hiya r/watchexchange, happy Saturday! Up for sale is a Rolex Datejust Champange Sunburst Diamond Dial Ref 16233. As you can see, the dial has NO lume, and the hands also match that configuration. Needless to say, the diamond dial is original from Rolex. The bracelet was recently overhauled by Rolliworks and it is TIGHT. I have taken a pic showing the watch can sit up on its own due to how tight the bracelet is. This is insane for a jubilee bracelet. **Images:** [https://imgur.com/a/Ovv00d9](https://imgur.com/a/Ovv00d9) **Timestamp:** [https://imgur.com/a/CZJEU9m](https://imgur.com/a/CZJEU9m) **Condition:** -Overall very good condition, light dings and scuffs throughout the case and bracelet, crystal is perfect -No box/papers, but will come with Rolex Service box -Original matching jubilee bracelet with NO sag, will come with 19 links. I will include receipt from Rolliworks for this service. Should fit a 7 #8221; wrist snuggly. -Runs strong, keeps accurate time, and winds smoothly. Rolliworks only recommended the bracelet overhaul as the watch itself does not need a service. **Price/shipping:** -Asking **$4800** net to me, *slightly* flexible on the price. I take Zelle, bank wire, and PayPal (please add fee for G amp;S only if you have good references, and purely at my disposal) -Looking for a straight sale as I #8217;m expecting some life-changing events coming up -Will be shipped USPS Priority, signature required -I #8217;m in the SF Bay Area and always down to meet locally!

    <TEXT>Heya r/watchexchange, hope everyone is staying safe and healthy during this pandemic. You have a long read ahead, you #8217;ve been warned.. First and foremost, the piece originated from u/the_great_patsby so I #8217;ll be paraphrasing his post, with his permission of course. I #8217;m hoping to find a horological enthusiast for this piece to give it a good home as this one is really something pretty special: a one of a kind Rattrapante from the company that invented the movement, Perrelet. You heard that right, this piece is No. 1 of 1 from a limited line of only 10 pieces, each of which are unique, hence the  #8220;Piece Unique #8221; model name. To those unfamiliar with the Rattrapante movement, it is a split-chronograph movement, and I #8217;ve included a video of how this work. Perrelet is a microbrand watchmaking company, tracing its roots to 1777, and named after Abraham-Louis Perrelet, considered to be the father of the automatic watch movement. As the nature of many unique and one-off pieces, there are rather limited information on the piece. I #8217;ve only seen a few other iterations of the Piece Unique. Below is a listing from Sotheby #8217;s auction, showing a red dial Piece Unique. [Sotheby #8217;s ](http://www.sothebys.com/es/auctions/ecatalogue/2016/important-watches-ge1604/lot.192.html) I want to make sure it goes to a good home, so I #8217;m going to list the trade value of this as **UP TO ~~$6000~~ $5000**. What I mean by this is I will entertain any and all trades up to the amount for trade so long as you can come up with something similarly unique and/or truly express why you #8217;re the right horological nut to give this piece the right home. State of Collection pics encouraged but not necessary (please feel free to post those right on the post so everyone can enjoy them, maybe drop a line of how you got into the hobby, I love hearing from the community), similarly, I encourage those new to the hobby to reach out and post as well, we all started there at some point. Unique, rare, and Out of the Ordinary pieces encouraged, but I #8217;ll entertain trades of more common pieces. The trade value is UP TO ~~$6k~~ $5k, but please don #8217;t send me trade offer for you Casio or Seiko. I #8217;d like to hover around the set trade value, give or take a few hundred dollars. For the right piece, I can also add cash on top from my end. The watch is keeping great time and the split chrono function is working in perfect order. I will also include a custom, handmade strap with the watch. The inlay is actual Kimono fabric from Kyoto, Japan. I #8217;ll include the strap maker #8217;s info below. I #8217;m located in the Bay Area, CA and is always down to meet local watch enthusiasts. However, let #8217;s practice safe social distancing and I can even bring some hand sanitizer if we decided to meet. Cheers! Some specs: -38mm dial -I think movement is a modified Valjoux 7750? -Will come with original strap as well as aftermarket strap seen in pics [Pics](https://imgur.com/a/HQNxVL4) [Split-chrono](https://imgur.com/a/geonfTN) [Do I need a timestamp?](https://imgur.com/a/VN9mqWR) [47Ronin watch strap](https://www.instagram.com/47ronin_watchstraps/?hl=en)</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Hiya r/watchexchange, happy Monday! Up for sale is a P serial Rolex Datejust Champange Sunburst Diamond Dial Ref 16233. As you can see, the dial has NO lume, and the hands also match that configuration. So really, if patina isn #8217;t your thing, here #8217;s a dial that has nothing TO patina. And I think the solid hands are pretty interesting. The bracelet was recently overhauled by Rolliworks and it is TIGHT. I have taken a pic showing the watch can sit up on its own due to how tight the bracelet is. This is insane for a jubilee bracelet. **Images:** [https://imgur.com/a/Ovv00d9](https://imgur.com/a/Ovv00d9) **Timestamp:** [https://imgur.com/a/CZJEU9m](https://imgur.com/a/CZJEU9m) **Condition:** -Overall very good condition, light dings and scuffs throughout the case and bracelet, crystal is perfect -No original box/papers, but will come with Rolex Service box -Original matching jubilee bracelet with NO sag, will come with 20 links. I will also include receipt from Rolliworks for this service. Should fit a 7 #8221; wrist snuggly. -Runs strong, keeps accurate time, and winds smoothly. Rolliworks only recommended the bracelet overhaul as the watch itself does not need a service. **Price/shipping:** -Asking **$4650** net to me, as always, I #8217;m *slightly* flexible on the price. I take Zelle, bank wire, and PayPal (add fee for G amp;S ONLY if you have good references, and purely at my disposal) -Looking for a straight sale but will entertain trade options Thanks for looking, feel free to send me any questions/inquiry.

    <TEXT>Heya r/watchexchange, hope everyone is staying safe and healthy during this pandemic. You have a long read ahead, you #8217;ve been warned.. First and foremost, the piece originated from u/the_great_patsby so I #8217;ll be paraphrasing his post, with his permission of course. I #8217;m hoping to find a horological enthusiast for this piece to give it a good home as this one is really something pretty special: a one of a kind Rattrapante from the company that invented the movement, Perrelet. You heard that right, this piece is No. 1 of 1 from a limited line of only 10 pieces, each of which are unique, hence the  #8220;Piece Unique #8221; model name. To those unfamiliar with the Rattrapante movement, it is a split-chronograph movement, and I #8217;ve included a video of how this work. Perrelet is a microbrand watchmaking company, tracing its roots to 1777, and named after Abraham-Louis Perrelet, considered to be the father of the automatic watch movement. As the nature of many unique and one-off pieces, there are rather limited information on the piece. I #8217;ve only seen a few other iterations of the Piece Unique. Below is a listing from Sotheby #8217;s auction, showing a red dial Piece Unique. [Sotheby #8217;s ](http://www.sothebys.com/es/auctions/ecatalogue/2016/important-watches-ge1604/lot.192.html) I want to make sure it goes to a good home, so I #8217;m going to list the trade value of this as **UP TO ~~$4000**. What I mean by this is I will entertain any and all trades up to the amount for trade so long as you can come up with something similarly unique and/or truly express why you #8217;re the right horological nut to give this piece the right home. State of Collection pics encouraged but not necessary (please feel free to post those right on the post so everyone can enjoy them, maybe drop a line of how you got into the hobby, I love hearing from the community), similarly, I encourage those new to the hobby to reach out and post as well, we all started there at some point. Unique, rare, and Out of the Ordinary pieces encouraged, but I #8217;ll entertain trades of more common pieces. The trade value is UP TO $4k, but please don #8217;t send me trade offer for you Casio or Seiko. I #8217;d like to hover around the set trade value, give or take a few hundred dollars. For the right piece, I can also add cash on top from my end. The watch is keeping great time and the split chrono function is working in perfect order. I will also include a custom, handmade strap with the watch. The inlay is actual Kimono fabric from Kyoto, Japan. I #8217;ll include the strap maker #8217;s info below. I #8217;m located in the Bay Area, CA and is always down to meet local watch enthusiasts. However, let #8217;s practice safe social distancing and I can even bring some hand sanitizer if we decided to meet. Cheers! Some specs: -38mm dial -I think movement is a modified Valjoux 7750? -Will come with original strap as well as aftermarket strap seen in pics [Pics](https://imgur.com/a/HQNxVL4) [Split-chrono](https://imgur.com/a/geonfTN) [Do I need a timestamp?](https://imgur.com/a/VN9mqWR) [47Ronin watch strap](https://www.instagram.com/47ronin_watchstraps/?hl=en) [My feedback ](https://www.reddit.com/r/WatchExchangeFeedback/search?q=subject1288 amp;sort=new amp;restrict_sr=on amp;t=all)</TEXT>

    <TEXT>It #8217;s a 24hr clock and the watch face is a 12 hr clock. 3 o clock could mean 3am or 3pm (1500).

    <TEXT>Hiya r/watchexchange, happy Sunday! Up for sale is a Zenith El Primero Rainbow in fantastic condition. It features a 39mm x 12mm case, perfect for those of us who have smaller wrists. The AR sapphire crystal disappears at times and really makes that dial POPS. Best of all, if you couldn #8217;t decide between a diver and a chronograph, this watch has BOTH! What #8217;s more awesome are the puffy hour indices have taken on a nice patina. It seems they #8217;re tritium while the hands are Luminova as they #8217;re still bright once charged. **Images:** [https://imgur.com/a/xutodfL](https://imgur.com/a/xutodfL) **Timestamp:** [https://imgur.com/a/tlk4huh](https://imgur.com/a/tlk4huh) **Condition:** -Overall excellent condition for its age, light scuffs on the case and bracelet, as well as the bezel. VERY minimal and microscopic scuffs on the crystal. -Comes FULL Kit, outer and inner wooden box, with hang tag, extra link (pictured), all booklets, and even the sales receipt! -Watch pillow #8217;s outer shell is flaking, as expected for watches of this era -Runs strong, keeps decent time, and date changes right around midnight. **Price/shipping:** -Asking **$3100** net to me, as always, I #8217;m *slightly* flexible on the price.

    <TEXT>Hiya r/watchexchange, happy Sunday! Up for sale is an Omega Seamaster Professional Co-Axial 300m aka the Casino Royale as it was worn by Bond in the movie. As for the reference number in the title, the watch was originally a ref 2920.80, meaning it came with a rubber strap from Omega. One previous owner sourced the correct steel bracelet for watch, so essentially it #8217;s a ref 2220.80. This, you #8217;ll see all the cards will have the ref 2920.80 on them. Yes, Omega has TWO separate ref numbers for the SAME watch just because the bracelet, very confusing. **Images:** [https://imgur.com/a/0fF76DZ](https://imgur.com/a/0fF76DZ) **Timestamp:** [https://imgur.com/a/a3MFug8](https://imgur.com/a/a3MFug8) **Condition:** -Overall excellent, EXCELLENT condition. Warranty card dated 2010. Only scuffs I could see are on the clasp as desk diving ventures. -Comes FULL Kit, outer and inner Omega box (outer shell flaking, typical for Omega red boxes), with hang tag, extra links, manual, and cards. -Runs strong, keeps amazing time, was supposedly serviced within the past couple years, but no paperwork for this. However, timegrapher shows great numbers! **Price/shipping:** -Asking **$2400** net to me, as always, I #8217;m *slightly* flexible on the price.

    <TEXT>Hiya r/watchexchange, happy Father #8217;s Day! Up for sale is a Cartier Ronde 1910, with an off-white dial and stainless steel bracelet with 18k accents, purchased in 2000. At a quick look, one can tell that it came from the Santos line, however with a circular dial instead. I #8217;ve recently received this in a trade, so I haven #8217;t worn the watch much to judge its accuracy, but it seemed to run strong and date snaps around midnight. Overall a very handsome and versatile watch, the case measures 33mm x 40mm and only 8mm thick! The bracelet comes with all links, currently has 4 links taken out and sized for about a 6.75 #8221; wrist. I like the bracelet a lot, but small wrists beware, it #8217;s designed so that if your wrist is too small, it will flare out around the lugs (similar with to the AP bracelets.) **Images:** [https://imgur.com/a/PvkFGF8](https://imgur.com/a/PvkFGF8) **Timestamp:** [https://imgur.com/a/NesQsqO](https://imgur.com/a/NesQsqO) **Condition:** -Overall excellent, EXCELLENT condition. I was taken back on how nice the finishing was, so included for your viewing pleasure are some pics through a loupe. -Few scuffs on the 18k gold bezel I took some pics of, overall minimal scuffs throughout. Crystal is perfect. -Comes with booklet and CoA from Ashford.com where it was purchased. **Price/shipping:** -Asking **$2000** net to me, as always, I #8217;m *slightly* flexible on the price. I take bank wire and PayPal (add fee for G amp;S ONLY if you have good references, and purely at my disposal) -Looking for a straight sale but will entertain trade options -Plenty of [positive feedback ](https://www.reddit.com/r/WatchExchangeFeedback/search?q=subject1288 amp;sort=new amp;restrict_sr=on amp;t=all) here Thanks for looking, feel free to send me any questions/inquiry.

    <TEXT>Hiya r/watchexchange, happy Father #8217;s Day! Up for sale is a Zenith El Primero Rainbow in fantastic condition. It features a 39mm x 12mm case, perfect for those of us who have smaller wrists. The AR sapphire crystal disappears at times and really makes that dial POPS. Best of all, if you couldn #8217;t decide between a diver and a chronograph, this watch has BOTH! What #8217;s more awesome are the puffy hour indices have taken on a nice patina. It seems they #8217;re tritium while the hands are Luminova as they #8217;re still bright once charged. **Images:** [https://imgur.com/a/xutodfL](https://imgur.com/a/xutodfL) **Timestamp:** [https://imgur.com/a/tlk4huh](https://imgur.com/a/tlk4huh) **Condition:** -Overall excellent condition for its age, light scuffs on the case and bracelet, as well as the bezel. VERY minimal and microscopic scuffs on the crystal. -Comes FULL Kit, outer and inner wooden box, with hang tag, extra link (pictured), all booklets, and even the sales receipt! -Watch pillow #8217;s outer shell is flaking, as expected for Zenith watches of this era -Runs strong, keeps decent time, and date changes right around midnight. **Price/shipping:** -Asking **$3000** net to me, as always, I #8217;m *slightly* flexible on the price. I take bank wire and PayPal (add fee for G amp;S ONLY if you have good references, and purely at my disposal) -Looking for a straight sale but will entertain trade options -Plenty of [positive feedback ](https://www.reddit.com/r/WatchExchangeFeedback/search?q=subject1288 amp;sort=new amp;restrict_sr=on amp;t=all) here Thanks for looking, feel free to send me any questions/inquiry.

    <TEXT>Hiya r/watchexchange, happy Monday! Up for sale is a full kit Rolex two tone submariner ref 16613. Though the  #8220;Bluesy #8221; variation is often more sought after, I feel the black-gold combination is less flashy and dare I say, more mature. This particular watch came with a Z-serial, with the sale date on the warranty of 2007. I was told the watch was serviced in 2016, but no receipts were included with the sale, so take that with a caveat. It runs and winds smoothly, date change snaps a few minutes before midnight. **Images:** [https://imgur.com/a/pi2EWbG](https://imgur.com/a/pi2EWbG) **Timestamp:** [https://imgur.com/a/b8Gj0HT](https://imgur.com/a/b8Gj0HT) **Condition:** -Overall excellent condition, as you might #8217;ve imagine, scuffs are more apparent and easier to acquire on gold, especially *polished* gold. You can expect to find light scuffs throughout the watch. This was not a safe queen. That being said, the lugs are extremely sharp, the watch has been very minimally polished, if ever! -In certain angles, a visible scratch can be seen on the bezel at 35 minute marker -As the title stated, it comes full kit, meaning: outer paper sleeve, outer cardboard box, Rolex display box, both hang tags, all booklets, warranty paper, all 13 links plus a 1/2 link, and even the dust cloth is there. **Price/shipping:** -Asking **$8000** to me, as always, I #8217;m *slightly* flexible on the price. As this is a high valued item, an overnight shipment is included in the sale price. I take bank wire and PayPal (add fee for G amp;S ONLY if you have good references, and purely at my disposal) -Looking for a straight sale but will entertain trade options -Plenty of [positive feedback ](https://www.reddit.com/r/WatchExchangeFeedback/search?q=subject1288 amp;sort=new amp;restrict_sr=on amp;t=all) here Thanks for looking, feel free to send me any questions/inquiry.

    <TEXT>So...I can #8217;t point out something that I thought was not normal? I know Rolex #8217;s cyclops mag can vary a little. This issue was widely reported on the DSSD of certain years. I was sure it also affected DJs. The point is, to me, the mag didn #8217;t look right. Perhaps if the watch was still under warranty (it #8217;s not), OP could get the issue fixed if he so chooses.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>You don #8217;t feel that the watch gives you a warm, fuzzy feeling like the pies mama used to make or the smell of burning wood in autumn? The sense of nostalgia that it brings forth? The watch has a sense of history, age, and of past experiences. Unlike its luminova/super luminova counterparts, whose dials stay pristine over time, these degrade over the decades, reminding us that nothing lasts forever. Those dials with stark white indices, to me and many others, seem bland and uncharacteristically lifeless.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Hiya r/watchexchange, happy Saturday! Up for sale is a personal favorite, a Rolex Datejust with a fantastic silver tapestry dial reference 16220. As the reference number suggests, the watch comes with a not-often-seen engine-turned bezel. The bezel is still sharp, as are the lugs, though the watch has been polished during services before. It is an A serial watch, placing it in 1999-2000 era, meaning the lume is Luminova, and as such, they still shine nice and bright once charged. The crystal is a service replacement, with a loupe you can see the LEC with an S in the center. That being said, it #8217;s perfect, no scratches or chips. The watch runs well, date snaps just a couple minutes before midnight. Overall an awesome piece. Of note, the jubilee bracelet is aftermarket. It #8217;ll come with 22 links and will fit a size 7.5 #8221; wrist comfortably. There is very minimal sag to the bracelet as pictured. The watch will come with box and booklets, no warranty paperwork. **Images:** [https://imgur.com/a/HFhsecD](https://imgur.com/a/HFhsecD) **Timestamp:** [https://imgur.com/a/ND3AP65](https://imgur.com/a/ND3AP65) **Price/shipping:** -Asking **$3450** net to me, and as always, I #8217;m *slightly* flexible on the price. I take bank wire and PayPal (add fee for G amp;S ONLY if you have good references, and purely at my disposal) -Looking for a straight sale but will entertain trade options -Plenty of [positive feedback ](https://www.reddit.com/r/WatchExchangeFeedback/search?q=subject1288 amp;sort=new amp;restrict_sr=on amp;t=all) here Thanks for looking, feel free to send me any questions/inquiry.

    <TEXT>Hiya r/watchexchange, happy Saturday! Up for sale a a behemoth IWC BIG Pilot Le Petit Prince Edition. Measuring 46mm x 16mm, it commands serious real estate on your wrist, and a hefty crown to work that giant movement. If the size of the dial doesn #8217;t grab your attention, the radiant Midnight Blue dial definitely will. The watch runs on IWC in-house movement, a caliber 51111 which boast a SEVEN-day power reserve. That #8217;s right, 168 HOURS of ticking away at 21,600 vph. And the power reserve indicator is right on the dial (since there #8217;s so much space), so no guessing of when you should start winding the watch. The watch itself is in great condition, with factory chamfers still present. There are minor desk diving scuffs that can be seen on the clasp, but the leather is pristine. The watch runs great, winds smooth, everything functions perfectly. This particular piece will come with IWC display box, warranty card (extended warranty til 2026!!), warranty booklet, strap booklet, original strap, and Tourneau sales receipt, dated May 2018. Of note, and this is super common on IWC leather straps, the original strap has ripped at the lug pins and is not wearable. The current strap is also an IWC leather strap with a deployant clasp. **Images:** [https://imgur.com/a/nzQCIYU](https://imgur.com/a/nzQCIYU) **Timestamp:** [https://imgur.com/a/jLqOgq6](https://imgur.com/a/jLqOgq6) **Price/shipping:** -Priced to sell at **$8250**, including overnight shipping, as always, I #8217;m *slightly* flexible on the price.

    <TEXT>Hiya r/watchexchange, happy Sunday! Up for sale a rare birdie, a pre-Tag, Heuer Regatta Yachttimer Ref 134.500 circa 1983. It wears at 40mm x 15.8mm and is in great condition. It boasts a Lemania 1345 fly-back automatic movement. Recently serviced in 2019 and seldom worn after, the watch runs great and the yacht timer functions flawlessly. On the dial there are 5 circles, as the wearer pushes the timer function, the second hand resets to the 12 marker and the circles changes to blue. Each circle will then change to orange as each minute passes, for the total of 5-minute timing. Then, as each minute passes, each circle will change back to silver, letting the wearer time events up to 10 minutes in 1-minute intervals. The original bracelet still tight, with 3 extra links, it should fit up to a 7.5 #8221; wrist. The watch will come with an extra mesh bracelet that #8217;ll also fit up to a 7.5 #8221; wrist if you #8217;d like to preserve the original beauty. There are some scuffs on the side of the crystal that is hard to see if you #8217;re looking at the dial, they #8217;re only really visible from the side.

    <TEXT>Oooh we #8217;re in very similar boats here, I too have a P6 W Germany police gun, design is very similar to its modern counter parts. My first 1911 was also a Kimber. My favorite 1911 right now IS a Springfield, for less than $800, the worksmanship is superb. Very tight tolerances between the moving parts!</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Hiya r/watch_swap, happy Sunday and welcome to the land of the free! Up for sale a a behemoth IWC BIG Pilot Le Petit Prince Edition. Measuring 46mm x 16mm, it commands serious real estate on your wrist, and a hefty crown to work that giant movement. If the size of the dial doesn #8217;t grab your attention, the radiant Midnight Blue dial definitely will. The watch runs on IWC in-house movement, a caliber 51111 which boast a SEVEN-day power reserve. That #8217;s right, 168 HOURS of ticking away at 21,600 vph. And the power reserve indicator is right on the dial (since there #8217;s so much space), so no guessing of when you should start winding the watch. The watch itself is in great condition, with factory chamfers still present. There are minor desk diving scuffs that can be seen on the clasp, but the leather is pristine. The watch runs great, winds smooth, everything functions perfectly. This particular piece will come with IWC display box, warranty card (extended warranty til 2026!!), warranty booklet, strap booklet, original strap, and Tourneau sales receipt, dated May 2018. Of note, and this is super common on IWC leather straps, the original strap has ripped at the lug pins and is not wearable. The current strap is also an IWC leather strap with a deployant clasp. **Images:** [https://imgur.com/a/nzQCIYU](https://imgur.com/a/nzQCIYU) **Timestamp:** [https://imgur.com/a/jLqOgq6](https://imgur.com/a/jLqOgq6) **Price/shipping:** -Priced to sell at **$8050**, including **overnight** shipping, as always, I #8217;m *slightly* flexible on the price. I take bank wire and PayPal (add fee for G amp;S ONLY if you have good references, and purely at my disposal) -Looking for a straight sale but will entertain trade options -I #8217;m located in the Bay Area and am always down to meet in person, and safety is the number one priority. -Plenty of [positive feedback ](https://www.reddit.com/r/WatchExchangeFeedback/search?q=subject1288 amp;sort=new amp;restrict_sr=on amp;t=all) on r/watchexchangefeedback here Thanks for looking, feel free to send me any questions/inquiry.

    <TEXT>Hiya r/watch_swap peeps, happy Sunday! Up for sale is a personal favorite, a Rolex Datejust with a fantastic silver tapestry dial reference 16220. As the reference number suggests, the watch comes with a not-often-seen engine-turned bezel. The bezel is still sharp, as are the lugs, though the watch has been polished during services before. It is an A serial watch, placing it in 1999-2000 era, meaning the lume is Luminova, and as such, they still shine nice and bright once charged. The crystal is a service replacement, with a loupe you can see the LEC with an S in the center. That being said, it #8217;s perfect, no scratches or chips. The watch runs well, date snaps just a couple minutes before midnight. Overall an awesome piece. Of note, the jubilee bracelet is aftermarket. It #8217;ll come with 22 links and will fit a size 7.5 #8221; wrist comfortably. There is very minimal sag to the bracelet as pictured. The watch will come with box and booklet manual, no warranty paperwork. **Images:** [https://imgur.com/a/HFhsecD](https://imgur.com/a/HFhsecD) **Timestamp:** [https://imgur.com/a/ND3AP65](https://imgur.com/a/ND3AP65) **Price/shipping:** -Asking **$3250** net to me, and as always, I #8217;m *slightly* flexible on the price.

The bracelet comes with all links and endlinks, however no spring bars. You should be buying this for a watch that should already have spring bars. The perfect upgrade if yours came with a leather or nato strap!

    <TEXT>Hiya r/watchexchange, happy Sunday! Up for sale is a much sought after Tudor Black Bay 58 20mm rivet bracelet, reference 72040 with the appropriate 698 endlinks. The bracelet comes with all links and endlinks, however no spring bars. You should be buying this for a watch that should already have spring bars. The perfect upgrade if yours came with a leather or nato strap! The bracelet has been worn and one can expect the normal scuffs from desk dive adventures, but no major dings or deep scratches. **Images:** [https://imgur.com/a/nM0ZbRI](https://imgur.com/a/nM0ZbRI) **Timestamp:** [https://imgur.com/a/a7kHwju](https://imgur.com/a/a7kHwju) **Price/shipping:** -Priced to sell at **$750**, as always, I #8217;m *slightly* flexible on the price.

    <TEXT>Correct, the dial denotes tritium lume, meaning it was, at most, a 5-digit reference, meaning at the very most, it #8217;s early 2000s. However, the case and rehaut points to a late 2000s period. Also case looks odd for a day-date</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Hiya r/watch_swap peeps, happy Sunday! Up for sale is a personal favorite, a Rolex Datejust with a fantastic silver tapestry dial reference 16220. As the reference number suggests, the watch comes with a not-often-seen engine-turned bezel. The bezel is still sharp, as are the lugs, though the watch has been polished during services before. It is an A serial watch, placing it in 1999-2000 era, meaning the lume is Luminova, and as such, they still shine nice and bright once charged. The crystal is a service replacement, with a loupe you can see the LEC with an S in the center. That being said, it #8217;s perfect, no scratches or chips. The watch runs well, date snaps just a couple minutes before midnight. Overall an awesome piece. Of note, the jubilee bracelet is aftermarket. It #8217;ll come with 22 links and will fit a size 7.5 #8221; wrist comfortably. There is very minimal sag to the bracelet as pictured. The watch will come with box and booklet manual, no warranty paperwork. **Images:** [https://imgur.com/a/HFhsecD](https://imgur.com/a/HFhsecD) **Timestamp:** [https://imgur.com/a/ND3AP65](https://imgur.com/a/ND3AP65) **Price/shipping:** -Asking **$3250** net to me, and as always, I #8217;m *slightly* flexible on the price.

    <TEXT>Hiya r/watch_swap, welcome to the  #8220;Big Watches, Small Wrist #8221; challenge. Are you man enough to pull off a Big Pilot?! I will be after wearing this for a while, my wrist will grow INTO the watch out of shame. Picture was blurry as I was struggling due to the weight of this giant. Help get it off of me!! Up for sale a a behemoth IWC BIG Pilot Le Petit Prince Edition. Measuring 46mm x 16mm, it commands serious real estate on your wrist, and a hefty crown to work that giant movement. If the size of the dial doesn #8217;t grab your attention, the radiant Midnight Blue dial definitely will. The watch runs on IWC in-house movement, a caliber 51111 which boast a SEVEN-day power reserve. That #8217;s right, 168 HOURS of ticking away at 21,600 vph. And the power reserve indicator is right on the dial (since there #8217;s so much space), so no guessing of when you should start winding the watch. The watch itself is in great condition, with factory chamfers still present. There are minor desk diving scuffs that can be seen on the clasp, but the leather is pristine. The watch runs great, winds smooth, everything functions perfectly. This particular piece will come with IWC display box, warranty card (extended warranty til 2026!!), warranty booklet, strap booklet, original strap, and Tourneau sales receipt, dated May 2018. Of note, and this is super common on IWC leather straps, the original strap has ripped at the lug pins and is not wearable. The current strap is also an IWC leather strap with a deployant clasp. **Images:** [https://imgur.com/a/nzQCIYU](https://imgur.com/a/nzQCIYU) **Timestamp:** [https://imgur.com/a/jLqOgq6](https://imgur.com/a/jLqOgq6) **Price/shipping:** -Priced to sell at **$8050**, including **overnight** shipping, as always, I #8217;m *slightly* flexible on the price.

    <TEXT>Hiya guise, buyer backed out, so back up for grabs!! Up for sale a rare birdie, a pre-Tag, Heuer Regatta Yachttimer Ref 134.500 circa 1983. It wears at 40mm x 15.8mm and is in great condition. It boasts a Lemania 1345 fly-back automatic movement. Recently serviced in 2019 and seldom worn after, the watch runs great and the yacht timer functions flawlessly. On the dial there are 5 circles, as the wearer pushes the timer function, the second hand resets to the 12 marker and the circles changes to blue. Each circle will then change to orange as each minute passes, for the total of 5-minute timing. Then, as each minute passes, each circle will change back to silver, letting the wearer time events up to 10 minutes in 1-minute intervals. The original bracelet still tight, with 3 extra links, it should fit up to a 7.5 #8221; wrist. The watch will come with an extra mesh bracelet that #8217;ll also fit up to a 7.5 #8221; wrist if you #8217;d like to preserve the original beauty. There are some scuffs on the side of the crystal that is hard to see if you #8217;re looking at the dial, they #8217;re only really visible from the side. Overall, the watch is in excellent condition. **Images:** [https://imgur.com/a/ZH0XdXf](https://imgur.com/a/ZH0XdXf) **Timestamp:** [https://imgur.com/a/z29wwEG](https://imgur.com/a/z29wwEG) **Price/shipping:** -Priced to sell at **$3750**, as always, I #8217;m *slightly* flexible on the price.

    <TEXT>Hiya r/watchexchange, happy Saturday! Up for sale is a not often seen but often talked about, a F-serial circa 2004 Rolex Datejust Turn-O-Graph aka the Thunderbird in a two tone configuration. It features a stunning red second hand and a red date wheel. And the red really pops against the champagne dial. As you may know, the bezel is bi-directional, able to rotate both in clockwise and counter-clockwise directions. Overall the watch is in excellent condition with minimal scuff and scratches. The bezel shows pretty extensive polishing and is pretty much the only flaw of the watch. Pricing reflects this flaw. The super jubilee bracelet is a dream, buttery smooth sliding onto the wrist and the clasp snaps shut decisively. There is minimal stretch with the bracelet and it #8217;ll come with all 23 links. The watch runs strong, winds smoothly, and date change snaps just a little past midnight. It #8217;ll come full kit, with hang tag, manuals, warranty paperwork, inner and outer Rolex boxes, as pictured. **Images:** [https://imgur.com/a/OLMIIEP](https://imgur.com/a/OLMIIEP) **Timestamp:** [https://imgur.com/a/rdiEdnf](https://imgur.com/a/rdiEdnf) **Price/shipping:** -Priced to sell at **$7700** including overnight shipping to you, as always, I #8217;m *slightly* flexible on the price. I take bank wire and PayPal (add fee for G amp;S ONLY if you have good references, and purely at my disposal) -Looking for a straight sale but will entertain trade options, as always -I #8217;m located in the Bay Area and am always down to meet in person, and safety is the number one priority. -Plenty of [positive feedback ](https://www.reddit.com/r/WatchExchangeFeedback/search?q=subject1288 amp;sort=new amp;restrict_sr=on amp;t=all) here Thanks for looking, feel free to send me any questions/inquiry.

    <TEXT>Hiya r/watchexchange, happy Saturday! Up for sale is a P serial circa 2001 Rolex GMT Master II Ref 16710LN. Of the three 16710 configurations, the LN is the most subtle, with its monochromatic black bezel. If you #8217;re into functionality over flash, this is the one for you. Overall the watch is in great condition with some scratches on the side of the case. The watch definitely has not been a safe queen and wears its battle scars proudly. However, the previous owner did have the watch polished during a recent service. The lugs are thick and even with chamfers still present. There is virtually no scratches/scuffs on the bracelet from the polish and the crown on the clasp remains tall. I am reluctant to list history of service as I do not have the receipt for such, but with the watch in its current condition, I #8217;m confident a service was performed recently. There is minimal stretch with the 78790A bracelet and it #8217;ll come with all 13 links. The watch runs strong, winds smoothly, and date change snaps just a little before midnight. It #8217;ll come full kit in Japanese, with hang tag, manuals, warranty paperwork, card holder with 2001-2002 calendar, inner, and outer Rolex boxes, as pictured. **Images:** [https://imgur.com/a/DM6SXwV](https://imgur.com/a/DM6SXwV) **Timestamp:** [https://imgur.com/a/gZTU0mh](https://imgur.com/a/gZTU0mh) **Price/shipping:** -Priced to sell at **$10350** including overnight shipping to you, as always, I #8217;m *slightly* flexible on the price.

    <TEXT>Hiya r/watchexchange, happy Sunday! Up for sale is a rather special member of Omega #8217;s Dark Side of The Moon family, the Pitch Black, ref 311.92.44.51.01.004. At first glance, the Pitch Black seems to be almost identical to the original BSOTM, with the exception of the white  #8216;Speedmaster #8217; text rather than red. However, upon closer inspection does one get to see the unique differences that make up the Pitch Black #8217;s characteristic. The first major big difference is perhaps the most noticeable, the strap. The Pitch Black comes with a leather strap, not the nylon strap with leather underside commonly seen in the others. Staying true to its namesake, the Pitch Black #8217;s hands and markers are varnished, adorning its matte black, ceramic dial. Then it turns around and shatters that as things go pitch black, the tachy meter as well as the Omega logo on the crown are filled with Super Luminova!! Overall the watch is in mint condition with virtually no scuffs or scratches as the ceramic case is very scratch-resistant. It #8217;ll come full kit, with hang tag, manual, cards, dust cloth, pouch, inner and outer Omega boxes, as pictured. The warranty card is blank but I did call the AD and confirmed the purchase was made in December 2017, meaning the watch has just a little over 3 months left on the warranty. **Images:** [https://imgur.com/a/vzLnVmG](https://imgur.com/a/vzLnVmG) **Timestamp:** [https://imgur.com/a/gfEUzx0](https://imgur.com/a/gfEUzx0) Check my feedback via the new system [here](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=WatchExBot amp;subject=Feedback+Check amp;message=Enter+username+below+that+you+want+to+check%3A%0A%0Au%2F6figureincomepovert) **Price/shipping:** -Priced to sell at **$6350** including overnight shipping to you, as always, I #8217;m *slightly* flexible on the price.

    <TEXT>Hiya r/watchexchange, happy Sunday! Up for sale is a much sought after Tudor Black Bay 58 20mm rivet bracelet, reference 72040 with the appropriate 698 endlinks. The bracelet comes with all 13 links and endlinks, however no spring bars. You #8217;re probably buying this for a watch that already has spring bars. This is the the perfect upgrade if yours came with a leather or nato strap! The bracelet has been worn and one can expect the normal scuffs from desk dive adventures and daily wear, however no major dings or deep scratches. At some point in its life, there was an attempt to polish the bracelet and as you can see, the finishing isn #8217;t as  #8216;dull #8217; as original. This is, of course, purely cosmetic and by no means affect the bracelet #8217;s reliability and functionality. **Images:** [https://imgur.com/a/XPIrZSm](https://imgur.com/a/XPIrZSm) **Timestamp:** [https://imgur.com/a/CjSk3el](https://imgur.com/a/CjSk3el) **Price/shipping:** -Priced to sell at **$700**, as always, I #8217;m *slightly* flexible on the price.

    <TEXT>Hiya r/watchexchange, happy Sunday! Up for sale is a ceramic Speedmaster Dark Side Of The Moon, ref 311.92.44.51.01.003. This is the original configuration of the ceramic DSOTM series with its red Speedmaster text, gloss black ceramic dial, and applied white gold indices. The 44.5mm case is a work of art and commands serious wrist real estate. The ceramic case can only truly be appreciated in person, photos do NOT do it justice. Overall the watch is in mint condition, visually free of scuffs and scratches as the ceramic case is very scratch-resistant. It #8217;ll come full kit, with manual, cards, dust cloth, pouch, inner piano black lacquer display case, and outer Omega cardboard box. The watch is currently on an Omega rubber strap with the original titanium deployant clasp. It will also come with another set of leather straps, most often seen on the .004 or the Pitch Black reference. These have white stitching on the top side and contrasting red stitching on the under side. **Images:** [https://imgur.com/a/EesBo2K](https://imgur.com/a/EesBo2K) **Timestamp:** [https://imgur.com/a/yb8KltH](https://imgur.com/a/yb8KltH) **Price/shipping:** -Priced to sell at **$6350** including overnight shipping to you, as always, I #8217;m *slightly* flexible on the price.

    <TEXT>Hiya r/watch_swap, happy Sunday! Up for sale is a ceramic Speedmaster Dark Side Of The Moon, ref 311.92.44.51.01.003. This is the original configuration of the ceramic DSOTM series with its red Speedmaster text, gloss black ceramic dial, and applied white gold indices. The 44.5mm case is a work of art and commands serious wrist real estate. The ceramic case can only truly be appreciated in person, photos do NOT do it justice. Overall the watch is in mint condition, visually free of scuffs and scratches as the ceramic case is very scratch-resistant. It #8217;ll come full kit, with manual, cards, dust cloth, pouch, inner piano black lacquer display case, and outer Omega cardboard box. The watch is currently on an Omega rubber strap with the original titanium deployant clasp. It will also come with another set of leather straps, most often seen on the .004 or the Pitch Black reference. These have white stitching on the top side and contrasting red stitching on the under side. **Images:** [https://imgur.com/a/EesBo2K](https://imgur.com/a/EesBo2K) **Timestamp:** [https://imgur.com/a/yb8KltH](https://imgur.com/a/yb8KltH) **Price/shipping:** -Priced to sell at **$6350** including overnight shipping to you, as always, I #8217;m *slightly* flexible on the price.

    <TEXT>Hiya r/watch_swap, happy Sunday! Up for sale is a much sought after Tudor Black Bay 58 20mm rivet bracelet, reference 72040 with the appropriate 698 endlinks. The bracelet comes with all 13 links and endlinks, however no spring bars. You #8217;re probably buying this for a watch that already has spring bars. This is the the perfect upgrade if yours came with a leather or nato strap! The bracelet has been worn and one can expect the normal scuffs from desk dive adventures and daily wear, however no major dings or deep scratches. At some point in its life, there was an attempt to polish the bracelet and as you can see, the finishing isn #8217;t as  #8216;dull #8217; as original. This is, of course, purely cosmetic and by no means affect the bracelet #8217;s reliability and functionality. **Images:** [https://imgur.com/a/XPIrZSm](https://imgur.com/a/XPIrZSm) **Timestamp:** [https://imgur.com/a/CjSk3el](https://imgur.com/a/CjSk3el) **Price/shipping:** -Priced to sell at **$700**, as always, I #8217;m *slightly* flexible on the price.

    <TEXT>Hiya r/watchexchange, happy Sunday! Up for sale is a much sought after Tudor Black Bay 58 20mm rivet bracelet, reference 72040 with the appropriate 698 endlinks. The bracelet comes with all 13 links and endlinks, however no spring bars. You #8217;re probably buying this for a watch that already has spring bars. This is the the perfect upgrade if yours came with a leather or nato strap! The bracelet has been worn and one can expect the normal scuffs from desk dive adventures and daily wear, however no major dings or deep scratches. At some point in its life, there was an attempt to polish the bracelet and as you can see, the finishing isn #8217;t as  #8216;dull #8217; as original. This is, of course, purely cosmetic and by no means affect the bracelet #8217;s reliability and functionality. **Images:** [https://imgur.com/a/XPIrZSm](https://imgur.com/a/XPIrZSm) **Timestamp:** [https://imgur.com/a/CjSk3el](https://imgur.com/a/CjSk3el) **Price/shipping:** -Priced to sell at **$700**, as always, I #8217;m *slightly* flexible on the price.

    <TEXT>Hiya r/watchexchange, happy Sunday! Up for sale is a not-often-seen TAG Heuer Autavia Ref CY2111 or as TAG calls it, the Autavia Calibre 11. This was the first generation of TAG #8217;s re-release of the Autavia lineup, starting in 2003. Though not officially the 1972 Viceroy Re-edition, to me it is visually the closest to the Viceroy, down to the case shape and the crown on the  #8220;right #8221; side. This particular watch received a fresh overhaul in 2019 and is running like a champ. Chronograph functions as it #8217;s supposed to and the rectangular pushers adds a contemporary feel to the overall vintage vibe of the watch. The orange accents on the sub dials, the chrono hand, and the hour markers make this watch a strap monster. Two NATO straps pictured along with the original  #8216;grains of rice #8217; bracelet will be included. The watch comes full kit, with booklets, manuals, display case, and cardboard box. Receipt for the service will also be included. Overall the watch is is great condition with no major blemishes. The polished chamfers on the case have gone more brushed-finished due to daily wear, but the sapphire crystal remains spotless. The case measures 42mm x 14mm and definitely has a strong wrist presence with the orange accents. **Images:** [https://imgur.com/a/hp6XG23](https://imgur.com/a/hp6XG23) **Timestamp:** [https://imgur.com/a/upmy4JP](https://imgur.com/a/upmy4JP) **Price/shipping:** -Priced to sell at **$2950**, as always, I #8217;m *slightly* flexible on the price.

    <TEXT>Hiya r/watchexchange, happy Monday! Up for sale is a Limited Edition Omega Panda Speedmaster  #8216;Pulsometer #8217; CK2998 Ref 311.32.40.30.02.001. The Pulsometric bezel is unique in that it was designed to help calculate cardiac heart rate. To use, the wearer would find a pulse, start the chrono hand, and count to 30 beats. Wherever the chrono hand stops at 30 beats, the bezel will tell you the beats per minute. For example, if at 30 heartbeats, the chrono hand is at the 20 minute marker, then the person has a heart rate of 90 beats per minute (bpm), at the 30 minute marker, 60 bpm, so on and so forth. This particular watch shows the purchase date of 2018 and will come with all accessories shown in the pictures. To the lucky buyer, I #8217;ll also include an Uncle Seiko flat link bracelet. Overall the watch is is great condition with no major blemishes. The brushed sides of the case are untouched, whereas the polished areas show some minor scuffs. Also there are marks on the underside of the lugs from strap changes. The 39.7mm case is very wearable and with the alpha hands, this re-edition is the perfect birth of vintage style with modern technology. **Images:** [https://imgur.com/a/prXhw0I](https://imgur.com/a/prXhw0I) **Timestamp:** [https://imgur.com/a/ELYgehb](https://imgur.com/a/ELYgehb) **Price/shipping:** -Priced to sell at **$5600**, as always, I #8217;m *slightly* flexible on the price.

    <TEXT>Hiya r/watchexchange, happy Monday! Up for sale is an all too popular Tudor Black Bay 58 ref 79030N. It really does not need an introduction. The watch was purchased in August 2019 and is still under warranty with Tudor. It shows signs of light wear with most scuffs only visualized at the right angles and under the right lighting condition. I tried to capture these imperfections as much as possible. Overall, the watch is in excellent condition. The watch will come full kit as shown in the pictures, including outer sleeve, outer and inner boxes, Tudor warranty card, hang tag, and booklet. It originally came on a strap, which I don #8217;t have, so included will be a B amp;R chevron NATO, and a black rubber strap. **Images:** [https://imgur.com/a/EI6BYcO](https://imgur.com/a/EI6BYcO) **Timestamp:** [https://imgur.com/a/8DPj9K2](https://imgur.com/a/8DPj9K2) **Price/shipping:** -Priced to sell at **$3200**, as always, I #8217;m *slightly* flexible on the price. I take Venmo, bank wire, and PayPal (add fee for G amp;S ONLY if you have good references, and purely at my disposal) -Looking for a straight sale but will entertain trade options -I #8217;m located in the Bay Area and am always down to meet in person, and safety is the number one priority. -New feedback system [here](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=WatchExBot amp;subject=Feedback_Check amp;message=u%2Fsubject1288) -Plenty of [positive feedback ](https://www.reddit.com/r/WatchExchangeFeedback/search?q=subject1288 amp;sort=new amp;restrict_sr=on amp;t=all) here Thanks for looking, feel free to send me any questions/inquiry.
