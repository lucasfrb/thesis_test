    <TITLE>So I am a little confused with new loot system.</TITLE>
    <DATE>2015-06-11 20:46:38</DATE>
    <TEXT>Currently I have played in a private server for two days. Day 1, right after update, everything was fine. Loots are everywhere and found a lot of guns/ammo around BMP/UAZ. Day 2, items on the ground were same as Day1, and nothing new respawn. Run from NWAF to novy sober, found nothing useful, everyroom seems empty, so can anyone tell me what is the proper way to find loot in 0.57?</TEXT>

I checked 6 cites in 2 different private servers right after server restart and they spawned NOTHING -- not even a boot. In the other hand, this made SVD and AUG totally unable to get for now. Didn't check the public server yet but my friend told me he found an M4 today in public server so I think they are ok.

I will be very appreciate if someone can figure out where the issue is.(a possible reason is my G-sync monitor, but nothing change when I turn off g-sync for Dayz) (just check the GPU usage, it never go higher than 40%....so basically Dayz does not use my graphic card, LOL)</TEXT>

Now T9 MBTs are totally dominated this game(ironically T9 AFV/TD/LT is underpower comparing to T9 MBTs) and lower tier MBT can do nothing to it. (So did it happen on C1 Ariete, they buffed C1 to make sure he can fight against other T8 MBTs, but this overbuff made him the most op T8 tank and those T7 tanks can do nothing about him now, lol)</TEXT>

    <TITLE>PSA: DayZ can not utilize overclocked CPU  amp; GPU</TITLE>
    <DATE>2016-01-09 23:18:47</DATE>
    <TEXT>I am using i7-5820k, 980Ti and ASUS mobo. I just ran a monitoring software and played Dayz for a while. The result data is clear: the frequency of my CPU will stop at 3.3GHz forever, which is the stock frequency, so as GPU, the core frequency will stay at stock frequency 1190MHz, ALTHOUGH I HAVE ALREADY SAT OVERCLOCK. Hardwares today are smart, they only overclock when under pressure, however, DayZ is very nice to our PC that it won't push your hardwares. For example, a non-overclocked i7-5820k will automatically boost to 3.6GHz if needed, which is called "smart boost", 980Ti can also do auto-overclock. And I also did a comparison with other games(GTA5, Fallout4, Armored Warfare, DOTA2, ARMA3) and some benchmark software, they did let my hardware overclocked.(5820k can OC to 4.5 w/o problem on my PC, 980Ti can go up to 1690MHZ as intend) ps: if someone can tell my how to make my pc work harder while playing DayZ I will be appreciate. (I didn't run DayZ at lowest setting, I sat to middle or high)</TEXT>

This price is much higher than US level, while the quality is as shit as the event itself.

    <TEXT>(PSA: I have played DayZ for 1000hours since its release, and I am also an active Aram3 player, so I definitely know how this game work) So, after a long-time afk I joined the 0.60 and played for a few days, but I have been killed many times with 1 or 2 shot while I was moving or hiding/prone in a deep forest. All of them are silenced, I have no idea where they are and they NEVER missed a shot. I am experienced about being sniped or ambushed, but this time things are quite different. I was either 1 shot killed, or got a precisely leg-breaking shot, even when I was moving irregularly to avoid the 2nd shot. So, here is my question, am I the only one that died like this for 5 times within a few hours? I am not complaining as I have died a lot of time before, but I don't want to get killed without a fight. edit: a reddit guy /u/ASnowStormInHell sent me a video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P9Bzb-G26XE hackers confirmed in 0.60</TEXT>

Exp for evolving should also scale with candy cost and rarity. Spending 400 candies to evlove a Magikarp and get 500xp, same as evolving a carterpie, sounds good? 3. Re-random skills after evolving? Then what's the point of evolving with the risk of changing skills? This is not funny at all. It looks like developers paid no attention to battle system. 4. Able to choose more pokemons at one time in "inventory". 5. Lucky egg and incense should stop timing when offline.</TEXT>

    <DATE>2016-07-20 07:11:37</DATE>
    <TEXT>http://pokemongo.gamepress.gg/pokemon/1 This site mentioned that "Note: All Pokemon freshly caught in the wild are ODD integer levels. ", this is not right. I just caught a Ponyta that had a level of 16 (my trainer lv is 23). It spent 1900 stardust to power up, and it was freshly caught, that meant this Ponyta was level 15 if that theory was right, but it had a CP of 659, which is higher than maximum cp of level 15 (649.81). I then powered it up, it took two time to reach level 17 (2200 cost), knowing that 1 Power Up = 0.5 level, it once again confirmed to be a level 16 wild Ponyta.</TEXT>

It's because of the GPS spoofers. You may want to ask: there are a lot of spoofers, why SF? Based on what I have found, there is a popular cracked version of PMGO, developed by some Chinese, and a lot of Chinese are using it. The Default location of that cracked version is Union Square in SF!

    <DATE>2017-03-08 14:30:06</DATE>
    <TEXT>The set can be obtained from new ancient dungeon located in metro center (100% drop chance, only 1 boss in the map). The new set has customized set effects, and each piece has their own random stats just like the magic sealed items. Based on some friends' info, the new 6 pieces set with "optimized effects" almost beat any 85 epic sets. Additionally, Raid reward also got a small tuned: 1) Anton exclusive no-savior epics can be purchased with 10 soul frags. 2) DI and condensed Antonium drop are slightly increased. 3) Anton raid reward will be nerfed in general because NP designers think it's too easy. And Some part of the rewards will be moved to luke raid (details unknow)</TEXT>

    <TITLE>Some of this event rewards just make no sense</TITLE>
    <DATE>2017-03-27 04:12:10</DATE>
    <TEXT>Just like the "2-5 purification stone or 22 kalido for 200 hours" that makes me feel like neople didn't know what they were doing when designing rewards for event. For this anniversary event, the only useful thing is the hell potion. As long as you buy 4/4 this event is pretty much done. Beating daijin is fine because some people still need leg box, but what the hell is that random legacy/halidom box? RANDOM? ARE YOU SERIOUS? A free 85 halidom set won't even surprise me and you successfully surprise me with random halidom box... Daijinrobot event is weird, there are not so many dungeons that take longer to loot materials than killing monsters. 3kingdom pet is cheap as hell and has a way better stat. And..oh..27 DI per day is a very reliable DI source, better than Arad balls! TLDR: Is this event really bad? Not really. But this is so bad considering it's for 2nd anniversary. Last year was really huge, but this one is not even close to it. We don't mean to ask neople to throw free high-end reward on our face but please make the reward make sense OK?</TEXT>

    <TITLE>KDNF designer apologized for imbalance between physical and magical characters.</TITLE>
    <DATE>2017-03-28 07:39:44</DATE>
    <TEXT>Korean designers apologized in the latest patch note: Designer were busy on adjusting Luke raid and this made difference between magical and physical characters out of control. And We apologize for this. However, adjusting a single class won't be the solution because this situation is caused by team buff and gears. We are also working on Summoner rework so it will take longer to come out a idea. TLDR: Magical characters are OP in luke raid, such as Battle mage, Dark templar, Asura, Necro, Soul blender. This is due to team buffs(only for magical attacks) stacking on each other. Another reason is characters with light/dark attribute can benefit heavily from Sader,Nen/SB.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>When I saw the graphic and renderer of PlayerUnknow I can make sure that it was built in Unreal Engine 4, and I am right. UE4 is probably the most recently praised game engine due to its comprehensive features and fast development. I am not meaning to put salt on DayZ community but what make DayZ development so slow is the bad engine (from Viktor's interview, I am shocked to hear that old dayz engine didn't even have the ability to interrupt an animation, this means that a mobile game engine is better than DayZ's) Back to the topic, I am more concerned how long it take to make DayZ "great" again, since the features they showed in the recent Status reports are actually pretty common in other engines and can not save DayZ alone. #BI PLS#</TEXT>

    <DATE>2017-04-28 04:55:23</DATE>
    <TEXT> gt; gt; gt; gt;XM1A3: Fire power: Ready rack is good and you can reload at 1/2 and only take 8 seconds. In this case, you can fire 3 shells in 10s by shot one gt; reload  gt; shoot 2. Defense: Garbage, the frontal armor is weak as hell, but side ERA is terribly strong. However, this will be nerfed in 0.20 and by then it will be a paper tank. The turret is very strong as long as you hide your turret ring, which is very large. Mobility: Turret rotation speed is so terrible that rotating your body is faster.  gt; gt; gt; gt;Leopard 2AX: Firepower: Current very bad, will be buffed to 900mm pen in 0.20. Defense: Nothing. Mobility: The only thing leopard has now.  gt; gt; gt; gt;Challenger2: Firepower: Super OP PISH round that can rekt Armata in seconds, will be nerfed in 0.20. Defense: Commander hatch can be penned for full damage. Very weak against HEAT/PISH. Driver hatch is no longer a weak spot unless you shot in 90 degrees and within a very close range. Mobility: Nothing outstanding here.  gt; gt; gt; gt;Armata: Firepower: +35% damage against heavy armor, which makes him very strong against other MBT. Pen will be buffed in 0.20 which makes him even powerful. Defense: The entire turret is nearly invulnerable and turret ring is very small. Upper frontal armor is only weak to PISH round. Hiding your lower frontal armor will make you very tough. Mobility: Outstanding.  gt; gt; gt; gt;T-15 HIFV: Firepower: Autocannon nerfed to the ground and it became a missile boat. Defense: Turret can be penned for full damage and frontal armor is noticeably weaker than before. Mobility: Nerfed to the ground and now it's as slow as MBTs.  gt; gt; gt; gt;Sphinx: Firepower: Another missile boat. However, he has the chance to spray autocannon to enemies asses with his mobility. Defense: No longer has a trolling frontal armor. Mobility: Still fast.  gt; gt; gt; gt;Cent155: Firepower: Much weaker than PZH2000. Will be buffed in 0.20. Defense: Occasionally bounce incoming fire with his upper frontal armor. Mobility: Fast enough to play close quarter arty.  gt; gt; gt; gt;PL01: Firepower: Very stable damage output with its accuracy, ROF and penetration. Defense: God-like in PVE, can't even get a scratch. The lower frontal armor is the only noticeable weakness. Nearly immune to autocannons. Mobility: The overdrive skill is deleted but it is still fast.</TEXT>

    <DATE>2017-05-17 10:51:44</DATE>
    <TEXT>1. It's true. Shadow, iceice and blinkblink got a lifetime ban from ACE (Association of China E-sports). Y and faith_bian somehow got rid of that and will join Ehome. 2. The start point of this whole thing is 5 players of Wings decide to leave Wings due to delay payment from Wings club. The club worked with ACE to unleash punishment onto 5 young bois. Y and bian "admit their mistake" to get unbanned. From blink and shadow's articles, 5 of them didn't stand together and some of them chose to be Judah. 3. The lifetime ban only cover events hold within China. Valve event is not affected of course. 4. Free Tibet is old, Free Wings is the new meme now. Something else: ACE had a long-time bad reputation for punishing their players with weird reasons (like, someone got fined due to wearing slipper), they also did shit on holding and organizing events. Even though they call themselves "Players Organization", they are more like a player owner or something... We both know ACE was funded by some rich ass Chinese young politicians and oligarch online company Tencent.</TEXT>

And ACE banned all of its teams to attending e-sports held by Alibaba. In this case, assuming Alibaba is holding an esport event, all major Chinese team of many games(dota2, LOL, csgo, etc..) would be absent. ACE was largely supported by Tencent (founded by Chinese 1st richest man) and Wan Da (owned by Chinese 2nd richest man and his son).. tldr: There is no players' right, no labor law, no bullshit.

    <TEXT>1. They are not removing lancer, instead, 2 more lancers will join the remove party. Dark lancer (lancer version of Soul blender) and Dragonian lancer(Asura). Dragon Knight (dragon transform) and Paladin (support class) will hit live at 7.21 in KDNF server. 2. Overall rework of world map to make you spend less time to level to cap. Some old NPCs will return. 3. New epic craft system lets you build a unique epic that fit your class. Material collecting process starts at level 55. (I think this is like World of warcraft's legendary weapon system, which you "raise" your own weapon). These epics look awesome and can change your skills' effect. Hope someone will post a translated version. 4. All classes will get their theme music and unique starter/awakening mission. 5. Phone app 6. Heroic akon dungeon. 7. Classes that have absolutely no support abilities will get buffed (i.e. Vanguard, Striker, Zerk??)</TEXT>

    <TITLE>[Spoiler]Things that are not very right in Defender</TITLE>
    <DATE>2017-08-21 09:24:50</DATE>
    <TEXT>1. That poor black guy was doing some real dirty job (like..melting bodies with some kind of acid) and Luke said he had a family to rise bla bla.. WutFace, Hand member has a family too. 2. Bokuto's dedication toward Collen. This is kinda weird. As far as I know, Bokuto is one of the long-lived leaders, and all he wanted is a human student. You just want to date her, didn't you? 3. Bear-killer Japanese dude. I can't even remember his name, due to his seriously underperforming in the entire series, comparing to how he was initially introduced. 4. The Hand no longer fight?? Comparing to that lethal, relentless, bloody Hand in Daredevil series, those in Defender looked like just some college students with suit and dagger, and 3 of them can't even fight a nurse. Where are those ninjas? Don't tell me they were all killed in the last episode of DD S2. What we got in Defender is that Hand is led by an illness woman, a funny looking African dude that got killed early, a Japanese dude that looks very imitating and constantly got knocked out, a handsome dude who can't forget his hot student and ..Gao, prob the only Hand leader that actually makes sense. 5. I am the immortal iron fist! The entire series went so good until Danny Rand screwed up, and in Defender, he is still that retard rich boy who can only fight like "Glowing Fist" for..like 1 min..The funniest part is that after he knew he is the "key" and he is still punching right in front of that "door". It was like smoking in a gas leaked house. The only thing that is getting better is his Chinese.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Been playing PUBG for a while, enjoying, good game with the competitive environment and some RNG, but I don't really think this can be an eSport game. ESport game is another level of gaming, need bunches of balance and polish, years-old MOBA games are still trying. And, not being an eSport game is not a shame. Those so-called "PUBG tournaments" are more like promoting and advertisement. TLDR: FFS devs, pls don't go the eSport way.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>So I spent some time undercover in a large Chinese hacker chatgroup. They have 10+ groups with a total of at least 10k people, they also use their account name to prompt their software. (If you saw a guy named like QQqun, QQ-12345, that's their chat software id). I am currently playing OC FPP and NA FPP and I meet at least 1 hacker in 3 rounds, especially in midnight when Chinese players are awake. Things are getting more terrible as your ranking goes higher. I also knew a guy who bought a 6000 RMB (900USD) hacker and could keep playing for 2 months not getting banned. I have a feeling that the speed of banning is slower than those who keep purchasing new copies. PLS do somthing Bluehole.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>1. Tencent bought 70B Korea Won of Bluehole or not? False. The deal has not done yet, but the talk is ongoing. 2. Tencent weibo (Chinese twitter) posted a post about Tencent will run PUBG server within China, but they deleted soon. (Please note that this is what Tencent usually do. 2 years ago Tencent released rumor about owning CSGO in China, but soon busted. Tencent is known for posting biased news and unconfirmed news, especially among gamers field, where 80% of them are barbarians lul) 3. The Chinese AD is about a Chinese network accelerator. Due to some network construction issues and large land area, Chinese gamer has fought against lag for a long time. Also, Chinese gov limited and censored international network usage so this is used to break the limitation if someone wants to play outside AS server. 4. This Chinese network accelerator, XunYou, works with Tencent. 5. Rumor says Tencent is helping PUBG build Chinese server. As you guys already know, Tencent is a network behemoth company, he can deal with a lot of things with money and power. (100% of Riot, 51% of Epic, 100% of Supercell, pls say Hi) 6. A very famous Chinese "LOL exclusive" streamer just signed a deal and became "PUBG exclusive" streamer. Personally, I don't think Tencent is not aware of this.</TEXT>

    <DATE>2017-11-03 07:07:46</DATE>
    <TEXT>The situation is here: this game is currently poisoned with hackers, and it's not entirely blueballs and BE's fault, it's the fate of a popular PC FPS game just like R6 Siege, CSGO and Arma. To those who think I am exaggerated, you may: 1) Died before a hacker gets to you. This happens when a hacker wants to lay low for the early game. 2) Usually play in low hacker population server. A good example will be EU FPP prime time, when most Chinese hackers are asleep. Speaking of hacker population, TPP solo mode is basically unplayable, try your best to avoid this mode. My roommate just tried in NA TPP solo when I am shitposting this, all of his 4 rounds had brutal hackers like 566453636 or WG-qun guys. 3) Hacker died before he gets to you. Note that not all hackers are brutal WG-QUN guys, many of them can be killed. 4) Wasn't aware of the mouse marco. This is prob the most prevalent hack type but you can easily tell it by their shot interval and their distance to you. If you have advantages and enough skill you can still kill them, but this doesn't make them not hackers. 5) Non-lethal hacker. i.e. a noob wall hacking guy who gets killed in a face-to-face gunfight. Anyway, I am looking forward to comments like "800 hours played, only 2 hackers blablabla". Also, my in-game-id is BoomBoomDollar, criticism is open for anyone who thinks I am noob because I am always whining about hackers.</TEXT>

    <DATE>2017-11-28 08:31:32</DATE>
    <TEXT>Here are some news about these things, for more details please wait for Tencent's announcement on Dec 1. 1. Chinese PUBG will run on Tencent's Wegame platform, the price is 98 RMB which is exactly the same as Steam Chinese region price. 2. Chinese mainland steam users who already have PUBG in their steam library can still play this game and will NOT be region locked. 3. Steam users log in via Chinese mainland IP can no longer see PUBG in the steam store page. This means they can no longer purchase this game with a CN IP. 4. Playing PUBG in Tencent's Wegame requires an age of 18+ and must be verified with personal ID. 5. One thing that I don't know: Does Chinese PUBG has their own server, or can still connect with other regions? We know that KR/JP users have their own game launchers(Kakao, DMM) but can still play with people from other regions. 5. Tencent already started developed PUBG mobile games long ago and release two copies as experiments some days ago. They are also the back-up plans If Bluehole refused to coop with Tencent. I tried one of these copy games, it has a lot of performance issues and often crashes just like its PC counterpart. It also feels very terrible to play such game on phone plat.</TEXT>

    <TITLE>Just saying, new map requires a different playstyle, many players didn't adapt, thus hate comes.</TITLE>
    <DATE>2017-12-23 16:46:37</DATE>
    <TEXT>Most players, including many of them in this sub, already adapted to a "prone inside bushes" or "capture amp;defend a house in the middle of the white circle" playstyle. However, none of them are available in new map: In Mirimar, playstyles are: 1) Loot: Players have to drop into large cities because of loots are not evenly spawning, or at least not as that spread as Erangel. As a result, players have to do hide and seek during the first two circles in large cities with a severe rubberbanding. (PS: I really don't mind drop into the fighter club in Pecado, but the rubberbanding made me unable to pick up a gun) 2) Travel: Due to the large size of the new map, players need to find vehicles to move, but the vehicle spawn locations are not as visible as the old map (there is no garage in the new map, or haven't found out one.) Consequently, dropping toward roads may end up with no vehicle and no gears. 3) Geometry. As I mentioned, vehicles are needed, but the geometry is very unfriendly to driving. Driving into some glitch location or flip while forced to drive on a mountain can really piss off some players. 4) Gunfight. Most buildings in Mirimar are horrible to defend because of the bad view, and there are not too much grass and trees in the wild, thus players are forced to shoot in the open, which is very hard for some casual players. Mirimar actually has a very complex geo and you can find some good covers too, but most players are already dead before they can be familiar with the map. What if Mirimar was released before Erangle? Will people piss off by Erangel because of too much grass? For those who are suffering the Mirimar, can we talk about Adaption?</TEXT>

    <TITLE>As a Chinese player, I don't think region lock will save the game from the current situation.</TITLE>
    <DATE>2018-01-07 09:57:03</DATE>
    <TEXT>As a legit Chinese player who also got completed ruined by hackers in recent days, I sometimes wanted region lock same as players in foreign regions, but honestly, I don't think that can work out. 1. There is still no detail on anything about region lock, we don't even know if it's gonna happen. It seems like PU himself doesn't want it, because region lock will enrage many Chinese players(include hackers). Yes, Tencent had done region lock before but doesn't mean it will do this time. CSGO and Dota2, which are run by Perfect World, don't even have region lock at all, so this is not required by Government. 2. Chinese people are good at bypassing Internet block. As /u/gomico mentioned in his recent post, VPN that used to play games is called game network accelerator and it's not treated as those to access banned media websites like FB, youtube, NYT. Game companies like NetEase and Tencent all have their game VPN, and a famous game VPN called QiYou is even sponsored by PUBG. Recently, China Government banned steam community, but most Chinese ppl just open their game VPN to access steam like nothing happened. So, if PUBG is region locked they could just bypass it with some click click. Remember that game VPNs are much cheaper than PUBG and hack software! 3. Code flaw. PUBG's code is too vulnerable to hack and re-write this can take much longer. I like how some users in this sub dreaming of Tencent's anti-cheat but I can tell you that Tencent's own games like Crossfire, DNF and NiZhan are still having a lot of hackers. 4. Famous PUBG streamers in China use hacker very obviously but only a very few of them get punished. Tencent is counting on them to promote the game and many of them are former League of Legend pro players (Royal Whitezz, PDD), which has a solid relationship with Tencent and a large number of fans. Hacking in PUBG is slowly becoming a cultural thing.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>1. Current state of PUBG China is in "pre-order" stage. Player can pre-order this game with his QQ account(a Tencent chat software). Additionally, one can link his PUBG China account(QQ account) with his steam account. (This sounds like how Dota2 is handled in China, one can register a standalone Chinese account and link this to an existing steam account to transfer items/data, or just play without linking) 2. Rumor says alpha server start on Jan 15. This is usually used for testing network stability. 3. Linking to steam account function will no longer be available after March 31. 4. (My speculation) It looks like PUBG China will work like how dota2 is running in China: For a standalone client user who plays this game with QQ account, he can only play within Chinese server. For steam users who linked their account, they can play in Chinese server using steam launch option like "-Tencent" or play in the global server as usual. Client in Internet cafes will also become "Tencent's version" by default. 5. There is still no news from Tencent about region lock. But Dota2 is no longer available for Chinese steam users, I am guessing region lock is coming. (Notice: Chinese steam users can still obtain Dota2 via VPN)</TEXT>

    <TEXT>As some of you guys already noticed, Dark Lancer and Dragonian Lancer got their CDNF exclusive skills that will not appear in any other region. Moreover, Neople designers responded the pray of CDNF Vanguard players and decided to give them exclusive buff! Here are the details that DFO Vanguard players will be dreaming all days: 1. All skills received 20-30% damage buff. (In the Origin update which will happen soon in DFO, Vanguard only receives a minor buff to some weak skills and 2a.) 2. Lv.45 skill Devastate will attack 9 times instead of 8. 3. Some weak skills that no one use, like Dread Bore, got an even higher buff. 4. Smash got a weird buff that can let Vanguard kill lv105 Ferman in 3s using X attack and Smash only (this looks more like a glitch relating to TP Basic Traning Upgraded + Mana Vertex Shoulder).</TEXT>

    <TEXT>While the Tencent PUBG has been postponed over and over again, there is some official news from Tencent. 1. CN PUBG will not share data with Steam: Clothes and match records cannot be transferred to Tencent's account. This indicated that Tencent will keep the isolationism policy like other games it runs. 2. Tencent advertised that they will use "super server" to provide a good game experience for players. Honestly, I have no idea what kind of technology Tencent will bring to us(more like an advertisement to encourage Chinese player playing in CN server).</TEXT>

    <TITLE>[Chinese PUBG drama]An infamous hacker streamer got un-banned. "He was banned by mistake" saying Bluehole.</TITLE>
    <DATE>2018-03-08 11:09:50</DATE>
    <TEXT>An infamous Chinese hacker streamer Muo-yin-nuo-mi, who was banned directly by PUBG Chinese division staff, was un-banned today. Previously, according to Bluehole's English reply to him, he cheated indeed. Meanwhile, Bluehole's Chinese statement said: "he was banned mistakenly". The funny part about this is: No one thinks he is innocent. One of the clips that led to his ban, where he shot 17 SKS rounds in 2 seconds and perfectly landed in one spot, quickly became a meme among Chinese PUBG community. This action once again raised the untrust against PUBG in CN community. 1. How is he unbanned while confirmed as balant hacker? 2. What if other banned streamers could get unbanned too? 3. If Bluehole can revise the ban, what about those who got falsely banned but never unbanned? The shitshow is getting shitty. Source in Chinese, from PUBG Chinese official weibo account: https://weibo.com/ttarticle/p/show?id=2309404215322226912012 In case someone ask, one of the videos he hack while streaming: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sDd7jSDd5lk Edit1: The main reason that Bluehole unbans him is that they think they misjudged. However, Muo-yin-nuo-mi (the hacker) posted a Bluoehole's reply in his personal account after he got banned, it said: "Bluehole double checked his account and decided that he was cheating". These conflicting moments make the entire story funny AF. Also, I apologized for the low-quality videos, this is the only one I can find on youtube and seem like has been uploaded and downloaded over and over. He is an indeed infamous balant hacker that why we shocked and scared so much: How could he get unbanned. Edit2: He is the first famous hack streamer that got banned. After this, another famous streamer 55kai (formerly LOL pro player known as Royal.Whitezz) and Mr.Snake (Another retired LOL pro player) got banned too. There was no doubt that these people were all hacking, thus CN players are fear of the hacker streamers' comeback. Edit3: Even in China, the largest playerbase of PUBG, people are starting to lose faith to PUBG too. Not all Chinese player hack and legit players hate hacker as much as EU/NA guys too. They were dreaming of Bluoehole, BE and Tencent eliminating hacker together. But now, while the hacker issue is still losing control, a banned streamer magically got unbanned. Online shooter games like R6, Fortnite are beginning to gain popularity in China as player escaped from PUBG due to hacker issue. PU and Bluehole, please take your ego away and act like a major company worth of 7b dollars FFS.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Not the Tencent PUBG server or region lock you guys expecting, but there is also some weird good news! Today, all net cafes in a Chinese city called Han Zhong had to uninstall PUBG due to local government's ban hammer. According to local gov's statement, PUBG is considered as illegal imported foreign video games that encourage young people doing violent actions in the game. Obviously, this is only a local regulation from a city in the middle of China, but you guys can understand why it is so hard for Tencent to get the license for running PUBG PC server from CN gov. (HanZhong is a city in ShaanXi Province, it's a rather small city with 3,700,000 population)</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Little did westerns know, but Chinese went into an "unofficial" trade war against South Korea last year because South Korea deployed THAAD to defend nukes from their north bros. Most Chinese people and governments thought that Kim's nuke was not threatening enough to SK, instead, they thought the reason that SK built up THAAD was to monitor Chinese military data. As a result, an unofficial trade war began, including force some Korean supermarkets to close, limit Korean imported products, TV shows, and outgoing travelers to SK. One of the Korean most famous export things is their video games. And, due to the limitation, Chinese gave 0 license to Korean game since March 2017. In March 2018, a Chinese high-rank guy Yang Jiechi promised that Chinese would remove the limitation on Korean stuffs, but it may take some times to work out. Source: http://cnnews.chosun.com/client/news/viw.asp?cate=C01 amp;mcate=M1002 amp;nNewsNumb=20180449567 amp;nidx=49568 The Chosun Ilbo is one of the major newspapers in SK.

    <DATE>2018-04-23 11:20:39</DATE>
    <TEXT>Tencent announced Fortnite CN website today along with its Chinese trailer. However, it has been 5 months since Tencent opened PUBG CN website, and it's still going nowhere. My speculation is that there will never be a PUBG CN standalone server, thus "region lock China" thing will never happen. Here is the reason: 1. PUBG runs on steam and Tencent still can't make its Wegame platform competitive to steam, thus Tencent doesn't think they can successfully grab players from steam. 2. Fortnite runs on its own launcher and Tencent is the major shareholder of EPIC game. 3. Chinese no longer gives new license to any Korean game because of THADD deployment in South Korea. The ban hasn't lift yet thus Tencent can't get a license for Korean-made PUBG to run in China. 4. Tencent finds out that Fortnite can make more money than PUBG. 5. Tencent earns enough by running 2 PUBG official mobile games.</TEXT>

Take FPP result as example, many team performed very differently in 2 days. OMG dominated in day1, but meh in day2. Liquid, on the other hand, almost pulled off. Some other magical things may also happen if there are another 2 days. (yeah, flipping car team-kill included). It's also worth mentioning that PUBG is still very random than other esport game: the circle position, the loot, the player position. It would be better if we have a longer schedule.

    <TEXT>My PUBG frequently crashes in almost every game for weeks after I installed my newly purchased ASUS mobo (ROG Z270) and I had no clue. I tried everything to fix it but it wouldn't work. Yesterday I came to notice that my AI Suite 3 (ASUS's CPU overclock software for ASUS Motherboard) put my CPU OC voltage to 1.5v. This is done by their "auto optimization" and I didn't notice this because I can't believe this software could allow such high voltage value. (CPU voltage is usually around 1.0v and can go up to 1.2v when overclocking, but 1.5 is nonsense.) I reset this value to default and my PUBG never crashed again. tldr; Check your damn AI Suite 3 if you using their 5-way optimization.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Q: Why did Tencent buy 10% of PUBG Corp. A: Tencent is just doing its job as a large Chinese investment company. You can also see Tencent's logo in a lot of Hollywood movies too. Q: Will the acquisition make PUBG better? A: Not likely. Tencent has invested a lot of companies (51% of Epic, 5% of Ubisoft, 100% of Supercell and Riot, and possibly a small part of Activision, Nintendo, Nexon, and Capcom). The point is that Tencent just did the investment for the profit and he usually didn't step into their game development. (Tencent had convinced Nexon to make an exclusive version of Dungeon Fighter Online for Chinese region, and this is more likely because this game is only popular in China now) Q: The investment has to change something right? A: Probably YES. After Tencent signed a deal with Activision, Call of Duty series was region locked and pulled off from Steam Chinese region. So Tencent can make Call of Duty Online (a special version that only runs in China, with creepy graphics and p2w features.) Since Tencent already signed the deal with PUBG Corp to run PUBG in China, it's just a normal action for Tencent to buy some stake from them. Q: What about the Chinese government? A: Chinese government can't touch oversea companies, which means you don't need to worry about losing your personal information by playing League of Legend. Q: How good is Tencent at developing games? A: Tencent barely made worldwide popular games, but their games did very well inside China, mostly because Tencent is single-hand controlling all the social software in China and has a large number of loyal customers that other foreign game developers could only dream of. Tencent had made a lot of p2w shitty copycat games but turned them into money printers. These kind of games are unlikely to survive outside China. Q: Can Tencent help PUBG Corp by sending out  #8220;good developers according to redditors #8221; A: As I said Tencent barely stepped into game development of the companies they purchased. I'd say, NO. Tencent will be more likely to hire good developers to help its local PUBG running. Q: Is Tencent good at Anti-Cheat? A: Technically yes but the cheating problem in PUBG is more because of bad and unprotected code. Tencent's own games have a looooooooot of cheater too and players are still criticising Tencent for adding the anti-cheat software "Ten-Protect" that significantly slow down the game performance and system stability. Q: How strong is Tencent connected to CN gov? A: Ironically, Tencent is just a puppet of CN gov. They grew large with the help of gov, and did the investment for the gov, which is totally fine. But Tencent can also be smashed by gov: Tencent made a deal with Capcom to run Monster Hunter: World in China on their own game platform WeGame, but it was taken down only 1 day after the launch due to censorship and reports from citizens (LMAO). Tencent also planned to run R6 but it was censored due to the word "Rainbow" is related to LGBT which is strictly banned in China (LMAO x2). As you can see right now, Tencent hasn't been able to get a license to run PUBG as a result of the ban on all Korean games due to Chinese and South Korean's conflict over THAAD. tldr. Tencent is just doing an investment like other big Chinese companies (Alibaba, Netease, Gov-owned Oil companies, etc). It won't influent PUBG that much as redditors' imagination.</TEXT>

    <TITLE>I haven't seen too many posts discussing two new guns (M762  amp; MK47). How do you guys feel about them?</TITLE>
    <DATE>2018-10-14 20:12:20</DATE>
    <TEXT>IMO M762 is kinda garbage because of the insane recoil. Although it has a crazy high DPM but having almost 2x recoil than AKM is not even funny. It's good for face-spray but hard to hit anything further than 50m. MK47 on the other hand feels pretty awesome, definitely better than his 5.56 counterpart (M16) when single tapping, but its 2-round burst is pretty garbage in close combat and totally useless in mid-ranged.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Pistols have been pretty much useless since PUBG started, time to fix it otherwise people would still skip pistols.  #8203; 1. Switching to pistols should be faster than switching to your 2nd weapon. 2. People should be allowed to using pistol while \[Driving\] \[Using Medical items\] \[Throwing Grenades\] 3. People should be able to open doors with F key in ADS mode if holding a pistol. 4. Some weak pistols should be already loaded when picked up. This encourages people to pick pistol when hot drop. (1911, p92, r1985) 5. Removes pistol quickdraw magazine. (Totally a pointless item and maybe reduce the server load by 1% LUL) 6. Add our boi Desert Eagle. Large caliber pistol is a life saver.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>The loot on Vikendi is bad, super bad, the lv3 helmet is the only exciting thing to be searched for because DMR/SR is almost non-existing. The point of removing lv3 helmet as world spawn in other maps is because dev wanted to see Blot action rifle take dominate. Devs wanted to reward those who prefer SR over DMR, as SR is harder to play with. Now since you rarely find Kar98/M24 on Vikendi you shouldn't be worried about lv3 helmet.</TEXT>

    <TITLE>Smurfer/Boosted Account is also ruining games in CN server.</TITLE>
    <DATE>2019-01-11 02:05:02</DATE>
    <TEXT>In case you are thinking that the reason Valve doesn't give a shit about booster account is because at least half of them are from China...Legit Chinese players, including pros are suffering from this for a long time. Currently, in very high mmr ranked games in CN region, if someone was confirmed as a boosted account, all of his teammates will go "Chappie" and let the game end asap. Due to "culture" reason, Chinese love ranked RD mode and this is a perfect place for booster (you are less likely to get countered if you pick meepo/brood/huskar -- the go-to heroes for booster, and you can't vote to ban). Also ranked role games in minority regions make things even easier. A week ago a dude with name "I bought this account, if you flame me I will feed mid" ruined a lot of games in top MMR games, and Chinese pros "had to be nice" to him to prevent him from feeding again.</TEXT>

Now finally I beat El Sueno and game will 100% crash when the credit list poops up so I will never be able to finish the main story.  #8203; Restarting after crash will put me in front of the mausoleum before the final cut scene so I will be never able to get out of the loop, any ideas???</TEXT>

    <TEXT>My friend introduced this game to me and I like it very much. Played a lot recently but every time someone shoots near me my game lose tons of frame rate. I did some research on the optimization like "disable full screen optimization" but it didn't help that much. My graphic setting: Texture: High. Visibility: 1000. Others: Low or off or at the very left side of the bar. AA: FXAA  #8203; Computer specs: i7-7820x 2080Ti 32GB RAM (3200MHZ) 144Hz dual monitor.  #8203; Just finished a run with my friend at interchange. I had 60-70fps at the start area and my friend had 70 fps with 1060. Something must be wrong. Please enlighten me.</TEXT>

    <TITLE>(Jan 26) My Personal Tier List</TITLE>
    <DATE>2019-01-27 03:43:30</DATE>
    <TEXT>Tier S (You should get them no matter what line-up you are using, they are just too useful): Shadow Fiend: Don't forget to sell him in the end game if you are not playing warlock/mage build. His ult gives free mana to enemy nuke hero, game losing useless ult. Templar: A geared TA can wipe out an entire mage line-up. Beast Master: His damage is just too strong in the early-mid game. Tide: Best CC, useful in most builds.  #8203;  #8203; Tier A (Core pieces you need in your strat): Razor: Core member of the mage and element build. 2x2 star Razor is better than 1 3star. Remember this. Crystal Maiden: Useless in early game but critical in late game due to her mage debuff and aura. You need 3 mages. All goblins: Goblin strat is the go of this patch. GUYro: 2nd Best mage. Enigma: Best front liner of element strat. Necro: You need him in hunter strat. Lich: Best mage, very powerful in the late game due to mage buff. Kunkka: 2nd best CC.  #8203;  #8203; Tier B (Very powerful and you should use them in your strat to get a top3 spot) Doom: Doom is everyone's dad. Troll: Best all-around physical damage dealer aka Nian monster slayer. PA: Le balanced crit lady. Slayer: OSFrog fishy fishy. QOP: good damage, garbage AI. DK: Only viable in dragon build but hell yeah. TB: Put all your gear on him to make sure he doesn't die. Jugger: Put one 2star jugger in your front line. Lycan: Early game winner.  #8203; Tier C (You are just here to fill the role): The pieces you need to complete your build, but soon be replaced. Druid: Win early, lose later, but still viable.  #8203; Tier F (I dont know what the fuck you are doing here) Tiny: Intentionally throwing. Drow: Seriously what the fuck. AXE: AXE..no more. Lina: Dumbest bitch. KOTL: Half life 3 will come out when he finishes his charge wave. Batride: You still need me to complete your troll strat, don't you? VINO: LOL  #8203;  #8203;  #8203;  #8203;</TEXT>

    <TEXT>"It was a fake code to troll the data-miner, randomInt(1/100m) lt;=1 is a dota2 workshop API that will never work because it can't return a value of 1"  #8203; Also, devs once denied the existence of Tiny, TB and Morph after some redditor data-mined them. But it turned out to be true, I guess devs have some ego that don't want to be "spoiled by data-miner"</TEXT>
