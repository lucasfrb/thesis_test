    <TEXT>I just faced a punisher emblem centurion. He was moonlighting as Shinobi and went on a losing streak to my highlander. He switched over to centurion and beat me, to which I switched over to Valk. Sad to say, he switched back to shinobi so..........I r1 spammed his shinobi to death.

    <TEXT>I play berzerker sometimes and face them sometimes as well. I face a good portion of shinobi and play as him, I also play as conqueror and face him sometimes, Valks are rare these days (compared to season 1) but I still see them, and sometimes I play as valk vs centurion. Pk, highlander and nobushi I play regurlarly and see them regularly so I wouldn't say rare. Lawbringer I face every now and then, same with raider and warlord. Kensei is a lot more popular as of late for some reason. I play as all of these characters, lb the least out of the group. Centurion, gladiator and warden are spot on. Orochi pops in and out from time to time. Centurion and Gladiator are the only characters I don't use. Nice thread.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Its hard, HARD, H.A.R.D., HARD AS HELL, but its possible, and it will take a while and a lot of effort. The main tools you have to use is feints, parries and gb. Your main strategy should be to feint and attempt to parry. As you said, good players will be expecting this and many will go for shove on block instead of parrying. If this happens, punish them with side dash, go for the overhead or side heavy and cancel into another side dash attack. Another trick that I've seen work a few times is heavy feinting into lights. Even though Kenseis lights are the easiest to parry, not everyone can do it, so its always worth a try to see if you can get away with this move. Just don't try to land the second light as I've seen most lbs parry it, what I do is try to land one light, then back up and see if they react. When facing lawbringers, your main source of punishment will be from a parry, oos knockdown or landing a gb, so its important that you bait for those parries and make sure you get them when the chance arises. Also, I'm sure you are aware of the changes in direction on kenseis side attacks, use them to confuse your opponent about which direction your attack is coming from. last, play some mind games. When you face a good opponent, they already have an idea of what you're going to do in their mind and how to defend against it. If you give them what they expect, and all of a sudden throw them a curve ball, you can catch them off guard. What I do, I'll start off by feinting every attack. When they get used to your tactics, they will stop reacting to your feints and just see what you do next. If you notice this happening, don't feint your next attack and let a straight light fly, or a heavy, just be ready to deal with the consequence if you get parried as its very risky but sometimes you will see them hit. to summarize, you must use every tool at your disposal to either confuse them, catch them off guard, trick them or whatever it takes to get your parries and gbs in for max damage. You are in for an uphill battle, but its possible to win, its just not easy.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I have to disagree a bit and I don't think he's necessarily hard to learn. Just like any character, if you're new with them it will take you a little while to get used to their movements and their recovery speed but when it comes to centurion, you have the advantage vs almost any other character due to his high stamina, ridiculous stamina drain, high damage, stun lock and has the easiest combos to land for the most guaranteed damage if they do. So you may find it easy to beat certain centurions, and I'm sure many of use here can as well, but the problem comes when you mess up for whatever reason, and all of your stamina is gone and you're damn near dead from one combo. No other character can do something like this consistently as easy as centurion can, so that is why people hate him. There has been various times where I was set to win but I run out of stamina or I miss a parry and I'm dead. That usually only happens vs centurions, and it makes me laugh when I lose as Kensei who's my best character and then I switch to light spamming valk and just light spam them to death and they don't have an answer, which leads me to believe its not the player, but the character thats strong. In conclusion, centurion is OP, were he not, the same players would beat my valk easy since all i literally do is light spam, dodge and zone attack. I beat a lot of centurions like this and it makes me laugh. My valk is less than rep 1 right now, level 16 or something, so you can put things into perspective. I'm not good with valk in any sense and have never utilized her full moveset.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I personally always liked skirmish and saw it as a type of training ground. The only thing i thought was off about it were all the power ups everywhere but it'd the game mode where you get the most chances to fight live opponents in any given match and there are no points to defend so it's just fighting. Also, the beginning of skirmish can have its own form of tension and I like to think of it as a gang brawl with two groups meeting up for a good old fashioned gang fight. If ubisoft ever made a realistic skirmish without hud and power ups I think more people would enjoy it.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>What? Have you tried a dashing kick? Kick cancel into grab? his hurricane cyclone zone attack? That irish clutch move and its soft feinted variations? His heavy alone has him running 3 yards to smack the opponent in the face. I would say only his lights and unblockable can be considered to have short range, so thats two attacks with T. rex arms, you must like to exaggerate. Shugoki level dodge is on the money though. Personally, I would like to see highlnander move like an NFL line backer, but that might make him O.P. Which makes me wonder, why the hell can raider carry people over his shoulder without getting tired?</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I think Kensei is definitely easier to play as but when it comes to having an overall, well rounded kit, Highlander has him beat. How it relates to the battlefield is a different story. Highlander does a lot more damage than Kensei, but due to highlanders slow speed Kensei's attacks are much more efficient. You have to feint just as much with highlander than Kensei to land attacks. I don't think he's particularly weak, just a hard character to grasp and be good with. In reference to 1v1, I find it a lot more difficult to use HL in 4v4.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>It seems to me they don't want to nerf centurion because he's their noob friendly character. I'm sure they're aware this game has such a wide learning curve so I think they put him in the game to give new players an "easy win".

    <TEXT>If you ask me, they need to nerf his damage and stamina drain. I don't have a problem beating centurioins, but when one manages to get a parry, or just tricks me somehow, its easy to gauge how unbalanced he is when he can almost kill you with 1 combo and take all your stamina. No other character can do that and its almost like an automatic win. Landing a Centurion combo is like landing that "special move", I forget what its called, in Mortal Kombat where you press the shoulder buttons and they do that cheesy x ray attack that takes half your life if you land it. I didn't like that feature in mortal kombat so I wouldn't like it here, and having a character thats the only one who can do something like that is even worse and shouldn't be in the game, but thats the ubisoft way apparently.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I'm honestly not interested in that absolver game at all, but it would be cool if they implemented someway to add different moves to each character, especially to certain characters which may be lacking a move or two, if you know what I'm talking about.....*cough*Kenseis opener*cough* but no, you don't have to know the opponents attacks for this to work, thats what makes it more interesting. Imagine facing a warden that has a hilt bash, spin attack and lunging overhead attack. How wouldn't it work? Of course they would need to implement a system within the game to make this all possible. Maybe I should specify they should do this in a future release, as I don't think they would add it to the current game, to be more specific.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>It really depends on the player and how well they can react to their opponents on the fly. I get what you're saying but I don't necessarily agree. I'm not sure if you played during the beta but at that time, nobody knew anyones move sets and many would agree, those were some of the best times this game has had.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>naa, define salt. Do I get a little annoyed? Yeah, but since I'm pretty good at this game I usually tend to win and even when I do lose, I know I'm not a pushover so for that person to beat me, they must be somewhat skilled, and I have to give them respect. Moreover, through this line of reasoning, everytime somebody beats me I say "good fight", simply because I know my skill and for them to have beaten me it must have been a good fight. Of course, thats not always the case. Sometimes I get killed while I'm idle, (packing a bowl or something) or I get cheesed to death, but ill still say good fight and get my revenge in the next rounds. There are other times when I lose every match until I bust out my main, so I'm talking about 6-8 consecutive losses until I bring the kensei out and get revenge on them. I have to respect the other player for beating me all those times andI get my retribution when the time comes. In the rare occasion that I lose with Kensei, I really have to give it up to them and I can't be salty for losing to a really good player, not to mention the experience I get for fighting them. Plus, I tend to appreciate the subtle nuances you pick up when you face someone better than you and the creativeness you must bring out in order to remain competetive. Last, I have faced opponents where we go back and forth and a lot of trash talking goes down (I guess you can call it that I'm on ps4 -- so a whole lot of "Thanks! Thanks!" or "Sorry! Sorry!" and even "group up!" but those are some of the most memorable and fun matches I've had, and most rivalries I get into end with a friend request from the other side. There's really no reason to get salty, unless you're a salty bitch that gets salty about everything. Also, I smoke marijuana so it helps to keep me calm about everything......if you haven't you should try it sometime. P.S. smelter demon wasn't too challenging for me, you should have referenced ornstein and smough or the lord gwyn boss fight. It took me a month or two until I just said fuck it, and grinded for a few hours trading things to that weird dinosaur who gives you souls to level up my great sword to where it does massive damage. Then I made lord gwyn my bitch and beat him in 1 or 2 tries, after the fact.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Ha! You can think what you want, honestly, i don't care nor does it bother me. I'd say I'm easily above average when it comes to various things, including video games. I went through Anor Londo and yeah, those archers were a bitch and very frustrating, but when I think of salt, I think of someone getting all pouty and throwing a temper tantrum. Sorry to disappoint you boss, but thats just not me. At worst, I may give a sigh of frustration, i might say "fuuuuuuck" or "noooooooo", but thats about it. I don't get pissed off and take it out on people or start yelling/smashing things/throwing controllers, games are supposed to be fun! Even when I lose I find myself smiling and sometimes I get bored from the game if I win too easy. Like I said, when people beat me, I always say good fight as a sign of respect for them beating me, even if I get ledged or cheesed to death. The thing is, cheesing or ledging typically won't work on me twice. You may get me the first time, (usually new players who catch me off guard) but good luck trying the same thing again. I will say, the disconnects are annoying, not infuriating, having shitty team mates sucks but if the other team is average, I'm sometimes a 1 man army, I don't see why you would get mad at having good team mates, I've fought cheesers before but I don't get mad and quit like a bitch, I rematch them until I beat them consistently (not just once then quit like a bitch) or one of us gets tired of playing (i recall my first encounter with a charge spamming raider, my first encounter with a spamming warlord before I learned how to parry, I fought both of these players over and over and over). To summarize, I don't get upset when playing this game. None of those things you mentioned make me feel angry or emotional in any way. Network issues have never been a big problem for me, if I experience a disconnect its maybe once or twice per session and thats it. As for unlock tech, I only recall one person throwing nobushi zone attacks from the side but I still beat him. Not sure if thats what unlock tech is but I can't say I face unlockers, that I'm aware of anyway. Even then, I wouldn't get mad, I would try to get even. P.s. now that I think of it, I think people getting salty arises from players trying too hard to protect their "stats" but I'm the type who doesn't care about stats much, what's more important to me is learning the skill, because stats won't help you win the fight. You could have the best stats in the game from quitting every match you lost but everytime you face someone better you will get wrecked and get salty. Ironically, my stats are pretty good but due to the many losses I've taken, definitely not the best. Nonetheless, like I said, its the skill that matters and I'm just waiting for ranked mode to gauge just how good I really am. So I'm definitely looking forward to that. As a side note, Ive been super depressed the last 7 months and this game has played a big part in helping me maintain by giving me a few hours a day where my problems don't seem to exist. It's kind of therapeutic in that sense, so its more of a stress reliever than anything for me, not a source of stress. I guess you can say I have real problems to deal with so a video game like this can't possibly affect me in a negative way. Again, sorry to disappoint.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>No, not yet. I've made the mistake of telling people to buy this game and I hope God will forgive me for my sins. It is a fun game, there is no doubt about that. There is no other game of its kind right now and once you play it, there is no going back. You are a part of our cult. Psyche. I'm just kidding.....or am I? Anyways, the game still has a lot of problems like balancing issues and disconnects. The fan base is good, the developers show a lot of support (towards certain things) but they ignore the overpowered characters because fuck everyone, thats why. Naa i'm just kidding, I don't really know why, but the balancing is all kinds of fucked up right now. If you waited this long, I'd wait until the holidays when its dirt cheap and hopefully they will have fixed a good portion of the balancing issues by then.</TEXT>

I play the game on a big ass t.v. and for some reason this game is 10x brighter than any other game. I have the settings tuned to where if I play another game with the same settings, i can't see anything because the screen is too dark but for some reason when I play for honor its as bright as daylight. The game being bright doesn't bother so much, well not as much as that damn flash. Please remove it, it adds little value in terms of Aesthetics and nothing else. The game will function just as good and the visible presentation will be better, not to mention it will add longevity to your game since people will stop playing it if they end up going blind.

    <TEXT>It only gets worse as you go along, it seems the better you get, the worse your opponents are in terms of cheating/exploiting, or just straight up cheesing the same overpowered or safe move and running away. Also, I'm on console. Now if you just want to play for fun, and you don't care about rank, reps or skill level, you can still play against noobs or other people around your skill level and still have fun. But if you want to be good, there is all that bullshit you have to deal with for the time being. Hopefully they fix some of it, but there is no indication they will going by their previous "fixes" which never address any of the real problems and make characters which need to be stronger, weaker. My suggestion is to put the game down for a month or two and come back to see if they fixed anything. The game has a ton of flaws now, but maybe in a year or so it will be playable. (kidding)</TEXT>

    <TEXT>In my opinion, when it comes to duels, ledging is ok as a last resort. I see duels as a test of skill, so throwing someone off a cliff immediately is a cheap move to a person who wants to test their skill against you and may have given you the benefit of the doubt. With that said, after getting ledged the first time, all bets are off and will ledge the opponent every chance I get. The same goes for attempted ledges, if they try but fail, they're going over. Besides, dueling on a bridge without having to worry about your opponent trying to ledge you is badass, moreso than just pressing a button to get a cheap win. A lot of people like to win cheap though, to each their own. As a side note, you make a lot of friends in duels when you play honorably. I'm not sure if it matters to anyone but I just wanted to point that out.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I have a few ideas but it all depends on others participation. First of all, we can have some place to discuss war strategy, like how to farm the most war assets, how to defeat certain characters, and we can also collaborate with other samurai groups on the discord to assess where we should place war assets. One of the things that I would really like is to have a place where we can post guides for playing with Samurai characters, and guides on how to counter characters from other factions. We can also have guides for noobs and possibly set up times where members of the group join up and work together (if they'd like to). It would be similiar to the other discords, just less anime themed, with a stronger emphasis on countering the other factions characters. Essentially, I want us Samurai to have a way to counter whatever the other factions throw at us, by any means necessary. The ultimate goal is to try and throw a wrench in this thing called faction war to stop the inbred tin cans.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Thats all right, I think there are different ways people can collaborate. If you know how to play in a way that benefits your team, you may not necessarily need to verbally communicate to be useful in a 4v4 mode. Aside from that, you don't need to speak the language if you can read the guides that are posted and improve your game overall. I think what will matter the most in keeping this thing alive is member participation, which seems to be the problem the current discords are having, so long as people are interested and want to contribute somehow, this may work.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Thats why I'm trying to get this group together. There are a few things I've noticed about asset production that I would like Samurai to know, but I would like to keep it from the other factions. I think if we put our minds together, we can come up with a good strategy to counter our enemies. P.s. I am also suspicious that the hobos and the inbreds were working together to oppress us in the 2nd to the last round to ensure we didn't stand a chance in the last round. The reason why I think this is because during the 2nd to the last round, I noticed the vikings didn't take any of the knights territories but they were attempting to take all of ours, while the knights were also primarily focused on our territories. From my perspective, it appeared that we were getting attacked from all fronts and our attempts were mainly to stay in the race for the last round. There isn't any actuall proof that I can provide, but we also can't rule it out as a possibility and we should create a strategy to counter this event in the future just in case.</TEXT>

Thankfully, we have at least a week and a half before the we get close to the final rounds, so that should buy us a few days to plan, coordinate and rally our soldiers.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>It happens but its not as common as it used to be and not common at all in duels. I should mention they're usually low rep accounts that feint, parry bait, cheese and just overall act like assholes until they know they're about to lose, and they tend to quit around the same time, right after they lose or when its apparent they cant beat you because you just destroyed their character (which is usually a centurion or a gladiator). You can't blame ubi for these players faggotry of the highest caliber (or maybe we can? Thanks ubisoft......just kidding) In any case, whoever is quitting matches to avoid taking a loss, stop being a bitch.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I have to say thats probably very subjective. When I'm playing well, I really feel like it makes a difference. For example, earlier today I started playing and the Samurai were doing well, but after a string of successful matches, we were doing better. We were doing so good, that I stopped playing for a while and when I came back, we were losing. I played this time until the very end, and we won. At the end of season 2, at the end of the last round, we were winning. I got on here and saw some people crying (knights) that we were going to win and how its rigged and blah blah blah, that I responded to him I said, fuck it i hope you guys win so you can stop crying about how rigged it is. I'd rather get a new samurai character over a a season win anyway" and I stopped playing. Then we lost to the vikings, but since we won the previous rounds we won the season. Last but not least, all the seasons that we lost, I recall getting my ass handed to me repeatedly, so It never felt to me like it was rigged, it really felt like we were getting our asses kicked and the times that we won, it really felt like we won. And for these reasons, I feel like my contributions make a real impact in the faction war. On the other hand, it really could just be rigged and the numbers are manipulated somehow, but you never know, it might not be rigged.</TEXT>

People should be a little more appreciative. Sure they've made mistakes, but who hasn't.

    <TEXT>I don't understand why people get mad at this game, sure it kind of sucks when you're first starting out and every hit you throw gets parried, every gb goes through and every ledge in the game you get thrown off of, not to mention spikes and and all the cheese, but after a while you just kind of get used to it and adapt. So long as you're improving somehow, maybe that is the difference? Do you play to win? Or do you play to have fun and improve your skills? Even when I get wrecked I still have fun because I rematch and try my best to adapt/learn something new. My guess is the cheesiest people are often times the saltiest.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Yes. Dark Souls is one of my favorite games of all time now and For Honor is up there with it. However, the combat is a lot deeper than the combat on Dark Souls so while you may not have to memorize 10 hit combos, their is a lot you will have to learn/memorize in order to be good. A lot of it is muscle memory though so if you can retain things quick you'll find yourself at home.</TEXT>

Years of waiting and tracking down every little piece of information and then finally playing the game and feeling dumbfounded. A little piece of me died with this game.....for months after the game was finished, like everyone here, I was desperate for answers. Now, 2 years later it still feels like I'm living with the pain of having lost something. There may have been some type of deep psychological effects embedded into our minds as a result of having experienced this "ruse" or whatever you may call it. I'm not sure how I feel about it. ....</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Damn.....this was really a fucked up game, whether it was intentional or not, its crazy that a form of media could have such deep psychological effects on the people who experienced it. Like i'm sure you have, and many others on here as well, I grew up playing Metal Gear Solid Games. The First time I played Metal Gear Solid was in 1998 when I was 10 years old, playing the demo over and over becoming intrigued with the story and the desire to find out what the hell happened to the Darpa Chief. Almost 20 years later, I can look back and see the type of influence this series has had on my mind growing up. It influenced a type of suspicion about the world, and the powers that be. A part of me believed that MGS V was going to expose some of the inner workings of the "puppet masters", so to speak, but what we got instead was the wool pullled over our head and we were essentially just used to further their agenda. There is so much going on in this series on so many levels and I sometimes wonder how much of it mirrors reality. It seems impossible for a weapon like metal gear to exist, however, there is a picture on the net of a giant german tank with nazi soldiers standing in front and my first thought when I saw it, made me think that it could have been the inspiration for the "Shagohod" from mgs 3. The concepts in this game aren't as crazy as they seem. But anyways, MGS V is possibly one of the greatest games I've ever played. It doesn't have the best story, but gameplay wise it is second to none. There was definitely a lot of things that could have made the game better though, and it had the potential to be the best game of all time. I still play it sometimes, but I have already moved on. Now I mostly play For Honor......that game is badass.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>You're right on, its easy to pull off but its easy to react to once your figure out how and if you can parry it, its game over for a lot of highlander players. But yeah, he's a high skill character, definitely not the one a new player can pick up and immediately be good with. It takes a good understanding of the games mechanics. When you understand the mechanics at the core, (guard timings, dash timing, roll time, hit time, etc) you can see the bigger picture and things just start making sense.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Highlander is not a heavy/assassin he is a heavy/vanguard. Giving him a deflect would contradict him being a heavy and would make him too strong. If the devs said it, then I don't know, but that definitely seems wrong to me. I've been playing a good amount of Highlander recently and he definitely feels like a mix between Shugoki and Kensei.</TEXT>

I read somewhere that the global adoption rate of crypto is only about 1-2%. With that in mind, its not a far off assumption to assume that only about 1-2% of people in the U.S. are involved with crypto.

    <TEXT>I'm new to crypto but from my understanding, the market behaves in cycles. We're about to exit the current cycle which has us in a downtrend. Like many have stated, many people have pulled their money out for christmas, aside from this, the weekends are slow trading days because most traders are out enjoyihng their weekend and their newfound gains. Couple this with the fact that its christmas eve and you can safely bet the markets will be down at this point. Wait until after Christmas when traders open their new positions and all the new money from "Christmas awareness" new investors starts rolling in. Then prepare to go long for the new year as many more new investors make resolutions to invest in crypto, then make sure you prepare for the next drop around march/early spring when traders pull money out of the market to pay for taxes. Remember, Cycles. Next November/December will see another huge rally like this years and the year before.</TEXT>

Ive seen it get a good amount of promotion in circles where people aren't really hip to crypto and they're given step by step instructions for how to buy with the simple promise that the price will go up due to the announcements and products coming forth. I'm a bigger picture guy myself, and I see TRX as having a lot of potential, both short term and long term. The high number of coins was concerning at first but its hard to argue with those numbers if you're making gains. A coin burn also helps to ease my mind a bit.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>As of right now, its mainly a store of value/speculative asset. In other words, its similiar to buying gold or silver as a way to store value outside of dollar bills/fiat currency and also similiar to stocks which you can speculate its value, basically place a bet on if you think its going up or down. What is special about cryptocurrencies though is the technology its built on, which is going to be very big in the next decade for web developers and many other aspects of the internet as they begin to "integrate" the internet more and more into society. Think "Internet of things" and micro transactions. Some people speculate there may one day be a whole new "decentralized" internet built enteirely on blockchain technology that cant be censored or controlled. Part of investing in crypto currencies is investing in that technology.</TEXT>

Christmas + Chinese New Year will always be a big dip for bitcoin as people take money out for gifts and traveling. Come february, things normalize, people go back to routines then come tax refund time, expect a nice rally before another dip as people take out profits in June/July for summer.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Thats good to know, I'll definately work that into my strategy. I generally track all of my trades, the amount purchased for what price and the cost in USD, then once sold the amount sold for what price and the cost in USD, with a side note for the total profit or loss from that trade. I'm low on cash right now so when I make profitable trades, I'll take 50% and send it to my bank account and reinvest the other 50%. To note, I only increase my position using profits from previous trades and its only increased if I can buy back in at a lower price. It has been working so far, but i'm always looking for improvements.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I'm still a noob to this but I think it makes sense. The rally up to 19k was too big and too many new investers fomo'd and bought in with the expectation that it would go up to 35-50k. Once it started crashing, many got out to protect their investment but the majority if new traders didn't know what they were doing and were left holding bags. I know a lot of people are expecting the market to turn around soon, but I'm sure its safe to assume that many new investers who were left with bags have itchy fingers just looking for a way out. Seeing how the dip has extended itself, I would assume more of the new investors are getting anxious to sell and many fall prey to weak hands.</TEXT>

I'm still new but I'm at least aware enough to see what is happening and have enough foresight to see certain moves before they happen. I'm not 100%, but its literally not rocket science. -edit bitcoin went down to 8k, its working. I don't know about you but I was waiting for this and I bought several times today.</TEXT>

Its not so bad, I bought in around 96500 2 or 3 times right before i watched it dip into the 8/s.......whatever, no big deal right its still only up about 1000% from last year?</TEXT>

    <TEXT>It really comes down to perspective. Think about it like this. If you sell today, you can have some money for food, but it will be much less that what you originally had. But lets say you wait a whole month and it goes up to 17k, if you sell then, you don't lose so much. Now lets say you weren't playing with lunch/rent money and it didn't matter how long you had to wait, if you don't need to sell, you lose nothing. Were this some other asset you'd have a point but its almost guaranteed that bitcoin hits 20k by the end of the year. If you truly understand the technology, this dip is a good time to buy. It might go lower than this, but thats why you don't play with lunch or rent money.</TEXT>

I could not possibly explain it to you on a reddit post even if I tried. My advice is to study market cycles in correlation with other cycles and how certain things affect the markets, dow theory, trading concepts, identifying patterns, etc. there is a lot to learn.....even if you're not interested in day trading, those are the tools that help you to see what is going on.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>The same for me, the controls from mgsv are so smooth they should just make them the industry standard for third person shooting games. I'm also not mad that they chose the spin off route, I don't think anyone really wants Konami to mess with the metal gear storyline unless Kojima is present. Alot of these new mechanics would be great in future metal gear titles. Some of these should have been in the phantom pain though. I expected mother base and FOBs to be much more functional and customizable. I was also hoping for some MGS3 type survival/hunting mechanics so its nice to see them make a comeback. I'm hoping the story doesn't suck balls or crap out halfway into it, part of me expects this game to be cheesy and half assed but the gameplay and concepts of metal gear mixed with inter-dimensional travel is very intriguing. Overall, it has a ton of potential.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>It should've been, but its obviously more than that. if you played the beta, you can see its deeper than most would've anticipated. It also shows an influence Kojima mentioned in an interview leading up to phantom pain, which is dark souls. There's definitely some influence in Survive with some of the stats you level up being similiar to dark souls. I'm on the fence if I should buy this when it comes out, but ill likely end up buying it a week or two later from somebody second hand, just in case.....</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I know what you mean, i'm annoyed by all of the people hating on this game without even trying it. All i know is that this game has mechanics which I had been hoping for in MGS V and playing this game is like a dream that I expect to wake up from and realizing it sucks (short story, no replay value, no deep connections, nothing to think about, etc.) but maybe thats not the case. I will wait until more people finish the game. I really did enjoy what I played and I would like to play more, I just don't want to buy it and be disappointed that there's only 2-3 short/small maps/levels. This game is based on Dante's Inferno, given that there's 7-9 circles of hell, I can only be satisfied if this game has at least 7 different areas to explore. If thats the case, I might buy it immediately but if theres 2-3 levels, i'll just wait until its 20$. Last, to answer your question, I'm not a social media guy so i'm not on twitter or any of those sites, i'm hoping the creators are secretly spying on this sub.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Interesting post. I didn't read the spoiler part but the rest sounds plausible. Also, I agree with your last point especially the part about kojima getting the B team to finish up Survive while he works on Death Stranding. I've been thinking that some of the mechanics in survive may have been planned for MGSV, but due to time restrictions and a lack of funds, they split the game into several parts after which Kojima became inspired to create something truly grand, possibly greater than any MG we've ever seen. Thus, the ruse is a way to buy time and generate funds. I think Kojima foresaw the hate that was about to rise up from MGSV being incomplete and including microtransactions (which were probably necessary to fund his grand vision if Konami felt his productions were money sinks) so he "split from Konami" and made them the "bad guy." Konami gets all the hate for splitting up MGSV into several parts and including microtransactions, meanwhile Kojima goes off on his own to create DS (whatever thats going to be --possibly MGS with survive mechanics mixed with Silent hills type horror?) The only casualty in this is MG Survive, but they probably knew die hard fans would buy it anyway, new fans/casuals will probably pick it up and over time, more fans might come around when they play it and see how cool it is. Of course, this is all speculation and I could be completely wrong, but it seems likely to me and I have a good eye for seeing the bigger picture and putting connections together (Not the best though, some of the people here post like Metal Gear scientists)</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I personally don't believe that he was forced to do Metal Gear Solid. You don't spend that much time and dedication, or have that much passion for something you don't want to do. Kojima loves Metal Gear Solid and it shows, despite what he may have said in the past. Remember that everytime he said he was going to quit Metal Gear Solid was just to create hype when the next title is announced after everyone thought Metal Gear was over.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>1. Mainly to stroke Kojima's ego - if you hadn't followed Kojima since Metal Gear Solid, he likes to trick people and create massive amounts of hype for his games, so if there is a ruse, I would say it's a massive publicity stunt. It also coincides with various recurring themes in the series such as government agencies/institutions deception against citizens/the world, alternate/secret history, secret societies, etc. These themes were purposely chosen to teach the player critical thinking skills and questioning so called "facts". So given that the majority of people here are long time players of Metal Gear Solid, I think many are just trained to look for these inconsistencies and this sub is the fruit of our labor. 2. To make a lot of money. This one's self explanatory. 3. Despite what Kojima has said in the past and what most people think, it seems to me Kojima LOVES Metal Gear Solid. The evidence in him making what appears to be a spiritual successor/prequel/time travel (who really knows at this point) to Metal Gear when he could be making whatever he wants and should be expectedly making something totally different if he is as tired of making Metal Gear Solid as people claim him to be. It's hard to say what's really going on, but one thing is likely and that's Kojima is looking to trick people again, and he said these infamous words himself, "Betray your audience."</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I honestly don't think this is purely a bait and switch, you need to think deeper about the concepts in the series and the parallels they have to society. In Metal Gear Solid, the underlying theme was a secret society of wealthy weapons manufacturers who quietly pulled the strings of American Politics. Metal Gear Solid 2 built upon this premise, mentioning the "Patriots/La-Li-Lu-Le-Lo" and went even deeper, mentioning the type of brainwashing effect video games have on the player amongst various other parallels. Metal Gear Solid 3 showed us a portion of the beginning when the conspiracies that played out in MGS and MGS2 began taking form. The underlying concepts that Kojima includes in his games and the way he does it is what makes him a genius to us, its what makes his games Art. They force you to think critically about the world around you and question what you know. I get that you don't like to learn things, but with a series as deep as Metal Gear, critical thinking is crucial. It's not about "bait and switch", that's child's play. Look deeper.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Ok, maybe not exactly but it appears to have similiar themes as all of the Metal Gear games, our logic is not the same. You look at the external, i'm looking at the underlying themes: government conspiracies/secrets, "black operations", military/tactical action, suppressed technology, wormholes (MGSV), cloned babies. My point is, all of the people who claim Kojima doesn't want to make Metal Gear Solid but the evidence so far looks to be a Metal Gear game to those of us who've been paying attention since Metal Gear Solid. Death Stranding is also likely to be a third person military-stealth-tactical shooter.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I don't think you truly understand the implications of their being a ruse and the parallels it has to the video game and the player's experience. Put it in the perspective of the player, opening up and playing MGSV for the first time. He's expecting to play the storyline of Big Boss, but the player doesn't realize the whole story is a ruse until the end of the game and you realize you've been played. If the ruse is true, like some of us think, what's happened to the player in MGSV is happenenig again but in real time. Just for kicks, let's imagine DS comes out with no mention or reveal of a ruse, the player sits down to play and at the end of DS learns the whole situation was a ruse and DS is related to Metal Gear. How fucking genius is that? Players minds will blow up.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>There will be notoriety because once again, Kojima told people he was going to stop making metal gear and once again, millions of people believed him. Surely, there will be plenty of fans who will get butthurt, similiar to how butthurt fans were to find out they were playing as Raiden in MGS2, but overall will only serve to increase Kojima's legend and so called "genius". If death stranding turns out to be Metal Gear and Silent Hills, there won't be denying the man as a genius.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>As previously stated, Kojima has enough hard core fans world wide that any game he makes will see a good amount of sales. Kojima also makes highly polished games which are likely to receive really high scores and win multiple awards. Kojima's goal with these "ruses" or tricks that he does with his games isn't meant for mainstream audiences, it's for his core fans to enjoy and decipher. When TPP was exposed as MGSV, it wasn't the noobs/cuasuals who figured it out, but hardened Metal Gear veterans who saw the connections and figured it out.</TEXT>

Whatever your favorite game is, there are plenty of people who feel the exact same way as what you just described. In the grand scheme of things, if this does end up happening, two things are certain. 1. Metal Gear fans will love it and will talk about it for years to come (it's been almost 2 1/2 years since TPP and look how people are still talking) and 2. The gaming media will gush over it and will talk about it for years to come.

There is not a single Kojima made Metal Gear Solid game which has not been praised to high heaven and mentioned as the standard for years to come. Metal Gear Solid was groundbreaking in the ps1 era as was Metal Gear Solid 2 in the ps2 era. Metal Gear Solid 3 was praised as a great game and Metal Gear Solid 4 was praised as a Masterpiece by ps3 gaming media and was talked about for years afterwards. Metal Gear Solid V came out 2 years ago and is still being hotly debated today, due to the ruse were talking about. Your logic has serious flaws. Every Metal Gear game Kojima makes gets talked about for years after release.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I think you have a point. Kojima productions is still owned by Konami. Apparently, anytime a publicly listed company has to make changes to their executives group or change in departments, they're legally required to notify share holders. Kojima was delisted as an executive, but as far as i know, there wasn't any official statement declaring his departure. The only statements from konami employees i have seen are ambiguous ways to say he still works there. They said Konami was being "restructured" and Kojima will continue working on Metal gear Solid...." The restructuring was kojima no longer serving as V.P. of Konami Digital Entertainment (which is a subsidiary of Konami), and moving on to some other capacity, amongst other things, most likely. His departure being only temporary. Considering that may be true, there not being an official statement that Kojima was fired speaks volumes. The reasons people ASSUME he was, is from "rumors" that were spread through social media and online news articles that eerily mirror core concepts of the series. "Remember, their purpose is to not to CONTROL FACTS (doing so can be potentially illegal), but to CREATE CONTEXT. The CONTEXT, stated that Kojima was fired, and people ran with it.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Ok let me try to reiterate what you're saying to see if I understand. The public statements they made were valid at the time, but Konami's silence after Kojima claims his contract has expired is telling, otherwise a statement claiming otherwise could be illegal.....though I want to ask, is not providing a statement about his departure illegal at this point? Would that not be lying by omission? I think Kojima was demoted from executive at the time of his departure, is this the reason why they haven't gave a statement to investors? But I want to clarify your statement further, by following the law, you mean firing Kojima in a legal way that notifies their investors? Therefore there would be an internal statement and statement to investors to clarify this, correct? It would definitely be naive to think that if this statement exists, it wouldn't be leaked. And the statement doesn't exist, as far as we know. So, that means Konami is lying about what? Kojima being fired? Kojima still working there? As far as we know, given their official statement, he's away on "Vacation", if this were true, would there be a need to make a statement to investors to let them know he's working somewhere else momentarily? On the other hand, they could be lying about him being on vacation and he truly was fired. While the statement may have been true at the time, not providing an update to investors would be illegal/lying by omission? Overall I appreciate your statement, my only issue is that it appears you're twisting the info to fit your views. Please clarify as I'm little confused. You're saying, either Konami is lying that Kojima still works there creating potential legal issues, OR he just no longer works there, which doesn't make sense. Either Konami is lying and he no longer works there OR Kojima is lying and he still works there, but one of the two is lying. Konami says he still works there (last official statement), Kojima says he doesn't (last official statement). Kojima still getting paid by konami is an end to the ruse? Or confirmation/supporting evidence? If I had to take a guess, I would assume Kojima is lying, mainly because he's been known to lie, if there is a ruse, he is the mastermind and from what I've gathered from your statements, for Konami to lie would be illegal. Logically it is wise to assume there's a ruse given this information, in my opinion.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>It seems a lot more logical to me that there is a ruse given the information, misinformation, past history, symbolism and parallels to core concepts of the game. Would there be a statement required from Konami to notify investors of the sale or transferring of rights and licenses to a major franchise? I would assume this information is pertinent to investors. Would you be willing to explain why you think the ruse is implausible? Just trying to understand your point of view. I don't think a split is impossible, and seems very believable until you start to look at the bigger picture. Your last statement also contradicts the widely held belief that Kojima was tired of making metal gear solid and Konami was forcing him to work on these games against his will, creating the image of the big bad development studio everyone loves to hate. So I agree with you, it doesn't seem likely at all, though nothing is impossible, not even a massive ruse.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Because Kojima.....is pretty much all you need to know to think there could possibly be a ruse. If you have followed Kojima as long as some of us have here, you would know the man loves to play tricks on his players. Also, you can only play the same old, tired trick so many times before people catch on right? It's to be assumed he has to step his game up if he wants to keep tricking players in the same way. What fun is it for a trickster if he immediately gets caught? The Phantom Pain's reveal let's us know he's willing to go to great lengths to fool his audience, directly lying to people, creating fake studios, fake trailers, wearing disguises, etc therefore a ruse should be expected at this point. To not think there is something fishy going on is to be naive and just asking to be fooled by the infamous trickster.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Ok, thats a good point, I agree with you. I look at this in two ways, and I hold both views until either one's confirmed. Either there is a ruse, or there isn't. If there is a ruse, it's sort of "training" the player to look beyond the stated "facts"/context, almost like training the players to be efficient conspiracy theories, which is probably why some of us appear to be crazy. Now I could be wrong on this, but part of me thinks Kojima may want us to discuss the parallels in his games with real life, maybe in this way we could find some type of clue. Let's take this thought exercise, let's assume (for fun's sake) Metal Gear Solid is loosely based on "facts". If we overlay the story of Metal Gear Solid over reality, there are some parallels and connections we can make. There are a few things that don't add up, like denuclearization, so this may only work if we assume it takes place in a parallel dimension slightly different than ours. It's interesting to consider that Death Stranding seems to play with this concept of different dimensions. I've been wanting to share this video. It's a long, unverified conspiracy theory, although the concepts the man talks about, who claims to be an "ex-cipher" agent, if you catch my drift, sound eerily like the plot of Metal Gear Solid, some of the OATS Labs videos and most importantly, Death Stranding/Silent Hills. Its a long watch, but I think its very interesting. Some of the topics he talks about are secret black ops programs, the people involved, secrets from ww2, antigravity air crafts, beings from other dimensions/worlds, military people who channel spirits, secret bases out in the jungle, possible portals to other realms, time travel, time "slippage", and many more.

    <TEXT>Excellent post, if these things are related, we will have to find out. Some things I saw which were relevant. The Peace Sign/"The Cross of Nero", it shows an upside-down cross broken downward at the cross anchor. It was sign signifying defeat of Christianity. Doesn't appear to be MGs related due to a lack of Christian symbolism/themes in Mg. The V Sign represents the fulfillment of Illuminist founder Adam Weishaupt's satanic "Law of Fives". Also represents the horned Lucifer. This could be a representation of the completion of their plan to brainwash Venom/The player. It could also be a hint towards exposing the puppet masters of society, as it appears to be a recurring theme in each of the MGS games. Aside from these two obvious symbols, its hard to make connections without having a full understanding of the concepts you presented. Although the Metal Gear Solid series has indirectly discussed occultists (Top elites/military industrial complex) I wouldn't expect Kojima to make his fans become occultists in order to understand the point of his games. I think becoming an occultist would be against the point of what Kojima is trying to do here as it is my opinion he must be against them by the way that he subtly exposes the types of operations they do and what type of havoc they wreak. This is a video I posted in a different thread, I considered making a thread about it but decided against it. Its a long two part video, and consists of two interviews. The main interview is an old man who claims to have worked for the CIA. He mentions entering restricted sites such as Area 51, a secret military base deep in the jungle of South America where he encountered a medic known as "Big Surgeon", who was operating on some type of creature/beast/alien. He also mentions how top figures in the military industrial complex are involved with the occult, summoning spirits, contacting demons and interacting with extra terrestrials. It may or may not be related to metal gear (maybe not directly but you can see they share similiar things), but it sounds a lot to me that what this guy is talking about is relevant to the central themes of Metal Gear Solid. There is even a bit where he mentions things that happened during WWII, which immediately made me think of Death Stranding. Here is the video [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yKijQfUK5VY](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yKijQfUK5VY)</TEXT>

    <TEXT>This will be easy because I've already done so, and even made a thread about it. They're mostly gameplay elements, the most obvious is the addition of the stamina bar. I don't know about you, but the first game I ever played with a stamina bar was Dark Souls, so that was the first connection I made. 2nd, in Survive, you level up your character, weapons and armor using a currency you get from defeating enemies, similiar to Dark Souls (and other games granted) 3rd, they incorporated melee combat, which may or may not count, but its definitely reminiscent of dark souls fighting off zombies/undead using melee weapons. 4th, the stats you level up in Survive are almost the same stats as Dark Souls. Last, and perhaps the most telling, when you die, you can retrieve what you lost from death by revisiting the place where you died before you die again, and just like dark souls, if you die before retrieving your items they are lost forever. To add to this, Kojima has stated in interviews that Death Stranding will feature death as a game mechanic, just like Dark Souls.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Demons souls came before skyrim, so you can leave it. Demons Souls is akin to Dark Souls, I'm sure you know this. The leveling up thing is present in other games, that's true, but when combined with these other mechanics, I'm inclined to believe its influenced by Fromsoft Souls games, The same with the melee combat, but this one is probably the weakest of all of these points so I'll give you this one. The stats being the same is true, and if you like the game play of metal gear you are missing out on a fun game. The death mechanic is the strongest link, and while I agree we will have to wait, the similiarities are still there. That is at LEAST 3 strong similiarities. 2 of which are very strong. Redbox Survive for a night or two and check the stats to know what I'm talking about. I'm confident you will enjoy survive if you put enough time into it. Edit - If you ever wanted a mash up between dark souls and metal gear (not sure if anyone did), Survive is the closest thing yet.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Thats a very outlandish theory, but the concepts of the metal gear solid games revolve around military elites/occultists. While it's not completely talked about in his games, it is mentioned indirectly in some ways, such as Otacon having slept with his mother. I think the elitist/occultist themes in the game help to explain some of the weird perversions, but I will admit that is a reach on my part, however, i wouldn't be surprised if Kojima tackles something like that given the growing "taboos" in his games. I also doubt the main character of DS will be a trans, but it appears like it may take place partly during wwII and we all know which characters of the MGS universe were involved during that time.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I definitely hope thats not the case, but It is interesting to note, and I thought you were going to touch on this, that there is a recent conspiracy theory i've been seeing making the rounds which claims that something like 60-70% of people that are involved with the music/entertainment business are secretly transgendered, both male and female. The reasoning is that they want to force the image of the androgynous baphomet on the subconscious, fooling the population unto a fake standard of beauty that's completely inversed with perversion, as a way to condition the public. Many speculate the end goal was to normalize pedophilia, by giving the illusion of consent. In other words, by creating the idea that a child can consent to changing it's gender they can consent to sexual intercourse. Which is just completely sick. Now, if Kojima really wanted to tackle this subject, it would be insanely taboo, despite the current atmosphere. You may or may not have a point, while in this day and age trans people are more accepted than ever, there is still a lot of resistance against normalizing it, but if this were something he wanted to shed light on, this would be the perfect time. I've read a small amount about the Mengele experiments it definately seems plausible to have started during wwII. I'm not completely convinced but it definitely seems possible considering some of the points you've stated.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I agree with your line of thinking, we should look beyond the game. The Metal gear series has always given us pseudo-historical scenarios. What if we recreated a version of history that falls in line with the Metal Gear Series to possibly identify new information we may not have been aware of before. For example, The Philosophers in the story are a parallel for the so called illuminati/secret society which supposedly rules the world. One could potentially discover the history of the "Philosophers" by researching the history of the illuminati. Now this is just an example, there are definitely many more plot lines which could follow. As another example, we know the CIA was training Mujahadeen in Afghanistan during the 1980's, which is talked about in MGS V in several missions. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operation_Cyclone Hmm.....was Venom snake part of Operation Cyclone? Again, just another example to get my point across since i'm having a hard time articulating what I'm trying to say.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>https://case.hks.harvard.edu/politics-of-a-covert-action-the-u-s-the-mujahideen-and-the-stinger-missile/ Do you guys remember this mission?  gt; Abstract:  gt; This case tells the inside story of one of the most controversial episodes in the history of the US intelligence services. Its focus: whether to break the time-honored rules of CIA covert actions in order to supply Afghan rebels (fighting in the 1980s to oust invading Soviet forces) with US-made, state-of-the-art Stinger missiles. The case offers an unusual glimpse into the policymaking process for intelligence decisions, especially covert actions--secret activities meant to advance US foreign policy objectives without revealing the hand of the US government. It describes a pitched internal debate among the Defense Department, CIA #146;s Operations Directorate, CIA leadership, the Department of State, and the Joint Chiefs of Staff over the advisability of providing the Stinger anti-aircraft weapon to Afghan mujahideen. Advocates said the Stinger could help win the war. Opponents argued it made the US role transparent, which could escalate the conflict to superpower level; might increase the risk of retaliation against staging-area Pakistan; and created a threat that terrorists would get possession of the weapon.  gt;  gt; Learning Objective:  gt; This powerfully-written case uses unprecedented access to key players to tell the story of how the Stinger won deployment approval, a decision which some argue helped hasten the fall of the Soviet Union. Well-suited for discussion of both foreign policy in the Cold War era and the dynamics of behind-the-scenes advocacy and internal decision-making. We get out very own account of how this happened (pseudo-historic)</TEXT>

It's also likely that he was in contact with the CIA to some degree during the events of MGSV and beyond. Ocelots role in V is also very interesting, perhaps we should do some research as to any hidden motives Ocelot may have had in playing his role.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Ocelot could be the key. As an individual, he appears in more titles than any other, including Snake and Big Boss. He is a double/triple agent in every game and always doing something sneaky. You raise a really good question. I haven't played portable ops, but I think it is canon, I did a quick search as to why people thought it wasn't and it appears to be a matter of taste. Nonetheless, here is some relevant information, hopefully it helps. http://metalgear.wikia.com/wiki/Revolver_Ocelot This whole page is worth a read through honestly, I'd never read it before and it has a ton of insight, even small details I originally missed.  gt; **Early life and career**  gt; Ocelot was conceived in late 1943 by The Joy and The Sorrow just prior to a secret mission. The Joy learned of her pregnancy during the mission, which resulted in her blowing her cover and being fired upon. Although her unborn child was saved from the bullet, The Joy entered a coma for three months before regaining consciousness. After making a full recovery another three months later, she speculated that her body had willed her to live for the sake of her unborn child.  gt;  gt; Ocelot was born during the Allied invasion of Normandy, France on June 6, 1944 as Adamska. The Joy was wounded during childbirth in the middle of the battlefield, forcing her to give birth via cesarean section and the resulting operation gave her a snake-shaped scar on her torso. Shortly after birth, Adamska was taken from his parents by agents of the Philosophers.  gt;  gt; Adamska briefly worked for the NSA as a code breaker under the codename, ADAM. But he and another colleague defected to the Soviet Union in September 1960. However, a seemingly contradictory account had the youth taken in and raised by the Spetsnaz and Yevgeny Borisovitch Volgin in the immediate aftermath of World War II.[4] Whatever the case, Ocelot would later serve under Volgin's command of GRU while secretly operating as a spy for both the KGB and the CIA; proxy organizations of the Russian and American branches of the Philosophers, respectively. Due to his heritage as the son of a legendary hero, he was given preferential treatment within the organization, promoted to the rank of Major at a very young age, and given command of his own personal squad.  gt;  gt; In 1962, a threat towards Adamska's life was made to his mother in order to ensure that she would assassinate her former comrade (Adamska's father). His life was to have been forfeit if both survived the encounter, ensuring his father's death.[5] Then Snake Eater happens....  gt;  gt;** Post-Snake Eater**  gt;  gt; After Operation Snake Eater's success, the KGB Chief Director contacted Ocelot, where the latter mentioned that Khrushchev was finished, and that the Director's time had finally arrived, as well as suggested that they use the knowledge of both missions as blackmail against America in future negotiations. Shortly thereafter, Ocelot secretly made a call to the CIA Director. Their conversation revealed that the CIA had only acquired half of the Legacy, and it was assumed that the KGB possessed the other half. He also submitted some blueprints of a potential future weapon for the United States. He also confirmed that they had supplied the Chinese with a fake microfilm (revealing he deduced EVA was a Chinese agent).  gt;  gt; Due to his earlier witnessing of Naked Snake being tortured by Colonel Volgin, Ocelot began to research it, eventually becoming an expert in the field. Portable Ops  gt; In 1970, Ocelot recovered the KGB's half of the Legacy and became dissatisfied with the American Philosophers' bickering, which had pitted the CIA against the Pentagon for control of the Philosophers' Legacy. Because of this, Ocelot took advantage of the internal situation while a takeover on the San Hieronymo Peninsula took place. After Big Boss (Naked Snake) foiled Gene's plan to have a nuclear missile hit Langley and the Pentagon, Ocelot secured the CIA's half of the Legacy and **assassinated the DCI in a manner that was indistinguishable from suicide**, hoping to free the country from the Philosophers and attain the entire Legacy (as well as the complete list with the identities of the Philosopher members), as well as planning to retrieve what the DCI stole from both him and his unknown conspirator and thus carry on The Boss's spirit. Post-San Hieronymo/Portable Ops  gt; Ocelot planned to break his ties with his benefactor, until the mysterious man revealed battle data on the Perfect Soldier Project and introduced the concept of "genomes" to him. Ocelot, intrigued, then agreed to join him in the formation of "the Patriots." However, he only did this under the condition that Big Boss be allowed to join them as well. In the pseudo-history, it appears that after Portable Ops, Zero, Ocelot, Big Boss and others broke away from the original Philosophers/Illuminati of the U.S. and formed their own faction from within the CIA. The Patriots appear to have become the dominant faction of the Philosophers and most likely represent the dominant faction in America today.  gt; Zero recruited Big Boss and Ocelot, along with two FOX comrades (Sigint and Para-Medic) and former Chinese Philosophers' agent EVA. In essence, the six founding members were all directly influenced by The Boss, and all were directly involved in Operation Snake Eater either as field operatives or mission support. The group then began plans to reunite the world by governing it from behind the scenes. Zero used his influence to turn Big Boss into a idol-like figure for the world to follow, though Big Boss grew to resent this puppet-like role. The views of the two men also began to differ, in regards to the interpretation of The Boss's will: Zero took the concept to mean control of the entire world by a group under a single will to ensure unification; Big Boss believed that The Boss wanted a world where soldiers would not be used as tools of the government. Les Enfants Terribles  gt;  gt; Tensions between Big Boss and Zero continued to grow. Afraid of losing their idol, Zero carried out a secret project known as "Les Enfants Terribles", in which Para-Medic would use Big Boss's DNA to create a number of clones. this proved to be the final straw between Big Boss and Zero, and the former left the organization with a determination to oppose them and later formed his own mercenary group in an attempt to carry out his vision of The Boss's dying wish.  gt;  gt;  gt; Big Boss and Zero parted ways in 1972.  gt;  gt; After Big Boss left, Ocelot remained a spy for them to keep an eye on the organization for EVA. Zero, Para-Medic, and Sigint stayed with the organization and became increasingly power hungry. Para-Medic became a morally corrupt doctor as the head of FOXHOUND's medical staff and chief geneticist, organizing and developing their genetic research programs. Even though military-based genetic therapy was banned under international law, they were able to get away with it secretly because the laws in question were simply declarations and not actual treaties.[1] Sigint would abuse his position in DARPA by accepting bribes and would participate in the development of AIs. Zero would start to accumulate more wealth and information as his words would start to influence decision-making all the way up to the Oval Office. But he was also hopeful (at the time) that his former friend would rejoin the group in time. In addition, they also started work in converting a United States Naval Base on the southern tip of Cuba into a black site to torture various POWs constantly, and Zero himself went into hiding as a result of Big Boss leaving due to Les Enfants Terribles, issuing orders to his agents via proxies.  gt; Post-Les Enfants Terribles  gt;  gt; While maintaining his position in the Spetsnaz GRU, Ocelot also continued his life as a spy and agent for Cipher (although he secretly resented its policies). He also participated in several wars across Africa and the Middle East throughout the 1970s and '80s including the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan, acting as the GRU's lead interrogator in the region.  gt;  gt; At some point after the fall of Mother Base in the Caribbean, under Major Zero's request, he entered in contact with Kazuhira Miller and the survivors of the Militaires Sans Fronti #232;res (who, by this point, had renamed themselves as the Diamond Dogs) to protect Big Boss from Skull Face and Cipher. He and Miller were not exactly the best of friends but they agreed to work together due to their mutual admiration for Big Boss and their desire to keep him safe.  gt;  gt; It was during the war in Afghanistan that he became feared amongst the mujahideen as a sadist, for which they named him "Shalashaska." At some point, he became the special interrogations advisor to the Soviet forced labour camps, a position he took to hide his real objective of keeping Big Boss safe while he was in a coma in Cyprus. He was also known to have utilized the Lubyanka prison underneath the KGB headquarters as his training for interrogating his victims.[8]  gt;  gt; Ocelot eventually fully allied himself with Diamond Dogs and ended up leading the group in Big Boss's absence due to his status of being in a coma and Kazuhira Miller's capture in Afghanistan. During his time with Diamond Dogs, Ocelot traded in his traditional Single Action Army Revolvers for a pair of modified Tornado-6 Heavy Revolvers.  gt;  gt; Sometime during Ocelot's career in the Soviet military, he met Sergei Gurlukovich, a fellow member of Spetsnaz. Unsurprisingly, it appears he was a double/triple agent for the philosophers/patriots all along, working for Zero the whole time. A revolver ocelot spinof gamef would be kind of cool. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soviet%E2%80%93Afghan_War This was a fun and interesting exercise but I don't think it produced any meaningful answers, perhaps it is because we aren't asking the RIGHT question.......</TEXT>

    <TEXT>It's a slippery slope. It starts with one thing and leads to another. Could anyone have imagined transgendered issues would push to the forefront in 2014? This would not have been possible without the normalization of homosexuality. Keep in mind what I was referring to is a CONSPIRACY THEORY, which isn't rooted in facts but speculation. Nonetheless, a good portion of the subjects presented are definitely questionable when you know what you're looking for.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>You asked a question and that was the answer. You may not like it, and you may not be aware of this, but the reason it became such a hotly contested issue over the last decade was due to a secret clause the Obama administration hid in Obamacare which made it possible for gays to transition gender using tax payers money. That in itself is a part of the same theory. Had that not happened, it's not likely we'd be having this conversation right now. It has been speculated that Obama himself was a closet homosexual and that his wife Michelle was a transgender. Not that there is anything wrong with being gay or trans, but forcing kids to question their gender and forcing it upon them is completely wrong and immoral. Kids don't need to know about all these crazy unnatural ideas, I seriously question if certain people have severe mental issues.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I don't think you're seeing the big picture here. From my point of view, if there is some truth to this it's not the transgenders who are doing it, although some of them may very well be, it is the elite sex cults who have a taste for children. We can agree on one thing, and that is the elite power circles are into some weird and twisted shit. I'm sure we can agree the people in these circles have a lot of influence and power. They use the media to "create context". The context is that a child can make up its mind about identifying its gender, which equates to "consent" for switching to another gender. Choosing a gender is something that equates to choosing a sexuality. A child shouldn't have to think about sexuality in any way shape or form. Just ask yourself why a child would need to choose a gender at a young age, A.k.A. choosing their preferred sex. How would a 4 year old boy come to the right decision that he's really a woman, without every having experienced a woman's touch? It's very easy to manipulate a child into thinking whatever is fed to them. Take this example. My sister used to dress up my younger brother like a girl when he was little (2 or 3), not knowing any better, he thought it was fun because he was getting pampered, all the attention being on him and he was spending time with his sister. My dad, knowing this was wrong spanked both of them and put a stop to it. Today, he's happily married and has 2 beautiful little girls. Had my father not stepped in and does what a father should, my brother may have turned out completely different. This applies to kids being "brainwashed" about genders and all this new age liberal mumbo jumbo. It's all designed to "created context". Kojima knows how they operate, he's been feeding us red pills for the last 30 years. You gotta love him.</TEXT>

Coming to this conclusion on such flimsy evidence is beyond rational logic. You are going off the deep end, friend, and you need to return yourself to reality. Studying Esoteric/Occult topics isn't healthy for anyone. Those are the types of ideas that can drive a person insane. The fact that you had a transition makes me think you weren't very stable to begin with. This isn't an attack on you in any way shape or form.

    <TEXT>Thats understandable, the MGS:0 theory really took off and it did kind of polarize the sub, but it was enjoyable it and it definitely got the sub buzzing again. I'm interested in reading your point of view, I like the idea that PW, GZ are more than just simulations. I started watching Twin Peaks recently as suggested by NBGO'ers and I had a thought, what if P.T. was a nightmare Big Boss had upon returning to the states. Maybe it could be a clue that part of Death Stranding deals with the troubles of adjusting to civilian life as a black ops soldier and dealing with the horrors of PTSD. I'm not sure exactly how this would work within the confines of the game, but its just an idea. It's likely others have had this idea before. I look forward to seeing what you've come up with. It definitely seems to fit within the context. Maybe you've found the missing clue we've needed this whole time</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I had assumed that's what Survive was for, granted it being part of the ruse and Kojima being involved at least during the planning phase. There is evidence to suggest he might have, namely his name being found in the code of the Metal Gear Survive website. (maybe?) It's also strange how P.T. was supposed to be Silent Hills, but instead became DS which looks like MGS featuring Reedus, implying a type of merge between I.P.s,, which interestingly enough, when you play Survive you get the same type of vibe. Metal Gear Solid gameplay merged with zombies/monsters in a fog filled world. It's not exact, but it feels like the beginning of a merge between Metal Gear and Silent Hills. Could Kojima be building upon this? We shall see......</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I'm aware of the MK Ultra program, not in depth, but in terms of the big picture. MK was clearly a central theme in MGSV. I'm not sure if you have played Survive, as not a lot of people have, but the "Philadelphia Experiment" is specifically referenced. In the game, and "in theory", this technology is what lead to the wormhole technology we see in MGS V (although not specifically referenced in MGS V, I assume for speculation purposes). Survive happens immediately after Ground Zeros and concludes around the "post game" of MGS V when you find the wandering mother base survivors with the old photos. From the Article I posted  gt; Rumors that the US government had been conducting experiments in psychological warfare in Montauk at either Camp Hero or the Montauk Air Force Station began to bubble up in the **mid-1980s**.......gave numerous interviews about their involvement in experiments involving space, time, and other dimensions. This is speculating that MGS V, Survive and Death Stranding are connected. In regards to the OP, Sorry to the OP, I thought thats what you meant by "putting the games into context" So I was putting Survive into context for those who haven't played it. I didn't know you had your own context as I didn't read your thread until later. Its just hard to read.</TEXT>

At some point, you send the kid through the wormhole and back to his time, except he goes back to the 1940's when the government was conducting the Philadelphia Experiment and becomes a part of the project. He comes back to help you as a grown man. Seeing how V/GZ, Survive and DS all revolve around worm holes, I think we'll see more the Philadelphia Experiment/Montauk Project. If you're not aware, the Philadelphia Experiment was the US Navy experimenting with Anti radar technology and accidently opening a wormhole to the 1980's. The Montauk Project is a conspiracy Theory/Movie? that build on this premise and takes it to the government using the wormholes to kidnap children in order to conduct psychic experiments. The experiments with children take place throughout the 1970's - 1980's coinciding with "3rd child" from MGS V</TEXT>

    <TEXT>It's important to figure out the true origins of the video. It appears that others believe it was uploaded by Kojima, the YongYea character from youtube has a video discussing it and he believes it was from Joakim as well. Until more conclusive evidence is brought up, I'm more inclined to believe the video is related. Luckily we only have 30 more days until E3, maybe a Kojima rep will see if we're on the right track and give us a nudge in the right direction He does a good job analyzing the message in the screen but the message is not completely clear [](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ydhPAi5Wtes)</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Let's say if Kojima were an organic character in the story of Metal Gear, we know that he matures into adulthood and creates entertainment to tell his story. Like the Boss tells us, there's different factions of "Philosophers" in each nation, often times in conflict with each other in a cycle of war and proxy war. Many people don't stop to consider there might be an alternate version of history that's not being told, as they can't think outside "the box" long enough to consider the reasons why that might be the case. I have considered that if our solar system is but a speck of dust in the milky way galaxy, which is but a speck of dust in the larger universe, and each galaxy being comprised of thousands of solar systems, with millions of galaxies in the universe, the probability of Earth being the only planet with the capabilities of life is laughable. There is nothing crazy about it, it just shows you have an open mind, free from the chain of social brainwashing.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>What is crazy to me is how we are told to believe that all of these things are just a lot of fairy tales yet people who are figures in these "fairy tale" realms are often secretly held in high esteem by the "influencers" of society. One example is Aleister Crowly who regarded himself as "The Beast" and wrote varioius books for summoning spirits. This man was so high in society his daughter went on to become the wife of a president. If you consider there could be a reason why the people in this realm would not want these topics in the public eye, is it that unlikely for them to conspire to keep these things a secret? Especially when you consider the power and influence they have over think tanks and other groups which oversee the "scientific community". "Scientific proof" becomes a fallacy in some ways.</TEXT>

    <TITLE>A Possible "Pseudo-historical/Pseudo-canonical" Recreation of Ground Zeros</TITLE>
    <DATE>2018-05-16 19:08:31</DATE>
    <TEXT>What if the incident was planned long before we suspect? After Big Boss departed from Fox Unit, we know Zero wanted to keep track of him and and maybe others did too. In order to do so, it is possible a "ruse" be devised to "gift" him mother base. What better way to keep tabs on the infamous soldier? [](http://metalgear.wikia.com/wiki/Mother_Base_\(Caribbean\))  gt;The plant was originally built by an American university for use as a research platform for Ocean thermal energy conversion (OTEC), with some assistance from the **U.S. Government**. ..... Shortly thereafter, the plant fell into the hands of KGB (double) agent Vladimir Zadornov, In 1974 the facility was gifted to Big Boss to serve as the FOB for MSF. Mother Base was targeted for destruction all along by the CIA, as it was the original target for the Peace Walker Project until Coldman was betrayed by Zadornov. My question is, could the base have been rigged with some type of "wormhole bomb"? Could this bomb have been placed there by someone other than cypher? **The Philadelphia Experiment** Survive reveals to us the existence of the Philadelphia Experiment and the subsequent experiments/technology developed as a result. This experiment is what lead to the worm hole technology which allows one to travel through space and time. Although in MGS V, the wormholes only allow travel through space, further research into the Philadelphia experiemnt suggests time travel was also possible. The bomb could have been developed after the government expanded on what was originally known as the philadelphia experiment, which eventually lead to the wormhole extractor we see in MGSV. The bomb could have been placed there prior to gifting the base to Big Boss and be used as a "contingency plan" in case the peace walker project failed to wipe them off the map. Which brings me to Skull Face/XOF. Given that they lead to the attack on Mother Base which culminated in the detonation of the "wormhole bomb" I suspect Skull Face may have been a knowing player in this incident. Considering that it's unlikely Skull Face was the director of the "worm hole program" he's likely to be working for someone else besides Cipher, somebody deeper within the shadow gov. XOF going "rogue" and turning on Zero and Big Boss could have been orders from another division. I suspect this to be the case due to some of the "company" we see skull face with 10 years after the incident. XOF commander "Skull Face" is seen with another product of what started as the Philadelphia Experiment, the Third Child. **The Third Child** The following information is taken from sources outside of metal gear but are brought due to their connections with The Philadelphia experiment. [](https://www.thrillist.com/entertainment/nation/stranger-things-true-story-montauk-project-philadelphia-experiment)https://www.thrillist.com/entertainment/nation/stranger-things-true-story-montauk-project-philadelphia-experiment The Montauk Project is said to have been the main project derived from The Philadelphia Experiemnt  gt; During the 1970's, Al was the Program Director for the Psychics who manned the Montauk Chair. .....**The Montauk Boys** were a key program at Montauk, ...... ......His duties were to handle the operations of **the Mind Control program**...... he claimed, he'd worked with Bielek on something called the "Montauk Chair," a piece of furniture that used electromagnetics to **amplify psychic powers**. ....... Duncan Cameron -- the "walk-in soul" child version born in 1963 -- **was found to have psychic powers**...... He tried to harness his adept subject's powers in the Montauk Chair to conduct mind-control experiments using special radio dishes at Camp Hero. This is where the other children come in. In his book, Nichols writes of other boys being brought in and experimented on; some were sent through a portal into the unknown of spacetime. **Duncan establishes a portal** After several years of experimenting with Duncan in the Montauk Chair, Nichols claims that they could reliably travel to other times and places (even to Mars). Eventually, they were able to program Duncan with some basic commands so that the poor kid didn't need to be confined to the chair all the time. How kind. At one point, however, Nichols' superiors told him to turn on the Montauk Chair and leave it running... through **August 12th, 1983.** From this excerpt, we know that the philadelphia experiment may have lead to further experiments involving kids and testing them for psychic powers and sending them through the wormholes. From his name, we can assume kid mantis was the third child to get experimented with. The last part of the excerpt gives us some key information. They had a wormhole open to 1983......According to the source, their most powerful psychic was born in 1963, making him too old to be the third child in MGS V, that is unless he travels through the wormhole during the 70's to the 1980's and stays there as an operative for Skull Face. Speculative thoughts after playing survive..... The Surviving Mother Base and XOF soldiers who were swallowed up by the wormhole were eventually transported to 1984 where they were rescued by a phantom of Big Boss and re-brainwashed into joining their army. Last, I would like to add (since this post is full on crazy) that at some point during the 1970's, the camp where XOF was stationed may also have been inhabited by body snatchers, many of which were killed by Raiden after coming back from the future through a wormhole. Is it possible that not only is Skull Face working for an Ultra black ops faction (Ops so black not even black ops people know they exist) but could it be that he is working for an Ultra black ops faction working in tandem with ultra secret extraterrestrials who have infiltrated our government?</TEXT>

I can't say for sure if it was intended to be this way, but given Kojima's love of weird movies and conspiracy theories, it's likely he was influenced by these things and worked them into the background of his story.

    <TEXT>In another sense, like what MiserySnake is alluding to, it started with Metal Gear and it might end with Metal Gear. With that said, I don't think Death Stranding will be Metal Gear 1 nor the last Metal Gear (if it is metal gear). Take this huge speculative pill with a shot of tequila and some lime and salt. Let's say Archillect is a part of the ruse. His new project has 10 chapters, perhaps Kojima's grand vision encompasses 10 chapters as well. 0. Intro - Ground Zeros 1. MGS V: Revenge 2. MGS V: Race 3. MGS V: Peace 4. Survive? 5. Death Stranding? 6. Left Alive? 7. Metal Gear 1 8. Metal Gear 2 9. Metal Gear Solid: Remake 10. Metal Gear Solid: Legacy Remake Damn.......a man can surely dream..........Only then can the metal gear saga be truly complete. Edit - Now that I think about it, Left Alive doesn't really fit the mold, but I'm hoping it's metal gear related and it looks cool regardless of what it is.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I think to understand what Kojima meant, we must figure out what exactly did he mean by Zero. Was he referring to David O, Zero? Or was he referencing the number 0? or something else? And when he references Omega, does he mean Camp Omega or does he mean a return to the "end". In my own view, I always thought it was a reference to Ground Zeros (Zero) and the events afterward leading us back to events of Metal Gear 1 (to omega - The beginning/end) Another thought I just had, what if he is referring to a time loop? We know time is going to play some type of role in DS, and the philadelphia experiment supposedly allowed for the possibilty of time travel through wormholes, which will also be in DS. I don't know but this is all kind of starting to make sense. P.T.'s time loops, DS "Timefall", MGS V wormholes, wandering mother base survivors, Survive's Philadelphia Experiments. WWII, Ultra Black ops, extraterrestrials, these things are all related somehow.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>One of the most heart breaking experiences I have felt from metal gear was playing Survive and seeing all of the things that were missing from MGS V. It really made me feel like Konami saw how much Kojima was attempting to put into MGS V. They probably looked at him crazy and in their greedy minds came up with the idea of cutting it into various parts. I too felt used and robbed, but in a weird way. At the end of chapter 1 I was blown away, I felt like the story was complete and it was a badass game. Then the Chapter 2 cutscene played with all of those spoilers and I thought, "Wow! Only Chapter 2?! This is going to be the greatest game ever made!!" Then I played chapter 2 and I got that dreadful feeling like I was just robbed from right under my nose! Had they completely removed any notion of chapter 2, I'd have been completely fine but it must have been put there for a reason.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I am perfectly fine accepting Death Stranding as a new ip and coming to terms with the split between Konami and Kojima. Part of me feels like if the split really happened, Death Stranding will be a type of spiritual successor/predecessor (spiritual prequel?) to Metal Gear. The conspiracy theorist in me wants to draw out all of the connections between the DS trailer and the background themes/concepts of metal gear and their connections to actual conspiracy theories. Because of this fact, these connections, I do not buy this idea that Kojima was tired of making metal gear and was forced to by Konami. In my eyes, if he really was sick of metal gear solid he would make something completely different to give himself a breath of fresh air and not create the next spiritual successor in the franchise. It's like, "Hey I'm tired of making this shit! I want to make something different." Gets fired. Goes and makes something similar. It just doesn't make sense. If you are truly tired of something, you wouldn't want to surround yourself with practically the same thing. DS appears different to Metal Gear, until you make the connections between it, Survive, The Philadelphia Experiment, The wormholes in MGS V, they're all leading to the same place. More conspiracy theories, more wormholes, possibly time travel, possibly aliens, and to me this is the core of the story of metal gear. Not the time travel, worm holes and aliens, but CONSPIRACY THEORIES. We shall see soon enough though with more information. DS GOTY 2018!!</TEXT>

    <TEXT>That's actually a very cool premise. A different type of "end of the world" scenario I'd never considered before. I could definitely see that as being a possible concept in DS and would eliminate any notions that it's metal gear related. If that is what Kojima is making, it could be very interesting. . On to the scar, could it be that maybe the baby was put INTO his stomach? He definitely doesn't appear to be pregnant. As for why he has a baby in his stomach, I just can't think of a good reason. Him previously being a woman who transitioned into a man, I suppose, is the most logical explanation but then why is the baby still in his stomach? Although that could be explained as the scene with the baby in his stomach happens before the scene where he's washed up on shore naked. I am at a loss here, I'm not sure what to think.</TEXT>

In the first scenario, how is it possible for the Boss to birth Ocelot? (test tube/jar baby is actually a good explanation)...... Damn......you got me. Norman might be trans boss. -edit - Wait....while thinking about this, if that were the case (Norman transitioning into the Boss M to F), their wouldn't be a scar. The only explanation for the scar would be a c-section to take the baby out implying that if Norman is transgendered, he would have to transition from F to M, but then how can we explain her appearance in 1964 during the Virtous Mission and Snake Eater?</TEXT>

    <TEXT>That definitely seems like a plausible scenario. I also expected Chapter 3 to be metal gear 1 but from Venom's perspective. It would have been badass to play until the end of the game and fight Solid Snake as the final boss. You have to beat him to win the game, but as we all know, the post fight cutscene shows Solid Snake outmaneuvering Venom for the kill. DS being metal gear 2 would blow a lot of people's minds. Talking about Grey Fox made me want to rewatch this [](https://www.bing.com/videos/search?q=MGS+Gray+Fox+Dies amp; amp;view=detail amp;mid=9A1CB1C69F300363AAD09A1CB1C69F300363AAD0 amp; amp;FORM=VRDGAR)https://www.bing.com/videos/search?q=MGS+Gray+Fox+Dies amp; amp;view=detail amp;mid=9A1CB1C69F300363AAD09A1CB1C69F300363AAD0 amp; amp;FORM=VRDGAR I'd never seen this version, holy shit @ those moves dodging bullets like the matrix.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I disagree with the last part of your post. Storm Rush was good the way it was as a punish in duels. The only negative aspect was that the attack only came from one side but that didn't matter if you caught someone mid attack, which happened often for me. Although they made it omnidirectional now, the new animation and timing seems to be a huge nerf, as well as the nerf they did to riptide strike. Sure, its faster now but like Storm Rush, I feel its not as effective as it once was.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Fair enough, I tried my hand at the rework and faced too much frustration on a game I was already losing interest in. Before the rework I'd say I was good with Orochi, better than decent. I won tournaments, fought and killed multiples many times, and I had a specific timing for all of his attacks and mix ups that most people just didn't know how to react to. Only a few characters gave my Orochis trouble and that was Highlander, Warden and sometimes Nobushi. Smurf or high rep, it didn't matter, he was viable. Now, since they changed the timing and animiation on almost all of his attacks, my previous playstyle was completely dismantled. Gone is the timing I had for his side lights, and while they are faster now, they are less effective for me than they were before. The same with riptide and Storm Rush. My problem is that I have 21 Reps in this character and everything I once knew is gone out the window. I'm not interested in learning all the technical aspects like exploiting frames in order to be good, that's just not fun for me. My playstyle wass mind games and mixups, but like people have said, that style appears to be gone replaced with "fast lights" meta.</TEXT>

Not only is ISIS no longer a threat, transgenders are no longer getting sex change operations on American tax dollars and are no longer taking over every aspect of of our society. Aside from that, he's been the closest of any president to reach through to North Korea! If you really can't uderstand, you need to open your eyes. Hillary Clinton is an obvious criminal who holds herself above the law, and we're all witness to this! Any allegations against Trump so far are baseless. It's been over 1 year and still waiting for proof of "election hacking" which Obama said was impossible and you loonies believed it, no evidence of "collusion" and there is no evidence of this claim on this thread other than hearsay!</TEXT>

But they need to be aware that if the ruse exists and DS is Metal Gear, the game was NEVER FOR THEM, IT WAS FOR US. The RUSE IS FOR US. DEATH STRANDING IS FOR US, the Metal Gear die hards who know Kojima and his works. He did all of this for his fans, so they could be surprised at the reveal of his new Metal Gear Solid game.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I understand your frustration, but its my opinion that even low effort posts contribute something to the conversation. I can tell by your arguments that you are of a specific personality type which tends to focus a great deal on the details but also tend to lack the intuitiveness to see the big picture. Others like myself are somewhat opposite, we disregard the details to look at the big picture. I bring this up to create a point that all contributions help in some way, even if you can't see it at first. The low effort post which you are complaining about specifically could be the catalyst which inspires someone to think of something people may not have thought of before. This is a group effort, most of us are here for the same reasons or something similar. I don't understand why people specifically come on here to talk down on others and try to insult people. Perhaps it is based on ego, but whatever the case, we'll get closer if we work together. If you disagree with someones post, its ok to say, "Hey man I disagree with your post for this and this and that reason and I think this, this and that is actually going on." What I don't think is ok is saying something like, "Hey man you're fucking stupid, you're theory sucks, get the fuck out." Or something along those lines. I'm not pointing any fingers, but its completely possible to disagree with someone without throwing out insults or tyring to belittle someone. I'm not pointing any fingers, but I see this happen alot.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>It's definitely possible, I'm not saying its not. What I'm saying is, I would prefer for it to be Metal Gear because then it ties all of these "Aliens/Other world" conspiracy theories with the conspiracy theories already present in Metal Gear. Metal Gear 1-4 teaches us about the Philosophers and their plans. Death Stranding may show us how "THEY LIVE" and have been here all along. It shows who's pulling the strings of "the Philosophers". It takes everything we think we know, and shoots it into overdrive to another dimension.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I merely said that to show contrast between the differing personalities of people and while some SJ type personalities are capable of having some intuition, they tend to lack that particular function as it is usually something they develop/work on, which tends to happen later in life for them. And thats fair, having strong details are a core part of your personality. You focus on the facts, first and foremost, but one of your types biggest flaws is that you hold on so strongly to facts and what can be proven that you disregard anything that can't be proven by a scientific model, despite the fact that science is flawed and is severely limited to our understanding. To add to this, people of that personality type tend to dismiss anything that can't be immediately proven, without taking the time to think critically as to why not and continuing on in their speculation. You see, much intuition is required to hold opposing views. You must believe in something and disbelieve in it at the same time, holding the idea that both views can be true. Take this for example, the claim that secret socieites run the world. On one hand, because it can't be proven, many will believe that this claim is simply untrue and impossible. Because the sources where these ideas originate from aren't your typical mainstream news, many will believe these claims to simply be fabricated. However, to the intuitive, they will see these sources and take it as it is, not fully believing the claims to be true, but holding it as a possibility in the back of your mind, until more information can be gathered on the subject which you can add to your view/opinion on the matter. Over time, as more information is revealed to an intuitive, they will use that intuitive function to put the pieces together, like a puzzle, forming an overall "BIG PICTURE". This type of circular logic can be very difficult for an SJ type who only focuses on the major details which can be proven beyond a doubt. I think the problem is that you don't see any value in the posts you are complaining about, but my point to you is that while you may not see any value in it, others might. Although you are right about some of the information being flimsy, it still has some value for the intuitive who is gathering all of these small, seemingly unimportant pieces and uses them to build his speculative vehicle to express his/her ideas. The thing about Archillect is, it can't be proven if he/she/they are working with Kojima or not. They may or may not, and that is a problem for SJ's because it can't be proven and if thats the case, to you it is meaningless. I think everything that is posted has some type of value, even if its small. I guess the problem arises where if you can't share that small detail here, where else? This seems to be the only place where at least SOME of the people care about that type of info, and while some may have a distaste for it, there are still those who appreciate it, like myself. I see you are passionate about metal gear, like most of us here. I just believe we can do more by working together instead of tearing each other apart, and that includes giving constructive criticism over flat out insults and being dismissive. If you can't find the value in somebodies post, thats fine, but you can't decide for others if there is value in something or not.</TEXT>

Not having done any research on the matter I can't give much of an opinion other than what people have speculated here. I don't like the Archillect posts much either but in the occasion they are somehow related I would like for them to be posted here so I can see them, but you have a very good point.

In the same way the knights have romans, the pirates could also have pirates from other cultures so chinese pirate or other type can be used and would be badass. -realism be damned!!</TEXT>

    <TEXT>What if skullface is just skullface? Not Big Boss, not Venom, not Chico, not Kid Mantis.......just skullface? That's my theory anyway. I think its cool how Big Boss was a legendary mercenary in the "Black Ops" world and he was dominant for a good while but all along there was another mercenary in the "Ultra-Black Ops" world, which is a world so secret we have only gotten a glimpse of it through the actions of Skullface. This "Ultra-Black Ops" mercenary eventually went on to defeat the legendary Big Boss and his entire crew, to reign for 9 years until his demise by the hands of Venom-Snake. He put Big Boss into a coma, sent a portion of his crew and the remains of his base to "another dimension", and the rest of his crew dead at the bottom of the ocean. Skullface is as much a legendary character as Big Boss, if not more. How did he get in contact with "Third Child" / Kid Mantis in the first place? It makes you think what types of projects he was involved in, especially considering the possibility he may have had access to "Offensive wormhole technology." Imagine hating your enemy so much you devise a ruse to plant a wormhole bomb under their base to send him and his crew off to another dimension, literally. That's legendary.</TEXT>

If you can get past the crappy way the story is told, and you can overlook the repetitious side missions, you will find a game who's gameplay is kind of like Dark Souls and Metal Gear Solid V had a baby and out came this kind of mediocre game with really deep mechanics and satisfying gameplay. Despite its flaws, the game is really polished and is fun to play.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>The show Stranger things was inspired by The Philadelphia Experiment/Montauk Project. I have speculated that Death Stranding is also based off The Philadelphia Experiment/Montauk Project based on what we've seen from the trailers. Interesting to note, the storyline for Metal Gear Survive is also based on The Philadelphia Experiment. https://www.thrillist.com/entertainment/nation/stranger-things-true-story-montauk-project-philadelphia-experiment My theory was originally posted on NBGO here https://www.reddit.com/r/NeverBeGameOver/comments/8jxli1/a_possible_pseudohistoricalpseudocanonical/ This was where I first began to speculate on these connections https://www.reddit.com/r/NeverBeGameOver/comments/8ftap2/mgsds_and_aliens_origins_of_the_philosophers_the/ Skullface is Skullface Theory https://www.reddit.com/r/NeverBeGameOver/comments/8plxx2/skullface_is_skullface_theory_low_effort_post/</TEXT>

If you read the article I posted it states that the show was originally titled "Montauk", not to mention that The Philadelphia Experiment was originally conducted in 1945, which ultimately resulted in what is known as "The Montauk Project". These two incidents have been regarded as "Urban Legend" for decades and have been the inspiration for countless movies, shows, games, etc.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>As someone who has been playing since the beta, I would have to say that's probably pretty damn normal. The reason I say this is because looking back on the early days, when everyone was fresh and the difference between play styles, I would only expect a new player to get wrecked every single time due to the depth of the mechanics and how much time everyone has already had to get to know the characters and moves. My best advice is the same I used to give players when the game first launched. These things are crucial, counter guardbreak, parry and feint. Practice vs level 3 bots before every time you go PVP. You will find one character which destroys you every time, play level 3 bots vs 99 times.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>It sounds incorrect, the idea I got from the baby is that it is used to see the ghosts/demons. I'd often thought of the idea that baby's, being closer to birth, have a stronger connection to the spirit world. Perhaps in the world of Death Stranding, they are aware of this ability of newborn babies and exploit it through their technology. Not sure if there is any truth to this though, just an idea I had.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>There were too many posts being made, I had information overload. I also got a weird feeling from this trailer, but I've been theorizing it might be connected to Metal Gear Survive through some of the concepts in this game. The Fog filled world (the upside down like some people call it), the alien landscapes, the monsters, transporting materials and corpses. It has a very MG Survive type of vibe, although it looks 100x better graphically and probably every other way imaginable. My question is why? Its so weird...... I am confident Kojima won't let us down, but I am not sure what to make of the baby just yet. Is he just cargo? Occult tech? A clone? A future human? It's hard to say....</TEXT>

At least I think that's how it works considering they don't use up any bed space while on deployment. Also make sure your farms are maximized and you have all your cages full. You may also need to upgrade your mutualisation facility.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I've been making this theory for a while. I went really in depth at least once or twice. People tend to hate that DS might be connected to Survive in any way other than here, where people can freely share their theories. The timeline is possibly Death Stranding MGS3:Snake Eater Portable Ops Peace Walker Ground Zeros Survive MGSV MG1 Mg2 MGS MGS2 MGR:R Death Stranding I think death stranding will involve time travel seeing that it seems to take place in the past and the future.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Interesting to read this because I was having a similar thought last night. I was thinking about the picture you get at the end of the story with the words "Vic Boss" and I was contemplating why Vic? The answer that popped in my mind was perhaps Venom/Vic is the 5th iteration of Big Boss. Big Boss from SE/PW/GZ was the OG, if Ahab is a real person he might be the 4th, if Venom is the 5th, this would mean there are 2 other body doubles of Big Boss. There is no evidence to support this though, its just an interesting thought.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Yes, I theorize that DS is the continuation of MG: Survive, in a way. This is going to sound crazy, but if you look up the Philadelhpia experiment, it all ties in. There have been rumors for decades of secret government projects where they travel to other worlds, just like the show Stargate SG-1. MGS always been about government conspiracies, I think this might be Kojimas next source of inspiration. "The Philadelphia Experiment" and its successor "The Montauk Project".</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Spot on. The ability for time travel was one of the unintended consequences of the Philadelphia experiment along with teleportation via wormholes. I never knew the about wormhole pin, its definintely reminiscent of MGSV. I have to agree with you about everything you've stated. I didn't know most of these details or hadn't considered them in this light, but its just adding more fuel to the fire that DS is probably MG: Survive 2. I had been considering posting a full fleshed out theory on this but I'm pretty sure people are going to hate it judging by the amount of hate MG:S got. THis new metal gear sounds really badass, I hope we're not wrong about this.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I've got a few questions, mainly in regards to how masturbation fits within the practice of sex magick. From my understanding, a mans semen is his energy/life force, aka chi as known in the eastern traditions. When you have sex, you trade this energy/life force with your partner in return for some of their energy, but what happens when you masturbate? When you have your hands on your dick, are you also a closed circuit? What are the implications of this? When you ejaculate from masturbation, is it only a loss of energy? Are there any occult/esoteric reasons to stop masturbation? I've been wanting to ask these questions for a long time, I just wasn't sure where. Maybe you can help</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I want to throw my theory in the pot just for fun. I think its going to be a metal gear solid game (5) where you play as big boss after the worm hole explosion on mother base. He's given an offer he can't refuse (his entire force having been destroyed and getting picked out of the ocean on his death bead he's forced to comply) and that is to work for them in a ultra secret project. The project is traveling through wormholes to other dimensions to transport ultra sensitive cargo and other secret operations. This is just one aspect of Big Boss that nobody knew before now because it has always been ultra top secret, until now. It's perhaps one of the biggest secrets that if people knew it would shatter the current perception of reality.  #8203; MGSV is what it was. A red herring to throw people off the scent. Everyone thought Venom Snake was Big Boss. The whole world bought the lie. Except Venom Snake never saw Big Boss ride away on the motorcycle. Why would he have that memory if he wasn't there? The fact is, Venom Snake was a victim of induced hypnogogia which means false implanted memories.  #8203; "They played us all like a damn fiddle!"</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I read a theory somewhere that the Ouroboros was symbolic of the time during an ancient Epoch when Saturn was supposedly the main source of light and appeared in the sky like a big angry eye. Accordingly, this was during the epoch of the Titans when Chronos/Saturn/Anu was the main deity of the pantheon, before the epoch where Zeus dethrones him and becomes the major deity.  #8203; Apparently, it's also the origin of the all seeing eye. Chronos/Anu/Odin/Saturn. P.S. - i didn't watch the video</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Supposedly, it was a time before the Sun was the main source of light. I found it to be an interesting to the parallels of Z. Stitchin who claimed there was a time before the Earth was formed as we know it now, in which a larger planet inhibited this space was struck by another planet in a head on collision. this created the debri we know now as the asteroid belt. According to Stitchin, the Earth was formed afterward from the remains. The mythology was that Anu/Saturn and his cohorts (the planets in it's orbit) were attacked by another deity and it's cohorts (planets/moons in orbit) where the deity for the previous "earth" was destroyed by one of the new comers and knocked it into a different orbit closer to the sun. The deity which arrived to fight Anu/Saturn/Chronos dethroned him as the main deity, the same way Chronos was dethroned by Zeus. This was the beginning of the new Epoch which was known as "the Golden Age" of mankind. According to the theory i mentioned first, the time of Saturn was known as "The Purple Dawn" Here is a link [http://saturndeathcult.com/the-sturn-death-cult-part-1/a-timeless-age-in-a-purple-haze/](http://saturndeathcult.com/the-sturn-death-cult-part-1/a-timeless-age-in-a-purple-haze/) Maybe mankind was present at some point during the age of the dinosaurs in some form, perhaps not as homo-sapiens as we're known now but a more animalistic, primitive version. Maybe they witnessed these events happening in the sky and were embedded in the human psyche for ages and passed down through folklore and mythology. According to that theory anyway, interesting stuff.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Thats true, I have to say that the idea originated in a book I read by a man named Z. Stitchin who spent a lot of time deciphering the myths on the sumerian tablets. Although his work is very controversial, he does mention an event that could have had the power to shift the orbit of another planet, which I explained in my previous post. Imagine a head on collision between two planets. Stitchin theorised that Earth was at one point between Mars and Jupiter, perhaps as one of Jupiters Moons. According to him, Another planet, Planet X, traversed through our solar system and one of it's moons, our moon, smacked into Earth, knocking it out of its orbit to where it is now and, closer to the sun, then being captured by Earths gravity to become our moon. According to science, there was a point in history where a huge cataclysmic event happened that changed everything about Earth as it was, which destroyed all of the dinosaurs. It makes sense to me that this cataclysmic event could have been the collision of the two objects recorded by the ancient tablets. If that is the case, it raises the question how humans were around to witness it or how would they know of this event. The only evidence that I could think of this event would be the existence of the asteroid belt. To what else can we attribute the ring of rocks between mars and jupiter?</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Thats why I think its best to keep it a secret, the less people know about it the better it works. I try to avoid stores where I know the employees are aware of brickseek, especially the electronics manager. I've heard accounts of employees admitting to stashing items in the back for employees only.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I've been theorizing this as well. I think some, if not most, of MGS is based on something that happened in real life. It could be that he is an insider who knows these extraordinary things which he wants to share with the world in some way and just so happens to be a genius game developer.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I understand your ignorance, the knowledge of secret societies and their impact on the world isn't something that is spoken of often, due to it's secretive nature, therefore when people bring these subjects up, the unaware tend to think it's nothing but crazy talk. However, I would suggest to you, that if you're interested in understanding why people have these views, that you do a little bit of research on certain things and after some reading, you might change your perspective.  #8203; To get an idea of the full picture, start at the beginning. Look up the term "Mystery School" and attempt to figure out what it means. Try to understand why there was a need for these groups in the first place. Know that these groups never went away, since ancient times, they have been operating behind the scenes carefully guiding society through it's evolution using a hidden hand.  #8203; Next, look up the term "Hidden History" and see what you find. Then look up the hidden history of America and the hidden history of the freemasons/knights templars. Last but not least, do a search on the largest secret societies in the world and try to learn some of their history. Just be warned, knowing this much can mess up your sleep at night so I hope you have strong nerves.  #8203; Aside from all of the transgender stuff, if you really want to learn about it, I think that's a deeper part of their philosophy than just knowing their history. I have read that some of these views are outlined in the book "Morals and Dogma" which came out in the 1800s but in it makes references and outlines the need for 3 World Wars, 2 Vs Germany and the last Vs the Muslim world. It also touches on "the dissolution of marriage" and other subjects if you still don't believe there is an organized effort to lead people towards sin. May you be cleansed of your ignorance.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>**"The idea that a changing of traditional roles toward homosexuality being accepted as normal is evidence of a grand conspiracy is quite clearly an irrational belief born out of homophobia"**  #8203; This is actually a false statement. If you read the book "Morals and Dogma" by infamous Freemason Albert Pike, you will understand that there has been a plan set forth since probably before the publication of this book in 1871. "They" have been working towards this agenda for the last 200 years.  #8203; Do yourself a favor and do some research. Don't just go on babbling out of ignorance but actually try to understand.  #8203; Also, in regards to Beyonce and Jay Z, Beyonce has been seen on various times showing off the baphomet in photo shoots which is a symbol widely used in occult groups/secret societies. Jay Z has been photographed wearing a sweater with the words "Do as thou wilt" which is the slogan for a very powerful and infamous secret society which prides itself as an "anything goes" type of group which leads to some very perverse and powerful individuals.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>You haven't read enough on the subject to make that statement. You can choose to remain ignorant but I won't spend much time trying to educate you more than I already have. What is more legitimate than the horse's mouth? The Freemasons are a very large and very real organization. Like I said, cleanse your ignorance. If you are just here to troll, so be it.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Listen, I'm not saying that Beyonce isn't attractive or successful. She is a beautiful and talented woman, and Jay Z is a talented musician and business man. With that said, it doesn't negate anything I have said. You can be successful and rich, and still be in a cult. As a matter of fact, specific cults are ONLY rich and successful people, look up NXIVM. There's a specific cult that produces PRESIDENTS, look up skull and bones. You using Jay and Beyonce's lyrics to prove your point just shows how you just believe what you're told, so long as it comes from a position of authority, which by the way, is a tactic used to control people. Assume a position of authority, and people will believe whatever lies you say, so long as they don't question authority. Which causes me to question what kind of person listens to Beyonce and plays Metal Gear solid, and isn't aware of these perspectives considering they play a big part in the core of the story. It is a game but the concepts parallel things that have taken place in real life. So why are we here?</TEXT>

    <TEXT>There are definitely references to the "Illuminati" in Metal Gear, except the word "Illuminati" doesn't mean what you think it means, which is why I told you to study all those things I said earlier because that is a more precise definition of the concept people are referring to when they mention "Illuminati". The term is nothing more than a general statement to denote someone who is a part of a secret society, these secret societies which make up the worlds elite. Go back and play MGS 3 and listen to THE BOSS talk about the history of the philosophers. Secret societies are not fiction, I can almost guarantee they have a presence in whatever city you live in, and there is no overstating the effects and control they have on society. You just don't know, your ignorance is astounding. Did you know some of the more famous U.S. presidents were Freemasons? George Washington? A secret society founded the most powerful country the world has ever seen, how is that an overstatement of their power when it's not well known, but still a fact.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>You seem to misunderstand what I'm trying to say. I'm not implying that Metal Gear Solid is non-fiction. What I'm saying is what you just reiterated. Rich and powerful people influence society, and belong to specific groups, whom are the ones referred to as "Illuminati". There is no need to continue further in this discussion, you have proven my point.</TEXT>
