    <TEXT>Welcome to /r/CommentRemovalChecker! Here, you can find out if your comments or submissions been silently "shadow" removed without your knowledge! Our bots check for comments/submissions that appear only to you, but have been removed from Reddit by subreddit moderators (or AutoModerator). *** ### How to use our sub: **SUBMIT a new text post with the username you want checked.** e.g. If you want to check removed comments/submissions of /u/redditor, simply enter `/u/redditor` as your submission title. You might not be able to see your submission, but the bot can still see it. **The bot will run a check and notify you when it is complete.** (Due to current server resource limitations, you can only receive one check every 24 hours.) *** ### [Search your username here!](/r/CommentRemovalChecker/search?q=title%3A%22Removed+comments%2Fsubmissions+for+%2Fu%2F{username}%22 amp;sort=new amp;restrict_sr=on amp;t=all) *** ### [Help us expose social media bias and censorship!](https://www.patreon.com/blessbots) *** ["Leaderboard": Users with the most removed comments/submissions](/r/CommentRemovalChecker/wiki/index) [Track the subreddit's growth](/r/CommentRemovalChecker/wiki/subscribers)</TEXT>

    <TITLE>***[NEW FEATURES]*** Runs Faster  amp; Receive a new check every 24h!</TITLE>
    <DATE>2020-01-01 19:01:54</DATE>
    <TEXT>Due to server resource limitations, we previously limited users to one check every week. But [thanks to our Patreon patrons](https://www.patreon.com/blessbots), we've upgraded our server. **You can now receive one check every 24 hours!** In December 2019, we also rewrote ALL of our code from the ground up to make it run faster. Checking removed comments/submissions for one user used to take 10 minutes. Now, the same check completes in less than 5 minutes! We also noticed that our bots' posts were getting removed by the **Reddit admins**! This is beyond our control. But we changed the format of our bots' comments to evade the spam filters as much as possible. We have several new features planned for 2020! Stay tuned! [Please contribute to help us improve our service!](https://www.patreon.com/blessbots) We want to bring you better features, but we can't do it without your support. Please share our sub far and wide! https://www.reddit.com/r/CommentRemovalChecker/</TEXT>

Facebook gets to decide what content appears on their site. `g8mmb9m` in `worldnews` on 12 Oct 20 (1pts):  gt; There is no "healthy discourse" to be had with Holocause deniers. Facebook hasn't banned other types of misinformation here, only Holocaust-denying.

    <TEXT>Hi /u/stable_entropy, **you're not shadowbanned**, but 29 of your most recent 103 comments/submissions were removed (either automatically or by human moderators). ### Comments: `g8lt2qd` in `news` on 12 Oct 20 (1pts):  gt; The hypocrisy of the media. `g8jp2h6` in `news` on 12 Oct 20 (1pts):  gt; Are there 16 stadiums that they can play in? `g8jox8v` in `news` on 12 Oct 20 (1pts):  gt; At a certain point, you need to just get on with life. I am very glad the NFL is playing. `g8jouao` in `news` on 12 Oct 20 (1pts):  gt; New Zealand is an island with less than 5 million people. It was extremely easy for that country to isolate itself. `g8itkfv` in `news` on 11 Oct 20 (1pts):  gt; Like it or not, u/Thebiggestslug is correct. `g8ithbp` in `news` on 11 Oct 20 (1pts):  gt; Should we sacrifice the well being of the future generation to protect a generation that is going to die soon regardless? `g8i75bn` in `news` on 11 Oct 20 (1pts):  gt; Taxes are assessed by the city, so that would mean the city is racist? Interesting since the cities with higher black population tend to be very Democratic. `g8hol2n` in `news` on 11 Oct 20 (1pts):  gt; Thin Blue Line; it shows support for law enforcement officers. Entitled morons, like u/JustOKBoomer, think it is racist for some reason. `g84br3f` in `news` on 08 Oct 20 (1pts):  gt; People in the USA are more likely to wear masks than people in Canada. The USA is a much larger country than Canada, has much larger cities, and has a much larger international population. `g84bhqe` in `news` on 08 Oct 20 (1pts):  gt; NHL/NBA are a lot smaller; they could operate in a bubble. That does not work for the NFL. `g84bdl4` in `news` on 08 Oct 20 (1pts):  gt; No one makes them play football. They also make a ton of money doing it. `g80rxtp` in `news` on 07 Oct 20 (1pts):  gt; Well, that matters. A mob was trespassing on their property. `g80rqe6` in `news` on 07 Oct 20 (1pts):  gt; Being she was on private property, and the mob broke down a gate, I think she would be in the right. You cannot trespass and then pull a gun on the land owner. `g80cjv0` in `news` on 07 Oct 20 (1pts):  gt; It does; and it provides much safer water than most of Europe. `g7v0mnd` in `news` on 06 Oct 20 (1pts):  gt; Watched it. Still a conservative. `g7uimmw` in `news` on 06 Oct 20 (1pts):  gt;  gt; Then the president would go into zombie territory just to prove it's not dangerous  gt; Like how Nancy Pelosi went to China town? `g7uh0hj` in `news` on 06 Oct 20 (1pts):  gt; Never understood the college thing. It is easy to vote if you are in college; just request an absentee ballot. That is what I did. I do not understand all of this whining. `g7ugtb4` in `news` on 06 Oct 20 (1pts):  gt; Where are people waiting 8 hours to vote? `g7ub9km` in `news` on 05 Oct 20 (1pts):  gt; This is not exclusive to the USA. `g7r0tv5` in `news` on 05 Oct 20 (1pts):  gt; No. `g7qzuow` in `news` on 05 Oct 20 (1pts):  gt; Flown twice since this all started. Went out to dinner a few times, about once every other week now. Heading to Disney World next week. You need to stop being so afraid. `g7es6gu` in `WaltDisneyWorld` on 02 Oct 20 (-16pts):  gt; We are going in a few weeks. It is very far from a deadly airborne virus. `g77g6s7` in `news` on 30 Sep 20 (1pts):  gt; You really should read the article. `g76btko` in `WaltDisneyWorld` on 30 Sep 20 (0pts):  gt; OP comment was also funny. `g762hrt` in `WaltDisneyWorld` on 30 Sep 20 (-7pts):  gt; Do you know who the father is? `g74du2b` in `news` on 30 Sep 20 (1pts):  gt; Same here. I am really hoping they do not cancel the season or any games. `g74d7mf` in `news` on 30 Sep 20 (1pts):  gt; You are so edgy. `g6w7zbi` in `worldnews` on 27 Sep 20 (1pts):  gt; Not Canadian. ### Submissions: `j5lg15` in `WaltDisneyWorld` on 05 Oct 20 (0pts):  gt; Has the MinnieVan Service been discontinued? *** I'm a bot.

    <TEXT>Hi /u/Usedbks1982, **you're not shadowbanned**, but 26 of your most recent 110 comments/submissions were removed (either automatically or by human moderators). ### Comments: `g8quewr` in `politics` on 13 Oct 20 (1pts):  gt; Lol Sotomayor was the only one who dissented. That's why the r/politics bots aren't up voting this. It makes Kagan look bad. `g8qt7kl` in `politics` on 13 Oct 20 (1pts):  gt; I love Mitch even though I'm not from Kentucky. I just love how he lives rent free in the minds of Trump-haters across America. He will go down in history as one of the greatest speakers of all... `g8qlwo4` in `politics` on 13 Oct 20 (1pts):  gt;  gt; There is so much cross racial crime in America that I am frightened. There are areas where people are afraid to go just because of their race. Its no good. The vast majority of crime is... `g8q74n7` in `insanepeoplefacebook` on 13 Oct 20 (1pts):  gt; If wearing a mask is equivalent to being pro-life then I expect Democrats to stand against abortion. Oh wait "baby lives don't matter". `g8nv0b2` in `insanepeoplefacebook` on 13 Oct 20 (1pts):  gt; Considering most so-called "native american" are like 1/8000000th "native american" then the poster is probably right. She wouldn't be here without Europeans. `g8n3uo4` in `insanepeoplefacebook` on 12 Oct 20 (1pts):  gt;  gt; What do you want from that? We're gonna run the country how we see fit.

    <TEXT>Hi /u/everestLOC, **you're not shadowbanned**, but 8 of your most recent 102 comments/submissions were removed (either automatically or by human moderators). ### Comments: `g5nxily` in `AdviceAnimals` on 18 Sep 20 (1pts):  gt; You're just a fucking weirdo. Don't try and tell yourself you're some quirky, introvert genius. You're just that office weirdo. People would stay away, with or without your "tricks" `g2repxv` in `canada` on 25 Aug 20 (1pts):  gt; And yet Albertans are still smug about their oil economy. Maybe diversify your economy away from a destructive resource and it might do better. `fxvjc2c` in `canada` on 12 Jul 20 (1pts):  gt; Do you think all the climbers came out to help because they wanted to sleep with the hot organizer? You see this on crags all the time `fxj546d` in `teenagers` on 10 Jul 20 (1pts):  gt; The fucking entitlement of this post. Someone else is cleaning your fucking room and instead of being grateful, you're being an inconsiderate, ungrateful turd about it.  gt; Life is gonna slap you... `ftrg6hm` in `metacanada` on 12 Jun 20 (1pts):  gt; Lol based on the shithole that is most of Republican America, most normal Americans would be fine with this. Let the inbred racists breed each other into extinction. The world would be a better... `ftjl4z2` in `metacanada` on 10 Jun 20 (1pts):  gt; Don't bother.

    <TEXT>Hi /u/everestLOC, **you're not shadowbanned**, but 8 of your most recent 102 comments/submissions were removed (either automatically or by human moderators). ### Comments: `g5nxily` in `AdviceAnimals` on 18 Sep 20 (1pts):  gt; You're just a fucking weirdo. Don't try and tell yourself you're some quirky, introvert genius. You're just that office weirdo. People would stay away, with or without your "tricks" `g2repxv` in `canada` on 25 Aug 20 (1pts):  gt; And yet Albertans are still smug about their oil economy. Maybe diversify your economy away from a destructive resource and it might do better. `fxvjc2c` in `canada` on 12 Jul 20 (1pts):  gt; Do you think all the climbers came out to help because they wanted to sleep with the hot organizer? You see this on crags all the time `fxj546d` in `teenagers` on 10 Jul 20 (1pts):  gt; The fucking entitlement of this post. Someone else is cleaning your fucking room and instead of being grateful, you're being an inconsiderate, ungrateful turd about it.  gt; Life is gonna slap you... `ftrg6hm` in `metacanada` on 12 Jun 20 (1pts):  gt; Lol based on the shithole that is most of Republican America, most normal Americans would be fine with this. Let the inbred racists breed each other into extinction. The world would be a better... `ftjl4z2` in `metacanada` on 10 Jun 20 (1pts):  gt; Don't bother. The average poster here is an inbred incel who blames the fact that he leads a shitty life bootlicking on foreigners and minorities. They will never understand anything beyond hate. `fq8ev48` in `worldnews` on 11 May 20 (7pts):  gt; So you had no issues with his comment of "look at all those stupid white people, Asians would never do this"? `fq8ceyj` in `worldnews` on 11 May 20 (-6pts):  gt; Yeah, they were all at home eating bats. *** I'm a bot.

    <TEXT>Hi /u/JoeyBobBillie, **you're not shadowbanned**, but 43 of your most recent 200 comments/submissions were removed (either automatically or by human moderators). ### Comments: `g97513b` in `uvic` on 18 Oct 20 (1pts):  gt; Either way I have to sift through spam. Thanks. `g95prti` in `uvic` on 18 Oct 20 (1pts):  gt; Yeah there's totally no conflict of interest in profs requiring you to buy texts they wrote. `g8xf5ut` in `uvic` on 15 Oct 20 (1pts):  gt; What I mean is that people who don't cheat will get lower marks on average or at least have to spend more effort while the cheaters will have no real danger of being caught. `g8xf1gt` in `biology` on 15 Oct 20 (1pts):  gt; Thanks `g8v5a4u` in `uvic` on 15 Oct 20 (1pts):  gt; That's subjective. `g89rmu9` in `politics` on 10 Oct 20 (1pts):  gt; I mean he's not wrong, I see an uproar here after all. `g7v07fp` in `cancer` on 06 Oct 20 (1pts):  gt; Nah, physicians have to give all the details an objective reasonable person in that patients position would want for there to be informed consent. They don't want to be sued so they almost all do... `g7haa4i` in `JusticeServed` on 03 Oct 20 (1pts):  gt; That's when you gotta give it a good solid punch in the nose. It's going to stop bitting then. `g7h984r` in `worldnews` on 03 Oct 20 (1pts):  gt; So them being dead instead of in jail is going to make a difference somehow? Nope. `g74htf1` in `news` on 30 Sep 20 (1pts):  gt; Idk why anyone would be surprised. Canada non-voluntarily steralized disabled women until mid 1970s `g6q8360` in `worldnews` on 26 Sep 20 (1pts):  gt; Who knows though, some people have gotten fired for sharing non antisemitic memes with Hitler in them. `fxs2fv8` in `ShadowBan` on 12 Jul 20 (1pts):  gt; bc ur gay `fxrxhdn` in `u_kn0thing` on 12 Jul 20 (1pts):  gt; I don't think someone should be picked because they're black, white, Asian ect.
