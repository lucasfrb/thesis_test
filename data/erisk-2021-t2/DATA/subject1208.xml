    <TEXT>1983-1985 accomplished a lot for them though the *overall* quality of the music was hit or miss. They had 2-3 good songs on each album during those three years that got MTV coverage. The tours were somewhat weak in sales. Hot in the Shade was probably the start of original fans feeling nostalgic for KISS (Smashes, Thrashes and Hits was double platinum the year before). Revenge captured yet another new audience for the band. Less than 5 years later they were selling out reunion shows around the globe.</TEXT>

One day I carefully opened one of his reminder letters from the charity and replaced the contents with a very well-written letter stating that  #8220;due to his failure to continue supporting his foster child, the child died #8221;. He opened that letter while he was drunk. He nearly put his fist through my bedroom wall. He was emotionally wrecked until the last line of the letter which gave it away as a prank.</TEXT>

With a worldwide virus getting ready to erupt in a second wave, there is no way to launch a war or promise a cure. The Republican Party will realize they have no chance of winning with Trump. But... if they can swear in Pence and keep his gaffs insulated from the general public, Republicans can bet on a closer race against Biden. Republican supporters who have given up on Trump will be swayed by the opportunity to support their preferred party with a candidate who hasn #8217;t truly been exposed for his incompetence. Even some fence-sitting Democrats who can #8217;t stand Biden could be persuaded.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>There #8217;s a bigger explanation behind this in Chris Lendt #8217;s book. Lendt was the travelling accountant for the band from 1976 to 1988. KISS #8217; financial situation through the 80s was that they had to keep producing albums and tour in order to keep income rolling in to pay for their debts and lifestyle (this includes staying on top of all expenses including health insurance). Even though Eric #8217;s death occurred three years after KISS fired their money managers in 1988, they were under pressure to keep releasing material or have no income at all. They had to move forward with the Revenge album to meet contractual obligations, and earn income. Had they not recorded what ended up being a very successful album, they would not have been able to sustain themselves. The reunion in 96 changed all of that (they #8217;d never have to work again after the success of just that one tour) but without Revenge in 1991, KISS would have been bankrupt. Hot in the Shade in 1989 was also necessary for their financial survival and the song Forever helped finance them for another 18 months. Ever since the inception of KISS, so much money has had to be earned to keep the company moving along. Their shows are expensive, their clothes are expensive, they never really sold a crazy amount of albums to cover their costs. Producing a strong song, and then touring has always been mandatory for their existence. This is obvious from their output for the first 15 years of their careers. Gene and Paul get too much grief for Eric #8217;s state of mind at that time. Without them doing what needed to be done, Eric and Bruce weren #8217;t going to collect pay checks.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Again, if they didn #8217;t produce something they would have not been able to cover Eric #8217;s insurance at all. Eric lived near them in LA and was part of their lives on a regular basis. Then he upped and left for New York in a bad state of mind and cut them off from any information. I really can #8217;t blame them from moving forward but it was tacky. There was never going to be a proper solution. There was  #8220;what #8217;s best for Everyone or what #8217;s best for Eric #8221; and they chose  #8220;best for Everyone #8221;.</TEXT>

Foreign donations will be 1/100th of what was provided after 911. Need help bombing Iran? Suddenly other countries don #8217;t have your back. So, yes, Biden will be much better. Over 200 countries on this planet are in no hurry to help the US with the current leadership. Any help will feel like an obligation, not a good deed.</TEXT>

If we were living in a time with only a few tv channels, that would have been one of the most talked about moments in pop culture. It was progressive, tasteful, important to the climate of western civilization. The way the actors captured the importance of real life change in laws - just from a single look and word - was masterful. Reflecting on it, the series should have showcased their marriage as far more stable and less cluttered with idiosyncrasies.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>So, I #8217;m struggling to understand if this is a joke? Do you mean that when you play it, the album is the first side of Alive II? Nothing in your photo indicates a mistake. Those four songs are the first side of the Destroyer album. Great Expectations never appeared on a live album (and probably never got played in concert). And the actual pressing of Alive II only starts with Detroit Rock City and King of the Nighttime World. The third song is Ladies Room. Even the year on the label is correct. Alive II is 1978.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Okay. That helps a lot more. That is really cool. It would take a specific kind of mistake to press the wrong side of two master recordings. Best guess is that KISS started to explode in Europe and likely a series of copies got pressed incorrectly. There was probably a major demand for Alive I and Destroyer. Hold onto this and give us an update. I wish I had the spare cash to make an offer.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I #8217;ve re-read each of their books multiple times. I #8217;ll rank them here with some thoughts. 1 - Paul #8217;s book was the most complete. It gave us new information about his childhood and allowed access to his private life. As the most reserved member offstage, I trusted his recollection of events the most. What I found disappointing was how he glossed over his friendship with Gene. He gave some props to him but also highlighted a lot of negative things about Gene. I felt Paul owed more to Gene in his book. Peter - His book was arguably the most honest because he admitted a lot of things that addicts have a hard time admitting to. His childhood was covered in depth and he also detailed how bad things were for him after leaving the band and having to play clubs. And he highlighted Gene #8217;s softer side at various points. What I disliked about his book were the number of contradictions not caught by his writer. In one chapter Peter would talk about giving the band his all day-in/day-out but by the next chapter he #8217;d openly admit to hating touring and recording and never having privacy and purposely screwing up. Also, some stories seemed exaggerated. Gene - While he #8217;s my favourite member of the band, his book didn #8217;t offer any new information. He makes a lot of bold statements publicly and I expected his book to be a treasure trove of honesty but he really just dictated everything that you can find in interviews or magazines. His childhood was covered to some degree but Gene purposely avoided talking about personal information (having half-siblings and buying gifts for family he never met). He has a big heart and it would been nice to have him really expose it. Ace - His book is frustratingly absent of first-hand stories. He gave a good recollection of growing up and how he was inspired to be in rock and roll but then the book kind of just jumps ahead a few years at a time. It was as though he didn #8217;t want to relive parts of his life and so we are given halfhearted tales from his partying days. He clearly has a lot to be embarrassed about and he didn #8217;t confront his demons in the book. The thing that drives me crazy about ANY bio or autobiography from ANY musician is how little they touch on the fact they had to practice, practice, practice. Ace didn #8217;t become a great guitarist overnight... how many hours a day did he play? Why did Gene pick up the bass? When did any of them discover they had great singing voices? What was the first thing they bought when they knew they were millionaires? So many interesting tidbits could have been covered.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>That #8217;s a good question. Phil sells multi-million dollar homes and must earn massive commission. Claire went to work for her dad and likely pulled some nice cash for a while. They never worry about money. But then Phil got a big commission and and Claire wanted to pay Jay back. I #8217;d say the show messed up on explaining how Phil can sell one house per month on average but they don #8217;t have an excessively crazy lifestyle. Kids #8217; college is paid for but they mentioned how hard it was to afford to send two off to school. On paper they would be worth about $2,000,000; Phil #8217;s success would suggest otherwise.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>The answer is  #8220;No #8221;. Ace doesn #8217;t have a great singing voice. He can sing in tune but he #8217;s not strong. The reason why it #8217;s fun to hear him sing is because he was an important contributor to KISS and there was an aura to him for *not* singing. When he finally did sing on Shock Me, it gave him another level of contribution that fans wanted. Prior to their explosion as a worldwide phenomenon, hearing Ace on an early KISS album would have severely damaged credibility for the band. They never prevented him from singing but he wisely chose not to and they were better off for it. Once superstardom hit, people were willing - and happy - to accept that Ace would get lead vocals. If he had warbled  #8220;Cold Gin #8221; on the first album, people definitely would have said,  #8220;Huh? What is up with this voice? #8221; After their massive success it was a different story.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I #8217;ve asked myself the same thing but have never found an official answer so let me take a stab at a guess. 1) There is/was an extreme cash payout for writing a Top 10 song. Musicians/performers have long understood that the real money in music comes from being the writer or publisher of a song... not the performer. There is almost no value to a performer to do a cover of another person #8217;s music except that it might propel the sales of an album with their own music on it. There is a lot of evidence of this from classic performers like Johnny Cash and Elvis; they almost always performed other people #8217;s music and released 2 or 3 albums per year just to earn enough income. Had they been the writers of their entire albums, they wouldn #8217;t have had to release so many albums in a year. The publishing companies paid them to perform other people #8217;s music. 2) Once KISS exploded, the individual members retreated from one another in their personal lives. They almost never saw each other after tours. Gene and Paul didn #8217;t return to New York and hang out with each other so they never wrote together after 1976. Peter and Ace would hang out but only to party. 3) Referring back to my first and second points: 50% of the work for a hit song was already achieved just through KISS #8217; notoriety... that #8217;s what KISS brought to the table, a spotlight/head start on every album or song performed. Co-writers were thrilled to collaborate because KISS already had notoriety; KISS was happy to collaborate because they really never cracked the Top 20 with their own songs. Two of their most famous songs in the top were  #8216;Beth #8217; and  #8216;I Was Made For Loving You #8217; which were both cowritten... and made them enormously popular with new fans and extremely wealthy. There is a MASSIVE difference in earnings on song royalties once you crack the Top 10. Every radio station and every record sold around the world played/ sold a Top 10 single at a rate so much higher than a song *not* in the Top 10 that the revenue would be jaw dropping. If writing a Top 10 song depended on collaborating with anyone as much as you needed to, it #8217;s totally worth it. Think about it this way: a movie that wins Best Picture at the Oscars goes on the resume of **everyone** who worked on it whether it was the director or the guy who holds the boom mic. Who is involved doesn #8217;t matter if the result is successful and provides riches. Edit: spelling</TEXT>

BoJack: Uh-huh Todd: and I realized, everyone misunderstands that song. BoJack: The Hokey-Pokey? Todd: Yeah! There's way too much emphasis on the "Hokey-Pokey" part. BoJack: That is what it's all about #8212; Todd: No. That's exactly what I mean. That's not what the song is saying! BoJack: Okay #8212; Todd: And I was thinking about my mom, you know, my relationship with my mom. It's weird. You know, awkward. I feel like she doesn't really get me, but, you know she's trying. And a couple years ago, I never thought I would have any kind of relationship with her like I was sure of it. BoJack: What changed? Todd: I don't know, I did, or she #8212;did? or um #8212;we are? BoJack: Huh Todd: So that's what I'm talking about, Its like the song says, "You do the hokey-pokey and you turn yourself around." You turn yourself around, that's what it's all about. [Todd does the dance move from the song] BoJack: Yeah, I don't know if the songwriters put that much thought into the existential significance of the lyrics. They literally rhyme "about" with "about." Todd: But isn't the point of art less what people put into it and more what people get out of it? BoJack: Is that the point of art? Todd: Maybe. Or Maybe art doesn't need a point. Maybe that's why it's called art. BoJack: I can't tell if you are being smart or stupid. Todd: Oh, I never know. BoJack: I think you had it for a moment and then you lost it. Todd: [laughs] Oh well, It was nice while it lasted, right?</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Setting a precedent of donating an entire income is not noble. Former President Harry Truman - and likely many presidents before him - faced poverty after their time in office. Presidential pensions were created so that great men wouldn #8217;t forego public service if it meant living with nothing once their terms were served. Anyone who praises Trump or other  #8220;wealthy #8221; people for donating their salaries are basically saying: poor people and middle-class people have no skills or abilities and shouldn #8217;t try to make a difference. And you #8217;re probably the only person aside from Donald Trump to use the word  #8220;noble #8221; to describe Donald Trump. Edit: Trump and his family are forbidden from running charities in NY state because, well, they didn #8217;t run them legally. Such a noble *billionaire*.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>This is going to sound bizarre but your help would be appreciated. In November of 2012 I was on a business trip to your city. My clients were on the outskirts so I stayed in the outskirts. But another client of mine was also in Chicago and we made plans to meet after her conference. That night, while I was trying to leave the downtown core, I got lost. The GPS in the rental car couldn #8217;t find a signal, I had no glasses on, and the nighttime construction of closed roads made me really nervous. Due to my unfamiliarity with Chicago I kept turning in to courtyards and dead end streets or streets under construction. I remember getting turned around at what looked to be an old courthouse. Then, I was on Madison. What happened next is what has haunted me for 8 years. I entered what I believed to be an on-ramp/tunnel. Instead, I drove up a steady incline that curved counterclockwise through a white cement hallway. I thought  #8220;Oh, I must have entered a parking garage. #8221; Only, there were no parking spaces. I continued on this incline for about three or four minutes, winding upward through a narrow space. Finally, I encountered a lone construction worker (this was nearing midnight) and he waved at me to stop.  #8220;What are doing here? #8221; he asked incredulously.  #8220;I #8217;m lost. I #8217;m not from here. How do I get out? #8221;  #8220;Turn around here and go out the way you came, #8221; he commanded. When I finally got outside of the building, the GPS started to work and I made my forty-five minute drive back to my hotel. Where could I have been?</TEXT>

    <TEXT>For this to be true, we'd have to believe that four separate producers: Eddie Kramer, Sean Delaney, Vini Poncia, and Jeff Glixman all sat on this secret for 40 years (Delaney died). KISS cranked out a new album every five months; it's not inconceivable that four separate albums could be produced at one time. That's not to say that Bill Aucoin didn't have this idea in his head... fun marketing idea; groundbreaking. But there's no logical evidence this was some secret contained by KISS, their producers, their managers, and a host of other staff close to the band. EDIT: the world freaked out when they learned that KISS ALIVE was fixed up in the studio (like every other live album on the planet at that time) and KISS owned up to it during their reunion. Why would they suppress this information about four rather unsuccessful and unremarkable solo albums? EDIT #2: Chris Lendt, traveling accountant for the band, who was fired by KISS around 1987 and has no love lost for them never came close to mentioning this in his book. He, in fact, went into great detail about the expenses associated with the cost of the solo albums and the traveling Paul did and the concern around Peter being able to complete his. This is just a fun myth.</TEXT>

I filed yesterday and it said this was my last payment, file is closed. Do I need to reapply? Is this over for me?

Every 2 weeks I #8217;ve signed into ServiceCanada internet reporting to complete a file.  #8220;Have you worked? #8221;  #8220;Were you ready and willing to work? #8221;  #8220;Did you earn any money during the last two weeks? #8221; Questions like that. Then yesterday it said  #8220;This is the end of your claim for employment benefits and no further reports can be filed. #8221; I #8217;m thinking... what if I had signed up for CERB first and then applied for EI? Wouldn #8217;t that have been better? Am I out of luck for having opted for EI when this started because I knew I qualified? Edit: when I signed up for EI I didn #8217;t receive it for six weeks so I attempted to apply for CERB but the system said  #8220;you #8217;ve already applied for EI #8221; and I know that I never knowingly received CERB.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>No to the yacht comment. Trump owned one before. It got sold to pay for bad debts (1992 #8217;ish, I think). They #8217;ve already embarrassed themselves once before by trying to own a yacht. And if there #8217;s one thing Trumps never do, it #8217;s embarrass themselves repeatedly. Ditto for owning airplanes, casinos, steaks, vodka, universities, mortgage companies, spring water, board games, magazines, sports teams, racing tours, fatherhood, presidency, marriage. If you take that small list out of the equation, they still have yet to embarrass themselves by creating a telecom company, and... sawmills?</TEXT>

When people actually want to use a keyboard, they will choose the one that suits them the most. For hundreds of millions of people in the west, this will mean QWERTY survives for decades upon decades. But, a  #8220;hip #8221; generation will use whatever is deemed scientifically or functionally more proficient. And then there will simply be custom keyboard. QWERTY isn #8217;t going anywhere for at least 70 year. Can #8217;t comment on non-English countries.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>There seems to be a lot of upset people regarding the polyamory comment. It was never my intention to shame people who want or are in polyamorous relationships. What you need to know about Mormons is that they ONLY CHANGED THEIR MIND about it when the United States threatened to not let them remain/become a US state. Suddenly - *magically* - God spoke to their leader and polygamy was no longer something God wanted of them. Very, very convenient. But if the new leader suddenly had God on line 1, and polygamy was going to be reintroduced - guess what? Mormons would suddenly have a change of heart. It was about hypocrisy; not relationship shaming.</TEXT>
