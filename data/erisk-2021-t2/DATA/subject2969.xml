    <TEXT>Just preordered mine on EB games Aus, $429 for an Xbox X is unheard of. Not to mention, a spanking limited edition based of a blockbuster game which also comes included with the first expansion pass. It #8217;s an insanely good deal. I know the Xbox Series X is just around the corner but I don #8217;t care! I #8217;ve learned not to buy consoles on launch, it #8217;s almost always a bad deal. Here is an expensive and an untested new product (so I #8217;m paying just to be a guinea pig) that #8217;s most likely going to have mountains of manufacturing issues, and few new games to play on it. No thanks! I will wait a few years before I even contemplate getting the Series X, by then it most likely have a revised new model - which is better on design, look and price not to mention tons of awesome games to play at a fraction of the original price. That #8217;s a win-win for me.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Good plan, don #8217;t worry this is by far the best limited edition Xbox one console this gen. It #8217;s a collectors item and will be coveted for the years to come. I reckon I could easily sell it way more than I #8217;ve even paid for, not only recouping my costs but pay for my next Series X when the time comes. But yeah, buying the X series on launch seems so silly to me especially when the new next gen games are still going to be playable on Xbox one. considering purchased games today will be cross-gen anyway. So whatever way you look at it, we #8217;re not missing out.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Nah I don #8217;t trust third party studios. They #8217;ll just see this as another project to milk. This is why Microsoft bought all these studios, they realised the old strategy which is relying on third party studios was nothing but a cash grab for them as they didn #8217;t put a lot of love into these games and it shows. I think Microsoft should move 343 to their own project. I see a lot of similarities in their situation with Sony #8217;s Gorilla games. These guys for over a decade could never pull of the Killzone franchise, which was supposed to be Sony #8217;s answer to Halo. Until they decided to move to something and found their niche which was the 3rd person adventure game we now know as Horizon zero Down. So yeah who knows</TEXT>

    <TEXT>That #8217;s right, and the reason Microsoft heavily relied (and failed I might add) on third party studios this generation is because of their lack of first party studios. Something had to change Over-reliance on an outside entity is usually a very bad strategy for any business long term, it #8217;s usually overburdened with costs and inefficiencies. One example, I always like to use is how Gearbox ripped off Sega with Aliens colonial marines. While Sega funded the game in good honest trust, Gearbox took that money and spent it on other projects they were making. This is why I #8217;m always very skeptical of third party studios...</TEXT>

Never mind the announcement of STALKER 2 which for me was a  #8220;mic drop #8221; moment as this game is HUGE in its own right. Do we hear anything about this? Nope, in fact it #8217;s zero, zip, zilch. Let #8217;s instead focus on minor graphics details, whatever. The gameplay was very impressive, the art style was also very encouraging as 343 seemed to have abandoned their misguided art direction in the last two Halos and adopting the old Halo art style. Which was in my opinion was never realistic but stylised look to it.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I think Hellblade 2 will be amazing. Ninja Theory is an amazingly talented team, with a budget behind them. I think Hellblade will be like a Horizon zero Dawn type of open world game, I expect to see gameplay maybe next years E3 (if there #8217;s even one) and probably be released by end of 2021/early 2022. I #8217;m also very excited what the new Initiative team has got in the works, I have no idea what it is but if it #8217;s Perfect Dark. I think I #8217;m going to pass out. Avowed also looks extremely intriguing, I have full faith in Obsidian as Obsidian with a budget behind them can do almost anything. Although we won #8217;t get hands on this since development started early 2019 (maybe a little before that) I expect release date to be somewhere in 2022, maybe at latest 2023. So yeah lots of games to be exited about. As well new MS studio acquisition rounds, my money is on Asobo studios which made the awesome Plague #8217;s Tale and are now making Flight simulator (which I don #8217;t know if you #8217;ve seen it, looks quite simply unbelievable) coming out on PC and Xbox at a later date.

    <TEXT>I #8217;ve had this game for over a year, loved it to bits and only started playing it again after a long hiatus. Sadly, as it was the same case back then. The achievements are almost all very rare. This is a great fighting game, in fact one of the best I played but it saddens me deeply that nobody is playing it. What the hell is going on? If Microsoft pulls the plug on this franchise thanks to the lack of engagement and indifference towards this game then I won #8217;t be surprised.

    <TEXT>Bro there #8217;s a Hadith on this where the Prophet  #8206; #65018; condemns women who are wearing clothes but are naked. They are categorically condemned, he does not make distinctions between them at all. It #8217;s to the point that I #8217;m now contemplating leaving the country I reside in now and relocating to a Muslim country. Somewhere far far away from this type of daily fitnah. I dread even going to the shopping mall these days because I know I will be bombarded from every angle. I also don #8217;t like how you #8217;re painting as some sort of a misogynist, when all I #8217;m doing is pointing out these fitnahs. Women are a fitnah for men, do you know that? There #8217;s a saheeh on this. And the fact is, feminism is corrupting these people even further when they are already disbelievers. In the 1950s women and girls used to wear long dresses, and they were just as fine without the need to wear yoga pants and short shorts. These are all excuses to dress immodestly to try to entice men, and the truth it #8217;s working. To the point of fooling even Muslims like you. I stand by what I said, I believe in it 100%. And I won #8217;t be backtracking it one bit because I know the truth is on my side. May Allah guide you and me, ameen.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>My post only claimed that women who dress in provocative way are doing it for male attention. Is that wrong? No, some women who dress this way crave attention and so by that knowledge, I won #8217;t give them my attention. Is that misogyny? No. The mods can do whatever they want. They were overzealous, most of the comments agreed with me. So yeah, got nothing to regret. I say what I think and I don #8217;t care if it offends you or anybody else. Bye  #128075; #127998;</TEXT>

Then I #8217;m sorry, that #8217;s all on you. To succeed on nofap you gotta really want it.</TEXT>
