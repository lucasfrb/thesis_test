    <TEXT>My favorite shift is night shift! In my agency, the day shifters (officers and dispatch alike) are all senior (as in seniority, lol) people and its just hard to connect with them (I'm 20). To stay awake on nights, I MDT with the officers or strike conversation with the other dispatchers. As for staying healthy, I tend to bring salads for lunch and walk around comm center during the slow periods or do squats because it gets boring lol. On night shift, I notice I sleep a lot less (9 hours on day shift vs 4 hours on nights), which generally helps with productivity during the day when I need to clean or walk the dogs or whatever normal people do lol. I also prefer nights because, since the activity is slower, there's more time to do homework for students or catch up on assignments.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>ESH. 7 is definitely old enough to know not to harass animals or smear shit everywhere in someone else's house. OP should've just continued saying no to babysitting based on the simple fact they don't like kids. Sister sucks for guilting OP into babysitting knowing they didn't want to. I agree, to an extent, that when you're left in charge of a child you're responsible for their discipline, but not locking them in a room like a dog. Help them clean the mess they made (to show you're a good role model) and stick them in a corner for a few minutes as punishment.</TEXT>

    <TITLE>How do y'all deal with awful supervisors?</TITLE>
    <DATE>2019-12-15 00:49:34</DATE>
    <TEXT>Hello, all!  #8203; I'm a rookie dispatcher (10 months on the job) and we went through a huge comm. center shift in supervisors, including getting a new manager. TLDR, the manager and one supervisor retired at the same time, making a supervisor a manager and leaving only one super. To cope with this, we NEEDED people to step up into the super positions ((due to short staffing)), one on eves and one on mids. They both have about 6 years experience and 3 years CTO experience. The mids super is fantastic; she's patient, willing to help whenever, and often helps on our shift to fill scheduling gaps on her days off. The eves super (my direct supervisor) is not so nice. She consistently belittles rookies (there's 3 people in training and 6 people fresh out of training, me being one of them), yells at officers on the radio, snaps at other dispatchers for asking questions, etc... I've worked in the food industry since I was 16 (I'm 21 now) and have been the manager in any restaurant I've worked in, so I've never had to deal with a bad supervisor before. She's just so mean lol. Not even callers are like this.... Help or advice is appreciated.</TEXT>

Our comm center has 28 full time and 6 part time. Edit: We use 4 shifts, each with at least 5 people on it, with more people on day shift and two people on a swing shift. A amp;B shift work 0700-1900 and C amp;D work 1900-0700 with the swing shifts being 1100-2300 on either A or B shift's days.</TEXT>

She has a few tattoos and her lobes pierced, but supported me getting my ears pierced to my hearts desire; that being said, when I asked for my nostril/septum to be pierced (age 16) she told me no, so I did it myself. There weren't any complications, but it definitely caused a rift in our relationship. The day after I turned 18 I went and got it done professionally. I asked her to sign off on a tattoo for me when I was 16 and she said no to that, too, so I got it done illegally and behind her back. Kudos to you for knowing that it's just self-expression! You sound like a really good parent.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>YTA. 911 dispatcher here. This is more often than not agency policy. 911 calls automatically generate calls for service and you cannot close a call out unless there is an address, and depending on that agency specifically, that call may hold there for an undetermined amount of time until someone puts an address in the call. You can literally say "I live at 123 Main St, but my family and I are about to head out to run some errands. If you would like an officer/deputy to check on us, we will be back around x time." We have a hard enough job without someone being rude to us over the phone over us wanting to ENSURE YOUR CHILD IS OKAY.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Honestly, they're looking for honesty. My mom is a probation officer for the same city I work in, so one of the questions the manager asked me was "If you had just taken a call that your mother was shot in the line of duty at work, how would you respond?" Obviously the answer I wanted to give was "just react like I would react to any other gunshot wound call," but I was honest and said "I haven't been in that situation, so I can't tell you exactly how I would respond." That's the answer that set me apart from the other interviewees-- my honesty. My interview as a panel style interview and it was recorded, which scared me lol. As for real questions, they vary from agency to agency, so it's hard to tell what to expect. My best advice is to be honest, be yourself, and answer as best you can to your ability, even if you have no idea what the answer is lol  #8203; Good luck!</TEXT>

    <TEXT>We have two dispatchers in our center that are having very, very similar issues. One (we #8217;ll call her Megan) gets very flustered when people tell her she #8217;s doing something wrong, or when they get snippy at all. She is also extroverted, but her shift mates are introverts. They switched her shift and CTO to our shift and she #8217;s doing loads better now. So maybe a change of shift would help him? With more patient, for lack of better term, dispatchers? The other one (Sarah) is incredibly introverted and also on our shift (full of extroverts). She was also put on our shift to build confidence, but it really just isn #8217;t working. Our manager wants to dismiss her but our shift is  #8220;the nice one, #8221; so we #8217;re all trying to help her. With her having such a poor radio ear, she listens to the scanner on her off days and tries to decipher what #8217;s going on. After work, we all watch the same shows, so we have her summarize the latest episode to pick up on important parts. As for sense of urgency, that #8217;s not something I think can be taught, other than a reminder they peoples #8217; lives could be on the line? Lol Hope everything goes well for you and your rookie  amp; hope you #8217;re all staying safe :)</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I'm a 911/police/fire/medical dispatcher. Last night we had an elderly gentleman go missing from his house at 7:30pm and wasn't reported until 11pm. Around 2am we found we had sufficient evidence to issue a Silver Alert (for those not familiar, it's a statewide broadcast that is a "be on the lookout" for an elderly person with a diminished mental capacity, such as dementia). At such time, we sent out a mass notification to all those *who signed up for* these notifications; they come in the form of text message and phone call/voicemail. Since that message went out at 2:30am, we've gotten dozens of calls where people are complaining about the calls waking them up, how they want to complain to the sergeant or police chief or whoever will listen about how they didn't want to be woken up.  #8203; One woman called in and straight up said to me "This old man running away is not an emergency to me. I signed up for these COUNTYWIDE notifications in case something happened to my family member. I don't care about this guy going missing." and when I tried to explain to her how to opt out of the notifications, she hung up on me after telling me again she didn't care.  #8203; How can people be so cruel to each other? This old man is their neighbor, their child's friend's grandpa, a member of our community, he's a person. How can no one but us, and his family, care? Edit: update! The male has been found and he is safe!</TEXT>

Are you mad at me?" and if she says yes, try to talk about it and ask why she's been so mean. If she says no, say something like "we have a mutual friend who said you were mad at me." Honestly though, 13 for girls is such a formative year, I would drop her as a friend entirely. I had a similar issue when I was around that age and I just stopped being friends with her, because if she'll lie to my face about being my friend, what else can she like to me about?  #8203; Good luck!</TEXT>

    <TEXT>So, I work in a career field that almost requires a dark sense of humor. Most of us use it as a coping mechanism and that's fine, but at what point does it stop being dark humor and start being a shitty person? We took a call today where someone was attacked by a homeless person and my coworker said "Maybe she learned her lesson about helping homeless people," and I just got so angry. Victim blaming and dehumanizing the homeless all in one sentence? Wtf, man.</TEXT>

Amanda showing up put those peoples' lives at an unnecessary risk. Second, Amanda seems actually crazy, so I'd take anything she says with a grain of salt and keep my distance from her. It is very strange that she outed her daughter to a stranger, but wouldn't tell her "friend" that she's gay. Amanda is mad that you told your coworker because she thinks being gay is a sin, so she's embarrassed someone else knows her daughter is a sinner. I'd just ignore her and stay far away from her if at all possible.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>FL dispatcher here. Every agency has a different CritiCall test and most times the CritiCall isn't an accurate representation of the agency's actual systems or policies. I'm on the east coast and almost all of our local agencies require a 50+ WPM typing test, so work on that first. Familiarize yourself with the city/county you want to apply for and brush up on your map reading skills. Look into the curriculum for the Florida certification [on the FDOH website](http://www.floridahealth.gov/licensing-and-regulation/911-public-safety-telecommunicator-program/index.html); it'll be easier to learn it if you have at least a vague idea of what you're getting into.</TEXT>

Those people that were picked (and agreed to being on the team) send out a monthly email to just check on the people in their group.
