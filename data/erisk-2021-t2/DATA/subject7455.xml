    <TEXT>Speaking personally, I was born this way. It's always (to best memory anyway) how I've felt most comfortable being and short of electro shock treatment or brain surgery I think I always will be the same. I can imagine circumstances/trauma affecting peoples behaviour too, but for me, it's just me.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I'm T1 on injections and completed my first marathon in Manchester this year (slow time but it still counts). It's a physical strain of course, but as long as you plan your insulin (I tend to not inject until post race and I've had a chance to refuel a bit) and carry what you'll need (or look up the content of race stations before hand) and carry enough stuff and it was very do-able. Diabetes has never stopped me doing anything to be honest.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Pretty much that area, but then I carry/pick up things like [isotonic gels](https://www.amazon.co.uk/Science-Sport-Isotonic-Energy-Gels/dp/B000P2ZIGY) to maintain the level. I tend to find I'll feel like I go up initially but then come down quickly after a while (based on feeling, I've never tested on course), so these things taken at fairly planned intervals keep me steady. Most races supply now, but I have 1 or 2 on me in case of emergency as you don't want a hypo on the course.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Personally, I kind of agree, as in I'm one of the people who didn't think we needed a ghostbusters 3. Loved the first, liked the second but, for me, it was done. I didn't think the casting was great, but not only was it inevitable with the director, it could have worked. Kristen Wiig and Melissa McCarthy are capable of being funny at least. However, then I saw the trailer. The style of humour and the depiction of the characters immediately felt clich #233;d and tired. It lacked the charm of the old ghostbusters and I gave up on it finally at that point. My issue could well have been I was looking for the old ghostbusters style and was closed to a newer style. I'm, after all, not the target audience for this film. Maybe if it had been made as it's own thing, without leaning on the franchise name...</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Ahhh Belong, I do love that song. Lyrically I always found it creates one of the strongest images on Out of Time. Mills increased vocal presence on the whole record was of significant benefit in my opinion and the harmonies between the 3 guys here are superb. Not my fav from the album, but not far off! One of the first bass lines I ever learnt to play properly too, inspired by the easy just 'G' bits and loved the sound of the descending riffs Mills added.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Hi! Ummmm so... Where in the world are you? Merthyr Tydfil in South Wales Are you training for anything in particular? I usually have regular events planned, have a 16 mile ([Roman Run](http://merthyr.gov.uk/media/2311/roman-run-2016-poster-en.pdf)), a half (Cardiff) and a few 10ks coming up What kind of training plan are you following? At the moment none as I'm ill... usually, I'm quite random, really need to get this part down. Are you a member of a running club? [Merthyr Running Club](http://www.merthyrrunningclub.co.uk/web/) Also tell us something about yourself. Fat-ish (not as bad as I was), asthmatic, T1 diabetic makes running interesting sometimes. Completed first Marathon this year in Manchester (4:09). Not fast over any distance but I get to the end. Link your strava account! [Ummm ok!](https://www.strava.com/athletes/11973917)</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Of all the downsides to being Diabetic (I'm T1) the one that annoys me the most is the recovery from / susceptibility to infection. My example of late relates to a small innocuous cut to my finger I didn't even notice it down the side of the nail. Then of course it got infected, to the doctors I go, antibiotics are given. It doesn't get better (it actually burst) so back to the doctor I go, more antibiotics are given. At the end of the course it's looking ok and everyone seems happy... for a week. then the finger swells back up, so back to the doctor I go and you've got the pattern by now. A simple, small cut I don't even know the cause of, 4 weeks of tablets (assuming this last lot work). 4 weeks of feeling crappy off the side effects too! Injections are fine, diet is fine, this annoys me far more.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Yeah this. I've spent time with a very social running club and (now) a more performance focused one. Both were ideal for where I was at that time. The social group got me going and got some miles in with little pressure or expectation. When I wanted to step up a bit the performance focused club have pushed me along massively and given me chances to compete where I wouldn't have before. I'd go run with one, if it's what you're looking for stay, if not no harm is done and there are always more clubs around.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Bunko is right in the article, Merthyr has moved on significantly in the last few years. But I can't help thinking it's was significant help from the EU funding the area received, which ultimately the people weren't grateful for / unaware of (there's plaques on everything) and it'll soon be gone.  #8203; I just hope the town doesn't regress back to the 'bad days' where the reputation it had now was earned.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>My feeling on this are very similar to the WTFK? remix. Yes it's nice to hear the vocals front and center, but the bits removed just make it feel a bit... I don't know exactly, but not as good. Has anything Mike played been removed yet or just Peter?</TEXT>

    <TEXT>They are grippy, but if you hold them practically at the stem I think you'd miss most of it as the colour rings aren't as grippy as the rest of it. Using them with the medium stems now and they don't feel as nice. Ordering some short ones! Don't think the wallet/out card is standard (I think I've got enough out cards anyway) for designa as these were the only ones I saw that came with it.

    <TEXT>Played online league last night and the guy was almost 20 points better than me on averages (69 V 52?). I lost 6-0 without even getting to a double, let alone having a shot at one. Thinking random mixed ability groups aren't for me, yet at least, once this season is done going to try and find a league that has divisions graded by ability. Don't mind playing better players than me, as it'll help me improve, but there was no benefit for either of us in that game.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Final resolution time! WB support eventually referred me to a manager, they've reviewed my problem and my save is corrupt. They'll set me up a new account with 3 characters from my existing save (I currently have 103) at their current level. No gear and no support cards. But they will offer me a lump sum of credits based on the money I've spent on the game, which is maybe  #163;15-20 ever. I really can't face starting all that again, so it's an au revoir from me.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Areas of Merthyr weren't designed for the volume of cars that they now have, that is for sure. Prams and wheelchairs are my issue. I know of a wheelchair user who spends half his travelling around life in the middle of the road as he can't use the pavement for more than 50 yards at a time.</TEXT>
