    <TEXT>Just something I noticed today and wanted to share. When I was not an adult and self harming, I definitely recognized that cutting did not benefit me in any way. But I continued to do it because of an addiction and routine. I recently relapsed the worst I have in years and have started burning. The issue is that I feel like it is helping. I crave the sensation when I burn myself, but also when I am burning I am able to just breathe in and out and relax. Like get actual air that isn #8217;t anxious or forced. Has anyone else experienced anything like this?</TEXT>

If I don #8217;t eat out (and even sometimes when I do), no food sounds good or like anything I want to eat. Now I have anxiety related to eating or even grocery shopping (not ED related) so I #8217;ve just associated it with the depression and anxiety.</TEXT>

You will find people who want you to change, people who  #8216;accept #8217; you but think you should remain celibate and not engage in same sex relationships, and then those who truly and wholly accept you and your sexuality. Do your research and know that there are places you and your sexuality and religion will be accepted.</TEXT>

My depression made it hard to keep up with cleaning, taking care of my spaces, and just me in general. I #8217;m excited for my new place as it #8217;s bigger and nicer. But I find myself wanting to buy all these new things in hopes of living in a cleaner space. I think in my head my belongings are just associated with filth and mess and I want a fresh start.

    <TEXT>This looks really great! I like that you can document urges and it shows your streaks on a calendar. Something else I like (that some people may disagree with),that sets it apart from other apps is that there is no  #8216;community #8217; feature or public chat sections. I know these can be helpful for some people or a place to receive and offer encouragement, but I personally find these features triggering and they weigh me down. Considering there are other apps and communities (like this) that are there for people who want to use them, I like that it is lacking in your app. I would totally download and use this app!</TEXT>
