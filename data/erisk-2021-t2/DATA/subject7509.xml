    <TEXT>Hi. I just wanted to say you're not alone, lots of us have this same anxiety and this fight inside our own heads. I recommend that you read Many lives many masters by Brian Weiss, Journey of souls and Destiny of souls by Michael Newton. Also, an interesting book I've started reading is Near death experiences: an evidence for the existence of God and Heaven by J. Steve Miller. I hope this helps :)</TEXT>

    <TITLE>As long as I have my consciousness, I have everything</TITLE>
    <DATE>2020-05-31 15:52:33</DATE>
    <TEXT>I wasn't destined to live a "normal" life. So many hardships happened, that without awakening I wouldn't have survived. But now I see it. My strength and courage comes from my consciousness, they come from me, not the ego me, but the consciousness that emanates from behind my eyes. It's beautiful to realize this because half my life I had the fear that others can hurt me, and I was really scared, deep down, but I realized this.. and boom, fear gone. Cause I know if I don't give them my attention, they can't really take anything of value away from me.</TEXT>

    <TITLE>Spirituality is not about selfishness</TITLE>
    <DATE>2020-06-10 11:00:09</DATE>
    <TEXT>I just realized something. It's not about having the shiniest spiritual ego, knowing more than others or obsessively trying to reach a certain state, it's at its core being a good person, motivated by light and kindness. It's that simple. You don't have to rush to reach enlightement in this life, we have all the time in the world. But what I see on this subreddit about people being cold and arrogant about their spiritual growth is SO not what spirituality is about. Humbleness is so important. So is kindness.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I've been thinking about this since I posted this post (about forcing kindness). But the truth is, we need to work on ourselves to be kinder and catch ourselves when we aren't being kind. I don't know if that's "forcing it", but I think that's very important. Cause sometimes we get hurt, and can lash out. Isn't it a better world if everyone is kinder, though? We need to think about other's feelings as if they were our own.</TEXT>

    <TEXT> gt;Pointing out the faults of ego in others probably is not so spiritual. Understanding where another is trying to point from is fine, but to judge is not a divine act of spirituality either. Thanks for pointing that out. If you meant that about me. Honestly you are right, it is hard to grow spiritually on Earth, and I constantly feel like I'm not seeing the whole picture and forgetting something. The more I learn about spirituality the more I realize two opposite things can be true at the same time. Like "we have all the time in the world" and "it's hard on Earth, we should hurry".</TEXT>

    <TITLE>Just some thoughts on "energy vampires"</TITLE>
    <DATE>2020-06-10 15:12:05</DATE>
    <TEXT>I see this term get thrown around alot and I'd like to share my view on it. Not everyone that you call an "energy vampire" is aware of what they're doing, or that they take away energy from surrounding people. I think people who are so called energy vampires aren't malicious most of the time (there are cases though when others suck on your energy and are completely aware of it, I'm not talking about those individuals now). They are probably depressed, beaten down and wrecked people who desperately need help. I know because I was once like that and I noticed some people would get uneasy around me and energetically, I would feel a certain rejection. This was years ago. I am asking you not to reject these individuals, but to try to offer them help, because from my experience, not just with myself but with other people too, these people have been sucked dry by life and are now trying to balance their energies by sucking energy from the environment, and unconsciously other people. Don't be so quick to judge them and reject them, because this will further their suffering.</TEXT>

    <TITLE>7s and falling in love</TITLE>
    <DATE>2020-06-13 09:01:29</DATE>
    <TEXT>I wanna hear about your experiences with craving love. I'm a sx 7 and a huge romantic. I crave love, especially when I'm not getting much satisfaction in the form of good times and fun. Over the years, I've come to realize my need for so much stimulation is because I equate getting what I want with being loved and I feel satisfied when I get what I want. I actually recently read that sentence in an enneagram book, after I've come to that realization. When life is really slow and boring my emotional cravings can get really strong and even needy. I just wanna hear about other 7s because there isn't much said on this topic in enneagram books.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>A week ago it started. I haven't been able to see a doctor because of corona. But my body feels like it's made of rocks. I'm not yet diagnosed, but I remember reading about dysautonomia before and that might explain it? I don't know. My blood pressure is fine, but I'm getting a fast heartbeat and this horrible heavy body feeling. It's so bad I can't really walk around the house or outside.

    <TEXT>I'm a sx/so 7, when I found the enneagram I knew I was a 7 instantly, because everything fit perfectly. But I've noticing lately that I have subtle qualities of enneagram 1, my stress point. Like having morals, wanting to change people for the better, being into causes, judging people for being immoral and generally I've always been pure in the sense that I didn't mean any harm to anyone. I think I read something about people having qualities of their stress and growth points. I can't remember where I read that, so I can't really check to see if that's true. What do you think?
