    <TEXT>if you look at the meme I didn't actually say anything bad about woman, all I was saying is that brie was a bad choice for marvel and needs to know her place. There are plenty of other female avengers out their and their fine. It's just Brie that has caused conflict as she is just as a whole unlikable. It says nothing bad about woman or the woman right and it's kind of ironic that all these feminists have come on to be out right toxic, only to then accuse the people of this sub of doing the same thing.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I think you have missed my point. What I was trying to say is that you should be complaining about snowflakes as a general and whether or not that snowflake happens to be white should be irrelevant. Though it is undeniable white people have done some bad things, that is no reason to marginalise that ethnic group. There is also a big misconception that you can't be racist to white people, and that caucasians are the only race who has treated another ethnic group poorly (for an example of this look up Barabary slave trade).</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Firstly, racism isn't built on white supremacy, its built on intolerance of another persons culture regardless of whether they are white, black, brown or bright pink. And secondly, I was pointing out the hypocrisy of having a subreddit aimed at creating racial equality whilst simultaneously singling out a single ethnic group. Also if I were to make a sub about another race (e.g. asian people), not only would I be creating a greater divide between races by picking on one particular one, I would also be labelled a racist for doing so. Lastly, whining and aggression is displayed by tonnes of people across the world regardless of which ethnicity they are cos at the end of the day no matter how we look on the outside, on the inside we are all pretty similar</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Ok sure, but I'm not being ignorant about anything. I haven't once denied the fact that yes in the past there have been white people that have subjugated and oppressed other races. However that is still no reason to single out the entire white population for the mistakes of certain groups of white people in the past. Especially when other races can be found guilty of doing the exact same thing. I am also not denying that systematic racism, and of course it is an issue that the entire world needs to address. I am not in anyway being ignorant. I'm sorry if you are getting frustrated, but at the same it might also be a good idea if you yourself did a bit of research into racism in the past. If you do you might discover that things aren't exactly so black and white. I'm not in anyway trying to imply that your wilfully ignorant or anything, however I'm concerned you might not entirely have the full story.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Yeah obviously some people are irrefutably evil and as this post illustrates even evil in their own time (Hitler, Stalin, Mao Sedong etc.). However when people talk about comparing people to modern day standards I think they are more referring to people such as Winston Churchill, and a bunch of US presidents. All of whom have said things that would be considered inappropriate and offensive in this day and age, but where considered totally acceptable by everyone at the time in which it was said. Imagine for example trying to explain Gender Theory to a Medievel Knight, they would think it was absolutely ludicrous, but that doesn't mean that Knight is a horrible person just confused.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>How many times does communism need to be tried and fail for people to understand that it does not work. Honestly almost every single country that has failed, and the two that haven't (namely China and Cuba) aren't that better off either. In Cuba it is cheaper to be a taxi driver than it is to be a fully fledged doctor, and in China they actually disposed of the Communist economic theory (in other words, the very basis in which communism was founded) and turned to Capitalism because it actually allowed them to earn money. They did however keep the political side of communism, because it is so easily corrupted that politicians can essentially do whatever they want, including literally declare themselves "President for life" (see china earlier). Stalinism is something different to communism, it is a product of what communist nations become, because the system relies far too heavily on the hope that people under the system will do the right thing. Also to blame the collapse of communist countries on trade is nonsense and really just grasping at straws because if you think about it, if communist countries needed the aid of America and its allies to stay a float then they were never really going to be stable were they.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Speaking of Jesus. Jesus Christ chill out. Imagine letting someone else of whom you don't know's opinion get you this fired up (or at least feel the need to express yourself as if you are). No he is not a scumbag, I use the word ignorant in the sense that people back then were a lot less educated about what was and wasn't offensive. Especially considering the world was no where near as international and diverse as it is today. Also when I pointed out that what he said was "in jest" my point was that all he was interested in was making a joke (i.e. having no terrible thoughts behind them). I'd delve deeper into why he had no hand in the deaths of Indians, but it would seem you have already been educated enough on that matter. I'm not justifying racism, I have clearly claimed saying what he did was bad, all I'm pointing out is that him saying what he did is a small mistake that pales in comparison to the enormous thing he did achieve. No he is a not a racist piece of shit by any days standards, you seem to be forgetting the fact that he said the things that he did in the same era that some people were literally committing mass genocide on the basis of peoples religion, and if people could justify that I don't see why a few rude words would be so harshly looked down upon.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>nope I will admit I was wrong and it would seem that in that instance he was not joking, I was more referring to racist jokes he made at Indians expense. However I did also say that WHAT HE SAID WAS WRONG, something that you seem to be struggling to accept considering it doesn't suit your good guy verses racist shit heap narrative in which you currently imagine yourself. Your not Nelson Mandela, and I'm not Adolf Hitler stop throwing a tantrum like a disgruntled toddler and outwardly insult someone you don't know simply because they don't share your point of view. To reiterated HE SHOULDN'T HAVE SAID WHAT HE DID, however by that same token if you had actually taken the time to even take into consideration anything I have said. You will notice that I have not said anything that indicates supporting racism, but rather attempted to point out that in spite fact he has said what he has said the man is still a hero. Yes, he said things that today would be deemed racist, but you seem to be forgetting that he said a lot of the things he did in a time before many many civil rights movements. At a time when the whole was a whole lot more ignorant and intolerant of one another, that's why these issues existed, not just because of a few people, and during this time many people did far worse things than Churchill did due to this intolerance. Yes he may have of viewed other races as lesser as a result of a lack of education and generally understanding of other cultures during the time in which he was around. But this does not mean he harboured any genuine ill intent towards these people, and unlike many others he did not act upon any of these misguided views.</TEXT>
