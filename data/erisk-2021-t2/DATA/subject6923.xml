    <TEXT>Depends on how your body heals them,and how fast(it could be months or couple of years). But the tattoo artist will decide if they can work on the skin because tattooing over scars is very hard and not an easy job. Plus depends how will they look when they are fully healed(are they gonna be white lines or remain keloid or something else,im not an expect in cuts because i dont cut myself). The best way to know is to ask a tattoo artist how they work with tattooing scars,and if they have tattooed scars (because a lot of them will probably deny working on scars because they don't want to). Sorry if the comment was rude or i made it bad. But know one thing is that you are strong and those scars are your past,even with the scars you look beautiful.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I hope you frankenstein scar heals good. Don't drag yourself down, stop calling yourself bad names and disvalue yourself. Slowly start bulding the empire you want, pick youself up, love yourself, accept the scars you have, you are more then just scars. You have alredy stepped on one of the stepping stones. You are one step forward.</TEXT>

    <TITLE>I'm sorry to disturb this subreddit, i just want to ask a question</TITLE>
    <DATE>2020-10-18 01:08:05</DATE>
    <TEXT>First of all i'm sorry to disturb and ask this question on this subreddit i do feel kinda weird doing it and i'm sorry again. I'm in a search off an Instagram girl who's account is about her struggling with cronhs for maybe 10+ years (take everything with a grain of salt my memory is not the greatest), i found out her account pop up on explore and i could never find it again. Why do i look for her account is because of i have struggles with my own stomach too but it's kind of cramps or constant pressure and i have had it for years, her page is very good to read about her going to gym, working out, diets etc etc.. Her explaining dealing thru cronhs etc.. This is the part i will ask you to take with most grain of salt, because of my memory i will try to explain how some stuff that may help you find her or you know her but is what i remember. I think she lives in NYC or somewhere in US, multiple surgery's from cronhs and has posts her holding the metal stick with IV (sorry for my english), she does have compilation of stories her getting injected with humira from her boyfriend or by herself and is with some sort of hashtag (examle #humiramondays). For her look i do not remember her at all and it will be misleading to tell you some stuff about her look. Thank you again and sorry to have asked this and disturbed this subreddit. For last, i hope every single one of you the best. Edit: I think Instagram profile verified and above 100k + followers, i don't think her account has small following.</TEXT>
