    <TEXT>Since this community is relatively small, crossposting is a pretty good way to bring some content in this sub. That way the original creator also gets enough credit. If you want to upload your own memes/ fanart or whatever feel free to do so, but you wont get as much upvotes here as on the individual subreddits from the lads</TEXT>

Thats... not why im here This is how the OC dies... with thunderous amounts of upvotes This is outrageous, its unfair! How can you upload memes, but not have them OC? This is getting out of hand! Now there are two of them! I downvoted them all, they're dead, every single one of them. And not just the reposts, but the shit posts and the OC too. They're reposts, so I downvoted them like reposts. I hate them!  #8203;  #8203;  #8203; You ever hear the tragedy of Darth Plagiarism the unwise, I though not, it #8217;s not a story the mods would tell you. It #8217;s a reddit legend. Darth plagiarism was a dark lord of reposting. So dumb and so unoriginal, he would use the sort by hot to find good posts and creat reposts. He had such low knowledge of posting he couldn #8217;t even keep the karma he loved from dying. The dark side of reposting is the path to many disabilities some considered to be unnatural. He became so weak, the only thing he was still afraid of loosing was his reposts, witch eventually of course he didn #8217;t. Unfortunately, he taught his apprentice everything he knew, then his apprentice reposted his post.
