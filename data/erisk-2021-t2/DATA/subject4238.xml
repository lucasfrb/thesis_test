    <TEXT>Hi, I #8217;m looking for a good shoe for fencing but I don #8217;t want to spend a lot of money as I #8217;m quite young and my feet are still growing. Any suggestions? My budget is preferably  #163;25 or less. Thank you! :)</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I personally think that yes the SS United States is a beautiful ocean liner. Might be a bit biased but my fascination with ocean liners started from the SS Normandie. I absolutely love that ship, luxurious Art Deco interior built in the Great Depression at a humongous cost. It #8217;s really beautiful and I find myself angry at the people managing the ship in WW2 leaving the ship in such disrepair and neglect that it caught on fire. The fact that they ignored the Normandie #8217;s Designers plan to save it. It #8217;s really sad. But I do see why people love the SS United States. It #8217;s such a big part of America #8217;s history that we can #8217;t just leave it in disrepair, abandoned and forgotten. I don #8217;t want the SS United States to suffer the same fate of the Normandie. It brings back the era of ocean liners where we could go aboard it like the RMS Queen Mary. We can #8217;t let another piece of the era of Ocean liners slip from our grasp.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>It disappeared under the waves 2 months before I was born. Never got the chance to see it. Plus I live halfway around the world and never been to the US. It #8217;s really sad to see another Ocean liner lost to time. I hope more Ocean liners get to be restored so younger people like me could get a chance to see the bygone era. The era really fascinated me, it #8217;s sad I never got to see an actual Ocean liner with my own eyes before.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>The Oyster 825 was my dream yacht! Since I was really young I was fascinated by yachts. Went to a yacht show when I was 5?ish. They had a book that they gave out. Inside the book there were many yachts I remember at that time I told myself  #8220;that #8217;s my favourite yacht #8221;. Never found out the name or seen it again until last Sunday when I was actively trying to find it here it is! And now you post this here made my day. Thank you. Btw do you like your yacht? Is it nice to live in?</TEXT>

    <TEXT>To be very very honest, it #8217;s not the restaurants fault IMO, cause they did the best they can. Some people just don #8217;t want to listen, which is a problem, that maybe people need to start thinking about others, thinking about their livelihoods. Just because you might think not social distancing is ok because the community spread remains low, doesn #8217;t mean you can intermingle and break the social distancing rules. It #8217;s really inconsiderate of people to do that.</TEXT>

    <DATE>2020-09-03 12:20:06</DATE>
    <TEXT>I #8217;m 13(M). I don #8217;t have any close friends, no one I can trust, no one who cares about me. At least that #8217;s how I feel. Before lockdown everything was fine. I had friends and stuff. But during lockdown like everyone hated me, they didn #8217;t want to talk to me neither did any of them even read my messages, yes they didn #8217;t even bother reading them. My 2 other close friends like to use their phones a lot. They never talk to me often and it always seems weird talking to them. But when they aren #8217;t using their phones they talk to each other. Yes my 2 close friends talk to each other. I #8217;m never included in the conversation, I #8217;m always just at the back, watching them talk to each other, whenever I try to pick up a conversation it feels weird. It #8217;s just like that. Idk how to explain it. It #8217;s like I don #8217;t have friends, like I #8217;m being rejected. And it #8217;s not like I #8217;m the quiet kid who says nothing at all. I talk to my classmates, like a usual person does. Yet a few or even none I could consider friends. I always sit in class, watching my classmates have fun, talk to each other. Yet here I am alone, sitting there watching them. I always felt a bit envious that they could have such good friends, I want to be like them, where school isn #8217;t such a drag cause they have friends to make it better. I always felt wrong to feel envious of them, like it #8217;s something wrong to think of. But every time, after recess, after school, everyone is talking to their friends, and here am I sitting alone. It feels like no one cares for me. No one remembers my birthday, and yet on any of my classmates birthdays they #8217;d send messages, post on their Instagram Stories, and yet here I am, doing the same to my classmates but no one ever doing it to me. I always thought, why bother, why hassle myself when no one ever cares for me. Because I want friends, I need close friends I could trust. Every time during lessons which has groupwork or it #8217;s PE, no one ever wants me in their group. Heck, I even find the quietest people in my class get a group or have someone to partner up with for PE. I #8217;m always having to ask, and though they accept, it feels like they don #8217;t want me there, like they allowed me in because they didn #8217;t want me to feel sad. But I feel bad, for causing that to others. I #8217;m always the one who walks at the back, the one who goes back home alone. The one who talks to my classmates but doesn #8217;t have any friends or close friends. The one who no one talks or thinks about. I really want help, advice to how I could have friends. Thank you for spending your time reading this</TEXT>

    <TITLE>Racism in Phantom Forces</TITLE>
    <DATE>2020-09-07 07:20:05</DATE>
    <TEXT>I hope the mods approve of this. I #8217;ve recently noticed there has been a lot of racism in phantom forces, no I #8217;m not trying to be hypocritical here. I #8217;ve seen this 2 times this week, and I only play on weekends. Sometimes it #8217;s more than 1 person, or the person has like what 6 alts so he can kick whoever he pleases. First incident, last week, Sunday I believe. Some people were talking an someone asks, is anyone else Asian here? I said yes, I am Asian. Someone else immediately says BAT! BAT SOUP CHINESE! And other ridiculous stuff like that. Insanely racist, never got kicked even though some of us tried to. Second incident, just now, like literally just now. I #8217;m not sure how it started but when I joined Person A was accusing person B for being  #8220;far left #8221; and called him a  #8220;Eurotard #8221; turns out that the person he #8217;s accusing lives in Seattle as he said so. I asked Person A,  #8220;what #8217;s wrong with being European saying a term like  #8216;Eurotard #8217;? #8221; Person A goes on saying,  #8220;They are all white privileged people. #8221; He then proceeds to try and kick me. He now thinks I #8217;m European, so I correct him saying I #8217;m Asian, and the whole bat China coronavirus thing pops up again. He even says  #8220;#IHATECHINA. I told him,  #8220;The whole Asia isn #8217;t made up of China #8221; and and he said,  #8220;India too, I don #8217;t like Indians #8221; Bruhhh. I votekicked him and out he goes. He still has one of his alts, yes alts in game which continues what he wanted to say. Calling Person B a Eurotard. Someone initiated a vote kick on person A #8217;s alt account. Before he was kicked he told Person B,  #8220;Spread your leftist ideals elsewhere #8221; I find this absolutely preposterous, what kind of twat is he?! The poor lad just wanted to play and you called him a leftist. Bruh, how does that work?! Stereotyping Asians and Europeans as well. It really effects gameplay and it #8217;s annoying. Have you experienced anything like that before?</TEXT>
