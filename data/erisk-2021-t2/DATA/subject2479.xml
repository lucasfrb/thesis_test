    <TITLE>Most of americans are dumb, face it</TITLE>
    <DATE>2019-11-28 20:36:11</DATE>
    <TEXT>OK, i don't want to offend anyone, but i think even Americans can agree that USA has some of the worlds' biggest percentage of dumb people. Take geography for example. Have you seen this video? If not, just type "name at least one country on the map". They don't even know where their county is. That would be a nonsense for every European person, but not for americans. WHY DON'T YOU USE METRIC SYSTEM OR CELSIUS? CUZ YOU WANNA LOOK COOL HUH? WELL THAT JUST MAKES YOU LOOK DUMB. Also, US is an absurdly religious country. In no other place i saw so much people angerly saying to me that evolution is a satanist theory. And i don't think that happens because of a good education system. I don't like when people force their religion down my throat. Also poor, REALLY POOR knowledge of history. I met several people that thought that the USSR started WW2. Bonus: the languages. English-speaking people in general get angry when people in other countries don't speak English, but most of them don't know other languages because "they don't need to". Don't get me started on their foreign policy. I lived in US for a year and a half. I'm russian. Make sure to write angry comments. I'm not saying all amricans are dummies, but cmon. Most of them probably are.</TEXT>
