    <TITLE>After English and Mandarin, Galician is the 3rd most useful language in the world</TITLE>
    <DATE>2020-01-13 22:12:24</DATE>
    <TEXT>In my opinion the utility of a language is measured by 1: How many people will you understand? 2: How many people will understand you? Whether your language has official status, or whether you and the person you are speaking to would refer to the same dictionary to look for the meaning of a word is irrelevant except for official purposes (but seriously, how many times have you sent a formal request to the authorities or applied for a job in your 4th language?) Galician is my native language. When I first went to school, teachers and most of my classmates spoke Spanish, a language I never heard before (nobody around me spoke it and at home we only watched TV in Galician). So you would guess I'd have trouble communicating, right? WRONG! They spoke Spanish. I spoke Galician. We understood each other perfectly. Fast-forward a few years and I got a job at a small business. One day they hired five people from other parts of Spain who had never lived in Galicia before. Some of my coworkers switched to Spanish to talk to them but I did not. I still spoke Galician. They replied to me in Spanish. We had zero trouble communicating. A few months later, I decided I wanted to learn Portuguese. I met through Skype with a Brazilian teacher. I was supposedly a beginner but when we started talking, I spoke Galician, he spoke Portuguese and guess what... We understood each other perfectly, so I changed my beginner's lesson for another one in which he taught me how to write. I was, in fact, a Portuguese iliterate. Finally, not that long, two Argentinian girls whose great-grandfather had lived in my village made a visit. And you already know how we communicated. Long sotry short, using only my native language I can comunicate with more than 800 million people (I won't include people from the south of Portugal because they are harder to understand for Galicians), which makes Galician the third most widely understood language in the world, only behind Mandarin and English</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Seriously, where did these guys study marketing? Just imagine any business doing an ad like "Hey! Did you know only 3% of people in \[insert club name\] are women? Come here and join the fun with the horde of creepy geeks you'll soon calll your friends! Also, they don't really think you can be any good at chess." Well, that's exactly what the chess community sounds like to the outside world. Every time chess makes it into the news, it's because some "famous" player said "women suck at chess", or because some journalist is discussing whether there should be female divisions or not.</TEXT>

    <TITLE>Trolls are the best part of the Internet</TITLE>
    <DATE>2020-01-17 00:57:55</DATE>
    <TEXT>Imagine some Internet warrior who takes his "cause" seriously and can rant for hours in meaningless debates with other Internet warrios like him who have nothing else to do with their time. Sure, following his posts would be boring, until... Until a troll appears! If he's ignored, at least you get a funny comment, but if the troll gets fed, that's amazing! The level of anger some people can get when being trolled is great to watch, comparable to seeing people react seriously to comments that were obviously sarcastic. A different situation could be a """model""" posting photos to seek other people's approval and attention. If all repplies are positive, then it's uninteresting. In the best case scenario, it will help some creepy people with their masturbation, and nothing else. But what could possibly be more productive than converting the photoshoot into an r/RoastMe post? Imagine a horde of creative Internet trolls finding unique ways to make fun of "the model", trampling her self-esteem so badly that she will never want to repeat the experience again. In conclusion, trolls are the reason why the Internet is funny, because what could possibly be funnier than watching conceited idiots getting annoyed for no good reason? Nothing pisses me off than "anti-troll moderation". If anything, there should be "troll-encouraging moderation", whether on Reddit, Youtube, Twitter or a random Internet blog/forum</TEXT>

    <TITLE>Your post doesn't need a TL;DR: It needs a clear, proper introductory paragraph at the beginning</TITLE>
    <DATE>2020-01-21 15:31:28</DATE>
    <TEXT>I am no fan of TL;DRs in long Reddit posts (or in any other sort of text). Your first paragraph should cover their function by including a summary of your main points. Reserve the details for later on, once the reader has already decided whether the post will be worth reading or not. Many long Reddit posts start by providing context, which sometimes goes on for thousands of words without saying any relevant thing until almost the end of the post, where conclusions are reached. If we were writing a story, that would be a good technique. As we don't want to make spoilers, the conclusion clearly belongs at the end. However what happens most often in an argumentative text (like most posts in this sub) is that people will scan the title and the first few lines, realize the text is long, look for a TL;DR at the bottom (which more often than not is just a reiteration of the title), then read it and go back to the top. That's an unnecessary nuissance and may lead to the reader stopping to read.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>It's impossible to find any official F1 content in languages other than English. I understand English is enough to reach a lot of people but come on! We've included speeds in MPH which only 5% of the world uses. I bet you more than 5% of the world's population doesn't speak English. Sure, Liberty have never heard complaints like these because they aren't in English but F1 has practically disappeared from countries like Spain. F1 content in other broadly spoken languages like Arabic, Mandarin, Russian, Spanish or Portuguese would be greatly appreciated by a lot of fans. A lot of people can be reached. **EDIT**: To clarify, I am not asking for something like an interview with Vettel in Mongolian, but how is it that [formula1.com](https://formula1.com) is only available in one language? It's not that hard to do. Also, if F1 publishes an interview with, say, Ocon, French captions would be great. It's not that hard to do. It certainly costs much less than many of the useless graphics they've added recently</TEXT>

    <TITLE>"Parking lot fighter"</TITLE>
    <DATE>2020-01-23 11:58:58</DATE>
    <TEXT>Here's a game I'd absolutely love to play: A bunch of players (as many as possible without worsening the quality) are put into some stage (say, a mall, a parking lot, a school, a bar a park, whatever... Different stages could offer different gameplay). The objective is to be the last one standing in a realistic fight (that players view from a first-person perspective). It should feel like an actual fight, so no healthbar like most fighting games. Instead, you go for a KO or a submission. In order to prevent some players from just avoiding conflict until only a few opponents are left, a bonus could be awarded per every elimination (or perhaps, if a player reaches X eliminations he is automatically declared the winner, regardless of how many remain). This idea is of course online-oriented, but may be interesting to adapt into a single-player. It'd be great to have a wide variety of (customizable? characters), maybe even put your own picture (that's hard stuff, I know) into their faces. Some may see this idea as a "shooter with no weapons", but I think the game mechanics will be completely different (1-vs-1 conforntations will not be solved instantly and other players could join in)</TEXT>

    <TITLE>Tekken games are 2D</TITLE>
    <DATE>2020-01-27 22:36:51</DATE>
    <TEXT>Many fans of fighting games would say that Tekken is different from other franchises like Mortal Kombat because Tekken is 3D while Mortal Kombat is 2D. But the meaning of "3D" here is confusing. They will argue that mechanics like the side-stepping are what account for the difference. OK, maybe they are technically right. The third dimension plays some role. But have a look at the Smackdown VS Raw games. how many dimensions do you see there? Three, right? You can freely move around in any direction you want. You have all 360 #186; easily available to you by just moving your joystick around. What do we have in Tekken? Forward, backwards and side-stepping! Definitely not the same freedom (what are dimensions apart from "degrees of freedom" after all?) What's worse: side-stepping is not even a basic mechanic of the game. You can play the game just fine without even knowing it exists. Give a try to SvR moving only forwards and backwards and compare the result. In short, Tekken claiming to be "3D" is just false advertising. Nobody apart from a hardcore fan of fighting games (or someone who heard it from a hardcore fan) would ever call a game like Tekken "3D"</TEXT>

    <TITLE>The StackExchange moderation system is better than the Reddit one</TITLE>
    <DATE>2020-01-28 13:20:55</DATE>
    <TEXT>It's common to see some people (normally beginners) complain about how their questions on StackOverflow (or any of the related sites) is closed due to breaking the rules. But I think the moderation in those communities works better than on Reddit. Let me elaborate: First, the community does not "belong" to the moderators. There are periodically held elections. If the users don't like some of the mods, then they only have to wait until the next one and get rid of them. More importantly, most of the moderation tasks are done by the community. A decision to close (or put "on hold") a question can be reverted by the users even when it's taken by a moderator. Sure, there's the possibility of completely deleting a question, but that's only used on a few occasions to get rid of spam. Finally, there is a fixed number of reasons why a question can be closed, and those are the same for every Stack Exchange community. The only one that is site-dependent is the "no off-topic questions" rule, but the scope of the site is always clearly defined. When in doubt, a Meta post will be opened to discuss whether the post was indeed off-topic. In short, the Stack Exchange communities are way more effective than subreddits at 1: Getting rid of everything that shouldn't be there. 2: Haven't a fair moderation system with little-to-no "false positives"</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Understanding theft is a general sense as "ceasing property away from its legitimate owner", then sure. Taxation is indeed theft. But there is a big difference between that and say, pickpocketing or bank robbing, isn't it? Since many of you are from the United States, I'll put an example you will relate more to. Let's go back to the early days of your country, a few decades after its foundation. We'll focus on southern rural areas. What do you see? Plantations! Who works on those plantations? Who runs them? Would you call the workers "victims of theft"? My point is that, when people are forced to give away a part of the products of their work that can be as big as the "thief" decides, that's not ordinary theft. That's slavery. Taxation is slavery</TEXT>

    <TEXT>That's what many people are now saying, so.... Let me make a quick review of the facts in case you got tricked: The Communist Party of China covers up the existence of a new devastating virus in order to avoid looking bad. It locks the scientist who found it in prison (No. Not a privately run prison). Governments all over the world are unable to take the problem seriously and react on time. They encouraged people to participate in pro-government demonstrations. Public health systems all over the world are collapsing and refusing to treat you if you are too old. National governments can't manage to get their hands on necessary equipement. But somehow, it's the fault of greedy neoliberal Capitalism</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Movies, series and even books often show a distorded version of reality. Sometimes they even turn their "mistake" into a stereotype that is taken as true by the general public. From the top of my head: \- There is an inverse correlation between logical-mathematical and emotional intelligence. \- Strong people are slower. \- Highly intelligent people are expected to know a lot about fields completely unrelated to theirs. \- People who are good at programming are automatically good at breaking IT security. \- People who train martial art forms can beat a gang of a dozen armed people. Among these and any others you can think of, which is the most absurd recurrent "fact" in fiction that has nothing to do with how things actually are?

    <TITLE>Awful chess-inspired advice</TITLE>
    <DATE>2020-05-10 15:41:15</DATE>
    <TEXT>Every now and then my eyes or ears get annoyed by some lame chess-related quote thtat someone who thinks he's "wise" and "knowledgeable" shares with me. Those often try to sound smart (that's why they mix chess into it, despite probably not even knowing how to set the pieces properly) and they also try to carry some "deep meaning". One I particularly like to hate is "Life is like chess. A bad move at any time can cost you your queen". Let's mock those "philosophers of life" for a while and try to find ideas in chess that, taken as a metaphore for real life, would constitute an awful piece of advice. Here's my idea:  gt;Don't hesitate to put the lives of your wife and friends at risk in order to achieve your goals. What can you come up with?</TEXT>

    <TITLE>If you are a new fan, it's your lucky day!</TITLE>
    <DATE>2020-05-17 11:44:54</DATE>
    <TEXT>I am going to introduce you into the most exciting month of your life. Let's start with some context: We are not currently confined during a pandemic. You are not reading any "news" on Twitter and Facebook is something you never heard of because it's just for nerds. The current Ricciardo-Sainz-Vettel love triangle does not exist. You've never heard of anyone called Ricciardo, Vettel is an overhyped kid a lot of people is talking about who will never achieve anything serious if he even makes it to F1. As far as your knowledge goes, Carlos Sainz is a retired rally driver.  #8203; As you may have guessed, we are on the 16th of March 2007. A new F1 season is starting today. Fernando Alonso, the reigning world champion is starting a new stage of his career by joining McLaren (yeah, it's a good team, it doesn't have a GP2 engine, but a Mercedes). This young Spaniard dethroned Michael Schumacher, who is now retired from F1 forever (with no chance of ever being a comeback). McLaren will partner Alonso with a rookie by the name of Lewis Hamilton, of whom I never heard of because nobody watches GP2. McLaren's former driver Kimi Raikkonen will occupy the Kaiser's seat at Ferrari, alongside Felipe Massa. As you already know, Ferrari is a team that is always either winning the title or fighting closely for it, so don't miss on what these two can do. On the other hand, current back-to-back title winners, Renault will try to deal with Alonso's departure in the best possible way. This may be the season where Giancarlo Fisichella shows what he's capable of. Former GP2 driver Heikki Kovalainen (yes, another Finn) will be his teammate. So, these are expected to be the main title contenders for this year's title, but don't miss on Honda, who has a solid driver lineup (Button and Barrichello). This could be the year where they finally step up. There's also Toyota and BMW-Sauber making a large investment. Who knows, it could start to pay off! By the way, don't be scared. Indeed, all of the teams mentioned so far has a different engine supplier. There's nothing inherently wrong with that. Alright, so now what you are gonna do is stop looking at any F1 statistics, or highlights/reviews from the period 2007-2019 or anything like that. What you are going to do is visitting [the full calendar of the 2007 season, with no spoilers included](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2007_Formula_One_World_Championship#Season_calendar) and watch every race in order (by any means necessary) with the tension of not knowing what's going to happen. Some may argue that this is not the best season ever, and they are right (2003, 2012...). But I've chosen the 2007 season because then you can also watch [2008](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2008_Formula_One_World_Championship#Season_calendar), [2009](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2009_Formula_One_World_Championship#Season_calendar) and [2010](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2010_Formula_One_World_Championship#Season_calendar), which were all great. Enjoy! Yes, pitstops did last 8-10 seconds. It's not that the mechanics suck, it's that you have to refuel the car. Also, that was an overcut. Cars are faster before a pitstop than after it. And no, we don't need a safety car after than incident</TEXT>

    <TITLE>Where's the peak of the Laffer Curve?</TITLE>
    <DATE>2020-06-08 09:37:36</DATE>
    <TEXT>**WARNING:** Please note that this question is very different from "What tax rate would you consider ideal?". Indeed, the further right you are on the compass, the more different it is. This debate might be slightly off-topic here, but I've found r/Politicalompass to be one of the few suitable places for discussion on Reddit **EXPLANATION FOR NOOBS:** The Laffer Curve is a very simple mathematical model created to illustrate while increasing tax rates does not always increase total tax revenue. Let's say we live in country X where a flat tax on income is the only source of revenue for the government: If country X set tax rates at 0%, then the government would obviously collect $0 every year. Similarly, if tax rates were set at 100%, then working would be completely pointless and the government would still get something very close to $0 at the end of the year. But if tax rates were at 1%, 10%, 30% or 70%, it's obvious that the government would collect some money. What the Laffer Curve model proposes is that there must be a sweet spot somewhere between 0% and 100% where the total amount of money the government collects is maximized (in other words, if the government change that ideal tax rate, its total revenue would decrease, whether they are increasing or decreasing such tax rate). There have been "studies" trying to find where that sweet spot is, but what I've seen is that they mostly reflect the author's political beliefs rather than any actual economical facts. So it's time for you to make a guess, when does more become less? [View Poll](https://www.reddit.com/poll/gyw9g5)</TEXT>

I have no problem playing those lines and I often get an advatange pretty quickly as black. I also know some theory on the King's Gambit. However, every time my opponent plays 2.Ke2, I don't know what to do anymore. I can't find any material about this line anywhere and all I know is that Lichess calls it the Smorodinski-Poliaschenov attack. I've tried 2...Ba3 because it puts some pressure on the opponent's queenside but somehow I often fail to equalize. Can you recommend me any books that study this line in depth?

    <TEXT>I've recently come across [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTy4Es7vlaI) and I'd like to know what song is played from 3:32 to 4:35. I tried to get some of the lyrics and Google them but I failed (I'm not a native English speaker, so I probably misheard them) The video was uploaded to youtube in 2009 so it's definitely not from the last decade (I think the original documentary is from the mid 2000s)</TEXT>

    <TITLE>Let's improve the Stack Exchange Chess community!</TITLE>
    <DATE>2020-07-03 06:43:09</DATE>
    <TEXT>Hi all! I don't know if you are familiar with the Stack Exchange sites, but there is one for chess! A Stack Exchange site is a Q amp;A forum that stores a great amount of knowledge. Even if your question has never been asked before, you'll often get an aswer within hours. And yet, [chess.stackexchange.com](https://chess.stackexchange.com) is not that great of a site for chess players. First the positives: it is well moderated (most of the moderation process is done by the community rather than a tiranical mod, and when you get bans, you get them for an actual reason, unlike most subreddit). If you ask an interesting question about chess, you often get a decent answer fast enough. So what's the problem, then? Well, just look at the recently asked questions! Most of them are about engines, weird variants of the game, potential holes in the rulebook and random combinatorics curiosities. All of these things are great but they give the impression to not be very useful for the average chess player. I'd invite you to join the site and use it for "actual" chess questions!</TEXT>

    <TEXT>First of all, lichess good, [chess.com](https://chess.com) bad. Engines are Gods. Thou shalt not criticize engines. Checking all of your games with the engine offered by lichess is the only way to improve. You should also learn as many technical details about engines as possible and make posts about them. The chess community is very toxic. Almost everyone here is a racist misogynist who predates children. Except for me and my buddies, of course, we are nice guys. Being a chess streamer is the equivalent of being the world champion. All streamers play at God-level. 4-hour streams are very fun and instructive to watch. Here's my first smothered mate. White to move and win. I'll tag it as advanced even though any 1500-rated player can solve it in five seconds. USCF rating. Lichess rating. FIDE? What's that? Metric system or something? Nakamura is the best player who has ever existed. The London System is very boring. I play the English opening Openings won't make anything to improve your game.

    <TITLE>As a long-time fan of the series, here's why Gran Turismo Sport campaign sucks</TITLE>
    <DATE>2020-07-31 10:32:12</DATE>
    <TEXT>I've played Gran Turismo since I can remember. I was maybe around 5 when I took a PS1 controller on my hands for the first time, with the first Gran Turismo running on the console. I sucked at it so it took me a lot time to complete the game (I played other things too, of course, but GT remained my favourite game). Then came GT2 (Wow! So many cars! Great improvement!), GT3 (WOW! This looks awesome! It's almost like driving an actual car!) and GT4 (just speechless!), which was the last GT game I owned. I played GT5 and GT6 but only occassionally. I've spent my holidays on my brother's house and... kis hids had just discovered GT Sport!! So I've had a great experience of swimming in the river, walking through the forest, riding bikes, and some controller sharing in GT Sport campagin mode. Here's why I think campaign mode doesn't work as it should in GT Sport (I had seen videos before, but this was hte first time I had a chance to play): \- **Who designed the events?:** Just take a quick look at the event list. It looks like they were made by a random number generator! The only variety is on the cars that take place. If you were looking for something like a championship rather than single race, I guess it sucks for you! \-**No variety in race length:** this is basically a return to the PS1 times. For example in GT3 you had races that took 2 minutes, 5, 10, 15, 20, 30, 40... and then the endurance races! All races on GT Sport are about the same length. Why? \- **No damage. No tire degradation:** another thing I don't understand. I get you may not want to have those in the beginner events, but there's a group of races called "Professional League" and all we get there are arcade-ish races? These things are \- **The AI is too easy:** there is no challenge at all. The only difficulty comes from the game putting you half a minute behind the leader at the start. How about tougher opponents and a chance to qualify? Just like in real life, why not imitate that? That's what I'd expect from a "simulator". If there's no damage, there's also no reason not to have grid starts! (Once again, the problem comes from very little thought put into it) \- **The progression is also too easy:** no matter how bad you are at the game, you'll always have a mountain of cash. As you don't even have licenses, you can go at any event and win with ease. Of course you can join with a worse car than possible, but this only means that in order to enjoy the game you have to play as if you weren't even trying! You don't even have to spend money to improve your car, which makes everything even easier! Not to mention the free cars you get for not much more than breathing. What makes me sad is that making a "campagin mode" that works is not htat hard. It's been done before! I understand the main focus of GT Sport is online racing, but once you introduce a campaign mode, does it really takes a big amount of extra work to do it right? **EDIT:** Gotta love how the "EsPoRtS" nerds are acting as if I had just murdered the few friends they have. Come on! I'm not trying to take anything from you! You can keep playing online lmao. Why does the conversation always go like? \- Hey! Here is a list of reasons why campaign sucks. Like, the AI is bad, there's no real variety and the events are not well thought \- WTF are you doing? Man, don't you see that nobody cares about campaign? Online is the only thing that matters. You have to be mentally retarded to play campaign! Take 100 downvotes! \- OK, why wouldn't you play campaign, then? \- Because it sucks! The AI is bad, there's no real variety and the events are not well thought!</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Hi everyone! I'm having a little bit of trouble trying to rearrange the order of the games in my database.

If I rearrange the games, they will set themselves back to how they used to be after I close. Any help? Thank you!</TEXT>

    <TITLE>Traditional family is not traditional at all</TITLE>
    <DATE>2020-08-25 22:04:33</DATE>
    <TEXT>This may depend on the part of the world you are in but at least where I'm from people often refer to "traditional family" as a husband and a wife who haven't been marreid to anyone else before, plus one or more of their biological kids living in the same place and not sharing it with anyone else. Well, I don't understand how this is breaking news for so many but that type of arrganement is a few generations old at most. Multigenerational households have been the norm almost everywhere for most of human history. Staying at your parents' house was not seen as "immature". Quite the opposite, you were supposed to stay and care for them and they cared for you when you were young. Sometimes several siblings stayed and you had cousins being raised under the same roof. Sometimes even neighbours joined the party! For example, my grandparents' house used to be split between two unrelated families, with the kitchen being shared. There were cases where other people were taken in for long periods of time if they had some work in common to do. In short, the idea of a "traditional family" has only been around for the time people have lived in cities. There's nothing traditional about it.</TEXT>

    <DATE>2020-08-31 09:58:37</DATE>
    <TEXT>In several discussions with Socialists I've often seen the argument that I should not fear about my property because all Socialists want is that I don't own any means of production. As long as it's not a means of production, then my stuff stays with me... However, when I think about it, everything I have around is potentially a means of production. Here I have my laptop which can of course produce many things. I also have some food which I could to offer some customers a meal (or even better, hire someone else to do it and get my beautiful surplus). Something similar for my bed. There's some paper around that I could use to write a best-seller and become a millionaire. My hammer and screwdrivers are the ultimate means of production. With my decks of cards, it'd be easy to start some sort of gambling place, with my chess board, I can start a business dedicated to chess lessons. I guess when socialism arrives all of that stuff will have to be taken away from me or at least some heavy restrictions on its usage will have to be implemented. Am I falling into some misunderstanding here?</TEXT>

    <TITLE>The reason kids spend their days in front of a screen is because you've fucked up all alternative forms of entertainment</TITLE>
    <DATE>2020-09-01 17:21:23</DATE>
    <TEXT>People often tend to blame the technology itself when complaining about "kids these days" spending all their time with their phones, consoles, and so on. But I don't think videogames and Youtube are something like the ultimate form of entertainment. They're great and I love them, sure, but I don't think they're that addictive or "special" to get all of a kid's interest by themselves (after all, kids get bored by everything really soon, don't they?) Let's look at alternative, more "traditional" forms of entertainment. I'm only 28 and I can already see how much they've changed. I used to ride my bike all day long since I was 6 or 7 years old, now it's too dangerous for some reason and many kids will only be allowed to do it while the parents are watching. Same for going to the pool or river for a swim. Feel like playing some football? Well, a drop of rain fell two hours ago so no way! Even just for going to the park! There used to be almost no parents there unless their oldest kid was something like 5 years old. Now there are more parents that children! And there's yet another problem. In some areas, there are just no other children around perhaps in dozens of kilometres! The most drastic example: I used to have play fights with my siblings, cousins, friends and classmates all the time, sometimes even in front of my parents! Sometimes even the parents were cheering!! I'm not saying that's necessarely a good thing, but it's unthinkable only a couple of decades later. And don't even get me started on fighting in the water (which I've probably done like a million times)! But these are just examples... I have a few reasons to believe I'm right about this "helicopter-parenting" being the reason behind kids loving their phones so much: \- First, in an era of videogames with graphics and playability that we wouldn't even dream of not that long ago, you'd expect things like chess to be almost disappearing. Well, chess is stronger than eve. Whether in my town, my country or my planet, the number of kids playing chess tournaments does not stop to grow. \- Also, at least in my experience, this trend had started way before things like social media were mainstream. Already by the time I was 12 or so I noticed kids younger than me spent a lot of time watching TV (and I wasn't the only one) \- And finally, just compare different types of parents, the rules they put, and what their children do. Think of those two annoying bored kids in a family dinner. If parents force them to stay at the table give them a tablet, they'll be on the tablet, but what if they are allowed to leave? **NOTE:** The points I'm making here are strongly region-dependent and may not apply to your particular country or society. I'll use my own as a reference and if the situation in yours is wildly different, I'd love to hear about that contrast in the comments. **ANOTHER NOTE**: I wanted the title to say "we've fucked up" rather than "you've". I was going to copy/paste, rewrite the title and post again but there were already some comments so I'll leave it as it is so you can see that I'm dumb</TEXT>

    <TITLE>[Socialists] Which is the maximum exploitation rate below which a revolution would no longer we worth it?</TITLE>
    <DATE>2020-09-02 13:57:17</DATE>
    <TEXT>As we all know, the central idea of Socialism is replacing the capitalist system, where private ownership of the means of production leads to exploitation of the worker, with an alternative system where that exploitation does not occur. The value extracted by the owner of the means of production (or "capitalist" for short) is referred to as surplus. The "**exploitation rate**" is defined as the surplus divided by the total value of the worker's labor. For example, if the capitalist pays only $100 to the worker that generates a total value of $400, the exploitation rate would be at 75%. So, as mentioned above, Socialism intends to replace this system for one where exploitation rate is 0%, but history has taught us that the transition is difficult, with a revolutionary process potentially degenerating into a dictatorial regime which keeps exploiting the workers, a civil war, a faillure and violent return to the old order, or other undesirable outcomes. So my question for you is. Is there an exploitation rate so low that, while you still consider exploitation immoral, you'd think the risks that come with a revolution are just not worth taking anymore?</TEXT>

    <DATE>2020-09-03 09:47:50</DATE>
    <TEXT>References are often taken as a good measure of the soundness of a scientific publications. A solid paper should be based on various sources of previous work, so that the result makes sense inside other findings on a given field. However, the conclusions of studies are often obtained without taking almost any of those references into account, which appear for several reasons, such as: \- Providing context \- Further information for the reader on a certain related topic. \- As a bad practice, increasing the number of citations an author has, or simply adding references for the sake of it, making it seem like the work is better researched than it actually is. Results would probably have been the same if the authors had never heard of the papers they're citing. While it is true that some of those could have been the initial inspiration for the researcher, what's more common is that they only found most of those once they started their project.</TEXT>

So yeah it's perfectly fine to tell them that I'm busy and that they should go fuck themselves and get a real job.</TEXT>

    <TITLE>Does Cobra Kai rely on Karate Kid way too much?</TITLE>
    <DATE>2020-09-14 14:53:17</DATE>
    <TEXT>It's obvious that since Cobra Kai is a Karate Kid sequel, a lot of elements from those movies will appear again. However, don't you think that in season 2 it looked as if they were trying to bring as many things from the original movies as possible? I'm all for references to the original movies but I think Cobra Kai is a legitimate show in its own right.</TEXT>

    <TITLE>In combat sports, bigger and stronger training partners are much safer than smaller and weaker ones.</TITLE>
    <DATE>2020-09-15 11:19:22</DATE>
    <TEXT>Almost every time someone new joins a BJJ or boxing class, they'll try to be paired with a small guy it they can (and the coach allows it). Well, that's a wrong decision. Big, strong guys are aware of their strength and the "danger" they can cause, so they are used to controlling their power. They'll go just hard enough so the sparring/rolling is an enjoyable experience and both parts can use it as a valuable training exercise. On the other hand, smaller and weaker people (specially when they don't have much training) will often go as hard as they can from second 1, and that's when injuries can happen. Of course this is just a generalization and doesn't apply to everyone. There are big rude people and small nice people. But this tendency does exist and you should be aware of it.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I just bought F1 2012 on Steam to remember one of the most exciting seasons we've ever experienced. The game is great for its time and you can buy it for peanuts so it's totally worth it. But there's one thing that bothers me: the game REALLY hates Lotus and Kimi in particular. They should be close to having the fastest car on the grid and yet they're the sixth strongest team at best. I can't imagine what kind of things the Finn could have done to the game developpers (maybe he ace their ice creams), but it just doesn't feel right. Are there any mods that correct this?</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I've been using Tinder for several months. Not too actively, enough to get a few matches here and there, but nothing special. Then the "go global" option appeared and for a few days already I'm getting a match with every single Brazilian girl I swipe right! They don't seem to be fake accounts or anything and I've had some conversations that look nothing like scams. So my question: do you know of how the "go global" function works? Is there anything that makes matches more likely? Or is it just that I'm some sort of a one-country specialist? Should I buy a one-way ticket to Rio?</TEXT>

    <TITLE>Does the "drivers must use two different compounds" rule make races worse?</TITLE>
    <DATE>2020-10-01 08:45:01</DATE>
    <TEXT>At the time it was introduced, the intention of the rule was to add more strategical variety to races. However, more than a decade later I think the rule is achieving the exact opposite: Almost every race after mid-2013 has been a one-stop race (or at least that's what most teams intended). This is basically reducing strategic options to S-M (Soft-Medium), S-H and M-H strategies, with a single pitstop ideally happening a bit before half-distance. Some drivers with nothing lo lose occasionally start on the hard tyre hoping for a safety car to appear at the right time, or at least being able to choose correctly between soft or medium for their last stint when most information is already "known". Since drivers who take part in Q3 must start the race with the tyre they used for their Q2 time, H-S and H-M strategies are never an option for drivers with intentions to win or finish in the podium. Also, making the first lap on tyres harder than everyone else's is far from optimal. Now let's see what happens if the two-compound rule is scrapped: H-H is still not a good option for the same reasons as H-S and H-M. One could say that we'd see S-S strategies way too often, but if that were the case nothing would change: if a race can be completed with S-S, then all current rules will do is change it into S-M, so in any case we're making strategies more homogeneous (without the rule, some could still try S-M anyway and hope for high degradation to occur). So, the only new strategy that could "ruin" races is M-M, but this needs drivers to take the risk to make Q2 on the medium tyre, thus we won't see everybody using the same strategy when M-M is viable. Finally (and most importantly), current rules ban the most logical alternative to one stopping, which would obviously be S-S-S in most tracks. Allowing S-S-S strategies would also give drivers the chance to get the most out of their tyres rather than managing them, as they'll have more options available in case they get high degradation early in the race. So these are my thoughts, but I'd like to see yours. What arguments would you find to keep the rules as they are? Would this have to little of an impact to be worth caring about?</TEXT>

    <TEXT>There is a well known tendency among students pretty much anywhere in the world to "learn" a subject only to pass a test, probably forgetting most of what's been memorized in the following days, never to be remembered again. This is particularly true in subject such as Literature or History, but the sciences are not far behind, the only difference that it's memorization of an "algorythm" or "recipe", rather than a list of facts. I'd like to collect experiences from all over the world as to what the situation in the country you're in looks like. How important was pure memorization in your schooling? Was there any concern for global understanding of the subject, rather than having tests as the only target?</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Very good question. The answer can't be that good though as it changes all the time. 20 years ago you'd have been put in a mental institution if you cliamed that Caro-Kann was used to fight for a win (when your opponent just wants a draw) instead of the Sicilian. However, as time has gone by and deeper analysis of each opening was made, many of the formerly considered "sharp openings" turned out to be forced draws if both sides played correctly, with no real viable alternatives for either player. On "quieter" positions like those from Caro-Kann, there are more options to keep the game complicated.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Common knowledge says the bishop is slightly superior, but acting on this principle without further detail would make your play worse. You need to understand the particularities of each psoition. For instance, bishops often get disturbed by friendly pawns blocked on squares of their color. A knight will often be better than a fellow bishop at defeating one of these "bad bishops". If you have some chess buddies, I'd suggest you to play some bishop vs knight endgames with different pawn structures. If you don't, a powered-down chess engine can do the job. Don't miss the chance to analyze your own bishop vs knight games. Counting the number of squares they control is a decent approximation (and it would favor the bishop in most situations), but we often care more about controlling **important** squares rather than just the raw number. **EDIT:** All knights are made equal but bishops are light-squared or dark-squared. There are a lot of positions, specially endgames where a knight is stronger than one of the bishops but weaker than the other. I'd try to evaluate each position with the strength of knigts against each of the two bishops (or whichever bishop is still on the board) rather than against "bishops" in an abstract way.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Math is essential to the modern world (just as the other subjects you mention), but there are definitely more effective ways to learn Math than attending a school where they teach you mechanized methods to solve a pre-established set of problems. Of course you'll learn some things at school. By the time you've turned 16, you've spent 10,000+ hours in it, so not all of that time will definitely wasted, but that's not saying much. I think there are more efficient uses of 10,000 hours than "barely avoid to waste all of them"</TEXT>

    <TEXT>We need simpler engines. The hybrid era has not managed to give a "greener image" to the sport. It just made engine design more complicated and expensive. A team like Aston Martin could try to build their own power unit if it was a conventional V8/V10, but how on Earth are they going to even try to make one of these monsters?</TEXT>

    <TEXT>A F1 precisa de motores mais simples. Uma equipa como a Aston Martin ou mesmo a McLaren poderia tentar fazer a sua pr #243;pria unidade de poten #231;a se for um V8 ou V10 tradicional.

    <TEXT>Even more recently, in 2009, we had Ferrari, Mercedes, BMW, Renault, Cosworth, Toyota and Honda. The cost had raised but it was nowhere near the current one. Maybe going back to the 80's/early 90's ecosystem would be too extreme but why can't we have something like we had one decade ago?</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Hi everyone! I've recently bought a laptop with a AMD Radeon Vega 8 graphic card. I've checked minimal requirements for some games and they suggest a NVIDIA GT 640 / AMD HD 7750 (DirectX11 **Graphics Card**). How do those compare? Will my device be enough to run properly?</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Speculation only happens because building new houses is almost impossible without bribing someone. That's why luxury stuff is preferred, because once you've gone through all the bureaucratic nightmare, the only way to make the investment worth it is to sell a product with high added value. Something like [this](https://www.curbed.com/2017/10/5/16432426/shipping-container-house-amazon-for-sale) would never be allowed in Spain All of that creates a great spot for speculation as supply is artificially shortened</TEXT>
