    <TEXT>It may not be popular opinion from what I've seen, But I would actually prefer this sort of menu. When I first booted up the game I liked how simple the UI was, but saw how it got boring to look at. After seeing this, it showed me how cool this would have been. This feels like it would fit halo 5 to me. But then again we bought this game to actually play it than stare at the menu all day right?</TEXT>

    <TEXT>My hopes is that they continue the infinite warfare story; at least with one more entry. It really caught my attention and I love the art design of the characters and ships. The story is what sold the game for me. Also, if they do what they did last time, and have a modern warfare remaster with it and it would be great! Two great stories and a hopefully good multiplayer is what I #8217;ll be hoping for!!</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I was a Job Corps student, which was a way for me to get a job and a high school diploma at the time. They would have you stay in dorms, follow a daily routine on schedules they made up for you. my campus was in the Black Hills National Forest with no internet or way to use a cell phone to call home. I lived pretty far away from campus, so I had to travel nearly 4-5 hours if I had to see home, and only when I was allowed by the campus staff. Coming to a place like that was a first for me, and pretty much the first time I left home in my life. But I was there for 2 years, rarely seeing or hearing from everyone I knew. With me going home being so rare. I missed out on a lot, my sister coming home from college for Christmas, My dad being sick and eventually passing away, and Pretty much most major game and or movie release. It #8217;s a beautiful campus for Job Corps, but the people were not always tolerable or the most hygienic. You had to deal with grown adults who argued to not clean up or let alone shower. Staff chose favorites, a lot people just wanted to leave, because others made it harder for the people who needed this education and help. I #8217;m glad it was something I completed, but I #8217;m also glad that I have control over my life again.</TEXT>

He would show up drunk and make things awkward and annoying. Say inappropriate things directed to my sister and sometimes my mom. He also wasn #8217;t invited to the family event, he never is. He still preys for her at the bars whenever she comes home from college. I also found out recently that my distant family members on my adoptive side, think I #8217;m just like him. So I now look bad as well at other family events, just for being blood related to him.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I do like this game a lot, but to me it just feel like the aiming is still off. In the settings for the controller I use preset 4 for aiming, but looking in some directions is slower unless you are looking completely vertical or horizontally. Lastly even with the sensitivity all the way up it still feels sluggish. Regardless of all that I completed the game and enjoyed the graphics and story, can #8217;t wait for more. I just hope the aiming and looking gets better.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>From what I can tell, they fixed it to where you aim slightly easier In aiming preset 4. But only when looking vertically and horizontally. Anything in between that is still slow, while the overall sensitivity is still sluggish even when set to max. There is definitely room for improvement. But beating or playing the game isn #8217;t impossible, it #8217;s just difficult for some to work with sometimes; Especially if you are being swarmed by a group of mutants. Hopefully they make to where aiming is more natural.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>If I had to be honest, the multiplayer is the weakest part of the game. I find the gameplay fun and it looks great too! But everything from the progression, how you get skins, and even new challenges is a total drag. The skins I wanted were playable in the campaign too! They are literally in the game, would have been nice to earn them for multiplayer by completing the chapters they were in but, you know....money?</TEXT>
