    <TEXT>so ive been trying to get back into monster hunter gen \* for 3ds\* , I used to be on the amino . I do like the game but i wanted to know if these things happen to other players . I understand trolling and i'm fine with it but this is .. not trolling . I have been sexually harrased and cussed out and for some reason social isolated . things that should not be said to actual decent people where said to me . I by no means blame the community but these players seem mental . though i want to know if anyone has experinced this and if i should post updates ?</TEXT>
