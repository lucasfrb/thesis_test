    <TEXT>I would be really worried about the long term effects of breathing in that much glitter at once. I mean, these people will probably take hours to get it off of their body, and no one knows if this stuff isn't cancerogen when inhaled. Pretty messed up thing to do.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>These are Trichocereus taquimbalensis. Trichocereus terscheckii has different spines. Trichocereus werdermannianus has similar spines, but only because it's heavily influenced by Trichocereus taquimbalensis as well.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Sounds like a great mix for sowing out, but I wouldn't use it for larger plants. Pumice and Lava are perfect for cactus soil and I use them as main ingredients in my soil. They work so good you could use them without adding in anything else. Personally, I do mix a bit of Coir into the mix to improve the soil's ability to store water and make it more compact, but I wouldn't use more than 10-15%. There are cacti who don't mind having wet feet, but the more Coir you put in the longer it takes for it to dry. That said, I've seen people having great results with Coir as main medium, if the climate supports it. It's much safer to use minerals like Pumice though.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Really depends on the genus, or species. This one here lasted one day, and this evening it started closing again. Very possible that it will reopen again late at night. These are normally pollinated by bats and moths, so it's important that they are only open when the pollinators are active. Some only stay open a few hours. It's a desirable trait when they stay open for various days.</TEXT>

You know, you don't really make a lot of money from it, but the fact that I can finally live my dream and create my own cactus hybrids is very well worth it. Took me lots of time and work to have a setup that works with my climate and I'm very happy I stuck with it through the difficult times.

    <TEXT>The original Terminator movies were the most favorite franchise of my childhood and scared the living hell out of me. Though I personally enjoyed parts of every sequel, I'm really hoping to finally see a worthy follow-up to the first two movies now. In particular, I feel like the horror aspect of the story has so much potential and I'd love to see a Terminator that's finally scary again. This may be the final Terminator movie that Arnold is willing to do, so I'm really rooting for it to be great. PS: Old Man Conan please!</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Hey mate, every cross is different. Some follow the Trichocereus, some follow the Echinopsis (in regards to the body), some are fertile and some not so much. Trichocereus and Echinopsis are closely related and most cross with each other. Trichocereus pachanoi, Trichocereus peruvianus and Trichocereus bridgesii are sister species and definitely very close.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Lots of species or even genera can cross with each other and it's not a reliable tool to judge about genetic proximity. It can help as an indicator because some wildly different cacti do not match and usually do not cross, but there's an endless list of cacti that do cross, eventhough they are rather distant. Wide crosses like these can have a higher risk of infertile or genetically weak offspring, but ot normally isn't a problem within the genus Trichocereus.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I'm a cactus breeder and I spent a few thousand on two high quality greenhouses. I've always dreamed about breeding cacti commercially, but was never able to afford it. Ten years ago I was really poor and could barely cover the heating costs for my own house, not speaking of heating or buying greenhouses. But yeah, worked very hard and was finally able to afford these two greenhouses recently. They are very well built with massive Aluminum that withstands strong storms, and the window glass is super thick polycarbonate with UV coating to prevent sunburn. Before I bought these, I had a super cheap China greenhouse that was so shaky that I spent whole nights in the garden trying to keep it together, and when it finally went airborne one day I finally decided to never buy cheap again. Best decision I've made in a long time. In the past, I woke up at every little wind because I was worried it would get damaged again. Now I sleep like a baby, even when there's heavy storm. I know both are very well built and nothing will happen. And the cacti love them. Feeling blessed and I'd always buy these again.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I live in Germany and both of the number plates shown on these two cars aren't normal German plates. They almost always have two letters at the front (some combinations cannot be used because of the strict anti-nazi laws) and KKK isn't possible like that either. There are other number plates for diplomats, Bundeswehr, Police, Insurance companies etc, but none would be crazy enough to get KKK as they are a banned organization here. It's definitely possible that the photo was taken in Germany and shows a car from another country, but you'd probably get in real trouble if you'd try to officially ask for that plate in Germany. And yeah, German number plates are bigger, so not sure where it's from. Could be Austria, Poland, etc. Can't see it well enough.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>In these areas, Asbestos is an important factor that can make a big difference when taking down the wrong trap house. Asbestos has to be removed in a wet state to prevent the particles from going airborne and the houses there have a lot of it. So if house A is listed as containing no Asbestos and they bring Mr. MC Hammer to tear down the whole thing and knock down the wrong house using no such protection instead, they can cover the whole area including neighboring houses with particles. Needless to say, it can potentially cause immense liability issues in case someone can prove they didn't follow suit there and I think that's one of the main reasons it could be a problem.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Putting in a few cheap jump scares is much easier to do than crafting genuinely scary and creepy horror. It's a cheap trick that lots of mediocre directors can pull off. It's become so predictable that you can even hear them coming in because they normally reduce the volume before them to increase the effect. I think it's poor film making and it makes me appreciate horror films that don't resort to it even more.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>The part at the top with the pins is probably what's left of a wood handle. This is how rotten iron knifes or tools with wood handle look after they've been in the ground for a long time. The wood usually rots away and you end up with the pins and the rusty metal. Hard to tell what it exactly was, but it could've very well been a knife. There isn't enough substance left to say for sure.</TEXT>

Could've been a knob or a handle, something decorative, an animal statue etc. It kind of looks like a horse-head with the mouth at the long center part and the two ears at the top. This would point towards a knob from a knife or weapon. But yeah, probably Roman or very early medieval at the latest. Nice!</TEXT>

The material is definitely Bronze. It is a bit thicker than most other hairpins we see around Europe, but I still think it's probably one.

    <TEXT>I see the similarities to WW2 German medals, but I am pretty sure it's not German. At least not from the German military. To me it looks like it could be a somewhat primitive cast or small scale private production. Original medals from this time were very detailed and even the late WW2 stuff has a different quality than this one. It looks interesting and I have no idea about Finnish medals, but a few more photos from all angles including the back wouldn't hurt. Medals usually have tiny makers marks.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Yeah, this belongs to Echinopsis terscheckii, also known as Trichocereus terscheckii. When and how to water it depends on your climate. If this is an inside plant, I'd probably put it in mineral soil consisting of mostly Pumice, Lava and a bit of sowing soil or coir mixed in between. Then they are more forgiving than when you have em in a rather organic soil. My plants are in a greenhouse and I only water them between March and October. During winter the temperatures are very low and the plants kinda hibernate. When kept inside, you'd best overwinter it at 10 degree Celsius and with barely any water until spring. If you keep it at room temperatures with heating, you need to water it every once in a while and provide enough light to keep it from etiolating. But don't overdo it with the water and let the soil dry out in between watering. Soil that stays wet for too long is a lot more problematic than watering a bit late. These cacti are relatively drought tolerant, but the roots can rot very easily.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Alright, what I can tell you that the material is cast iron. So it might have been made to resemble an original medal. Time frame is almost certainly after WW2 and looks like a very rough work. Stuff like this was sometimes made for veteran meetups or something unofficial like medals made at the frontlines. It doesn't have a lot of wesr though. Could even be something like carnival medals or a later reproduction made to resemble the German medals from WW2. I can definitely rule out anything official from the German military for this one. There are some late German medals that have wonky quality due to shortage of metals and where the eagle resembles a chicken a little bit, but nothing like this. I don't think it would've passed quality control of any of the medal makers at the time. And yeah, since it also seems to lack a maker's mark, I think this is something unofficial. Sorry, wish I could help more than that.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I'm not sure if the fibers are Asbestos or Fiberglass, but I would still handle it with great care, e.g. avoiding too much movement and disturbance of the fibers inside. Though it would be less problematic if it's Fiberglass, there are quite a few mineral products that can be just as cancerogen if inhaled. It's not only about which fibers you inhale, but how they split and act in the lungs. I personally avoid everything that looks like this. Not worth risking your lung for a 30 bucks gimmick.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I was really looking forward to it after the praise in an earlier thread, but after three episodes I was rather disappointed and have to force myself to pick it up again. The horror just doesn't work for me so far. The demons are chatty and have long winded discussions with the protagonist and it often takes all the horror out of the scenes. Think THE EXORCIST and it suddenly turns into an episode of Maury where Pazuzu just can't stop debating all his motives for an hour. I love stuff about Exorcisms, but I feel like there's so much unused potential. It's typical cable TV horror and it certainly has some strengths and good moments, but I expected more of it.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Pretty sure this is an Iron Cross 1st or 2nd class 1939, backside necessary to say more. A Knight's Cross looks very similar but is extremely rare and was awarded more scarcely. Knight's cross has a solid ring that's connected at the top (instead of a much more fragile ring on the EK2) and a backpin on the EK1. Knight's cross has a big oak leaf in the center on the back and there's millions of reproductions.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Yes, these Echinopsis species often work as fathers for Trichocereus species. However, using Scop and similar Trichocereus species as father for these Echinopsis almost always fails. This is due to the long tubes on the Echinopsis flowers. The Trichocereus pollen is just hot made to reach the ovum at the bottom of the Echinopsis flower tube.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Hey mate, they usually flower in flushes and the flowers emerge from the areoles. I'm a Cactus breeder and I kinda went pro when I finally built me a bigger greenhouse two years ago. And yeah, haven't been happier ever since. You normally take pollen from one Cactus and put it on the stigma of another flower. This way you get seeds. It's extremely rewarding when you see your own hybrids growing up.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>It really depends on your climate and the cacti you choose. Some like Echinopsis, Epiphyllum, Cleistocactus Chamaecereus (now seen as Lobivia) and Mammillaria flower very easily and reliably, even if you can only bring them outside in summer. So if you want to start with something, these were the most reliable in regards to flowering. Some others require a dark and cold winter period to flower reliably, for example Trichocereus. I had lots of trouble getting my larger Trichocereus to flower until I got a greenhouse. It's just closer to their natural environment and the greenhouse is one of the reasons my plants flower a lot now. I also fertilize regularly and give my plants all kinds of plant extracts to spoil them. Lol. It's not really low maintenance, but it's very fun as soon as you finally get to the point where they thrive.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Battlestar Galactica, the remake. I just love Edward James Olmos as Adama and I'll probably keep revisiting the series every ten years or so for the rest of my life. Some of the CGI are incredibly dated though. For the time it was great and there are some that still look decent, but others look horrible now. But again, I just love the general theme and what Olmos did with Adama.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>So the one on the lower left is a Trichocereus bridgesii. Upper left is probably what's known as California Caterpillar. The dark blue one on the lower right pic is a Pilosocereus, like Pilosocereus palmeri or a similar Pilo species. The Trichos on upper right on lower light photos need closer inspection. Could be Trichocereus bridgesii too, PC or PC hybrids etc.. hard to tell just from one photo. Hope this helps.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I'd definitely be worried but not much you can do apart from cutting them, which is not really what I would do here. It will probably heal, but there will probably be scars. Sometimes these scars can be so bad it causes the active growth to terminate and then pup again, but this here will probably heal without causing termination. Looks like the tips were either burnt or got a light frost damage.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Took me until Saturday to watch JOKER because I was annoyed by all the hype and memes. Felt like it's one of these toxic "Harley Quinn is so badass"-like movies that just live off portraying abuse and toxic behavior as something cool. Instead I saw a masterpiece and one of the most realistic depictions of mental illness I've ever seen. Joaquin Phoenix's performance is incredible and he deserves the Oscar. I was genuinely impressed, even though I already knew him as an outstanding actor.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>The quality is very impressive. I haven't seen this quality on reproductions before, so I'd definitely consider the option that it's really old. Like 19th century old. I was born in Germany and this does not look typical of German ships. My first impression was that it's British, or French. Seen a lot of Lions on Napoleonic equipment from that time. But yeah, I'd take this to a museum or a ship historian. I'm sure they can date this very precisely.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Here's an old photo that shows the cheap discount greenhouse I got after the first real storm. Got it ages ago but had a bad feeling after seeing the manual, so I had put the actual completion on hold for some years. But eventually I got my ass up to put it together and the building process was already a nightmare. Sarah's parents helped with the construction and I wanna just say that it put the whole family under substantial stress.  #128513; After weeks of dealing with the crappy system, we got it up though. For a while. So, we had storm and I already spent the night outside trying to keep the light and cheap window panels from flying away. Injured myself pretty badly on the sharp frame and ended up putting in additional hooks on the base and glued some of the panels into the frame. Then I went to bed, tired, exhausted and depressed because I realized I was a fool to spend so little on something this important for a breeder. Right after going pro, I wanted to get everything done right away. No patience, just passion. Let's say mistakes were made. So yeah, came out the morning after and couldn't see the greenhouse on the place it was built. I was like "nah, that can't be" because I had basically cemented the whole frame into the ground like an Egyptian pyramid. So I went to check and found the train wreck you can see on the pic. The base was still there, but the cheap hook system that held the greenhouse on the base had failed. The greenhouse hit a tree stump and looked like the torn apart garbage can it actually was. Took me days to collect all the trash from my garden and all the plants that were inside were pretty much lost. That day I went inside and went straight to bed. Like, at 10 in the morning.  #128514; When I got up, I got me a pickaxe and and axe and punched the living hell out of the greenhouse's corpse, and with it burying my dreams for another year. That's the end of my tale about Patrick and the garbage greenhouse. In 2017 I decided to buy me a quality greenhouse from a German manufacturer and I completely love it. Its frame and base are solid Aluminum that has an included warranty of 15 years or so, and super thick lexan windows that filter UV. The system is so well built that it would probably withstand any kind of storm that we get here. Earlier I spent whole nights in the garden looking for my trash. Now I sleep like a baby, even at the worst storms. Money well spent.  #129392;</TEXT>

    <TEXT>You know, it really depends how much water reserves they still have. I generally avoid watering seedlings in organic soil too early in the season, and if I do it it's only when it's really necessary. A bit of water now might not hurt and even improve their health a bit short term, but with late frosts still coming it would probably be a bit of a gamble how fast the soil gets dry again and how cold it actually gets. Really depends on the temperatures and air humidity in the coming weeks. If you decide to spray them a bit, be rather conservative with the water and don't water again until it's dry.</TEXT>

And yeah, stuff like this is really of limited value because all kinds of clones, hybrids and PC offspring are often identified as PC. Usually via poor photos and without actual knowledge of the fact that one and the same clone can look wildly different, depending on where it is grown. How would someone know if a plant is the actual cloned PC, or PC offspring which just follows the phenotype of the mother/father? So yeah, I'd take everything written about PC with a grain of salt.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I'm pretty sure I know where they came from. This should be a strain from the Chavin Herbalist Matucana collection. The area is full of Trichocereus peruvianus, with very very few Trichocereus pachanoi in between. They did collect seeds from some Trichocereus pachanoi in private gardens, but it's pretty likely they were open pollinated with nothing but Trichocereus peruvianus growing around them. So it would make sense that the offspring goes towards Trichocereus peruvianus. But yeah, could also be that they had trouble telling the difference between a rather spineless Peru and a Trichocereus pachanoi.  #129335; #8205; #9794; #65039;</TEXT>

    <TEXT>This is a sunburn because the pup was in total darkness underground. Some heal, some do not. Since it's at the base it could theoretically spread to the main column IF it doesn't heal and spread. Big IF. I'd probably remove all soil around the pup to keep it ventilated and visible. If necessary you can cut the pup at the bottom of the pup. Try not to cut the main column, just the pup.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>You have lots of time as long oxygen is getting all around the pup. Infections rarely spread to or from pups and if they do it often takes months. I had one just like this one and I just cut away the upper half of the pup and the bottom has now pupped again. But yeah, you can observe this for a few weeks to see how it goes. My gut feeling is that it might very well heal, but it will always look a bit messy and pose a risk of it coming back after a longer time. Happens rarely too, but does happen every now and then.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Happy to help. If the infection goes deeper than what's visible it's best to cut it off now. It looks like it might've spread to the core and if that's the case you would probably see more damage further down. If it's in the core the pup is lost. Stuff like this is often unpredictable because you can't see what's inside. If in doubt, wait a bit and cut it off if it gets worse.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>It's not that Neem oil cannot be used. It is great when it works, but you have to be extremely careful about sunburn because the plants become super sensitive during and after treatment. Alternatives for oily products are pesticides that only have the active Neem chemical (I think Azamax is one), Spinosad, Imidacloprid, Neonicotinoids. Needless to say some are very toxic and might even not be permitted in your country. Some of these pests are very hardy and it's not easy to kill them. So there isn't an easy formula you can follow.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Yeah, the difference in skin color is probably because of it being kept out of the sun a bit. The spines are a bit smaller like they'd normally be too. And yeah, every plant has a different nutrient availability due to soil pH, soil composition and other chemicals present in the soil, genetic situation or infections, brand of fertilizer used etc. It also depends on how they were grown before you got them.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>KK242 was sold as a Trichocereus peruvianus. It came from the Peruvian collector Karel Knize and he sold like 10 different strains under that name. Every one of them different, some were Trichocereus peruvianus, but most came out classic Trichocereus cuzcoensis like what you have there. Knize's numbers stand for a certain area, e.g. KK242 from Matucana. This means all plants he collected in Matucana were sold as KK242. It's not how most field botanists label their collections and I can't recommend that system because of all the problems it creates. Here's an article on the subject. https://trichocereus.net/kk242-trichocereus-cuzcoensis-more/</TEXT>

Neem oil and white oil can also be used for treatment of the soil/roots alone, but I personally wouldn't use them on precious plants and avoid doing it in the sun and not on the body itself. There's people that use Neem on their plants without running into problems as long as they keep their plants in the dark for weeks, but I'm not a fan of oil. But yeah, these are the most effective ones that are still available in some countries. Hope it helps.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Echinopsis subdenudata is one of the oldest plants that were used in hybrid breeding. There are some very beautiful hybrids involving it, and most follow Echinopsis subdenudata in regards to the rib shape. The flowers of Echinopsis subdenudata are white in color, but there #180;s still a lot of unused potential because of their beautiful shape. I #180;ve seen very nice hybrids between Trichocereus scopulicola and E.subdenudata and I am sure there will be many more hybrids involving it in the future. If your goal is to breed hybrids with a beautiful and unique body, Echinopsis subdenudata should be on top of your list! https://youtube.com/watch?v=BTDZoMTsxd8</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Part of my collection. The video was taken roughly a week ago and since then the plants have gotten lots and lots of flower buds. Almost all of the mature plants I own are flowering and I'm just extremely proud about having reached this stage as a breeder. There were times when it was a pain and frustration, times when I lost plant after plant. I think in my whole career as a breeder I had at least two moments when I thought I couldn't take it anymore and wanted to stop breeding cacti completely. Luckily I stuck to it and every setback brought me a bit closer to my goal of becoming a world class Cactus breeder. When my plants didn't flower, I researched and worked on my methods until they did. When they wouldn't grow or had root rot, I adapted and changed the soil they got and looked into the whole field of fertilizers and plant extracts that are out there. And with every little new thing I learned, I became a better breeder. All of this has also made me a better person and I have never been more happy and proud my whole life. Long story short, NEVER STOP LEARNING. Every little piece brings you closer to the whole picture, like a puzzle.  #9996; #128077;</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Fertilization Day. Holy moly, this is serious work. Now is the time that matters the most, so I provide lots of water and nutrients. Since I started watering and fertilizing angrily, lots of plants that are actually not big enough to flower yet have pushed out flower buds. And yeah, the majority of the plants already have lots of flower buds and it's only the very beginning of the season. There will be more flushes. It's actually some kind of art and once you get to the point where you can see your plants react well to your treatment, you feel like the king of the world.  #128522;</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Yes, get a top notch commercial grade fertilizer for sensitive and expensive crops that doesn't cause burns. If I'd do the fertilizing regimen that I'm doing with some of the cheaper fertilizers I'd burn the hell out of my plants. Also, it shouldn't be too high in N because it causes follow up problems like vulnerability to fungal infections if there's too much N in the fertilizer. Right now I use Wuxal Super as regular fertilizer and Hakaphos Soft Novelle as flower fertilizer. Wuxal is something like 8-8-11 and Hakaphos is 11-11-30. You probably won't get those brands outside the EU, but there are almost certainly comparable ones where you live. Wuxal has a pH buffer that sets the pH at 5.5 to 6.5 and can be foliar fed and the plants love it. And yeah, good mineral soil is essential. I mostly use Pumice, Lava and Coir. Maybe a bit of charcoal but that's it. The mineral soil dries out faster, which allows you to fertilize and water more during the import time between March and September. I water and fertilize at least once a week during the main season and I spray with plant extracts like garlic, Valerian flower, horsetail, coconut water etc once a week too. Lots of work, but the plants love it and I have so many flowers I have trouble pollinating them all.  #128522; #128077; Came a long way to this point and if I can do it everyone can. You learn from every failure and loss you have and I had many. Lol.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Hey mate, great to see you around.  #128522; I personally use smaller pots to promote flowering and my results prove me right. I do not want my plants to invest all their energy into growing a bigger rootstock. I'm a breeder and to me it's most important they flower. Smaller pots dry out faster, which means I can water and fertilize more often, without keeping the roots wet for weeks. So yeah, they flower a lot more like this because of how I fertilize and water in between drying out. During the flower season they get water and fertilizer twice a week. It's a special fertilizer for expensive and sensitive crops called Wuxal Super and it's 8-8-11. It has a pH buffer and foliar feeding. I also use a flower fertilizer called Hakaphos Soft Novelle that's something like 11-11-30.</TEXT>

I use all kinds of soil mixes, and this is just one of them, but looking back it produced some amazing results and I will probably pick a similar one again this year. Check it out. : https://youtu.be/QQfjm4W0vlw</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Had a manic day and got something done. Started with uploading some videos to the channels, post some memes and then I went straight into the garden to film some videos for the second season of Cactus Jerk.  #128077; I made a great unboxing video with new plants like Flying Saucer, Pink Stripes, Otto Lehmann and others. Really good and rare ones, so check out the Cactus Jerk channel on YouTube.com/c/subject3227 if you want to check that out. And yeah, then I repotted some plants that I want to give a push for the season. The ones that don't have flower buds yet will be repotted and fertilized more aggressively. Every additional plant whose flower I can see and judge is a success. I need to sort out the weaker flowers as soon as possible. Gives me more space to grow awesome ones.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Clip from the greenhouse. Was repotting seedlings today and I'm tired as hell. Had used some seaweed extract a few months ago and it changed the structure of the seedling soil in a way I didn't like, so I had to repot. If you want to make sure that your seedlings survive, repot them as often as necessary. If you see something you don't like then it's always best to take action. Apart from this there will be some flowers opening this week. Lobivia hybrid EASTER PARADE will probably open first.  #129392;  #127797;</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Hey mate, the etiolation is hard to get a grip on. It'll probably stay somewhat thin in that particular part, but you can certainly work against it by giving more sun and nutrients. I'd probably pot it in Pumice and give it a smaller pot. It dries out faster and that gives you the chance to fertilize and water more often. And yeah, a good quality fertilizer might be a good investment. Hard to tell what it is because there are so many hybrids, which I think it probably is.</TEXT>

Check out the channel at YouTube.com/c/subject3227 to watch the videos we take from the collection.  #127797;If only one third of the flower buds come through it will be an epic year.  #129392;</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Hey mate, sunburn isn't really an issue to me since I keep my plants outside in the greenhouses all year round. Sunburn happens a lot when people are overwintering their plants inside and bring them out in spring. That aside, last year was the hottest summer ever recorded with the most brutal UV we ever had. There were some plants that had minor spots here and there during the height of the record heatwave, and this year might even be worse. We'll see. But sunburn can be an issue, but in good quality greenhouses it's often not.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Hey mate, a great quality fertilizer and a good soil are what helped me the most. Also, a cold winter period helps a lot to induce flowering. And yeah, lots of little things like plant extracts to help with general health (Valerian flower extract, coconut water, horsetail extract, garlic, seaweed etc.) It's certainly a lot of work, but if you want to get as many flowers as possible these things all add up. If you need help or advice I'm always happy to help.  #128522;</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Been there, done that.  #128513; Killed so many plants that I sometimes cringe at night, but at some point you run out of mistakes to make. Next time water some more, or get a soil that holds water a bit longer. Pumice is a great mineral with amazing capabilities to store water. It's my main medium these days.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Here's what I do to bulk plants up. Every plant that I get gets fatter and most end up with twice the diameter they had before. I use Wuxal Super as main fertilizer and Hakaphos Soft Novelle as flower fertilizer. In addition I give Valerian flower extract, Horsetail extract, seaweed extract, garlic extract, coconut water and a corn extract with a sour pH buffer. You don't need all of those and you can replace the fertilizer brands with stuff you have available in your country, but if you use something like this every 1-2 weeks your plants will go completely bonkers.  #128526;</TEXT>

    <TEXT>My first main flower flush was so extreme that it was barely possible to handle it all. Closed down the greenhouse for a few days to keep out pollinators and just pollinated what I could. Apart from a few mediocre Echinopsis hybrids I pollinated them all. Will try to post more updates, but this whole pollination marathon took such a hard toll on my body that I've slept all day and will take a while to recover. But yeah, I'm on my feet again.  #9996;</TEXT>

    <TEXT>There's something that seems to be overlooked in this whole discussion about the ending scene. At least I've never seen it being mentioned in the threads or discussions. The actor who played the FBI agent gave a pretty obvious interview at a red carpet event for the series finale, and he said that they had a more obvious version of the ending in the script where you see the Members Only Hitman coming to the table with a drawn gun and then it fades to black. That's pretty obvious, all the obvious foreshadowing aside. The interview was available on YouTube a few years ago. But yeah, one of the best ending scenes ever. Great ending for Tony.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Every plant has a different root system and nutrient availability. You can check the roots for problems like root Mealies and whether or not it even has an adequate root system. If it doesn't that might be the reason. Just because three plants are beside each other, it doesn't mean that all have the same root system. Another reason can be Virus infections, which can substantially weaken a plant and are hard to verify. Also, it's possible that the structure of the soil below this plant just doesn't store enough water compared to what's left and right of it. Theres many possibilities, so you really need to look into this more closely to find out why this one doesn't have adequate water and nutrient supply. The only thing that's obvious is that the water doesn't seem to get to the plant.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Hey mate, this is nothing I'd be concerned about. These are scars from an injury, and it will take many years until this is grown out. It's even possible it'll never grow out completely and it'll always have a bunch of scars around the base. It's not really an infection that keeps on going though. Scars change and might even look worse throughout the course of the healing, but there isn't anything you can do right now, apart from providing fresh air, good care and avoiding more injuries or sunburns.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>It has turned into a serious task. Normally I'd just hose them all down twice a week and I'd be done in half an hour. However, I try to fertilize every time I'm watering during the main season and I can't do that with the hose. I need the right concentration of the fertilizer and I usually do it with large 10L cans. It takes a few hours per greenhouse and there are three of them. FML. Lol. I'll probably have to find a way to combine the hose with the fertilizer next year. Watering a collection this size with a can is like walking a little marathon.</TEXT>

I use a combination of a special foliar feeding fertilizer that's something like 8-8-11, a special flower fertilizer that's 11-11-30 and a magnitude of plant extracts like Horsetail, Seaweed, Valerian flower extract, coconut water, garlic extract etc. This combination makes them seriously thick and healthy. I fertilize at least once a week during the main season.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>There's few countries where you can plant everything out and if I'd do this where I live my plants would die reliably every year. There's frost hardy plants, but many aren't and would not survive the winter. With the greenhouse you can prolong the season. You already have your plants actively growing at a time when there's still night frosts between late February and April and It also adds a few months to your growing season towards the winter. And yeah, a greenhouse enables you to control the climate completely, which can never be done outside. It protects your seedlings from the elements and animals, which greatly increases your yield.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I am well aware of the description of Trichocereus macrogonus and its traits. This is a historic plant from the early time Trichocereus macrogonus was first cooked up and it's important to keep those plants labeled as they were. It has zilch to do with this plant being actually considered to be a correct Trichocereus macrogonus. It's keeping old labels around so we can trace back their history and which plants were applied to that name at the time. Just because we recently started applying the name Trichocereus macrogonus to a certain type of glaucous Matucana Peruvianus, it doesn't mean it was always like that. In the past there were at least seven Trichocereus species that were sold or thrown into that name, and even plants from the genus Pilosocereus. Trichocereus taquimbalensis has brown spines too and it would fit the description too. Older cultivars or clones that have history shouldn't be relabeled every time the wind of nomenclature blows into a certain direction. The description of Trichocereus macrogonus was a mess, lacking a description of the flowers, the country of origin, a herbarium specimen and anything other than the fact it is supposed to have brown spines. Joel is using the name for a certain form of Trichocereus peruvianus with brown spines and a slightly different body type, but you could put those into Peruvianus as well. It's a very variable species. The name Trichocereus macrogonus just doesn't meet scientific standards, so discussing what is or isn't a true Macrogonus is guessing. I agree that this plant isn't really the type of plant that fits the description terribly well, but it's still part of this species' history.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Yeah, the name Trichocereus macrogonus is problematic because there's no firm baseline to compare to. At the same time, the species is integral for the genus Trichocereus. I'm almost certain it'll be used for dark blue Trichocereus with brown spines like the ones from Matucana, but it comes with lots of baggage. I personally love this plant and it looks a bit different to most of my Trichocereus bridgesii, but I still see this one as something connected to Trichocereus bridgesii. Not sure who originally sold those as Macro, but he was probably just applying the name because of the long spines and the glaucous epidermis. Which looks like it's from another planet.  #128076;</TEXT>

    <TEXT>They have some great and ultra rare plants and were the source of many good Trichocereus clones. A few years ago they ran into trouble with personal tragedies and stuff like that, and it sounds like they are still struggling. Hope they can recover, because they have an amazing selection. Orders take quite some time these days though. For someone that doesn't know what's going on behind closed doors it's probably difficult to understand.</TEXT>

They will now get full sun, full nutrients and no more humidity than what's absolutely necessary. I also put holes into them to provide drainage now. I want the soil to dry ASAP so I can water and fertilize more often. Overall, very happy with those. Almost all are already big enough to make it through winter.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Hey mate, I'm using Coir in all my soil mixes and it completely replaced peat for me. Love the stuff.  #128077; This year my whole operation exploded and these were grown under minimal care. I have thrice as many seedlings in the other greenhouse and they're twice as big because I had more time for fertilizing repotting and watering. Wanted to make sure the seedlings can stay healthy until the main flower Flush is over and now I have finally more time for fertilizing, watering and that kind of stuff. They are already big enough to survive the winter, but they will grow substantially in the next weeks.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Hey mate, I've sown out between December-February and the seedlings from that time are roughly 2-3x as big as those here because they were fertilized a lot sooner. Was hit by a big flower Flush and just had to take care of that one first. The seedlings in the photo were sown between February and May and didn't get any fertilizer yet. I wanted to hold back nutrients to reduce fungal problems in the first couple months. You could grow those to thrice the size in the same time if you fertilize accordingly and put them in full sun. You'll have to do a lot more misting and watering then though.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Yeah, that's nothing to worry about. Might also be the start of aerial roots. It happens a lot on Trichocereus bridgesii. The correct Echinopsis name is Echinopsis lageniformis btw. Echinopsis bridgesii was already taken by a little Bolivian Echinopsis.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>It always depends on the temperature you have in your grow room. The higher the temperature, the more light you need. You can keep plants in total darkness at 10 #176; Celsius and they will not etiolate. Once you put them in a heated living room they need light, water and nutrients.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Could be correct. Trichocereus purpureopilosus is a species that belongs to the Trichocereus candicans/Trichocereus candicans complex and this one here has spines that fall within the range of Trichocereus candicans. Post the flowers when they open.  #128077;</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Well yeah, you sometimes see it on young Trichocereus seedlings, but it's rather rare. It could also be an Azureocereus hertlingianus/Browningia hertlingiana and at this size it's neatly impossible to keep them apart. A few more centimeters are necessary to say it for sure.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>At this size it's difficult to differentiate all forms. There's total chaos because so many Trichocereus taquimbalensis are being sold as Trichocereus werdermannianus and Trichocereus werdermannianus is often sold as Trichocereus terscheckii. Imo this is Trichocereus taquimbalensis. Trichocereus werdermannianus is very fat and most younger ones look much more like dark gray Trichocereus terscheckii, which is what they are almost always identified as.</TEXT>
