    <TEXT>I get your point about preferring zapdos, I prefer articuno. not for any particular reason I just think he looks cool... plus he was the first legendary bird I caught and I remember one of his moves was 1 hit KO so I used that all the time From what I remember about the anouncment of the team leaders, it was about where they thought the power of Pokemon came from. Valour thought it could be trained (giving candies), mystic thought it was genetic and came from evolution and breeding (IV's) and instinct thought it was about the heart of the Pokemon (EV's in the core games - not introduced in PoGo yet). They're all important but I guess mystic's really stuck with me</TEXT>

    <TEXT>two characters in a story I'm writing have names that look like they should sound on paper but in my head they don't. The names are Variel (with a short "a" like carry or magic) and Cariel (with a long "a" like car or star or far). Has any author pulled this off effectively? the only other example I can think of is the DC/Vertigo character Constantine. The last part of his name was supposed to sound like time or mime (think ConstanTYNE), but in the tv shows and other media his name rhymes with mean or scheme (think ConstanTEEN). Are there any examples of where this has worked well?</TEXT>

Then Thanos arrives and forces the dwarves to make the gauntlet. he takes the gauntlet back to his evil base, and this is where the end credits scene from age of ultron comes in. then he attacks the nova Corp for the power stone, and then it's the end credits scene from ragnarok (followed closely by the start of infinity war). I think this best explains everything but let me know if you have any suggestions</TEXT>

    <TEXT>first off, you should definitely try to watch from season 1. Tennant is amazing as the doctor and Eccleston is top notch too. in terms of main villains, the only one you really need to watch out for is the master, a Time Lord that went mad, used all his regenerations because he didn't like them, died, got resurected by his human wife, ate an entire roast chicken, and dissapeared stopping the time Lords escaping the time lock. the main point you need to bear in mind is the time lock itself, when the daleks and time Lords were fighting the time war the doctor killed everyone on both sides and locked the event with the time lock. it's a little more complicated than that and you'll need to read up before the 50th anniversary episode! The screwdriver can do pretty much whatever the plot needs it to, with the exception that it doesn't work on wood. And everything looks so retro because that's how it was when the show was created, and it would kind of break cannon if they changed it too much. the new daleks introduced with Matt Smith didn't last long because they were too "new". hope this helps :)</TEXT>

    <TITLE>Kindle Keypad keeps freezing and restarting?</TITLE>
    <DATE>2018-09-07 11:16:34</DATE>
    <TEXT>Hi everyone, pretty much what the title says. I've had my kindle for a while now and I couldn't be happier with it. however, just this week its started freezing randomly for long periods of time, then restarting itself. I've re-installed the firmware on it and I thought this had worked for a few minutes, but not for long. Does anyone have any solutions? Thanks in advance  #8203; Edit: the one thing updating the firmware did do is that now the charging light turns on and off when charging even when frozen. Not sure if this helps but I'd like to think it narrows down the possibilities</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Having an extra villain draws focus from the main villain and makes them pose less of a threat. Black Panther was s good film but it could have been a great film if there was less Klaue and more Kilmonger. Dark night had the joker as the main villain and as part of the threat he posed he managed to corrupt the DA into murdering people, making him more of a threat not less 1000 villains is just ridiculous</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Im sure you all know of "the hero's journey" : hero is in a normal world, hero gets introduced to magic, hero goes on to save this new magical world from the big evil threat. However, the story I have in my head involves two types of magic, the users of which are at war with each other. Long story short, the main character ends up with both types but with a delay between the two. Seeing that this doesn't fit into the normally story telling lines, I'm worried about the pacing. Should readers learn about type A powers in depth before type B? Or should there only be a few pages between them, even if it takes up more "in book" time? Thanks in advance for all your help, if you have any books or stories where something similar has happened let me know</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Most of the companions say that the first time, leading to a meta moment with iirc martha which I won't spoil for you. It's one of the staples of the show, along with "I can't just call you doctor, doctor who?" The doctor doesn't really have powers so to speak, apart from the regeneration, and apparently picking up on tiny things that regular. People can't sense (the rotation of a planet, telling what time period he's in by the taste of the air, etc). Assuming you're starting from the begining of new who, the leather jacket wearing doctor is Christopher eccleston. He's credited as. The 9th doctor but there was another "war" doctor retroactively added between 8 and 9. I won't tell you if we find out his real name, it's part of the mystery. Pronouns are the same as the gender of the actor/actress. I definitely recommend watching more of who, S1 was a great starting point but it gets a lot better!

    <TEXT>Fair Enough. For my personal destiny story I got D2 when it came out as a free PSN game and bought forsaken not long after that. In my opinion I wasn't too drawn in hunting for uldren at the beginning because I hadn't played the taken king. But dealing with the scorn barons towards the end was amazing. In meta terms, playing gambit is the most fun I've ever had playing anything destiny and this one game mode I feel is the same value as the whole forsaken story line.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Initially there was D2. Then there were two expansions called corse of osiris and warmind (both of which are sold with forsaken). Then afterwards there was the annual pass containing seasons of the forge, the drifter, and opulence. That's the order they were released in and they all add in extra parts to the story. If I were you, I would get forsaken now with the two expansions. When shadow keep launches in September (the next part of the story) there might be a deal on getting the annual pass as well. I'm not saying there 100% will be,but there might. If you like forsaken then the annual pass will be worth it, and hopefully shadowkeep will be worth it too. Message me if you need anything more</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Sounds like you're talking about the leviathan raid... You've got the basic parts, there are a number of encounters that you have to figure out and require a lot of teamwork and communication,while Being careful not to die. For leviathan, there's the baths, dogs, the gauntlet and finally calus the boss. You have to work through each of the encounters which can take time. If too many people die or something doesn't go to plan then you wipe (everyone kills themselves) which restarts the encounter not the whole raid. Hope this helps :)</TEXT>

    <TEXT>As much as I agree with you, I think the omunity has been scarred too much by the percy jackson films. The best thing to do is similar to what the arrowverse did when they made a show about green arrow instead of batman. I think the best choice for a TV show is the kane chronicles. There are a few things that would need tweaking to go from book to screen, I think the biggest one would be a video diary instead of a tape recorder. With this, the backdrop for each episode would change too so that the fans would spot what's coming next (eg talking about the british museum with a backdrop of brooklyn House. Talking about running from the metal men with a backdrop of Cairo airport ect). This would also allow the interactions between characters to be fleshed out a little bit. The characters go all over the world, but most of the first book is set in the desert so it would be cheaper to make. And if you're aiming for 1 book = 1 season there are a few threads left over at the end of book 3 to make a fourth season. Finally, seeing that Disney bought fox a while back (and made Alexandra daario a Disney princess) the show could be made for release on Disney+ rather than Netflix. TLDR kane chronicles would make a good TV show</TEXT>

    <TEXT>You could be a descendant of those in the past, but that would be very very unlikely. For example, if your great grandmother has a child with ares, then that child( your grandmother) has a child with haephestus, and then that child (your mother) has a child with hades you could be perceived to be a child of three gods. But this would be almost impossible as a child of one god almost definitely won't attract the interest of another god. Lastly, if you really wanted this combo it might be better to go for Mars/pluto/vulcan as people in new Rome live longer and have children, whereas camp halfblood rarely sees adults</TEXT>

    <TEXT>This the only good thing I think there is about the avatar live action movie they made. The fire benders need fire to bend they can't just make it. The fire nation has to lob flaming balls into a fight just to start the conflict. It gives another layer to Iroh "the dragon of the west" and could be interesting for the day of black sun/sozins comet if they ever got that far Note:I do not think the live action film was better than the anime in any way, just this point was a good choice. And also the avatar test. But that's it.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Heard a good idea a whole ago where one pair of twins hooked up with another pair of twins and the kids were both avatars, but one of them was the dark avatar because of vaatu and they spent years trying to figure out which one was the good one and which was the evil one. Could be intersting</TEXT>

    <TITLE>Do helmets now drop from reckoning too?</TITLE>
    <DATE>2020-08-21 19:43:27</DATE>
    <TEXT>As it the title really, I realised I didn't have the reaper helmet or some of the invader pieces. I was doing the reckoning as part of the quest to get the helmet and used the invader motes to get up my armour for the invader. Then to my surprise an invader helmet dropped from completing the reckoning. I've had a brief look online but I can't see anything that says it. Have I broken the game? Is this a glitch? Or have bungle changed the way you get gear from activities that are a year old?</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Good morning/evening/afternoon guardians, I've been thinking of getting a mask with some destiny logos on it. Ideally it would be the destiny logo on one side and the gambit coiled snakes on the other side. I'd love to see some pictures of any destiny masks, and let me know where you got it from!</TEXT>

    <TITLE>Why are raids replayable?</TITLE>
    <DATE>2020-10-11 23:27:18</DATE>
    <TEXT>This doesn't apply to all raids. Leviathan and SOTP are replayable because they're bosses are robots so they can be rebuilt (we even see hundreds of calus robots). Last wish is replayable because that's the nature of rivens curse. But why are raids like Crown of sorrow and garden of salvation replayable? At the end when you defeat the boss, ghalran disintegrates and the sol inherent turns into a statue, so that should be it right? We don't need to keep sending fireteams in because there isn't a threat any more</TEXT>
