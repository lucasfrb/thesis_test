    <TEXT>I had the same thing (pvc) happen out of the blue about 12 years ago. It was debilitating because it interfered with my sleep for weeks on end. There was nothing that helped. Saw lots of doctors and that #8217;s when I found out I was hypo. Can #8217;t say I know what helped it go away other than time and levo. I get palpitations (which are different) now but that seems related to drinking alcohol before bed, etc. When my levo dose was too high a few years ago I did end up in the ER because I felt like I was having a heart attack, but that was a different sensation from pvc or palps. Hope the right levo dose helps it go away.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I #8217;ve had stomach problems since starting AIP. My digestion was GREAT before. Got worse when I went GF and is still not great on AIP (diarrhea some days) but TBH I #8217;m not 100.00% compliant. I suspected it was the increase in nuts I was eating while I was GF and on AIP I #8217;ve been eating more dried fruits (figs and dates like you) and a ton more coconut - milk w/out guar gum and chips. So I #8217;m experimenting with keto AIP to avoid overdosing on sugar and also cutting down on the coconut.</TEXT>

    <TITLE>Reacting to nuts</TITLE>
    <DATE>2019-04-23 14:01:17</DATE>
    <TEXT>This may be a really stupid question but... do I have to avoid nuts completely if I have an  #8220;itchy mouth #8221; reaction to them upon reintroduction? I love nuts and used to eat a lot of them but NOT peanuts because I know now I am sensitive to them (itchy mouth and more). After cutting nuts out for over a month I #8217;ve tried them twice and twice have gotten a mild itchy mouth/tongue reaction. I would like to eat just two Brazil nuts a day for the selenium (I am hypothyroid) but since I am getting this immediate reaction I #8217;m assuming I should avoid nuts completely in case they are doing more systemic damage, right?</TEXT>

I #8217;m undiagnosed (waiting on second set of MRI results) but ended up having an episode of excruciating chest pain (went to urgent care then two different ERs in one night, literally crawling on all fours onto elevator). Had follow up with cardio and lots of tests but heart was fine (duh). The episode lasted probably 12 hours and was the most pain I #8217;ve ever felt besides childbirth. Felt like all my internal organs were being squeezed tight, had weird trapped air burping, and just unbelievable pain. Afterward I thought it might have been a reaction to my levo dose being a little too high but it wasn #8217;t that high and that doesn #8217;t really make sense to me now...</TEXT>

I #8217;m wondering if the increase in avocados, cauliflower, beets, etc. I #8217;m eating recently could be affecting me and I #8217;m considering switching elimination diets! I already 100% avoid alliums because they cause migraines/fatigue/fog. Edited to add: I was checked for celiac (negative) but am nonetheless gluten free. I also take a B complex with B12 and have my levels checked. And I #8217;m treated for hypothyroid and levels are within range. Have also ruled out major autoimmune disorders including MS through extensive testing.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I have no experience with chiropractic but I #8217;m curious about the effect of cervical spine alignment on thyroid function. If your thyroid is  #8220;restricted #8221; by a bulging disc or otherwise  #8220;crowded #8221; by, say, reverse lordosis (neck that curves backward) could it become under active? I #8217;m sure this sounds stupid/crazy when I say it out loud but I have been searching for years for the root cause of my hypothyroidism (does not appear to be autoimmune) and recently learned from an MRI that I have reverse cervical lordosis, mild disc bulge at C5/C6 and a  #8220;small thyroid #8221;. Probably just coincidence but I am prone to crazy health rabbit holes in an attempt to find a way to feel better (TSH treated and in range but still symptomatic).</TEXT>

They vary widely but common ones are a band of shimmering, jagged colors/lights interrupting your vision, or blind or blurry spots or other visual weirdness.

    <TEXT>Yes I think it #8217;s normal for a new maintenance med. After a few weeks on a new daily dose you should have your levels rechecked to make sure its the right dose. Your doctor should also check with you about your symptoms. As long as you #8217;re feeling better and your levels are in range, you will likely get ongoing refills after the first month or two.</TEXT>

    <TITLE>Levo and caffeine timing</TITLE>
    <DATE>2019-06-22 12:58:48</DATE>
    <TEXT>I #8217;ve seen various suggestions about when to take levo in relation to food and caffeine. I know empty stomach is best and at least an hour (or 4?) before caffeine. What about breakfast? I #8217;ve been drinking coffee upon waking (necessary), waiting an hour to take levo on an empty stomach, then waiting at least 30 minutes to eat and another 3O minutes before a second cup of coffee (also necessary at the moment). So technically I #8217;m taking the pill on a empty stomach but after a dose of caffeine an hour before. For years I didn #8217;t pay attention to timing and took levo or Armour with coffee and breakfast. What I #8217;m doing now is what works for me in terms of my caffeine habits but I #8217;m wondering if I should really be taking the levo an hour *before* any coffee for optimal absorption. Anyone have ideas? I don #8217;t see an endo just my PCP and she doesn #8217;t get into these details... Thanks!</TEXT>

    <TEXT>72 hour water fast, at hour 62 Coffee, tea and electrolyte drops I #8217;m fasting for weight loss and autophagy. I #8217;d like to make this a regular practice to mitigate a long list of health and cosmetic concerns. I #8217;ve been keto for 6 weeks (with a few vacation treats right before I started the fast) and would like to start IF/OMAD when I #8217;m done. I did the Prolon FMD once a year ago and this feels similar. I have a rare weekend home alone (without kids) and I #8217;m very glad to be alone with few obligations because I can just rest and binge Netflix (Great British Baking Show of all things). I #8217;m not sure how I would handle this if I had to be more active - maybe it would be distracting and therefore easier? I feel physically drained but not hungry. I #8217;m not actually looking forward to eating. It feels like it will be an unpleasant shock to the system.

    <TEXT>15 hours into a 46 hour water fast. I have been struggling with 16/8 and 18/6 and had hoped to transition to OMAD by now after a 69 hour water fast two weeks ago. Kids are away for one night so I #8217;m grabbing this opportunity. I don #8217;t know how to explain to them why I #8217;m skipping dinner otherwise (they are 4 and 7) without giving them confusing messages about food and eating. I have a history of disordered eating and after being in such a good place before and after the last water fast, IF seems to be triggering overeating for me. I #8217;d like to  #8220;reset #8221; my hunger cues. I want to fast regularly for the health benefits, for the autophagy to protect against aging, inflammation and disease. I #8217;d also like my skin to clear up (melasma, KP, rosacea, flat warts, etc). I would love to go long enough someday for the arthritic pain that #8217;s starting in my fingers (I #8217;m 45 F) to disappear. My parents have both been severely debilitated at a relatively young age with multiple auto-immune conditions. I also have hypothyroidism and one brain lesion consistent with MS that has me freaked out. AND I have 15 lbs to lose. Lost 7 last fast but gained 5 back. I plan to do a 3-5 day water fast next month and the month after. Then switch to once a quarter. I think I will try 5:2 (low carb and gluten free, as I do now) for the rest of the time, which would be 5 days a week of IF and 2 non-consecutive days with OMAD of 500 cals, low carb and low protein...</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I made it past 36 hours on a water fast and will break the fast sometime this morning or afternoon. Ideally I #8217;d do 48 hours but that would end me at 7:30pm which is when I usually stop eating on IF and I need to give my body more time to ease back into eating before the work week. Yesterday was harder than I expected and it was very hard to sleep last night but I feel much better this morning. Having black cold brew coffee and feel like I could keep going indefinitely! I #8217;m amazed at everyone who can do EF for 5+ days (I #8217;ve only done 3 days once recently) and glad to have had this practice. I will try more 36-48 hours so I can build up to 5 days.

    <TEXT>36 hours into a 5(?) day water fast. May break at 45 hours for a social gathering (BBQ) that I don #8217;t want to be weird about. Then back into 72 hours before another social event. Why? A myriad of health concerns. Primarily want to get rid of the arthritic pain starting in my hands (45F) but also concerned about skin issues, allergies, protecting against aging-related disease, neuro-degeneration, etc. I also have about 15lbs I #8217;d like to lose but am trying to focus on health first and not fixate on weight loss. I feel great! Though it was hard to sleep last night and I had intense dreams. Planning to stick to black coffee, lemon water, electrolytes and herbal tea.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Day One of a 71 hour water fast. I usually do IF with one 41 hour fast per week for general health and weight loss. This week is a tough one and I #8217;m caught in a stress eating cycle. I want to break that cycle and take comfort in the profound peace I feel during an extended fast. I look forward to breaking the fast and celebrating the end of this difficult week on Friday. My motivation feels shakier than usual though and I #8217;m a little worried that for the first time I #8217;m choosing fasting as a reaction to stress instead of for the health benefits. It reminds me of ED behavior which I have a long ago history of. I don #8217;t want to be turning to fasting as a psychological salve or attempt to control my world when it feels out of control.

    <TEXT>Day 4 water/coffee fast. Will break fast this morning or afternoon for 83-90 total hours. I feel great. It #8217;s my longest fast recently and so satisfying to make it here. I made a pasta and meatball dinner for family and friends last night and had a La Croix while they ate and I tried to answer my friend #8217;s questions about why I #8217;m fasting so long. I have to admit I was googling around yesterday to try to find how long you *really* have to fast to get the immune benefits. I think the answer is we don #8217;t really know since studies are mostly in mice and yeast? but Valter Longo says humans should go at least 4-5 days so here I am. I had to taste a speck of plain tomato sauce while I was cooking yesterday for saltiness. About an hour later I noticed a flair up of an allergic rash I get on my elbows and chest (usually a gluten reaction). I #8217;ve also noticed after shorter fasts that I have a mild allergic reaction to nuts. FARG. Nightshades I can handle avoiding but I don #8217;t think I can live without nuts. I already eat low carb and avoid peanuts, gluten and garlic and onions. I #8217;ve been hoping fasting can help alleviate my various food intolerances in the end. I love food but a lot of it makes me feel like crap  #128553;</TEXT>

Really struggled with cravings at dinner time yesterday while cooking for my family but told myself  #8220;it comes in waves, this will pass #8221; and it sure did. I was looking forward to feeling good this AM, drinking black coffee and having no hunger and here I am! It really does get easier the more your body gets used to it. Going to stick to this once a week plus another ADF day of 500 cals or less (F/45/5 #8217;6 #8221;/136lbs) with EF every three months. Goals are clearing up various symptoms, preventing disease and losing like 10 more lbs.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>ADF twice a week. 47 hours this time, 11 hours in. It seems to get easier each time? I just have to ride the wave of hunger that comes at dinner while I make cheeseburgers for my kids. I was feeling good last week but the rebound eating last weekend was BAD. I honestly still feel full days later. Tracking calories is too triggering for me so OMAD may be my best option for the days I eat. Fasting feels easier than eating sometimes. Goals: disease prevention, clearing up symptoms, weight loss. Decided to only weigh myself once a week. I was getting too obsessed with scale numbers and my RENPHO app. 10lbs to lose but there #8217;s no rush... UPDATE: welp I did a sanity check and quit at 20 hrs. Realized I was feeling and sounding a bit disordered... I have a long/long-ago history of ED and did not come this far to give myself another eating disorder. This is about health after all! One full day (40-46 hrs) a week is plenty on top of IF and EF with my stats.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Yep. I am hypo (not hashi) and a GF diet dramatically improved my overall well being. No more fatigue brain fog migraines skin rash etc. At the same time I went GF I also changed the way I take my levo dose (away from caffeine which can decrease absorption) and my latest TSH level was much lower (almost too low) than it #8217;s ever been on the same dose. I wondered if the GF diet helped that or just the caffeine adjustment. In any case, I notice when I accidentally have gluten because I get a rash but also nausea, brain fog etc. Edit to add: I have also tested negative for celiac.</TEXT>

A few months ago I started waiting an hour after I had caffeine to take my pill, then waiting another hour before any more caffeine. My levels really changed!

    <TEXT>I used to have BED (have been free of it for around a decade) and have been doing IF and EF for the last six months. At first it was easy and I lost weight but then I think my body  #8220;noticed #8221; and this triggered binge eating again. Such a bummer after believing I was finally free of an awful, awful eating disorder. It really sucks because I #8217;m committed to IF and EF for disease prevention and longevity more than weight loss. My only advice, which I #8217;m trying to give myself, is to NOT push yourself too hard or double down when you aren #8217;t seeing results. I think that #8217;s the ED mentality that can trap you in a downward spiral. IMHO, counting calories is impossible for those with a history of eating disorders. OMAD may be a useful tool but not if you don #8217;t eat enough or are too strict about it or use it as a punishment. Does that make sense? I #8217;m trying to regroup after weeks of binges and think my path forward is to do what is easy and comfortable (for me that #8217;s 16:8) and not push for OMAD or regular 40+ hour fasts until the binge monster relaxes. Good luck to you!</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I have been reading this thread all morning and not 15 minutes ago I learned the proper way to use those tree-shaped car air fresheners. According to the packaging, you open the top of the plastic bag and expose the tip of the tree only (first set of  #8220;branches #8221;). Each week, as the scent wears out, you expose a little more of the tree. This way it lasts 7 weeks and isn #8217;t obnoxiously overpowering like it is if you pull the whole thing out and hang it completely exposed on your rear view mirror!</TEXT>

    <TEXT>35 hours water fasting. Having black coffee now and will end at 42-45 hours. Haven #8217;t fasted past 20 hours since before Thanksgiving. Before that I was sick for several weeks so I didn #8217;t do any overnight fasts. Now I #8217;ve undone my (minor) weight loss so need to get back on track. I was daunted and almost gave in while feeding my kids dinner Last night but was able to remind myself that the hunger comes in waves, is always strongest at dinner time and would be gone by the time I woke up. And here I am! Planning my next extended fast of 5 days after Christmas. Autophagy and disease prevention is number one, weight loss a nice bonus.</TEXT>

Expecting to drink black coffee, tea, lemon juice, ACV, salt and electrolytes. Will break fast with a Christmas Eve dinner which I #8217;ll cook for family. Need to get myself into the right mindset. I #8217;ve been stress eating and drinking since Thanksgiving. Edit: I can #8217;t do math early in the morning. It will be 5 days until Xmas eve! So planning 118 hours (not 94), my longest ever. May still stick to 94 hours to break fast carefully before feast.</TEXT>

Weight loss will be good too because in the last month I #8217;m sure I #8217;ve gained back what I lost from when I started fasting this summer (only 6-8lbs). In the new year I plan to keep doing one 47hr fast per week and one 5 day fast every 3 months. Keto and mild CICO for further health benefits. 46F and my new motto is exercise is not optional. I would like to lose 20-25lbs but health is my focus now, not weight, so I will weigh myself less often (love my RENPHO scale)</TEXT>

    <TEXT>TL/DR: diagnosed with my second case of shingles in 3 months but only had one blister on the opposite side from previous rash. Took antivirals right away and rash never grew or spread and I had no nerve pain. Other symptoms were ongoing low grade fever and painful swollen glands in my neck (nowhere near my blister). Was I misdiagnosed? My first case of shingles was 3 months ago. Classic pain first then obvious rash, took antivirals and it slowly resolved. I was incredibly lucky that the nerve pain was never that bad. Then a week or so ago I noticed I had a low grade fever after minor surgery for a ventral hernia. Also aches and pains but not in the same area as the first case of shingles. Checked with surgeon - no infection. Developed painful swollen glands in my neck a few days later which my ENT thought was some kind of infection. Started antibiotics then woke up the next day with an open blister that looked/felt like the start of a shingles rash in the same area as my first rash but across the midline. Went to urgent care immediately and they agreed with me, gave me antivirals. I stopped the antibiotics. Since then the rash hasn #8217;t developed at all and I haven #8217;t had any pain that corresponds. It #8217;s hard to believe this is shingles unless it #8217;s a very mild case?</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I have a long past history of disordered eating and while I #8217;ve had success with IF and extended fasting I do find it triggers periods of bingeing. This has led me to regain the small amount of weight I lost initially. FWIW I do not eat junk food and eat carefully even when I binge (worst vices are raw nuts, hard cheeses, avocado, that sort of thing). I #8217;m not sure how to get past this. I have tried easing up and skipping longer or extended fasts for awhile while sticking to my baseline of 16:8 but even then I find binge behavior creeping in. The health benefits of fasting are so important to me to stave off age-related disease based on my genetics that I don #8217;t want to give it up completely. I #8217;ve also tried keto and CICO but those are way too triggering. I think my only advice is to ease up on the restrictions when binges flare up as opposed to doubling down. In my experience this approach is the only way out of an eating disorder. Easier said than done of course but maybe I need to take my own advice and take a break for now...</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Nice! How did you manage to avoid bingeing? What did you eat and did you restrict your window at all on those two days?</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Thanks for the tip! Very helpful right about now. From what I understand rolling 72s is a 72 hr fast, then eat one meal and go straight back into another 72 hour fast. Now that I write that down it sounds extreme... I guess another option is rolling 48s.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Hour 35 of 71. It #8217;s not much but I #8217;ve been struggling for months to get back to this. Such a relief to be on the other side of the first 24 hours. I feel pretty dizzy this morning and my 5-year-old has been waking me up all night so I #8216;m sucking down black coffee now. Hoping to go for a run before everyone else wakes up.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Hour 60/70. Almost there. Second night of sleep was rough. Heart pounding and hard to sleep. Got some insight though in the middle of the night. Looking at my fasting and weight history over the last year I noticed that weight loss was slow but going in the right direction when I was doing 20-23 hours per day with one 40-42 per week. When I stopped the weekly 40s and my daily fasts crept back to 16 or 18, my weight started going in the wrong direction. It #8217;s obvious of course that less fasted hours would lead to less weight loss and even gain, but it was helpful to see the charts and graphs showing me that trend. This fast has taught me that I can do 40-48 at least once a week again and can stick to OMAD the rest of the time. Thank you fasting.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I wonder too. I #8217;m anxious to get this weight off but also want a sustainable habit. Maybe a few 72s once in awhile mixed in with 48s. Honestly now that I #8217;m at 65 hours I really feel like I could keep going!!</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I am similar to you. 46. Peri but not confirmed with my doc. Hormones were checked awhile ago and were  #8220;borderline #8221;. In the last month my period has gone MIA (has been all over the place for the last two years - early, late, heavy, light, short, long, spotting, sometimes cramps, sometimes sore breasts) and the hot flashes and night sweats have become constant. I went through a few rounds of thinning hair but that seems to have stabilized for now. Insomnia has ticked up too lately. The hot flashes bother me most. Just a sudden fire out of the blue burning from the inside out and pouring sweat. Doesn #8217;t help that the weather is extra hot right now. I #8217;m here to commiserate and learn more about HRT. Edit to add: I #8217;ve always battled with about 10-20 extra pounds and gained 10 more lbs during quarantine but suddenly my weight seems to be creeping up again, all in belly fat :(</TEXT>

    <TEXT>OMG I live in fear of the dreaded  #8220;pine mouth #8221;. When I first encountered it 10 or so years ago I remember hearing that it was caused by cheap imported nuts that had suddenly entered the US market. Not sure if that turned out to be true or not but I am so scared of getting it again that I avoid all pine nuts and only eat homemade pesto made with walnuts. It is worse than losing your sense of taste or smell! Nothing helps and it lasts 24/7 for weeks *shudder*</TEXT>
