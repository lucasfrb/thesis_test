    <TITLE>alien family in the sims</TITLE>
    <DATE>2019-02-04 15:55:24</DATE>
    <TEXT>i had a male sim who was abducted by aliens alot and came back pregnant multiple times, and eventually had 3 alien kids ( all boys) . later there was an adult alien in the yard scanning the metrorites i places there . i made my sim talk and flirt with her , some time later they got married and i found out 2 of the alien kids where from her (i never found out who the other parent was of the other kid). when they got married both my sim and the alien were elderly , not even 5 minutes after the wedding the alien sim died. so later my sim fell in love with someone else and i made him get married again and then he got accused of cheating on his dead wife! i thought it was pretty odd cuz she was dead but he is still known as a cheater now.  #8203; edit: i forgot to mention that i put the wifes gravestone of the wife next to the house and made that part infrond of it flowers and the a meteriorite hit that part of the house and the grave stone disappeared and i could not get it back. im pretty sure the alien kids ( who were adults by then) didnt do it but it really sucked and srsly made me upset</TEXT>

    <TEXT>So me and my friends always talk about going to partys and clubs once we are 18 and who is gonna be who, like she will be flirting with everyone, she will be driving us all and stay sober and she will be the drunk girl crying in the bathroom ect. One of my friends said she doesnt want us to drink alcohol or do drugs, not even weed, infrond of her. She mainly meant this towards me cuz im always talking about wanting to try alcohol and weed. So on my bucket list is going to a rave, and that friend said she wanted to go with me if i did go...a rave....where something that is done alot , is drugs.... so I think she didnt fully knew what happens in a rave, like i wont do any drugs other then weed , and i wont do any drug if some stranger on a rave gives it to me . but there is gonna be alot of people who will do drugs and if she doesnt want to see that then it isnt a smart idea for her to go.</TEXT>

    <TITLE>My French teacher was the worst teacher i #8217;ve ever had</TITLE>
    <DATE>2019-06-17 18:26:44</DATE>
    <TEXT>(This is a long story )( and im not sure if this counts as a personal attack against my french teacher since personal attacks are against the rules ) First year of high school (12-13years old, i live in the netherlands so we have a different school system) we had a lot of french teachers , one was really nice , one was not mean but kinda bad at teaching and one was just a jackass, atleast thats how i saw him. i have dyslexia so i have a lot of trouble with other languages that aren #8217;t English or dutch. So why i didn #8217;t like him that year was because he gave me and half of the class detention because we had a bad grade, which isnt why i was so mad, all he did was just telling us we didnt study (while most of us did! i know those kids and we really tried but just have a lot of trouble with it) and he was just laughing at us! If he would have just talked to us and asked if we didnt study or if we just had trouble with it and give us tips on how to study i wouldn #8217;t have been so mad. So i really didn #8217;t like him, the year after we had this woman and she was really nice . (So i have a lot of mental issues now/in highschool and he only made it worse which i will explain in the this part) So in the third year(14-15 year old) we had him again. I was still mad at him and didn #8217;t believe he would have chanced in just 1 or 2 years. I was right. He was awful, he put a lot of pressure on us, we would have to learn a lot of words and if you even got as much as 2 wrong you got detention and would have to write all words 40 times with translation. This made a lot of us stress out. I was still scared if i failed a test i would get detention and he would just laugh at me again. So after the first french lesson of that year i already came home stressed out, this went on for weeks and my stress turned into anxiety. I cried the most days before french just looking at list of words we had to learn and just cry for 2 hours cuz i couldn #8217;t remember them and i was so stressed out and anxious. Everytime after french class i ran to the bathrooms to cry and then went to the frontdesk to ask if i could go home for the day cuz i didnt feel well. So i started to feel really depressed again and had anxiety attacks because of his classes so i decided to go back to therapy. Something the french teacher said a lot was: #8221; the stress you have is your own fault  #8220; he didn #8217;t say this to me personally but to the whole class, this did piss me off cuz i have mental disorders that mostly caused my stress and he made me feel like its my fault. Other stuff he said was  #8220; making fun of each other and laughing at each other is not allowed #8221; which i thought was a bit hypocritical seeing how he laughed at us last year And he said if you had detention to write those words 40 times that  #8220;i will be greeting you with a smile #8221; My thought at that moment was #8221; dont you mean laughing at us? #8221; And something else he said was  #8220; and we would still be friends  #8220; and i was like  #8220; thats a one sided friendship then #8221; i was still really mad at him I talked to someone higher up about his methods of teaching how much this stressed out the students and that teacher talked to the french teacher and he didn #8217;t do the detention thing anymore which helped a little bit but i still feel anxious in his classes . We had test week and with the french test i had a panic attack and started hyperventilating, so i had to leave the classroom, i failed the test with a 1,2 and i didnt even want to retake the test I told this to a friend who is in a different class and they said they had the same thing. They also always cried after french and got a lot of detention from that guy just for having trouble with french . I used to love french music but now i feel lowkey anxious everytime i hear french, i guess it really effected me .</TEXT>

    <DATE>2019-06-20 12:57:50</DATE>
    <TEXT>So basically the class was pretty loud, so i asked if i could sit in the hallway, turns out there were already around 8 people sitting there, so i sit at the empty table and these 3 girls sit down at the same table as me , they were studying for a test where they have to talk in english or french , but they stopped pretty soon and just started talking about bs, then 2 of their friends come and now they wont shut the fuck up while im trying to study! You aren #8217;t allowed to be in the hallways just to chill , you have to work or the teacher will probably send you away. Edit: they just left and then they came back and sat at this table again while there is an empty table not even a 2 meters away, i have alot of stuff , they dont , guess im gonna have to move with all my stuff Second edit : when they got send away by the teacher they wanted to have a discussion with him... wow...

    <DATE>2020-02-17 16:50:52</DATE>
    <TEXT>So there was this show , i think it was from disney. It probably aired after 2007. I live in the netherlands but i think the show was american and just dubbed in dutch. It was about 3 teens who are monster hunters. I think 2 guys and 1 girl ( not sure) in the intro they said something like  #8220; remember when you told your parents there was a monster under your bed but when they looked that nothing was there? There really was a monster #8221; or something in that sense. I remember there being a creature in a box they took with them that they would use to erase the memories of bystanders who saw them fight monsters . It would erase people their memories by screaming. And in one episode the creature bit one of the guys their neck and the bite mark became a bump and eventually another one of those creatures came out of the bump . And one of the guys fell in love with a girl who was actually a monster . This is all i can remember , i will update if I remember more .</TEXT>

Or because i have a preference for men in general ( which is starting to change, sometimes i feel like i like women more then men , it changes from time to time , so bi-cycle i guess...) how do i accept myself more and stop feeling invalid ?</TEXT>

    <TEXT>So you dont feel sexual attraction , do you still kiss someone you date or is that also something you dont really feel the need for ? Do you also not make out with someone you date, as in , does that fall under the sexual attraction you dont feel? ( you still date people right? Only in a romantic way and without the sexual part , unless you are aromantic as well ) basically does kissing fall under the absent sexual attraction ? I dont know much about asexuality and im just trying to learn more about it so would appreciate all the information you could give me!! Im just trying to get educated Thanks in advance .</TEXT>
