    <TEXT>Yes. If you have a RGH/JTAG modchip then you can just put any 2tb hdd into your 360. It's just a simple step to format it in the Microsoft Dashboard. If you don't have a modchip it can still be done by hacking the hard drive so it identifies as a standard xbox 360 hard drive, but that's probably complicated and wouldn't work on all drives. Also you can buy a new 360 internal hard drive enclosure on eBay or Amazon for 5-10 dollars.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>The 360 had wired controllers, other than cheap third-party options? I thought they were all wireless and you would just use a long charge cable if you killed the battery. I've never seen an official 360 wired controller in the wild, at least not that I have had nor did my friends. I had friends with cheap aftermarket wired controllers, though.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Why the alternate account? I'll just assume it's for multiplayer as it probably won't matter. I assume that yes it works the same on XB360 and XBOne. If you own both accounts then I see no reason not to keep both accounts on all your consoles. The purchases are tied to the account of purchase, but other accounts can access the purchased content if the other accounts are on the same console. There may be limits imposed by Microsoft in extreme cases, but normally you'll be just fine in normal use scenarios.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I'd just double check that light color. Is the console light green and the controller light solid green on any port indicator? If so then yeah the xbox 360 is indeed working just fine, you better double check the input selection on the TV and the HDMI cable. If you have different lights on the console or the controller is flashing then you have a problem with the console.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I rather like having content downloaded onto the system. It's safe, cause it's saved. Hard drives and flash media still outlast DVDs. I actually really liked the rumored no optical media xbone. Not the execution of the idea, but the rumor, because part of the rumor was that Microsoft was going to give digital copies for some games if you turned in the optical media. Of course they didn't do that. I was, however, ready to hit the gamestop and buy up dozens or maybe hundreds of scratched games to perminantly link them to my account.</TEXT>

I can't ever recall them turning down food for anything except sugar content. Update: I looked it up, and like 95% of what I typically eat is already diabetic friendly food. Also Lemon herb chicken with a side of asparagus and red pepper was on the WestJet menu! That's like THE recommended meal for a diabetic according to most health websites.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Modded Warfare on YouTube has many guides, but most guides, including his, are somewhat outdated. Basically, once you have dashlaunch and the Aurora dashboard you're pretty much all set. Get games in GOD format or rip them directly from the MS dashboard. Configure dashlaunch for liveblock, and autofake, but not livestrong as that will prevent your dashboard from downloading game assets. Some people still prefer FSD3, I think aurora presents a better interface. I can tell you that you that an unofficial update to the backwards compatibility files needed to play xbox original titles was released on 02 November 2019. It's on twitter and is based on the official 2018 backwards compatibility. This unofficial update is for developer and modified consoles. Also, avoid plug-ins. There's some for stealth live services which may be helpful for playing online. However, many are known to cause issues with certain games. This includes the Nova plugin in Aurora and the FSD3 plugin. Disable them.</TEXT>

There is no fancy homebrew and you can't run kodi. If you try running too many plug-ins then you're just going to find some games fail to run. I even disable the Nova plugin in Aurora.

    <TEXT>I'm sure there are exceptions, but I work alongside some of the cops I'm talking about, and they are in fact getting paid for police work while sitting at many road construction sites. So, you're kind of but not completely wrong. Though off duty police do work security, there are uniform restrictions and allowances. Which is why you see the cops working off duty directing traffic for a church in uniform, because they are directing traffic. Also those police vehicles are paid for with our tax dollars. The gas they run on was also paid for by our tax dollars.</TEXT>

But where would hip-hop be without a pasty white kid, like Marshal Mathers, thinking he could appropriate the culture and rise to be an icon in that industry. You can hate on all the laughable posers, or just brush them off. The Hawaiian culture is historically similar enough for that analogy, (I believe Elvis Presley would be comparable) but I worry my point could be equally lost.</TEXT>

I think it's tacky, but my opinion isn't what matters. I was making a point that your brainwashing won't let you comprehend. It's all yin and yang, maybe you should appropriate some Toaism into your life and then you can understand. Does a Christian wallow in misery when someone appropriates Christian culture and values into their life? Does Krishna shame you for appropriating the mantras, dress, and practices of theirs? I'm not trying to be combative, but you're focusing on what you have been brainwashed to believe over the reality of life.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>At Level 37 I have unlocked many skills on the information technology skill tree. These skills were built into the template I used in the early stages. Many side missions have provided nice rewards, and I've unlocked some nice locations. It took some time, but I am back on to completing my main story mission now. Sadly, my character build has had a lot of nerfed abilities. Also after the the starter quest completion I had major issues with griefers to the point where I wasn't able to farm the skill points I needed to progress. Ask me, the devs need to nerf the abuse of power perk and that would fix the griefer problem significantly. I tend to use a lot of buffs and proc abilities in regular gameplay. For example, my personality level is average, but I have found the potions to buff this are quite prevalent in the meta. Some of best proc abilities, like getting laid, are proc'd much more easily with these buffs (also by leveling your companion affinity).</TEXT>

    <TEXT>You need more credit, or higher limits on the cards you have. Don't open more than 2 new accounts per year, and don't have more than 3-4 active credit cards in total. Accept any offered credit increases on these cards, as long as they don't start charging you a fee. In a few years diversify your credit with a car loan or mortgage as that's a bonus too. I suggest a card with a good cash back deal. Read the fine print and pay off all your purchases twice a month to ensure that you don't pay interest. Use a card like cash, and keep your cash as a buffer of at least 2x whatever you spend on the card. So if you have 1000 in the bank, spend at most 500. A few years ago I opened up a Discover card with 5% cash back, with a special offer so they match the cash back you earned. I paid no fees, but I made over 800 in cash back, which I used to pay off my card. You can even buy Amazon gift cards at the grocery store and make 10% back if you do it right. Now I have a credit limit 4x what they started me with, and 1/3 my annual salary on that one card alone.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>It's better most of the time. Only exception I know is Alien Isolation, which should be either extracted or copied from the original disc using the Microsoft NXE dashboard. It's better because all the game data is neatly contained in a package, one formatted to take up less space on the disk. Remember, the xbox uses a version of FAT, but with a larger cluster size. Meaning every file has a min size and must be padded to accommodate the file system. If you have lots of small files you will lose lots of space. Each file in a GOD is already the perfect size to not waste any cluster space. There are other reasons, but that could be a significant source of wasted space. You also don't have to worry about multiple game discs, like ever, if using GOD. Just put both discs in the same folder and it just works.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>People in Earth 2.0 use actual terms of appreciation instead of the meaningless blanket "Thank you" term. "thank you" is what a cashier says to you, it's not a personal term. People in Earth 2.0 only say "sorry" sparingly, as opposed to every other sentence like how some people say it.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>That guy in the video clearly has no experience. If he had experience he would know that river can only be passed by a transformer, and he ain't no Optimus Prime. There was this jeep trail in Colorado, often a stream was running through the road. I remember many times it was little more than a ditch, sometimes it would be 30 feet across. The runoff from the winter always caused it to swell, and when the road was open in the winter it would still flow or freeze over. Many times I turned back if it was bad, but a few occasions I had water halfway up the tires. I even had the tires covered in the middle of the stream on one occasion. Scary shit. But, I built up years of experience before I ever tried anything extreme.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>The parks are closed to the public. I say let the homeless have the space without harassing them to move to more populated areas. Since they are most likely to get infected without getting tested, it would be an act of immense stupidity to ticket them for being isolated in the parks. So, of course they're the ones racking up the tickets.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I don't see the relevance of this meme with socialism. You pay taxes because that's one of many ways to contribute to society. A socialist believes that they should contribute to build a better society. If you don't contribute to society in one form or fashion then you are practically an anarchist. Even capitalists have their philanthropists.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Raspberry pi is a terrible option. It may work for a while, but you're going to be at 100% cpu every time it has to transcode a single video, also the ethernet and USB ports share the same USB 2.0 bus, so good luck trying to get 2-3 simultaneous streams. Pi4 is better, but still a poor choice. Odds are that you can find a working computer dumped outside someone's home that would work better. Or pay a few bucks for a college surplus pc, or hit up Craigslist.</TEXT>
