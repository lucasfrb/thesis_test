    <TEXT>When I studied abroad i was able to get several months worth of birth control pills to take with me, but my insurance would not cover the rest. I had three more months mailed to me from the states, and honestly i had no issues with it. It just took a long time to arrive.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I #8217;m in Versailles but idk the town/schools i #8217;ll be in yet. I #8217;m just kind of going nuts because I haven #8217;t danced all summer and I #8217;m a classical ballet dancer, so now i #8217;m feeling super out of practice. I danced with a pro company called Ballet Preljocaj last time i lived in france, but i was in aix en provence. I #8217;m just super afraid I #8217;ll get placed in a super small town with no dance/gyms around</TEXT>

    <TEXT>things i #8217;m glad i brought: a portable phone charger!! essential for when you #8217;re traveling. 1 of your favorite nail polishes and skincare- this stuff can get really expensive in france for some reason. also a small wallet that can fit in your front pocket to avoid pickpocketing, plus a theft resistant backpack (mine has special lock zippers and a pocket against your back for wallet). a scarf that can double as a blanket for travel, airpods, extra chargers for everything, a locker lock for when staying at hostels, cold medicine, a few big ziploc bags for storage. make sure all purses you bring can zip shut. practical shoes for walking really far, and maybe one or two pairs of going out shoes! also sunglasses, regular glasses (if you need them) and copies of ALL of your prescription meds</TEXT>

    <TEXT>last time i got a visa i went to atlanta and their office was a nightmare. they had some sort of incident where someone was smoking drugs or something in the bulding, made us all evacuate in the middle of my appointment, waited outside for FOUR HOURS and finally they came out and were like  #8220;lol sorry you #8217;ll have to reschedule. #8221; I had driven five hours there for my appointment and taken off work and had to go back again a few weeks later. absolutely terrible experience lol</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Hi guys, this is just a heads up. I went to my visa appointment in nyc today and they refused to let me have my meeting because i havent been quarantined in nyc for 14 days. i spent $1000 traveling for nothing. if you #8217;re from a high risk state coming to nyc they will deny your appointment unless you #8217;ve quarantined there. i even tried to lie and say i #8217;d been in nyc for two weeks but they ask for evidence (flight/hotel/air bnb receipt). also tried explaining that i had been quarantined at my home in sc before coming AND that i had covid two months ago and literally couldn #8217;t get it again yet, but they didn #8217;t care. needless to say if you #8217;re young and poor and need an appointment in nyc you #8217;re fucked. also they didn #8217;t even mention in my confirmation letter/email that the 14 days was required. good luck everyone else lol.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Thrifting is honestly really big there. They have a pretty big chain called American Vintage ironically with shops all over Paris/elsewhere. Really nice true vintage clothes, but can be a little pricier than second hand stores in the US. Your clothes/style can be a good conversation starter and a way to make friends, so it #8217;s nice to hunt around for unique pieces :)</TEXT>
