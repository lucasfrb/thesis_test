    <TEXT>Same. The last time I read the whole series was when 7 came out, and I #8217;m holding off reading again until I #8217;ve forgotten so much that it will feel fresh and new again. Gotta say it #8217;s pretty easy to forget a lot if you wait 10+ years and read a ton of more complex series in the scifi/fantasy genre over that period. I #8217;m hoping I #8217;ll be able to read it fresh again once the 20th anniversary of the 7th book comes about  #129310;</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Hey I #8217;ve been there! Didn #8217;t read for fun (well, unless you count me finding my research fun lol, but I mean for pleasure outside of academia) while getting my degree in Latin. It took a while and some serious persistence, but I was able to get myself back into it this past year! Now I #8217;m a reading junky again lol, though sadly I still don #8217;t read the same amount as I did prior to university.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I haven #8217;t experienced the exact same thing, but I have experienced something similar. Being raised that dating men = gay = bad, I had a really freaking hard time accepting when my sexuality suddenly shifted towards 75% interest in men. Even though I don #8217;t actually harbor any homophobia, and I also know that I #8217;m a woman so dating a man is straight anyway, I still feel that internalized  #8220;dating men = bad #8221; socialization that I had. What I #8217;ve found helpful is a lot of time and some serious soul searching (which may or may not have been aided by various substances). I #8217;ve gotten to the point now where those feelings, though still present, are much more subdued than before, and it #8217;s very freeing. I can only imagine that this will continue over time. Maybe you just need to do the same and give it time and some serious thought.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>It #8217;s a book I #8217;m very interested in getting a hold of and reading because of how much controversy it seems to whip up every couple of years when I hear about it. I have heard the cliffnotes on what it says about race and IQ, and I don #8217;t believe in the claims it is supposedly making (I say supposedly because I haven #8217;t read it myself, so I #8217;m not sure what claims it does or does not directly make, as there also appears to be a lot of hyperbole around the subject, as evidenced by this very situation). I promise I #8217;m far from the only person with this same mindset, I know tons and tons of people who share it with me.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>12 Rules for Life by Jordan Peterson comes to mind. I never finished it (the stress of it being found got to me), but when I was reading it I couldn #8217;t tell anyone or show it off. I went and saw the guy lecture at my university too just as he was blowing up, because who in the hell would turn away an opportunity to see a rising thinker with millions upon millions of admirers give an academic lecture. That was entirely in secret too, and the organizers at the university held it in a building off to the side and out of the way at a late hour to avoid protests. I gotta say, I don #8217;t agree with the guy on a lot, but he #8217;s an interesting thinker, and it gets my gears going as I try to grapple with what I do and do not disagree with. Idk though, I guess I #8217;m a sexist transphobic fascist now or something  #129300; My new mindset as of the past couple months is  #8220;fuck it #8221; though. I #8217;m done worrying about what  #8216;my friends #8217; will think is wrong to read. If they #8217;re incapable of being friends with someone who isn #8217;t afraid to read things that they might disagree with, to the point that they #8217;ll stop talking to me, they weren #8217;t good friends anyway.</TEXT>

I always purchase books I read, I never check them out, so if it #8217;s on my shelf it #8217;s because I either haven #8217;t read it yet, or I did read it and found it worth hanging on to (which doesn #8217;t necessarily mean that I agreed with it, I own lots of books that I disagree with). The only time a book leaves my shelf and home is if I read it and don #8217;t see any reason to hang on to it, in which case it goes into a neighbor #8217;s Little Free Library.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I found one in a Half Priced Books once mixed in among the other Dune books. It was only $6, but I think that #8217;s because they rang it up as a standard edition of Dune rather than as a special illustrated edition. You can find it on Ebay too, but people like to charge a lot. I got mine off Ebay for $15 though by setting an alert to email me whenever one is uploaded. Occasionally people upload things at reasonable prices and you can snag them quickly. That #8217;s how I got my copy of the Dune Encyclopedia for $50 instead of $150.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I literally did, but you chose to get hung up on the first sentence of my reply rather than the main point. You don #8217;t get to dictate what is a good or bad book to read. If you can find value in reading  #8220;bad books #8221;, such as gaining a better understanding of their arguments and the people who adhere to them, then there is value in keeping that book around. Again, the ideas aren #8217;t going away just because you burned the book. All that does is make it harder for the rest of us to understand these ideas and where they come from.

    <TEXT>I think a big part of the problem is that there aren #8217;t really many healthy functioning trans people in the public eye. Really the most prominent person we have is Blaire in terms of public recognition, and even then most people probably don #8217;t know who she is. Obviously there #8217;s Caitlyn, but I feel like she #8217;s treated more as a shocking character than an actual representative, probably because of her history as a reality tv character. Since there isn #8217;t any prominent healthy representative in the public eye, these situations are the only situations people see, and they end up informing everyone #8217;s view of us. It #8217;s shitty, but I #8217;m not sure how to fix it since most healthy trans people also don #8217;t seem too keen on being a public trans representative.</TEXT>

People like this do harm to themselves, and more importantly they do harm to those who are actually struggling with mental or physical disorders.

    <TEXT>Depends what people support him for. A lot of voters are voting on one or two issues.

    <TEXT>Brand new. Sounds like the sales rep who signed us up more or less ripped us off. Not sure what advantages he got out of it, but I assume something. He lied through his teeth about pricing and plan structure, and by the time we realized it was wrong we were beyond the window where we could correct it. Threatened to leave them and they still won #8217;t budge :/ The one positive is that apparently the original sales guy is being investigated, since nothing he had  #8220;set up #8221; for us (pretended to set up) was actually real.

    <TEXT>I agree with the sentiment that we need to stop selling lies to people, but I do need to address something here. A lack of dedication doesn #8217;t mean voice training is impossible. Anyone can do it with the dedication. They only thing in anyone #8217;s way is an injury like what you stated, which sucks, but you can #8217;t expect people to say  #8220;anyone can voice train as long as they don #8217;t have this vocal injury or that one, oh or this one, and don #8217;t forget this other injury you can #8217;t have. #8221; That #8217;s not how people communicate. Sorry but I know so many people (including myself) who didn #8217;t transition until their 20s and who trained up from seriously deep voices and now sound totally cis. You can #8217;t blame people who say  #8220;anyone can do it #8221; for the lack of dedication of others. It took me years to get the hang of it. It was incredibly demotivating. That #8217;s how it works. It #8217;s nobody else #8217;s fault if someone gives up out of lack of dedication.</TEXT>

I remember growing up, I watched my mom and the women around me, not the men. I wanted to look and act like the women. In hindsight it #8217;s obvious that this is because I am trans. So of course I #8217;m going to want to look like a woman. We model ourselves off of the people of the same sex we see around us growing up.</TEXT>

I already stated that obviously edge cases like yours that result from previous vocal injury or something similar are obviously a different case, but anyone with healthy and functioning vocal chords (*which is most people*) can voice train if they learn the method and practice really hard. If someone is too lazy or unmotivated to put in the effort, that #8217;s their problem. The world doesn #8217;t bend over backwards for you, get over yourself</TEXT>

I haven #8217;t read 5 or 6 yet, but I hear they #8217;re pretty good. The first four though,  #8220;wow #8221;.

    <TEXT>That #8217;s normal, it took me probably until the third book to intuitively understand the whole world. You naturally pick it up as you go, and I think that #8217;s what Frank intended.

An important thing to keep in mind in Dune throughout the whole series is that it #8217;s not a hero #8217;s journey, and nobody is a good guy. You find yourself rooting for characters, but also reflecting on why you are, because in the end everyone is a monster.</TEXT>

Like y #8217;all I #8217;m trans and Rowling can be a bit of a terf, but y #8217;all gotta chill with this shit. Let her say her shit. You might find that some of what she says is actually correct, some is incorrect, and some is in a grey area. From there we can have a conversation and grow. Shutting shit down is childish and does nothing, and the fact that so many people find it necessary to do so on my behalf (in regards to Rowling at least) is honestly annoying and feels infantilizing.

    <TEXT>So I think you can break NBs into two groups. There are non-dysphoric NBs, who are just gender non-conforming cis people who seem to think that quirky presentation = different gender. This group is absolutely influenced by online discourse in their decision making, and they tend to be pretty radical. These people aren #8217;t trans, and often just present like their birth sex apart from maybe one difference (such as a male wearing nail polish and then saying he is NB). Often times, this group can also consist of homosexual or bisexual people as well, and because they don #8217;t fit their set gender norms they are told they #8217;re a different gender, when really they #8217;re not. This is the passive homophobia and biphobia that you find in a lot of NB spaces and discourse, unfortunately. Then there are the dysphoric NBs, or the actual trans people who identify as NB. This is a much smaller group, and from my conversations with them they get pretty pissed off about how the non-dysphoric crowd appropriate their identity. They #8217;re trans, and should be respected. However, I #8217;ll say that I #8217;m not NB and don #8217;t understand NB dysphoria. From my view, it seems to be less of a real third gender option, and more of a misunderstanding of certain ways dysphoria works, or from confused and sort of iffy perspectives on what it is to actually be a man or woman. A trans woman having discomfort presenting feminine, or not having bottom dysphoria, might think (or be told, as was my case) that she is NB, when really she just doesn #8217;t have bottom dysphoria and might not enjoy feminine clothing or might not yet be comfortable enough with herself to wear it without feeling awkward. Either way though, whether my theories as to why someone would identify as NB are right or not, if they #8217;re dysphoric then they #8217;re trans and I will respect them.</TEXT>

She #8217;s also expressed some legitimate concerns that even the trans community holds, and I think the solution is to discuss where she is and isn #8217;t correct, and where the grey areas are, not to silence her outright.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Because she is allowed to say what she says even if I disagree, and the correct response is to start a conversation as to where she is and is not correct. This is something I take time to do. I read her tweets and essays on the topic. I find the nonsense, the truths, and the grey areas, and then there is a conversation to be had on that and people can grow from that. You #8217;re right, she has a lot of influence, which means that if you try and correct her mistakes in a fair way you #8217;re going to get those corrections seen by a lot of people and maybe make them think a bit. I know a lot of people who used to be homophobic and aren #8217;t now. They didn #8217;t become allies by being scared or bullied or canceled into changing their views. They became allies because people talked with them, and eventually changed their perspective. Attacking her with a mob just reinforces her more inaccurate beliefs.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Lol it #8217;s not my job to explain everything I agree and disagree with her on, and that wasn #8217;t the point of this post at all. The point was that anyone who reads her essay with honest intent will probably find some things they agree with her on, some they disagree with her on, and some things that they #8217;re neutral or unsure of, and that there is a conversation to be had there rather than a need to shut down conversation because you disagree with a percentage of it. Condemn that percentage, whatever that percentage is, and have a conversation about it. Figure out what is correct and what isn #8217;t. Condemn the entire person and attempt to shut down debate and you only strengthen their resolve and prove nothing other than your own intellectual fragility. What I do and do not agree with her on is irrelevant. The fact that agreeing with her on anything at all is a problem because she has some bad views is the issue here. If you #8217;re so eager, I #8217;ll give one example of something that she has said that I would put into the grey area of agreeing and disagreeing. She has stated that gay kids are being pushed to transition when they #8217;re actually just gay, not trans. I think she probably thinks it #8217;s a bigger issue than it is, and can sometimes edge towards saying, though not literally saying,  #8220;trans people are just confused gay people with internalized homophobia #8221;. That #8217;s a bad take, *if* that #8217;s her intent. However, I know a shit ton of gay people who thought they were trans because of their nonconformity, and they had this false idea further pushed on them and reinforced by those around them. It caused them incredible confusion and pain, some even starting transitioning and now absolutely regretting it. Some of these people, when they  #8220;detransitioned #8221; (if they did) were attacked by who they thought were their friends. They were even called homophobic slurs. I #8217;ve seen this behavior. It #8217;s a problem in the trans community, and I agree with her on that, though obviously I don #8217;t think that #8217;s all or even most trans people. Something I do agree with her on is the sexual pushing that is exhibited in trans spaces. I can #8217;t tell you how often I #8217;ve seen people say it #8217;s transphobic to not sleep with them because of their genitals, and I #8217;ve often seen this turn into using homophobic and sexist slurs against people for the crime of being gay and having a genital preference. She has spoken against this attempted erasure you see in trans spaces, and I agree with her on that. It #8217;s a thing, and it happens more often than you #8217;d think. An example of something I disagree with her on is her outright defense of terfs who have done terrible shit. It #8217;s disgusting, and she knows what they did and she condones it. I disagree with that stance. I also disagree with her view of trans men, who she has stated she views as women. That #8217;s fucked up, I disagree. The thing is, there are conversations to be had on all those points, and without conversation nobody is going to change or grow. You #8217;re not going to scare or cancel the bad ideas away, you #8217;re just going to push them into dark corners where they will fester without anyone noticing, and they #8217;ll erupt out again worse than before. Like I #8217;ve said before, I #8217;ve never canceled someone into being accepting of my transition. I #8217;ve talked with them about it and over time they grew. Anyway, I #8217;m done with the witch hunt and having to explain what I do and do not agree with her on. That #8217;s not the point, and it #8217;s nobody #8217;s business. So take from this what you will, and have a good one  #128075;</TEXT>

And this response isn #8217;t exclusive to her. I #8217;ve seen people treat common non-wealthy or famous people the same way and with the same hate.

We #8217;re allowed to have a conversation about those opinions, or to not if we don #8217;t want to. I disagree with what she says, but I #8217;ll damn well die on the hill that she can say it and that attempting to silence the opinion by force or mandate will not make it go away or fix the situation. If you actually cared about decreasing transphobia as much as possible, which is something at I very much care about as a trans person who experiences transphobia, you #8217;d foster conversation and debate around the topic and prove her wrong. You might never convince her personally, but you #8217;ll never convince 100% of people. However, you can definitely convince a lot of people, most people I would argue, over time. I #8217;ve said it a lot here already and I #8217;ll say it again. Not once did I ever convince a transphobic person in my life to support me in my transition by canceling them or attacking them. Not one time. That has never worked. I #8217;ve fostered an amazing base of support through conversation, debate, and education. This includes support from radical conservative Christians, proud confederates, and literal cult members. Not everyone has come around, there are a couple of outliers who probably never will.

    <TEXT>I #8217;m not even sure how to start getting better and dismantling the walls. I #8217;ve tried for 6 years now with no luck at all. I don #8217;t know what to do about them, they feel impenetrable :( I think the problem I have with therapy is that I have so so much I want to say, but if I try to say the words my mouth refuses to open. I can #8217;t do it. The more I push the harder it gets, until I #8217;m forced to either tiptoe around the issue or pretend that everything is fine and that I don #8217;t have a reason to be there. It feels like the issue is my own inability to communicate rather than their inability to try and reach me. There #8217;s a lyric of a song I like that goes  #8220;words are just complicated air flow #8221;. I think my issue is that when the walls come up, that airflow doesn #8217;t happen. I can try to form the words as hard as I want, but I can #8217;t get the air to move, if that makes sense.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Usually I just stop being able to even say anything. I just end up going in circles until I shut up :( Maybe I need better therapists, idk. It #8217;s kinda hard to find good therapists. I can #8217;t just like call up a single local expert, ya know? I #8217;m stuck working with my medical system and insurance to find someone, and they all tend to take this sort of generalized approach that just feels like a script. They #8217;re all obnoxiously gentle too, which is like completely unhelpful because I *might* be able to force out a word or two if I #8217;m being pushed, but nobody is pushing, and my muscles would sooner shut down than let me say anything of my own volition.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I think that makes some sense, though I honestly feel so defeated at this point that I feel skeptical. It just seems like I retry therapy every 6-12 months and I never end up getting used to how they talk to me. Idk if I would be able to without seeing them for years and years, but I always get defeated and stop because it #8217;s hard to see someone once a week for 6 months and make zero progress. I joked with a friend recently that I need a  #8220;daddy therapist #8221; lol, but I think there might be some truth to that. I feel like I need someone who is going to establish expectations and isn #8217;t going to allow me to flounder awkwardly for months on end, but I don #8217;t know if I can ever find that or if that would ultimately be helpful either  #129335; #127996; #8205; #9792; #65039; Idk, I appreciate your help though. Maybe after the pandemic is over I could give therapy a try again. I just wish their were resources I could use on my own without therapy at the moment, but idk maybe feeling more comfortable quietly trying to deal with this on my own is just another symptom of my problem with opening up to others.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Always glad to see someone falling in love with the series! My only bits of advice are this: If you hit a period where you feel a dip in quality, don #8217;t get discouraged. Things pick up again, and then get really really freaking amazing. Also, I cannot recommend enough getting your hands on some copies of Laura Palmer #8217;s Diary and the Autobiography of Dale Cooper to read after season 2 and before season 3. They #8217;re both great accompanying pieces that have legitimately improved my more recent viewings of the series (but wait until after season 2 to avoid any spoilers, because I can #8217;t remember if there are any in Laura #8217;s diary or not).</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I remember a decent amount from the age of like 6 until about 7th grade. It was then that stuff with my dad seriously plummeted because him and my mom got back together, and I was now at an age where I was old enough to recognize his abuse. From 7th grade until about 10th grade I remember pretty much nothing. I could probably count my memories on ten fingers from that period, but even then they #8217;re vague and blurry. 11th and 12th grade are a bit more clear, but not much more, and I was much more distanced from my family and home during that time, so I think that #8217;s why I improved a bit. I imagine my memory should have gotten better during that time, not worse than when I was a little child, so if I had to guess I would say people tend to remember a decent amount, and having long periods of nothing isn #8217;t the norm.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Sorry to hear that you got sucked in to the shitty state of current trans discourse :/ This us exactly why I #8217;m so against the direction things have turned. To answer your questions: 1. I #8217;ve been pretty fucking miserable and confused about it my whole life. I didn #8217;t really have a word for it until I was 10 or 11, but I was feeling it well before then. I learned to hide it well though, mu dad wasn #8217;t fond of it at all. 2. I hate it. So much. I #8217;m MtF, and yes I would say that I #8217;m male. That #8217;s the whole freaking problem really. However, I #8217;m not perceived as male anymore, and I #8217;ve transitioned about as much as is possible, so I #8217;m much much more comfortable now. I #8217;ll always be male and that sucks hard, but it doesn #8217;t really feel like I #8217;m much of a male anymore, which helps a lot. 3. Absolutely. I #8217;d say depending on the day that my dysphoria is only 1-5% of what it used to be. For me srs was absolutely necessary in that decrease, yes. But even then just years and years of hormones and social transition were a godsend. Probably cut my dysphoria in half with that alone, and srs handled the rest. I #8217;m fortunate to pass though, so that could be a factor obviously. 4. Absolutely. I was diagnosed with a strict GID diagnosis, and I think it was really beneficial to get that treatment before starting. I think loosening things too much has caused so many dangerous problems. 5. It #8217;s bad. Most of the new trans people aren #8217;t trans, most of the people speaking for us are trans, and they #8217;ve made sure to confuse the general population on transition so badly that I don #8217;t see a positive conclusion anytime soon.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I would do that too, but it made it a hassle because sometimes for space reasons we had to stack, say, various canned fruits all next to each other. Canned pineapple goes faster than canned peaches, so when the top row of canned pineapple was finished people had to try and lift the cardboard that still had cans on top of it to get the the pineapple below. Once all that is gone, the balance is messed up and the top row tends to all fall. Sure, I suppose we could have sliced single-row sized sheets of cardboard, but when you #8217;re dealing with the volume we were and the number of people coming and going, we didn #8217;t have time for that.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Yeah I #8217;ve had this very same issue. They always either don #8217;t seem to have any idea what to do with me, or they #8217;re apathetic like I #8217;m just some rando and not a patient they are supposed to be providing healthcare care for, or, and this is the most frustrating for me, they infantilize me and treat me like I #8217;m some lost child who doesn #8217;t understand anything. I #8217;ve decided I #8217;m going to try one more time once I can work up the energy and courage to, and I #8217;m going to be honest upfront about my issues and my coping mechanisms so that I can hopefully get placed with the best fit, but honestly if it doesn #8217;t work again and I still get put in a horrible situation I think I #8217;m just going to give up on the whole thing. It #8217;s not worth the added pain and anxiety it costs me on top of my already existing pain and anxieties. I #8217;m sorry you #8217;re having a similar experience, but I hope you can find someone you click with who can help you :)</TEXT>

Then Children and God Emperor are just a whole nother level of amazing. Children is an absolutely incredible tragedy, and it serves to wrap up the story of the first three very well, and then God Emperor is just an incredible treat.

    <TEXT>I hard disagree about sequel quality. I think they keep rising to a peak at God Emperor, but I suppose everyone has there own taste. No way to know where you stand without trying them yourself though :) I think you hit the nail on the head with the white savior thing too. I think Messiah and Children do a great job at dispelling that narrative, and it #8217;s a narrative that I think Frank was aware of when making the series. Even in God Emperor, when you see the state of the fremen, it #8217;s clear that there are no heroes or saviors in this story.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>This is how I feel too from the mtf side of things. I left most of my trans spaces except this one because I #8217;ve kind of moved on and I got tired of how childish they sometimes are, and because when I do see or participate in conversation on earlier transition I just don #8217;t connect anymore. I think a big part of it is that you kind of grow with your transition. Things that earlier transitioners freak out about or get anxious about are things that are normal to me now, which often means the best advice I can now give is  #8220;you #8217;ll get there #8221; or  #8220;it gets easier #8221;, which people never seem to really find helpful. I don #8217;t mean to come across as I #8217;m looking down on people, it #8217;s moreso that I personally just don #8217;t feel the weight of their struggle anymore.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Sorry think this is a bad take. Like, I #8217;m a big proponent of the idea that people need to put in effort during their transition and can #8217;t expect hrt to do everything, but no, a vast number of trans women will still look like  #8220;men in dresses #8221; with makeup and proper clothing. At best, they might reach a point of  #8220;looking like a woman #8221; in the same way drag queens can look like women. But that #8217;s not looking like you #8217;re everyday cis woman, which is what people tend to want. Looking like a man in a dress is dysphoria inducing, people don #8217;t need to do that.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>This is so relatable. Even when you have access to the clothes and makeup to put in a serious effort to pass (not that the clothes and makeup make the woman, but if you #8217;re in a middle-phase they help cover up masculine things and signal to people your gender), it can cause significant dysphoria to do that when you still feel like just some man in a dress. I started socially transitioning a couple years into my medical transition because I needed to hit a point where I passed enough without those things to feel comfortable doing them.

I #8217;ve gotten to the point where I joke about personally being incredibly transphobic because of how much I can #8217;t stand other MtFs.

Rather than try and recognize and help me through my insecurities, they latched onto them and made them worse and took advantage of me to try and make me some poster child.

    <TEXT>There are a couple small references here and there, yeah. Especially in season 2, because Windham Earl is covered a lot in the later sections of the book, and those references get picked up into the show too. A small handful of nods here and there really, even a few potential ones in season 3. The only thing that really puts the book into non-canon territory (and likely this is why it never got further prints or an audiobook, if I had to guess) is that the last handful of pages actually introduce the very beginning of Fire Walk With Me, but with Coop as the lead detective as originally planned. I #8217;d say it #8217;s about as canon as Laura #8217;s diary, in that it #8217;s interesting back story and a reference here or there might make it into the show.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I think a fundamental difference with trans people vs other groups is that not wanting to be an outside group is a central component of transition. I have no desire to publicly identify myself as a trans woman and to fight for trans rights as part of an organized movement. Transition amounted to a 5 year medical treatment that I finished. I live in the world as a woman now, and so I #8217;ve pretty much left the whole trans part of my life in the past at this point. I can see how it might be different for those who don #8217;t pass, but like idk for those of us that have ok transitions organizing around a movement and controlling a narrative is so far out of the picture when it comes to where I want my life to go. It feels selfish of me, but idk access to hormones, srs, therapies, legal gender changes, etc didn #8217;t come as a result from nationwide protests and some controlled narrative, they came as a result of us keeping to ourselves letting the medical professionals do their job. Maybe it #8217;s too late to go back to that now, maybe the radicals took that away from is forever, but idk I just feel done. I think maybe the next generation of trans people who have to deal with the inevitable backlash against the current ideology will have to fight to re-establish our legitimacy, but as selfish as it might be I just don #8217;t see that as my fight. At least not publicly. I voice my concern online anonymously, but irl I don #8217;t want anything to do with it. I #8217;m not outing myself when I #8217;ve come this far. Anyway sorry for the rambling I #8217;m stoned rn lol, but I hope that made sense</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Honestly as a trans person Denise is probably the best handling of a trans person ever put on network tv. Hell, she #8217;s better than most trans characters period. Sure there #8217;s a joke or two thrown in, but so what? They #8217;re not offensive jokes, they #8217;re sorta pointing fun at the wild thing that is a transition and how it impacts someone and those around them, because believe it or not but there are a lot of moments between friends and family when you transition that are awkward or weird or funny, and you learn to laugh about them together. Just fantastically done all around, and her return in S3 was one of my favorite parts of the entire show.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Idk JY doesn #8217;t strike me as a genuinely dysphoric person. JY strikes me as a pedo and fetishistic man who is taking advantage of the current trans situation to prey on children. I #8217;m not respecting him lol. Obviously misgendering a trans person just because you don #8217;t like them is bad. Just struck me that the JY example was a bad one</TEXT>

    <TEXT>You can make pretty solid guesses sometimes as to what somebody #8217;s intention is. There #8217;s tons of evidence that JY is abusing the system. This isn #8217;t a case of  #8220;JY is a pedo so must not be trans #8221;. No, or course there are horrible trans people just like there are horrible people in any population. But it #8217;s pretty clear that that isn #8217;t the case with JY. Will we ever know 100%? Probably not. Has JY left room for reasonable doubt? No, he hasn #8217;t. Things are pretty clear as far as he #8217;s concerned. At least as clear as they could possibly be.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>BDSM isn #8217;t inherently abusive, but can easily be if not negotiated properly, if not 125% consensual, if the people engaging in it are inexperienced, etc. The real worry when it comes to BDSM and abuse is that people can use it to excuse their own abusive behavior or, on the other end of the spectrum, it can make a victim feel unsure of whether or not what they are experiencing is in fact abuse. To make it absolutely clear: unless everything that happens was safe and specifically negotiated before hand in a sober and consensual way, and unless consent was not revoked but was able to comfortably be revoked at any point without fear, it is abuse.</TEXT>

When people here say that we shouldn #8217;t be part of LGBT, they #8217;re making the distinction that we are different from a sexuality minority.

I was only clarifying that nobody here is supporting the  #8220;drop the T #8221; movement as it stands, and that accusing people who think maybe we should separate ourselves because we are different of transphobia simply because a different group of transphobic people want us gone is disingenuous framing. It #8217;s fine to disagree with the desire to separate ourselves. I #8217;m personally torn on it, but framing it in a reactionary or disingenuous way isn #8217;t helping anything, and the fact that I get downvotes for clarifying a position that I don #8217;t even have a set opinion on is stupid  #128526; #9996; #65039;</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Yeah enjoying feeling attractive is totally great. Getting a fucking boner when you dress up like a school girl and then going online and posting  #8220;omg I just tried on thigh highs and a mini skirt and just felt SO euphoric I think my egg just cracked uwu #8221; is fetishistic. That #8217;s really the only distinction I see being drawn most of the time.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Equating being trans with having a fetish is not harmless. There is nothing wrong with having different kinks or sexual desires as long as they are consensual, but calling yourself trans when you #8217;re actually just a fetishistic man is absolutely damaging. And yeah if a cis woman gets crazy horny when she dresses like a school in the same way that the man in this situation does, that #8217;s also a fetish. There #8217;s a difference between feeling attractive in a pair of underwear and getting a raging hard on and masturbating when wearing women #8217;s underwear. Big difference.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>So this was really interesting and even though I #8217;m a trans person I actually think a lot of these concerns are real and I speak out against the trans cult mentality myself. The conversation regarding genital surgery was pretty cringe though. Hormones change your orgasm to feel like a female orgasm, and with a good surgeon all your tissues and nerves are preserved down there. You retain full sensation during sex, and in fact because of the clitoral hood you now have your sensitivity increases. You don #8217;t need testicles to orgasm lol</TEXT>

    <TEXT>That #8217;s not what I #8217;m referring to. Feeling sexy and confident and desirable in what you #8217;re wearing is not and has never been a problem. Nobody is going after trans women for feeling those things. The problem is the people who have a fetish for women #8217;s clothing. Not confident trans women, I mean men who have a fetish for feminization. Men who put on a pair of women #8217;s underwear and get a raging erection and furiously rub one out. Men with a fetish. Now, having that fetish is fine, there #8217;s nothing wrong with that. Whatever turns you on as long as it #8217;s consensual is a-ok in my book. But having that fetish  #8800; being trans. These two get equated all the time, by transphobes and shitty activists alike, and equating trans women with fetishistic men who get off wearing women #8217;s clothing is transphobic as fuck. The problem is that if you call that out, which you should, you #8217;re accused of  #8220;attacking other women for expressing their sexuality #8221;. No, I #8217;m attacking a man with a fetish for appropriating my medical condition, and there #8217;s nothing wrong with that.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Lol, much more intense, much more full bodied, it can last way longer, you can have multiple. Takes a lot longer to build up to it though, and it #8217;s really easy to like fall out of the mood. Also like no semen, obviously, but like a lot more lubrication (like sometimes too much lol) when you #8217;re turned on ( #8220;getting wet #8221; I mean). Sorry if that #8217;s tmi lol, I try to be open about discussing this stuff online since I think there is so much confusion and that confusion tends to lead to weird ass situations like Joe saying  #8220;how do you orgasm without testicles #8221; on the #1 podcast on the planet lol</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Have you talked to these kinds of  #8220;trans women #8221; or spent much time around them? Guess what, they #8217;ve all been predatory towards me. Like every single one. Every time. And when I push back on that, they don #8217;t understand. You know why? Because they think dysphoria and transition is kink, that #8217;s why, and they think if they feel that way than others must to, but that #8217;s not the case. This isn #8217;t a case of  #8220;wires being crossed #8221;, and I think excusing the conflation of being trans with having a fetish just because you #8217;re worried about somebody #8217;s feelings is a dangerous and harmful concession to make.</TEXT>

I also work in healthcare tech right now, so I have a really solid understanding of nursing workflows. It was always something I thought was interesting, but in the context of my mom #8217;s job I never thought it was for me. Then recently I spent some time in the ER and it was like something clicked for me. Between my knowledge of the field from my mom + her coworkers and my current experience, along with this new context of being in a high-speed constantly moving environment, I was like  #8220;oh, in this context I *really* think I would want this job #8221;. My only concern with the decision at this point honestly is that I am worried about needing to take college chem courses lol. I used to be a solid A+ STEM student back in high school, but it #8217;s been about 5 years since then lol, so getting back on that horse is intimidating (though I think I #8217;m fully capable of it if I really put my mind to it).</TEXT>

    <TEXT>That #8217;s the current problem really. I have a job that is unrelated to my degree, because I won #8217;t be able to get an ok paying job with my degree unless I go to six years of expensive grad school, and even then I #8217;ll probably be making exactly what I make now. My current situation is about the best it could get with my degree right now. I have a high paying job at a  #8220;fun #8221; big tech company, but in the end it #8217;s still a corporate office job, and I think that #8217;s an environment that will be the death of me. With my current living expenses, I have about $1000 extra a month after my bills (including student loans) are all paid, and I think I honestly wouldn #8217;t care if my loan payments doubled afterwards and money was tight for a few years. Plus I #8217;m currently on a 7 year repayment plan. I can alert extend that out and decrease my monthly payments if I accrue more debt. I #8217;m just not sure how long I can survive if I work this job. It #8217;s killing me. I just got into the office and not to be dark but like it just makes me want to die. I hate it so much, I #8217;m crippling under the weight of it all just crying here in my office alone. It #8217;s horrible lol, and I would take being broke again over this any day.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I think it #8217;s a combination of autistic people tending to have a more difficult time with gender as well as the tendency to hyper-focus on things. Add in a medical establishment that is increasingly unwilling to  #8220;invalidate #8221; people and you #8217;re going to get a lot of autistic and ND people going through the system. Do I think most of these people are trans? No, I don #8217;t, but obviously some are. I know a handful of autistic trans people. One of them has dysphoria.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I think euthanasia should be accessible to anyone. Obviously there would be a medical and administrative process of approval as in all things, but I think that if someone is set on death then a humane death should be an option. I personally always believed and still do to this day that if I didn #8217;t look female by the end of my transition then I would have kms. Absolutely. My feeling has always been that I should have been born female, and I #8217;m doing the best I can to correct the mistake. I don #8217;t want to look male or ambiguous but  #8220;it #8217;s ok because I love and accept myself for who I am #8221;. No, that #8217;s not the case for me, and that #8217;s not the case for many many people. No matter how much I could tell myself that I am perfect the way I am and should be proud, my body will always be screaming that something is wrong. It #8217;s not a response I can reason my way out of, it #8217;s a permanent mental/physical pain. It has mostly went away, but that #8217;s because I #8217;m fortunate enough to pass and have had srs. If that wasn #8217;t the case, no amount of self acceptance would have helped. I know this because I tried that for years.</TEXT>

But like the supreme court has been ruling in our favor where it counts, and while it #8217;s within the power of the military to ban trans people the vast majority of our rights are constitutionally protected. Trump can #8217;t do much to harm us without a significant conservative majority, which he does not have and likely will not get given the current polarization. Hell, he couldn #8217;t even destroy the ACA when he had a majority, he definitely won #8217;t be able to strip constitutionally protected rights from us.

    <TEXT>Yeah I think that #8217;s a big part of it. It doesn #8217;t help that the things I enjoy are generally pretty isolating: reading, listening to music, smoking, sitting alone by the lake and watching the ducks. Maybe if I had more social hobbies it would be easier to meet people. I did find a group for a while when I started my job, but I realized after a few months that we weren #8217;t really compatible.

    <TEXT>I don #8217;t have a dog, and I #8217;m struggling to see how me smoking on my porch or reading before bed are marketable friendship qualities. And maybe I #8217;m just projecting my own anxiety, but I don #8217;t think many people enjoy having a strange girl they don #8217;t know just bother them and their friends while they #8217;re at the lake. I get what you #8217;re saying, I do, but I don #8217;t think it #8217;s as easy to make so many friends as you #8217;re making it out to be. At least, it #8217;s not that easy for everyone. I #8217;ll admit my own depression and anxiety disorders definitely play a part. Not having those issues would probably make me a lot more motivated and outgoing, but like I really struggle to do my best to meet people here and I #8217;ve found it to be really difficult. I #8217;m not sitting on my hands just waiting around. I #8217;ve tried to meet people, and it #8217;s just difficult.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>4 more years of Trump isn #8217;t going to result in that stuff happening, and 4 years of Biden will just lead to another Trump afterwards. Trump is a symptom of a wider problem. Electing Biden perpetuates that problem. By y #8217;all #8217;s logic I could say that voting for Biden perpetuates the very problem that created Trump and will result in further  #8220;fascism #8221;, therefore a vote for Biden is a vote for fascism. We can play these games all day. I #8217;m not voting for him. You want people to vote for a democrat, start nominating better candidates.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I don #8217;t think there are any rules to depression. I am in a similar situation that is supposed to mean my life is going very well (graduated, got a good job, car, apartment, etc). That stuff doesn #8217;t mean that I #8217;m immune to depression though. I used to blame myself for seeking out sadness and depression, because otherwise why would I feel this way?  #8220;Everything is great, I #8217;m just doing this to myself! #8221; But that #8217;s not how it actually works. You can have all that stuff and still be depressed, and your depression isn #8217;t any more invalid because of it. Please take care of yourself alright? I know it can be hard to stay level when you #8217;re thinking this way.  #128155; Edit: i also wanted to throw out there that I noticed you said you started to self harm. I get it. I do this too. I feel like a hypocrite saying this, but if you can try and find some other way to cope now you #8217;ll thank yourself in the future. It can become a pretty crippling addiction. Please take care of yourself ok? You deserve health and happiness  #10084; #65039;</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Yeah I read this book over the past few days and like I liked it and really connected with it and with Lia #8217;s disordered headspace, but wow am I on the verge of relapse right now because of it. I think the way she views her ED is very similar to how I viewed mine when I was deep in it, and getting thrust back into that pro-ED headspace was way more triggering than I was expecting it to be. Wound up slipping into some rules and restrictions the last few days again because of it, and now I #8217;m stuck fighting to get out of them. It really is like a guide, too. Like I #8217;m 23 fucking years old and have been through treatment, and even I picked up on a few things that I had never considered before while reading it. I can #8217;t imagine how a child who doesn #8217;t know what they #8217;re reading would feel. It #8217;s scary.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>23f here and I understand how you feel, but try not to hate yourself for it. Relapse happens. Recovery is not linear, and a relapse doesn #8217;t make you a bad person or take away the four years you stopped. I mean four years is absolutely wild! You should be so proud of that! I couldn #8217;t manage more than two. You are so so strong. I understand how relapse is comforting, and it might not be something you want to give up right away. That #8217;s *okay*. You #8217;re in a tough spot right now, and you went to something you know and are familiar with. That #8217;s only natural, and it #8217;s only natural to want to hang on to that for a while. When you #8217;re ready, recovery will be there waiting for you again, and you #8217;ll be back on track before you know it. Try not to be too hard on yourself. You #8217;re strong and your soul is beautiful and you deserve the best. Take care of yourself, and if you ever need someone my dms are always open  #10084; #65039;</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I know you #8217;re getting downvoted but I agree. I #8217;m down to once a day right now, and soon will be every other day. That #8217;s at the biggest size dilator I have too, which is like massive lol. If I used a smaller more realistic size I could probably be every 3 days by now. I only had surgery in November, so like dilation really isn #8217;t a lifelong issue. Less than a year and I hardly think of it anymore. And hell, if you find a partner with a penis then you don #8217;t even need to dilate after a while. Some people who have had the surgery for decades have also reported that they don #8217;t have sex very often anymore, but when they do it isn #8217;t an issue even though they almost never dilate. Things don #8217;t just like close up and glue together tightly again forever, idk where people get this idea that they need to dilate 3 times a day forever</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I didn #8217;t want kids before I transitioned. I was too dysphoric and depressed, and I just needed to focus on myself. Unfortunately, after almost 4 years hrt I really started feeling sad that I #8217;ll never have kids. I didn #8217;t regret not freezing sperm though, because I don #8217;t ever want to be the biological father of a child. I just have significantly increased sadness over never being able to be the biological mother of a child now. Now after 4.5 years as well as SRS that sadness is more pronounced, but idk it feels more like the sadness I would imagine any woman having over being infertile, not a trans-specific sadness or regret at this point.

    <TEXT>If you watch anti-trans content online you #8217;ll find that it #8217;s more often than not focused on some crazy tucute nonsense. Yes, there is the standard anti-MtF hate and completely ignoring of FtMs that we #8217;ve always had, but that #8217;s not the majority of the content. The majority of the content is focused on tucute nonsense. The way I see it, tucutes are doing double damage. Not only do they provide ungodly amounts of fuel for online transphobic content, their own agenda to demedicalize transition is also incredibly damaging and destructive to actual trans people and our access to medically necessary healthcare. So yeah, I #8217;d say that they #8217;re the enemy.</TEXT>

I never considered that before though until you said it. Edit: sorry, doubling back on this again because now I #8217;m thinking about it a lot, but I don #8217;t feel like I have emotional attachment or reactions to most memories or even daily life now that I think about it. Sometimes I do, and some memories do, but most of it is just emotionally flat. My ex referred to this as my  #8220;wall #8221;, like a protective emotional barrier I put up.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Yes, both words with definitions that are neutral and that you are unable to escape from. No matter how hard you could try to claim to be a turtle, it will never be true. You are a human male by the very definition of the terms human and male. Human and male are not identities, they are neutral categories that you fall into by no choice of your own. Guess what, cis is literally the same thing. It #8217;s a neutral category you fall into by no choice of your own.

    <TEXT>Cis and trans were both terms long before they were used in this context. Cis was not created to accommodate trans, both terms date back to Classical Latin and existed together simultaneously. Further, they have a very long history of medical and scientific use to describe two opposite groups, which is exactly how they are being used in this case. There is literally nothing out of the ordinary here. Getting upset over being called cisgender is literally as ridiculous as getting upset over being called heterosexual.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>You can identify that way all you want, but by the very definition of non-existent you simply are not non-existent. Call yourself that if you want, but you still exist. And  #8220;biological female #8221; means something different than  #8220;cisgender female #8221;. A cisgender female is a biological female who identifies as a woman. A  #8220;transgender man #8221; is a biological female who identifies as a man. Notice how biological female is applicable in both cases and in no way helps distinguish the difference between cis and trans, which is why the terms cis and trans exist. Amazing</TEXT>

    <TEXT>It #8217;s not jumping through hoops though. By the very definition of the term he is cisgender, just as by the very definition of the term he is a human and he is a male. If he wanted to be called  #8220;it #8221; then that #8217;s fine, nowhere in the definition of  #8220;it as a pronoun #8221; (which is a stretch of an example, but I #8217;ll to with it) does it say  #8220;this term only applies to biological females #8221; or  #8220;this term applies only to non-humans #8221;. The linguistic use case and definition of the pronoun wouldn #8217;t prohibit him from using it. He can #8217;t be defined out of or into using the pronoun. Cisgender is a set definition that he fits. He doesn #8217;t need to like it, and in day-to-day common life nobody needs to call him that, but it doesn #8217;t make him fit it less. Think of a trans woman. She is by definition transgender. She is also by definition a biological male. Now trust me, she doesn #8217;t like that, but lucky for her the only context in which that really matters for her is in conversations with her doctor and her sexual partners. It sucks, but she can #8217;t identify out of it. She is both a trans woman and a biological male. This is why we have definitions, so we can accurately discuss these topics.</TEXT>

I suppose if you really want to refer to trans people that way (well the ones you can clock anyway) you #8217;re welcome to do so.

    <TEXT>It #8217;s actually more helpful than you #8217;d think! Provides a sort of universality to scientific language. A French researcher, a German researcher, and an American researcher should all understand what cislunar means, even if they don #8217;t share a common language (let #8217;s just pretend they don #8217;t all know English right now, which is a fair assumption because people often might not know English well enough to make it viable for cases like this). Obviously it was more useful in previous generations when more people actually knew Latin, but once you get a knack for the different terms you can still universally understand scientific Latin. Back in the day before English was common worldwide I read that well educated people would sometimes use Latin to communicate. Pretty wild! I actually had a Latin instructor who has used it to ask a priest where to find something in town, since the Catholic priest knew Latin but not English xD</TEXT>

Being one bio sex while identifying as the opposite sex (that identity being their  #8220;gender #8221;). If sex and gender weren #8217;t linked, there would be no need to transition. There would be no need to take cross sex hormones, to get surgeries, to want to pass. All those things are desired because it #8217;s not about what gender of the day somebody identifies as, it #8217;s about one #8217;s biological sex being wrong.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I work high up in the US healthcare field from a more administrative standpoint, and something like this won #8217;t make progress. Without a federal bill requiring it, which is pretty much impossible at the current moment given that things that are far less controversial and are considered higher priority aren #8217;t being done, you would have to individually petition each and every insurance provider in the country. Even if it did become law, these providers all have top notch legal teams. Each and every one of them would fight it in court, and they would win. The only solution that would possibly result in SRS being covered universally would be a universal healthcare program, which to be honest has a far greater likelihood of ever coming to fruition than the likelihood of finding success by petitioning each and every insurance company in the country or fighting hundreds of losing battles in court. I don #8217;t want to be a downer, but petitions like this aren #8217;t the answer. Calling your elected representatives to demand healthcare rights and volunteering to canvass and phone bank for candidates who fight for those rights is the answer. Petitions feel good, but they don #8217;t make this kind of change.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>The definition of bisexual that bisexuals themselves have always used since the beginning of the community has been attraction regardless of gender. Pansexuals stole that definition and then redefined bisexual to mean something it doesn #8217;t. Specifically, they took all the stereotypes that historically had been deemed as biphobic and they grouped all of those in with  #8220;bisexual #8221; (obsession with genitals, transphobic, etc) and they took the actual definition,  #8220;attraction regardless of gender #8221; and renamed it. That is 1) redefining the bisexual community for us to paint us in a negative light, 2) perpetuating harmful bisexual stereotypes, and 3) erasure of bisexual history and identity.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>It #8217;s really cheap to not eat meat though :/ Like I suppose you could argue that there are certain vitamins or minerals people lose out on due to a lack of bioavailability in meat alternatives, but at that point I think you could argue back that most people aren #8217;t eating a very nutritious diet anyway, and the meat most people eat isn #8217;t exactly the most nutritious either, so even meat eaters tend to lack a lot of vitamins and nutrients too. Sort of a give and take really, unless you #8217;re incorporating organ meat into your meat diet.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I #8217;ve had some sh urges most of my life. Even going back to like being in early elementary school. I don #8217;t know why or where they came from. Maybe it was my abusive dad or the fact that I was so coddled by my mom that I didn #8217;t really ever get hurt unless I did it to myself. I remember I stuck my finger in a metal fan once when I was probably 5 because I wanted to know what it felt like, and then at maybe 7 or 8 I purposefully stepped on a humidifier because I wanted to burn the bottom of my foot. I had urges to burn myself on and off the rest of my childhood until about 18, but never really acted on them. I don #8217;t really consider those things the start of my self harm necessarily, because I didn #8217;t really understand what I was doing. I thought I was a freak for wanting to hurt myself, but like I didn #8217;t really understand why I wanted it. The first time I actively self harmed by like actually knowing why I wanted to do it was when I was 21 after a breakup with an abusive ex. That relationship left me so fucked up and confused and just empty feeling, and suddenly I was overcome with the urge to cut myself, so I did. Ended up in treatment shortly after that for my ED and we addressed the SH there as well a bit, and I was able to go clean for two years more or less (less clean with the ED, but like in active recovery). Now I #8217;m 23 and Covid and depression threw me for a loop, and I #8217;ve been struggling with increasingly escalating sh since July. Officially 7 days clean though as of like one minute ago!</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Excellent tip! I get pretty self conscious because I #8217;m on this antidepressant and anti anxiety medication that has done absolute wonders for me, but it makes it tough for me to orgasm or to even really like desire one (my libido is pretty shot from it). But like I still crave being intimate with others and I really enjoy making other people feel good, and so much of sex that isn #8217;t the orgasm is amazing. Things can still feel arousing and fun without orgasm, and like being able to be that intimate with somebody, orgasm or not, is one of the best parts of life.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>So much this! I (23F) have a really really hard reaching climax, but honestly it #8217;s not too horrible. Like it can be frustrating if it #8217;s something I #8217;m really wanting or that I #8217;m feeling pressured about, but as long as I #8217;m with a great partner the intimacy is my favorite part and usually leaves me feeling satisfied.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I actually have one! Well it #8217;s a different brand, but it #8217;s pretty stellar. If can get me there if I #8217;m like in the absolutely right mood and mindset, but the meds kinda knock my libido down to zero a lot of the time, so usually I just focus on being intimate with my partner. I enjoy the intimacy of the whole thing, even if I #8217;m not getting an orgasm out of it, and getting her to climax is one of my favorite things :) It feels good to make her feel good</TEXT>
