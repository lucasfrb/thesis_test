    <TITLE>Unpopular opinion: I don't like that native fruit is randomised.</TITLE>
    <DATE>2020-03-03 13:57:48</DATE>
    <TEXT>I wish there was an option to choose which fruit you want for our island/town. I'm planning to reset my island until I get the right fruit and layout. I just wish the devs just made it a little easier to get exactly what I want. For folks who like randomisation, I wouldn't mind for there to also be an option to keep it random but you can still choose to pick which fruit what you want to save time resetting.</TEXT>

    <TITLE>How is your experience with forcing out villagers via amiibo?</TITLE>
    <DATE>2020-03-30 02:45:39</DATE>
    <TEXT>I'm asking because Del unfortunately moved in on a spot that was meant for Pinky on my island. I have Pinky's amiibo card so I can move her in pretty much any time I want but I'm curious how forcing villagers to move out using amiibo works since I haven't done it before. I remember seeing someone say that if there are 10 villagers on your island already, the campsite animal will randomly suggest one of your current animals to move out but I'm worried that Pinky might ask the wrong villager to move. Edit: To clarify, Del is my 10th animal to move in so I think I should be able to force him out.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Hello, everyone! I have most of the recipes for the sakura items I can craft for you on the condition that YOU MUST BRING YOUR OWN MATERIALS. I don't mind exchanging for NMT but I would prefer if you offered me stone instead since I need the stone more. Edit: Your ACNH MUST be updated to Ver 1.1.3 to visit me. I will exchange 1 crafted sakura item for a stack of 30 stones OR 1 crafted sakura item for 1 Nook Miles Ticket. The following items I can craft are (with their needed mats): * Outdoor Picnic Set: 10 cherry-blossom petals * Cherry-Blossom Wand: 3 cherry-blossom petals, 3 star fragments * Cherry-Blossom Pochette: 6 cherry-blossom petals * Cherry-Blossom Pond Stone: 3 cherry-blossom petals, 10 stone (bit ironic since I need stone myself), * Cherry-Blossom Petal Pile: 5 cherry-blossom petals * Cherry-Blossom Bonsai: 6 cherry-blossom petals, 2 hardwood, 3 weeds, 3 clay * Cherry-Blossom Branches: 8 cherry-blossom petals, 4 branches, 5 clay * Blossom-viewing Lantern: 6 cherry-blossom petals, 4 hardwood * Cherry-Blossom Clock: 5 cherry-blossom petals, 1 iron nugget * Cherry-Blossom Trees Wall: 10 cherry-blossom petals, 5 hardwood * Sakura Wood Wall: 5 cherry-blossom petals, 10 normal wood * Cherry-Blossom Umbrella: 7 cherry-blossom petals Comment if you're interested, and I'll DM you the code. I will invite 3 people at a time to keep things more manageable. Wait until everyone is done and I'll kick everyone at once so I can keep things going faster.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I'm nominating u/Dannypan Sadly, I can't find the thread where we first traded and met but from scrolling my extensive chat with him, he made me several bamboo items in exchange for my furniture on March 30. We've been good AC friends ever since we met! He's a kind, funny, and generous guy who has been a lot of fun spending time with. Never messed with my flowers or trees. I'm so glad we're both turnip enthusiastists so we're always eager to make bank on the Stalk Market with each other. We're best friends in ACNH now and I'd love for his awesomeness to be recognised!</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I think my Marshal is glitched. I TTd backwards backwards one day and it's was still colton's house. However when I TTed forwards. The house exterior was still coltons but Marshals interior is the same. Even the name tag of the house was Marshal. Marshal was moved in via amiibo and colton was kicked out via amiibo. Marshal seems to function just fine. But only his house exterior is wrong. I traded colton off to someone too. This all happened on Ver 1.2.0</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Edit: Marshal has been adopted! Thank you to everyone who was brave enough to be willing to take him and offering what you can here. So I messed up and TTed backwards when I was moving in Marshal so now he's stuck with Colton's exterior for his house as shown here: [https://imgur.com/a/mCZls6p](https://imgur.com/a/mCZls6p) However, this seems to be a cosmetic glitch since Marshal's interior is how it should be and I can visit his house, talk to him with no issue. He's also been happily wandering outside my island when he's not in his house before I kicked him. I'm kicking out Marshal because it just feels wrong for him to have the wrong house exterior! If anyone is brave enough to take him, let me know your offer in the comments! If no one wants him due to his house exterior being glitched, I completely understand. FYI, Marshal is kicked out via amiibo post Ver 1.2.0 Update. If you would be so kind, please leave a review on my RMM page if you choose to adopt Marshal from me.

    <TEXT>Hello! So someone adopted colton from me. Colton was kicked out via Marshal's amiibo so the squirelly boy was moving in place of colton. I TTed back by 1 day but Colton's house was still there. The next day, Marshal moved in, his interior was correct but his exterior remained as colton's. Even the nametag on the house still showed as Marshal as shown in the image I linked if that helps. :-)</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Agreed! I'm a perfectionist and it pains me that a lot of my villagers displayed the plate without my knowledge when I was doing the wedding event.  #128557; Guess I'll have to kick out and invite like half of my population again because Nintendo doesn't let us edit our villagers' houses despite they made a game exactly for that but didn't implement it in New Horizons  #128579;</TEXT>

This was pretty much the entire point of Happy Home Designer. We can make villager's house however we wanted in HHD. I'm sad to see that how villager houses work hasn't changed in the main games. Like what did all the work in HHD go for in the end? Nothing??? I know HHD helped revamp how we decorate our own houses but it would be amazing if the same applied for villagers in the main games!

    <TEXT>I'm so sorry you had to deal with that  #128546; I can relate to you since I've always struggled with being overweight my whole life and having close family members who are and always have been thinner than I am as well. I would say that it can help to distance yourself and/or go with little contact with your sister if it's possible. I'd also say that maybe some perspective change can help you as well. Know that you and your sister are completely different people. There is only one you in the whole world and its not your job to be thin. In the end, everyone just wants to be happy in their life and being thin won't guarantee happiness. I wish I had better advice I can give you but I hope you the best in recovering and growing as a person.  #128154;</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I've recently hosted a couple giveaways on this sub. I use giveaways to practice selfless kindness in a way since I have a personal history of being selfish in real life. As a host, I don't think too hard on who my winners will be since I aim to be efficient with my giveaways. Of course, I'd to hate to unknowingly give away the prize to people like scammers since I don't really check my participants' histories, not that this has happened to me so far. (I hope I'm not jinxing myself oh boy) I think it's a really nice gesture to host exclusive giveaways but logistically, it will definitely be more time consuming since you would need to check participants' history to see if they're valid. Otherwise, those are my thoughts!</TEXT>
