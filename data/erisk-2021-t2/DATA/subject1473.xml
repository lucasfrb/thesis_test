    <TEXT>Thanks for the idea. I am considering building an aluminium box for the amp. But as I am only playing music at a fairly low volume I was kind of hoping it wouldnt get too hot. I am very new at 12v audio systems so my experience is rather limited. Would the amp still get massively hot even when running at a low volume?</TEXT>

    <TEXT>You could try to find a tiny switch from some other electronics and solder it on, or, more easily you could just put across the two solder tips so it connnects the circuit, this is only a good idea if the battery is detachable tho as it wont have a switch anymore and the only way to turn it off would be to detach the battery.</TEXT>

Then put it on a piece of tape so it can be stuck on yet removed easily. Also dont feel too bad, My Dji f450 is curently broken and i fear its alot worse than just a switch.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I have built several boats before. Most important thing to remember it that you will get out what you put into it. You can use plans or make them up on your own but if its your first time i would suggest plans. you can approximate the amount of weight the boat can hold by calculating the volume, 1m^3 of air inside a boat can hold a tonne of weight of 2200 pounds for the americans. i wonldnt recommend overloading it tho. Boats will always cost you more than you think and amore than that. when i built mine it cost me $3500 without the engine. it took me about 3 months 3-4 hours a day. Use fibreglass and resin to seal a boat and then put more resin ontop of that to seal the hull then fair it out by sanding it so as to get a smooth and true hull. What kind of boat you want depends on where you wil take it and what you will use it for. I get most of my plans off of http://www.bateau.com/index.php they have many resources and help avaliable. Here is a video of the last boat i built. Building: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z9A0isTrzNI and running:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GB9S6VxpnQo Bear in mind a boat that can hold 6 people will usually not be that small.</TEXT>

In Trinidad where i live i think people are quite deeply religious but not in the sense where the parents are and the kids arent, everyone is and that goes with the "no sex before marrige" so alot of people here probably think that.</TEXT>

Yeah i was thinking it might have something to do with kids having the idea that they should go against what their parents think and do what they want. Good to hear that you are well :) i had a friend that was raped and it was pretty afwul for her expecially because of the ridiculous religious ideoligies many Trinidadians share.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Carnival is just to enjoy yourself as much as possible, dont worry about who your wining on, I was wined on by some random old woman last year, my friend got a flex from a rolly-polly (google the song) its not really a big deal and flexing has far less sexual connotations here than in america. Altho saying this, many a time i have been wining on a girl only to be pushed off by the boyfriend(?) but noone makes a big deal of it really, if it gets too intense just take a few steps forward. Most importantly, enjoy yourself #harts2K16</TEXT>

    <TEXT>it looks handmade, without a kit. the construction looks to be wood laminated with fibreglass altho the hull may well be pure fibreglass from the pictures i cant really tell you if the hull is in good condition or not, if i were you i would sand all the visible wood bare and recoat it with resin or epoxy. if you could post some pictures of the inside and outside of the hull but closer up it would help me get a better idea of what i woul recommend for you to do.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Yeah she looks like shes in decent condition. perhaps the easiest is to just lightly sand the hull and repaint. thinking about it tho, the boat looks alot like its just a small dinghy with the console and covering added on after, reminds me of something like [this](http://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFgxNjAw/z/t5wAAOSwpDdVb0vX/$_35.JPG) so it may be that the original owner added it on, that could explain why the construction of it looks so poor compared to the rest of the boat.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Women typically want the same things as men, its just that they often get upset about things that you wouldn't typically get upset about Eg: body size/shape. they're also usually more vague than men when it comes to sexual endeavors. That doesn't mean that they don't want sex any less than a man, just that they wont outwardly express it. Also you have to be cautious as to what you say/ do around women as they may or may not kill you for an innocuous comment/action.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>It depends on how much longer you want the boat for, It looks like u have moisture in the transom so ideally cutting it out and rebuilding and reinforcing it would be the best solution.

Then clean out any old foam and rotten wood that's between them. Replace the wood with marine plywood or whatever fits best that is Coated in a few layers of polyester resin.

    <TEXT>to repair any impact cracks, you should grind away any damaged fiberglass. You can tell if fiberglass is damaged if it is white and flaky. good fiberglass should be relatively solid. then start rebuilding using polyester resin and fiberglass. to bridge the large gaps i would recommend putting duct tape on the inside of the hull and then putting fiberglass on-top. This creates a sort of mold for the glass. Because of the scale of the repairs, it will be cheaper to purchase about 6 ft of 3ft wide fiberglass cloth and a gallon or so of resin to do the job. As the hull was originally made from polyester it will bond fine.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>no problem. The ultimate epoxy for the job would be West system with their fairing compund. If i were doing it though i would just use polyester resin mixed with microbaloons. Its easy to sand and lasts long when painted. For the paint, automotive paint or "aircraft" paint works well and is very hard once cured. Gelcoat would work well for this too and can be sanded until its glossy and perfect and for such a small area wouldnt be too pricey.</TEXT>

You don't want such a sharp front as it wont run through the water well at all. I've built a boat from this site and theyre pretty easy to put together.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Why not go a little longer? on average a boat's width should really be 1/2 to 1/3 of its length. Also, in the plans it might seem like you would have lots of interior space but when it's built and the walls are up you will realise that is actually pretty small. A bit more length would definitely help. Good luck!</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Really depends on what you want to use the boat for and how long you want the boat to last, With that said, a boat made from cheap plywood that's sealed properly and stored in a dry place will last for a long time. if you can find a shop selling marine grade plywood it will work well too and likely be cheaper than Okourme around 60% of the cost or less while standard plywood will be around 20% of the price or less. Its really up to you. If you're near a large river or coast try to find a boat building/repair and ask about the plywood they have. But you could just cover the entire boat with fiberglass which will drastically increase the life of any plywood you use and add strength(and weight). Most importantly, enjoy your build!</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Similar thing happened to my Hilux, the idler pulley bearings seized up and locked onto the bolt, and then luckily the bolt snapped far into the hole so it started spinning. No damage to the engine thankfully. Just had to drill out the bolt and rethread it.[This is how the bolt looked](http://imgur.com/NIm8elQ)</TEXT>

    <TEXT>So, I'm trying to repair my dad's old watch, that he gave to me, the links are worn so I've pulled them apart and am in the process of repairing it, I have a few new coming soon, anyway back to the issue at hand, a while ago the top 12 marker came loose and I took it out and stupidly managed to loose it. So if anyone knows where I could find it or even something to replace it I would really appreciate it. It's a pretty old watch and fairly special to me, and I'm going to university soon so I want to have a nice watch to use then. Thanks again for the help.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Moderators, please remove post if not allowed. We are looking for 8 used SAE 400 lincoln welding plants with perkins engines (although different engines may be fine also), with less than 4 thousand hours of run time each. If you/your company has some available or know who can provide them to us, please let me know. Thank you in advance. Our company is located in Trinidad and Tobago, we are prepared to ship them from the USA, Canada, or anywhere else on the North/South American continent. If you have any suggestions about other websites/ companies to ask I would appreciate that too. Thanks.</TEXT>

There are many websites online which sell plans for a whole host of different boats so you may find something you like on them. Good luck.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Hi guys. As stated, We are looking for ideas, at the moment we are manually cutting and sewing each mask. if anyone knows of inexpensive machines or useful techniques which could make our job easier we'd really appreciate it. we currently have enough fabric to make 2000+ masks so id like to improve our production flow. Basic run-thru of our process: Cut fabric to make mask pieces(usually 8 layers at a time), cut string for straps (by wrapping the string around a bucket, we were able to speed this up by over 10X) sew masks together, attach straps. We appreciate any help and wish you all the best during these trying times. Please feel free to ask any questions you may have.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Yes, its being done on an industrial sewing machine. I don't think the cut pattern would allow for sewing before cutting. ill try to elaborate a little more on how we make them. First the inner layers are sewed together, then the outer layers onto that. The masks are then turned so that the outside face is facing out ( they're made inside out). once they're the right way out, the strings are attached. [these](https://tianascloset.com/index.php/2020/02/06/face-mask-against-the-coronavirus-epidemic/) are the patterns and masks we are currently making.</TEXT>

    <TITLE>Tifu by chopping peppers.</TITLE>
    <DATE>2020-04-23 00:10:31</DATE>
    <TEXT>This fuck up all started because of an idea, a very spicy idea. the plan was to make pepper sauce but the result was pain. So I decided to make lacto-fermented pepper sauce. I've been practicing cooking during the lockdown, and thought this might be something fun to try. So I go to the grocery and buy about a pound of scotch bonnet peppers, return home and begin chopping. All is well until I my eyes begin watering, no big deal, I continue chopping. Now somehow, a spec of my pepper manages to fly from the cutting board, directly into my eye. Again, a deal but not too big, I gently wash my eye without touching my face with my peppery hands. I resolve my peppered-eye and return to chopping. Now comes the fuck up, my face, and in particular an area just above my left eye begins itching, so I scratch it reflexively, and realise what I just did. I rush to the sink and begin washing my face but alas, each time I rubbed water over my face I was rubbing and ingraining more and more capsaicin into my skin. The burning, which was originally localised entirely near my eye began to spread across my face, my eyes and nose. The pain was intense. I rapidly Google "how to remove pepper sauce from face" equipped with the answer, I begin to smear a milk-saturated paper towel over my burning skin. The pain eventually subsides. I'm in the clear, or so I thought. An hour later, my hand begin to burn, and have continued for the last 4 hours. I've washed them, and tried a number of "cures" but none worked. TLDR: spiced up my day in a less than fun way. For the love of God, wear gloves when you're cutting peppers, and don't touch your face.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Mech eng in university is alot math and physics, with little lab work. So if you're capable at math and able to handle the workload you should be fine. The whole philosophy of if you should pursue something you're interested in or something that makes money is a rabbit hole that would take forever to discuss, and honestly even if you're the most hands on person who enjoys working on machines, that won't necessarily translate into enjoying your 9 am lectures. I'd also recommend trying to get some practical understanding of machines aside from your academic stuff, because many engineers are graduating with essentially none and it can be useful, even if its just day to day. If you have any hobbies or things that you're interested in, you can always look into making a career of that, try not to look only at one option, keep your mind open.</TEXT>

    <TITLE>Help Growing 'Local' Trinidadian Weed</TITLE>
    <DATE>2020-05-20 16:29:37</DATE>
    <TEXT>So you have your local seeds, which you got from a particularly nice piece of weed your dealer. What you'll need Weed seeds: Choose ones with darker colors on their coat. seeds which appear white or pale probably wont germinate. Paper towel Plastic bag Water Growing: Place your weed seeds into the paper towel and carefully fold it into a square, so that the seeds are within it. Place the paper towel and seeds into a bag, and add water. Don't add to much water, just enough that the paper towel is saturated Wait 24-48 hours. Some seeds may take even longer. you can allow the paper towel to slowly dry as this helps to germinate the seeds. Once your seeds have split open and a 1/2" 1.4 cm taproot forms, you can plant them into your soil Soil: There are many different options for growing cannabis. Soil is just one. The method covered here will be using organic compost with added dry plant matter to create a high quality soil that you can make for free. To learn more about making your own compost ([check this out](https://learn.eartheasy.com/guides/composting/)) mix the compost roughly 1:1 with shredded dry plant matter (You can just use a shovel to thoroughly break up the stems and branches while mixing it into the compost). You can start your seedlings in small 1 litre sized pots. keep the soil moist. you can leave your pot in a water filled tray to do this. Don't leave it in the water when it beings to grow out of the soil tho. Wait a few days, you should see your seedlings begin to emerge through the soil. Place your plants in the sun. These plants love sun, and you cannot give them too much. try to place them somewhere that gets direct sun all day. Water every day or every other day depending on how dry they get. After a few weeks your plants should be ready to transplant into their final pots. 5 Gallon or larger pots work well. if space is an issue for you, you can use smaller pots but your yields will be reduced. If your using local seeds, you likely now have 4-6 months to wait for your plants to develop. allow the top inch or so of soil to dry before re-watering your plants. Over time, add compost to the top of the soil in the pot. this gives the plant extra nutrients it needs for developing properly. around 2 months after planting your seeds, you should be able to see pre-flowers developing on your plant. [here's](https://www.growweedeasy.com/marijuana-boy-girl) a guide on determining the gender of your plants Be aware that hermaphroditism is a very common trait in local weed, and seeing some preflowers that appear female dose not mean your plant won't soon being showing male preflowers as well. You can remove the male flowers as you see them develop, but we recommend removing and destroying the herming plants. this means that your full female plants are less likely to be pollinated and it also may over time improve the quality of the weed in Trinidad. (Imagine being able to say " yeah i helped to make this")  #8203; There's a window of time when your plants are best for harvest. [Here](https://www.growweedeasy.com/harvest) is a guide to when to harvest your plants Once harvested, you need to dry and cure your buds. hang them in an area with some ventilation. this will typically take 2-4 days depending on your conditions. You can feel when the buds have dried properly. they should feel like weed now place your weed into a sealed jar. keep this in a dark place for 1 week to 2 months. during the first week or so of cure you should open the jar once daily to allow the air to exchange and reduce the chance of mold. this helps to break down the chlorophyll, which is what causes a grassy taste in your weed. You now have smokable weed.  #8203; This post (and the whole subreddit) is still being developed and will be updated soon.</TEXT>

    <TITLE>Improving seed germination rates.</TITLE>
    <DATE>2020-06-07 04:55:18</DATE>
    <TEXT>Seeds require a specific set of circumstances to occur to cause them to pop and being growing. The easiest way to simulate these steps at home is to do the following Put the seeds in a folded piece of paper towel. Place the folded towel with seeds within a plastic ziplock bag and then place this in a dark place. Wait 24-several hundred hours. Some seeds should open. feel free to transfer them to soil once you see the seed split and the white tap-root poke through. Some growers will allow the taproot to grow up to 1" before transplanting, but I prefer to transplant as soon as the seed splits. This reduces damage to lateral roots and the hypocotyl. If seeds fail to pop(germinate) during this time, open the bag, allowing the water can slowly dry from the bag, triggering the seeds to pop. Ensure the seeds still recieve total darkness. this method can produce up to 100% germination rates. Ensuring that you're using properly ph'd water and good levels of nutrients can go a long way too but that's for another post.</TEXT>

I cover her at night so she receives about 14 hours of darkness. This is my first grow to completion. How much longer do you think she needs?

    <TEXT>I didn't say they were a disease, but if they can kill 3 and attempt to cover it up, how many of those other cases were the same? I agree that in a time of pandemic a mass gathering is a dangerous event. However, Trinidad has not seen local transmission in around 40 days, and with borders closed, the chance of transmission is low. My previous point was simply to highlight how much life is lost in each situation. and the fact is that 43 people have died from a police altercation and 8 from corona. When the police fired live rounds at unarmed protestors today, was that justified? how about when they killed a pregnant woman? Stand for something or fall for everything.</TEXT>

As for you dad, i think you may be overthinking that, as really if he was attracted to you he'd probably make stranger comments, and more frequently.What your dad said seems like a harmless joke. Plus its normal for parents to call their kids handsome/pretty. As for your BF, idk man that seems very creepy.

    <TEXT>I have been for the last 24 hours frantically posting this information to attempt to gain international awareness of an impending ecological disaster. It is known that if humans went extinct, the earth would likely eventually recover, and with it, new biodiversity. What were facing today is a massive ecosystem collapse in all areas, species going extinct every day, 60% of biomass lost in the last 50 years. This Tanker, as terrible as it is, is nothing more than a drop in an ocean of problems which we face. Ask yourself, why do people care about food chains and species being destroyed? It's not just because they like a specific animal (which by all means they might) but that it signals the beginning of a massive ecosystem collapse, which ultimately could cause our own extinction. We need the earth to survive. The earth does not need us.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Here is a quote from the Trinidadian press release "The Venezuelan Government has indicated that the vessel was indeed tilting some time ago, but #160;emphasized that they had conducted initial stabilization works on the Nabarima and that it is no #160;longer in any danger. The Government of Trinidad and Tobago then immediately sought actual verification of this. Our Government has engaged via repeated and consistent communication, including multiple Notes #160;Verbale sent to Venezuela on the matter, with persistent efforts to achieve access to the vessel in #160;order to make our own determinations. The Venezuelan Government then agreed to permit a team of our Experts to cross the border and #160;assess the Nabarima, but subsequently shifted from an initial position that this could be done by the #160;end of September to their current position that the inspection team would receive permission to visit #160;on 20th October. Without such permission, our officers cannot cross the border and approach or access any #160;Venezuelan asset. On 15th October the Venezuelan Ambassador categorically described a new photograph being #160;locally circulated on social media, which purports to represent severe tilting of the Nabarima in #160;October, as total propaganda. He has claimed that the photograph was actually taken over one #160;month ago before the stabilization work was done on the vessel, and that it is now being held up as #160;a current photo in an effort to mislead."  #8203; It is in contradiction to the reuters post.</TEXT>

It took me about 20 attempts to get any attention to this issue. But now, the video got almost 400k views in one day. Awareness is the beginning of progress.

And would it need to reach this angle to facilitate the claimed valve repairs? Or in your view does this list indicate a serious problem? Your last point makes a lot of sense. Thanks again.

I'm sorry if this post upset you, i am just trying to bring attention to an issue which i see as a major threat to the health and livelihoods of many people frankly id be happy for you to be right in that it will not sink.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>You're comfortable with the risks because you haven't been addicted to nicotine. It is painful to come off of and in no way worth it for a boost. Soon you'll probably find yourself upping the dose, and using more frequently. Then you'll have no real effect from it except for not wanting to use it for 20 minutes. There are better options. Even caffeine is arguably better. Start with a healthy diet, semi Intermittent fasting, good sleep schedule and meditation. As an aside, I've been interested in lions mane for a while but haven't been able to get any yet. Do you find it to be a meaning full addition?

    <TEXT>https://www.instagram.com/p/CGcfiMzn1Pm/?igshid=4cpt22q66ktd Translated below: eudis girot TRAGICAL SITUATION OF THE NABARIMA. This is the reality of the NABARIMA oil storage tank, which is located in the Paria Peninsula, Sucre State, in the Caribbean Sea and near the Atlantic Ocean. It is a storage platform that contains 1180000 bis of oil, which are in danger of spilling, causing a great ecological catastrophe without precedent in the history of the world. The complaint was made by the workers in the past August 30, 2020 and the problem has come deepening. PDVSA has repeatedly denied this tragic reality and developed a campaign of infamies, disqualifying the complaint, accusing the workers of traitors and saboteurs. The attorney general of the republic must carry out a thorough investigation of the PDVSA board of directors chaired by Asdrubal Chavez, the management of Petrosucre, Costa Afuera in charge of Mar #237;a Fernandez and Pedro Figuera and all those who have denied this reality. The Nabarima is sinking, the situation on board is critical, the pump room is inoperative, the generators are damaged, the automatic valves do not work, the working conditions are subhuman, the physical integrity and the lives of the workers and workers are at risk. an ecological catastrophe without precedent in our history. PDVSA and ENI of Italy, partners in the petrosucre joint venture, must act with urgency and responsibility to resolve this critical situation and dislodge the oil from Nabarima.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Copied from other post "The Nabarima is sinking, the situation on board is critical, the pump room is inoperative, the generators are damaged, the automatic valves do not work, the working conditions are subhuman, the physical integrity and the lives of the workers and workers are at risk. an ecological catastrophe without precedent in our history. " - Eudis Girot - Executive director of Venezuela Oil Workers Union FUTPUV This is an avoidable disaster If you can contact your representatives, please do so. This disaster will likely impact most of the Caribbean if not parts of the southern United States too. [This image shows current flows in the Caribbean](https://publishing.cdlib.org/ucpressebooks/data/13030/6r/kt167nb66r/figures/kt167nb66r_fig174.gif). The ship is currently between Venezuela and Trinidad.

More info: Search "[FSO Nabarima](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FSO_Nabarima)" Operated by the Venezuelan state run PDVSA, this vessel is not quite the same as a seafaring oil tanker, it is basically a boat shaped storage tank, permanently moored in place. This means that recovery is potentially more complex than if it was a mobile vessel. [AIS link (ship locator)](https://www.vesselfinder.com/?imo=9316567) This is about to become the one of the worst oil spills of the century. The US ambassador to Trinidad has stated that they will not [impose sanctions](http://www.looptt.com/content/us-embassy-urges-immediate-action-fso-nabarima) or restrictions on parties looking to assist. We have just days left to prevent this environmental catastrophe. While this happens, the [Venezuelan government denys](http://www.news.gov.tt/content/trinidad-and-tobago-government-continues-action-issue-fso-nabarima) that any problem is occurring. \^This report directly contradicts the [reuters report](https://uk.reuters.com/article/us-pdvsa-eni-vessel/idled-venezuelan-floating-oil-facility-under-repairs-amid-environmental-concerns-source-idUKKBN2712H5) saying that the vessel is being listed to facilitate repairs. This ship contains 6 times the oil of the Exxon Valdez spill. The Deep Water Horizion Spill, in the Gulf of Mexico, was in an area of 1.2 million square kilometres. This Tanker, is in the Gulf of Paria, a much more enclosed area, only about 8000 square kilometres. The potential damage cannot be understated [Check out the internal condition](https://twitter.com/i/status/1300423451837108226) This needs international attention and it needs it now. This is an environmental problem that you, yes you, can directly make a difference with. Trinidad is my homeland and to see this happen is like a bomb going off in slow motion.

    <TEXT>No they are saying that because the vessel is not in a safe condition, and along with multiple contradictory reports, released by PDVSA. There are many oil tankers near this one. [https://www.maritime-executive.com/article/video-venezuelan-fso-takes-on-heavy-list](https://www.maritime-executive.com/article/video-venezuelan-fso-takes-on-heavy-list) While it is nice to believe what the government of Venezuela is claiming as the situation, it seems to be an outright denial of the reality.

He has claimed that the photograph was actually taken **over one #160;month ago before the stabilization work was done** on the vessel, and that it is now being held up as #160;a current photo in an effort to mislead. " Edit: to add, this image was taken on the 17th of October.</TEXT>
