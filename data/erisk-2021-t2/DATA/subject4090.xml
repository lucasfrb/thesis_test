    <TITLE>What does the Tower look like?</TITLE>
    <DATE>2015-02-28 22:42:19</DATE>
    <TEXT>Almost all depictions, especially fan-art, has the Dark Tower as a gothic tower. It's creepy and cool and that how it was originally drawn [by Michael Whelan] (http://s3.amazonaws.com/coolproduction/ckeditor_assets/pictures/1240/original/darktower.jpg?1302139012) in the Gunslinger and[ the Little Sisters of Eluria](http://www.darktowercompendium.com/tlsoe-2.jpg). The Tower did not get any description at all until Wastelands in [Eddie's dream.](http://www.phyast.pitt.edu/~micheles/scheme/_images/DarkTower.jpg) Here, illustrated by Ned Dameron, it resembles a very tall spire. We had to wait until the final book before we got it's true description. And [Whelan followed this description.] (http://www.darktowercompendium.com/dt7-12.jpg) It's is a very simple design that I personally think seems fitting. And what's even more interesting is that Whelan, like most of us, cannot quit the Tower. Several years later, unrelated to anything piece of Dark Tower literatue, [Whelan painted what I believe to be the best illustration of the Tower](http://www.michaelwhelan.com/wp-content/gallery/reproductions/darktowerlongroad.jpg). I love it some much that I bought a signed version from Whelan's website and have it framed on my wall that is in front of me as I type this.</TEXT>

    <DATE>2016-05-17 14:42:49</DATE>
    <TEXT>I was taught, I honestly can't remember from where exactly, that President Jackson's vetoing of the National Bank's charter caused major economic instability in the United States. But whenever this is brought up on reddit, there are those that vehemently deny that this is the case. [Example] (https://www.reddit.com/r/television/comments/4i8sux/andrew_jackson_was_so_so_terrible_full_frontal/d2whjgr) My initial instinct is to discount their arguments as tinfoil libertarians. Though I don't know nearly enough about economics to construct a counter-argument by myself. Is there actual debate among historians about how the dissolution of the National Bank affected the US economy?</TEXT>

    <DATE>2018-02-24 13:39:58</DATE>
    <TEXT>There seems to be greater momentum for gun control reform in the wake of the Parkland shooting, moreso than past shootings. The teen activists have marched on the Capitol, the President held a listening session, and CNN conducted an interesting town hall. The NRA is under a lot of pressure. Politicians are being outed for accepting donations from the NRA. Some corporations are cutting ties with the NRA, as activists pressure more of them to do so. [However, the influence of the NRA is overestimated.](http://www.cookpolitical.com/analysis/national/national-politics/its-not-all-about-nra). I have heard the NRA compared to Planned Parenthood as being the Boogeyman for the left, though I don't completely agree with that comparison. The idea is that gun owners would be passionate about gun rights with or without the NRA. So is targeting the NRA really that productive? And will this movement be enough to persuade gun rights advocates to accept greater gun control?</TEXT>

    <DATE>2018-06-16 20:39:36</DATE>
    <TEXT>Democrats and moderate Republicans in the House threatened GOP Congressional leadership with a [discharge petition](http://time.com/5308755/discharge-petitions-definition-purpose-history/) to debate immigration reform and to at least resolve the DREAMer issue. GOP leadership parried with agreeing to [vote on two immigration bills](https://www.cbsnews.com/news/immigration-negotiators-likely-to-get-respite-from-looming-deadline/) that have little chance of passing. Speaker Ryan has been adamant of only passing legislation that the President will sign. [President Trump has sent mixed messages about what he'd do.](http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2018/06/15/trumps-says-wont-sign-ryans-immigration-bill-on-8-year-anniversary-daca-announcement.html) GOP leadership fear that immigration reform would negatively affect their midterm success. It could depress Republican turnout if they pass anything, but also risk losing independent voters by not doing anything. The President's current strategy is to place the onus on the Democrats, which doesn't gel with reality because of the existence of the discharge petition. [Members of his cabinet have also justified separating families.](https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/morning-mix/wp/2018/06/15/sessions-says-the-bible-justifies-separating-immigrant-families-the-verses-he-cited-are-infamous) The separation of families is striking a cord with Americans and its generating more outrage than usual.

    <TEXT>Not by our standards, of course not. However, they did believe in extending suffrage to all adult men. They believed that all a proper citizen needs is a decent education. Democratic Republicans preferred America to be more like the First French Republic (though more in the vein of the Girondins instead of Robespierre's Montagnards). Adams and Hamilton, on the other hand, wanted to limit suffrage as much as possible so only the educated wealthy elite could make political decisions. Hamilton especially wanted to cultivate a elite class of capitalists to rule over the country. Federalists wanted a mixed government in the style of the British, in which the common worker has as limited of a voice as possible in the government. They saw the French Republic as the road to anarchy and sought to suppress any radical ideas, leading to the Alien and Sedition Acts. For more about this political decade I recommend *Tom Paine's America* by Seth Cotlar.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>This is a new dimension of cheating though. Nixon's attempt at cheating in 1972 was considered unacceptable and he resigned after there was clear evidence of it. The President using his office to pressure foreign government to interfere in our election may not be new, but this is the most blatant form of it. There is enough evidence that there is little question that this had corrupt intent. Now that the Senate has ordained this as permissible, the standard of impeachment that Nixon faced is obsolete.</TEXT>

For those that do, their current benefits are worth more than the dividend. The majority of that dividend would go toward health insurance.

    <TEXT>It depends on your definition of agnostism and Christianity. If you reject organized religion, where you have a set doctrine and theology, as they had done, then religious beliefs becomes a lot of gray area. Deism is kind of a spectrum. One side you have Christian deists like Unitarians and Quakers, and on the other far side you have agnosticism and atheism. Jefferson held some Christian beliefs but rejected the supernatural overall so he is somewhere in the middle. Beliefs also evolve over time so Jefferson shifted around the spectrum throughout his life. You can't pin him down as one or the other.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>The 1776 Pennsylvania Constitution by Ben Franklin and Tom Young granted suffrage to all adult white males and an executive council instead of a governor. It angered the wealthy and they replaced it in 1790. Vermont also had similar voting rights. The Federalists successfully defeated the American Democratic Revolution in the 1790s, but the OG America did have radical democrats. Zinn is a bit outdated now. Jonathan Israel's *Expanding Blaze* is a better read for this time period.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>First some background on the political environment at the end of the Eighteenth Century: The actual Illuminati was a group derived from a power struggle among Freemasons in Bavaria in the 1770s. The members of the Illuminati desired to move their Masonic brethren toward the Radical Enlightenment, which promoted democracy, egalitarianism, and spinozist materialism. The Radical Enlightenment was largely unsuccessful in Germany, but radicals did find success in France. The increasingly extreme French revolutionary ideology under the Jacobins made the term  #8220;Jacobin #8221; a pejorative throughout Europe and America. Radicals existed elsewhere including the infant United States and Great Britain. Anyone supporting democratic ideas were labeled as Jacobins, and assumed to really want anarchy and atheism. Conspiracy theories involving the Illuminati became popular in the 1790s. It was in response to the French Revolution. Conservatives, particularly in Britain, used Robespierre #8217;s Reign of Terror to scare the people from considering democratic reform or revolution. Part of their counter-revolutionary argument was a religious appeal. They argued the French revolutionaries dismantling the Catholic Church was fundamentally atheist and even demonic. The Thermidorian Reaction and the French Directory reigned back the revolution, but the conservatives still needed a boogeyman to maintain the fear in the common folk. In 1798, Augustin Barruel, a French Jesuit who had fled to Britain, wrote *Memoirs Illustrating the History of Jacobinism*, which described an elaborate conspiracy of several Radical Enlightenment organizations attempting to demolish Western Civilization as they knew it and replace it with a new world order. At the same time, John Robison mirrored Barruel #8217;s assertions with his *Proofs of a Conspiracy Against all the Religions and Governments of Europe*. Also occurring at this time, was the Irish Rebellion which was instigated by the United Irishmen, another secretive organization. Initially, these theories were not taken seriously. The Anti-Jacobin, the most prominent counter-revolutionary periodical in Britain at the time, was dismissive of them. However, only a year later *The Anti-Jacobin Review* (which had succeeded the original *Anti-Jacobin*) was more willing to reference Barruel and Robison. The conspiracy theories became more elaborate to include the Knights Templar and the Occult. Demonic imagery was already being used with the Jacobins so it wasn #8217;t that big of a leap. I do not know much about the growth of the Illuminati conspiracy theories through the Nineteenth and Twentieth Century, but Eighteenth-Century British propaganda was extremely effective and lasted in our collective cultural memory.

They'll believe whatever excuse he has for the pandemic response and economy. Meanwhile, Democrats are going to deal with a suppressed turnout. GOP knows to get in line, while Dems wrestle with moral dilemmas. Maybe his VP pick can generate some enthusiasm, but the Senate is certainly out of play now.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>That's a misunderstanding of our division of powers. The executive branch (in which we only elect one official to preside over) should be unified to execute the laws efficiently. The legislative branch (in which we elect many officials) provides oversight to keep the executive in check. The laws that the executive must execute also originate from Congress. Paineites did advocate for a unicameral government. We see this in the government of the French First Republic. The National Convention had no checks on their power so the Montagnards were able to consolidate power, leading to Robespierre's reign of terror.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>While everyone else is providing thoughtful ideas about reform to address police brutality, Joe doesn't seem to grasp what the problem is. He has spent much of his political career making police brutality into the epidemic that it has become. He often tell stories that features black men as thugs, and how he dealt with these thugs with aggression. His campaign is trying to steer him into the right direction, but he is too old and set in his ways. Biden is one step back from progress, while Trump is three steps back. Our political system has failed us.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>The take that abolishing police would just result in us readopting our current police practices is unimaginative. Our modern version of law enforcement is relatively new and there are alternatives that have existed in the past and now. In more decentralized societies, most police forces were essentially neighborhood watches. Communities are generally capable of policing themselves and sharing the responsibilities. The most interesting example in the present is in [Rojava](http://hawzhin.press/2020/06/01/how-to-abolish-the-police-lessons-from-rojava/). Even in a place fraught with war and violent extremism, they are able to resolve most problems with regional groups of community leaders.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Primarily because he's extremely old and clearly mentally in decline. (And so is the incumbent so that's cool I guess) Because he's old, he is resistant to change. That's a huge problem for a rapidly changing party and country. He believes black voters owe him for all the good he has done for them and ignore all the bad stuff he has done for them. (And so is the incumbent so that's cool I guess) He constantly says healthcare is a right, but also believes that it is a right that can be denied. The benefit of electing Biden is that we'll have a more diverse cabinet, and we'll have competent professionals back in the White House. Overall Biden is a one step forward, two steps back candidate, while Trump is just three steps backwards.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>His best strategy is to disrupt the electoral process as much as possible. Basically, he needs to attack the legitimacy of the election and depress turnout as much as possible. He can play both the pandemic angle and the foreign interference angle. And he has the power of the federal government to achieve these goals. As we have seen over the past four years, laws are only soft limits on the president's ability to abuse the power of his office. It really comes down what he's willing to risk to win. He's already attacking the legitimacy of mail-in ballots, which will be a necessity for many Americans. Yet the federal government has little power on how states run their elections. Even if the courts don't let him limit the use of mail-in ballots, his attacks can still depress turnout. He may risk actively soliciting foreign intervention, or at least enable it. He can tie the hands of the intelligence community to police foreign interference. If he doesn't pursue outright illegal behavior, he can still claim that foreign countries are actively supporting Biden to further delegitimize the election. With enough disinformation and uncertainty conspiracy theories can have real legs. Since it will take longer to get the election results from mail-in ballots, Trump will be able to sow more confusion and raise enough support that the actual election result could be held up in courts weeks or months. There could even be recounts that will be worse than Florida in 2000.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>There was heavy conflict between the Catholic Church and the Anglican Church from the 16th to 18th Centuries in Britain that led to a series of civil wars, which is also when serious study of history began. The Anglicans eventually prevailed and, because they're the British Empire, British historians established the mainstream historical narrative. In their narrative, the Catholic Church is the worst thing ever. According to Edward Gibbon, the Catholic Church is the chief cause of the collapse of the Roman Empire. The Church apparently hates all science despite the Scientific Revolution happening and much of it occurring it in Catholic states. Our conception of the Spanish Inquisition being genocidal is also a British invention.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>It's actually the academic historical consensus. The reasons that Spongebob cites weren't really true. Spongebob here has been subjected to Nazi propaganda. Hitler's narrative is that Germany was a victim of the meanie allied powers who forced Germany to have a dysfunctional democracy. In reality, the League of Nations did almost nothing to enforce the terms of the Treaty of Versailles. Britain and France were deathly afraid of another large-scale conflict so they didn't put up a fight when Germany violated the terms. The Weimar Republic was one of the most advanced and progressive governments in Europe. The myth of great economic turmoil is helped that the Great Depression did occur, but Germany was not as worse off as the rest of Europe. The Weimar Republic was so successful that conservatives (folks that wanted to go back to the imperial days with a class of military elite) had little influence. In order to boost their influence, the conservative party began courting fringe right-wing extremist groups. Hitler was useful in promoting the idea that social democracy is bad because it makes German men weak. The Nazis exploited the conservatives desire for power and eventually outmaneuvered the moderate conservatives to hijack the conservative movement. Thanks to the help of moderate conservatives, who just wanted less immigrants and more protections for the rich, the extremists defeated democracy in Germany. [But don't take my word for it.](https://www.google.com/books/edition/The_Death_of_Democracy/zV2RDwAAQBAJ?hl=en amp;gbpv=1 amp;printsec=frontcover)</TEXT>

Germany's industrialized genocide and ruthless racial supremacy is unlike anything else that has ever occurred. Saying otherwise is a severe disservice to the victims of the Third Reich. You can point out nations that stacked up a higher kill count, but it was the Nazi's evil intent that is unparalleled.

    <TEXT>Ah, moving the goal posts. The Spring offensive was a last ditch attempt before the US had a full force ready to go. President Wilson had deliberately kept the US unprepared to go to war in fear that mobilizing would be a slippery slope to declaring war. So when the US finally did declare war in 1917, it took months to develop combat-ready units. By early 1918, the US only a handful of combat-ready units. Germany knew they had to strike a final blow before more US units were on battlefield.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>You think British colonist's went around and thought "let's do some genocide"? They really thought "we must save these people and make them propserous which we will all profit from, but maybe some might have to die to achieve this. We know best." Of course modern Brits acknowledge that this is wrong. However, they still must feed their insatiable cultural desire to dominate. Dr. Who makes colonialism abstract enough to be appealing. The doctor is an obviously superior being that cannot be questioned. The people he helps are obviously in need of help that it cannot be questioned. It's the perfect show for a dying empire.</TEXT>

Nimitz in a public address shortly after and Arnold commented on it in a New York Times article. I think the issue is the presumption that Japan had to be invaded. Military leaders had assessed that Japan's Navy and Air Force had been completely neutralized. Japan no longer posed a threat to anyone. Hypothetically, the Allies could have blockaded Japan for a prolonged stalemate until they eventually succumbed at little cost.</TEXT>

Radical Enlightenment is specifically the ideology that wished to replace dogmatic, organized religion with natural religion as well as ripping down monarch and aristocracy.

The Radical Enlightenment threatened the established powers of Europe: the monarchy, aristocracy, and the clergy. These institutions certainly did not want give up their power so they had to discredit and drown out the Radical Enlightenment. The Radical Enlightenment in the Netherlands and Poland was suppressed through military force. It was ended in France when the Montagnards seized power by using violent populism.

    <TEXT>Mac didn't know how to come out to his father. His dad wouldn't understand and wouldn't react well to just "Dad, I'm gay". Mac also couldn't explain it to Frank. Frank didn't understand homosexuality either. So Mac came up with a dance to explain why he chose to come out in a way that words cannot express. Mac's dad still didn't understand, but Frank finally understood why Mac is gay.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>We should consider the purpose behind how the Axis powers were treated after the war. The purpose is not to punish and deter it from happening again; that's how the Treaty of Versailles led to WW2. The purpose is to rehabilitate the countries to avoid militarism in the future and prevent another world war. Why should the people pay for what their leaders did? So in the case of Japan, the Allies had to find the best way to build a non-militarist Japan. Maintaining the emperor was necessary to handle the transition. It didn't go perfectly, but I think we can agree that the overall rehabilitation has been successful. We got anime.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>While there is scant evidence of him existing, that could be said for almost any figure during that time and region, with the exception of prominent rulers and authors. Yeshua was an illiterate peasant, so of course there wouldn't be a whole lot of direct evidence of his existence. His existence is debatable, but I would err that there was a historical Yeshua of some sort on which the Gospels are based on. It's hard to say how much of the books are based on that man and how much was lifted from other stories, or made up altogether. However, it's reasonable to believe that there was a man named Yeshua who claimed to be the messiah (as many had before him) and led a populist revolt against the priest class in Jerusalem. And it's also reasonable to be skeptical of his existence.</TEXT>

They maintain the appearance of left-wing policies with trinket measures. Corporations will still have overwhelming influence in our democracy, but their taxes will be raised slightly. He'll claim to support BLM, but not really address why BLM exists in the first place; preferring to maim black people instead of murdering them is not a progressive stance. He'll claim to support women, but not excuse his sexually aggressive actions or of his allies. The Democratic Party is a conservative party and the Republican Party is an ultra-conservative party.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>True, I really hope Biden gets the For the People Act and the Green New Deal through. That would be a good starting point. But those alone are not enough to withstand the future of climate change. I see two possibilities. He can go the the Carter route: Biden makes some incremental change and is remembered as a mediocre one-term president. He won't go after the GOP because it will be seen as a partisan attack. So the Trump corruption will be normalized and there will be a major GOP victory in 2024. Or he can go the Clinton route: he can move toward the right to achieve economic success at the expense of damaging social values. He'll use the precedents Trump has made to his advantage to consolidate the Democrats' power and further erode our democracy. Either way societal collapse is still imminent.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>America was politically polarized in the 1790s. Democratic-Republicans (they hadn't settled on a name yet, they referred to themselves as democrats and sometimes republicans) wanted to expand the right to vote and spread democracy across the world. So obviously they were super excited about France embracing democracy and wanted to help. Meanwhile, the Federalists wanted a mixed government just like Britain with a class of elites just like Britain and oppress the poors just like Britain. Unfortunately for the democrats, the Federalists controlled all branches of the government because they purposely restricted the right to vote so they would win elections.</TEXT>

Before the US rebelled there were already courts and assemblies to locally govern communities. Colonists were already familiar with legal representation. So when they did transition to a republic, it was not a big leap. There was no power vacuum. Meanwhile, the French Revolution was a major transition. They went from an oppressive monarchy with the Catholic Church heavily involved with daily life to a secular republic. The French people either rejected the change, or went crazy with it.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Sorry for the late reply. I was looking at past discussions on misinformation. Your knowledge of the transition from what you call liberalism and socialism is missing the existence of the Radical Enlightenment. The most prominent scholar of the Radical Enlightenment, Jonathan Israel, argues that materialist thought originated from 17th Century Dutch intellectuals, particularly Baruch Spinoza. These ideas became popular among radical philosophes in the 18th Century which Denis Diderot and Baron d'Holbach spread among their circle, eventually influencing Thomas Paine and Thomas Jefferson. Israel argues that the Radical Enlightenment had greater influence on our modern society that moderate philosophes (Locke, Montesqieu, Voltaire). Radical philosophes desired to replace the traditional Western institutions with secular egalitarian democracy. Conservatives ended up successfully suppressing the Radical Enlightenment in the 1790s. While the Radical Enlightenment was pushed underground, socialism occupied its former space with a greater economic focus. I recommend Israel's [*The Expanding Blaze*](https://www.google.com/books/edition/The_Expanding_Blaze/grSYDwAAQBAJ) and [*The Enlightenment that Failed*](https://www.google.com/books/edition/The_Enlightenment_That_Failed/OdG8DwAAQBAJ) for more on this.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>[](https://www.pbs.org/show/frontline/)It's a few things: 1. PBS receives it's funding from all sorts of foundations (admittedly not all of these foundations are great) as well as the government. And viewers like you! You could say that the diverse sources of funding allows them to avoid bias, but I don't know the truth to that. Both PBS and NPR are good about disclosing that a subject of a piece is also a funder. 2. Unlike primetime broadcast news that is 30 minutes with about 10 minutes of commercials, PBS Newshour is 55 minutes long with no commercials. That gives them a lot more time to cover more topics and provide more depth. And if you want even deeper reporting, the[ Frontline series](https://www.pbs.org/show/frontline/) is fantastic.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>That's pretty cheap historically speaking. Transporting troops to the holy land was enormously expensive. It led to the Crusaders sacking Zara and Constantinople for Venice during the 4th Crusade. Naval transport of large armies really should be a luxury. It should drain your war chest. Perhaps something like sailing across the English Channel wouldn't cost as much. So maybe the mechanic should calculate the distance of the trip into the cost, though that limits you from changing course.</TEXT>

While on the surface they may appear similar, they're fundamentally different and goof on sci-fi tropes in different ways. Venture Bros is more concerned with bureaucracy, identity, and relationships. Rick and Morty is more about existentialism and morality. I'm of course more biased toward Venture Bros since I grew up with it. I think we all can at least agree that Venture Bros is objectively better aesthetically.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>That is incorrect. While it's possible to augment history with archaeological and anthropological evidence, history fundamentally relies on written records.

    <TEXT>The real reason is that violence is a form of political power. If the government is tyrannical and the other checks and balances fail, then the Second Amendment acts as a fail-safe. As a last resort, the people should be able to rise up and reassert their sovereignty over the government through force. The common response to that is "how would normal citizens stop the modern US military?" But the military are citizens too and most would not follow orders to attack fellow citizens, hopefully. The military also does not have a very good track record on handling insurgencies. Today, violence and threat of violence can really make your voice heard. Peaceful protests doesn't hold anyone's interest for long and often fails to achieve anything. Bring a gun to a protest and suddenly you have cameras all over you.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I have wanted to do a Venture Bros bracket challenge for some time and wanted to do it during the typical time period for backet challenges in March but had always been busy. However, in light of recent news and that this subreddit is a little more energized, and to make myself feel better, why not do it now? But I have some issues with how bracket challenges are run. In particular, characters can be seeded improperly. I don #8217;t claim I could seed a VB bracket properly either so this is a way of doing it better. Characters will be seeded based on how many votes they get. Though I expect some of these characters to not get any votes so we #8217;ll see how that goes. This list is of course not exhaustive. I also made it before season 7. Venture Bros has a ton of characters so I separated them into protagonists and antagonists and picked the most prominent ones. If they existed as a one-off pun joke then maybe they didn #8217;t make the list. This is also purely a popularity contest. It #8217;s not who can win in a fight. We already know Brock would win. I #8217;ll leave this poll open for a week and then seed the tournament. I #8217;m also open to any feedback/insults!</TEXT>

    <TEXT>You're still misunderstanding the relativity and magnitude of influence. If we all had a bucket of water each to fight a forest fire, and you poured your bucket of water on the fire, it's a positive effort, but nowhere near enough to stop the fire. If you convince everyone to use their buckets of water, then maybe we can make a dent in the fire. Some people rely on their bucket of water for survival though. It's also hardly feasible to coordinate the effort. It makes more sense to rely on the few that have access to millions of gallons of water and the aircraft to distribute the water to effectively defeat the wildfire. So yes it's good to reduce your carbon footprint. I'm doing it too. But it's not enough to avoid climate death.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>People as individuals are typically pretty smart. The reason they are willing to believe insane things is because there is enough uncertainty (made worse by disinformation) and they have been conditioned to distrust the government and experts. We tend to remember when government fucks up, but not remember when the government succeeds. Therefore, we end up with a confirmation bias. In a complex world, conspiracy theories create a more simpler universe that they can grasp and feel more in control. Older generations are particularly confused because they are not acclimated for the Information Age.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Trump's reelection strategy is not about getting votes. Some part of his brain realizes that probably won't win by votes. His strategy is to instead delegitimize the election through disinformation and violence. There was [a project this summer that wargamed the many scenarios](https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/what-if-trump-loses-and-wont-leave/) and pretty much all of the outcomes were bad. The best scenario is if Biden is a clear winner though. And if Biden does clearly win, we are likely to see acts of terrorism. [Qanon has an alarming amount of followers now](https://time.com/5887437/conspiracy-theories-2020-election/) and they will interpret a Biden victory as the deep state succeeding and that their children are in danger of being raped and sacrificed.  gt;  #8220;I think if Biden wins, the world is over, basically, #8221; adds Arthur.  #8220;I would honestly try to leave the country. And if that wasn #8217;t an option, I would probably take my children and sit in the garage and turn my car on and it would be over. #8221;</TEXT>

    <TEXT>First, the main comparison is that she is the worst. She is presumably worse than to the white male mass murderers Charles Widmore, Benjamin Linus, Keamy, and the Man in Black. Has she killed more people than them? No. Has she killed more people than Michael? No. She is objectively the better person. Second, is she a worse parent than the father of Walt? Did she kill more of Walt's friends? No. Does her mother want her to see her son? Presumably yes. Does Walt trust Michael to do the right thing? Michael is objectively the worst parent.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Now that I #8217;m sober, I see you had the best points. Thinking about it more deeply now, the writers did Michael dirty. His arc should have him learning to become a better father. His season 1 story was him doing his best but not doing it well. But then the show had to get rid of Walt and logically Michael had to go insane trying to get him back. He didn #8217;t get a real arc. He started out as bad and became worse so the main plot to the show could work. His redemption was not becoming a good father. His redemption was dying for everyone else. I interpreted  #8220;worst #8221; as most evil and now that I #8217;m sober I realize it can also be interpreted as least likable, which I guess maybe? I agree she was cruel to Michael, but that cruelty ended up being at least partially justified. Michael may have been enthusiastic about being a father, but she knew he wasn #8217;t fit to be a father. You #8217;d think the show #8217;s message would be that love is all you need to be a good parent, but it instead goes in the opposite direction. The show demonstrates that Michael is a bad father, who made Walt #8217;s life much much much worse. He would have been better off as an orphan instead of under Michael #8217;s care. She may not have had a whole lot of evidence to make her decisions when she made them, but the show ends up proving her correct. If Walt influenced her health, maybe he also gave her prescient information. In the end, she is a minor character who only appeared in two episodes. She is a background character for secondary characters. Michael and Walt weren #8217;t prominent characters after season 2. I went hard on the race and gender stuff, because that #8217;s likely the reason she would motivate someone to go through the effort of making a post about her being the worst. For most of us, she doesn #8217;t occupy space in our minds. Tolerating white supremacy and misogyny is why 2020 is what it is. We have to actively fight it. I was drunk last night and this ended up being the focal point to channel my rage about our situation. Anyways, I apparently narrowly avoided witnessing two of my neighbors getting fatally shot last night so I'm grappling with that. I hope things are going better for you.</TEXT>

The boundary was not physically enforced, but it could be legally enforced. Speculators needed approved paperwork to make their land claims legitimate so they could be sold.</TEXT>

I figured the system out in 2018 and successfully voted. I had to try registering multiple times to get it to work this year. Fingers crossed I get my ballot. I think I will. If I couldn't figure it out then likely others couldn't either, though most people are smarter than me in my 20s. Meanwhile, my brother recently moved back to Kansas from Missouri. He tried getting a KS drivers license so he could register in Kansas, but because of the pandemic he has to make an appoint at the DMV and they're booked through November. The DMV is also the only way to get any other kind of ID. So he's considering driving back to Missouri (4 hour drive) to vote in person.</TEXT>

However, during February, 139,305 travelers arrived from Italy and 1.74 million from all Schengen countries,* where the outbreak was spreading widely and rapidly. Italy at the time was the biggest hotspot outside of China.</TEXT>

In the 18th Century, these institutions were primarily the Monarchy, the Aristocracy, and the Church. While the American Revolution got rid of the monarchy, conservative Americans still wanted to maintain the aristocracy and church. The Federalists were the original conservatives, followed by the Whigs, followed by pro-slavery Democrats, and then Republicans after the Progressive Era.</TEXT>
