    <TEXT>The movie has 85% on RT and probably will stay in the late 80s till the limited release. The movie also has 5/5 on the guardian, 9/10 on IGN. Also the ratings are pretty divided, there are people giving it less than average, average, a bit above average and masterfully made.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>i went on the imdb message board for steve jobs and my god the hate. i liked this film but the hate is just awful. SOME PEOPLE EVEN SAY HE GOD AWFUL "JOBS" MOVIE IS BETTER. people wanted a film about ipad and shit but got a movie on the LISA and the iMac. i think they went in expecting a fully fledged biopic but got a movie on a smaller scale movie that has nothing to do with apple. other complains was that there was too much talking, kate winslet's accent suked(nitpicky but true), the father-daughter story was forced(i agree with that also but again that is just one thing). i dont get why the film is so hated.</TEXT>

    <DATE>2016-04-16 05:16:27</DATE>
    <TEXT>First of all what is wrong with them choosing a American actress for an American remake. i dont really care unless their acting is really good but then the movie cant be set in Japan or something because the character is American and would work better if it was in America. I mean look at Gods of Egypt, set in Africa and white people are portraying egyptians. now that is BS. Scar Jo is going to be portraying an American so what is wrong? they are adapting a japanese movie so western audiences could understand it. nothing wrong with that really. I mean in India they remake korean, french, japanese movies and the remakes make the characters from a different country to a indian characters in India and i mean there is nothing wrong with that. the same thing here. I mean the japanese could remake citizen kane i am pretty sure no one would care(but of course they should buy the rights to that movie). People are just bitching for no reason.</TEXT>

    <TITLE>(BVS SPOILERS)A perfect explanation of the Martha scene</TITLE>
    <DATE>2016-05-23 16:13:35</DATE>
    <TEXT>**Credit goes to u/Canvaverbalist:** Here's something I don't see mentioned when the Martha scene is brought up. The actual argument people have when discussing why they don't like this scene is that it doesn't make much sense for Superman to say "You're letting him kill Martha. Find him, save Martha." instead of "You're letting him kill my mother. Find him, save my mother." Here's the thing: At this point, Clark knows that Batman is Bruce Wayne. And Clark is a reporter, so he probably knows about the Wayne murder. His phrasing is intentional. Here's another thing: At Lex party, at first Clark doesn't know who Bruce Wayne is, but he's told that "he should know about him" since he's a pretty big deal. During the party, Clark pretty much figure out he's Batman because of his "speaking to Alfred" thing. It's absolutely 100% sure that the first thing Clark did once he got home was to read everything he could have put his hand on about this Bruce Wayne guy. **This explanation is the best one yet because it has been cofirmed that there are scenes with Clark trying to find about Batman and his past(like the Wayne Murder)**</TEXT>

    <TITLE>What do you guys think of the original idea for zootopia?</TITLE>
    <DATE>2016-06-16 15:31:10</DATE>
    <TEXT>I am very disappointed at Disney for not promoting a new and unorthodox idea like the original idea. the original idea with the collars was less formulaic(i mean even if you love the film you can't deny that it was formulaic) and had a great opportunity to a make even more powerful movie for example this scene would have been there: https://vimeo.com/167648053 Even though the movie might be dark, the ending does not necessarily have to be sad. it could be a powerful moment where they all take their collars off. i really am disappointed with disney for not promoting this idea and also dissapointed at the writers for not sticking to their guns. The only reason i am asking here and not r/movies is because the only reason they can come with is that it is too dark and not for kids and you guys would probably give more critical thoughts on it. i mean i just find it funny that people say it would have sucked because it was too dark. would you rather watch a potential masterpiece or a good kids film that is kind of shallow in what it's saying? i would rather watch the first option.</TEXT>

    <DATE>2016-06-26 08:37:12</DATE>
    <TEXT>So today was last day, so we got to watch a movie. i got out my hard drive with it's 200+ movies and i said we can watch scott pilgrim because that is the best movie out of there that is appropiate(except for that sex scene) for us and the most fun movie in my collection. So we watched the first 15 minutes and everyone was fine with it until when the scenes start tranistioning quickly and then when the fight scene happened, everyone lost their minds. i really don't know how they could get confused by something like this. it is just an absurd movie and they should have known this based on the tone but that was not the worst part. the worst part was that everyone hated it by just saying, "too confusing". the movie was not even that confusing. I feel like i am studying with 8 year old brats who squeal whenever there is kssing scene(i mean it was just two gay people kissing). But this is not the worst part, the teacher changed the movie(because two gay people kissed and our class was not enjoying the film at all) to fucking ice age 3 and my classmates actually started laughing. i mean there were some good jokes but the worst jokes is what made them laugh and they think the movie is great because the characters are "cute. if this is what people want in a movie and if people aren't going to use their goddamn brain then all i can say is that we are going to get shitty rehased, unoriginal comedies or action sequels that don't need any brain power to understand.</TEXT>

    <TITLE>Why the hell do people think that slapstick is dumb?</TITLE>
    <DATE>2016-08-24 06:27:12</DATE>
    <TEXT>I don't know why people over here think slapstick is dumb and needs less skill than puns and dark comedy? Two of the best comedy directors of all time are Charlie Chaplin and Buster Keaton and they both specialized in slapstick. Nothing from comedy since then has been able to match that shit(maybe except for Monty Python). Slapstick comedy needs more skill then you guys think. The framing of the shot needs to be perfect and so does the staging. he problem with movies these days are not that they are using slapstick a lot. They do not know how to use slapstick. I think these two videos from Every Frame A Painting will help you understand why slapstick is harder than you think: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UWEjxkkB8Xs https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1PCtIaM_GQ</TEXT>

    <DATE>2016-09-16 18:11:30</DATE>
    <TEXT>link to r/gaming post : https://www.reddit.com/r/gaming/comments/5318td/remember_digital_homicide_the_guys_that_tried_to/ There's not a lot of information about this at the moment unfortunately, because it's a very recent development (the papers have been filed and paid for on Wednesday). Much thanks to SidAlpha and MMO Fallout for initially talking about this. Here are the currently available legal documentation. No worries, they're public domain. And thanks to SidAlpha again for providing said Google Drive link. At the moment, there are only 12 specifically-named Steam users in the document among that 100 that are being sued, and they need to be contacted about the situation as soon as possible (but since anyone is welcome to changing their Steam names, it's going to be hard to find them, no?). It seems like they've also filed a subpoena against Valve to find out the identities of the 100 users that are being sued. I honestly don't even know what to think of this situation. I honestly didn't follow the Jim Sterling lawsuit much, but this one seems even more ridiculous than the last one.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>* **Total budget and country of purchase:** $1300 dollar or equivalent(excluding shipping) and I live in Oman but I will probably be buying it from an online website that can ship here. * **Do you prefer a 2 in 1 form factor, good battery life or best specifications to your requirements for the money? Pick or include any that apply.** good battery life and specification to my requirments * **How important is weight to you?** just needs to be enough to carry in a school bag(with books) * **Which OS do you require? Windows, Linux, Mac.** Windows * **Do you have a preferred screen size? If indifferent, put N/A.** N/A * **Are you doing any CAD/video editing/photo editing/gaming? List which programs/games you desire to run. If you have no requirements, put N/A.** I use Photoshop, premiere and mostly play LoL and games like Battlefield or highly demanding games. * **If you're gaming (leave blank if you put N/A above...), do you have certain games you want to play? At what settings and FPS do you want?** A ceratin game I would want to play is Doom and Rise of the Tomb Raid and I would like to play them at least at high at 60fps or more. * **Any specific requirements such as good keyboard, reliable business grade build quality, touch-screen, finger-print reader, optical drive or good input devices (keyboard/touchpad)?** I need a reliable build quality and it also needs to have a thunderbolt(to updgrade using a graphics amp like the razer core) * **Leave any finishing thoughts here that you may feel are necessary and beneficial to the discussion.** I have been checking the Asus Gl702 and Alienware 15 R3 but I have heard that the Asus Gl702 has this third fan that kind of fucks up the cooling system especially is I live in a hot country(like Oman) and the Alienware R3 is too over priced(my bonus question is that, should I wait for it to get cheaper?). I mean can anyone check if that thing with Asus Gl702 is right and could actually affect the pc?</TEXT>

    <TITLE>Everyone says that the visuals in Dr Strange are great but are any of them actually powerful or at least visually inventive?</TITLE>
    <DATE>2016-11-07 13:58:50</DATE>
    <TEXT>I saw the film 3 days ago(opening weekend Friday) and the movie was well underwhelming... Instead of me talking about the plot and characters I want to get straight to the visuals since that was the most dissapointing for me. The visuals looked cool but the problem was that none of the visuals showed anything powerful. By that I mean substantially moving or impressive like The Tree of Life or 2001 or at least The Revenant. The beautiful imagery in those films is not just nice to look at but also adds to the story and themes in a symbolic manner. The imagery in Dr strange was just superficial and boring for that very reason. Not only that but it had no continuity or flow to them and were just random shit with the most creative shit a CG artist could think. If a director with a much better mind artistically and vision directed these visuals we could have gotten a superhero 2001 or tree of life or let me quote the director "Marvel's Fantasia"(another film that uses beautiful imagery to show it's themes). The visuals were not inventive either in terms of design(other than one or two shots), cinematography or the way it plays out. Again, only one or two shots started to get somewhere visually but then bleh, the next shot completely changes and is something boring or him just floating around in some place. Neither was the final battle so inventive visually(with Dommou or whatever his name is) and was some boring place that looked like the insides of someone's infected body. I find it funny that La La Land was much better in terms of visuals and the way it uses powerful imagery and that film has 10 times less of a budget. Dr Strange is just so visually disappointing because of how superficial and flat those visuals are. There is so much potential in this film but it all got wasted so bad.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>So me and my friends decided to start making a game for our gaming careers in the future. I will be doing the programming(I have experience in python, and some in c++ and java) and my friend will do the game art(he is a good artist). We just don't know where to start. I have played around with unity but I still need to look up more tools and my friend has never seen a game engine in his life. We also don't have the time other people do since we are still in school. We just don't know how to work this out. I decided to make the game 15 min long and it will be a 2d platformer. Do we need money to make the game? Do we need to work a lot each day to make the game? Will making a game actually benefit us?(I mean I can't devote time on this and leave my studies)</TEXT>

    <TEXT>**TLDR: is it easy to carry a alienware around in a school bag that also has books in it?** I am considering between buying an alienware 15 r3 and a gs73vr(this model to be specific: https://www.excaliberpc.com/653247/msi-gs73vr-stealth-pro-225-17.3.html). Both laptops have similiar specs(except, the MSI has more ram and an ssd) but the big difference is that the msi gets hotter when playing and the alienware is heavier by more than 1 kg. I need to take my laptop to school everyday though so I don't know if I should buy the heavier but better looking and cooler (I live in a moderately hot country that reaches 45-50 Celsius in summer) or the lighter and more portable MSI. I am asking people who have had experience with carrying a Alienware around</TEXT>

I know I have to touch the metal parts of a case but I don't know whether the psu needs to be plugged in too. I am asking because my power supply comes with a UK power cord and I would have to take the fuse out. I don't want to spend the time unscrewing the plug and taking the fuse out.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I have bought all the parts for my pc except for the b350 motherboard. The only ones that are in my country(called Oman in the middle east) are the Asus ones and they are the worst ones. The Asrock ones seem to be the best but the only place I can buy them is from ncix. I need to know how long it takes for them to ship. I don't want to be waiting 4 months for a part.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I don't know whether I need to plug the power plug or not if I am going to use wrist strap and I want to do this perfectly so that I don't destroy my parts. And if I do plan to use the power supply, do I connect the clips to an unpainted metal part of the power supply or the case? I also read that if I have a UK power plug and need to ground myself I need to take out the fuse in the power plug. Do I actually have to do this if I am going to use the power supply?</TEXT>

I was hoping that there wont be any thermal increase but as soon as i ran bios, cpu temps was shown at being 81 degrees and went up. I dont wwnt to be taking out the motherboard since outting it in was the hardest. Will i be able to remove theemal paste and apply without having to take out my motherboard</TEXT>

    <TITLE>Thoughts on James Cameron's comment on Wonder Woman's portrayal in her solo film?</TITLE>
    <DATE>2017-08-26 14:12:45</DATE>
    <TEXT>I know this sub doesn't talk much about superhero movies but if you haven't heard, James Cameron recently said this about the new Wonder Woman movie:  gt; #8220;All of the self-congratulatory back-patting Hollywood #8217;s been doing over Wonder Woman has been so misguided. She #8217;s an objectified icon, and it #8217;s just male Hollywood doing the same old thing! I #8217;m not saying I didn #8217;t like the movie but, to me, it #8217;s a step backwards. Sarah Connor was not a beauty icon. She was strong, she was troubled, she was a terrible mother, and she earned the respect of the audience through pure grit. And to me, [the benefit of characters like Sarah] is so obvious. I mean, half the audience is female! #8221; And this is Patty Jenkin's response: https://pbs.twimg.com/media/DICzihOXcAAwEWs.jpg Cameron basically says the Wonder Woman is an objectfied sex symbol and is a step backwards in terms of how women are portrayed in movies. I have to agree more with Jenkins on this since Wonder Woman isn't about a troubled and damaged woman who is strong at the same time. Wonder Woman is supposed to inspire women and little girls to be loving, compassionate, and take responsibility. It is another type of strength that a character like Sarah Connor can't show. I can't really see how the character was objectified either. Sure she is wearing a mini skirt and you can see a lot of skin but the doesn't mean she is being objectified. The directing never tells us to gaze at her ass or body. It just is how the women from that region dress and is no worse than the tight suits worn by other superhero characters(male included). I don't think James Cameron is wrong but he is giving out a narrow opinion on how powerful women should be. Wonder Woman just shows a completely different type strength(one more feminine too for lack of a better) and should not be seen as a step backwards just because she is attractive and is not a rugged woman fighting through her internal and emotional problems. It doesn't need to be like that and shouldn't really be like that for a superhero film. The only reason I am posting this here is because r/movies turned into a cancerous battle of downvotes and hate to anyone who disagrees with either side.</TEXT>

    <TITLE>Thoughts on Bojack Horseman Season 4?[SPOILERS]</TITLE>
    <DATE>2017-09-10 16:25:06</DATE>
    <TEXT>I finished season 4 and I think it might be the best season yet overall. I think the reason really is because Bojack actually feels like a fully realised character by the end of the season and the 11th episode is probably the most horrifying episode I have seen in this series. To see what Beatrice had to go through almost makes me sympathize with her. I also think episode 2(her lobotomized mother, that was horrifying) and 9 are masterfully done too with episode 9 having a despressing and honest message at the end. The ending of this season was a happy ending for Bojack and I think he really earned his happiness. Acceptence is really what is needed for such a broken person. The end to PB and Diane's relationship this season was also well done and was needed. I just hope they don't try to make Bojack and Diana a couple next season. The only cons I really have is some of the hamfisted political messages and Todd was more comic relief in this season and didn't really do much other than that. He was funny but I wish he had more substantial stuff to do. Also the clown thing was a much more funnier version of the spagetthi strainer sub plot from the 3rd season.</TEXT>
