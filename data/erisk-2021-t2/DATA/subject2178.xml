    <TEXT>Pretty sure those are milspec boots, so I believe they will do fine. I have a pair of rocky s2vs that I #8217;ve stepped in many deep puddles and the water just runs right off them and they stay dry. If you submerge them past your shins then you will probably get wet on the inside of your boot. Just let them air dry for awhile.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Hopefully this thread is okay. Just been waking up lately feeling like this everyday. I have I guess what you would call a fear of dying. I don #8217;t want to die I wanna live my life out, I think about all the shit you could die from and it scares me. However lately I #8217;ve been feeling like if I died, I could finally be at peace. This world is a pretty horrible place( esp right now) I wouldn #8217;t have to worry about anything at all, and that #8217;s sorta somber. I wouldn #8217;t have to worry about what I do with my time here or all the bills I gotta pay and barely have 2 pennies to scratch together. Wouldn #8217;t have to worry about being in between civil unrest in this country (USA). Idk I hope the feeling will pass and I #8217;ll go back to being chipper. Just wanted to see if I #8217;m not alone in this.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>So many awesome redwing boots, see many unique pairs here. So what are your favorite models? For me my #1 is a tie between the copper roughnecks and the copper iron rangers. Both look rugged as all get out, and they just match with just about anything. My second would be the 875 moc toes Third would be the charcoal r amp;t black smiths. I feel like you can really dress this boot up or down depending on the situation. Lots of versatility there.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>For me they make me feel more confident. I just love them. It got started when I visited a store when I was a teenager. There on the shelf, I saw the copper roughnecks and told myself one day I #8217;m gonna own them. Years went by and I got my first redwing boots which were the 8111s. I got them bc I saw how good they looked on people wearing them in movies/ads and I fell in love with the style. I also now own two of those copper r amp;t roughnecks too!</TEXT>

Those computer sizers sometimes aren #8217;t calibrated correctly (redwing employee told me) I got measured on there as a 14wide on my left and a 13wide in my right when in reality I #8217;m a 12 on my left and 11.5 on my right brannock.</TEXT>

Well since I sent those off to get resoled with the vibram lug sole I got these out. Treated them with a coat of the redwing neatsfoot oil cream and laced them up with the pisgah range Ltd purist brown laces. Got a new wallet today too so figured they would look good together! It #8217;s a popov leather 4 pocket billfold. I love it a lot! Can #8217;t wait for both of these to develop that nice patina to them  #128526;</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Oh I #8217;m somewhat of an expert at this. These are my favorite brands that I have each personally used. Popov leather- they #8217;re out of Canada, however they #8217;re imo the best leather wallet maker out there. I have 3 of their wallets all are top quality and patina beautifully. Loyal Stricklin- the Johnny wallet..need I say more? Such a cool design. Both minimal and can carry almost everything. Not a single stitch on these. Trayvax- I love my element. It #8217;s got a very manly rugged appearance and it #8217;ll be around when the earth turns to star dust. Definitely a minimalist approach here, but it definitely works for me! Saddleback leather- various wallets of differing sizes. They all do their duties well and all have held up great. Das Offene Meer- the gun deck QuickDraw is an awesome wallet. Minimalist application again, but it also has the QuickDraw slot on the back. Sweet wallet great company. Hope that helps man</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Yup a victor mouse trap or a kitty. I had a few mice in my house, and recently we had one upstairs. So I layed out those wooden victor mouse traps with some peanut butter. Next night it was caught, skull crushed instantly. I felt really bad though. Mice are pests but they didn #8217;t deserve that so I just got a kitty instead. It #8217;s more natural that way anyhow. Haven #8217;t seen any since the trap though. Sorry about your boots man! That sucks. Make sure the mouse didn #8217;t crap in them lol</TEXT>

    <TEXT>So what is he doing then when he agrees to go do these things and changes his mind? Do you know what he #8217;s doing instead? Could he being hanging out with someone else, or do you actually see him just lay around? Either way definitely sounds like some communication issues. Seems like you #8217;re very effective with that so it #8217;s on him. The only thing I can come up with is : either he #8217;s going to hangout with someone else when he agrees then cancels, or he #8217;s just really really lazy.</TEXT>
