    <TITLE>Games that use paddle for shifter</TITLE>
    <DATE>2016-05-19 10:08:55</DATE>
    <TEXT>Folks, If you have an H-shifter, are there any recent sims that you use the paddle for shifting for realism? I ask this because my G29 left paddle is broken, and I'm lazy to RMA as it takes 2 weeks to RMA here :(</TEXT>

    <TITLE>Spending 250+ USD more on shipping!?</TITLE>
    <DATE>2016-05-19 10:24:03</DATE>
    <TEXT>Folks, My Vive is currently in my forwarder's US warehouse ready to be shipped to me here-- BUT as it contains a sticker for Lithium Batteries, they leave me with the below choices to ship: 1) 115 USD to ship via SEA-- 60 calendar days wait!! 2) 365 USD to ship via AIR -- 10 calendar days to wait. So..... If you were me, would you spend the extra 250+ USD to get it in 10 days, or take the hit, pay less shipping, but get it in 2 months :( Oh well.</TEXT>

So, does the Chaperone boundary include the boundary defined by the controllers so that if I define the bounds say 6 inches from my monitor, I won't be banging the controllers in my monitor? I hope my Vive arrives here a few days from now-- it's been in my forwarder since May 13th..</TEXT>

    <DATE>2016-06-09 13:56:18</DATE>
    <TEXT>Folks, I noticed that there are quite a couple of games whose developers are prioritizing Rift over Vive support-- is this because the Rift has had a long history already with the DK1 and DK2, or is it because Oculus are bankrolling/funding these games? On the other hand, does this mean that the devs perceive Rift support as being more profitable due to the perceived larger user base for the Rift? Maybe Valve should be more active in funding devs as well?</TEXT>

    <TITLE>My Vive! Comparisons mostly with the GearVR</TITLE>
    <DATE>2016-06-10 20:32:27</DATE>
    <TEXT>Just got my Vive after 1 month in transit from my forwarder! First off: Simply great! I came from using a GearVR and I was still thoroughly impressed with the Vive. Point by point: 1) Set-up-- This is not really an issue, as all the cables are very well-labeled, and going to htcvive.com/setup and downloading the Vive installer and succeeding installation was quite straightforward. I experience a small issue wherein one of my controllers had difficulty pairing (blue LED on), but I manually paired as per instructions in the SteamVR "tooltips" and also advised by SteamVR to update all firmware. Things worked after that BUT I could not set up roomscale due to an error--- but in fairness, I think that was due to my Windows 10 installation which was kinda flaky even before getting the Vive. I backed-up my data, and did a clean Windows 10 install-- and everything was perfect. So I do NOT consider that a Vive issue at all 2) Image clarity--- well, I can only compair to the GearVR-- but golly, the picture was crisp and while there is indeed SDE (lesser than that of the GearVR), I do not notice any bluriness at all unless I obsessively look for it. 3) FOV--- again bigger than that of the Gear VR by a significant amount. I never felt "boxed" in using the Vive compared to the GearVR 4) Sense of scale-- again, big surprise over the GearVR, the objects were really "there"! This is something I never felt on the GearVR. On the GearVR I was never "there", I was only watching through a window-- in the Vive, though the window was there, I felt that the window was much less obstrusive. 5) Defects-- NADA, NIL, ZILCH! YAY! No stuck pixels, no unresposive controllers, or whatever! 6) Concern-- guys can you assure me that the controllers are at least "sturdy" because yeah, when you are in the moment, now I know the feeling-- you can't help but sometimes bump into a wall with the controllers :( (so far 1 bumped it 2x, my wife 2x as well). Hope I don't wreck it! 7) So there-- just my amateur impressions mostly comparing to what I have been using all these time, the GearVR. What a STEEEEEEEEEEEEEP UP! Lemme play some more now :) See ya!</TEXT>

A couple of questions: 1) Did I do any permanent damage to my screen using this seemingly incompatible HDMI cable? 2) Has anyone tried the branded Sony PS3 HDMI cable which says 1080p but says supports 4K at the back of the packaging (confusing eh?).

    <TEXT>i mean, I always thought that high-speed cables, at least from reputable brands, are made equal in that they deliver video from a source to an output--- but what makes the Vive screen different in that only seemingly random selected brands work as its HDMI cable? So far I got a generic high speed cable--- no go, all green pixels around the picture, and then I exchanged it for a Sony High Speed HDMI with ethernet cable-- now I get NO PICTURE at all. I then test an old Acer HDMI cable and voila, everything is perfect (just like the Vive-provided cables). So, why is the Vive screen so darn picky while normal sources of video seems to accept any HDMI cable at all? I'm pretty bummed at the Sony cable--- how can such a usually high quality cable NOT work on the Vive??</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Thanks Devs! I'll test it later: This update includes improvements to the user interface for better VR display. Experimental OpenVR support was added, too. The main menu will now be displayed in 3D space in VR mode. Pressing R will recenter the VR view inside main menu and play mode. ***Experimental OpenVR support was added, too. We do not own any HTC Vive, so we cannot test properly. We will fix issues as soon as we get feedback from our users. *** The application will automatically detect and use when an Oculus devce is attached using Runtime 1.3. When that is not the case, it will try to detect a device using the OpenVR API. VR controllers are not supported, yet. Mouse and keyboard are still required for interaction.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>What I mean is, is there a way to re-do the Chaperone boundaries without repeating the steps involving setting the "front side" and the floor calibration--- any way to just directly go to the tracing of the roomsize? I'm asking this because there are times I want to re-size the room due to i can easily move furniture around, but starting over from the top step is a bit of a hassle. Case in point-- I was playing Pong Waves and I preferred a certain room size (conservative boundaries because I might slam the controller), but then after this I want to play a slow game like Chair in a Room where I want to maximize my space with little fear of banging the controllers.</TEXT>

    <DATE>2016-07-16 22:37:14</DATE>
    <TEXT>Just finished the game! While overall I can recommend this as one of the polished titles for the Vive, I do have a couple of suggestions: 1) Make the game save per Wave to avoid frustration on later levels. Challenging and Frustration share a thin boundary-- but fun should be the focus 2) Why is survival mode only for 3 or 4 of the many levels? There are other maps I wish I could play survival mode on. And lastly... 3) (SPOILER ALERT) The end animation for the boss should be more "majestic"-- it was a bit of a letdown for me. Seems the game suddenly ends and a bit of "that was good, but I hoped there were something more awesome in store after the big bad boy is down" I still enjoyed the game though. It's a solid recommend for me. Hope a sequel is in progress :)</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I just got it--- and in short, it is GREAT!! I read a few reviews saying that it is hard to fit, and frankly that concerned me. But, when I got mine, it fit my Vive quite easily, and quite well too. What I like is that now due to the material, there is a little "stickiness" factor on the foamplate so that when I wear the Vive, the headset does not slide around like it did a little when I was just using the "naked" foam. Overall, I'm happy with it. Looking forward to the replacement foam I ordered as well :) I highly recommend this!</TEXT>

    <DATE>2016-07-22 12:59:52</DATE>
    <TEXT>So I spent some time checking random games (Brookhaven, Final Approach, Ping Pong games, etc etc), and I observed the Frame Timing in SteamVR. It turns out that if i turn off reprojection, I can only go to SS 1.2 so that almost all games have the frame timings below 11ms (i.e. 90 fps). This with a GTX980Ti (zotac amp extreme), i5-6600k@4.2GHz. Are my results about right? So for folks doing 2.0 SS, i'm sure you have judder or are doing reprojection right? Also, does it mean with a 1080 I can go only as high as maybe 1.5 SS with no reprojection to have most games across the board @ 90fps? Graphics are indeed so sharp even at just 1.2 SS :)</TEXT>

The moment I'm in my sniper "cave", I feel a VERY strong sense of presence, as if I'm really in that cave looking down on the ground. Looking down the "ledge" even induces vertigo. The gun feels its like in my hand as well. So what do you think brings in this sense of presence, and why some games do have this strong characteristic, while others not as much? I think in the case of "the Nest" the fact that I'm looking out a hole, kinda matches the view from the goggles/HMD, so it all aligns.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>For those who are wondering how big FOV changes are in changing faceplates (ie from default facefoam to, say, VR Cover 6mm facefoam), it's quite easy to objectively see the FOV change-- what I do is I pick a scene in a game, say, VR Ping Pong, where I can easily mark my position-- in this case I stand close to the edge of the virtual table, and then take a look at the number of spectators I see in one field of view. For info, the default faceplate with VR leather cover, i can see 8 spectators (4 each side of the center mark), and more than 9 spectators (4 and a half each side) using the 6mm VR Cover faceplate-- thus proving the significant increase in FOV.</TEXT>

    <DATE>2016-08-13 15:38:09</DATE>
    <TEXT>I was thinking of this-- from a "tongue in cheek" perspective, VR graphics quality can never match "flat" graphics simply because flat graphics will always be easier to render, thus, when graphics cards have enough power to render VR graphics at, say 4K, with 8x AA, and all the bells and whistles, then by that time, "flat" graphics will probably be 8K or somethin-- ergo VR graphics will always be a step or 2 behind what is possible with "flat" games or apps. Thus VR and flat games will always exist side-by-side with flat games representing the pinnacle of computer graphics, while VR the pinnacle of interactivity. This is different from 3D games eventually surpassing the availability, interactivity and accessibility of 2D games. What do you think?</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Thanks to the devs of QuiVR and PoolNation VR, Raw Data, etc who have implemented in-game SS settings! I wish more and more devs will follow suit as different games can take SS to varying degrees. At the moment, I have set the SteamVR SS to 1.0 (default) as there is no one setting that maximizes all graphical fidelity for every app. For instance, ATS/ETS2 judders horribly when I set SteamVR SS to 1.9, but Pool Nation can take 1.9 and the graphics are intensely richer! So thanks devs for beginning to implement in-game SS and wish more will do the same.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>From an optical perspective fov increases if the screensize and lens size is increased up to a certain point after which more complex lens or compound lenses are needed..so the question is, is the current FOV of the Vive and Rift the biggest that we can have right now without resorting to much more expensive compound lenses and larger higher res screens. I am thinking that a theoretical vertical increase in fov of around 10 deg and a horizontal increase of 20deg would almost be "natural" vision. What do you think?</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Folks, We live in a H amp;L since more than 35 years ago that has a title we checked at Registry of Deeds under the name of the original developer of the subdivision-- problem is we were not able to fully pay the arrears before, BUT no one has approached us to collect any amortization after my parents paid I think 1/3 of the arrears more than 30 years ago. Is there any way to know who holds our account and who should we pay to settle the arrears in order for the title to be transferred from the old original developer to our name? Thanks!</TEXT>

    <TITLE>SteamVR latest version issue: can someone check?</TITLE>
    <DATE>2016-08-30 22:45:23</DATE>
    <TEXT>Folks (i posted on the Steam Forums as well), I tried the SteamVR beta which was the basis for this new release of SteamVR, and in many apps, when you are using a foampad that positions your eyes closer to the lenses, there appears to be some sort of "shadow" in the periphery of the picture. It's hard to explain-- but try using a thin foam, like a VR Cover 6mm, and a game like VR Ping Pong and you will know what I mean. The previous release version DID NOT have this issue-- so when the previous beta was released as the latest version, the issue of course came back. Any way to revert to the previous non-beta version?? Again, try playing some games with a thin gasket or facemask, and you will see what i mean. Pay attention to your peripheral FOV. You will see some "movement" which was not there before this latest update.</TEXT>

    <TITLE>Globe Platinum Fiber New Plans-- what about us early adopters?</TITLE>
    <DATE>2016-09-02 09:11:41</DATE>
    <TEXT>I started on a Globe Fiber plan last March 2016 with the cost of 100Mbps back then at 3500php/month. Just a few weeks ago, they no longer advertise this plan, and instead have 100Mbps @ 2499php/month. I called Globe and they said that to "DOWNGRADE" to this 2499 plan, I must still pay 2x of 3500 PLUS 2000 "DOWNGRADE FEE" total of 9000php. WHAT THE HELL?! I asked them to escalate this case, and let's see what happens. Hindi naman sya "downgrade"-- eh nagmura na ang plans nila sa 100Mbps from 3500 to 2499php, tapos kaming mga early buyers na when the price was high, magbabayad pa para makaavail ng 2499 at THE SAME SPEED?!? Parang nagmura na ang presyo ng bilihin pero sa mataas na presyo pa ang charge sa akin for the 2 years lock in dahil bumili ako 5 months before nagmura? Huh. May similar ba dito sa situation ko with Globe?</TEXT>

I know he has hired some good people in the administration as well, so would it be reasonable to think that he at least has given the blessing for his men to run other aspects of the country as they see fit--- and the only condition would be that they clean up his "mess" when he cannot control his mouth? As he said, his mouth is his strength and weakness. What do you think?</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Sometimes, it's sad to think that since the Philippines was discovered by the Western World, we have somewhat become "second class" citizens in our own land. Now, with China and PD's acting like a China lapdog, it's even sadder to think that it may take a long time, IF EVER, we Filipinos truly feel like First Class citizens in our country. I mean, look, even if we hate to admit it, many of us look up to foreigners (Americans, Chinese, Europeans, Japanese, etc) as they do hold most of the big businesses here. In the corporate world, big bosses who visit our local sites are foreigners whom we show sometimes annoying "bow to the top dogs" deference. I hope that one day we can feel in our country like how Americans (esp white folks) feel in the USA-- that they are First Class citizens in their country-- commiserations to the non-white folks :( Rant off.</TEXT>

    <TITLE>In reality-- can the President really single-handedly chart the Philippines' future?</TITLE>
    <DATE>2016-10-21 01:14:08</DATE>
    <TEXT>I mean, even if PD pronounces this and that, could he really act as ONE MAN with a grudge to route the PH's future? Aren't there checks and balance in Govt to prevent this? I know he has the supermajority in congress and senate-- but will these folks really remain his allies if he starts really really crazy shit? What about the AFP? Will they follow the president blindly? On a related note, I remember that just after the Marcos regime, the Aquino gov't also had very ANTI-US policies (they kicked the US bases in the 90s), while it was Marcos who was VERY PRO-US. But after 30 years, the US is still an ally after all that shit. Now, if within 6 years, this "direction" by PD proves to be a success for the people, then I suppose, the next regime will continue what he started, but if the edges are frayed, and if this so-called alliance fail, then it's up to the people to ensure that the next president is someone more in-tune with the rest of the Filipino population. Isn't the success also of PD during the election a reflection of a piss poor job that Pnoy did? If the previous regime had done well in the eyes of the people, whomever Pnoy had endorsed would have won. So I guess, panapanahon lang nga, and we all have to ride the tide so to speak in any case. What are your thoughts?</TEXT>

    <TEXT>This is not about the infinite replayability if games like Paddle Up or Pong Waves but rather about games with well-defined campaign or stories. I mean many good nonVR games have 15 or more hours of gameplay like Tomb Raider, Life is Strange, etc. On the other hand the best story based games for VR have at most 2 to 3 hours of play like Chair in a Room or Gallery. What's keeping devs from tackling these longer games? I mean even AA titles like Serious Sam is short compared to nonVR counterparts. Why don't we have these already given that some folks have been working on vr since the dk1 or dk2 days some years ago.</TEXT>

The transportation cost I spend in a month is MUCH lower than than the 12 to 15k amortization over 5 years I will pay for a car.

    <TEXT>Simply wow! One of the big advantages of the Rift was the smooth VR experience esp for cockpit and driving games--- with one fell swoop, Valve has basically taken that away. I just cannot believe how ETS2 and ATS are smooth as silk now at the highest settings--- coupled with the great work of CrossVR on Revive and Dirt Rally--- this is one hell of a game changer, well at least for many of us who were really seriously considering getting a Rift just for cockpit and driving games. Now, there simply is no reason to do that. Saved a lot of money for the next gen instead. So, thank you thank you Valve, and CrossVR--- you complete me haha! :) PS: Games such as Raw Data and Solus Projects are smooth as silk as well (except for the slight judder in the hands, which is not so bad), so is Serious Sam all at ULTRA! WOW! Using a GTX980Ti and i5-6600K by the way.</TEXT>

Tipong bine-brainwash tayo to accept na may chaos sa bansa para sa iron-fisted rule nya. But I think it won't succeed because to be honest I think there are more powerful people running the govt and not this clown president.</TEXT>

If a restaurant doesn #8217;t offer half cups of rice, then people will just deal with an entire serving or head somewhere else. Senator Marcos Jr. didn #8217;t have to waste his time for this.

So far, it's just the addicts I read being eliminated-- no other real things happening in the country, i.e. we are still US allies, we are still NOT under martial law, etc. Why do I get this feeling that someone else or some other group is running this country, and they are just allowing Digong to speak mindlessly all the time?

    <TITLE>I would love Federer to win on Sunday; so Nadal makes me VERY scared :(</TITLE>
    <DATE>2017-01-26 14:24:45</DATE>
    <TEXT>Ok, with all due respect to Dimitrov--- I will just focus on the hypothetical (for now) Fedal Sunday Final. We all know that aside from Federer's last GS win over Nadal at Wimby 2007 Finals, and his last win over Nadal last Basel on fast indoor at the Basel 2015 Finals, Nadal has owned Federer at the Slams due to the matchup issue with Nadal's high bouncing spinners and Federer's relatively weaker one-handed backhand. The irony is that if Wawrinka won, I will be more confident of Wawrinka beating and putting a beat down on Nadal on Sunday-- but now, I'm scared because I don't want to put up with another heartbreak loss for Fed care of Nadal and his bad matchup to Fed. DAMN!! So for you analysts and Fed fans out there, are there any facts or signs that may point to a Federer win should he face Nadal on Sunday on this court where he had lost to Nadal 3x already (Finals 2009 in 5 sets, 2012 in a heartbreaking 4 sets, and 2014 in a demolition 3 sets)? If the court were the grass of Wimby or the old Rebound Ace, I will feel better about a Fed win, but knowing how high-bouncing and SLOWWWW this Plexicushion is, I AM SCARED! So anything to allay the fears and anxiety this Sunday? Go FED! Win or Lose your overall record makes you the GOAT, but DAMN, please beat Nadal (or Dimi) this Sunday!!!!!!!!!</TEXT>

    <DATE>2017-01-29 17:38:11</DATE>
    <TEXT>Folks, I think I agree with Fed saying that playing Nadal so many times before and losing affected his mental game against Nadal (i.e. his walloping at RG2008 affected his Wimby2008 play)-- and not having to play Nadal for quite some time, with the last time a win at Basel in 2015, implied as contributing to him playing more freely and more as "FED" against Nadal. Now, do you think, he hasn't played Djokovic for 1 year already-- when they meet again, does Federer possibly have the upper hand now against Djokovic esp in GS finals? I was really sad seeing him lose that Wimby 2014/2015 to Djoko. The US Open 2015 was easier to digest because after all Djoko's favorite surface is hard courts. But losing on grass.. grrrr.. :(</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I mean he was as stubborn as sheet with his Drug War even amidst all international condemnation--- but now, rightly so, he has stopped this stupidity in a vow to cleanse the PNP of its scalawags after the Jee incident. All these months, he was "go PNP, I lick your ass, you go free, do what you like", then all of a sudden, he paused the Drug War and is severely critical of the PNP? At the same time the AFP is at odds with him. So what do you think is the cause behind these developments? Is it really Jee's death? Where is the sudden pressure coming from after all these months and all the deaths? Why now?</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I am so annoyed when this happens--- the bus has no issue, no troubles, and all of a sudden, while you are already relaxing in your seat, the conductor asks the passengers to transfer to another bus. Looks like the main reason is that the bus wants to shorten its route due to a few passengers and thus the driver already wants to start a new journey, while not even reaching the endpoint of the current trip. Annoying as fuck.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Folks, First off, I do not like this psycho President we have now. CLEAR?! Now, I had been part of some discussions in other posts regarding addiction and folks who got killed along the way. What I noticed is that most of the posts are kind of the "bleeding hearts" style towards druggies-- now i am not saying they should be killed! i am merely saying, what can they do to avoid being killed but at least stop now so they MAY increase their chances of being targeted. This left me thinking: Are these pro-addict arguments and posts by some here actually just an offshoot of the fact that many here hate PD? Would you have the same thoughts if other presidents have put a similar environment that treats druggies as pariah's?</TEXT>

Nope, I assume she realized hindi naman ganun ang kapit nya, at binabayaran lang sya for her services to "trolldom", ergo she is dispensable. When her use is up, or if she demands too much, she will be smacked down hard 2) Andanar -- A few days ago, obviously was put in his place by the admin. We will see how this will end up for him 3) Lavina-- fired by the admin 4) Sass-- wala pa naman. Maybe in time when she demands for more, she will get smacked down hard I think this admin has real allies and real cronies, and these are the people we should be watching and focusing on (Arroyo, Marcos, probably Alvarez, etc), as these are the real power within this admin. On a side note, I find it real funny that many DDS think Mocha or Sass can simply ask P. Diggy what to do, and P. Diggy grants it-- OMG, hindi basta basta susunod si P.

    <DATE>2017-03-14 22:39:21</DATE>
    <TEXT>For TennisTV subscribers, how do you watch TennisTV spoiler-free? What i mean is, once you open TennisTV, there is no spoiler-free page, and you may inadvertently know the results before you can even access the replays page. Also when watching replays, is there any way to hide the "time" slider? This is because you can actually know already who wins just by watching the first set and checking the TOTAL length of the time-slider, say the first set took 1 hour, and the whole match is 1.5hrs, then you can pretty much say the match was won in straights. So, again, what are your tips on having s spoiler-free replay session using TennisTV replays?</TEXT>

    <TITLE>In your opinion, which is more nerve-wracking..</TITLE>
    <DATE>2017-03-18 22:02:19</DATE>
    <TEXT>.. for an up-and-comer: 1) facing one of the big 4 in an early round or 2) surviving (1) then facing a lower ranked player in the FINAL of a big tournament? I think scenario 2 is more nerve-wracking as there are SO FEW players who have upset a big 4 member and then went on to win a final of either a masters, GS or a 500 level event. maybe because in the lower rounds, facing a big 4, they have nothing to lose--- but once they reach the final, even if they face a lower ranked player, they feel the "what if" of winning or losing the tournament.</TEXT>

    <TITLE>Anyone successfully get multiple loans from different banks approved?</TITLE>
    <DATE>2017-03-19 15:04:55</DATE>
    <TEXT>I have one on-going loan with "Bank A" which I pay diligently, no issues. In fact this is my 2nd loan with "Bank A" after I fully settled my first loan with them some years ago. So they gave me a renewal loan with no further ado. The thing is, I need some more lump cash at the moment for some urgent home improvement work esp as we approach the rainy season, and I was thinking of getting a similar value loan with another bank, "Bank B". Has anyone successfully gotten approvals on such different loans simultaneously with 2 different banks? Financially, I can pay the monthly dues no issues-- it's just that I need some significant lump cash at the moment for these house works</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Now that we have the Federer-Nadal thing going upside down, shall we move on to Federer-Djokovic Phase 3 (Phase 1 being when Fed was all over Novak, Phase 2 was when Djokovic was preventing Fed from winning all these Masters and GS Finals from 2014 to 2015)? I wonder how Phase 3 will play out. No disrespect to Andy Murray-- but Federer has always got his number and seeing them play in 2017 will not be as interesting to me anymore as Fed-Nadal or Fed-Novak :)</TEXT>

    <TEXT>The SJW feminists trolling GQ are crazy. Isn't it obvious that when they said Federer is the GOAT---- we are talking about MALE TENNIS? They can say Serena is GOAT--- and we are then talking about FEMALE TENNIS. Since when has it been accepted to talk of the MEN's and WOMEN's tennis as ONE ENTITY? It's like saying, the BEST MOM  gt; BEST DAD. Can't we accept that we should NOT compare them in the first place? APPLES AND ORANGES-- when has this concept disappeared? Fuck, this makes me angry.</TEXT>

    <TITLE>I have re-watched Fed vs Murray Wimby Final 2012</TITLE>
    <DATE>2017-03-23 17:52:16</DATE>
    <TEXT>.. and have seen that Fed was also unusually aggressive in his returns that is why Murray was under pressure all the time esp in Sets 3 and 4. Now, why did Fed NOT CONTINUE doing this after this match? He was back doing chips on backhand returns for a few years, and being quite mediocre on returns after that and consequently lost quite a few GS finals against Novak from 2014 to 2015. So is this aggressiveness esp on the backhand really new, or does it just make a "seasonal" return for whatever reason? Am I seeing it wrong?</TEXT>

    <TITLE>helping a friend in need- secured loan?</TITLE>
    <DATE>2017-04-10 13:26:13</DATE>
    <TEXT>First off, I must admit that I do not lend money to friends-- it will just be the source of issues later on. Having said that, I promised my friend I will try to help her out: She is currently paying off a housing loan from a bank for a condo unit she brought around 7 years ago-- she is almost halfway in her payment, and no missed payments or any issues. Recently, for personal reasons, she needs some extra cash (to the tune of a few hundred k's pesos). She has tried personal loans from banks but seems that her already existing housing loan is preventing banks from approving her needed cash loan. Is there any way for her to maybe acquire a secure loan with the condo unit as collateral? The condo unit is still being paid off by her, but as I mentioned she is around half-way already and has never missed a payment. In the US, I think this is a "second mortgage"-- I'm not sure if this is also possible here in the Philippines. Any banker or real estate expert chime in?</TEXT>

Any idea why we have this difference? I mean kawawa naman ang Call Center folks natin?

But, if he has no motivation to win FO, why even play it, why not just play again straight at Stuttgart/Halle/Wimby? This decision to skip ALL Clay Masters, yet play at FO baffles me..</TEXT>

    <TEXT>This is regarding Nastase's comment on Serena's baby with her Caucasian fiance. As an Asian, I don't understand why the "chocolate and milk" comment is considered racist as per definition of "racist": "rac #183;ist  #712;r #257;s #601;st/ noun 1. a person who shows or feels discrimination or prejudice against people of other races, or who believes that a particular race is superior to another. "the comments have led to her being called a racist" synonyms: racial bigot, racialist, xenophobe, chauvinist, supremacist More adjective 1. showing or feeling discrimination or prejudice against people of other races, or believing that a particular race is superior to another." In fact my wife, who is Asian as well, found the phrase to describe the baby as "cute". why is it racist to mention a person's skin tone? Mine is brown, my wife is brown as well-- as we are an Asian race of brown skin tone. I don't feel any implication of "racial superiority" as to to the "chocolate and milk" comment.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I was just thinking--- given that there is no such thing as "welfare" in our country where you can declare bankruptcy and get gov't support, what will you do if you really run out of money and cannot find a job? will you swallow your pride and apply to jobs that you consider under demanding of your skills? (i.e. you are a skilled programmer, but will you accept a job as a fastfood waiter-- well i know this is OA because IT is in demand, kaya nga example lang!) On a related note, with our high taxes comparable to western countries, why do we NOT have a "welfare" structure in place anyway?</TEXT>

Will Martial Law be the law of the land? will he ban all muslims ala Trump, and shut down the SC if they reject his EOs? Fun speculations are welcome.</TEXT>

    <TITLE>trading stocks on bigger money</TITLE>
    <DATE>2017-06-06 15:14:16</DATE>
    <TEXT>guys, how do you assess the liquidity of a stock vs your available equity? what i mean is, say, you trade 5k then almost any good stock will be liquid to you--- but what if you begin to trade bigger money? how do you decide the stock size you buy and trade with? I assume you will not trade 1M dollars on just one stock with average trade value of 5M, right? In that case your 1M will be 20% of the average trade value and so goodluck finding buyers and sellers with your 1M on that stock. So, how do you calculate the max cash you invest on a stock relative to the, for example, average trading volume or value? in general how do you trade bigger amounts without resorting to so many stocks in your porfolio which may dilute profits?</TEXT>

    <TEXT>..I find myself always rooting AGAINST him when he comes against bigtime players at the sharp end of tournaments. Why? Not because of his tennis, not because I do not like him--- but because he more than most has a high probability of getting injured in the next round and wasting the opportunity for his opponent. I mean, say this match goes to 5, Murray vs Nishikori, and Nishikori wins 8-6 in the fifth-- I will bet that in the semis vs Wawrinka, Nishikori will retire, and we lose the most likely epic Murray vs Wawrinka match. I dunno maybe I am just tired of seeing Nishikori waste his skills on such a fragile body.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>My setup is as follows: i5-6600k GTX980Ti Since a few weeks ago, I am not able to run VR due to the PC turning off after a few minutes in VR. I have set at default CPU and GPU (no overclock), and same thing happens. 3dmark benchmarks also reboot the PC, while some games like Mafia 2 and Portal 2 runs fine. Some have suggested that it is either the GPU or the PSU (Corsair VS650). I also have the latest GPU drivers from Jun 9. Any ideas? This PC used to run VR quite well.. now, it simply won't run for a few minutes at a time-- and with the SteamVR Beta, the first press on the controller sends the PC on a reboot.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>This is weird. Just this afternoon my LG G4 turns off and the the battery heats up even when turned off. This makes me think there is a short somewhere. The phone appears to be ok when plugged into a charger but once charger is unplugged, even at 70% battery, the phone reboots after a few seconds, and this happens seemingly on a loop; that is, the phone boots to the OS then after another few seconds or at most a minute or so, it reboots again. Any idea what can be the problem? I have now disconnected the battery from the phone in fear of the battery exploding as I mentioned that the battery heats up when installed on the phone even if the phone appears off. i will have it checked out in a few days but in the meantime, any ideas what the issue is?</TEXT>

    <TEXT>.. but this year, the Draw doesn't seem to matter too much if at all. AO2017: Won, on the way facing Berdych, Kei, Wawrinka, and finally Nadal. That is a tough draw IW2017: Won, on the way facing Nadal and finally Wawrinka. Again, tough. Miami2017: Won, on the way facing Berdych, Del Po, Kyrgios, and finally Rafa again. Halle2017: Final demolishing Alex Zverev Wimbledon 2017: Not losing a single set-- faced grass-dangers, Mischa Zverev, Dimitrov, Raonic, Berdych and finally Cilic. At the current form of Murray and Djoker, they will be lucky to get a set off Federer. Moving forward, Murray has never been a real problem for Federer, and the Nadal problem appears to have been solved at least on grass and hards-- so the only 'question mark' really is DJOKER. Although even at Djoker's peak, Federer can beat Djoker (their H2H is 23-22), but Djoker has been the source of quite a few heartbreaking losses-- AO2008/2011/2016, Wimbledon2014/2015 as well as USOpen 2015 to name a few. I want Roger to face his demons and demolish Djoker sometime soon :)</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Reading the political trends here, it appears that there are many here that usually bunch PDP-Laban current members as "DDS trolls", while many here regard LP current members as the "good guys". I am curious though if there are individual politicians that regardless of current party are usually respected or reviled in this sub. In this regard, can you name politicians from the current PDP-Laban which you think are OK, and on the other hand, can you name a current LP politician which may be tagged as "not to be trusted"? These are the politicians which defy party stereotypes. Past members are NOT included (i.e. don't include Cory or Nene Pimentel as PDP-Laban). Politicians must be currently active in politics. Let me start. I see that the Belmontes from QC as PDP-Laban as OK and not so "DDS'ish". As to LP, I still tend to view Trillanes as "antipatiko" and only in it for himself. Your nominees?</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I have thought of this some time ago. Which of these 3 bozos would have replaced by the BEST AND MOST IDEAL president ever? 1) Scenario 1: Trump and the chubs from NK remains, but instead of Duterte, we have the most ideal president for our country. Pro is of course local gains, but con is that the global scene still looks dire due to the 2 bozos from 2 nuclear powers. Maybe our ideal president can be a great diplomat as well and make sure we have the most advantageous place in case those 2 bozos nuke it out? 2) Scenario 2: the chubs from NK is out and replaced by the most peaceloving and best president ever! Now, at least on a global scale, we have one less bozo with nukes. But remember, Trump and the Duts are still there. We suffer locally for the good of the world? 3) Scenario 3: Trump is out-- we still have chubs and Diggy in. For me this is still the best scenario given only one of the 3 can be true in this hypothetical world. Trump will be replaced by the BEST president ever-- maybe ala the Abe Lincoln of our times. Maybe he or she can find a way to influence chubs as well as to get Diggy off his high horse? What do you think? Slow night at work haha!</TEXT>

Right now i could not for the life of me sleep-- just 1 or 2 hour naps in the past 2 or 3 days. I normally sleep at 3am and wake up 9am.. but yesterday, i lay in bed and had ZERO sleep. I did get a 2 hr nap in the afternoon.. and now Im not even sleepy.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>The people all had their backs turned away from the camera. What is the reason that many believe this is a video of Kian and the cops? Do we have a clearer version? I am trying to be a devils' advocate-- as there are two sides: One side claims the person in the CCTV is NOT Kian, while the other says it is Kian, and people will use either side as a fit to their narrative. Do we really have evidence whether that CCTV is a video of Kian or not? What made you believe or not believe whether the person in the CCTV is Kian? It is easy to believe either side if your mind is set on that side-- I want more solid proof in either case. Anyone point me to this?</TEXT>

PUTANG INA, sa kulungan o papatay ko kayo to set an example na ang pulis DI DAPAT TANGA!! What do you think? Very strange that Duterte is now suddenly "soft" and vowed cops will go to jail if proven guilty. His allies too are suddenly acting... quite out of the sipsip character. What gives?</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Parts List: Zotac 980Ti MSI Z70A Gaming Pro i5-6600K Corsair VS650 16GB DDR This PC had no issues for almost 2 years-- been using this with the HTC Vive for VR. Then around June this year, it began to reboot whenever I entered a VR game, and when I run the high end FiresStorm (on 4K setting) 3dmark. I continued to use the PC for normal desktop use, but I could no longer use it for VR since June. Now, since last week, every couple of days, even with ZERO overclocks, the desktop just reboots even without any game on. Any idea what should I have checked out first? Folks I have talked to suspect either the GPU or the power supply-- but because I have no spare parts, I cannot test and swap out for another GPU or power supply. I may soon bring this for testing at a repair shop-- but for now, any advice?</TEXT>

I also never have unplugged my phone before in the middle of the night as I always just keep it plugged until I wake up. Has this sort of stuff ever happened to any of you?</TEXT>

So, sa Pinas lang ba uso ang palagi kang tatanungin pag magasawa kayo na walang anak ng, "Kailan kayo magkakababy?" Tapos pag sinabi mo wala pa sa plano yan eh papangaralan ka ng mga rason bakit dapat magkababy ka na. Kakabadtrip diba!</TEXT>

I read EVERYDAY stories about people scammed by overpricers, Ponzi schemes, etc-- and yet seems day in day out so many people still get into these traps of giving their hard earned money to virtual strangers with sweet promises. Pinoy lang ba talaga or pareparehas lang ang tao sa kahit san na may madaling maloko talaga basta magaling kang manloko at may situation na prone sa panloloko?</TEXT>

    <TEXT>quo warranto is a loophole in the system-- it violated no law--- they just took advantage of the loophole. Fix it if needed, but kaya nga "remedy" yan eh, meaning it is a WAY to work around something, or in this case, to work around an impeachment. Walang illegal sa nangyari ngayon--- now, if they FIX it and prohibit that, eh di di na pwede gamitin ulit.</TEXT>

Nakabasa lang ng articles o news na anti-Duterte without really understanding the issue, eh feeling bagsak na ang Pilipinas while they live in their ivory towers. Mahiya naman kayo sa mga magulang, at elders ninyo na nagtiis at namuhay at yung iba yumaman sa Pilipinas dahil ang inatupag ay trabaho at ang maging may silbi sa buhay-- samantalang kayo dito ay ang alam lang ay magreklamo. I bet puro palamunin naman ng magulang ang mga to; tapos they threaten to leave the country kasi daw sinking ship daw tayo? LOL. What fun! Go ahead! LOL!</TEXT>

    <DATE>2018-05-22 14:07:56</DATE>
    <TEXT>I seem to remember when I was a kid/highschool, before the advent of mineral/purified or bottled water, we just took water from the faucet and boiled it-- put it in the ref and that was our drinking water. But, it was so long ago that I am doubting my memory a bit! So, anyone remember and can confirm? I guess my point is, in the absence of bottled water, is it safe to drink faucet water which in our case came from our subdivision tank? This tank gets water from Maynilad and is cleaned 2x a year. I also seem to remember that at school when I was a kid, we used to drink "poso" water.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Di na kayo nasanay sa mga style ng "oldies"! Sabi noon ni Ferdinand Marcos sa speeches nya nung kalaban nya si Cory, "Ano magagwa nyan as presidente eh babae yan? Para sa kama lang yan!" Oh, pero sa background diba ang balita eh under ni IMELDA si Ferdinand? O diba, joke noon ni Duterte na gusto nya maging susunod na presidente si Sarah kasi mas stricto pa sa kanya yun? The point is, all these are just TALK-- women have already proven themselves and they do not need to be "defended" as they have singlehandedly ascended to power even more than men (i.e. Imelda vs Ferdie, Margaret Thatcher, Indira Ghandi, etc). Talk is cheap, and it came from an "oldie" so just don't mind it at hindi naman forever ang termino nyan diba.</TEXT>

    <DATE>2018-05-24 14:49:16</DATE>
    <TEXT>After having the Vive for 2 years, I have suddenly come upon a weird issue-- every once in a while I will see some random pixel flash red. These are quite rare, like maybe once every 5 minutes, and in a different location each time. I only noticed because I stared into a black screen before playing a movie. I am sure it is not the movie because it happens even without a movie loaded and I also noticed it in Steam VR Home if I look really carefully and just stare at a steady scene. Is this screen damage or something less serious? Any idea how to fix this? i mean right now it is NOT that annoying, but let us say I was used to a 100% VR experience, and now it is just 99.99% due to these random red flashes which I now notice.</TEXT>

    <DATE>2018-06-05 03:39:44</DATE>
    <TEXT>Many here talk about women's equal rights, and yet they always ask me in my posts regarding the "issue" (or non-issue), "what if you were the husband of that woman kissed by Duterte"? My answer: So what? Can't a woman decide on her own without being controlled or judged by the POV of her man? Nillinaw na ng babae yung context ng smack nila ni Duterte, and yet many either bash the woman, or worse, seek to once again create controversy as a front to their deep seated "anti-DDS'ism". So what makes you different? You think you are right? Well THEY (DDS) think they are right as well. May iba pang naginsulto pa na panget daw Tatay ko. Jusko pareparehas lang kayo ng DDS.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>"Emmanuel Macron  amp; Brigitte Trogneux French President Emmanuel Macron met his wife Brigitte Trogneux when she was his Drama teacher at a private Jesuit school  #8211; he was 15, she was 40. At the age of 17, Emmanuel vowed that he would one day marry Brigitte and in 1997, that #8217;s exactly what he did. Age Gap: 25 years." So, disgusting ba yung wife nya for cradle snatching and "grooming"? My point? I am ONE WITH YOU in condemning VIC SOTTO for the pedophiliac rape of Pepsi Paloma. THAT was unforgivable and ultra-digusting-- but hitting the man for his relationship and marriage to Pauleen Luna just because she was a contestant in Little Ms Phils where Vic was a host-- and marrying her 21 years later--- eh grooming na daw at disgusting. Come on folks-- akala ko ba most of you are rationale people? Or rationale lang kayo sa mga perceived kakampi nyo? SMH.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>A couple of weeks ago, my PC began randomly having these "2 beeps" every few days or so, but seemingly without any other issues. I am not sure they come from the speaker or if my PSU or motherboard has a built in speaker tho, but they are high-pitched beeps that are similar to how motherboard beeps sound. My specs: i5600 at 4.2GHz Zotac GTX980Ti 16 GB DDR MSI Z170A gaming pro a couple of SSD and hdd Seasonic 750W PSU (I think it is 750W) Any ideas?</TEXT>

So I exited VR and went to Steam and checked my list of games and software-- and NO BIGSCREEN BETA! So I went to "Explore" in Steam Store, and searched for BigScreen Beta, and voila, it says "In Library"! WTF?? So I rechecked, and NO IT WAS NOT in my library. I went back to the BigScreen page in Steam and tried to "Play game" from there, and it fucking asked me to INSTALL the app! What just happened??</TEXT>

    <TITLE>Do Seasonic PSUs have some sort of "UPS"-like functionality?</TITLE>
    <DATE>2018-11-05 08:07:35</DATE>
    <TEXT>Not a full blown UPS, but some sort of protection during power fluctuations? I ask this because this has happened many times: 1) power in house flickers a little, with bulbs turning off and speakers turning off 2) monitor turns off 3) split second later, everything is fine. The strange part?? The PC has not turned off! When I turn the monitor back on, my work is as is--- no reboots no nothing, it is as if the PSU was able to provide some sort of very short term power even when the house voltage actually went quite low as to turn off other appliances. Amazing! NONE of my previous PSUs have done this---- when a flicker happens, PC automatically turns off or reboots. I'm impressed actually. Is this a feature of new Seasonic PSU's?</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Just wondering, I have this setup since 2016--- and it still plays most games at highest settings. In your opinion, how many years will I "need" to get a newer processor and gfx card before it gets too slow for higher game settings? Maybe 1, 2 or 3 years from now?</TEXT>

    <DATE>2018-12-17 20:05:29</DATE>
    <TEXT>Say you got 1k USD you are willing to lose EACH month-- then assuming you are at least ok on technicals and trade TA logically--- you can put a trade of relatively huge lot size, and trade till either you are wiped out or at 10k. If you get 25% of the year in profit in this manner-- that is, you gain 30k, and then lose 75% of the time, that will be 9k-- your net gain will be around 20 to 21k per year. The point being the more you are willing to lose that money and don't care, the more you gamble and the more you may actually profit at the end of the year.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>The point is that, only "rich" people can afford to let go of 1k a month no problem. This is different from casinos simply because there is still a strategy involved and GOOD TA-- but the lot sizes are HUGE. I am not saying one trade, it can be a series of trades until you get either 10k OR bust.</TEXT>

What I am confused about is shouldn't the grandma suffer injuries herself because the Ginger Dread Man hurts the person who "injures" the gingerbread and by whacking the ginger-stuff with a hammer, the grandma destroys the ginger-stuff, and she should have been punished instead of the church and the church-folks?</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Not exactly. I can conclude that without resorting to RSI. If you do a lot of back-tests, RSI divergences do not even account for 50% correctness. Any indicator that makes use of price in its formula is lagging by definition. RSI is no exception. What I am saying is that it is not the holy grail you make it seem to be, but if it works for your strategy then that is fine as well, but there are a lot of strategies that never uses it and still are profitable.  #8203;</TEXT>

    <TITLE>TSH sudden rise from 0.9 a few days ago to 8.00??</TITLE>
    <DATE>2019-02-05 14:31:50</DATE>
    <TEXT>This is making me nervous.  #8203; 9 or 10 days ago, I had some stomach virus that caused me diarrhea and a high fever and made me go to the Emergency Room. And because I said I am hypothyroid, they did tests and included a TSH test.  #8203; Nothing major was found, but they suspected something I ate as I had a bad reaction/fever and some pus in my Fecalysis. All other numbers were normal. My TSH was normal at around 0.9.  #8203; Now, I had been hypothyroid since 2010 after my RAI (used to be hyper), and my TSH had been well-maintained ever since.  #8203; Also, after the Emergency Room visit, they made me take some antibiotic and Pantoprazole for 6 days afterwards, and I just stopped taking those a few days ago.  #8203; Now, my regular TSH bloodwork came up yesterday, Feb 4th, and my TSH was at around 8.00 :(  #8203; This makes me nervous as my TSH hasn't reached those numbers since 2010, and it was just 0.9 nine or ten days ago when the ER labs tested it, but now its suddenly at 8.00.  #8203; I am scheduled to visit my Endo in 2 weeks. But before that, how can this happen? Is this something that can really happen-- a sudden spike from 0.9 to 8.00 in TSH in 9 days after my stomach problems??  #8203; I must admit, again, makes me nervous :(  #8203;</TEXT>

    <DATE>2019-03-03 18:00:45</DATE>
    <TEXT>Some stuff I read are scary like, "BE is a precursor to Cancer and is very serious." Some say that the incidence of BE progressing to cancer is so small that is should not be cause for alarm-- the 2/3 year monitoring is just a safety precaution.  #8203; What is the REAL facts on this?  #8203; Example of scary BE prognosis: [https://www.valleyhealthcancercenter.com/cancer-services/barretts-esophagus-gerd](https://www.valleyhealthcancercenter.com/cancer-services/barretts-esophagus-gerd)  #8203; Example of not really scary BE prognosis: [https://well.blogs.nytimes.com/2011/10/13/cancer-risk-from-barretts-esophagus-lower-than-thought/](https://well.blogs.nytimes.com/2011/10/13/cancer-risk-from-barretts-esophagus-lower-than-thought/)  #8203; My last endoscopy which was done because I had a long-term history of stomach issues, was around 5 years ago, and they just found some minor "scratches" and irritation as well as gastritis. GERD wasn't even mentioned. And definitely no Barrett's.  #8203; Thing is, the years after that, I kept on eating all the "bad stuff" like spices, acidic food, and now my throat/area under my chin feels inflamed for the past month that it "feels like something is there" I visited the ENT and said my throat was just slighly inflamed and gave me antibiotics. She dismissed any of my fears of anything else more serious. I am scared that maybe I have gotten something more serious since that last endoscopy 5 years ago? Barrett's? or even worse. Oh no, please.  #8203; I also read this: If the first screening test for Barrett's esophagus or esophageal cancer is negative, recurrent periodic upper endoscopy is not suggested.  #8203; So I was negative 5 years ago. Should I go get another endoscopy to make sure it's still not Barretts or anything serious?</TEXT>

    <TITLE>How do we know that it is SVT rather than VT?</TITLE>
    <DATE>2019-03-04 21:42:24</DATE>
    <TEXT>Very rarely, I will have these 5 to 10-minute episode of sudden high heart rate, above 180. I learned that this is probably SVT. I have already seen a cardiologist and he did all sorts of tests and concluded my heart is structurally normal and there is no worry. But he no test has ever been able to catch these rare "racing heart" issue of mine. I have had these since I was a kind, decades ago. And I do have them every couple of months or sometimes there will be 1 or 2 years between "attacks". Now I have been reading about VT and this seems to be dangerous kind of arrythmia because there is a chance if can go to Vfib. Yeah, we anxiety sufferers are a hypochondriac bunch. So how do I know what I have all along are SVT and not this more alarming VT episodes??</TEXT>

    <TITLE>Dry-heaving and Anxiety attacks</TITLE>
    <DATE>2019-03-09 21:18:16</DATE>
    <TEXT>I have been having anxiety issues since more than a decade ago. I will be able to bring it in control with meds, and then I'd taper off meds again to see if the anxiety comes back. And as we all know, it usually does. I have not taken meds since around July last year, and of course since a week or two ago, it seems my anxiety is going forward at high gear again. Now normally when I am anxious, I feel nauseated and I dry-heave. But I was thinking, what if I somehow suppress my dry-heaves, anyone with similar symptoms try it? I mean, when I do my dry heaving, my anxiety seems to dissipate, but I'm afraid I may be physically damaging myself doing all these strong heaving. My whole throat and chest feels sore after a bout of these dry-heaves and coughs when I am anxious.</TEXT>

    <TITLE>So what now for extension? Amazon basics cable is a bust</TITLE>
    <DATE>2019-03-16 21:52:00</DATE>
    <TEXT>2 years ago, I bought an Amazon Basics 15 ft HDMI extension cable for my Vive. It worked flawless for almost 2 years. Last year, it began to develop flashing red pixels all around the field of view. So I swapped cables with the original HDMI and it was perfect again. I used my extension USB with the orginal HDMI, still perfect. In other words, the issues seems to stem from the 15 ft Amazon HDMI cable.  #8203; So I just bought a new Amazon HDMI cable because what the heck it worked for 2 years right? But, brand new, I tried it just a moment ago, and I still get a few red pixels-- they are reduced from when I used the old Amazon cable, BUT they are still there nonetheless :(  #8203; So what now-- what can I do to extend these cables aside from getting the wireless adapter (not an option now!) or trying buy a lot of cables and see which one works (not also an option! If i buy another one, i must be SURE it works 100%).</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Yup. I will go see her this weekend. My fear is actually the reported heart arrthymias that are related to SSRIs (Long QT syndrome). Though after examinations and tests, my cardiologist tells me I am fit for SSRI's, everytime I re-start SSRI's I experience some skip beats which then subside after a few days. So that is my only concern actually with my Escitalopram. I also experience short episodes of possible SVTs though they don't seem to be related to SSRIs because I have them even before I took my first SSRI in 2015. As you know as an anxiety sufferer, one of our most common fear is our hearts :(</TEXT>

But today, I am left alone for 2 days and I am so afraid that starting this morning I have been having breathing issues like I cannot pull in sufficient air. Question is can one go from running stairs one day to having heart failure the next? I read that breathing issues can be caused by heart issues. Last time I my heart was checked was a year ago but Im afraid maybe my anxiety has damaged it or maybe I have pulmonary hypertension or embolism. Or is this really just anxiety? I took Xanax and I felt great but after 3 hours and while eating, the breathing issues are coming back :(</TEXT>

    <TITLE>Escitalopram Lexapro: Afraid to die from lack of sleep!!</TITLE>
    <DATE>2019-04-23 13:54:49</DATE>
    <TEXT>I know my concern is a little bit much. But I have that morbid fear. I have diagnosed GAD and hypochondriasis. I used to take Lexapro and it worked wonders for me. I then stopped taking it thinking I was ok. BIG MISTAKE. So starting around March I developed my GAD again and a deathly fear of serious diseases to the point that I suffer so much fear when I am left alone. My wife works the night shift and I work from home. On weekdays I developed a morbid fear of being left alone that my sleep became messed up when I know my wife will not be home (light sleep, waking up every hour or sometimes not sleeping at all). My doctor put me back on Lexapro which I restarted again last week. Now I am a total mess. I sleep well on weekeds when wife is here but not so much on weekdays when I know my wife will be out. So much so that I actually cannot sleep yesterday-- and I think Lexapro exacerbated it as an initial side effect. I cannot even get a wink of sleep this morning. Guys, I know Lexapro has worked for me in the past, but now with whatv I am experiencing, its hard for me to look forward to when that works. Can I die from no sleep and from whats happening now? Will Lexapro ever kick in again and set my head straight? :( I am so scared.</TEXT>

My head is all messed up as well because when I get anxiety attacks, I tend to dry heave and I fear I may be tearing my esophagus or something with the dry heaves :(</TEXT>

My fear is what I permanently am dependent on whether my wife is here or not?? I do not want to be like a toddler :( My main fear is breathing and the internittent feeling of a lump in throat. I am scared to choke alone.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>After around 4 weeks on Lexapro, I am happy that my anxiety has been in control and the side effects like shakiness, insomnia, nausea, etc has basically faded :) My concern though is that I think I have a mild pure OCD (for example, I see certain numbers as "bad" and some as "good" like when I think "I am healthy" and I look at the time and see 10:33 I feel upset because 3 is a "bad" number--- yeah nonsense but thats why it is OCD). It seems that these last couple of days, the effects of OCD has been a bit stronger and I find it harder to shake off. Is this normal and can I expect this to subside as well in the following weeks? I am at 10mg Lexapro.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>OK SPOILERS HERE. The ending is quite unbelievable. Elli's brother and Andy's own brother kills him as if its a casual thing to do? Aside from the class bullying, there was no.character development that pointed to Jake and Danny as murderous kids. It just happens lile that? So is Copperfield a school of demon idiots? Then the parents just cover it up as if it was nothing. SORRY, but the resolution seems to be so tacked-in. It may evoke dramatic flair and sadness, but otherwise it is very flawed in my perspective.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I still disagree regarding the build up. Yes there are shocking murders like this. BUT my main gripe was that the characterization and build up for this act of Danny and Jake was simply lacking for me. We can of course agree to disagree. This lack of strong enough motivations and build up made me say that it was like nothing at all. It still felt too much tacked-in to me. All the characterization was about Elli and Andy and all of a sudden we have relatively minor characters do the most dastardly act and denoument of the story. I just found that lacking.</TEXT>

    <DATE>2019-06-18 05:10:23</DATE>
    <TEXT>Since around a few months ago, just as I finished a rather forceful cough, I felt a sudden but VERY brief (less than 1 second) sharp pain (kind of similar to pain that I can describe as when you pull a bandaid from a hairy area?) near my RIGHT STERNUM, near the LOWER RIBCAGE. Now over the past few months, occasionally, and I have no idea of the conditions which trigger it (sometimes a normal cough, or a sharp movement), that pain occurs. It is still so short-lasting (less than 1 second), still feels like a sharp band-aid pulling sort of pain inside, and still in the lower right ribcage near the right part of the lower sternum. Now the health anxious in me says, "AORTIC DISSECTION!!!!", but the more normal mind inside me says, "It's not serious." So yeah, I'm finally having it checked by a doctor next week, but in the meantime, anyone else has this and what may cause it?</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Yeah. Sometimes a story loses it's value if it tries to be too cryptic. It kind of tries so hard to be mysterious but without some clarity, it just sounds like a pretentious artsy story. For me, I do agree on the body exchange part. But a lot of the story is like nonsense like the snakes dream, the "tell me what you fear' crap. Makes the story so pretentious in my opinion. Any other possible sense you can make out of that story? THANKS!</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I mean, I may be biased, but I noticed that more and more stories are of the "open interpretation" type but usually done sloppily that you feel all it does is build an ambiance, but zero plot or sense. I am re-listening to earlier seasons and it feels like more of the early season stories are just more "solid" and less of this recent trend. Cases in point to illustrate what I mean: The story in S12 about the evil car from "Cars". So it kills.. and then so?? The Elevator story of S13. He finds a floor with ghosts from a past fire.. and so?? Its just atmosphere but almost zero plot or development and denoument.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Nah, it's not really such a hard defeat-- remember for all of the match, it was Federer who was catching up in sets, and also Novak broke first in that fifth set, but choked that break back to Federer. Yeah, it was unfortunate that when Federer was able to break on his own and climb to 40-15, shit happens. In the end, the frontrunner won, no regrets.  #8203; The USO 2009 loss to Del Potro for me was much worse as Fed was the frontrunner most of the time in that match and the heavy favorite.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Don't get mad at me LOL. Just thinking out loud. Take this Wimby final for example-- it seems Djoker has let Federer in after winning a set with sloppy breaks of serves in the even sets. And lo and behold! We get to a fifth set-- Djoker breaks, Fed breaks back and has match points, Djoker breaks back-- and lo and behold, we get a "historic" first use of the fifth set tiebreak to 12. In the end, Djoker wins as per the "script" LOL.  #8203; To be honest? I am a Federer fan, but it seems Djoker could have finished the match way earlier, but was supposed to get to a fifth set, use the tiebreak for the very first time to make it "significant", but Djoker agrees to this as long as he isn't supposed to lose because in the first place, he could have finished off Fed as a 37-year old hours back if they were both "let loose with no strings"  #8203; Just a random thought. Too many "coincidences" to get us to a first fifth set tiebreak. Djoker seems to "fake out a fade" n the even sets to lead to the fifth.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I'm kind of torn here. I do love my OG Vive, but I feel it may be time to go try another headset that's going to have improvements over my old OG Vive. I was thinking of getting the Quest (to share watching movies with my wife) and also for some quick gaming-- and then recently, I also thought I may as well get a Rift S to upgrade my OG Vive as I've heard reviews of the Rift S good screen quality, comfort etc. The lack of audio can be fixed using a pair of headphones. Then, recently I have also thought of waiting a year or so and just save up for an Index-- but then some say the price differential between the Index and Rift S does not really justify the very slight improvement of the Index over the Rift S.  #8203; Especially to those who have tried the headsets, what are your ideas and opinions re OG Vive (which I have), Rift S, Quest, and the Index. I am mostly concerned over screen now as I read I can actually just go get Index Controllers later on and actually use that either with the OG Vive or with the Rift S as long as I keep my Lighthouses from my OG Vive with me.</TEXT>

The official Oculus site says to clean it with anti-bacterial wipes, but some sites suggest actually removing the interface and foam and handwashing with a little detergent or handwash detergent. Now, I can't wash it every time I use it since the downtime will be quite long (letting it fully dry can take hours!), so for those who wash it, how often do you do it? Like once a week? Then just wipe it with anti-bacterial on a daily basis? Oh, how I wish those VRCOVERs will ship soon-- September is their ETA :(</TEXT>

Does this mean I can now get a new router that supports dual-band, and use its 5Ghz band by connecting that new router to the 100Megabit ethernet of my ISP router, then connect the Quest to the 5Ghz band wifi of the new router and get smoother connection to the Quest?</TEXT>

But I'm kind of obsessing that maybe the slam could have caused some "internal" impact on the controllers as even if my knuckles kind of cushioned it, and it was just a hard plastic table, it was still a hard slam given I was happily Sabering away! So just wondering how durable are these controllers, especially the scary fragile-looking rings? What are your "slammin'" experiences? (I know, I know misery loves company haha!)</TEXT>

    <TEXT>And if so, can they be interchanged if I get also a Rift S? So how will the headsets know which is which if I got both? How would I be able to manually assign which set of controllers is to which set of headset? I have a Quest, but I also plan to upgrade my OG Vive to a Rift S to also get that rich PC experience-- plus the Rift S is so comfortable and comparable to PSVR in comfort.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Oh no. Thank God I was just slowly exploring Shadow Point and NOT playing some quick game smacking things around. But I took of my headset and when I resumed play, as I was exploring, my controllers bumped gently on a wall-- and guess what the Guardian was a few inches inside the wall!! It was perfect when I set it up. So I redid it and all is well. But wow, this is a dangerous issue-- anyone else experience this? Any permanent fix?</TEXT>

    <TEXT>This has not happened before, but just over the last couple of weeks. I am using ChromeOS Beta channel. Whenever I use my bluetooth headphones (Sony WH-1000XM3), it starts off fine, but after a few minutes, sometimes 10, 20, 30 minutes, the audio starts stuttering and the Chromebook stutters as well (trackpad cursors stutters, apps slow down), as if something is consuming a lot of resources. It is not just the audio that stutters, but the whole Chromebook seems to slow down.  #8203; Is this a known issue with the beta channel? Any known fixes for this aside from getting back to the stable channel and doing a powerwash?</TEXT>

    <TEXT>On average, more than $400 a month if you are serious about it and move up to different teams. There is no general consensus because people who post on Reddit are different-- either they expect easy money (which it ain't) or they are really dedicated (which some of us are). So what you earn depends on what YOU can be and the effort your are willing to give. This is true for any company. Now just judging from your first sentence, "very tedious application process", I think you are expecting easy free money with no effort at all. And you will be wrong, sorry. The application process is not tedious at all, but it also is not a piece of cake-- same with any company worth anything. So there.</TEXT>

Start with the earlier seasons, 3 to 8, and buy them season by season. Note that I do have all the seasons, the free S1 and S2 and all paid seasons thereafter.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I feel this match was lost rather than won. No one seems to want to take the match by the neck and win it. I mean, the last games of the 5th is a thesis on anti-momentum, nervousness and mental fragility. Then we come to the tiebreak-- oh, I will not say anymore. But still, the winner deserves kudos. I just hope these folks can at least approach the mental toughness of a Federer, Djoker, Nadal, Serena, Osaka, Murray. That fifth set was the antithesis of that. But again, CONGRATULATIONS to Dominic! (Sorry if this is full of backhanded compliments because, sadly, it is.)</TEXT>

But when I try to plug in my Firestick 4K there, no go, but when I use the powerbrick to an actual wall socket, everything's fine. I thought the Firestick 4K can be powered by a USB out at 5V/2A? For testing, I also tried powering it from my PC USB, and also no go. Only the power from the power plugged into a wall socket works.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Well, for me the Quest 1 strap was bad. I had to change it to the Vive Deluxe Audio Strap to be comfortable so that it does not get painful on my cheeks and forehead. So would the default Quest 2 strap predictably be bad for me as well?

    <TEXT>So I just ordered the Quest 2 256Gb. And I think my best course of action is that I will first try how the default strap works out, and then if needed, get the Elite strap or the one with battery, OR maybe by that time we will have some other third-party vendors selling more comfortable straps-- I watched the Upload VR Review of the Elite Strap with Battery, and it seems the comfort is not that impressive even with the battery built-in as counterweight. So.. maybe waiting for others to create more options will be a wise thing to do at this point.</TEXT>
