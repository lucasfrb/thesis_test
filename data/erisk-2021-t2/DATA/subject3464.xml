    <TITLE>The State of Deku's [SPOILER]</TITLE>
    <DATE>2020-10-13 14:56:40</DATE>
    <TEXT>Arms. Like his arms are non existent at this point right? When he fought Muscular he did 3 (4 if you want to split Delaware Smashes) 100% smashes on endorphins and his joints were badly deteriorated. I believe the doctor said that or more times and it could be gg for his arms. So where we are now, Deku's done a bit more than three 100% smashes (Unsure how many since some panels just show multiple air explosions), on both arms as well. Now granted I know that he is protected by plot armour, but his arm problem is gonna get addressed again. How yall reckon they gonna handle it?</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Prosthetic huh? Something similar to the full gauntlet that deku used. I actually thought about this for a while and completely forgot about a busted quirk that they have on thier side. Eri's Rewind. Granted we havent seen any proof that she can remotely even control it or that she even can. If she could tho, shed probably rewind Dekus arms to a point where it was usable again. This isnt the last time Deku is gonna go 100%, so until he can properly use it the prosthetic might..hinder it? idk, i have no idea what they might do.</TEXT>
