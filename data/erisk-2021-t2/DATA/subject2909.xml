    <TITLE>Clomid and immense anxiety</TITLE>
    <DATE>2020-04-06 20:51:32</DATE>
    <TEXT>Hi guys, New to TRT. I took Clomid for a couple of weeks because I didn't like the idea of T playing with my fertility. However I got pretty bad anxiety from Clomid, like way bad, randomly out of nowhere.. and 2 weeks after going off it I still feel it to an extent. Does anyone have experience with this? Now I'm on testogel but I'm curious whether HCG could work without the same effects.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I tried this for a week. On day 7 my anxiety was so high (something that wasn't there before) and my mood so low that I stopped. It's been 2 weeks and it's still bad to an extent, but different depending on the day.</TEXT>

    <TITLE>HCG dosage alongside TRT</TITLE>
    <DATE>2020-04-16 10:57:04</DATE>
    <TEXT>Hi guys, I posted previously regarding Clomid (clomiphene) making me feel like shit. I want to preserve testicle size and fertility if possible so I want to ask my doctor about HCG. I'm curious what dosage you guys are on? And if it makes you feel any different? Do you need estrogen blockers more? If so which ones do you recommend? Anastrozole? And dosage? According to some slides I read from: "U.S. Food and Drug Administration Bone, Reproductive and Urologic Drugs Advisory Committee" they pointed to a trial that had men taking 500 IU every other day alongside TRT. Showed only a slight decline in sperm motility. I'd really rather not inject myself every other day, and isn't that dose quite high? Should I be afraid of HCG making me feel stressed out like Clomid did? P.s. where do you store the hcg?</TEXT>

    <DATE>2020-04-16 17:27:46</DATE>
    <TEXT>Dosage was 100mg/day for roughly 7 days. I came off because on the 7th it spiked my anxiety so high and it remained so for a few weeks. Estradiol was 228 pmol/l (refernece 206? I don't get it, but elevated, is this a lot?) Testosterone 28,9 nmol/l Free testosterone 12,3 nmol/l Cortisol 687 nmol/l (reference 170 - 700) - I suspect either this or the estradiol of making me feel terrible. I've since come off Clomid and onto testosterone monotherapy. but curious to hear your thoughts, esp. regarding estradiol/cortisol.</TEXT>

Only time you get symptoms is when your ratio is out of whack. If your test levels are 1200 for example, proper estrogen levels would be 60-85 (220-320 pmol) My T at the time was 800 ng/dL.

    <TEXT> gt;As stated: unless you want to retain fertility, or you're worried about your balls shrinking (it's really a minimal change), there's little reason to have it in your protocol. I know there's talk of back filling LH receptors and pathways and all that, but I've been over a year without it now and feel better with just testosterone cream (switched about 6 months ago), DHEA, pregnenolone and Armour to get everything optimized. Super interesting to read. I'm on the cream (or gel) my self, never tried anything else except Clomid for a week. You prefer the gel over the injections? But you take DHEA; pregnenolone and Armour as well? Why DHEA? I thought the body was responsible for turning T into DHEA, DHEA-S and DHT. And what is pregnenolone and Armour?</TEXT>

    <TEXT> gt;It #8217;s also very important to find the right mask. Most masks are bulky and uncomfortable. I probably tried 7 or 8 different masks before finding what #8217;s best for me. My favorite mask, by a long shot, is the Phillips Dreamwear Nasal Cushion (not pillows). That's super interesting. I need to look up some of the things you sent. I have some form of the ResMed machine and I'm not really a fan of the constant pressure. I had nasal pillows but the air pressure in my nose really dried it so that ir hurt in the morning. So I changed to a nasal mask but then stopped for a bit because I have a cold.</TEXT>

    <TEXT> gt;Yes. It took me 6 months to get through a whole night. Many (most?) people get used to it faster than that. Stick with it. The rewards are huge. That first, normal waking time, morning when you take it off to get out of bed.... You'll feel amazing. I've got used to it now after five years. Now I struggle to sleep without it. It's my little sleep machine. Get the tube so it leaves your bed, above your head. So your arms don't tied up with it while you dream sweet dreams. . My cpap is called Brian. Brian's my friend :) Haha, thats' an amazing reply. I don't know what my main problems have been so far. I started with nasal pillows but woke up with dry mouth and it dried my nose so that it hurt in the morning. Then I switched to a full-nasal mask and got through the night (still waking up, still a bit more uncomfortable than sleeping with nothing). I've not yet given my machine a name, maybe I should. Was there any setting / mask that made the difference for you?</TEXT>

I've seen some improvements, especially with fatigue. But I still feel like it could be better. Is it too soon to go to a whole dose? Does this keep improving?

But this soon turned, fatigue is still better, but I #8217;ve felt anxiety and way too emotional. I have had a blood test were estradiol was raised somewhat considerably. 62 pg/mL. I #8217;m pretty sure I #8217;m aromatising a lot, I #8217;m not overweight.

    <TEXT> gt;I think you will see an improvement of symptoms just from changes in application site and the addition of turmeric with some piperine added every day. It should be available from any supermarket if you don't already have it at home. You may also want to consider lowering the dosage of the gel a bit. I'm sure you've tried to increase it but that is the opposite of what you want, it would most likely make you feel worse. It is a start at least but otherwise, aim for nebido if you are certain TRT is the route you want to take. You're correct, I did increase it from 25mg to 50mg for a couple of days.. still recovering from that I think. Went back to 25mg and now to \~16.5mg for the past 3 days as well as a little arimidex (0.25mg 1x). Definitely will try the turmeric + piperine. What scares me about Nebido is the half life, if I mess it up I don't want to be messed up for weeks. You seem super knowledgeable about this, are there any resources you use to learn about this? And could you tell me a bit more of your story? As in what you've been using, how you felt, etc.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I definitely felt the increased anxiety but I seem to be settling in at a way lower dose. I'd advise (not a doctor) to take as little as you can, and ramp it up slowly. You won't know how a certain dose affects you until you've token it for a few days. I've been on it only a short time myself. As for HCG/Clomid, can't really tell you what will work, but I had some semen frozen myself. I've heard with HCG/Clomid that if you take it for a prolonged period of time it will become less effective, not sure if that's true. But maybe it works better as a post-testosterone thing rather than a constant thing.</TEXT>

On an unrelated note, I started with the average dose of the gel.. or around 3/4 of 50mg, got really emotional and anxious. went down to 1/2 and now 1/3 and at 1/3 I'm feeling somewhat better and the emotional thing seems to be gone. I both lowered the dose and minimised the area that I apply the gel to. I read a book by dr. Krisler where he mentioned something that makes sense to me.. i.e. that in the skin there is more aromatase, so the least area you get away with applying the gel to is best. There's also more of the ....something-reductase that makes DHT which might be why it's stimulating hairgrowth so well.</TEXT>

Had lunch with a buddy during mid 30 #8217;s, he was on trt. I thought nothing of it at 1st. I thought I felt fine, but was curious again. Went and got tested, low 300 #8217;s and way low free. Got an injection that day. Looking back, I had low T symptoms for some time and had no idea. Many symptoms took over a year to clear up. I never felt good enough, worthy, insecure, doubtful. I tried coming off once and felt the old me coming back, it was scary. In 4 years, I #8217;ve tripled my income. Giving my wife sex that she craves, learned about manhood, stopped pondering the meaning of life, understood I wouldn #8217;t die if I was alone, understood I was the prize and a high-value man.

    <TEXT> gt;I got my first bloods pre-TRT recently and my prolactin was 34 ng/mL (ref range: 4-15). My free T was then low at 6 pg/mL (ref range: 9-26) which may be due to high prolactin (as prolactin inhibits LH production - my LH levels were also low and low LH causes low T). My doctor suspects it might be a prolactinoma (benign tumor on the pituitary), but can't get an MRI to confirm due to Covid. He prescribed cabergoline, but it can have some scary side effects.So, instead, I've been taking 100mg of P5P a day and plan on adding 400IU of Vitamin E and 800mg of SAMe here soon as well, all of which have been noted to lower prolactin in studies. It's been about a week and I do feel somewhat better, I've gotten morning wood and libido the past few days which I haven't had in many months. I'm going to stick with this for 6 weeks or so and get my levels tested again before considering TRT.Hoping on TRT is a huge lifelong commitment, so if you have high prolactin, I'd try lowering that first. Interesting, I'm getting an MRI next week. I'm going to look into those. So P5P alone seems to be making you feel better? Have you been feeling any anxiety / emotional?</TEXT>

Testosterone aromatizes to estradiol and estradiol can spur further prolactin production, which could be what the adenoma is making.</TEXT>

I go into fight-or-flight (flight) after working out... sometimes to the point where I can't sleep, not very often.. but I really think cortisol is a part of this, but I wish I would've had prolactin checked on the same test. I just need this to be solved. But interesting to hear your thing. I really would like to just have it surgically removed in any case.</TEXT>

Anyway, if you didn #180;t know about the existence of those hormones now you have work to do and this may be a good starting point, is not test what fucks your mind, is the absence of other hormones we supress when we introduce exogenous T. Interesting to read this about pregnenolone and DHEA. However.. couldn't these same effects be from raised estradiol, or even prolactin? Raised estradiol raises prolactin. Prolacitn has been shown to raise anxiety / hostility in women at least.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Not a doctor and don't know anything. But flare ups have been noted with most autoimmune diseases in women after pregnancy. Some studies connect higher prolactin levels to increased autoimmune activity. Prolactin levels are raised when you breastfeed. Don't know if this helps, but maybe look into it, and maybe breastfeeding might not be the best option. But again I don't know, it's just something I read.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>None, and no T. I haven't quite found my spot in this and I'm not sure that my case will align with yours. My primary symptoms are insane fatigue and possibly some autoimmunity. So.. I've been on plenty of Omega 3 oil, research shows that it decreases inflammation and may even work as well for depression as fluoxetine (20mg). Then some P5P.. which may help with serotonin  amp; dopamine. I think my trouble is more with those than with E2. But who knows, we'll see. In any case I'm feeling less fatigue (definitely not perfect) and less emotional. Still not perfect but getting closer.</TEXT>

Out of curiosity, why did you look into the immunosuppressive properties if you have type 2 diabetes? I haven't looked much into type 2, but as far as I remember you see many of the same inflammatory markers raised as in type 1 (and other autoimmune disorders / sleep apnea). Testosterone greatly reduces for instance IL-6 and TNF which are often associated with fatigue in these diseases. The insulin sensitivity sounds good too. And as for autoimmune.. it does other things as well.. less B-cells and so on.</TEXT>

Gluten is entirely out for me, and honestly most corn and whatnot or even carbs don't seem to go too well. Dairy I skip too. I'm going to try to move to mostly meat and boiled veggies. I've been taking methylated B6 which I feel like has helped with being tired, and B12 and B9 (folate) I've taken less consistently. I take 9mg boron/day. 20ml Omega 3 (can't remember ratio of EPA/DHA). I feel like that helps to an extent. You can read research about it reducing inflammatory markers. Another thing I started taking recently and feel like has made an improvement is a ton of magnesium. around 500mg of carbon in hot water in the evening, 500-1500mg oxide in the morning. And most recently added acetyl L-carnitine. I can share research on these if you're curious. But we'll see how well it works, I haven't stuck to any of this for long except the O3.</TEXT>

No body or facial hair, gyno, anxiety, hotflashes, metabolic syndrome in late 20s. Hmm.. man. Well I guess in any case you'd want to shoot for the PRL at the lower range. I don't know much for that except.. if you have a prolactinoma there's cabergoline. Dopamine in general inhibits prolactin. There's one study showing a very high dosage of vitamin B6 having a similar effect on high PRL as the dopamine antagonists (cabergoline, brome..something). 600mg I believe it was. And some evidence for vitamin E. Other than that, control your E2 I think would be sensible. E2 will stimulate prolactin. However.. I've.. experienced "hot flashes" or something similar with AI, so I don't know.. maybe just try to keep it in the low-normal range. But I'm not a doctor so what do I know.</TEXT>

The studies are small and sparse but they've found that children with autism become more social/feel better on it. It works by blocking the opioid receptors in the body for 2-4 hours at those doses. The body responds by making more endorphins and more opioid receptors.</TEXT>

    <TEXT> gt;yep - accidentally injected 55 or 60mg instead of 50mg almost a week ago, heart still beating like crazy at night when I try to sleep now, including last night. My sleep tracker seems to suggest my first hour in bed is in the "awake" state. When I do eventually fall asleep, I sleep through the night, with 20 - 30 % of my sleep in deep / rem sleep. I used to be able to sleep for longer too - Now I'm ranging between 6 and 7 hours per night. And 50mg was fine for you? At what frequency are you injecting? 50 seems quite low.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Yeah, could be sleep related. I get mild symptoms during the day too though. But I read that study, was interesting to read. I guess I'm wondering if I keep this up whether things would mellow out and start working better at this dose. I also read some studies saying something akin to "perhaps hormone fluctuations" had more to do with anxiety than absolute levels of hormones. Sleep got wayy worse as I mentioned though, waking up with heartbeat / anxiety symptoms, but also some of the same during the day.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Yes, gels, and yes. But I took the maximum dose (2 bags.. 100mg). And.. distributed, so some of it I took after 5 PM. It's hard to say. I'm back to 50mg and I think I'll stick with that for a few weeks and see if I stabilise. I also have anastrozole that I might use in very small doses. If I stabilise I may try to up the dose a bit again (unless I find that that is the perfect amount for me). My problem is that I'm too impatient to wait for results. BTW If you remember to, please keep me posted on your progress. It sounds like we get similar side effects.</TEXT>

    <TEXT> gt;I did great when I started on TRT, but after about 7 weeks I felt myself backsliding and not feeling as good as I was before while on TRT. My doctor bumped my dose up +30mg per week and two days later I woke up early, wide awake as soon as I opened my eyes. I went downstairs and started feeling more and more energy which turned into anxiety and higher blood pressure throughout the day. I called my doctor who reassured me that it was temporary. It got bad enough that afternoon that I felt like having a drink which calmed me down a bit. A day later I woke up feeling like freakin superman! I wish I could feel that awesome every day for the rest of my life! Anyways, that only lasted for three days then I started feeling normal (just good) after that. Weeks later my hematocrit and hemoglobin started getting a little high and I gave blood which made me feel better. THen my dose was lowered a bit and I've felt fine since then. Thanks for your reply, it's reassuring to hear. I'm on the gel and was taking 2 packs right away and felt aweful. But one pack for the past few days and I've been feeling /better/ than with those 2. I do take .5mg anasrozole every 3/4 days or so though. I think I will stick to that until I feel "stable". After that I'll try slowly bumping the dose.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Well, it might work for you. What's bothering you about cyp? I tried clomid for a couple of weeks. Was fine at first, my testosterone levels went up a fair deal. Problem is so did cortisol and estradiol (way up). I guess it might have worked for me if I stuck it out, added an AI or whatever. But really the only reason to take clomid rather than testosterone I believe would be to preserve fertility. However you can also store semen at a sperm bank and/or try a "PCT" when you want to have children.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>What I'm posting here isn't backed by any research (that I know of). But as far as I know, there's no ester attached to the T in cream/gel. So it's possible your T levels would be lower during the night, which is when your body makes most of its own T, and so maybe there is less HPA shutdown than when you take an ester like enanthate, where you have super levels the first day that then gradually reduces (but is presumably high during the night as well). Also if you take, (taking gel for an example again), it will typically only place you at mid-range T levels with 1 pack. You'll need to go to max dose to get high levels. So again less suppression if you're at the low/beginner dose.</TEXT>

    <TEXT> gt;So so true. It's scary to think of how I would've continued to feel how I did had I not pursued treatment! That, plus just how overall awful I felt every day. I'm glad I caught it relatively early and didn't lose too many years feeling that way (I'm 27, got my CPAP in May). I finally got back into reading after years of thinking I wasn't really into it anymore - turns out it's a lot easier to read when you're not fighting to keep your eyelids open. Oh man, same here. Except I hven't been able to get used to the CPAP. Any type of mask hurts me somewhere it seems. I'm really going to try to push through now though.</TEXT>

    <TEXT> gt;Before getting treatment, yes absolutely. I would space out when other people were talking, fail to comprehend what they were saying, and have a hard time speaking and finding the right words. I find it has gotten better with treatment, my mind is overall a lot more clear. I can think things through quicker and focus on what's happening rather than the fog blocking it. It was the worst when I was at work, but since I've been working from home I haven't been able to see how much I have actually improved as I now only communicate via messaging or email. I've just started TRT as well. CPAP I haven't gotten used to yet but I'm trying. Pillows left sores inside my nose, full nasal mask left sores under my nose, and now full face mask on top of it. :)</TEXT>

    <TEXT>My problems so far have been trouble falling to sleep with the mask. I seem to have solved that with the ramping feature (I'm using CPAP). Then when I used the pillows mask I got sores inside my nose. Full nasal made me red under the nose, and the full face mask has made me swollen on top of the nose bridge in 2 days. Maybe I should just keep rotating between the different injuries. :)</TEXT>

    <DATE>2020-10-08 09:14:34</DATE>
    <TEXT>I want to hear is some of your stories on increasing testosterone. Here is mine (without much facts, just how I experienced and read it): I was taking 50mg testosterone gel and had levels at 24nmol/l or almost 700ng/dl. I increased to 100mg and slightly bumped anastrozole as well. Felt more tired, dry eyes, morning wood (that was present with 50mg and some anastrozole) was gone. I kept this up for 3 days, then dropped anastrozole for 2 days, then dropped to 75mg testosterone gel.Once the dry eyes were gone I added some anastrozole back in as my mood took a huge dip. This has helped my mood. I feel like low E2 for me causes dry eyes - but high E2 loses my erection quality and my mood becomes depressed/overly emotional. It's hard to say without blood tests I'm aware. Update: #160; After 3 consecutive days at 75mg with .25mg anastrozole/adex every day the morning wood is back. The mood seems better as well.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Super interesting. Did you use any AI with it? I did try arimidex/anastrozole once without testosterone and got extremely dry eyes straight away. But ofc. that raises test as well as lowers E2. Now when I raised test a lot and anastrozole a little I got the same.</TEXT>

    <TEXT> gt;It was like this for me for the first year I was on TRT and then it improved and now I sleep better than I have in decades. Also, your dosage of 200 mg is pretty high. Lowering your dosage would probably be your quickest way to improve things now. Did you ever get tested with sleep apnea? What's your dose at/what levels is that getting you to?</TEXT>
