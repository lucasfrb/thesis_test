    <TITLE>Socialists wanted to abolish the wage system, but every socialist country had wages. Even Cambodia, ruled by a guy who admitted he did not understand Marx, just replaced a currency with another.</TITLE>

Replacing green papers with circulating rice is not the same as abolishing any currency. And no, Marx #8217;s labor vouchers were never implemented anywhere :  gt; The producers may, for all it matters, receive paper vouchers entitling them to withdraw from the social supplies of consumer goods a quantity corresponding to their labour-time. These vouchers are not money. **They do not circulate.** -Capital So since socialism is the abolition of the wage system, and since the wage system has never been abolished anywhere, socialism has never existed. In my opinion, it simply cannot exist in our lifetime. None of us will live to see a worldwide society without any currency.</TEXT>

    <TEXT> gt; I have just been visited by the chief of the Jewish community here, who has asked me for a petition for the Jews to the Provincial Assembly, and I am willing to do it.  gt; However much I dislike the Jewish faith, Bruno Bauer #8217;s view seems to me too abstract. The thing is to make as many breaches as possible in the Christian state and to smuggle in as much as we can of what is rational.  gt; At least, it must be attempted  #8211; and the embitterment grows with every petition that is rejected with protestations. -[Karl Marx, letter to Arnold Ruge](https://marxists.catbull.com/archive/marx/works/1843/letters/43_03_13.htm)  gt; [Nothing equals the misery and the sufferings of the Jews at Jerusalem, inhabiting the most filthy quarter of the town, called hareth-el-yahoud, the quarter of dirt, between the Zion and the Moriah, where their synagogues are situated  #8211; the constant objects of oppression and intolerance, insulted by the Greeks, persecuted by the Latins, and living only upon the scanty alms transmitted by their European brethren.](https://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1854/03/28.htm) -Karl Marx, 1854  gt; [For anti-Semitism betokens a retarded culture, which is why it is found only in Prussia and Austria, and in Russia too.

    <TEXT>Still, as long as there is money, prices and enterprises, that #8217;s not socialism, that #8217;s capitalism. A different kind of capitalism than in the west, but still capitalism. Under socialism/communism there is no wage system. So the Eastern Bloc never achieved socialism.</TEXT>

    <TITLE>The necessary conditions for socialism</TITLE>
    <DATE>2020-10-19 02:51:56</DATE>
    <TEXT>Socialism demands a certain set of conditions of a material as well as a psychical order, a high development of capitalistic organisation, not only of production but also of the export and import of raw materials. Moreover, it also demands a proletariat, which is conscious of its duties, not only towards its own neighbours and comrades, but also towards society as a whole  #8211; a proletariat, moreover, which has become accustomed to voluntary discipline and self-administration through long years of mass organisation; and which, finally, is intelligent enough to distinguish the possible from the impossible, and the scientifically educated leader with character from an ignorant demi-god without a conscience. Wherever these conditions are not present, like in 1930 Eastern Europe, 1960 Asia or 2010 Latin America, capitalism cannot with any success be permanently dissolved by Socialism.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Yes, as you might have guessed, I #8217;m a big defender of communism ; in my post I #8217;m literally saying that we #8217;re going to see communism in our lifetime. All I #8217;m saying is : Marx #8217;s socialism never existed, and never will. By Marx #8217;s standards, the Eastern Bloc was capitalist. A dictatorship of the proletariat, maybe. But not socialism. And his non-circulating labor vouchers were never implemented anywhere.</TEXT>
