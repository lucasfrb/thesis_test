    <TITLE>Is it too late to become a competitive swimmer?</TITLE>
    <DATE>2020-05-27 09:41:21</DATE>
    <TEXT>I M(17) started swimming after an ACL tear last year and recently I realised that I like it alot and would like to take it to the next level. Will it be too late for me to start considering most competitive swimmers start from a really young age? If yes how do I become stronger and swim faster? Here are some of my swim timings 1500m-25.00 1000m-16.10 800m-12.55 500m-7.40</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I recently took over a leopard gecko from somebody who obviously couldn't care of it. It's growth was stunted and it had bad? mbd (joints all deformed). However I did not notice that it's tail was almost completely black and shrivelled up. I think it could be a tail necrosis but I'm unable to find a reptile vet or any vets in my area willing to treat a leopard gecko. Anything I could do to help it myself?</TEXT>
