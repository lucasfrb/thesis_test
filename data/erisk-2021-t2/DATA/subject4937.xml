    <TEXT>This sub is about volleyball or the actions performed in this sport. Posting a clip of a jump up the stairs doesn't help people to recognise the mistakes you might make during actual volleyball. To just find excersises helping you jump higher you could have used google. I didn't down nor upvote this but these are my assumptions.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Hi everybody I'm about to build my first "higher" end pc with everything included and i wanted to know your opinion about it. The pc will primarily be for gaming. I'm fine with spendding this much money for a good working system but if i can save some without loosing much performance that would still be great. I'm also looking for bottle necks to be fixed. Some things to consider: \- the graphics card is already ordered and will probably arrive in the next few years (thanks nvidia) \- i would like to have as much as possible in white, however where i live not everything is available  #8203; Here's the system: PCPartPicker Part List: [https://pcpartpicker.com/list/6dwbvf](https://pcpartpicker.com/list/6dwbvf)  #8203; CPU: AMD Ryzen 9 3900X 3.8 GHz 12-Core Processor ($429.99 @ Amazon) Motherboard: MSI MPG X570 GAMING PRO CARBON WIFI ATX AM4 Motherboard ($254.89 @ B amp;H) Memory: Corsair Vengeance RGB Pro 32 GB (2 x 16 GB) DDR4-3200 CL16 Memory ($129.99 @ Best Buy) Storage: Samsung 970 EVO Plus 2 TB M.2-2280 NVME Solid State Drive ($299.99 @ Amazon) Video Card: MSI GeForce RTX 3080 10 GB VENTUS 3X OC Video Card Case: Lian Li PC-O11 Dynamic ATX Full Tower Case ($124.99 @ Adorama) Power Supply: Corsair HX Platinum 1000 W 80+ Platinum Certified Fully Modular ATX Power Supply ($323.00 @ Amazon) Case Fan: Lian Li UNI SL120 58.54 CFM 120 mm Fans 3-Pack Case Fan: Lian Li UNI SL120 58.54 CFM 120 mm Fans 3-Pack Total: $1562.85 Prices include shipping, taxes, and discounts when available Generated by PCPartPicker 2020-10-14 16:50 EDT-0400  #8203; I'm not sure about the CPU cooler if you can give me some advise there that would be really nice.

If you have any other tipps that would also be really appreciated.</TEXT>
