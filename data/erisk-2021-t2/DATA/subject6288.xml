    <TITLE>On the war not being over (Spoilers everything)</TITLE>
    <DATE>2016-06-07 15:14:44</DATE>
    <TEXT>I watched yesterday the latest episode, and I found a nice little parallel between two notoriously stubborn men and highly regarded commanders. When Stannis went to the Iron Bank of Braavos to request funding for his campaign, Ser Davos said at one moment: "As long as Stannis lives, the war is not over". On the same vein, Brynden "the Blackfish" Tully responded to Jaime's comment on the war being over: "as long as I'm standing the war is not over". So, will the war ever be over?</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I have tried to find someone post a decently sized picture of Queen Cersei's crown, but to avail. I managed to get a picture that shows the crown in rather good detail, yet not as detailed as I would have liked, but here it goes. http://www.jotdown.es/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/9.jpg So, Michele Clapton did an amazing job, and we can get behind what she said. The crown reflects Cersei's loneliness at the top. Some silvery metal with just hints of gold. Let's get to it: First, the metals. A silvery metal with some gold. Steel or silver are way stronger than gold. The fact there is so little of the latter can remind us of the fact that the Lannisters are not as rich anymore as they were. Tywin told Cersei that the Lannisters mines were exhausted, and the crown reflects it. The circlet. It looks both elegant and menacing. A very well crafted chain or something like that. Ir serves to remember us that not only you hold power, but power holds you too. The frontal part. We get a nice combination that shows something we already knew. We can see an abstraction of a lion's head whose mane is shaped like the blades surging from the top of the Iron Throne. Since Tywin ran the Seven Kingdoms for the first time until now that Cersei is queen, the Lannisters have been the real power of Westeros. Lannisters were all over the place and the throne was actually theirs, even though nominally belonging to House Baratheon</TEXT>

    <TITLE>(Spoilers Extended) LittleFouch #233; and Vareyrand</TITLE>
    <DATE>2016-07-26 09:24:56</DATE>
    <TEXT>I recently came up with this idea that the two greatest players of the game of thrones (Littlefinger and Varys) had some remarkable elements taken from the two ruthless players of the most dangerous game in the most interesting times. Naturally, Varys and Littlefinger don't match up the historical characters to a T, but the connections are there and make everything a bit more intriguing. So, here we go. Charles Maurice de Talleyrand-P #233;rigord, insofar he will be referred to as "Talleyrand", was born to an aristocratic house of the most ancient nobility in France, the house of P #233;rigord. Talleyrand, as many noblemen of the time, joined the clergy, where rose the position of bishop, which granted him ecclesiastical immunity (to be honest, let's call it impunity). He served as an advisor for king Louis XVI of France, but, as things got more interesting, he was able to stay in the highest positions, serving as Minister of Foreign Affairs under the Revolution, Bonaparte, and the Restoration of the Bourbons. In my mind, he was a true patriot, noting that he always served the Realm. Even in the worst circumstances, he managed to negotiate from a power postion. In the Vienna Conference, he was the orchestrator of the Restoration and bringing back a deposed dynasty and the absolutism. Some of his quotes are pure gold and worthy of Varys: "To succeed in the world, it is much more necessary to possess the penetration to discern who is a fool, than to discover who is a clever man." "The art of statesmanship is to foresee the inevitable and to expedite its occurrence" Since the masses are always eager to believe something, for their benefit nothing is so easy to arrange as facts." ("Power resides were men believe it resides", Varys would say) "The reputation of a man is like his shadow, gigantic when it precedes him, and pigmy in its proportions when it follows" ("Even a very small man can cast a very large shadow", Varys) "Kings and regimes come and go. I remain" ("I keep on paddling", as per Varys). Fouch #233;, on the other hand, was born a commoner, but through his own mediums, wits, and ruthlessness, rose through the ranks and became Minister of Police, commanding a network of spies that terrified the kingdom of France (or Republic of France, or French Empire), yet nobody knew how it worked exactly. Fouch #233; was instrumental in the fall of Robespierre and the Terror. He was hated and feared, yet he was not sacked, as he was absurdly competent as a spymaster. When Fouch #233; and Talleyrand joined forces, they were able to help more than a bit in making Napoleon Bonaparte fail and fall. Fouch #233; and Talleyrand's rivalry was fierce, but they both enjoyed it, as the lack of one of the players would make the Grand Game really boring. In the end, Talleyrand won, but found another wothy opponent: Metternich. T.L; D.R: Varys and Littlefinger take a lot of elements from Fouch #233; and Talleyrand.</TEXT>

    <TITLE>How are voting systems and vote counts in your countries?</TITLE>
    <DATE>2017-12-12 16:58:12</DATE>
    <TEXT>Some conspiracy theories have been surfacing in recent days in Catalonia, claiming that on the elections taking place on December 21st there will be electoral fraud coming from the Government. The proponents of this theory claim that Indra will be counting the votes, and that is how fraud will occur. Although it is true that Indra has previously paid millions in bribes to the Popular Party in order to secure public contracts, the voting fraud allegations are preposterous. Indra will set up the IT infrastructure for giving out the provisional results, setting up datacenters and a web page to publish the provisional results. However, the official results are not based on this. They are based on the vote counts done in the courthouses by the Local, Provincial, and Central Eleectoral Commissions. These commissions make their counts based on the official bills emmitted by every electoral table (signed by the members of the table after having counted everything under the scrutiny of parties' representatives and any citizen wanting to witness it). So, my question. How are votes counted in your countries?</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Juan Ju #225;rez de Gallinato was a Spanish commander that invaded Cambodia with some 2,000 Spanish and Portuguese soldiers and a hundred Jesuits in the late XVI century, turning Cambodia into a puppet state.

We know of their exploits thanks to the letters written to the governor of the Philippines and the letters to the Council of the Indies by the Governor and Antonio de Morga.

    <TEXT>The loser Unai Emery promoted Lorca to Segunda Divisi #243;n. The loser Unai Emery promoted Almer #237;a to Primera, turning it a year later into the second best newly promoted team in the history of the league. The loser Unai Emery made a routine of what is now considered a landmark, id est having Valencia qualify for the Champions League. On that way, the board sold Silva, Mata, Villa... nobodies. The loser Unai Emery won three Europa Leagues with Sevilla. Not one or two: three. In a row. The loser Unai Emery has conquered seven trophies in two seasons with PSG. Those trophies that, apparently, they can win by themselves, but it turns out he has won them. The loser Unai Emery faced Barcelona and Real Madrid in the Champions League, playoffs where he was not that far from eliminating them. It is curious that, regarding the first one, the refereeing is still remembered... but let that not be an excuse for the coach. The loser Unai Emery is now joining Arsenal, a club that, it is known, has no respect for the coach's role. Passarella defined journalism as "the undefeated", for we never lose. The losers are always the others. Like Unai Emery, for example. Edit: a couple of typos. Addendum: original article by Alberto R. Barbero, on Marca's last page of today's newspaper.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>There was a bit of both phenomena: I have seen "hir", "hera", and many other examples of "h" where there should be none, which speaks of an irregular orthography, because there was no suchh a thing as a normative. The normative Spanish as we know it today was not a thing until the 1850s, though by the middle of the XVIII century there was a fair share of standardisation. In the XVI and XVII century, Spanish language evolved a lot, most notably the readjustament of the sybillants, with the appearance of the Z and J that we know today, and the disappearance of the pronunciation of the X (equivalent to the English "sh") and the Z or  #199; ("ds", approximately). Similarly, the H evolved too, going completely silent, resulting today in differing lectures for something that would be roughly similar in the Golden Age (fervor / hervor being a notorious case). Any toponym you find with "hont" is because it evolved from "font", for example. We know a lot about historical grammar thanks to early dictionaries and grammars, books on rhetorics, and even the most ordinary of documents. Thanks to the literature and documentation we know the extension of the seseo and ceceo. Andr #233;s de Claramonte, from Murcia, rhymes with seseo (rhyming "diez" and "pies" for example). As for the odd "s", I think you mean the "high s". It was an aesthetic choice from the printers, particularly favoured when a double s was required, or to make a more harmonious looking word when some pairs of letters are present together (st, sl, si, most notably).</TEXT>

    <TEXT>In the end, it doesn't really matter as long as the message is understood. However, the names are a confusing thing of their own. The first name given by Europeans to the island is "la Espa #241;ola", as accredited by Columbus' letter to Luis de Sant #225;ngel, which I quote and translate. *Del qual cabo av #237;a otra ysla al oriente, distante d #233;sta dies e ocho leguas, a la qual puse luego nombre Espa #241;ola y fui all #237; y segu #237; la parte del setentri #243;n, asy como de la Juana, al oriente  #231;iento e setenta y ocho grandes leguas por linia rrecta del oriente* **Translation:** From which cape there was another island towards the Oriente, eighteen leagues away, which I immediately named Espa #241;ola, and went there, and continued on its septentrional side, as well as that of Juana towards the Orient for one hundred and seventy eight leagues on a straight line towards the Orient. Santo Domingo is a denomination that appeared rather early, in the first decades of the XVI century, as a case of metonymy, the whole being named for the part. The same happened to Puerto Rico and San Juan, which were switched. The island of Puerto Rico was named San Juan, and the main city was Puerto Rico. Eventually, people started calling the island Puerto Rico, the same as with Santo Domingo. Gonzalo Fern #225;ndez de Oviedo, who was governor of Santo Domingo, uses both La Espa #241;ola and Santo Domingo in his works. When talking about Francisco de Garay, for example, he says the following: *Antes desto, Francisco de Garay, por su industria e granjer #237;as, fu #233; en esta isla de Sancto Domingo rico hombre e muy aprovechado, e mucho m #225;s lo fu #233; despu #233;s con esta compa #241; #237;a que tuvo en las haciendas reales, de que result #243; que estando muy pr #243;spero destos bienes que quita y da la fortuna...* *Translation*: Before this, Francisco de Garay, due to his industry and farming, was in this island of Santo Domingo a rich man, and of profit, and much more he was with the company he had in the royal estates, being very prosperous on these goods that Fortune gives and takes... The name Haiti is the name the natives had for the island of Hispaniola or Santo Domingo, a fact attested, again, by Fern #225;ndez de Oviedo. I shall give some quotations on the matter: *De las salinas naturales y artificiales que ten #237;an los indios en esta isla Espa #241;ola, llamada Hait #237;, antes que los cristianos conquistasen estas partes, y de las que hay al presente.* **Translation**: Of the natural salt pans that the indias had in this island of Hispaniola, named Haiti, before the christians had conquered these parts, and what pans nowadays remain *Pues conviene para conclusi #243;n de la primera parte desta General Historia de Indias, dar particular raz #243;n de las otras islas, pues he recontado lo que he podido ver y entender de la principal dellas, llamada por los indios Hait #237; e por los cristianos Espa #241;ola...* **Translation**: For it is convenient to conclude the first part of this General History of the Indies, giving particular report of the other islands, as I have told what I have been able to see and to understand of the main of those, called Haiti by the Indians and Hispaniola by the christians... A syntagm that appears more than dozen times in Oviedo is "Haiti, que agora llamamos espa #241;ola" (Haiti, that we now call Hispaniola), or any variation thereof. Haiti is not only attested in Oviedo, of course, but in many other chroniclers and travellers, who all insist that this was the name the island had prior to it being baptised as Hispaniola. Quisqueya is a much less frequent denomination, but Spanish chronicler Francisco L #243;pez de G #243;mara, when speaking about Hispaniola, mentions Quisqueia along with Haiti as names for the island. I quote him on this: *EL SITIO DE LA YSLA ESPA #209;OLA Y OTRAS PARTICULARIDADES.* *En lengua de los naturales de aquella ysla se dize Hait #237; y Quisqueia. Hait #237; quiere dezir aspereza, y Quisqueia, tierra grande. Christ #243;val Col #243;n la nombr #243; Espa #241;ola; agora la llaman muchos Santo Domingo, por la ciudad m #225;s principal que ay en ella* **Translation**: The place of the Hispaniola island, and other particularities. In the language of the natives of that island it is called Haiti and Quisqueia. Haiti means roughness, and Quisqueia big land. Christopher Columbus named it Hispaniola; now many call it Santo Domingo, for the most principal city there is in it. In conclusion, all three denominations are correct and apply to the same island. Use them at will.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Coru #241;a is wrong. Prior to 1208, the village was named Faro (lighthouse) for more than evident reasons. In 1208, King Alfonso IX of Le #243;n decided to repopulate the peninsula of Coru #241;a, and also establish there a solid settlement, that's why he granted the village of faro the "fuero" of Benavente, id est a royal charter with freedoms, exemptions, etc. The name Crunia only exists in fiction up to that date, to be exact it is from the Historia Turpini. It has nothing to do with Corona.

    <TEXT>That's quite a number of questions, but I'll try to answer them all as best as I can. First and foremost we need to know who these people were, and for that we go to Andalusia to the late stages of the n-th Castilian civil war, the one between Isabel and Juana. In that war, Juana's faction was supported by Portugal, as Juana was married to the King of Portugal. Our neighbours from the other side of the Mi #241;o had a remarkably strong navy, nearly on par with the Castilian one, and they could receive supplies from Guinea, mostly gold to finance the campaign.Given those circumstances, Alonso de Quintanilla, contador mayor de cuentas (literally chief accounting officer, but think of him as some sort of finance minister with powers of war minister) opted for a privateering approach: he would enlist the help of the sailors from the Atlantic coast of Andalusia, as far extending them an unofficial "patente de corso universal" (universal letter of marque) so these fellows would prey on every Portuguese ship coming from Guinea, and in that regard they were succesful. There are registered attacks by sailors from Palos (for the period 1475-1480) to Portuguese ships in the Canary Islands, the cape of Aguer, the cape Saint Vincent, and even as far as the Azores. They also occasionally preyed on English ships, and if need be on any ships, like Vicente Pinz #243;n did in 1477 and along with his brother Mart #237;n in 1480. We are talking here of very seasoned veterans in the art of navigation, and the art of piracy as wel, not people prone to believe in any bullshit a foreigner would peddle. When Columbus set up his banner for people to enlist in his expedition, he failed miserably. The people of Palos, Moguer, Huelva, Puerto de Santa Mar #237;a, did not trust this foreigner of whose experience they knew nothing. Columbus, though, managed to convince some of the natural leaders of the zone: the Pinz #243;n brothers. Mart #237;n Alonso, Vicente Y #225; #241;ez, and Francisco Mart #237;n were a trio of brothers from Palos, respected as merchants, rich men, and more than capable sailors: Mart #237;n was 50 years old and in good health, meaning his ships were safe and sound and his abilities were more than good, as by 50 he had not died at sea. Francisco Mart #237;n Pinz #243;n was some 40 years old and a very experienced merchant and sailor too. Vicente was young, 30 years old, but the man was already a legend amongst his fellows: by age 15 he commanded his own vessel and had pillaged several places in Catalonia, including the port of Barcelona. But these three brothers took some convincing, in fact Mart #237;n was rather reluctant. However, after long explanations and consultations with friar Juan P #233;rez, a scholarly friar from La R #225;bida, and Antonio de Marchena, a consummate astronomer of the same monastery, Mart #237;n and his brothers were convinced that the expedition could be fruitful. Besides the two friars, Columbus had talked in previous times with a captain from Palos, a certain Pedro V #225;zquez, who had been under the employ of the King of Portugal in the 1450s, and had reached the island of Flores, which is farther away than the Azores. This man was sure there should have been land farther away in the Ocean, and had spread these ideas in Palos, but to little avail. He had been a friend to the Pinz #243;n brothers, to the Ni #241;o brothers, and particularly to Antonio de Marchena. So, it was not Columbus who convinced the sailors to join his expedition. That job was done by the natural leaders of the region, not being it a simple task. This still begs the question as to how did these people convince some 120 men to join a most uncertain journey. The answer is not clear in any way, and the Columbian Lawsuits don't shed a lot of light on the matter, but there are reasonable explanations: Columbus, and the rest of his gang, had promised wealth. Christopher Columbus' idea was to go to the Indies, more precisely to isles of Spices. He had also promised, according to his knowledge from Marco Polo, Pierre d'Ailly, and Pius II, that there were massive deposits of gold, gems, silver, the whole lot. This was much uncertain, but the spices were a clear way of getting wealthy, and to establish a direct route to the Spice Islands would be profitable in and of itself. If the route was correct, it would have also been completely safe, as the seafarers would completely avoid the Portuguese ships that were along the coast of Africa, and in the Indian Ocean. About the other question, I guess you mean to know if after making it back to Europe they went to America again. Of the 120 sailors that had sailed from Palos, some 30 died in America. In late 1492, Columbus set a fort, Fuerte Natividad, in the island of Santo Domingo, and left his brother-in-law Diego de Arana in command of it, along with 30 other Spaniards. They all died, most likely killed and eaten by the tainos. Of the people who made it back, some were fairly ordinary people, going back to their businesses in Palos, Moguer, etc. The officers are much better documented: Vicente Y #225; #241;ez Pinz #243;n went back to America more than once: in the last days of 1499 he departed from Palos, alongside other people, and in the early days of 1500 he discovered Brazil, and the Amazon river. In 1508 he went to America again, accompanied by Juan D #237;az de Sol #237;s, navigating the Caribbean and discovering the coast of Mexico from the Northwest of Yucat #225;n to 23 #186; 30' N, which is around modern-day Tampico. Other people who went more than once to America having been in the first Columbian journey were Juan de la Cosa (owner of the Santa Mar #237;a), Diego de Lepe, Alonso de Ojeda, and other sailors. Did any of the people that had joined the first journey become rich? Absolutely not. They were all shafted by Columbus, who had secured special privileges for himself, leaving the other people just about empty-handed. **Sources** Bache Gould, Alicia (1984), *Nueva lista documentada de los tripulantes de Col #243;n en 1492*.

    <TEXT>Eso de "Suevia" se basa en la presunta bandera del reino suevo de Gallaecia, que por supuesto es mentira.  #191;De d #243;nde sale esa bandera? La primera vez que aparece mencionada una bandera con el le #243;n y el drag #243;n afrontados, en fondo amarillo, es en un informe del cabildo de la catedrql de Lugo, en el a #241;o 1669, que se remite a la Junta del Reino de Galicia para que estudie la posibilidad de adoptar otra bandera para Galicia. En este informe no se da ninguna fuente que acredite el origen de la bandera, mas all #225; de gen #233;ricos t #233;rminos como "antiguas cr #243;nicas" o "nuestra investigaci #243;n". Sin embargo, se puede tirar del hilo un poco m #225;s. Hay un blas #243;n en nuestra vecina Portugal que presenta tambi #233;n un drag #243;n y un le #243;n afrontados: el escudo de Co #237;mbra. Ese escudo, seg #250;n se dice, representa el pacto que uni #243; al rey de los suevos con el de los alanos en Co #237;mbra, mediante la uni #243;n del rey suevo Hermerico (o Rekhila) con la hija del rey alano (Cindazunda). Este origen del escudo es moderno y ap #243;crifo, es un escudo que aparece en  #233;poca del rey Manuel I (siglo XVI) el Afortunado, siendo que antes el escudo s #243;lo mostraba un c #225;liz con una mujer saliendo de  #233;l.  #191;De d #243;nde pudo salir la ocurrencia? De que el cronista Bernardo de Brito, que es el primero en explicar el escudo, o #237;a campanas y mo sab #237;a muy bien d #243;nde. Los suevos fueron un pueblo federado a Roma, hab #237;an acordado un foedus con el Imperio, de tal manera que los suevos eran semiindependientes de Roma, pero deb #237;an asistirla militarmente cuando fuese necesario. Estamos hablando del siglo V, cuando el  #225;guila ha ca #237;do en desuso entre el ej #233;rcito romano. En esa  #233;poca las unidades militares romanas no llevan  #225;guilas sino dragones, o as #237; es como llaman a los estandartes con forma de cabeza de gran reptil que usan.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Do municipalities in Italy normally correspond to one population core or there are normally several population cores under one municipality? Galicia is a bit of an oddity, as each municipality contains normally several different cores, called "lugares" (places) or parroquias (parishes). The parishes don't necessarily match ecclesiastical parishes, though. To give you an idea of how disperse the population of Galicia is, half the population cores of Spain are in Galicia. This dispersion may explain the relatively low coronavirus impact in Galicia (550 dead, population 2,75 million).</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Last year, or a couple of years ago, there was a substantial genetic study in Andalusia (South of Spain) to try verify the claim the Andalusians have more Berber blood than the rest of Spain. Not surprisingly for us historians, they don't. Let me explain. The Berbers, Arabs, and Syrians that invaded the Iberian Peninsula in 711 only numbered some 40,000 people, nearly all being Berbers. When they conquered just about all of the Peninsula, they did not intermarry a lot with the local populations, becoming some sort of aristocratic caste. A bit the same applies to the Goths that had invaded the Peninsula three centuries prior. So, the genetic legacy of Al Andalus is nearly non-existent, but the cultural legacy is immense.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Amerigo Vespucci did not name those lands. The name America first appeared in[Martin Waldseem #252;ller's map](https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Universalis_cosmographia_secundum_Ptholomaei_traditionem_et_Americi_Vespucii_alioru(m)que_lustrationes._LOC_2003626426.jpg) of 1507, which was the first printed map that contained the lands of the New World. This begs the question on why did Waldseem #252;ller name those lands as such. The cartographic information on the Indies was relatively scarce up to that moment. The only detailed maps were possessed by the Casa de la Contrataci #243;n de las Indias in Seville, and in the Royal Court of Portugal in Lisbon. The Casa de la Contrataci #243;n kept the most accurate maps possible, and recceived information every year from the expeditions sponsored by the Crown and the Casa, updating the Padr #243;n Real (Royal Census, id est the general map of the New World) with every new information. This updating was the duty of the Piloto Mayor, the chief cartographic officer of the Casa de la Contrataci #243;n. In 1506, the Piloto Mayor was none other than Amerigo Vespucci, who obtained the post under recommendation of Christopher Columbus' himself, who always cared about Amerigo for they both were foreigners, Italians specifically. Amongst the duties of the Piloto Mayor was to keep the information as state secret, as the information on the new lands was of vital importance to the Crown. Not quite exactly fulfilling his duties, Amerigo Vespucci sent some cartographic information to the German cartographer Martin Waldseem #252;ller, who had requested some info from the Casa in order to create a world map. The maps sent by Amerigo to Martin were not the most recent or most updated maps he had, of course. If you carefully analyse Waldseem #252;ller's map you can spot some interesting details like the shape of Cuba, that closely matches the one depicted in [Caverio's map](https://gallica.bnf.fr/ark:/12148/btv1b7759102x), which is a copy of [the anonymous map of Alberto Cantino from 1502](https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Cantino_planisphere_(1502).jpg). The coastline close to Cuba that goes on a South-North axis is not Florida as you could deduce from the shape, but it's the northern coast of the Yucat #225;n peninsula. This also comes from a map related to the Cantino and Caverio maps, as evident from analysis. Even if the information was not the best, or the most up to date, Waldseem #252;ller thanked Amerigo Vespucci by placing his name on the New World, and even depicting him alongside Ptolemy on the upper part of the map. Waldseem #252;ller would change his mind in 1513, when he made his Universalis Cosmographia, not having the name of America on it anymore, but it was late, the name had already caught on despite the Indies denomination being more frequent. As for the -ia suffix, it is the common suffix for place names in Latin, which was the universal language of culture until the XVIII century. Think of some Latin place names and you'll come to that realisation: Hispania, Gallia, Lusitania, Italia, Britannia, Graecia, Dacia, Germania, Rhaetia, Moestia, etc.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>There is no explicit confirmation, but that'd the theory I go with, though I may be wrong. I go with it based on the cartographic evidence that always ends up leading to the Casa de la Contrataci #243;n. The Cantino map, according to Varela Marcos, is based on a copy of the Juan de la Cosa map that also incorporates some elements from the Kunstmann IV (showing the expedition of Alonso V #233;lez de Mendoza). One has to also take into account the toponymy on Waldseem #252;ller's map, thst doesn't necessarily match Vespucci's tales, but contains elements picked up from cartography.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Spain played a major role in the US War of Independence, most notably there were two generals who distinguished themselves during that war: Bernardo de G #225;lvez (made and honorary citizen by Washington, but the motion was forgot and only passed into law in 2014) and Luis de C #243;rdova. Bernardo de G #225;lvez, first Count of G #225;lvez and first viscount of Galveston, organised a succesful campaign that recovered Mobile, Pensacola, the coast of Florida, and took control of the Bahama channel acting from his base in Louisiana, of which he was governor. He also granted refuge in Spanish ports to American ships that needed it, and allowed American ships to trade from there. G #225;lvez also suffocated a rebellion in Natchez, and blockaded New Orleans so that the English ships could not go up the Mississippi to organise a flanking manoeuvre against the American forces. His campaigns secured a Spanish control of the Gulf of Mexico, Florida, and the Bahamas, that made it impossible for the British to reinforce their troops. G #225;lvez was thanked for his service, made an honorary citizen of the United States, and it was approved to have his portrait in the American Congress. This last part was entirely forgotten until someone realised in 2013, and G #225;lvez's portrait was eventually hung in 2014. His honorary citizenship was also legally approved by Congress that year. The old admiral Luis de C #243;rdova y C #243;rdova dealt an enormous blow against the British with his action of September the 9th 1780. In that action, C #243;rdova captured a British double convoy with supplies for the troops that were fighting against the American rebels. The supplies captured amounted to 294 cannons, 80,000 muskets, 3,000 barrels of gunpowder, clothes and equipment for 12 regiments, one million pounds in cash, and 2,934 prisoners. This capture made the war virtually unwinnable for the British, cause the bankruptcy of many insurance companies, and deeply affected the London Stock. Besides these two generals and their military actions, Spain contributed economically to the American independence cause, though in smaller numbers than France. Beaumarchais and Floridablanca had set up a shell company called Roderigue Hortalez et Compagnie in order to provide money and supplies to the rebels, which were of vital importance in 1776. These are rather broad strokes on the Spanish participation in the War of American Independence, but there is much bibliography available, at least in Spanish.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>From the late Middle Ages we have many examples of jokes thanks to Poggio Bracciolini, who compiled a book of them, known as *Liber facetiarum*, id est Book of funny stories. The jokes therein comprised are really good, although some were funnier in context. I'll translate for you my favourite one, to give you a taste of misser Bracciolini. *One of our fellow nationals, a not so bright one, and inexperienced in the matters of love, got married. One night in bed, his wife turned her back on him, who was stunned at the gesture. So stunned he was, that he asked his wife if she had two of those things, and having her said that she did, he answered: "Oh, oh, one is enough for me, the other is too much". Then, the woman, wittily, as her priest was also her lover, said: "we can give the other in alm to the Church, and to our priest, for he'll have great pleasure with it, and you shall not be offended, as one is enough for you". The man agreed, in order to take that weight off his shoulders, and to please the priest, who he liked. And so, having invited him to dinner and told him the case, the three went to bed, the husband on the front, and the priest on the rear so he enjoyed the gift. The priest, hungry for that desired prize, attacked first; seeing that the woman was making some noises, the husband feared the priest would get into his territory: "Oi, friend, stick to your side and leave mine alone". "God help me", said the priest, "I don't care much about yours as long as I can enjoy the Church's goods". With these words the idiot got calm, and invited the priest to freely enjoy his wife on the part she had given to the church".* There are a whole lot of very dirty jokes. I don't know whether there is an English translation of Poggio's facetiae, as I read them in Italian from this edition: Bracciolini, Poggio (1912). *Facezie di Poggio Fiorentino*, *introduzione di D. Ci #224;mpoli*. Lanciano: Carabba. Those are not the only surviving jokes from the Middle Ages, there are hundreds more, like the ones present in the Libro de Chistes, by Luis de Pinedo, or the early moder "Cancionero de obras de burlas movientes a risa (Valencia, 1519). The famous Galician-Portuguese cantigas do contain some raunchy or saucy poems (*Quatro caralhos* being my own favourite), and they are not alone in that regard.</TEXT>

In more modern words it would be something like this: There is this idiot who got married. When his wife turned his back towards him, he asked her "so, you have two things down there?". She said yes, and the man replied "one is enough for me". The wife, who was also the priest's mistress, said: "as one is good for you, let's give the other one to the Church as an act of charity". The husband agreed, invited the priest for dinner and explained the situation. The three went to bed, and the woman started to enjoying the priest all too much, so that the husband had to tell the priest to stick to his part. The priest told the man not to worry, he would only enjoy the Church's goods.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>It is not replaced with "f". This is a problem that we have to face when dealing with OCR, as it will inevitably recognise the high s as an f. The "s" was written in two different ways in the olden days: the high s that can be mistaken for an f, and the low s, which is the s that we know today. This can be seen both in manuscripts and print books. Even today, in the Latin alphabet, there is one language that incorporates this two different esses: German. It has the letter  #223; , which is the union of the high s and the regular s.

    <TEXT>And there are many more instances of named animals. In the Cycle of Troy we have Argos, which was the dog of the famous Odysseus. In the classical Antiquity there also examples of named animals that have come to be known to us: Bucephalus, Alexnader the Great's horse; Peritas, Alexander's dog; Incitatus, the horse of the infamous Caligula, etc. From the Middle Ages, probably the most famous horse is Babieca, El Cid's horse. The Spanish conquistadors also named their animals: Juan Ponce de Le #243;n was the owner of a very famous hound called Becerrillo. This Becerrillo was the father of Vasco N #250; #241;ez de Balboa's hound, the equally notorious Leoncico.

"This land is exceedingly hot and full of large snakes". That is not Antactica but Brazil. In fact, it is easy to deduce that when you take into account the info Piri Reis had. For South America he must have used a map closely related to the Juan de la Cosa map of 1500.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Ommitting the Portugal augmentation of honour, the coat of arms of the Gamas is exactly the same as the one used by the Ulloas, a prominent lineage of Galicia (the Spanish region North of Portugal). As far as I know, they are not related, but cannot swear it. In the [Nobili #225;rio de fam #237;lias de Portugal](http://purl.pt/12151/4/) one can see that the genearch of the Gamas is a certain Alvaro Annes (or alternatively Eanes), who took part in the battle of the river Salado. The "da Gama" appears in the next generation, with his son Joao Alz da Gama. Eanes (or Annes, or Y #225; #241;ez) was a very common occurrence amongst the Ulloa lineage of Galicia, like doctor Pero Y #225; #241;ez de Ulloa (or Pedro Eanes), couselor to king John I of Castile.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>In Spain, the concept of witchcraft died out in 1614. Some years prior there had been the trial of the witches of Zugarramurdi, where a bunch of "witches" had been sentenced to death and executed. One of the judges who took part in the trial, though he had joined late, revised the procedure, and submitted it to the Supreme Council of the Inquisition, with allegations of judicial malpractice and procedural errors. The Supreme Council revised the procedure in extenso and agreed with Alonso de Salazar's conclusions. The statement issued by the Supreme Council explicitly said that witchcraft did not exist but that the alleged witchcraft was nothing else but collective and/or individual hysteria, as well as neighbours denouncing neighbours in bad faith. The families of the witches of Zugarramurdi were restored in their rights and honour, and the sambenitos taken out. This was the end of witchcraft persecutions in Spain, that had taken the lives of more than 50 people up to that moment. Alonso de Salazar Fr #237;as would go down in History as "the witches' defendant".</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I don't know how you got that idea of it being humiliating judging from the text. The squire is actively looking for lords or knights to serve, although he comments something about serving ecclesiastical lords as not being a very good job for they are not that affluent. The thing he actually finds humiliating is serving certain lords that will eventually turn you into a servant for everything ("que os hab #233;is de convertir en malilla"). Being a squire to a higher up would be one of the jobs for the lowliest of the hidalgos, and that would be a stretch in the case of the squire protagonist of the third chapter. If you read carefully, you'll notice that he doesn't give away where he is from, he just uses very vague terms: " were not the houses there, but where I was born, sixteen leagues from there, in the Costanilla of Valladolid". This one, in the original phrasing, is even more ambiguous as one cannot really tell whether he was born in the Costanilla of Valladolid, or 16 leagues from there. The Costanilla was a rather well known street in Valladolid (today, Bajada de la Libertad), where a lot of jews and conversos lived, so the squire's hidalgu #237;a may beentirely ficticious. That would be further supported by the ways of greeting that the squire had (besoos las manos and other stupidities). That specific part of the Lazarillo de Tormes is a paraphrasis of fray Antonio de Guevara's letter to Alonso de Mendoza, Bishop of Palencia, in which Guevara strongly condemns all of those greetings, especially "besoos las manos", as improper of a good courtier or a good christian. So, the squire is out of a job, but trying to get one, while still trying to keep up the pretense of his hidalgu #237;a. Manual labour would be beneath an hidalgo, and there would also be certain jobs that required a rather long apprenticeship (carpenters, typesetters, metallurgists, bookbinders, butchers), which would exclude him from getting them. A classic way for hidalgos to rise on the social hierarchy would be to become jurists, getting employed by a court, the Inquisition (our squire is not getting this one either as they performed background checks), or be lawyers. This would, of course, require to go to university. If the squire didn't, it may be because he couldn't read, or because he did not know Latin, a language necessary for jurists. So, the poor squire did not have much of a choice if he wanted to keep up the pretense of his hidalgu #237;a while still trying to find someone to serve</TEXT>

    <TEXT>It is hard to tell, for lack of evident milestones, but by the early IX century the distinction was clear, as it can be inferred from Canon XVII of the III Council of Tours (AD 813), where it says: *Et ut easdem homilias quisque aperte transferre studeat in rusticam Romanam linguam, aut Theotiscam, quo facilius cuncti possint intelligere quae dicuntur* Latin, be it understood as high Latin or courtly Latin was, and still is the language of the Church, but the paragraph speaks of "rustic roman language" and also of "Germanic language" (I don't quite know how to translate "theotisca" to English, as in Spanish it would be "tudesca", which would be clearly understood as an archaism for German). This "rustic Roman", early Romance, was already far enough apart from Latin as making Latin not understandable to the listener, hence the necessity for the homilies to be preached in "vulgar romance". It is not the only case of the "Roman language" present in the IX century, as we have the oaths of Strasburg (AD 842), complete with a text in said "roman language". This Roman language is sufficiently distinct from Latin, but still archaic, as to be easily identified as a separate languge. *Cumque Karolus haec eadem verba romana lingua perorasset, Lodhuvicus, quoniam maior natu erat, prior haec deinde se servaturum testatus est* **Translation**: As Charles had spoken these words in Roman language, Louis, being the elder, was the first to swear to observe them. And now come those words, as they were spoken: *Pro Deo amur et pro christian poblo et nostro commun salvament, dist di in avant, in quant Deus savir et podir me dunat, si salvaraeio cist meon fradre Karlo, et in adiudha et in cadhuna cosa, si cum om per dreit son fradra salvar dist, in o quid il mi altresi fazet #160;; et ab Ludher nul plaid numquam prindrai, qui meon vol, cist meon fradre Karle in damno sit* One can easily see the many differences from Latin: "poblo" from "populo", "christian" instead of "christiano", "meon fradre" instead of "meum fratrum", "fazet" instead of "faciat", infinitives ending in "-r" and not in "-re", and many more. This text is so far apart from Latin, that it would be very hard to understand to someone who knew Latin. Half a century earlier, approximately, we have the Reichenau glosses, which is a huge corpus of side annotations to the Latin Bible. Those notes show a clear differentiation between the Latin of the text and what would later appear to be called "romana lingua", which would have known as "sermo rusticus" or "sermo vulgaris" prior to that. Those Reichenau glosses are there to help the priests better understand the contents of the Bible. If we go back in time, in the early VII century (between 600 and 620 AD), we have Saint Isidore of Seville, who writes in Book IX of his Etymologies the following: ***Some say there are four varieties of Latin, that is, Ancient (Priscus), Latin, Roman, and Mixed.*** *The Ancient is that uncouth language that the oldest people of Italy spoke in the age of Janus and Saturn, and it is preserved in the songs of the Salii. Then Latin, which the Etruscans and others in Latium spoke in the age of Latinus and the kings, and in this variety the Twelve Tables were written. Then Roman, which arose after the kings were driven out by the Roman people. In this variety the poets Naevius, Plautus, and Vergil, and the orators Gracchus and Cato and Cicero, and others produced their work.* ***Then Mixed, which emerged in the Roman state after the wide expansion of the Empire, along with new customs and peoples, corrupted the integrity of speech with solecisms and barbarisms*** So, in the early VII century we can gather that the language normally spoken was considered a variety of Latin, though highly corrupted, meaning that at least by the year 600 the different local varieties of Latin were not considered to be separate languages, but still Latin.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>First things first: people in Italy did not start speaking what we know today as Italian until the XX century. As the Italian philosopher Luciano de Crescenzo puts it "Italian is not the language of Dante, but the language of Pippo Baudo". Until the expansion of the radio, and more particularly of television, people nostly spoke their regional dialects or languages (Tuscan, Lombard, Venetian, Neapolitan, Ligur, etc), and these dialects are still rather widely spoken, although they are more prevalent amongst the elder folks. Having said that, the gist of your question concerns the emergence of Romance languages as separate entities from Latin. That can be traced more or less to the 600-800 AD period, as attested by some documents like the canons of the Council of Tours (AD 813). For this, I link you to an answer I gave yesterday concerning the emergence of Romance languages, which based on the Council of Tours, the Oaths of Strasburg (AD 842), the glosses of Reichenau (late VIII century), and Saint Isidore of Seville (early VII century).

    <TEXT>His crew was very close to an actual mutiny on October 10th 1492, as can be gathered from Columbus' own writings, and from Gonzalo Fern #225;ndez de Oviedo, who became a good friend of Columbus' sons and of Vicente Y #225; #241;ez Pinz #243;n (one of the captains of the expedition). If we only consider the annotation from Columbus' log on October 10th, the situation did not look so dire. I quote: *Here the people could not bear it anymore, they complained about the long voyage. But the Admiral humoured them as best as he could, giving them good hope of the profits they could have. And he added that complaining was out of place, for he had come to the Indies, and so would he continue until finding them with the help of Our Lord.* This only indicates that morale was very low, but not that people were close to a mutiny. We need to go to February the 14th 1493 to get a solid grip on how dire the situation was: *For God had saved him in the journey* \[to the Indies\], *when he had more reasons to fear the sufferings he had with the sailors and people he carried, all of who with one voice were determined on turning against him and rebelling, raising their protests, and the Eternal God gave him courage against them, and many more things of great wonder that God had shown on that first voyage* Those protests are much more detailed in Gonzalo Fern #225;ndez de Oviedo's General and Natural History of the Indies, book II, chapter V. Oviedo, having met Vicente Pinz #243;n, and many more people that had gone to the Indies on the first journey, gather as many testimonies as he could, and those were relatively close in time as to have vivid memories. Let us not forget that Vicente Pinz #243;n died in 1514, so Oviedo must have met him somewhere between 1505-1508, some 12-15 years apart from the voyage, which was something memorable. I quote Oviedo: *Those that were with him started to lose heart, and wanted to go back, and fearing the way they were going they started to murmur on Columbus' wisdom, and of his foolhardiness. And the people and captains started to mutiny, for each hour fear grew larger in their hearts, and the hope of finding the land they searched diminished. So, they publicly and shamelessly told him that he had cheated them, that he had led them to their doom, and that the King and Queen had been wrong and cruel in trusting a man like him, and trusting a foreigner who did not know what he said. So far had arrived the situation, that they assured him that if he did not turn back the ships, they would so do against his will, or toss him into the sea.* The intervention of the Pinz #243;n brothers, who were the natural leaders of the region the sailors were from, was vital in not having Columbus thrown overboard. Columbus did have some intervention, saying that he was there with them, showing his compromise with the enterprise. However, as many complaints came from the fact that Columbus was a foreigner whose experience was unknown to the seafarers of Palos and Moguer, the fact that Mart #237;n Pinz #243;n (a veteran captain of good name), and Vicente Pinz #243;n (still young but with an impressive record at sea including several acts of piracy at ages 15 through 18) vouched for him, helped in defusing the situation.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>In the second half of the XVI century, chess gained scholarly attention, although in the late XV century some manuals had already been published. The Spanish priest Ruy L #243;pez de Segura (eponymous for the Spanish or Ruy L #243;pez opening) published in 1561 a very dettailed and analytic book on chess, with special interest in game openings. While in Italy, Ruy L #243;pez played against Giovanni Leonardo da Cutro, known as "il Puttino" and also against Paolo Boi "il siracusano", and against "l'Abruzzese" (known erroneously in Spanish sources as "El Brocense"). Some of his matches are recorded thanks to Giulio Cesare Polerio's annotations, who also registered other matches. Ruy L #243;pez is regarded as the "first world champion", a titke occasionally bestowed on Boi based on the tournanent held at El Escorial between two Spanish masters (Segura and Cer #243;n) and two Italian masters (Polerio and Cutro). You can easily find records of the matches translated into modern chess notation in many places if you are interested. Another well known chess player in Spain in the XVI century was Saint Theresa of  #193;vila (patron saint of chess players), although chess had a bit of a stigma as it was a game that involved bets, which was something morally rejected by the Church and very much improper for a nun.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>This seems like an appropriate place to retell the story of Juan Latino, born a slave in the household of the duke of Sessa, who became the first black university professor and one of the most respected intellectuals of his time. Juan Latino was born Juan de Sessa, a slave to the Count of Cabra and his wife the Duchess of Sessa, although some say he was the bastard son of the Count of Cabra and a black slave. Juan was a man of very vivid intellect, and a close friend to the dukes' son Gonzalo Fern #225;ndez de C #243;rdoba y Fern #225;ndez de C #243;rdoba. When Gonzalo was studying at the University of Granada, Juan, being a slave, could not attend the lessons, but listened from outside and learnt as much as he could with his friend Gonzalo Fern #225;ndez de C #243;rdoba. So much did he learn, that he ended up taking the graduation exam and passed it, being praised as a great latinist. He graduated as bachelor of philosophy on the 2nd of February 1546, as it is evident from the graduation document present in the archive of the University of Granada, signed by Master of Arts Benedicto del Peso. He obtained his graduate degree (licenciado) in 1557, and of master of Latin the next year. The Bishop of Granada don Pedro Guerrero could not fail to notice this man. When the position of professor of Latin language and grammar was available that year, Juan Latino was the strongest candidate for the job, and the jury composed by Pedro Guerrero, the count of Tendilla (a great latinist), and Pedro de Deza. He passed, and became the first black university professor. His presence is continuous in the records of the University of Granada, attending the University's Senate meetings in his position as professor. So much was Juan Latino's fame that he was responsible of giving the inaugural adress in 1565, an extremely high honour that clearly states Latino's fame. While he was professor of Latin, he had an affair with one of his students, Ana de Carleval, daughter of one Granada's knights 24 (councilmen), and married her. They lived happily and had four children, not having any known problems regarding their race. Juan was a highly regarded scholar in his lifetime, and for many years after that, having been lauded by Cervantes and many other authors. He died at 78 years old in Granada. Sources: Wright, E. R (2016), *The epic of Juan Latino: Dilemmas of race and Religion in Renaissance Spain.* Toronto: University Press Gonz #225;lez Garb #237;n, A (1886), Glorias de la Universidad de Granada: el negro Juan Latino, in *Bolet #237;n del Centro Art #237;stico de Granada* S #225;nchez Mar #237;n, J.A. and Mu #241;oz Mart #237;n M.N (2009), "El Maestro Juan Latino en la Granada renacentista.

    <TEXT>I have to correct this statement as it is a decontextualisation. *"I could conquer the whole of them with fifty men, and govern them as I pleased."* I will now insert the whole paragraph in the original Spanish, and then translate it: *Y para ver todo esto me mov #237; esta ma #241;ana, porque supiese dar de todo relaci #243;n a Vuestras Altezas y tambi #233;n ad #243;nde pudiera hacer fortaleza, y vi un pedazo de tierra que se hace como isla, aunque no lo es, en que hab #237;a seis casas, el cual se pudiera atajar en dos d #237;as por isla; aunque yo no veo necesario, porque esta gente es muy simplice en armas, como ver #225;n Vuestras Altezas de siete que yo hice tomar para les llevar y aprender nuestra habla y volverlos, salvo que Vuestras Altezas cuando mandaren pu #233;denlos todos llevar a Castilla o tenerlos en la misma isla cautivos, porque con cincuenta hombres los tendr #225;n todos sojuzgados y les har #225;n hacer todo lo que quisieren.* **Translation**: In order to see all this, I moved this morning so that I could give Your Highnesses a complete report on everything, and also where could I make a fortress, and saw a tract of land that appears to be an island, though it is not, on which there are six houses, which can be shortened in two days through the island; though I don't deem it necessary, for these people are very simple in weaponry, as Your Hignesses will see from seven I ordered to be taken in order for them to learn our language and bring them back, unless Your Highnesses, should they so command, could take them all to Castile, or have them captive on the island, for with fifty men shall all of them be dominated and they shall be compelled to do all you would want them to. The "fifty men" comment is specifically referring to the people in one of the small islands with a rather small population. Judging from the date and description of the lands, it is one of the Bahamas, though the identification is unclear. It is not even clear he meant that with fifty soldiers could he subjugate them all, but rather that with the fifty most principal men could he govern them all.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Having pointed out the previous decontextualisation, it is worth mentioning that Columbus was no saint, and that he acted like a tyrant when he was governor of the Indies. His tyrannical rule led to an official investigation by Francisco de Bobadilla, who interrogated 23 witnesses, and there are testimonies that can make anyone shudder. Columbus' tyranny was not specifically against the natives, he was also ruthless against the Spaniards. From Bobadilla's investigation, there arose some awful misdeeds, of which I shall only enumerate a few: \-He had Hernando de Guevara executed, throwing him from the ramparts of the town of Concepci #243;n without due process. Not only that, but Guevara had not even finished confessing the accusations brought against him. \-He had In #233;s de Malver whipped and publicly scorned for having pretended being pregnant in order to get more food from the rationing. \-The slave Luquitas was sentenced to death for stealing wheat. Columbus changed his mind, and had Luquitas' nose and ears cut off, and had the man expelled. \- He had a man nailed to the gates of a church for several days. \-A woman was punished by Bartholomew Columbus with the usual 100 whiplashes for having said that the Columbus' brothers were of low birth. \-He sold Spaniards into slavery for debts.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>The steel was not dyed or painted, it was "blued" or "blacked". This process is of uncertain origin, but it is very old, as it can be found on Portuguese swords from the XV century, specifically naval swords, and that is important. The bluing technique, which would normally result in a black coating, was produced by heat treating the steel to some 400 #186; C, and then quenching it in very specific oils, which would produce this outer layer of black material, which is ferric oxide. This coating in ferric oxide or other ferric by-products protected the metal from rust and corrosion, hence the importance for naval weaponry. This type of Portuguese swords are called "espadas pretas de bordo" which translates as "black boarding swords". On ships, with all the humidity and salinity, steel or iron would rust very quickly. The bluing or blacking technique was mastered by some of the greatest armourers of the XVI century, such as the Helmschmid family from Augsburg, or the Negroli family from Milan. The blackening or armor would give the gold ornamentation more prominence, making it contrast more against a dark background than against the silvery ordinary colour present in steel. Sadly, with the passage of time, and with cleaning and restoring, the blackening has faded away and/or been polished away. If you want to know what the armour looked like back in its day, you should check the portraits, and contrast with the current state of those armours. If you are very interested in this, I mightily recommend you travel to Madrid and visit the Royal Palace, specifically the Royal Armoury, which contains an impressive amount of XVI and XVII century arms and armour some of which still have a darker colour, evidencing that it had been blacked in its day, [like this one from 1550](https://www.patrimonionacional.es/colecciones-reales/real-armeria/armadura-de-parada-de-felipe-ii) made by Desiderius Helmschmid for Philip II of Spain.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>It very much depended on each individual pirate and the kind of sponsoring they have, and I don't necessarily mean corsairs, as they would be officially sponsored by a king or otherwise a sovereign. There are, however, some well documented cases of acts of piracy and who were the ships owners. In a letter written by the councillors of the city of Barcelona written in 1477 they complain to Ferdinand the Catholic (then King of Sicily and of Castile) about a raid they suffered. I'll translate from it: *To the very poweful lord King of Castile and Le #243;n, Sicily, and Portugal, and prince of Aragon.* *Three armed caravels arrived to the beach of this city. It is said that owner of one of them is Fernandarias Sayavedra, Pero Vascas de Sayavedra of the other, and Gonsalbo de Stunyaga of the other. The captains are called Diego de Mora, of Seville; Joan Rodrigues Floriano, of Seville; and Vicens Anes Pinson, of the village of Palos. \[...\]* So, here we have the names of the three sponsors, owners of the armed ships: Fernando Arias de Saavedra, Pedro V #225;zquez de Saavedra, and Gonzalo de St #250; #241;iga. This three men were well off: Fernando Arias de Saavedra and his brother Pedro V #225;zquez de Saavedra were knights twenty-four (councillors) of Seville, and held some other positions in Seville as well. Gonzalo de St #250; #241;iga was a lesser nobleman from the zone of Palos, and at some point was governor of the castle of Palos, though he had his lawsuits with the count of Cifuentes. These three were not the only people from Palos involved in acts of piracy, there are more and for that we have a solid paper record knowing that there were always well off merchants or lords who had piracy sponsoring a "side gig". I'll give some examples from Palos, for I know them rather well. [Sentence from 1477, for the robbery of a ship that belonged to Juan Berenguer](http://pares.mcu.es/ParesBusquedas20/catalogo/show/1599055?nm). The people involved were Juan Fern #225;nez Perete, from Palos, and behind him was Pedro Enamorado, merchant from Utrera. [Royal Commission to the Assistant of Seville from 1480](http://pares.mcu.es/ParesBusquedas20/catalogo/description/1602316?nm), to proceed against Pedro Quintero and associates for the pillage in the A #231;ores islands of some ships belonging to "Juan de Solana" and "Guillermo Pap #237;n", Englishmen, neighbours of London. Quintero's men had arrived with three armed caravels belonging to Quintero. [Royal Commission to the Assistant of Seville from 1480](http://pares.mcu.es/ParesBusquedas20/catalogo/description/1601832?nm), to proceed against Mart #237;n Alonso Pinz #243;n and Vicente Y #225; #241;ez Pinz #243;n, from Palos, for having robbed close to Ibiza a caravel belonging to Bernardo Galamo. In this case, the pirate act was conducted by the Pinz #243;n brothers, who were rather rich merchants and could act on their own. This is a tiny fraction of the piracy acts that can be described. In Spain, probably the best known act of piracy (not privateering, that goes to Piet Heyn taking the treasure fleet in Matanzas in 1616) was the capture of some of Cort #233;s' ships carrying the treasure of Cuauht #233;moc. This act was carried out by Jean Fleury (quidam Johannes Florinus, pyrata gallus, according to Peter Martyr of Anghiera), who was sponsored by a shipwright and merchant from Dieppe named Jean Ango, of great fame. From a [report to the Casa de la Contrataci #243;n in 1523](http://pares.mcu.es/ParesBusquedas20/catalogo/show/127529?nm) we know the kind of maritime muscle Fleury had. I quote: *First, a big long-ship of 102 tonnes, equipped with a 102 mean, half sailors and half for war. It is equipped with 20 metal artillery pieces. He also has iron artillery, ammunition, and supplies in good quantity.* *A ship made in Biscay, taken by the French.* *Another ship of 101 tonnes, made in Brittany* *Another 5 galleons, the largest of which is of 70 tonnes, another one of 60, other one of 50, other one of 40 made in Biscay, equipped with 200 men of war, that are soldiers who were in the siege of Fuenterrabia* The provenance is not always specified, but we know 2 ships were from Biscay and one from Brittany. The others, likely from Dieppe and Normandy, as that is where Jean Ango had his ships built. This answer is not complete, but it does give some insight on the acquisition of a number of pirate ships, which were obtained either by acts of piracy, or from the sponsoring by people who had economic interests in piracy.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>These arms pictured here can be seen in Granada, and they are not the only ones, the most notable being in the palace they had in  #218;beda (province of Ja #233;n) The arms are very much canting in Spanish (Granada is pomegranate in Spanish). There Granada Venegas were not the only Granada branch, but they can be told apart by the tinctures or disposition of the pomegranates. Granada Venegas shows the five fruits or with the meat gules in saltire on a field azure. The Venegas lineage is very old, and of well known arms, though with some variants, with fesses azure on a field argent. The inescutcheon represents the Nasrid kingdom, as the Granada Venegas descended from Yusuf IV, while also showing the conversion to christianity: where the Nasrid kingdom had gules, this is azure; gold becomes silver; and the Arabic "only Allah is victor" became "Xpus Victor". The fallen banner commemorates the battle of Adra, where Pedro de Granada captured one of the war flags of the Nasrid army. The flag is gules on a field argent. Here I leave a portrait of [a marquess of Campot #233;jar](https://www.duran-subastas.com/escuela-espa-ola-s-xvii-retrato-de-marques.html) from the XVII century.</TEXT>

Olive oil was not quite a precious commodity, but something necessary, as it had many uses: cooking, elaborating preserves like escabeche, fuel for lamps, wound cleaning, etc. This types of uses are documented in many books like the *Llibre de Sent Sov #237;* (a medieval cookbook), the *Book of Hunting Animals* by Abraham of Toledo, the anonymous *Book of Horses*, and many documents between private individuals.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Yes, there were attempts in Southern Europe, but they were fruitless. In Spain there were important reformed circles in Valladolid, Seville, and Alcal #225; de Henares, and these circles were composed of people of high education and rather rich. In Alcal #225; de Henares the protestant circle was linked to Miguel de Egu #237;a, a succesful and rich printer, with ties to the University of Alcal #225;. Miguel de Egu #237;a was from Navarre, a place that borders France. Other printers involved in the protestant circles of the center of Spain were the Brocar family, of French origin, most notably Arnao Guill #233;n de Brocar and Juan de Brocar. These two played also a role in establishing protestant circles in Toledo. In Seville, the protestant group was lead by Constantino Ponce de la Fuente, a great intellectual who had been close to Emperor Charles V and who had worked as a censor and book reviewer for the Inquisition in Triana (outskirt of Seville). Most of the people related to Ponce de la Fuente's group were rich merchants or noblemen. In Valladolid, the leader of the protestant group was Agust #237;n de Cazalla, who had been a preacher for Emeperor Charles V. The people who frequented Cazalla were very educated and well off. The least conspicuous of them was a silversmith, and the most prominent of them was the Vivero family, including a daughter of the marquess of Alca #241;ices. The protestant cenaculum in Alcal #225; eventually faded away, but the ones in Seville and Valladolid were ended in a hard way, with most of the people involved being sentenced to death at the stake. The autos de fe of Seville and Valladolid of 1559 had a very strong deterrent effect, more or less ending protestantism in Spain. Prior to these cases there had been some individual efforts to introduce the protestant doctrines in Spain, like the one made by Francisco de Enzinas and his brother Diego in 1542. Francisco had translated one of Calvin's texts, had it printed, and tasked his brother Diego with introducing 300 or 400 copies in Burgos. This effort was known by the Inquisition, as we know from internal memos, and the books ended up being discretely confiscated and destroyed, as had been asked by Francisco and Diego's uncle who was the treasurer of Burgos' cathedral. Diego would later try to preach the Reformation's doctrines in Rome, which resulted in him being burnt in the Eternal City.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I will complement your answer. Spain, being on the receiving end of the pirate business, did not hesitate in establishing anti-pirate troops, of which there are some good examples. Matx #237;n de Uranzuy (or Mach #237;n de la Renter #237;a) was a captain general tasked with fighting Barbary pirates. Some of his most notorious exploits including fending off a pirate attack on the coast of Alicante. Mach #237;n, with his galleon, repealed an attack lead by five galleons, seven galleasses, a brigantine, and five fustas. This heroic act secured him the position of captain general, a knighthood and a coat of arms. He also actively fought against Haji Drub, known as Drub the Devil (in Spanish known as Cachidiablo), and disabled Barbarossa's guns in a raid against Oran. Mach #237;n was the father of Juan de la Renter #237;a, a captain of great fame who took part in the capture of the French pirate Jean Fleury, the man who had taken two of Cort #233;s' three ships carrying Moctezuma's treasure. He also took prisoner the French corsair the Baron of Saint Blancard, which secured him a promotion to general. The most important anti-pirate Spanish naval officer was Antonio Barcel #243;, of the late XVIII century. He had been protecting Spanish ships against Barbary pirates, until he suggested a different strategy: not defending, but attacking. In 1781 and for the next few years, he commanded yearly raids against the city of Algiers with all the mifht he could gather. Every year he bombarded the city causing severe damages to substantial portions of it, until the Bey of Algiers was forced to capitulate and stop the raids, thus putting an end to the age of Barbary piracy in Spain. Barcel #243; became a proverbial figure in his native Baleares, where the phrase "being braver than Barcel #243; by sea" or "being more fortunate than Barcel #243; by sea" is still in usage.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I just checked the original Latin text to know what verb was used in that phrase: "Si aliquis homo pignorauerit sarracenum uel sarracenam uicini sui mittat eum in palacio meo, et dominus sarraceni uel sarracene det ei panem et aquam quia est homo et non debet ieiunare sicuti bestia" The usage of the verb "pignorare" clears any doubts arising from the English translation. "Pignorare" means to give or to take something as a guarantee of payment. So, the concept is clear: if a man takes a saracen man or woman from another person as a collateral or guarantee, he should send that saracen man or woman to the royal palace, and the master of that saracen man should at least feed him. Odd as it may sound, this all makes sense in context. The master of the saracen man would be thus forced to pay for some of the expenses derived of having the man in custody, hence avoiding the outsourcing of costs towards the creditor. Slavery existed, and slaves, being properties, could be used as guarantees of payment.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>The man who put forward the claim was my mentor Jes #250;s Varela Marcos in his book "Castilla descubri #243; el Brasil en 1500". His claim is absolutely substantiated not only from documents in the Registry of the Court's Seal, but also from the General Archive of the Indies, in Seville. Besides this, there is the Juan de la Cosa map from the year 1500, which contains an annotation on the Brazilian coast saying "esta tierra fue descubierta por Vicentyans, a #241;o MCCCCLXXXIX". As a matter of fact, Vicente Y #225; #241;ez Pinz #243;n did not land in the coast of Brazil in 1499, but in the early days of 1500. The expedition, however, had set sail from Andalusia in late November 1499, hence the error by Juan de la Cosa in dating the expedition. Gonzalo Fern #225;ndez de Oviedo, the great chronicler of the Indies, and a good acquaintance of Vicente Y #225; #241;ez Pinz #243;n not only comments on that expedition, but gives a detailed account, including the impressions Pinz #243;n had when seeing the great Amazon river (known then as Mara #241; #243;n). Alongside Vicente Pinz #243;n, for some time as he set sail later, was the explorer Diego de Lepe, who in the same expedition discovered part of Brazil's coast. The ships with Castilian flags and the Castilian flags along the coast of Brazil in Juan de la Cosa's map are there in order to indicate the different captainships-governatorates of the different Spanish explorers. Sadly, Diego de Lepe's captaincy is nearly lost in the map as there is a chunk of paint that peeled off during the many misfortunes of the map throughout the centuries. Pinz #243;n's voyage of the year 1499-1500 is also recorded in the 1501 book "Decade de Orbe Novo" by Peter Martyr of Anghiera, where he dates Pinz #243;n's arrival to Brazil in January the 26th 1500. Cabral, on the other hand, landed in a different part of Brazil, and he did so several weeks later than Vicente Y #225; #241;ez Pinz #243;n and Diego de Lepe.</TEXT>

Being in past tense, and knowing Pinz #243;n made its way back to Palos in 1501, it is evident that the document refers to the voyage of 1499-1500, where he discovered a whole lot of land (from cape Saint Augustine to the mouth of the Amazon river).</TEXT>

    <TEXT>*Voyages took months from the mainland.* This point is fundamentally wrong. Columbus' first voyage sailed from Palos on August the 3rd 1492 and arrived to Guanahanin on October the 12th of the same year. However, he was not for two months at sea. He took one week to get to the Canary Islands, but he stayed there for 33 days rapairing the ships, getting supplies, and allegedly having an affair with Hern #225;n Peraza's widow. So, the sailing time from was somewhat over a month, and not several months. Columbus' second voyage set sail from Gran Canaria the 2nd of October 1493, and arrived in the Caribbean islands on November the 3rd, which is a month of travel. His third voyage took also about one month, sailing from La Gomera on June the 21st 1498, arriving to Cape Verde in a matter of one week. From Cape Verde he set sail on July the 4th, and arrived to Trinidad on July the 31st. Vicente Y #225; #241;ez Pinz #243;n, on his expedition of 1499-1500, sailed from Palos on November 19th 1499, and went to the Canary Islands. From there, he went to Cape Verde. He sailed from Cape Verde on January the 12th 1500, arriving to cape Santo Agostinho on January the 26th. All of these cases are of the earliest voyages are from the very early times of the American navigation, making it relatively hard for smallpox to arrive easily to the Americas. Bear in mind that the incubation period of the sickness is some 12-17 days, and then symptoms start to manifest. In later times, travel times were significantly reduced, making it easier for smallpox to arrive</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Long story short, it's because in Europe there had been much more efficient animals for meat, fibers, and labour. A llama can weigh between 150 and 200 kilos, and can carry some 35-40 kilos. Compare that to an ox, that normally wheighs three times as much and can drag carts twice its weight. Then we have the female counterpart: the cow, with a weight of 400 kilos or more, and which produces important amounts of milk. The hide of the cow or the bull is also useful, and can be used as leather or turned into parchment. For fibers, we had in Europe colossal amounts of sheep, which means an enormous production of wool, of easy obtention. Also, the reproductive cycles of sheep is far shorter than that of llamas: a sheep reaches sexual maturity around 8 months old, whileas llamas reach it at 12 months also. The gestating period of a sheep is 5 months, while the llama takes nearly a year to give birth.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>The Spanish Inquisition did question confessions extracted by means of torture, and did so from the very earliest of their times. In the Instructions for Inquisitors, which is the rulebook, you can see in articles 49-53 of the addenda by Diego de Deza in 1498, that they had many reserves about this kind of confessions. I translate: *49. \[...\] Experience teaches us that the accused, in that agony, would confess anything that is suggested to them, which causes damages to third parties, and occasion for their confessions to be revoked.* *50. The Inquisitors shall carefully examine whether the sentence of torment is justified or not, and preceded by legitimate evidence. In case they have issues with this, or doubts, as the damage could be irreparable, for in cases of heresy interlocutory sentences can be appealed, shall then the appeal be granted. \[...\] When in doubt, appeal shall always be granted. Also, the sentence of torment shall not be executed until the cause is concluded, and having received the accused's defendants.* *53. Twenty four hour having passed after the torment, the accused shall ratify his confessions, and in case he revokes them, he shall be repaired as provided by the Law.* These legal guarantees (like having the right to leagl assistance and in case you can't afford one be it provided for you at the Court's expenses), as well as the others present in the Inquisitors Instructions, resulted in the Inquisition having a rather meager conviction rate. As for witch trials, in Spain they were excedingly rare, and the whole concept of withcraft was dismissed in 1612 by a Pragmatic from the Supreme Council of the Inquisition, wherein it is explained that witchcraft is nothing but neighbours acting in bad faith, and cases of mass hysteria.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>No, he wasn't. The amount of contemporary evidence for Columbus being Genovese is absolutely enormous, with testimonies from everywhere. Let's get into business: Columbus had a meeting with the Catholic Monarchs in 1491, for discussing the voyage to the Indies. For this kind of business, you had to go through the Court's registrar, in this case Doctor Lorenzo Gal #237;ndez de Carvajal, whose short registry we possess. In that year it is said: *Capitulation with Christopher Columbus, genovese, natural of Savona, for the discovery of the Indies* Angelo Trevisan, secretary to the Venetian ambassador before the Catholic Monarchs, in the year 1500-1 managed to become a good friend of Chritopher Columbus, whom he always mentions as "genovese" (zenovese, in Venetian language). Thanks to Christopher Columbus, he procured himself a copy of a navigation chart of the Indies, made in Palos (today Palos de la Frontera). One of the letters reads: *Cristoforo Columbo, zenovese, homo di alta et procera statura, rosso, de grande inzegno*... (Christopher Columbus, genovese, man of remarkable and tall height, redhead, of great ingenuity) The ambassador of the Catholic Monarchs before the Court of Henry VII, Ayala, writes in 1497 a letter to his sovereigns stating that the King of England has hired a navigator, a certain Cabot, "genovese like Columbus". Christopher Columbus himself, in a letter from 1501, as a sign of eternal gratitude, wanted to bequeath 10% of his income from the Indies to the city of Genoa, and so he instructs his friend Nicol #243; Oderigo, genovese ambassador, to sort out the paperwork. Bureaucracy being bureaucracy, they manage to never respond to Columbus, which lead to Columbus not bequeathing that. This was cancelled in 1504, in a letter that I translate: *Virtuous sir: When I departed for the voyage from which I now come, I talked to you for a long time: I think you may recall everything. I thought that when I would be back, I would find letters from you, and even a person with whom to speak. In that time I had left to Francesco da Rivarola a copying book of my letters and another one of my privileges, in a case of red cordovan leather with a lock made of silver, and two letters to the Office of Saint George, where I assigned a tenth of my income, discounted the levies on wheat and other supplies: I did not hear any news of it. Misser Francesco says everything made it to Genoa. If that is so, it was a great discourtesy not to have answered, and that is why they are not getting their estate augmented* \[...\] This Nicol #243; Oderigo, when writting to Christopher Columbus, always calls him "amantissimus concivis", which translates as "very beloved concitizen", which is a clear sign of Oderigo being aware of Columbus' origin. It is not the only case of Christopher Columbus being straightly related to Genoa. In his memorial of debts, written in articulo mortis in may 1506, in the city of Valladolid, he settles some old debts, and all of them are with genovese people (and with the genovese Bartolomeo Fieschi as witness). The most relevant part, is that we know the exact nature of two of those debts: 1. A debt with Paolo de Negro and Lodisio Centurione Scotto. This one matches a debt recognised before a notary in 1478 by a certain Cristoforo Colombo, citizen of Genoa, aged 27, who was due to depart to Lisbon on the morrow. 2. A debt to Gerolamo da Porto, father of Benedetto da Porto chancellor in Genoa. This one matches a debt contracted in 1470 by a certain Cristoforo Colombo, citizen of Genoa, aged 19, son of Domenico Colombo. Gonzalo Fern #225;ndez de Oviedo, in his General and Natural History of the Indies, book II, specifically says the Columbus was from Liguria, though he is not exactly sure from where, doubting between Savona, Nervi, and Cogoleto. Let's keep in mind that Gonzalo de Oviedo was raised alongside Christopher Columbus' sons, and met the man in more than one occasion. Bartolom #233; de las Casas, a good friend of Hernando Col #243;n, everywhere mentions that Columbus was from Genoa. In fact, in several passages he mentions "Antonio Colombo, Genovese, a relative of the Admiral", because that Antonio is a recurring character. That Antonio was one of Columbus' cousins. Diego Col #243;n de Toledo, III Admiral of the Indies, when he had to testify his ancestry in order to get knighted as member of the order of Santiago (1535), reports this about his grandfather: "*He says his grandfather was Don Crist #243;bal Col #243;n, and that he was Genovese, born in Savona, a town close to Genoa*". There is plenty more evidence from all sorts of contemporaries of Columbus accrediting he was genovese, including a number of people from Genoa like Bartolomeo Sen #224;rega, Antonio Gallo, and cardinal Giustiniani. Antonio Gallo would be worth mentioning on its own, as he knew Columbus at a young age, as both lived in the same street in Genoa. Portuguese sources from the time mention Columbus as ligur, genovese, or italian, none of them calling him Portuguese. Oddly enough, the least trustworthy source is Hernando Col #243;n, Columbus' younger son, who very frequently makes stuff up, including making entirely up his father's noble ancestry. His father of humble birth, but was relatively rich thanks in part to his political connections to the Fieschi family. Being of humble birth was not an insurmountable barrier for marrying a noblewoman, think of Hernando de Zafra (secretary of the Catholic Monarchs), "of honest plebeian parents" who married a woman of the house of Ayala, one of the oldest and most respected lineages in the whole realm of Castile. The evidence of Columbus being genovese is everywhere, and these examples are nothing but a few, and as chronologically close to the man as possible. The linguistic part shall I comment on a different note, as this one is getting all too long.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>*Nearly all letters that Christopher Columbus has written to individuals in Genoa were written in either Catalan or Latin not in Italian.* His letters are in Castilian or in Latin. First things first, Italian did not exist back then, it is a construct from the XIX century based upon the Tuscan dialect, which Columbus did not speak. In Genova, the official language of the administration was Latin until the XIX century, hence all the documents from there are in Latin, and for official businesses Latin was necessary. Columbus would have spoken Ligurian dialect, or "genovese Latin" as it was called, but unlike Tuscan or Venetian, Ligur was mostly oral like Romagnol dialect. Basically nobody wrote in Ligurian, that's why Columbus doesn't use it. *In the hundreds of documents and letters written by Christopher Columbus, not in a single one he claims to be Genoan.* #160; Dozens, not hundreds. He doesn't explicitly claim to be Genovese, but neither he claims to be from anywhere else. Except for all the official records, where he is identified as "genovese natural of Savona", but that is not from his own hand, rather from his own mouth. *In some notes Columbus wrote on his copy of Natural History by Pliny the Elder some notes that are written in portu #241;ol, a mix between Spanish and Portuguese.* Entirely true. Christopher Columbus' Spanish was heavily contaminated by a previous learning of Portuguese. All of the linguistic traits have been excellently analysed by Ram #243;n Men #233;ndez Pidal in his book "La lengua de Col #243;n". Let's not forget that the first language he learned to write was Latin, and the first alive language he learned to write was Portuguese. *The Genoan ambassadors in Castille when reporting to Genoa about the discovery of the new world forgot to report one important detail : that Columbus was a fellow countryman* Entirely made up. They knew he was from Genoa, the Senate of Genoa knew it too, Gallo and Sen #224;rega mention that, and there were public feasts in Genoa celebrating Columbus' feat. *His son Ferdinand was unaware of his father's origins and even traveled to Genoa in attempt to find the roots and family of his father.* #160; He was entirely aware of his father's origins, but he constantly makes stuff up to try cover up the fact that his father was of plebeian birth. This is the explicit reason of his animosity with cardinal Giustiniani, and his distancing from Gonzalo de Oviedo. *Columbus used a triangular signature of dots and letters in some of his documents that resembled inscriptions found on gravestones of Jewish cemeteries in Spain.* #160; Columbus' signature is a mystery, and so it will always remain, I think. The dots and whatnot were something that Columbus considered important enough as to mention in his will that his signature (and he describes it in detail) shall be used by his successors, so that means he thought of it as some sort of mark of his office of Admiral. As for Jewish gravestones, I'm not familiar with that.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>When Columbus died he was accompanied by very few people: some franciscan friars, the notary, three witnesses, and Bartolomeo Fieschi. We don't know the rites performed, but they would have been the usual stuff from franciscan friars. The only piece of evidence about his death is the diary of Rodrigo de Verdesoto, councillor of the town of Valladolid, who wrote: [May 20th 1506]. "On this day the Admiral of the Indies died. He was buried in the calasostra, in the chapel of Luis de la Cerda, Duke of Medinaceli" As an aside, the remains of this chapel are now being dug up in Valladolid (Constituci #243;n street) in search of the tomb of Red Hugh O'Donnell, buried there in 1602.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>In case you are interested, there is facsimilar edition of Columbus' book of privileges, exactly the one mentioned in the letter. Even the case of red cordovan leather, thouugh not the silver lock. The facsimilar edition, complete with a transcript and an English translation, was made by Henry Harrisse from the original preserved in the archive of the French Ministry of Foreign Affairs, and you can find a digital reproduction in Cervantes Virtual (I'll post the link in a moment). The other copy sent to Genoa is preserved in Genoa, in the Municipal Palace.

    <TEXT>I just found the letter, his charter of mayorazgo, where Columbus describes his signature. His way of describing it is rather unique: *D. Diego, mi hijo,  #243; cualquier otro que heredare este Mayorazgo, despu #233;s de haber heredado y estado en posesi #243;n de ello, firme de mi firma, la cual agora acostumbro, que es una X con una S encima, y una M con una A romana encima, y encima della una S y despu #233;s una Y griega con una S encima con sus rayas y v #237;rgulas, como yo agora fago, y se parecer #225; por mis firmas, de las cuales se hallar #225;n muchas.* *Y no escribir #225; sino el Almirante puesto que otros t #237;tulos el Rey le diese  #243; ganase: esto se entiende en la firma y no en su ditado que podr #225; escribir todos sus t #237;tulos como le plugiere; solamente en la firma escribir #225; el Almirante* **Translation**: Don Diego, my son, or whosoever should inherit this mayorazgo, after having inherited it and being in possession of it, shall sign with my signature that now I regularly use, that is an X with an S above, and an M with a Roman A above, and above it an S, and after that a Greek Y with an S above it, with its lines and virgules, as I do, and shall be apparent from my signatures, of which many shall be found. And shall he write nothing but The Admiral, regardless of any other titles he should be granted by the King or earn: this is to be understood for the signature, and not when dictating, where he shall be able to write all of his titles in any way he pleases; only in the signature shall he write The Admiral.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>There is a whole lot of things wrong in there. 1- He did not take 25 Lucayans to be sent to Castile. He took seven, with only six making it to Barcelona. The other one died in Baiona shortly after Mart #237;n Pinz #243;n made it back to Spain. 2- "With 50 men I could conquer them all and govern them as I please". He doesn't say that in his Diary of the first navigation. Talking about one of the Bahamas, he mentions that he took a few people to be sent to Spain to teach them the language. He also remarks that with 50 of the principal men, he could have them captive on the islands, and have their subjects do what the Kings would require. 3- The chopping of ears and noses. There is one only case of that, and it is from prosecutor Bobadilla's inquiry. He found that Columbus had sentenced the slave Luquitas to death for stealing half a fanega of wheat. Columbus changed his mind and had his ears and nose chopped off. Columbus was also extremely brutal to the Spaniards, like in the case of In #233;s de Malver, who faked being pregnant in order to get some extra wheat from the rationing. Columbus had her paraded naked on a donkey, and gave her 100 whiplashes. This type of brutality caused him to be stripped of his ranks and titles. 4- The taking of native girls for sexual services is something Columbus denounces in a letter to Juana de Torres, nurse of prince John. It is not something committed by him, not even mentioned in Bobadilla's inquiry.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>He did not. That excerpt is from his letter to Juana de Torres, in which he is not saying he did that, but denouncing the terrible state in which the colonies are. I quote and translate: *Supiera yo remediar todo esto y lo otro que est #225; dicho y ha pasado despu #233;s que estoy en las Indias, si me consintiera la voluntad  #225; procurar por mi bien propio y me fuera honesto. Mas el sostener de la justicia y acrecentar el se #241;or #237;o de sus Altezas fasta agora, me tiene al fondo.

But upholding Justice, and enlarging Their Highnesses realm up to now has me in tatters. Nowadays, that so much gold can be found, there is division of opinions on where is there more gain to be made: from stealing or toiling the mines. For a woman a hundred castellanos are paid, as much as for a good farm, and it is very frequent, and there are many merchants looking for girls: nine or ten years old are now appreciated, but a good merchant must have them of all ages.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I have seen everything said about Columbus. My former boss at the House-Museum of Christopher Columbus (Valladolid), used to have a folder in his computer called "Col #243;nQu #233;", where we stashed all the news that kept popping up about Columbus, more precisely about his origin: Catalan, Galician, Castilian, Balearic, French, Greek, Croatian, Norwegian, English, Portuguese, Half-Polish, and my own personal favourite (Armenian). As for the shitshow coming from America, I am not surprised in the least. Columbus was a complete and utter bastard, but he is responsible for finding a new world, and joining it to the old world, which is something entirely remarkable and worth commemorating. I actually prefer Vicente Y #225; #241;ez Pinz #243;n over Columbus, though. The greatest sailor to have ever been born in Spain, in my opinion.

    <TEXT>The closest thing Europe got to a plague from the Americas was syphillys, but it cannot quite count as a plague, as the transmission of the bacterium responsible for it is through sexual intercourse. This type of transmission is much less efficient than saliva droplets, which is the way the flu (or the common cold, or the coronavirus as of right now) is transmitted, and why it is so infectious. However, syphillys did have an important prevalence in Europe, though not to the point of being a plague. Syphillys came to Europe through the Columbian exchange. Let's keep in mind that a lot of the people that went to the Indies in the earliest of times were sailors and seafarers, especially from Andalusia, but there was also a significant number of soldiers. Soldiers and sailors are the perfect way of spreading sexually transmitted diseases: they travel a lot, and they frequent a number of women, most notably prostitutes. In the case of sailors, popular wisdom says, and not without a basis, that they have a girl in each port. This leads to many seafarers frequenting the same woman at a certain point, which results in the fact that if one has the bacterium, he will give to the woman, who will give it to another man, who will eventually pass it on to other women, so on and so forth. When king Charles VIII of France invaded the Kingdom of Naples in the last years of the XV century, his armies encountered syphillys there. The Kingdom of Naples had, for the past century, had a strong connection with the Crown of Aragon, and had been ruled by the Aragonese kings at different points. Sicily, adjacent to the Kingdom of Naples was a possession of the Crown of Aragon. After the marriage of Ferdinand of Aragon to Isabella of Castile, the links to Naples extended to the Crown of Castile, with many Castilian troops taking part in the Neapolitan wars. One such example is Vicente Y #225; #241;ez Pinz #243;n, who had taken part as a captain in the first Columbian journey (1492-1493). Pinz #243;n received a royal command in 1495 ordering him to be with his ship (and crew) in Tortosa or Barcelona as of January 1st 1496 in order to transport supplies and cash to the troops stationed in Sicily. His crew was mostly from Palos, a place described by Angelo Trevisan as "un villazo ove non si trovan salvo che marinari et homini pratichi di quel viazo del Columbo" (a village where there are only seafarers and experienced men from Columbus' voyage). This is a very likely vector for syphillys to arrive in Sicily, and from there to Naples. This is the closest Europe got to a plague from America, but still begs the question on why the Europeans did not catch any actual plagues, and the answer is that there was no such thing in preColumbian America. Plagues come from domesticated animals, and those are and were to be found in abundance in Europe, but not in America. In America there were no cows from where cow pox could jump species and become smallpox, there were no pigs from which swine flu could jump and turn into something more devastating to humans, no chickens from which chicken pox could pass on to humans, and so on and so forth. There were no plagues as we know them, but the closest thing there was turned out to be devastating enough.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Spain never did such a thing, but we need to get into the matter of how or why did Spain not venture that far North in North American territory, which requires a quick point on the logistics. So, as good old Jack said, let's go piece by piece: *the east coast is a straight shot from Spain* This point is geographically correct, but logistically incorrect. Spain is indeed in the same latitude as the former territory of the American 13 colonies, but the maritime currents make it unfeasible to travel straight from Spain to New York, as you would be going against the Gulf Stream, and quite against the winds. [Here you have a map](https://static.scientificamerican.com/sciam/assets/Image/AMOC_graphic_modified-01.png) showing the most important currents in the North Atlantic. Spain's ordinary route for going to the Americas was through the Canary Islands. Ships would normally sail from Andalusia: Palos, as in Columbus' first voyage; or C #225;diz, in Columbus' second voyage would be the ideal starting points, as proven by the many expeditions that departed from there. Vicente Pinz #243;n, Alonso de Ojeda, Juan de la Cosa, Amerigo Vespucci, Alonso V #233;lez de Mendoza, Diego de Lepe, Rodrigo de Bastidas, etc sailed from the Atlantic coast of Andalusia, and from then went to the Canary islands. From these islands, you can profit from the Canaries' Current, that would guide you to the Leeward isles or to the coast of Brazil (vide Pinz #243;n's discovery of Brazil, Columbus' second journey, or Diego de Lepe's expedition of the year 1500). This, and Columbus' first two journeys lead to Castile establishing settlements in Hispaniola and Cuba, for they were the most convenient islands for travelling, and they still were in the late XVIII century when the Count of Aranda proposed a plan to divide the Spanish America into three kingdoms, leaving Cuba, Puerto Rico, and Santo Domingo as possessions of the Spanish Crown that would act as advanced commercial points and in some measure as freeports. Cuba, Havana in particular, was the last stop of the Treasure Fleet before sailing into the high seas en route to Spain. Check the above attached map to see the route. With the government established in Santo Domingo, and having a captain-generalcy in Cuba, the Spaniards could venture into the conquest of the continent. Cort #233;s and his men set sail from Cuba, arrived in Mexico, and the rest is a very long digression. Mexico, being heavily urbanised, became a capital city, and it could not have happened otherwise. Soon, Mexico displaced any other city in the Spanish America and became a metropolis of its very own, with the viceroys managing the ordinary stuff as if they were kings. This meant that expeditions for discovery and conquest of new territories would depend on the viceroys and the Real Audiencia (the Court of Justice). Expeditions like the ones lead by Hernando de Soto, Alvar N #250; #241;ez Cabeza de Vaca, O #241;ate, and others depended on Mexico, and to a lesser degree on Cuba. Now come to think of how immensely far away the land of the 13 colonies id from Mexico, and how logistically difficult would it be for the viceroy of Mexico to send people there, let alone administer those territories. Spain simply never had the logistics or manpower to venture into those Northern lands. So, back to the original question: Spain nevery gave that territory, for it was never under any sort of Spanish control</TEXT>

    <TEXT>The duel that never happened: Charles V versus Francis I of France. At the battle of Pavia, Francis I of France was taken prisoner by Alonso Pita da Veiga, Juan de Urbieta, and Diego D #225;vila, men at arms of Charles V's army. This resulted in Francis I being taken captive, and held captive in Madrid's Alc #225;zar for a year, captivity that ended with the Treaty of Madrid of 1526, which lead to Francis leaving his two sons as hostages in order to guarantee his not bresking the clausesbof the treaty. However, as soon as he was in France, he denounced the treaty of Madrid as abusive and claimed he signed it while captive, meaning he could not excercise his free will. Francis I soon afterwards sent envoys to Madrid challenging Charles V to a singular combat in order to settle their dispute over Burgundy and the duchy of Milan. Charles V took some time to consider the proposal, and consulted the grandees of Spain and his closest counselors. The opinion was unanimous: Charles should never accept the duel, for a variety of reasons. The most interesting one came from the Admiral of Castile, who argued that a knight was equal to any other knight, but having Francis I broken his oath of respecting the treaty, he was deprived of honour and no longer a true knight, meaning the challenge was null as he was not in any capacity to challenge a knight. Charles, imbued of the knightly spirit of the Renaissance, accepted the duel, much to the concern of his counselors. He had the great Kolman Helmschmied and his apprentices brought to Spain so they would create an armour for the duel, which is now known as Karolud Divus armour, and kept at the Royal Armoury of the Royal Palace in Madrid. Charles sent his heralds to Francis I accepting the duel, proposing a date, and that it happened in a safe place by the river Bidasoa, natural border between Spain and France. He even left Francis the chance of the duel being fought by means of a champion, something that would have been safer to both kings but which would have meant an inevitable victory for Charles*. This resulted in Charles V gaining a lot of popularity amongst his Spanish subjects, who started to see him as a true knight, and a brave prince. Francis I refused to receive Charles V's heralds carrying the day, time, and place proposal. This led to Francis I losing any credit he could have had as a knight, and started to be considered a coward for chickening out of the duel he had proposed in the first place. The letters from the 42 lords, prelates, and counselors advising Charles V are preserved in the Archivo General de Simancas, with the call number Estado 8815, in a folder named "Desaf #237;o de Carlos V y Francisco de Francia". *Nobody doubts that Charles V would have appointed colonel Diego Garc #237;a de Paredes as his champion, a man of colossal height, build, and strength, who had never lost a duel. Paredes was 2.06 meters tall and of very muscular build, think of Hafthor Bj #246;rnsson to get an accurate picture of the man.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Not exactly a ritual of drinking a specific beverage, but in Spain, prior to the introduction of coffee, or the popularisation of chocolate, the beverage most commonly associated with breakfast was wine, odd as it may sound to present-day eyes, and the testimonies linking wine with breakfast are very abundant. I'll translate a few cases, as they cover many social strata. Diego Duque de Estrada, a famous captain who wrote his memoirs around 1640, mentions this passage in them, as many presents were brought to him, bordering on the absolute hilarity due to the absurd quantity of food brought to him: *They called for me and said that misser Jeronimo Resti, recognising he was in debt to me sent me that small present so that I could have for breakfast or snack, and the expected me for lunch, and that I would be lodged in his house with as many comrades as I wished \[...\] The present were two very large baskets of turkeys, capons and much more game, with many different dressings, all in fine silverware. Two more large baskets of excellent hams, and salami. Two more with the whitest and best bread that I had ever seen. Two more of very exquisite fruits. Two deers, two wild pigs, and half a barrel of wine* The anonymous author of "**La vida de Estebanillo Gonz #225;lez**" (1646), a picaresque novel, contains this particularly funny moment of Esteban as a heavy drinker: *They roasted the sardines for me, and just from the smell of them at the flames, I drank half a dozen cups of wine, and with their taste eighteen more. I asked the hostess how much I owed her, and looking at from feet to head, said:* *- You have drank no more than 24 cups, two shillings apiece; had I got 24 patrons of such a good quality, my husband would soon be a knight twenty-four of Seville.* *I paid what she requested, and said that it was a short breakfast for what I accustombed to drink.* Francisco Santos, in **Las tarascas de Madrid** (1665), gives us this quote, with wine and breakfast: *The butler hears them, and comes to greet them with courtesy, and so that they will know him (because he knows what people are those) and sends for wine for them to have breakfast, as he thinks they are going to need it.* Juan de Zabaleta, in **El d #237;a de la fiesta por la ma #241;ana** (1645), has a funny character make this remark about the importance of a good breakfast: *The nobleman commands to have some biscuits and some good wine for breakfast. This is better for having good blood than being a descendant of Xerxes* Pedro Calder #243;n de la Barca, in his remarkable **Entrem #233;s de las carnestolendas** (1646) has this quick passage between Luisa and the gracioso: *\[Luisa comes out with a plate and a jar of wine\].* *LUISA- Here you have your breakfast* *GRACIOSO- It's little, but enough for onw.* These are but a few examples to illustrate the fact that breakfast in the Spanish Golden Age involved having wine, which is prior to the popularisation of coffee, and even the popularisation of chocolate, which was expensive and not something statistically significant, as it was for the upper classes. An important remark has to be made, and it is the fact that wine, as far we know, was less strong in alcoholic content, and would frequently be served watered down. This is not quite a ritual, but rather the ordinary state of affairs. This is also, of course, strictly limited to Spain, which is my area of knowledge</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I happen to have a full volume of Columbus' letters, including this letter to Juana de Torres who had been a nurse to prince John. I will translate a whole section of it, with its adequate context, and make a few necessary comments on the matter: \[Bobadilla\] *had indignated them against me, saying that I wanted to take from them what Their Highnesses had given them, and worked to throw them all against me, and so he did, and that they should write to Their Highnesses that I should be no longer in office, and for that I myself pray so far as there is no more people, and with his inquiry he maligned me very much, inquiring on so evil things that not even in Hell had such things ever been heard of.* *There you have Our Lord, who helped Daniel escape, and the three boys, with as much wisdom and strength as he had, and with so much industry as he pleased.* *I wish I could remedy all this, and the other things that has been said, and that has happened after I am here in the Indies, if will would allow me to procure for my own good, and that would be honest towards me. But upholding justice and the enlargement or Their Highnesses' realm has me completely sunk. Today, that so much gold is found, there is division on where is there more to gain, in theft or in toiling the mines. For a woman, a hundred castellanos are paid, as much as for a good farmstead, and it is very much in fashion, and there are many merchants who are looking for girls: of ages nine or ten are now appreciated, but a good merchant should have of every age. \[...\]* *I assert that the ill speaking of the turbulent people has caused me more damage than my services have profitted me: bad example is this for the present or for the future.* *I swear that a number of people have gone to the Indies that did not deserve water before the eyes of God or the world, and now they are going back there \[to whence they came\].* This assertion of not deserving water is a broad generalisation, not referring specifically to the slave merchants, but to a wide number of people, and he was not wrong in saying that, and I would argue that he would be amongst them. One of the people he blames the most is Francisco de Bobadilla, the pesquisidor (attorney) sent by the Crown to investigate Columbus' management of the territory, and the claims of corruption, tyranny, and mismanagement. Columbus, in this letter to Juana de Torres, complains bitterly that Bobadilla has turned the whole island against him, when such a thing is not true: Bobadilla was a consequence, not a cause. Francisco de Bobadilla was sent to investigate what many people had reported previously to the Crown, he did not make the accusations out of thin air. About the alleged sex slavery, it is not really clear from that letter, but I would rule that meaning out. Sexual abuse of young girls not only is considered criminal now, but so was it back then. If we consider the fact that Columbus mentions the sell of girls being rather in vogue, one can only think of the regular kind of slavery, or in this case having women and girls as domestic servants. This I am not pulling out of thin air, it was very much a given that women would do domestic chores, and it was even later compiled in the Laws of Burgos-Valladolid of 1512-13 that pregnant women and young girls would be limited to domestic work, as a contrast with the males ploughing the fields or toiling the mines.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Columbus was not the only historical actor, on that we all agree, he was just the first. Rape was indeed very prevalent from the very first voyage, and at least Spanish historians agree that Mart #237;n Alonso Pinz #243;n was one of the worst amongst Columbus' first voyage. It is said, though there is not a strong consensus as of now, that he contracted syphillis on the first voyage, which resulted in his death upon arrival to Palos. This may be a bit of a stretch, considering what we know of syphillis and the time it takes to have lethal effects. Columbus dealt in slaves, forbidden though it had been, and on the second voyage he brought some 1,200 to Spain, which resulted in the Queen being mighty pissed and forcing him to take them back to America. This was not executed in full, as it was public and notorious that some nobles had Indian slaves some time after the fact, though most did not survive due to the colder weather and the lack of immunity to Old World diseases. Think of the great flu epidemic of 1518 that decimated the tainos in Hispaniola, Cuba, and Puerto Rico.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>In that letter he is condemning a great many things, but in general terms one can see a bitter and sorrowful man who has seen his governatorate go down the drain, the island in an awful state, and his prestige disappear. Only after being taken prisoner by attorney Bobadilla does he seem to realise all of the terrible things that were going on. He had the power to stop these abuses, but he didn't. Let us not forget that he was Admiral (with all the rights and privileges of the admiral of Castile), captain general, viceroy (just short of being a king), and governor (with civil and criminal jurisdiction, low and high). Columbus was a slaver himself, even though he had been sanctioned for it after the first and second voyages for enslaving and selling indigenous people.</TEXT>

Copy of a letter from the marquess of Aytona](http://pares.mcu.es/ParesBusquedas20/catalogo/description/3618179). Aytona notifies King Philip III of the privilege he has obtained from the Pope allowing the crown to set up a "juro" (obligation) of 20,000 ducats a year on the income from the order of Santiago, Alc #225;ntara, and Montesa in favour of Marcos Fugger. This one is very much a classic. The monarchs woud set titles of obligation upon some of the Crown's income, which would be taken over by the person to whom the title was given. An example of this would be Christopher Columbus in 1493, receiving a letter for 10,000 ducats, payable on the Crown's income from the butcheries' of C #243;rdoba. The difference with the one mentioned here by Aytona is that the Columbus one was a one-off thing, while the juro given to Marcos Fugger was perpetual until the debt was redeemed in full. [1632. Deposit at the Bank of Saint George in Genova](http://pares.mcu.es/ParesBusquedas20/catalogo/show/3678722) of a certain amount of money paid to the Fuggers, supported by a certain royal charter. A straight up payment in cash in a reputable bank, nothing extraordinary, not even the fact of it being in Genova, especially knowing the prestige and solvency of the Bank of Saint George. [1537. Royal charter](http://pares.mcu.es/ParesBusquedas20/catalogo/description/1481122) to the governors of Santa Marta, gulf of Paria, and island of Cubagua at Sebasti #225;n Rodr #237;guez's request on Anton and Bartholomeus Welser's name, commanding them not to send any people there, as it is now under their jurisdction. This last case is particularly interesting, as Charles V had set the province of Venezuela as a collateral for a debt obligation. As Charles was not able to pay the debt by the deadline previously agreed upon, the Welsers foreclosed on Charles taking over part of Venezuela.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Those "famous" methods called Medieval were not, in fact, medieval, and had nothing to do with the Spanish Inquisition. In fact, most of them are neither medieval nor torture methods. Things like the iron lady, the spiders, Judas' cradle, etc are modern fabrications devised in the XIX century, but without any kind of basis. As for the Spanish Inquistion, first thing first, is that they never trusted the efficacy of torture, and you can see that more than quite well in articles 49, 50, and 53 of the Instructions of the Inquisition, which I translate here: *49. \[...\] Experience teaches us that the accused, in that agony, would confess anything that is suggested to them, which causes damages to third parties, and occasion for their confessions to be revoked.* *50. The Inquisitors shall carefully examine whether the sentence of torment is justified or not, and preceded by legitimate evidence. In case they have issues with this, or doubts, as the damage could be irreparable, for in cases of heresy interlocutory sentences can be appealed, shall then the appeal be granted. \[...\] When in doubt, appeal shall always be granted. Also, the sentence of torment shall not be executed until the cause is concluded, and having received the accused's defendants.* *53. Twenty four hour having passed after the torment, the accused shall ratify his confessions, and in case he revokes them, he shall be repaired as provided by the Law.* The Inquisition did use torture, but their methods don't look anything like the odd contraptions you see in "museums of Torture" like the one in Santillana del Mar. One has to bear in mind that the Inquistion was not allowed to draw blood or cause any permanent or lasting damage on any person, and doing so would result in the annulment of the cause. So, what torture methods did the Spanish Inquisition actually use? The three methods they knew that would not cause the witness or the accused to bleed: \-The strapado, known in Spanish as "garrucha". It is a pulley, a rather simple one. The accused or the witness would tied with his hands behind the back, and raised with a pulley that would make the upwards traction from that knot behind the back. A weight was placed in the accused's ankles, to make the torture more effective. \-The rack. This one is very famous, a peculiar contraption that would partially dislocate the joints of the shoulders and the ankles. \-The handkerchief or waterboarding. This method was made awfully famous by the CIA and the American army in Guant #225;namo. The ministers of the torment would forcefully insert a handkerchief or piece of cloth down the accused or witness' throat, and the start pouring water. This would simulate asphyxiation. The Inquisition did not have anything else in the matter of torture. The things you see as "famous methods of the Spanish Inquisition" are XIX century fabrications coming from the all too imaginative minds of gothic and romantic writers, and they are attributed to the Spanish Inquisition based on the fame the Inquisition had, stemming from Black Legend propaganda. The truth is that the Inquisition had actual legal guarantees, like the right to an attorney, and in case you could not afford one, the Court would appoint one for you, at the Court's expenses. And the torture methods, as I have said, were never that imaginative.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Now that you mention the Real Armer #237;a, I cannot fail but to remember the great Florentine swordsmith Antonio. He was simply known by his name, like Leonardo, Michelangelo, or Raffael, which inevitably means that his fame as a smith was such that no specification was needed. There are two fine examples of his swords in Spain. One such example is [the sword of King Ferdinand the Catholic](https://capillarealgranada.com/la-sacristia-museo/la-orfebreria/), on display at the Royal Chapel of Granada. The blade itself is a work of art, but what makes everyone's heads spin is the handle, so perfect and so well gilded. The other one is the [sword of Gonzalo Fern #225;ndez de C #243;rdoba](https://2.bp.blogspot.com/-t3_otRb2wbY/UxHMiaJT9iI/AAAAAAAAQ4U/PPCVU6_ES7o/s1600/Papa++Francisco+y+cuadros+082.jpg), known as the Great Captain, and cousin to King Ferdinand the Catholic. The sword is impeccable, but the great artistry goes in the handle and the sheath. So famous was master Antonio, that he was still a household name by the 1550s, when the Lazarillo de Tormes was first published. In the third chapter, to show the vanity of the poor squire under whom L #225;zaro serves, the guy mentions the following about his sword: * #161;Oh, si supieses, mozo, qu #233; pieza es  #233;sta! No hay marco de oro en el mundo por que yo la diese. Mas ans #237; ninguna de cuantas Antonio hizo no acert #243; a ponelle los aceros tan prestos como  #233;sta los tiene.* **Translation**: Oh, boy, if you knew what a piece this is! I would not give it away even for a mark of gold. Of the ones Antonio made, in not even a single one he set the steel so tight as this one.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>There are different and somewhat conflicting ways of starting a calendar in the Middle Ages, most notably: Anno Incarnationis/Annunciationis: The year starts on March 25th. Anno a Nativitatis Domini: The year starts on December 25th. Anno Circuncisionis Domini: The year starts on January 1st. As it is well known, the territory of Spain had a number of kingdoms in the Middle Ages, and each one used a different calendaric system, that of course changed over time. \-Catalan counties, later Principality of Catalonia. The dating system was based on the reigns of the Frankish kings. In the synod of Tarragona of the year 1180, it was decided, and soon applied, the usage of the Christian Era, and the system of Anno Incarnationis. \-Kingdom of Aragon, and kingdoms of Valencia and Mallorca. The dating system was the Anno Incarnationis until the year 1350, when king Peter IV changed it to Anno a Nativitatis Domini. In Valencia and Mallorca the change was applied in 1358. \-Kingdoms of Castile. The ordinary dating system was Anno Incarnationis, and the year was Era Hispanica (starting on 38 BCE). King John I substituted this with the Christian Era and the calendaric style of Anno a Nativitatis. \-Kingdom of Navarre. They used Anno Incarnationis from the year 1234 onwards until the XV century, when it was changed with the Anno a Nativitatis.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>This is an entirely recent phenomenon, from the XX century to be precise. Ordinarily, prior to modernity, people would proceed with their lives according to the sunlight hours, as there was no efficient way of having sufficient lighting at night. Each town, village, city, or hamlet would have its own time system, based on the solar movement, which would produce minor variations from one place to the next, but rather large on a national scale. As modernity eventually came, and with her came the trains, the national government needed to have some coherence throughout the country, and that is why on January the 1st 1901 it was enacted that the official hour was that of Greenwich, and the official calculations would come from the Navy's Observatory in San Fernando. People, however, would go with their daily businesses at the used times, and having lunch would be something happening at one post meridiem, as mentioned in cookbooks like "La Cocina Pr #225;ctica" by Picadillo. The switch in the hourly customs of spaniards came with a certain Francisco Franco, who put Spain in the Central European Time Zone on March the 15th of 1940. That is the day when everything changed and everything stayed the same. Why chose the Berlin hour? To be more in line with the Reich, and let's not forget that by that point in time Hitler was winning the war, and Franco was somehow trying to curry in favour from Hitler, whom he was unofficially helping, Spain being non-belligerent in the Second World War. With this change, the official hours of everything changed in order to be more adapted to the solar hours, and not the actual official time. So, since then Spain is very odd in clock hours, but coherent with the sunlight hours. Mart #237;n Olalla, in [an academic paper from 2014](https://arxiv.org/abs/1406.4763) analysed all of this and pointed out that *the time schedules of the activities surveyed in the polls we have analysed vary mainly due to the natural effect of the apparent revolution of the Sun around the Earth. All the statistics analysed, with the exceptions of job starting and dinner time, are situated in a bend of one solar hour. So, the Spanish time schedules are already adapted to the current time zone, and so the Spanish regions perform their activities at hours that are fully compatible with the Sun's position, though nominally late and abnormal, and comparable to the timeframes at which they are performed in Italy or Great Britain.* He also notes that *though Spain may observe the Central European Time, fifteen degrees East of its actual geographic position, performs its activities according to its meridian, that is West European Time. This is to mean that Spain does not live under a permanent jet lag.*</TEXT>

His actual name was Pedro Men #233;ndez, from Avil #233;s. Francisco L #243;pez de  #218;beda.

    <TEXT>First of all, the crest is a part of the armorial achievement. To be precise, it is the ornamental part that goes over the helmet. Second, because coats of arms were granted to specific indivuals, or used motu proprio by different individuals. Spanish heraldry being the way it is, particularly considering that the "cadency system" present in French or English heraldry does not exist, one can speak about "coats of arms of lineages". If you are a patrilineal descendant of a man who was granted or who used a specific coat of arms, you can use it, it belongs to you. Of course there are always some oddities, special provisions in the charters of mayorazgo, like the double mayorazgo instituted by Gonzalo Fern #225;ndez de Oviedo and Rodrigo de Bastidas. Or lineages that don't match a surname due to the prenuptial chapters. A good example is Hern #225;n Cort #233;s using the coat of arms of the Varillas lineage. At some point, a Varillas man married a Cort #233;s de Monroy woman, and the arrangement was such that their progeny would use the Cort #233;s surname (Cort #233;s being at that point more important than Varillas), but the coat of arms of Varillas</TEXT>

    <TEXT>In Spain, the itinerant Court stopped with King Philip II, in his early reign. In order to have a more stable administration, he chose a place where the Court would stay in a stable manner. To be precise, he chose Madrid, still the capital of Spain. As for why he chose Madrid when there a number of larger and more prestigious cities, the exact reasons are unknown, but the choice makes sense. Madrid is nearly the geographic exact centre of the Iberian peninsula, which is a good thing, being as far away from the Northern ports (Santander, Bilbao, San Sebasti #225;n) as from the Southern ports (most notably Seville), and somewhat closer to Valencia: this allows the King and the Court to be reasonably well informed. It still leaves the question on why he did not choose Toledo or Alcal #225; de Henares. Toledo was a city of ecclesiastical jurisdiction, belonging to the archbishop of Toledo, primate of the Spains. This would have been a great problem, as the King would not be the actual authority in the Court's city, diminishing his nominal and actual power. Alcal #225; would have been a perfect choice as it was a culturally important city with a very prestigious university, which could have given the Administration a steady supply of highly qualified civil servants and jurists. Alas, Alcal #225; had a mighty big problem: it was an important centre of the printing business. This may seem like a good thing, but it wasn't. Alcal #225; had had a couple of prominent protestant groups, lead by Brocar and Miguel de Egu #237;a, printers. Other important protestant cores were Valladolid and Seville (see autos de fe of Agust #237;n de Cazalla and Constantino Ponce de la Fuente), big cities with or close to large printing firms. In Madrid, with a population of 12,000, Philip II could start a capital city anew, free from ecclesiastical or nobiliary jurisdiction, and devoid of protestant shenanigans. And so he did.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>The people of Madrid did not appreciate it. Due to the lack of housing for the influx of bureaucrats, King Philip II forced the residents to temporarily house them until the city was enlarged, which took some time. The rest were kind of relieved, as not having to house the itinerant Court while it stayed in their cities meant they didn't need to foot the bill for the extra spending that having the Court in your city usually implies. I did not mention that between 1601 and 1606 the Court transferred to Valladolid, but that's a story with such a comically large amount of corruption that it's better for another time. Let's just say that the Duke of Lerma, the King's valido (some sort of omnipotent prime minister), became impressively rich with the scheme.</TEXT>

    <TITLE>When did the Roman diadems turn into more conventional crowns?</TITLE>
    <DATE>2020-06-28 07:48:25</DATE>
    <TEXT>I have been observing Roman coins for quite some time, and can't fail to notice that at some point in the byzantine period the imperial diadem looks more like a crown. On this coin, we can see Justinian wearing a classic diadem, for example. [https://assets.catawiki.nl/assets/2017/11/9/e/7/5/e7588ceb-7f0b-4006-ad55-6e38d4dcd18e.jpg](https://assets.catawiki.nl/assets/2017/11/9/e/7/5/e7588ceb-7f0b-4006-ad55-6e38d4dcd18e.jpg) This and other representations make me think that what we see in Ravenna is not a crown, but rather an imperial diadem. For what I understand, the diadem is some sort of symbol of romanitas, and I have even seen diadems in Frankish, Anglo-Saxon, and Danish coins. [Coin from Alfred the Great, with diadem](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/9/9d/Alfred_king_of_Wessex_London_880.jpg) [Coin from Knut the Great](https://www.wildwinds.com/coins/brit/cnut/Seaby_1159_Godric.jpg) So, when were diadems phased out and substituted by the crowns we associate with royalty?</TEXT>

    <TEXT>It has quite some history that sword. It was captured after the battle of Pavia (1525) by colonel Joan d'Aldana when pillaging the French camp. He also took a dagger and a book of hours. In 1586, Aldana's son sold the weapons and the book to King Philip II, and since then those things were kept at the royal armoury in Madrid, alongside the rest of the elements of the "trophy of Francis I" (the combat sword, combat dagger, a targe, and one of the gauntlets). When the French invaded Spain in 1808, Murat wanted the sword, so he could give it to Napoleon. It was soon brought to him. In the XIX century, the famous smith Zuloaga made a perfect replica that nowadays sits in the Army Museum in Toledo.</TEXT>

Don't think of it as a sign of ability to administrate corporal punishments, but something much more pedestrian. This comes from the al-qadis, the muslim equivalent of a judge/mayor. Most of the lawsuits they would resolve were about land disputes, and the rod would be the measuring instrument. That's why a well known unit of measure was the "vara" or rod, and why it was different from place to place, as the mayors would use rods of different sizes. As for the sash, I am out of clues about its origin as a symbol for mayors.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I will quote Amadeo's farewell adress, as it is rather eloquent: "Si fuesen extranjeros los enemigos de su dicha, entonces, al frente de estos soldados tan valientes como sufridos, ser #237;a el primero en combatiros; pero todos los que con la espada, con la pluma, con la palabra agravan y perpet #250;an los males de la naci #243;n #160;son espa #241;oles, todos, invocan el dulce nombre de la patria, todos pelean y se agitan por su bien; entre el fragor del combate, entre el confuso, atronador y contradictorio clamor de los partidos, entre tantas y tan opuestas manifestaciones de la opini #243;n p #250;blica, es imposible atinar cual es la verdadera, y m #225;s imposible todav #237;a hallar el remedio para tama #241;os males." Translation: If the enemies of its fortune were foreigners, I would be the first to combat them, at the head of these soldiers as brave as enduring; but all those who, with the sword or the pen, aggravate and perpetuate the illnesses of the nation are Spanish, all invoke its sweet name, all fight and revolt for its good; amongst the fray of the combat, amongst the confuse, deafening clamour of the political parties, amongst so many and opposing manifestations of publics, it is impossible to discern which one is true, and more impossuble it is to find the remedy for such terrible illnesses.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>It very much depends on each individual and context. The Spanish Habsburgs always had a very strong sense of the importance of the family. They would occasionally feud with their German/Austrian cousins, but never to the point of war or murder, for blood is thicker than water, as they say. From Philip II, we have an enormous amount of letters, both personal and official, on any given matter, which gives us a solid insight into Philip's personality. Philip lost his mother at a very young age, and his father was more than estranged, being constantly travelling, especially to Germany because of the many wars. This helped to strengthen Philip's relationship with his sisters, most particularly with Mary. He also confided a lot of matters, later in life, with his daughters, whom he loved dearly. In his letters to his sister Mary, he writes many times about raising his daughters, and they both counsel eachother on the matters of raising children. These letters are very tender and quite refute the idea of a somber man projected by Venetian ambassador Morosini and many other writers. One can see that Philip had a very good sense of humour, telling his sister and his daughters how much fun he had when he saw the dwarf Margarita getting drunk, or how he fell asleep during one of the sermons in Lisbon because the Portuguese priest was immensely boring, something quite unbecoming of the religious fanatic he is always painted as. With Mary, king Philip also shows a certain a certain mistrust of her husband Maximilian, giving her precise instruction in his letters on what she can show him, and on what Austrian matters should Mary inform her brother. Philip's daughter Catherine Michelle always was his little girl, and the letters between him and her show a solid bond, with Catherine confiding many things of her life in Savoy, even commenting on how sweet her husband is, both enjoying Turin when covered in snow when they would cross the city in a fancy sled. Catherine's death at age 29 left Philip devastated. Isabel Clara Eugenia, on the other hand, had a more political and intellectual bond, but no less affectionate by any means. The letters show the more intimate and psychological aspects of Philip, who loved his daughter to no end. The House of Habsburg always put a great emphasis on family bonds (Louis XIV's mother was Anne of Austria, let's not forget that), and it shows not only in king Philip II's correspondence, but it is a constant with the Spanish Habsburgs.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Now that you have specified it, I am going to tell one such case of urban warfare, my city in 1589. After the Spanish Armada, the English decided to counterattack, and they did so the very next year. When the English fleet came with the intent of destroying the 100 or so ships that still remained from the Armada, they could not get to Santander, where the Spanish fleet was under repair, so they tried to find another place to invade and where to set a foothold: Coru #241;a, an important port in Galicia, but with relatively few people (around 4,000). The immense English fleet or 180 ships and over 25,000 men came to the city thinking of a quick victory, but reality was very much different. The attacks started with the fleet making it to southeastern bay of Coru #241;a, as the northwestern bay is impossible for large ships (too many rocks). The city was defended by the castles of San Diego (not existing nowadays) and San Ant #243;n (currently the Archaeological Museum), from which the defenders started opening fire, trying to prevent the fleet from disembarking. The guns from the ramparts were also firing against the English ships, but all of the gunnery fire could not repeal the attack, and the English made its way to the quarter known as Pescader #237;a (the Fishermen's quarter, today city centre). The city's militia fought street by street, profiting from the knowledge of the terrain, setting up ambushes as best as they could in order to protect the civilians, who managed to seek refuge in the city itself, that had strong walls (today known as the old town). The militia suffered heavy losses, but gained the civilians all the time they could to get intra muros. Then, the militia followed suit and regrouped inside the ramparts. They numbered no more than 1,200 and were led by Juan Varela. The actual soldiers were but another 1,000, commanded by the marquess of Cerralbo, and 150 veteran arquebusiers by  #193;lvaro Troncoso de Ulloa. Throughout the next days, and for a couple of weeks, the militias and the troops organised sorties and encamisadas in order to cause damages to the English while minimising the losses. They were relatively succesful, but working on borrowed time, hoping for the actual army to eventually appear and rid them of the English invaders. Time and time again they kept harming the English, but being so completely outnumbered, they could only wait and hope for the best. Meanwhile, the English started building a tunnel for a mine with which they would demolish a part of the ramparts and start the assault, with that and sheer numbers, that city should fall within no time. The troops prepared for the assault. The mine was set on fire, but the tunnel had been slightly too long and the gunpowder too much, causing the ramparts to blow up outwards, burying 400 Englishmen in the process. Light loss, but still bad. The city's militias kept the attackers at bay for as long as they could, while the troops commanded by Cerralbo skirmished as best as they could from the Pescader #237;a, causing losses in the English rearguard. All of the fighting men of the militia were killed. Then came the assault. The English entered through the breach in the ramparts only to find corpses and no fighting men. When they entered the city, they started being attacked from the houses, with the women from Coru #241;a throwing pots, rocks, scissors, tiles, and everything with which they could kill the English. The situation turned completely nasty for the English, as they were fighting the strongest force Nature has: mothers protecting their children. The women of Coru #241;a started fighting street by street, hiding behind corners with knives on their hands, while Cerralbo's troops attacked the Englishmen from behind. If one person distinguished herself during those dark hours, it was Mar #237;a Pita, whose husband Gregorio Rocamunde had died during the siege, being of the militiamen. She led the women during that hard time. During the English assault, she had killed one of the English ensigns, taking the banner as prize. With the urban guerrilla, the sorties led by the militias, and the attacks on the rear by Cerralbo, the attack was repealed, causing enormous losses to the English. Between those who deserted, and those who died, the English casualties numbered around 12,000. Coru #241;a suffered enormously too, losing more than 1,500 people in a siege that put the city to its limit, and that was finally won by women. Mar #237;a Pita became a larger than life figure and a folk hero in Coru #241;a, obtaining from the King the rank and pay of an ensign, a yearly pension, and a royal privilege for exporting mules to Portugal. Today, the main square is named Mar #237;a Pita Square, one of the adjacent streets is named Marqu #233;s de Cerralbo, and another one is Capit #225;n Troncoso, and another important street is Capit #225;n Juan Varela.</TEXT>

    <TEXT> gt;Lazarillo de Tormes is surprisingly unconcerned with Lazarillo's psychology That is not quite entirely right. First of all we need to consider at what point does the novel start: when Lazarillo is taken as help by the blind man, and he was still a child, though a relatively grown one, so around age 12. At age twelve or around that, he was still very innocent about life, a fact illustrated by the smack given to him by the blind man against the bull's statue in Salamanca's bridge. *It seemed to me that at that instant I woke up from the simplicity in which, as a child, was asleep. I said to myself: "He speaks the truth, I should have a keener eye and be more attentive, for I am alone, and should think on how to fare for myself"* *We started our way, and in a matter of few days he taught me the jargon. And as he saw me having good wits, he was very delighted and said:* *-Neither silver nor gold can I give you, but many advices for life shall I teach you.* *And it was so that, after God, he gave me life, and being blind he enlightened me and trained me in life's course.* The boy L #225;zaro, naif was a kid as he was, starts to get more cynical from then on, seeing the miseries life has to offer to a low-born amongs the lowest borns. We get many glimpses into his psychology, and what he learns from the adversities life presents against him. He becomes full of hate towards the blind man who mistreats him, and goes so far as to probably murder him, although that point is not entirely clear: *As soon as I had finished saying it when the poor blind jumps like a male goat, and with all his strength he jumps, taking a step back for the run up, and hits his head on the post, and so strong was the sound as if he had hit a big pumpkin, and he fall on his back, half dead and with his head open. \[...\] And I left him with the many people that had gathered, and get to the village's gate in one run. I do not know what God made of him, neither cared on knowing it.* With the priest of Maqueda, seeing how hard things are due to the greed his master has, but seeing also how his life has turned from bad to worse, becomes a conformist: *With this, I didn't dare move, for I had it as faith that every step would have been worse.* With his next master, things don't get worse, but don't get any better either. The squire is poor, and L #225;zaro, knowing what it is to be poor and not eating for days on end, becomes compassionate of the man: *All in all, I liked him, seeing that he neither had nor could give any more, and had more pity than enemity towards him.* And also: *And I had not as much pity for myself as I had for my pitiful master* He still maintained a healthy dose of cynicism, being very skeptical of the matters of honour, a concept entirely foreign to a low-born as himself. These matters are very present in the dialogue about how one man should greet another (a bit of a joke on Antonio de Guevara's letter to the bishop of Palencia), when L #225;zaro says to himself "of course God is not maintaining you, as you don't allow anyone to ask for that on your behalf". The only bad feeling he had towards the poor squire was that he should lower his expectations inasmuch as the situation was dire for him. We don't have any impression on his fourth master, as that chapter is nothing but a transitional paragraph, but there is a heavy implication that L #225;zaro was sexually abused, a matter on which he does not want to speak, which is a very logical thing. His fifth master, the indulgence seller is shown as a very corrupt man, and L #225;zaro, through his POV tells us how that man conducted his businesses, without providing any actual comment, or even intervening. This chapter is the most crucial one, with L #225;zaro being nothing but a camera that shows to what point the indulgences are a scam, and the commissaries of the bull are con-men. L #225;zaro, very cynical, has just a tiny comment at the end, basically saying that the people that buy the indulgences are very innocent and that the indulgence sellers are nothing short of scammers: *How many things like this must these scammers pull amongst the innocent people!* On the final chapter, we see that L #225;zaro has matured, and even has adult worries, despite being only around 17-18 at that point, even considering the convenience of obtaining a royal office, id est becoming a public servant: *And thinking on what way of life should I take for good in order to have some rest and earn something for my older days, God enlightened me and put me on my way and in a profitable manner. With the favour I had from friends and gentlemen, all my sufferings and fatigues up to then were finally paid in attaining what I had looked for: a royal office, seeing that nobody grows but those who have them.* L #225;zaro, having at last some peace, settles with the priest of San Salvador's mistress, not caring enough about that specific point (let's not forget that matters of honour don't even bother him), despite pretending to for the appearance's sake. Thorughout the novel, the character of L #225;zaro evolves from being a naif child to a cynical boy, and eventually a man satisfied with his life. It's true that we only get glimpses of the character's psychology, not nearly as developed as Cervantes' great studies of human nature, but that is somewhat besides the point, for Lazarillo de Tormes is not a picaresque novel, it is a social denounce, and more clearly an anti-Catholic libel in the style of Lucian's novels, although the Second Part is more lucianist.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I have to agree, the Lazarillo is a modern novel just popping out of the eggshell, not a fully developed one. But most importantly, I have to insist, it is an anti-Catholic libel. That's why the first and most important circulation of the book happened in Antwerp and the Rhin's basin. It arrive relatively late to Spain, in 1553, when it was already a roaring success in the aforementioned area.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Spain's flag was created in 1785 by Antonio Vald #233;s y Fern #225;ndez-Baz #225;n, who presented King Charles III a total of 12 drawings from which to choose a new flag for the Navy. The specs the King had set were very lax: it had to be very visible at sea, and easily recognisible even with feeble winds or no wind at all. In 1843 it was declared Spain's national flag. Prior to that date it had been regulatly used by the army, and even by the people when fighting the war of Independence. The meaning of the flag? None that we know of, it was just a matter of practicality.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>It isn't accurate or reliable in any way whatsoever. The first mention we ever have of this story comes from a letter from Fray Antonio de Guevara to Garci S #225;nchez de la Vega. The letter does not have any date, probably because Guevara forgot to write it down in his copying book, something that happens to everyone every so often. Back to Guevara, his letters were published for the first time in August 1539, in Valladolid, by Francisco Fern #225;ndez de C #243;rdoba. Guevara was a very known scholar, who had been translated into a number of languages, so his letters would have been an instant best-seller. As Fray Antonio de Guevara mentions in the letter that he was visiting the populations of the Kingdom of Granada after having baptised 27,000 houses of moriscos in Valencia, we can date the letter in the years 1525-26. This is 35 years after the alleged fact, bear that in mind. It's still within living memory, but very far apart from the facts commented. I'll translate Guevara's version of the fact, with the incorrect grammar the old morisco has: *Coming to the point, you should know, my lord, that in this visit I have ten crossbowmen with me, both as guards and so that they show me this land. And, as I climbed a hill from which you lose sight of Granada and get sight of Valdelecl #237;n, an old morisco that came with me spoke this badly composed words:  #171;If want you, alfaqui, stop here little little and me tell you thing big that boy king and mother his do here #187;* From here on, Guevara tells, in good Spanish prose, the story of the moor's sigh. The words normally put on Aixa's mouth, however, differ in Guevara's account from the usual formulation one normally sees in Spanish. I transcribe and then translate: *Justa cosa es que el rey y los caballeros lloren como mugeres, pues no pelearon como caballeros* **Translation**: *Fair thing it is that the King and his knights shall cry like women, for they did not fight like knights.* Then Fray Antonio de Guevara adds a comment he puts in the old morisco's mouth: *Many times I heard the boy king, my lord, say that had he known what his mother would later say about him and his knights, they would have killed eachother or turned back to Granada to fight.* This comment pretending to give credibility to the story, somehow destroys it entirely. This old morisco, allegedly says that he spoke many times with Boabdil after that fact, which means that he would have accompanied him to exile, and then come back to Spain. We know Boabdil was exiled in 1493, and that is when the story should have happened. He went to exile with his family and only a few close courtiers. The courtiers in Granada would have spoken Spanish more than reasonably well, like Yusuf ibn Kumasa, Abrahem al Cayci, or Abrahem el Pequeni, as they would serve both as court officers and occasionally as diplomats, having to speak mostly to the Kings of Castile. Pretending that a courtier would speak such a dreadful Spanish as shown at the beginning of the story is not credible. The story is good, and it ends with an aesop about knighthood, so we can place it in the same category as fables or exempla, a genre well known in Spanish literature through El conde Lucanor, by Don Juan Manuel, prince of Villena.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I will briefly explain the technical part of the ring, and why it points towards it belonging to either an emperor or someone from the imperial family. That ring nowadays is expensive, but in the first century would have been ludicrously, comically, unfathomably expensive. Bear with me with the technical part. Carving that without the stone exploding is hell, and that is with modern crystalographic machinery that a top jeweller would have: diamond-point instruments, high-end optics, abrasion lathes, the lot. In order to make that ring, you first need to have a substantially large sapphire, with a substantial purity. Even though it is counterintuitive, manually carving a big stone is much more difficult than carving a small one, because there are more chances of finding an impurity, or a deformation in the crystal structure. Stones this hard (a sapphire is a fancy topaz, and that is very high on Mohs scale) are cut by percussion: you give the stone a precise wack, and pray to your favourite deity for the stone to fracture following the crystallisation line you had noticed and not other. If there is any distortion like an impurity or a crystallisation oddity, tough luck, the stone broke to pieces. This one "Caligula ring" must have received some 8-9 wacks in order to get into that shape, and one can be positively sure that it was not the first try, sapphires are very tricky. So, someone must have given the jeweller no fewer than three sapphires of substantial size, and the money for the improbous work. That is something that was within the economic possibilities of very few people. If not Caligula, then the ring must have belonged to someone in the imperial family</TEXT>

    <TEXT>There are some exceptions of course, like Christopher Columbus. He was a good swimmer and managed to survive his ship being sunk in 1476. He swam for a while until he reached a plank, and then with the plank's help he managed to get ashore. Another good swimmer, mentioned by Gonzalo Fern #225;ndez de Oviedo in his General and Natural History of the Indies, was the Italian Matteo della Rocca. This guy was fishing one day in the coast of Panama, caught a massive manta-ray, but the animal dragged him to the sea, with the bad luck of the fishing line trapping one of his legs. He managed to fight back, cut the line, stab the ray, and get it to his boat. Oviedo says the fight with the ray lasted for an hour, but one has to assume that under such stress, time must have seemed longer to Matteo.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Not much more to add, really. In 1485 Columbus was not only rejected by the king of Portugal, but also became a widower. Tough year for him. With his project rejected and being alone in this world with 2 or 3 year old baby, he did what was the most reasonable thing: he tried to have some help from relatives. For this purpose, Christopher Columbus went to Huelva, in the South of Spain, where his sister-in-law Briolanja Moniz was living, and at that point she was relatively well-off. In the period 1485-1487, Columbus was in Huelva, alongside Briolanja Moniz and Miguel Muliart (Moliaert?), taking care of his very young boy, and frequently confiding with the friars in the monastery of La R #225;bida, which is outside Palos, not far from Huelva. In that monastery there was a certain Fray Juan P #233;rez, renowned in astronomy, and very influential as a priest in the region. We also should not forget that in Palos lived Pedro V #225;zquez (also known as Pedro Velasco), an old seafarer who had sailed under the king of Portugal's banner in 1452, taking part in the discovery of the island of Flores. If we want solid proof about Columbus in Spain, besides literary evidence, which can be tenuous in more than one case), then the records would start in 1487, when we have Columbus appearing in some payments of the Contadur #237;a Mayor de Cuentas, the first one being from may the 5th 1487. I transcribe and translate: *Este dicho dia (5 de Mayo 1487) di  #225; Xpoual de Colomo extranjero tres mill mrs. que est #225; aqu #237; hasiendo algunas cosas conplideras  #225; servicio de sus altezas por c #233;dula de Alonso de Quintanilla con mandamiento del Obispo* **Translation**: The aforementioned day (May the 5th 1487), I gave to Xpoval de Colomo, foreigner, three thousand maravedis, for he is doing some things that have to be done in Their Highnesses' service, by charter from Alonso de Quintanilla, and on the Bishop's order. This gives credit to Gonzalo Fern #225;ndez de Oviedo's information on Columbus, as he said that the future admiral was introduced to the Court by the mediation and protection of Alonso de Quintanilla. The road that lead Columbus to being acquainted to Quintanilla was arduous, and one can say that he was lucky in meeting the right people at the right time. When he arrived to the firth of Huelva, he decided to stop by at the monastery that was close to Palos, so that he and his baby could have something to eat or drink. There he found friar Antonio de Marchena, the astronomer, who was only there on an official visit, being some sort of supervisor general for the Franciscan order in Andalusia. Thanks to Marchena, he got to Juan P #233;rez, and with this two friars' assistance, he got in contact with the duke of Medinaceli, who would remain Columbus' friend for the rest of his life. With Medinaceli, Marchena, and P #233;rez, he met Alonso Quintanilla, and that got him to the Royal Court. So, while we cannot attest Columbus activities in an incontrovertible manner in the 1485-1487 period, we have strong reasons to ascertain that he was in Huelva, and later on in Seville. As for the tomb of Innocent VIII, it is entirely irrelevant. The funerary monument is from 1621, when the tomb was transferred to its current location by Alberico Cybo-Malaspina, great-nephew of Innocent VIII. The "suo aevo inventi gloria" is nothing but a mistake or a voluntary glorification of his own lineage: Columbus set sail on August 3rd 1492 at 8 in the morning, while Innocent VIII had died a month earlier. Considering that on the funerary monument it is also said that Innocent gave Isabella and Ferdinand the title of Catholic Monarchs, something actually done by Alexander VI a couple of years after Innocent's death, we can entirely dismiss the monument as evidence of anything other than the titles that Alberico Cybo-Malaspina held.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>As for the reliability of Piri Reis, I have to add that is cartographically reliable as for what the earliest chart made by Columbus would have looked like. Let me explain: Piri Reis claims that his uncle, the late Gazi Kemal Reis, had a Spanish slave. This slave, according to admiral Piri had been to the Indies with Columbus more than once, which is feasible. Piri goes on to say that this man had a navigation chart of the Indies, based on Columbus' own. This, again, is absolutely plausible, and I will elaborate a tiny bit more. In the year 1501 Columbus was out of favour with the Court, and he was in Andalusia. Angelo Trevisan, secretary to the Venetian ambassador became a good friend of his, and through him commissioned a navigational chart of the Indies. Trevisan, in his letter to Domenico Malipiero, says "bisogener #224; tardar qualche zorno perch #233; Palos, dove la se fa,  #232; lutano de qua 200 milia. Palos  #232; un villazo dove non havitano salvo che marinari et homini pratichi di quel viazo del Columbo. E lo mandata far dal compasso grande perch #233; la sia pi #249; bella". Translation: It will take a few days because Palos, where it is made is 200 miles from here. Palos is a village where there is nobody except sailors and experienced men from that voyage of Columbus. And I have commissioned it of a big compass so that it shall be more beautiful". This paragraph makes it clear that navigation charts of the Indies could be procured in 1500 in Palos without much problems, which makes it possible for a Spanish sailor captured by a Turkish pirate to have had one of those maps. The elements present in Piri's map make it clear that he had a map closely linked to Columbus' own cartography: Zipango is north of Hispaniola, Cuba is shown as part of a continental mass and not an island, etc. So, in Piri Reis' map we can see elements from Christopher Columbus' own maps, making his story about Gazi Kemal having a copy of one of Columbus' maps obtained during a raid on the Spanish coast.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>As for the financing of Columbus' expedition, we have detailed accounts to nearly the last maraved #237;. Let me explain the mechanics of it all: Luis de Sant #225;ngel, chief accountant of Arag #243;n, anticipated 1,140,000 maraved #237;s from the treasury of the Holy Brotherhood (think of it as the Guardia Civil or the Carabinieri) on May the 2nd 1492. Come May the 5th of 1492, and he receives a document from Hernando de Talavera allowing Sant #225;ngel to be reimbursed from the treasury of the Bull of the Holy Crusade of the Bishopric of Badajoz. Sant #225;ngel gets his money back a few days later. Columbus raised another 500,000 maraved #237;s from Mart #237;n Alonso Pinz #243;n, Vicente Y #225; #241;ez Pinz #243;n, and Francisco Mart #237;n Pinz #243;n. Yes, the famous Pinz #243;n brothers. He also borrowed some extra capital from Italian financers in Seville: 180,000 maraved #237;s from Giannotto Berardi (as declared in his last will, where mentions that Columbus owes him that amount), and some other amount along the lines of 300,000 maraved #237;s from the Genovese banker Francesco Pinelli. Total cost of the expedition: around 2,000,000 maraved #237;s disimbursed by Luis de Sant #225;ngel, Giannotto Berardi, Francesco Pinelli, and the Pinz #243;n brothers.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>There were many factors involved, and Sir Francis Drake was only one of them. First, we need to consider the nature of the Spanish Armada. It was a transport convoy that was supposed to get to the coast of Flanders, get Farnese's soldiers on the ships, and disembark them on the English coast. So, it was mostly composed of transport ships and armed merchant ships fitted for transport. The Spanish command, and the disagreements within it were another factor in the failure of the Armada. The commander of the fleet would have been  #193;lvaro de Baz #225;n, first marquess of Santa Cruz, but he died before the expedition set sail. The command was subsequently given to the Duke of Medina Sidonia, a man who got sea-sick at any given moment. Giving him the command made sense though, as he was one of the most reputed experts in logistics in Spain, and this operation was about transporting troops. Had it been a war fleet, command would have probably gone to Rekalde, a basque captain of good name and great experience. When the Spanish fleet was traversing the English Channel, he noticed the English fleet at anchor and the Spanish fleet with the wind in favour, so he proposed a swift attack in order to destroy the English fleet at anchor and then go to Flanders in safety. Medina Sidonia, using his commanding prerogatives, ignored Rekalde's suggestion, and decided the best course of action would be sticking to the plan and sailing towards Flanders. When the winds and the situation changed, his fleet was easily attacked by the Englished fleet, causing some damage. The artillery the Spanish ships were packing, according to Diego de Prado y Tovar, who supervised the artillery alongside captain general Juan de Acu #241;a Vela, was few and of an inadequate nature, but their suggestions were ignored in order to save time. When the fight came, the Spanish artillery could hardly hit the English ships, according to his testimony in his Pl #225;tica Manual de Artiller #237;a from 1591. The lack of coordination with Alessandro Farnese lead to the bulk of the Spanish troops not being embarked, and the Armada opting for circumnavigating the British Isles and going back to Spain. This proved fatal, with many ships capsizing by the Scottish and the Irish coast, most notably the latter. These wreckages caused heavier losses than Drake's own intervention in the English channel. In total, Spain lost 63 ships out of the 154 that had set sail. Of these, only 7 were lost in the English channel, and of those 7 only two were lost in combat. So, to answer the question, Drake was one of the many factors, and definitely not the biggest one.</TEXT>

Bear in mind that by 1578 the viceroyalty of New Spain was already heavily hispanicised, at least administratively: by 1555 there was a viceroy, a Royal Audience of Justice, a Royal Mint, a University, hospitals, barracks, etc. The soldiers would have worn the usual arms and armour one sees amongst the Spanish troops, even if part of the troops were of native origin. As for the Incan and Mayan troops, I have my own reservations against that. There were indeed native american men amongst the Spanish garrisons and units in the viceroyalty of New Spain, but having Peruvians up there is just beyond the realm of plausibility. Mayans, I also doubt it. The Mayan area was not fully conquered until the late 17th century, and the accesibility was very complicated, that's why it took so long to pacify and secure the control of the zone. The possibility of the Captain General of Mexico recruiting troops in the Yucat #225;n is a rather unfeasible idea. The native american troops within the Spanish army would have likely been from the area of the Valley of Anahuac, so mexicans, tlaxcalans, and possibly some tarascans, though they are not from that valley.

    <TEXT>Christopher Columbus organised four voyages into the New World. The first, in 1492, is by far the most famous. After this travel, he went to back to Spain to report on the voyage. He arrived to Lisbon, where he stayed and conversed with the King of Portugal, until his crew became angry, wanting to get back home, so eventually he went back to Palos. Afterwards, he went to Seville, where he remained for a short time, until he received a letter from the Catholic Monarchs ordering him to go to the Royal Court and report on his voyage. He arrived in Barcelona in the second half of April 1493, where he informed the Monarchs on what he saw. We don't know the details of this interview, but we can infer he was asked about the lands and whether he had made to the Indies, and Columbus' answer must have been something along the lines of "I don't have a clue". This lead to the immediate organisation of a second voyage, with an armada of 17 ships and 1,500 men. This second voyage set sail from C #225;diz in the second half of 1493. A third voyage, in 1498, was also organised by Columbus. He settled in Santo Domingo, acting in his capacity of Viceroy, Governor, and Captain General. His mismanagement, corruption, and brutality towards the Spanish settlers and the natives lead to the Crown sending a pesquisidor (attorney), who investigated the charges and brought Columbus back to Spain in chains. Bobadilla's inquiry resulted in Columbus being stripped of his ranks and titles, which caused Columbus to fall into bad economic shape, living off his wealthy mecenae, until he could reclaim his titles. His fourth journey, this time under the Crown's orders and supervised by Juan Rodr #237;guez de Fonseca Ulloa, was in 1502. After that, he remained in Spain, trying to fight the Crown for his titles and privileges, while helped by his mecenae and the Italian colony in Seville, more particularly his fellow Genovese people like Bartolomeo Fieschi, Franco Cattaneo, Francesco da Rivarola, and the Genovese ambassador. In his final days he was in Valladolid, only accosted by his close friend Fieschi and some friars. He died there, on May the 20th 1506, being buried in the calasostra of Saint Francis' convent, under the patronage of the Duke of Medinaceli. He died in relative poverty, but he had the good taste of settling, in his last will, his old debts with Genovese people like Benedetto da Porto, Paolo de Negro, Lodisio Centurione Scotto, Nicol #242; Spinola di Luccoli di Ronco, and a couple other people. His descendants managed to defeat the Crown in a very long series of lawsuits based on the concept of the Chapters of Santa Fe not being a Crown mercy but a contract, meaning the Crown could not unilaterally annul it without incurring in heavy penalties. Edit: Forgot one thing. Columbus did participate in the slave trade. He sent 1,600 natives to Spain, of which 1,200 made it to their destination. This resulted in Columbus being condemned by the Crown to recover all of those people and bring them back to their lands at Columbus' expenses, as he was violating Queen Isabella's orders concerning the natives not being enslaved as they were vassals of the Crown of Castile. Not all of them were recovered, and it was rather notorious that amongst the great houses of Castile there were native American slaves. These slaves did not live long due to the rigours of the Spanish climate (especially in the Northern half of Spain), and the European sicknesses to which they were not immune.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>The dog is actually a classic symbol of loyalty, as it is very well known that dogs are extremely loyal to their owners, however this is not the sole explanation for it. The Museo del Prado was created from the Royal Collection of the Kings of Spain, who were big mecenae, patrons of the arts. Both the Habsburgs and the Bourbons employed different Court painters to paint pictures of the family, and also of individuals of the royal family as individual portraits. Vel #225;zquez, for example, was not only the Court painter, but also a good friend of King Philip IV, which resulted in a number of paintings of a not so royal style, but more of a natural attitude. King Philip IV was an avid hunter, as many members of his family before and after him. Hunting was an activity linked to royalty and nobility since time immemorial, as can be attested by other works of art like the [sepulchre of Fern #225;n de Andrade the Good,](https://www.artnaturagalicia.com/files/artnatura/full/2018/02/PEREZANDRADE.jpg) in the church of Saint Francis in Betanzos (Galicia), that rests on top of two massive figures, one being a female bear, and the other one a female boar. Charles V was also a big fan of hunting, and in one of his portraits you can see him [accompanied by one of his dogs](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/7/7a/Vecellio_di_Gregorio_Tiziano_-_L%27imperatore_Carlo_V_con_un_cane.jpg). Philip II, son of Charles V, enjoyed hunting too. In fact, one of the reasons for choosing Madrid as the place for the Court was that it is close to the royal mount of El Pardo, abundant in game, so the king could go hunting without being far away from the Court. There is even a [painting of Giovanni Andrea Doria](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/5/5b/Giovanniandrea_doria.jpg), grand-nephew of Andrea Doria, with the dog Hercules, that had been a gift from Philip II. [Philip IV](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/b/b8/Diego_Rodr%C3%ADguez_Vel%C3%A1zquez_-_Felipe_IV%2C_cazador_%28Prado%2C_Madrid%29.jpg), the cardinal-Infante [Ferdinand of Austria](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/5/51/Diego_Vel%C3%A1zquez_-_Retrato_del_Cardinal-Infante_Fernando_de_Austria.jpg), King [Charles III](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/c/c0/Carlos_III_cazador.jpg/1200px-Carlos_III_cazador.jpg) , prince [Baltasar Carlos](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/9/9a/Diego_Vel%C3%A1zquez_054.jpg), have all been painted in hunting attire at different points, and of course accompanied by their trusted hunting dogs, a very necessary tool for hunting. So, the dogs that you see in paintings were actual dogs, loyal companions to the Kings, that not only represented loyalty, but also royalty and wealth, for maintaining a hunting dog, or a pack of hunting dogs, was expensive. Of course you may have also seen mythological scenes in there, like the death of Acteon, and that requires, by its own nature, the presence of several hunting dogs.  #8203; Edit: Added links to the images of the paintings I mentioned</TEXT>

    <TEXT>This is an extremely vapourous question, as it goes to the fundamental concepts of historical continuity and what is a country, that's why it is so difficult to answer. The short answer would be that Catalonia has never been an independent country, but that would require a number of asterisks here and there. Starting from the beginning, the denomination of Catalonia, and of the Catalan people only emerges in the late 12th century. Would it be correct to apply the term to the realities that were in that region prior to that? Only in the geographic sense, and by that I mean in order for the modern reader to understand the situation better. Let's jump a bit farther back in time, to the 10th century. In the late 9th and 10th centuries, part of the territory that nowadays corresponds to modern Catalonia was part of the Frankish Empire, and of the Frankish Kingdom, it was a region called Marca Hispanica, a frontier territory governed by a marquess in the name of the Frankish kings. The position was not hereditary originally, but eventually dynasties arose, and the Bellonids became the hereditary counts of Ausona, Gerona, Barcelona, and a number of places. They were still vassals to the Frankish Kings, but governed with a lot of independence, as they were far from the Court, and separated from the Frankish realm by a big mountainous chain, the Pyrenees. Come the year 985, and Al-Mansur, visir to the Caliph of Cordova, attacks Barcelona, sacks it, and pillages the rest of the territory in modern day Catalonia. The count of Barcelona, screwed as he was, asked his liege for help, the help that he was due. Help never arrived. Three years later, the new Frankish king called his vassals to pledge fealty to him, and that included the count of Barcelona, who did not show up: if the kings of the Franks do not fulfill their duty of protection, then there is no point in being his vassal. From that point onwards, we can start talking about an independent county of Barcelona, which at that time would be some 1/2 of present day Catalonia. This is, however, still a matter of feudalism, and at a point where "Catalonia" was not even a thing. If we jump forward in time, to the year 1137, we have a King of Aragon in big trouble, so he promises his daughter in marriage to the Count of Barcelona, who then becomes "dominator" of Aragon. Should the King's daughter die without having provided an heir, then the Count of Barcelona would take over and be the rightful ruler of Aragon, for him and for his successors. They were happily married, and succession was not a problem. From the year 1137, the county of Barcelona was integrated into the Crown of Aragon, or "patrimony of the King of Aragon", but functioned differently: they had their own privileges, laws, customs, coinage, you name it. In the 14th century things get much clearer and better codified, and we start to have some political sense of the Principality of Catalonia, which was one of the consituent realms of the Crown of Aragon (think of it as the United Kingdom, if you wish). Come the late 15th century, Isabel of Castile and Ferdinand of Aragon get happily married, and from then onwards we have a personal union between the crowns of Castile and Aragon: id est, the same person in King of Castile and King of Aragon, but the king of Castile and the king Aragon are two different offices. It's even more complex than that, considering that culturally speaking all the peoples of both realms were spaniards, and there was a certain unity, though not a political one. It's really complex. I'll leave this comment at this length, and elaborate further on the matter of the Catalan Insurrection of 1640, which deserves some particularisation, as it is one of the main national myths of Catalonia.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Back in the saddle, so let's talk about the Reapers' War, also known as the Catalan uprising, but with some precedent first. Willing to strengthen the Empire's military in order to be able to cope with the many wars, the Count-Duke of Olivares proposed the Uni #243;n de Arms (Union of Arms), a system under which all of the territories under Philip IV's authority would contribute to the war efforts according to their respective population and wealth. This would have meant having an army of 140,000 men, which should just about suffice for all of the troubles. The whole idea was entirely rejected by the parliaments of the Crown of Aragon, not willing to compromise men or wealth for the wars, which lead to a lot of discontent, best summarised by Quevedo's verses: *En Navarra y Arag #243;n no hay quien tribute un real*; *Catalu #241;a y Portugal son de la misma opini #243;n; s #243;lo Castilla y Le #243;n y el noble pueblo andaluz llevan a cuestas la cruz.* (In Navarre or Aragon, none contributes a real, Catalonia and Portugal are of the same opinion; only Castille and Leon, and the noble Andalusian folk, carry on their shoulders the brunt). Come the year of 1635, and Catalonia finds the Union of Arms right at home. In 1639, the French armies invade the Roussillon. Naturally, the King asks the Catalan parliament to raise an army at once, and levy some taxes in order to finance it, as it would be the fastest course of action until a substantial army can come into play. The Catalan parliament rejected the idea, which resulted in an exasperated outburst by Olivares: *Catalonia is a province that there is no King in the world that has one like it. If the enemies attack it, its King shall defend it without them contributing their part, nor exposing their people to any perils. He must bring the army from outside, has to maintain it, recover the lost places, and this army, not with the enemies expelled or before their expulsion can camp, or, nor shall the province lodge it... One has to look whether the constitutions say this, the customs say that, when this is about the supreme law: the survival of the province.* The army being discontent with all this, getting paid late, not being able to camp, it turned to pillage and extortions, which only made matters worse, creating popular outrage. Come the month of May of 1640, and rebellion erupts: the viceroy, Count of Santa Coloma, is murdered, the rebels control Barcelona. Pau Claris, first deputy of the Deputation of the General, proclaims the Catalan Republic. He manages to secure the support of France, and in September of that same year a pact is signed with France: Catalonia shall be a republic under the tutelage of France. The war, by the end of the year was going badly for the Catalans, with the royal army of Philip IV taking Cambrils, Tarragona, and Martorell. The bad situation made the Catalan authorities cave in to the French demands, and on January 23rd of 1641 they swore Louis XIV of France as Count of Barcelona, turning Catalonia into a French territory. With Spain involved heavily in the War of the Thirty Years, the Reapers' War between France and Spain lasted for a long time, with different moments of back and forth. After the Peace of Westphalia, France lost interest in the matters of Catalonia, which allowed for a solid advance of the Spanish armies. In 1651, the armies of Philip IV under the command of his bastard son Juan Jos #233; de Austria besiege Barcelona, and conquer it in 1652. The Catalan authorities swear Philip IV as Count of Barcelona. France, however, keeps controlling the Roussillon, a matter that would be settled in the Treaty of the Pyrenees, where Spain ceded the county of Roussillon to France. So, in the second half of the year 1640, Catalonia was a Republic under the tutelage of the King of France, which is as close to independence as Catalonia has ever been. Important note: the Catalan parliament (les Corts) was not a democratic institution, it was feudal in its very nature, composed of members of three branche, called arms: the ecclesiastical arm, the military arm, and the royal arm. These Corts had a permanent deputation called Diputaci #243; del General (the Deputation of the General) that managed the collection of the General capitation tax when the parliament was not in session. Its "first deputy" or "resident deputy" was the seniormost (by rank) member of the ecclesiastic arm as a matter of protocol, recognising the primacy of the Church.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>In Spain we have one such example in the Late Middle Ages: Hernando de Zafra. In this case, Zafra is a geophraphic indication rather than a surname. Hernando de Zafra was born in Zafra, in Extremadura, "of plebeian parents" according to Gonzalo Fern #225;ndez de Oviedo, who had the occasion to befriend the man. His parents were peasants, but probably relatively well-off. Zafra studied Law at the University of Salamanca, as being a jurist was a good way of climbing the social ladder. He studied thanks to a scholarship, and soon his intelligence caught the attention of some of the higher-ups, which landed him a job. His continued good service and ability to understand the Laws and torture them got him in the good graces of the Monarchs, who appointed Zafra as one of the royal secretaries. With this office, Zafra served as secretary, which meant acting as occasional diplomat as well, and made a fortune. He actively participated in the negotiations for the surrender of Granada, and latter negotiated with Abrahen el Cay #231;i and Yusuf ibn Kumasa the sale of Boabdil's lordships. This negotiations, along with some others in the grayest areas of the Law made him exceedingly wealthy, and earned him a lordship, and also being married to a woman of the house of Ayala, one of the oldest and most prestigious ones in Castile. His palace in Granada still stands today.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>The burning of people was not a common ocurrence, and the Spanish Inquisition had a surprisingly low convction rate, due in part to the procedural guarantees. The auto de fe was nothing but the spectacular final part of a very long judiciary procedure, and it was meant to be something public and impressive in order to instill fear into the hearts and minds of the heretics or apostates. Let's skip the judiciary part, which can be rather ordinary, with attorneys, lawyers, evidence, witnesses, the whole lot, and get into what an auto de fe was like. Fernando de Vald #233;s Salas, General Inquisitor, establishes this in the Instructions for the Inquisition: *Concluded all the procedures and the sentences having been dictated, the Inquisitors shall choose a holy day for the celebration of the auto de fe. The date will be notified to the priests, and to the municipal autorities, and in case there are, to the president and auditors of the Court of Justice, to invite them to the ceremony. The inquisitors will make sure the auto does not start too late so the execution of the sentenced people can be carried out in day light and without incidents.* Here we can see the relevance that publicity had, and the fact that it took a long time, that's why it should not start late. In a time prior to artificial lighting, it was important that public ceremonies were visible. The preparation of the auto took a really long time, and because of that, it was a rather exceptional ocurrence, think of the logistics as something akin to a concert, but with fewer and worse means: the sambenitos, processional robes that the sentenced people wore to the gallows, needed to be made for each individual, and they were rather complex in design. These sambenitos were not burnt along the heretics, but hung in the parish to which the heretic had been ascribed, so everyone would be able to see them in the years to come, and the families of the heretics were publicly known, as they were barred from holding public office (see the Statutes of Blood Cleanliness by Cardinal Sil #237;ceo). The gallows had to be built ad hoc in the main square or in the close vicinity of the parish, as well as the stands for the audience. This requires some preparation and a lot of carpentry. In case one of the heretics had fled or died prior to the auto de fe, effigies (banners) had to be made so they would be executed in effigy. A few days before the show, the town criers would announce the auto de fe, indicating the date, time, and place where it would happen, so the people would go see it. The day before the auto de fe, the show starts with the "procession of the Green Cross". The green cross was a symbol of the Inquisition, along with the sword and the palm (quick side note here: in Spain there are many "plazas de la Cruz Verde" or squares of the green cross, named that way as the Inquisition was there). At two in the afternoon, the civil authorities, alongside the religious authorities would march in solemn procession carrying the green cross that would preside the auto. The day of the auto, at dawn, the white cross procession would start. The procession was led by the public minister carrying a cross with some of the wood that would be used. Behind him, the clergy, then the effigies, then the reconciliados carrying large candles (reconciliados are those who had come back to the Church, abjurating their ideas, "de levi" or "de vehementi"), and the last ones were the people that would be burnt. When the procession made it to the square, the authorities would go to their places in the stands to watch the show. With everyone in place, the show starts. First, a reputable and qualified preacher would pronounce a sermon defending the one true faith and condemning the heresies and the heretics. Then, the preacher would ask the unrepentant heretics to abjurate their heresies before they died. If they did, they were not burnt alive, but got strangled prior to being burnt. Concluded the sermon, the individual sentences were read, with each sentenced person having to step forward. The reconciliados would then and there abjurate the heresies publicly, and swear not to commit the same errors again. With this part finished, religious hymns were sung, most notably the miserere me (God have mercy on me). This business finished, the burning of heretics finally arrives, but this is not the end. The reconciliados normally had pecuniary penalties and some sort of public penitence, which was carried out on the next day. As I have said, autos de fe were a very rare thing, for they were incredibly costly (gallows, wood, sambenitos, salaries for al the workers...). The most famous autos de fe happened in the year 1559 in Valladolid and Seville. In those autos two very prominent protestant circles were eliminated, the group lead by doctor Agust #237;n de Cazalla in Valladolid, and the group lead by Constantino Ponce de la Fuente in Seville. Ponce de la Fuente had been one of the Emperor's preachers and had worked as a censor for the Inquisition in Triana, that's why this auto was so prominent. In order to avoid these costly kerfuffles, the Inquisition always tried to get abjurations and reconciliations, with the imposition of monetary penalties, as cash was not always in excess in the Inquisition's coffers.

    <TEXT>As far as I have read, autos de fe always involved burnings, be it in effigy or in person. It was monstruously costly, and only happened for really big occasions like entire lutheran groups being busted. Reconciliation with the Church was always the desirable outcome of a judiciary process, but it did not always happen. The auto de fe of Valladolid was particularly famous due to the prominence and wealth of the members of the lutheran circle lead by Cazalla, including several aristocrats and basically the whole Vivero family. If it does not ring a bell, the Catholic Monarchs were married in the Vivero palace of Valladolid.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>This question may be more suited for a legal kind of subreddit. I'm going to give my two cents about this, despite not being a historian of the law, but having read enough old legislation. That sub-clause within the first point of the 14th Amendment is there thinking of one specific kind of people: diplomats. Sons and daughters of foreign diplomats may be born in the United States, but their parents are not subject to the United States jurisdiction due to the usual diplomatic privileges. This is just about the exception to the fourteenth amendment, and it is a rather odd one. The diplomats being excepted, the rest of the people born in the United States of America are subject to American jurisdiction: the law applies to the land, not to the people. I am a Spanish citizen, and if I commit a crime in the USA, I am not subject to the consequences foreseen in the Spanish Penal Code, but rather to the criminal laws of the USA. Of course, as I have pointed out, there is the particular exception of diplomats due to the nature of the privileges and immunities granted by the international diplomatic conventions. Let us also remember one thing about these conventions: US Embassies, consular legations, or other diplomatic legations are not part of the USA. They are still part of the country where they stand, but subject to some general privileges of extraterritoriality. So, if a foreigner would give birth to a son or daughter within the premises of an American embassy, that son or daughter would not be automatically eligible for citizenship. This is the gist of the matter, and the opinion of Eric Foner, a historian specialised in American political history, and also of Garrett Epps, professor of Constitutional Law. Kamala Harris was born in the United States, and as far as I know she was not the daughter of a foreign diplomat, which means she was born in the USA and subject to its jurisdiction.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>That's quite a complex question. The concept of Autonomous Regions comes from the 1978 constitution, as you have noticed, but it does have a precedent in the II Republic. In that period, there were three regions (Galicia, Basque Country, Catalonia) that obtained Statutes of Autonomy, based on the fact that they had their own languages and that they were "historical nations" (whatever that means). Fast-forward to Franco, and the Statutes of Autonomy fly out the window: Spain becomes a unitary state, with no regional autonomy, no free elections, etc. When Franco died, king Juan Carlos, prime minister Adolfo Su #225;rez, and the one and only Torcuato Fern #225;ndez-Miranda get to work in restoring democracy, but without ruptures. In Torcuato's own words: from the Law to the Law, through the Law. Amongst the things that got restored prior to the approval of the Constitution were the autonomies of Catalonia, Basque Country, and Galicia, as that was of paramount importance. That was not only a symbol of democratisation, but also of reconciliation: Josep Tarradellas, who had been appointed in exile as president of the Generalitat, came back to Spain, and saw the Generalitat legally restored. This would help in getting the Catalanists' support for the Constitution. That still does not explain the Autonomous Communities, so let me go back to the Constitution itself, article 2: *The Constitution is fundamented in the indissoluble unity of the Spanish Nation, common and indivisible motherland of all the Spanish people, and recognises and guarantees the right to autonomy of the nationalities and regions that compose it, and the solidarity amongst them.* As you may have noticed, the concept of autonomous communities does not even exist there, what we see are nationalities and regions. Prior to the Constitution, Spain was a heavily centralised state, only administratively divided into regions, that's why the term "regions" can be seen in the 2nd article. Galicia, Catalonia, and Basque Country had the consideration of "nationalities" according to some yet to be defined idea emanating from the Statutes of Autonomy they had during the II Republic. The first version of the Constitution, usually called Gades constitution, as the draft was created in the Gades restaurant, had this concept of a two tier system, similar to Italy, where there are regions with an ordinary statute, and regions with autonomy (Sardinia, Sicily, Trentino-Alto Adige, Valle d'Aosta, and Friuli-Venezia Giulia). You can see this concept in article 2 of the Spanish Constitution. With the Constitution, we have what is called "Estado de las Autonom #237;as", the State of the Autonomies, wherein the State has devolved just about all of the powers to the autonomous communities, except for Defense, Foreign Affairs, infrastructures that go through more than one community, and not much else. This devolution of powers has resulted in what we call "taifas", paying homage to the 11th through 13th centuries, where the different unitary muslim states eventually crumbled to pieces and Al-Andalus ended up being a collection of mini-kingdoms. Spain keeps a relatively strong cohesion, and I will incide on the relative. Most of the people feel Spanish, or Spanish + regional identity. The problem comes from different sides. Franco incided an awful lot on the Spanish identity, in detriment of the regional identities, which resulted in the leftist parties reneging from any hint of Spanish nationalism, or even Spanish patriotism, and will embrace any anti-Spanish proposals from the peripheral nationalism. The logic for this is simple: Franco was very nationalist, Spanish nationalist. So, the only altrernative for the left to be leftist is being anti-Spanish. The system Spain has now is quasi-federal, or federal in all but name. There is even a term for that: asymmetric federalism. Which means that it is federal, but not all the regions are equal. Some autonomies have more devolved matters, the Basque Country and Navarre have a special economic agreement, etc. What stops the regions from breaking away? Articles 2, 8, 155, and 116 of the Spanish constitution, mostly. The only time that article 155 (federal coercion mechanism) has been used was in 2017 when the independentist majority of the Catalan parliament staged the fake referendum and declared independence (kinda sorta maybe). Also, let's not forget that the independentists, though majority in the regional parliament, are in the social minority, having never surpassed the 50% of the votes landmark.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I entirely forgot to mention a couple of things. The concept of "autonomous communities" does appear in the Constitution. Article 2 is just an evidence of a first writing that was not corrected on a second writing. When Catalonia, Galicia, and the Basque Country obtained autonomy, massive demosnstrations happened in Andaluc #237;a asking for a statute of autonomy as well. Stemming from this came the famous "caf #233; para todos" (coffee for all), and all the regions would become autonomius communities.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>When it comes to weapons, everything is a trade-off: if you add more weight, the impact force will be higher, but you lose on nimbleness and control. A mace can be really effective against a heavily armoured opponent but it is very forward heavy, so you cannot control it as well as you would control a sword. In this regard, extremely sharp weapons will lose on the durability side. One of the main weapons of Aztec troops was the macuahuitl, which is, broadly speaking, a wooden plank lined with obsidian chunks attached to it with resin. Obsidian knives or blades are scarily sharp, and can be sharper than steel blades, but here we come to the trade-offs. Obsidian is basically glass, and broken or chipped pieces of glass are mighty sharp, everyone knows that. However, glass is very brittle. Hit a plate armour, and the obsidian will shatter to pieces. Hit some unprotected area, and it will cut phenomenally well (some Spanish sources like Bernal D #237;az or L #243;pez de G #243;mara claim these obsidian "swords" could decapitate a horse in one strike). Plate armour, made of good tempered steel will resist the impacts of obsidian blades without any problems. However, in the rigours of the tropical climate in Mexico it can be a liabilty due to the heat, causing its wearer to tire and sweat. This is one of the reasons why conquistadors would resort to using just gambeson, a type of armour made of several layers of linen or cotton that would normally be worn under the armour for padding and extra protection. Gambeson is not much different in its nature to the cotton cuirasses the Aztecs used. Just by the sheer number of layers (around 10), it gives some good protection against swords or arrows. Claiming that steel plate, gambeson, swords, lances, and crossbows are inferior to obsidian weapons, cotton armour, and obsidian pointed arrows is rather preposterous.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>In Spain we have an example from the late 19th century: king Alfonso XIII. His father, king Alfonso XII, died at a young age due to tuberculosis, but his wife was pregnant at the moment. When Alfonso XII died, queen Mar #237;a Cristina became regent until the child would be born, and if the child survived, until it came of age. In case there had been a miscarriage, or the child was stillborn, she would have been queen regent until the rightful heir could swear his office before the Parliament* * The rightful heir would have been princess Mar #237;a de las Mercedes, elder sister of the then-to-be-born Alfonso XIII. When their father died, she was 5 years old, so the regency would have lasted 11 years, as the Constitution of 1876 established the king or queen to be of age at 16 years old.</TEXT>

He took it upon his shoulders to be the Pliny of the New World, studying all the species he could find, and of course he made culinary remarks on most of them: armadillos, manatees, iguanas, capybaras, jut #237;as, alligators, the whole lot. I wrote an article a couple of months ago for an online divulgative magazine compiling ten of the species with Oviedo's gastronomic comments, which I link (it is in Spanish). https://elretohistorico.com/gonzalo-fernandez-de-oviedo-el-primer-critico-gastronomico-de-america/</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Welcome to Spain in the 16th century, and we go to the Imperial City of Toledo. In the year 1547, the archbishop of Toledo, primate of the Spains, is cardinal Juan Mart #237;nez Guijarro (also known as Sil #237;ceo because it's fancier), and he creates the Estatutos de Limpieza de Sangre, in English "Statutes of Blood Cleanliness", barring from office anyone who was jewish, muslim, protestant, or who had an ancestor falling under any of those categories within the last four generations. This created a lot of problems, as many "homines novi" and civil servants could not prove any of this, giving way to a shortage in civil servants due to vacancies. Someone ought to do something, and that someone was none other than Pedro Fern #225;ndez de Velasco, duke of Fr #237;as and count of Haro. Pedro de Velasco not only had those titles, but was as well the Constable of Castille, which made him head of the armies in the absence of the king. The Velascos are also one of the oldest, if not the oldest, lineages in Castile, with members of it documented in the 9th century, so no chance for the archbishop attacking Pedro de Velasco's ancestry. This Velasco was also a very important man in Burgos, where he had his home, the Casa del Cord #243;n, a beautiful and impressive palace. Burgos, the traditional head of Castile, was very prominent and wealthy, being the administrative see of the Consulate of the Sea, where administrative matters concerning the shipping of goods to Flanders was settled. The town councillors and the officers of the Consulate came from the most prominent and wealthiest families of Burgos, and most of them were of jewish or moorish ancestry, like the lineages of Cartagena, Salamanca, Santa Cruz, Gallo, Enzinas, and Pardo. Enforcing the Statutes would have been akin to depriving the city of its officers, so the Constable of Castile decided not to enforce them, to the point of telling Guijarro that if he wanted to enforce them, he should come to Burgos at the head of an army and do so manu militari. Of course, the archbishop backed off from the Constable's boast, and the Statutes became meaningless in Burgos.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>And you were probably taught some BS grisly torture methods that did not even exist, only appearing in texts thanks to the imagination of Romantic writers. Spiders, iron maiden, the wheel, thumb breaker, Judas' cradle... all BS. The Inquisition only used the rack, the strapado, and waterboarding. These methods don't produce blood effusions, as drawing blood would nullify the procedure. Curiously, the Inquisition did not really believe in the efficacy of torture as a method for extracting confessions. As stated in article 49 of the Inquisition's Instructions from the year 1500: "The prisoners, in that agony, would confess anything that is pointed to them, and from that come problems for the procedure, as it is produces damages to third persons and sets ground for revoking confessions".</TEXT>

    <TEXT>It is not up for debate, and never has been. The name America is first recorded in the map Universalis Cosmographia, by Martin Waldseem #252;ller, in 1507. The German cartographer placed the name America in what we call today South America as a way of stating Amerigo Vespucci's perceived relevance. Amerigo Vespucci (latinised as Americus Vespucius) was a very popular author at that time, and Waldseem #252;ller places his name in South America as a way of crediting his great explorations. Not only that, but Waldseem #252;ller includes a portrait of Vespucci in the upper part of the map, giving him a compass, marking him as a great cartographer. In that upper part you can also see Claudius Ptolemy. You can even see how much Waldseem #252;ller credits Amerigo in the upper left side of the map, where you can read: *Est enim terra per Columbum regis Castiliae capitaneum atque Americum Vesputium, magni et excellentis viros inventa.* Translation: And this land has been discovered by Columbus, captain of the king of Castile, and Amerigo Vespucci, excellent and great men.

The normal procedure for this was sending the letters with an envoy that was going to the place where the destinatory of the letter was residing. From Columbus' own letters to different people we know who some of his envoys were. For example, he sent letters to the Office of Saint George in Genoa through Franco Cattaneo, and also through Francesco da Rivarola, genoan merchants residing in Seville. In some other cases we don't know who his envoys were, like with the letter to Juana de Torres, or his letter of the third navigation.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>The news of Columbus' arrival back to Spain spread like wildfire. Columbus' letter to Sant #225;ngel was written on February the 15th 1493, and had an addendum on march 4th, when he made it to Lisbon. By mid-march, it was printed in two editions in Barcelona, one in Spanish (of which one specimen survives), and one in Catalan (no specimens survive, but we have references from Ferdinand Columbus' library). By next month, this letter had been translated into Latin by Leandro de Cosco in Rome. This translation was printed by Stephen Plannck. Within the same year, Cosco's translation was printed in Paris three times, and also in Basel and in Antwerp. In Rome it was printed two more times, and in Basel it was reprinted the next year. In 1497 it was translated into High German, with the translation having been made in Ulm. This translation was printed in Strassburg, and it is excedingly interesting. In the last lines of this version it is stated that it was translated from Latin and from Catalan, which means the Catalan edition had circulated too. So, by the end of 1493 the news of Columbus and his journey to the New World and back was well known throughout Europe: Portugal, Spain, the Italian Peninsula, France, the German Empire, Flanders... You also have to consider that print circulation was not the inly way of news spreading: merchants travel, and with them travel the news. With this in mind, we can safely assume that news of Columbus' expedition were already public information by the end of 1493. As for the most remote/isolated places, we can only guess.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Spain's 19th century is extremely turbulent, and all the things that happened made Spain mostly irrelevant in the World stage. Let's start at the beginning: Dixit Deus "fiat lux" et lux facta fuit. OK, maybe not that long ago. In 1776 the War of American independence began, and both Spain and France were major powers behind it and helped it happen. The 13 colonies obtained independence with the Treaty of Paris of 1783, and this independence sparked a whole idea of liberalism and independence in the Spanish America. Then came the French Revolution, in which a few people from the Spanish America took part, like Francisco de Miranda, the father of Venezuela. The French Revolution started a whole series of wars that spanned the whole continent of Europe for some 20 years, and part of them happened in Spain. Come the year 1808, and through some very complicated scheming, Charles IV of Spain lost his crown in favour of his son Ferdinand, who in turn eventually abdicated in favour of Napoleon I Emperor of the French. Napoleon, in turn, made his brother Joseph king of Spain, and that's where things started to go South. A whole popular uprising started, with part of the Spanish army siding against the French, and wanting Ferdinand back as king, as among other things he was Spanish, not some foreigner imposed by another bloody foreigner. There were 6 years of war and guerrilla warfare. During the fourth year, the Cortes (parliament) gathered in C #225;diz drafted and approved a Constitution, known as the 1812 constitution, the C #225;diz constitution, or La Pepa. This constitution limited the king's powers, and made the executive power a matter shared between the king and the parliament. The king swore it because he did not have any other options. When the war was won, he abolished it and back came the absolutism. With this war in place, there was some power vacuum in the Spanish America, with seriously conflicting loyalties. In 1810, a priest in Dolores (M #233;xico) made a proclamation in favour king Ferdinand VII, but it soon turned into something entirely different: the War of Mexican independence. With the Spanish troops in Spain being too busy fighting against the French, the viceroy of New Spain could not expect reinforcements. In that same year, more uprisings were underway in the Upper Peru. No sooner said than done, the whole Spanish America was up in arms, with the invaluable cooperation (but not free of cost) of the British. Spain could not deal with the multiple wars in the Spanish America, plus the war against the French. When the War of Spanish Independence ended in 1814, Ferdinand VII abolished the constitution and restored absolutism. This lead to many liberals being imprisoned, and many more exiled. Within the next years there were military uprisings in Spain trying to bring back liberalism, but all were repressed, until the year 1820. The troops that were going to be sent to fight in the Spanish America rebelled under the command of colonel Rafael del Riego in Las Cabezas de San Juan, proclaimed the constitution of 1812, and Ferdinand VII was forced to restore it. The constitutional rule lasted for 3 years until the army of the Holy Alliance came to Spain with a force of 100,000 men (known in Spain as "the 100,000 sons of Saint Louis, because it is much more polite to say that than saying "the 100,000 sons of bitches"), and restored absolutism again. It lasted until Ferdinand VII's death, a period known as The Ominous Decade. But things only get started now. With the death of Ferdinand, the heir was his then 3-year-old daughter Isabel. This was not taken well by Ferdinand's brother Carlos, who thought he was the legitimate heir. He was also an abosolutist. So, in 1833 we have the First Carlist War, between the carlist and the cristinists, a civil war that lasted for 7 years. The war being over does not mean the country would go back to normal. There were several coups d' #233;tat by different generals trying to impose their views, and that is something crippling to the economy and to the country itself. Power varied between the dictatorships of Narv #225;ez, the presidencies of O'Donnell, Espartero, and others. We even had a cabinet that lasted for one only day. In 1846 there was another carlist uprising, but of much more limited scale, that lasted for 3 years. In 1868, with all the corruption and mismanagements of the Crown and their ministers, revolution erupts, the Glorious Revolution. A provisional government was formed by the leaders: generals Prim and Serrano, and admiral Topete. Then the Parliament started debating on who should be king: Isabel had just been ousted, her son was definitely not an option. The duke of Montpensier not only had very bad press, but had killed one of the Queen's cousins (also a cousin of his) in a duel, so another option flies out the window. A German prince could have been an option, and Leopold von Hohenzollern-Sigmaringen was considered, but France strongly opposed it. In late 1870, an agreement was reached, and Amedeo, Duke of Aosta, would become constitutional king of Spain. Amedeo's joy did not last, his main proponent was murdered in late December of 1870, and the first thing he had to do when he set foot in Spain was attending his funeral. Things only got worse from there. In 1872 another Carlist uprising started, and by 1873 Amedeo called it quits with a speech that was tantamount to "fuck all of you, you are all insane, I'm leaving". Then came a Republic that lasted for one miserable year and four presidents, one of them calling it quits with the phrase "Honourable gentlemen, I'll be frank: I'm fucking sick of all of us" uttered in the Council of Ministers. You can see that with that much instability and that many civil wars, Spain entirely lost the point of colonialism and the status as a World power. The Spanish-American war was just the last nail in a coffin already closed. In the 19th century Spain had 14 years of civil wars, 6 years of a large war being fought on Spanish territory, over half a dozen regime changes, and some twenty coups d' #233;tat. That will cripple any country. TL;DR: A scarred country after a long war civil-warred and couped itself into irrelevance</TEXT>

    <TEXT>It was a very tumultuous year. In 1873 the I Republic was proclaimed in Spain, but without a strong republican popular base. The Republic started with the III Carlist War underway, but matters got only worse. In July, the "intransigent" republicans did not want to wait until the Parliament would have drafter a federal constitution, so a number of federalist rebellions erupted throughout the country. The most famous one is the Canton of Cartagena, but there were other cantonalist rebellions in Valencia, Salamanca, M #225;laga, Seville, C #225;diz, and a long etcetera. The intransigents were not going to accept what was being written, because they wanted federalism, and they wanted it at once. This rebellions lasted for the rest of the year 1873 and ended in mid-January of 1874. On January the 3rd 1874, general Pav #237;a staged a coup d' #233;tat, taking the Parliament with his soldiers, and putting an end to the Republic. This started the short period known as Serrano's dictatorship, that lasted until the end of the year. Formally, Spain was still a republic, but de facto it was just Serrano in command. Serrano was strongly opposed to the return of the Bourbon dynasty he had ousted five years earlier, but the restoration of the monarchy was underway, whether he liked it or not. Antonio C #225;novas del Castillo, a cunning and smart politician, alongside Pr #225;xedes Mateo Sagasta, of the same ilk, planned the coming back of prince Alfonso, but not without the colaboration of other parties that just wanted some stability for Spain and saw in young Alfonso. The 29th of December of 1874, general Arsenio Mart #237;nez Campos, in Sagunto, proclaimed Alfonso XII King of Spain, while Serrano was overseeing the operations of the Carlist War in the north of Spain. Soon, many captains general sided with Mart #237;nez Campos, including the captain general of Madrid, Fernando Primo de Rivera. With the army taking sides against the Republic, Serrano opposed no resistance and just accepted the fact of the restoration. In early January 1875 Alfonso XII entered Spain amongst cheering crowds.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>The Portuguese Pedralvares Cabral (this is the orthography preferred by some Portuguese scholars like Pinheiro Marques) stumbled upon the coast of Brazil in april of the year 1500 when he was performing the manoeuvre known as "grande volta". This consisted in going from Cape Verde distancing yourself from the coast of Africa in order to take advantage of the currents that take you to Good Hope. A couple months prior, Vicente Y #225; #241;ez Pinz #243;n reached the coast of Brazil in what today is Mucuripe. He continued his journey following Brazil's coast to the North, discovering the Amazon river in the process. Diego de Lepe reached Brazil in February, and eventually joined Pinz #243;n around the mouth of the Amazon. I tell all of this in more detail in this other answer.

    <TEXT>Copyright was kind of sort of a thing, but let me start with theatre. The standard procedure for a comediographer when he wrote a comedy would be to sell his manuscript to a theatrical company, and that would be the end of it. Different authors had different cach #233;s based on their popularity, just like actors do today. Lope de Vega was very well paid, normally getting some 5,000 reales per comedy, and he could write them like crazy based on formulaic elements, and recycling material. Lope wrote a formidable amount of theatrical pieces, somewhere around 650 plays. The figure is not exact because there are many things circulating under his name that are not his. In his Arte nuevo de hazer comedias en este tiempo (Madrid, 1609) he claims to have written 473 up to that date, and we the siglodeoristas tend to consider it an accurate figure. If after that date he slowed his rate writing only one comedy per month until his death, you get to over 600, which is not unthinkable for Lope de Vega, the most prolific playwright the world has ever seen. Other writers don't even scratch that number: Luis V #233;lez de Guevara wrote some 250 plays, Claramonte some 200, Calder #243;n only wrote 110 theatrical pieces (including entremeses, autos sacramentales, j #225;caras, and mojigangas)... When the playwright sells his comedy to a stage company, he loses control over it, it becomes a property of the company, and they could tweak it in any way the see fit. Of course, some actors had a better control of their repertoires: Andr #233;s de Claramonte was a company director and an actor, so quite frequently he used his own company for performing his plays. However, as he died in 1626, things start to get confusing with his plays, more often than not getting credited to the authors that were fashionable in any given year: that's why you see the first version of "El alcalde de Zalamea" under Lope's name, same with "La Estrella de Sevilla", "Tan largo me lo fiais" was credited to Calder #243;n, "El Burlador de Sevilla" got credited under Tirso de Molina, etc. Back to the books. Authors would normally go to printers-booksellers and arrive to an agreement for the publication of their works. The printer would pay them upfront a portion of the expected sales, and then they would keep the rest of the revenue. Cervantes, when he wrote Don Quixote, had asked for permission from the Council of State to print the book, and asked for a privilege of exclusivity for 20 years. This would have allowed him to have his book printed with whichever printer he chose for that amount of time, and in case any printer would countervene that privilege, they would face conficastion and hefty fines. Cervantes eventually got a privilege for 10 years for Castile, Arag #243;n, and Portugal. In Castile, his agreement was with Juan de la Cuesta and Francisco de Robles, in Madrid. In Arag #243;n, he settled with Pedro Patricio Mey, in Valencia. In Portugal he did not settle with anyone, but his book being very popular, printer Craesbeeck published it without authorisation. Cervantes, not wanting to go to Portugal to denounce the man, just let the thing be, as it was not worth the hassle. What could an author do if he found unauthorised versions of his books, or books printed under his name that were not his? Go to court or to the Inquisition. Francisco de Quevedo once saw an opuscule under his name that he had not written, and he denounced that before the Inquisition, which acted swiftly confiscating any specimens of that book that were still for sale. Theatre could also be published, either in the form of "sueltas" (a comedy alone, without any fancy things like binding), or in the form of compilations. This is all a kerfuffle as there were many unauthorised versions, with printers-booksellers buying manuscript copies from actors and then compiling a bunch of plays. It gets even worse as from 1625 to 1634 there was a ban on printing theatre in the realms of Castile. What did printers do? Forge the covers. The 1630 edition of "Parte Doze de comedias" was allegedly printed in Barcelona by Ger #243;nimo Margarit, but typographic analysis has established for good that it was actually printed in Seville by Francisco de Lira and Miguel de Sande. If you see any theatrical volume printed in the reals of Arag #243;n between 1625 and 1634, there is a 90% chance that the "house mark" is fake. Theatre was such a huge business that it had a jurisdiction of its own, established in 1608, with the Ordinances being updated in 1615. Think of it as sports today, with the Administrative Tribunal of Sporting Matters in Spain, or the Court d'Arbitrage du Sport in Switzerland. The "judges of the theatres" would settle copyright disputes, foul play between theatrical companies, illegitimate modifications of texts, etc. There is a fun example I wrote about on this very forum, and which I proceed to link below. It was a dispute between Hortensio F #233;lix Paravicino and Pedro Calder #243;n in 1629, as Calder #243;n had unlawfully inserted half a dozen verses into a comedy he performed at the Royal Palace. Hortensio, being a crybaby, took the matter to the judge of the theatres, and even complained to the President of the Council of Castile, who just about told him to grow a pair.

Spain is not the most densely populated country in Europe considering traditional measurement (population / surface). However, most of Spain is actually empty. Only 13% of the square kilometres in Spain are inhabited, which leads to Spain having an "actual living density" of 737 people per square kilometre, which is the third highest in Europe (only behind Monaco and Malta). To further state this point: 23 of Europe's 33 most densely populated square kilometres are in Spain, with peak density in a square kilometre in L'Hospitalet where 53,000 people live. https://www.lavanguardia.com/vida/20180126/44292753470/espana-europa-densidad-poblacion-estudio-barcelona-madrid.html</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Correct. For example, Sidi Yahya al Nayar, son of Muley Hasan, converted to christianity (taking the name of Alonso de Granada) and became one of the most trusted generals in the last war between Castile and Granada. He received titles, lands, etc. One of his grandsons was one of the most trusted generals of John of Austria when putting down the rebellion of the Alpujarras. Felipe de  #193;frica was the son of a deposed sultan of Morocco in the late 16th and early 17th century, and I'm quite sure he served in the Spanish army. If you are interested in Abram Gannibal, I suggest you read "The black man of Peter the Great", by Alexander Pushkin.</TEXT>

A pandemic fucking a whole calendar up is definitely a higher force, but let me give you a more clear example in line with yours: You hire someone to clean your car, and the deadline for doing so is August the 10th. By August the 20th your car is not cleaned and you decide to sue the man. The guy did not meet the deadline, that is correct, but not out of malice but because he was in hospital with a broken leg.

    <TEXT>In Spanish law the concept of force majeure exists as well. I will give you its definition according to the General Council of the Judiciary Power: *Unforeseeable and unavoidable circumstance that alters the conditions of an obligation. Typical instances of force majeure are natural extraordinary phenomena such as catastrophic floods, earthquakes, the strike of lightning, etc.* *Force Majeure excludes responsibility both contractually and extracontractually, in the relations between individuals, and so does it when it comes to the responsibilities of the Public Administrations. "Force majeure, as we have so many times declared, not only demands for it to come from an occurrence that is unforeseeable and unavoidable, as in happenstance, but that it has its origins in an irresistible force extraneous to the acting capacities of the agent.\[...\]"*</TEXT>

    <TEXT>It would not void it. The only way to annull a clause in a contract would be to have a judge do so. In order for a clause to be null, it has to be something that is against the law, for example the nowadays famous "bottom clauses" (cl #225;usulas suelo) in a number Spanish mortgages. As for force majeure, it's not something one would normally include in a contract, it would be rather odd. A circumstance of force majeure would by itself be sufficient grounds for a contractual clause to be altered ex and de facto, as with this case. The June the 10th date has to be understood in relation to the sports calendar, being 10 days after the season is over, which is some time that gives the player the ability to look back at the season and consider whether to remain or to leave.

I would recommend checking the Almanach de Gotha or some other bibliography on German nobility from the 19th century.

I'm still waiting for "Mission in Paris" and "Alqu #233;zar's revenge", but I think Reverte is not really into Alatriste anymore. Awfully sorry for having misunderstood your comment.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I've been a fan of the novels since I was in high school. My dad is an acquaintance of the author as they have a couple of common friends, that's why I have three of them signed. One of them is signed by the author and one of the "characters" (Reverte enjoys throwing in other Spanish writers as characters). The movie was very underwhelming. A peeve of mine is having Elena Anaya as Ang #233;lica, when Ang #233;lica is described as having golden hair. As for Rocroy, the most interesting thing I've read is the diary of the Cardinal de Retz. It really gives you insight into what the battle meant for the French. We're huge francophiles at home, my father being a philologist specialised in Laforgue. Odd guy he is, he has a PhD in Iberian Studies from the Universit #233; de Rennes-Haute Bretagne, and a PhD in French philology from the Unkversity if Valladolid.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Charles V getting the spanish titles was luck. The amount of tragedies that needed to happen for him to hit the jackpot was staggering. Let's explain: Queen Isabel of Castile was married to king Ferdinand of Aragon (who also had Naples, Sicily, and Sardinia). They had a number of sons and daughters that would have priority in the matters of inheriting the crowns. \- Prince Juan, AKA the prince who died of love. He was married to Margaret of Austria in 1497. The poor guy died after only six months of marriage, leaving his wife pregnant. The mourning and depression lead to a miscarriage. \- Infanta Isabel of Arag #243;n and Castile, queen consort of Portugal. She married Manuel I of Portugal in 1497. She fell pregnant, and died giving birth to a son in 1498: \-- Miguel de la Paz, crown prince of Portugal, prince of Asturias, and Gerona. Died at two years of age. All of these would have been earlier in line than Charles V for getting the Spanish realms. Furthermore, Ferdinand of Aragon married Germaine of Foix in the hopes of getting Aragon out of Philip the Handsome's hands knowing that his daughter Joanna was not in good mental health. Of this second marriage came a son: \- Juan of Aragon and Foix, born in 1509, lived for two hours.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>It's a really complex issue, to be fair. Atrocities did exist, but they were not exclusively a Spanish phenomenon, and Spain was not any worse than the other nations, but it definitely lacked any sort of serious propaganda machine. There has been much talk about the Spanish Inquisition, and pop culture keeps the black legend alive and kicking. However, the Inquisition was not something that only existed in Spain, and the Spanish Inquisition had far more legal guarantees than any other court of law in Europe at the time. For example, under inquisitorial process, you had the right to be assisted by an attorney, and in case you did not know one, the court would provide it for you. If you were not able to afford the legal counsel, it would be paid out of the Court's treasury. This right appears in the Inquisition's instructions as early as 1484, but in England it did not appear until the Prisoners Act of 1836. Torture, to give another example, was never trusted by the Inquisition as a way of extracting confessions, as seen in articles 49, 50, and 53 of the Inquisition's Instructions dictated by Diego de Deza in the year 1500. Another thing commonly associated with the Inquisition, due to propaganda, is the witch-hunts, when in actual fact the Spanish Inquisition called bullshit on the whole witchcraft thing in 1614, after a revision of the Zugarramurdi process by the Supreme Council of the General Inquisition, that arrived to the conclusion that witchcraft does not exist, it being cases of individual or colective hysteria, combined with a hefty dose of bad faith from the accusers. The Zugarramurdi verdict was overturned by the Inquisition, the families' honour was restored, and with hunting simply stopped. Concerning the conquest of the Americas, no serious Spanish historian calls it genocide. Genocide requires intent to eliminate an ethnic, religious, or political group, while the Spanish conquistadors never intended to wipe entire nations out. Not out christian piety or anything like that, but due to the feudal mentality. The conquistadors were willing to carve fiefdoms for themselves, very large fiefdoms if it was possible, and fiefdoms are entirely useless if nobody is there to toil the mines, plough the fields, pay rent, and pay taxes. The ideas they had in mind came from the Reconquista, where a number of noble and low-nobility families rose to prominence thanks to military service, earning fiefdoms. As early as the time of Isabel the Catholic, the people of the Americas were considered subjects of the Crown of Castile, not really out of piety, but for pragmatic reasons. If they were ordinary vassals of the Crown, like a regular peasant from Oca #241;a, a merchant from Burgos, or a shepherd from Badajoz, it means they had to pay taxes and had legal obligations to the crown or the lords temporal or spiritual. Of course, things being not only very different in America, but being an entire ocean away, different laws had to be established for the new American realities, and the Crown took a lot of effort in protecting the new American subjects, from quite the beginning with the Laws of Burgos-Valladolid of 1512, and then much more legislation. The encomiendas, for instance, can be described as some sort of servitude that would be transitory until the continent was fully christian. Think of it as an intermediate step towards feudalism. Spain was not any worse than any other nations, and in some aspects it was actually better. A friend of mine, who happens to be a philosophy teacher, always says that the great difference between Spain and England in the matters of empire is the religious doctrine behind it: Spain is the nation of free will (liberum arbitrium), unlike the determinist protestats. The Conference of Valladolid of 1550, considered by the experts as the first human rights convention, is something rather unique: a superpower stopping its expansion and having a human rights conference to determine whether what they were doing was morally, religiously, and legally adequate, arriving to the conclusion that it was not, and then having new legislation passed.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>My comment was limited to Charles hitting the jackpot of the Spanish realms, which is more or less tragically good luck. The double marriage as a way of securing a hispano-imperial alliance was very solid and politically sound, but the idea of Philip the Handsome getting to be king of the Spanish realms probably never crossed Maximilian's mind. Juan should have produced heirs with Habsburg blood, and that was very important. However, Isabel was ahead of Juana in the order of succession, and with her the heirs she could produce in Portugal.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>There is not much talk about Columbus in Spain besides the first voyage. However, in the last decade, the leftist parties have started a campaign to demonise Columbus and the Spanish empire in general, talking about genocide, and basically saying that the Americas were some sort of cumbay #225; place with no crimes and where everyone lived in peace and harmony. Of course, reality is more complex than the bullshit caricatures presented by the left and their "nada que celebrar" agenda. Columbus was an utter bastard, but not the bloodthirsty genocidal monster that he is frequently painted as. His bastardry was not limited to the Indians, though; he was just as bad and tyrannical towards the Spaniards (Bobadilla's inquiry is a really discomforting read). *books of the evil spanish that destroyed civilizations and brought the worse to the continent* Modern perspective pays a lot of attention on the importance of the native conquistadors. The Spaniards did not have the manpower to overpower empires like the Aztecs and the Incas, but they had the very willing collaboration of the peoples that had been opressed by the aztecs. In the case of the Inca empire, Pizarro and his gang found an empire in a state of civil war, being fought between Atahualpa an Huascar. Of course, not everything was wine and roses. Alongside the Spaniards came the diseases that wiped some 90% of the American population like flu, smallpox, cholera, salmonella, etc.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Oh, boy, is that some serious revisionism. Let's get some context. In the year 1700, king Charles II of Castile, Aragon, bla bla bla, died without offspring. His grand-nephew Philip (duke of Anjou) had the best claim on the throne that we shall call Spanish out of simplicity. Archduke Charles of Austria (Charles II's second cousin) claimed the Spanish throne too, though his rights on it were weaker than Philip's as he was a more distant relative of the deceased king. Of course, this meant war and war happened on a continental scale. Philip was sworn in as king by the parliaments (in a feudal sense) of both the Crowns of Castile and Aragon. This feudal concept was of reciprocity (it becomes important): the king is sworn in by the parliament and he has to swear he shall respect the laws, customs, privileges, immunities, etc of the realms he is intended to rule. So, Philip gets sworn in by the Castilian cortes, the Aragonese cortes, the Catalan cortes, etc throughout the years 1701 and 1702. Come the year 1705, and a group of Catalan merchants from the zone of Vic (hence the name vigatans) that were in favour Charles of Austria, without having any sort of authority, arrive to an agreement with England that is signed in Genova. Through this pact they would take over the Catalan institutions, renounce their fealty to Philip, and swear Charles of Austria as king and try get him on the Spanish throne. More or less, Chales was supported by the territories of the crown of Aragon, and Philip of Anjou was supported by the territories of the crown of Castile. These are very broad strokes as, for example, Madrid supported Chales of Austria. Eventually, Philip of Anjou would take over the austriacist territories of the crown of Aragon, stripping them of their privileges as they had broken faith with him by proclaiming a different king, which meant that the 1702 oaths were no longer valid as one party had cast them aside. Catalonia was the last austriacist bastion, being farther away from the capital, and Barcelona eventually fell on September 11th 1714 after a rather long siege. By the same concept under which he stripped Valencia and Aragon of their rights and immunities, so he did with Catalonia. This brought legal unity and the start of the modern Spanish state. It's generally agreed that under archduke Charles of Austria, the Spanish realms would have stayed the same as they had under the Habsburgs: a personal union, id est the king of the Crown of Castile was the same person as the king of the Crown of Aragon, but each of the crowns would keep different legal systems, coinage, etc. So, claiming that Spain annexed Catalonia in 1714 is quite a stretch. There was a very long civil war that pitched two different candidates for the Spanish throne, and the french one won. It's definitely not a war of Spain against Catalonia.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>The quote is slightly wrong, it does not say "the three senses" but "three senses" without the article. If you check texts from the same period, you will see references to "the five senses". Zuazo, however, is talking about food, that's why he mentions the need to scrutinise it using three of the senses: sight, smell, and taste. I'll give you the quote and translate it: "V #233;ndense asimismo muchas frutas, manzanas, ciruelas blancas, andrinas negras, e ciruelas coloradas, uvas muy buenas, aunque dicen que son salvajes; #160;con otro gran g #233;nero y especies de frutas, cuyos nombres no escribo, pues por ello V.

    <TEXT>The current population distribution has a lot to do with the 20th century's rural exodus. In the past century, a hefty portion of the population moved from villages to cities as agriculture became more efficient, less manpower was needed, and the cities offered better jobs specially in the industrial sector. This, of course, led to cities doubling, tripling or multiplying their populations, which had the peculiar effect of a population density that does not match the actual living density. Spain's population density is 95 people per Km #178;, which is low. However, only 13% of Spain's square kilometres are populated, which eventually results in a living density of 735 people per square kilometre, the highest in Europe. Just to compare, 65% of Spain's population live in apartments, while in France it is 32%, and more or less the same in the UK. As for politics, until the 20th century the general population was heavily disconnected from the government, and actually ruled by local or regional oligarchies (caciques we call them) that more or less paid lip service to whoever was ruling in Madrid.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Sorry, but Coru #241;a has nothing to do with corona. It was a toponym appeared ex novo in 1208 by king Alfonso of Le #243;n. Prior to that date, the village was named Faro (because there is a highly noticeable 60 meter tall Roman lighthouse there). Why was it renamed Crunia? Well, Alfonso had read the Historia Turpini, and in book III the cities conquered by Charlemagne are mentioned. In Gallaecia, most of them are clearly identifiable (Mindonia, Tuda, Lucum, Auria, Bracara, Vimaranis, etc), but Crunia was not clear in the least. Modern researchers have suggested, and it is very well supported, that the toponym Crunia is a textual transmission error and it should be read as Cauria. So, our toponym comes from a king trying to make a city appear.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>It's the other way around: sugarcane was introduced to the Americas from Europe. In fact, there were important sugarcane plantations in the South of Spain, like the Kingdom of Granada, and in the East of Spain, most notably around Valencia. Sugar was used for pastries (called in Spain "frutas de sart #233;n" or "pan fruits"), cakes, and for confitures and jams. Jams and confitures are a very good way of preserving fruits, and some regions were renowned for the quality of their preserves like Valencia. The preserves of Valencia are even mentioned as something valuable in the Lazarillo de Tormes, written ca. 1548-1550. As for recipes, you can check cookbooks like the Llibre de Sent Sov #237;, from the 14th century, and you'll find uses for sugar.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>The Statutes of Blood Pureness (Estatutos de Limpieza de sangre) are not from 1447 but from 1547. They were instituted by the archbishop of Toledo, cardinal Mart #237;ndz Guijarro, and they were relatively controversial in its own time. Many civil servants had been or were of Jewish or morisco ancestry, or had been actual Jews like Luis de Sant #225;ngel, who had been chief accountant of the Crown of Aragon, and treasurer general of the Holy Brotherhood in Castile. He was not the only one. Andr #233;s Cabrera, one of the top officers of Queen Isabel was of Jewish ancestry, and his relative Abraham Seneor was Jewish himself. The Statutes were of unequal enforcement throughout the realms, and even throughout the cities, the most notable case being Burgos, where the Commercial Consulate had its see, and were a hefty percentage of the town councillors and officers were of converso ancestry. So much so that the Constable of Castile actually threatened Mart #237;nez Guijarro that if he wanted to enforce the Statutes in Burgos he would have to do so at the head of an army. The notable lineages of Enzinas, Cartagena, Salamanca, Santa Cruz and many others remained safe and in office in Burgos thanks to the protection of the Constables of Castile. The humanity of the natives, and the question of the legality and the legitimacy of the Spanish conquest of the Americas did not really have much to do with the Statutes of Blood Purity. The Spanish Jews and Muslims were undeniable human, though not christians, but the natives of America were seen as a different problem altogether, as they were actual pagans and of very different backgrounds and development. Furthermore, Queen Isabel had considered them as much subjects of the Crown as the inhabitants of Castile. However, the monarchs considered they had the duty to christianise them as per the pontificial bulls issued by pope Alexander VI. This led to the development of the encomiendas, that can be seen as a transitional status between the "uncivilised" situation and the christianisation of the territory that should lead them to be subjects of the Crown of actually equal terms to to those in the Iberian Peninsula. Of course, this is was the intent, but not the result. The encomiendas became a system of pseudo-slavery, which eventually caused to be abolished. Out of pure pragmatism, the Crown promoted the marriage of Spaniards and natives most notably from 1514 onwards. The marriage of Spaniards to the local aristocracies should result in local rulers of Spanish origin with the local legitimacy of being related to the traditional ruling classes. The native aristocrats that co-operated with the Spanish conquest and subsequently with the Spsnish viceroyal administration got rewarded with letters patent of nobility, public offices, etcetera.</TEXT>

The conquest of Granada becomes a game-changer. With the control of the whole territory, the Catholic Monarchs started to focus on religious uniformity in their realms, hence the expulsion of the jews in March 1492 (Edict of Granada), campaigns for the conversion of the moriscos, etc.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>*The French and Spanish frequently tried to match the Royal Navy throughout their centuries of rivalry, but the RN was able to best them every time, even when fighting both of them at once and outnumbered.* This is straight up wrong. For more than two centuries, or close to three centuries Spain was the first naval power in the world, dominating the Atlantic, establishing a very safe transport route between Spain and the Americas (only 3% of the ships of the Fleet of Indies were lost during the entire 250 years existence of the Fleet system), and also dominating the Pacific Ocean to the point that it was frequently referred to as the Spanish Lake. The Grande y Felic #237;ssima Armada that failed to invade England in 1588 is very well-known, but the next year the English sent an even larger fleet to attack Spain that was soundly defeated in Coru #241;a (where they lost more than a third of the men and a quarter of the ships) and Lisbon. The counter-armada is not nearly half as well known as the Grande y Felic #237;ssima Armada (the whole invincible part is propaganda, not something even remotely stated by any Spanish source). Spain was also able to defeat the English or British navy on several occasions, dealing some serious blows. In Spain nowadays the most famous of such encounters is the siege of Cartagena de Indias (1741), when a fleet of 60 warships and 135 armoured transport ships, with over 30,000 soldiers and 4,000 auxiliaries failed to capture the city of Cartagena, defended by 6 ships, 3,000 soldiers, and 600 indigenous archers. Of course, Blas de Lezo had a solid defensive advantage, but he was hilariously outnumbered. The capture of the double British convoy in the year 1780 also comes to mind. Old admiral C #243;rdova and the audacious captain Mazarredo managed to capture a 55-ships strong convoy carrying vital supplies to the British troops in America. In that action, C #243;rdova and Mazarredo captured 300 guns, 80,000 muskets, 3,000 barrels of gundpowder, hundreds of thousands of musket balls, thousands of cannon balls, equipment for 12 regiments, and one million pounds in cash. This action made the war unwinnable for Great Britain, and bakrupted many companies in the London Stock Exchange. The actual scoreboard between Spain and England is more less even when it comes to naval warfare. The same way as Britain ruled the seas in the 19th century, Spain ruled them during the 16th, 17th, and part of the 18th centuries.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Spain never recovered from the battle of Trafalgar. A substantial chunk of the Spanish navy was sunk or damaged in that battle, and from then onwards Spain could not recover. In 1808 the country was invaded by the French, which resulted in a 6 year long war throughout the whole of Spain where both the French and the British (alleged allies of Spain) destroyed everything they could, crippling the Spanish economy. Then came two dozen coups d' #233;tat, and the rebellion of the Spanish America. If that was not enough, from 1833 to 1840 Spain had a civil war. And downhill from there. As you see, in the 19th century Spain could not catch a break.</TEXT>

English theatre, though, did not really have any relevant impact in Spain. The 1630s were the years in which Calder #243;n was best buddies with the King, and when he created his most brilliant plays such as "Life is a dream". Calder #243;n was all the rage, Lope was still a bankable writer, Mira de Amescua and V #233;lez de Guevara created brilliant plays (V #233;lez also was extremely succesful among the ladies) and ocasionally colaborated with their good friend Calder #243;n...

    <TEXT>It's not really restricted, it is simply lack of interest combined with the book not being well catalogued. As you mention, studying the spread of English books in Early Modern Spain is a very niche thing. Furthermore, this discovery was more or less happenstance, the scholar was studying something else entirely when he stumbled upon the book. It also happens that many catalogues from not very well known libraries are outdated, so there is probably a fair share of interesting books that are wrongly catalogued for one reason or the other.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I'll complement my comment a bit. - A magistrate is a judge with at least three years of experience. - To become a judge there are two ways: having a degree in Law and passing the access exam to the judiciary/prosecutorial career, or being a jurist of recognised prestige with at least ten years of professional experience in the field of Law. This latter option is called "fourth turn" and the people that access the judiciary career in this way are normally professors or prestigious lawyers. The appointments to the Supreme Court are made by the General Council of the Judiciary Power. Of course, the appointments of members of the CGJP (CGPJ in Spanish) is rather politicised, as the councillors have to be appointed by a 3/5 majority of the parliament.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>It would not require a constitutional ammendment, just an act of Congress to set up requirements for the Supreme Court. The constitution simply establishes the Supreme Court and its powers, but its composition is regulated by the Judiciary Act of 1869. So, an act of Congress can be passed in order to establish requirements for the Supreme Court, with no need for a constitutional amendment. I would also like to add that Spain's Supreme Court is not as small as the US' that only has 9 justices. Spain's Supreme Court is composed of five halls of justice, divided by legal specialisation: - First Hall is the hall on civil matters. - Second Hall is the one on criminal matters. - Third Hall, administrative matters. - Fourth Hall, social matters. - Fifth Hall, military matters. Each hall is composed of 15 magistrates, but when a case is brought before the Court, only 7 compose the tribunal.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>In the case of what we know today as Spain there have been a number of small scale conflicts between different feudal lords in the High/Late Middle Ages, some better known than others. The wars in Biscay called Guerras Banderizas were wars between two main nobiliary factions (o #241;acinos and gambo #237;nos) that lasted for decades. There were based more or less on chevauch #233;es and other such actions, and eventually involved just about all of the relevant noble families of the region. In the last decades of the 15th century there was a long war between the duke of Medina Sidonia and the marquess of C #225;diz (Rodrigo Ponce de Le #243;n) for the possession of the almadrabas of C #225;diz and Rota, that ended with the peace agreement between them signed in 1472. Gonzalo Fern #225;ndez de Oviedo, in his Batallas y Quinquagenas, frequently talks on the wars and conflicts between different noblemen, and gives a particular report on the case of Juan N #250; #241;ez de Prado and the wars against his enemies. During the time of Henry IV of Castile, there were many small wars between noblemen, or even nobles against the church, forcing the crown to intervene in more than one instance, as was the case when Isabel the Catholic came to the throne. In Galicia, Pedro Pardo de Cela had usurped a couple of fortresses from the blishop of Mondo #241;edo, and finally entrenched himself in the tower of Frouseira. Eventually, the Queen's justice intervened manu militari to put an end to this, finally capturing Pedro Pardo and executing him for treason as he failed to comply with the Queen's direct orders of him surrendering his fortress to the bishop of Mondo #241;edo. Worse thing is that Pedro Pardo was not an isolated case: Pedro  #193;lvarez de Soutomaior was constantly at war against the count of Ribadavia, the Moscosos were frequently at war with the Pardos, the Lanz #243;s against the Andrades. In the words of Jer #243;nimo Zurita, chronicler, "estaban los nobles muy arriscados unos contra otros" (the lords were very entrenched ones against the others). They would even profit from the civil wars of Castile or other wars to wage their particular feuds, as the famous case of Pedro Madruga usurping the village of Tuy and taking the bishop as hostage, or taking a son of the Count-Duke of Benavente hostage during the castilian civil war of 1474-79, in which he sided with the king of Portugal.</TEXT>

This is the story of a man born into a powerful family holding lots of land and being of considerable wealth, and also not short of power.

    <TEXT>Long story short: For some time, there was a placard or banner on the fa #231;ade of the Palace of the Generalitat reading "Free political prisoners and exiles" with a yellow ribbon. Then, elections came, and Ciudadanos denounced the presence of the banner to the Electoral Board. The Electoral Board, the highest electoral authority, issued a mandate for Quim Torra to remove the banner within 48 hours, as the banner can be considered partisan, and the institutions have a duty of neutrality during the electoral campaign. Torra publicly said he would disobey and not take it down. He then received a second mandate. Eventually, after the deadlines had already passed, he removed the banner. Disobeying a court mandate, or an authority's mandate is a felony, and for politicians it is punished with being barred from office. In this particular case, 14 months. I have to say that the Electoral Board is particularly strict with the duty of neutrality. In 2008, during the electoral campaign, there was a banner in the fa #231;ade of the Provincial Deputation of Castell #243;n reading "Water for everyone". The Electoral Board issued a mandate to the Deputation ordering them to take it down during the electoral period. They complied.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Rodrigo de Borja (also known as Pope Alexander VI) never even tried to keep hidden his paternity over his sons, and neither did any of the top members of the Catholic church who happened to have had a family of their own: Cardinal Pedro Gonz #225;lez de Mendoza, known as "the Great Cardinal of Spain" or "the third king of Spain" had three sons, whom he loved to no end. His sons were regulars of the Court of Castille, and Queen Isabel the Catholic adored them, to the point of calling them "the cardinal's beautiful sins". Mendoza managed to have his sons legitimised by the Queen and the Pope, and had them receive some neat fiefdoms and titles of nobility. As for Alexander VI, I will quote a passage from [a letter of his he sent to the Catholic Monarchs](http://pares.mcu.es/ParesBusquedas20/catalogo/show/2205437?nm) telling them about his elections as pope, and recommending them his son C #233;sar for some office or the other: \[...\] *Ceterum cum ob hac nostram assumptionem inter alia quae tenebamus beneficia Archiepiscopatum valentinum et monasterium vallis digne vacare contigisset: cogitantes qua prontissimum illis preficere deberemus non posuit nobis magis idoneus se offerri quam dilectus filius Caesar de Borgia electus pampilonensis* \[...\] *Datum Rome apud Sanctum Petrum sub annulo piscatoris die xxiiij Augusti MCCCLXXXXIJ. Ante coronationem nostram.* **Translation**: Furthermore, with Our assumption, the benefices we had must vacate, among which the archbishopric of Valencia and the monastery of Valldigna, knowing that we shall grant them very soon, a more idoneous candidate than my beloved son C #233;sar de Borgia, bishop elect of Pamplona, cannot be offered. Given in Rome, at Saint Peter, under the Fisher's ring, August 22nd 1492. Before Our coronation. The part about him having sex with his daughter, or his daughter having sex with C #233;sar, is categorically false, nothing more than a smear campaign coming from the Roman nobility and the pope's enemies. Alexander VI was no worse than the rest of the cardinals, but definitely not substantially better, but he was a foreigner, and the traditional roman nobility were not taking well to have someone from outside rule over what they considered their own thing.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>The amount of contemporary evidence for Columbus being Genovese is absolutely enormous, with testimonies from everywhere. Let's get into business: Columbus had a meeting with the Catholic Monarchs in 1491, for discussing the voyage to the Indies. For this kind of business, you had to go through the Court's registrar, in this case Doctor Lorenzo Gal #237;ndez de Carvajal, whose short registry we possess. In that year it is said: *Capitulation with Christopher Columbus, genovese, natural of Savona, for the discovery of the Indies* Angelo Trevisan, secretary to the Venetian ambassador before the Catholic Monarchs, in the year 1500-1 managed to become a good friend of Chritopher Columbus, whom he always mentions as "genovese" (zenovese, in Venetian language). Thanks to Christopher Columbus, he procured himself a copy of a navigation chart of the Indies, made in Palos (today Palos de la Frontera). One of the letters reads: *Cristoforo Columbo, zenovese, homo di alta et procera statura, rosso, de grande inzegno*... (Christopher Columbus, genovese, man of remarkable and tall height, redhead, of great ingenuity) The ambassador of the Catholic Monarchs before the Court of Henry VII, Ayala, writes in 1497 a letter to his sovereigns stating that the King of England has hired a navigator, a certain Cabot, "genovese like Columbus". Christopher Columbus himself, in a letter from 1501, as a sign of eternal gratitude, wanted to bequeath 10% of his income from the Indies to the city of Genoa, and so he instructs his friend Nicol #243; Oderigo, genovese ambassador, to sort out the paperwork. Bureaucracy being bureaucracy, they manage to never respond to Columbus, which lead to Columbus not bequeathing that. This was cancelled in 1504, in a letter that I translate: *Virtuous sir: When I departed for the voyage from which I now come, I talked to you for a long time: I think you may recall everything. I thought that when I would be back, I would find letters from you, and even a person with whom to speak. In that time I had left to Francesco da Rivarola a copying book of my letters and another one of my privileges, in a case of red cordovan leather with a lock made of silver, and two letters to the Office of Saint George, where I assigned a tenth of my income, discounted the levies on wheat and other supplies: I did not hear any news of it. Misser Francesco says everything made it to Genoa. If that is so, it was a great discourtesy not to have answered, and that is why they are not getting their estate augmented* \[...\] This Nicol #243; Oderigo, when writting to Christopher Columbus, always calls him "amantissimus concivis", which translates as "very beloved concitizen", which is a clear sign of Oderigo being aware of Columbus' origin. It is not the only case of Christopher Columbus being straightly related to Genoa. In his memorial of debts, written in articulo mortis in may 1506, in the city of Valladolid, he settles some old debts, and all of them are with genovese people (and with the genovese Bartolomeo Fieschi as witness). The most relevant part, is that we know the exact nature of two of those debts: 1. A debt with Paolo de Negro and Lodisio Centurione Scotto. This one matches a debt recognised before a notary in 1478 by a certain Cristoforo Colombo, citizen of Genoa, aged 27, who was due to depart to Lisbon on the morrow. 2. A debt to Gerolamo da Porto, father of Benedetto da Porto chancellor in Genoa. This one matches a debt contracted in 1470 by a certain Cristoforo Colombo, citizen of Genoa, aged 19, son of Domenico Colombo. Gonzalo Fern #225;ndez de Oviedo, in his General and Natural History of the Indies, book II, specifically says the Columbus was from Liguria, though he is not exactly sure from where, doubting between Savona, Nervi, and Cogoleto. Let's keep in mind that Gonzalo de Oviedo was raised alongside Christopher Columbus' sons, and met the man in more than one occasion. Bartolom #233; de las Casas, a good friend of Hernando Col #243;n, everywhere mentions that Columbus was from Genoa. In fact, in several passages he mentions "Antonio Colombo, Genovese, a relative of the Admiral", because that Antonio is a recurring character. That Antonio was one of Columbus' cousins. Diego Col #243;n de Toledo, III Admiral of the Indies, when he had to testify his ancestry in order to get knighted as member of the order of Santiago (1535), reports this about his grandfather: "*He says his grandfather was Don Crist #243;bal Col #243;n, and that he was Genovese, born in Savona, a town close to Genoa*". There is plenty more evidence from all sorts of contemporaries of Columbus accrediting he was genovese, including a number of people from Genoa like Bartolomeo Sen #224;rega, Antonio Gallo, and cardinal Giustiniani. Antonio Gallo would be worth mentioning on its own, as he knew Columbus at a young age, as both lived in the same street in Genoa. Portuguese sources from the time mention Columbus as Ligurian, Genovese, or Italian Oddly enough, the least trustworthy source is Hernando Col #243;n, Columbus' younger son, who very frequently makes stuff up, including making entirely up his father's noble ancestry. His father of humble birth, but was relatively rich thanks in part to his political connections to the Fieschi family. However, at no point does Hernando deny his father being Genovese, in fact he affirms it at different points. The evidence of Columbus being genovese is everywhere, and these examples are nothing but a few, and as chronologically close to the man as possible. Being of humble birth was not an insurmountable barrier for marrying a noblewoman, think of Hernando de Zafra (secretary of the Catholic Monarchs), "of honest plebeian parents" who married a woman of the house of Ayala, one of the oldest and most respected lineages in the whole realm of Castile.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>It very much depends on your definition of North America. Columbus made four journeys to the Indies, basically exploring the greater and the lesser Antilles. Cuba, for example, is definitely an American country, and most definitely in the North. In fact, it is only some 90 miles from the coast of Florida. The same can be said about the Bahamas or Bermuda. All of these countries are normally referred to as being in North America, though not part of the continental mass of North America. Nobody would argue that Great Britain is in Europe despite it not being part of the continental European mass. Then, there is the whole concept of where does North America end. When one talks about the continents, at least in the US as far as I know, America is considered to be divided into two continents: North and South America, and the division line is considered to be the Dari #233;n isthmus. With that definition in hand, Columbus definitely set foot in North America, as in his fourth voyage he explored a good part of Central America, and that would fall within the geographical definition of North America. So, the problem may be with your teacher's really narrow definition of both America and North America. My understanding is that by "America" he means the United States of America, and by North America he means the USA, Canada, and Mexico.</TEXT>

As for the word "cretin", it has nothing to with people from Crete. It comes from the Proven #231;al word "cretin", which itself comes from "crestin", that derives from "christianus". It used to mean a random person, any given man. From that meaning it evolved to mean "idiot". Long story short, the evolution of the meaning was something like "any given man"- gt; any given idiot - gt; idiot. At least that is the etymology proposed by the lexicographer  #201;mile Littr #233; in his Dictionnaire de la Langue Fran #231;aise. It is still up to discussion, though</TEXT>

    <TEXT>ID is compulsory for voting, and three accepted forms of ID for it: DNI (National Identity Document), passport, or driving license, as these three documents have been issued by national authorities. They are easy to get and cheap (12 euros for DNI, 24 for passport, but free if you are unemployed). The document presented to the electoral table can be expired, that is no problem as long the voter is recognisable when compared to the photo on the ID The votes are counted at the polling places, by the members of the electoral tables (1 president and 2 speakers), under the supervision of accredited party reps, or whoever wishes to witness the process. Counting starts at 20:00, when polling stations close. It normally takes a couple hours, as all the numbers have to add up. When the count is finished, the documents consigning the results are filled in, signed by the members of the electoral table. One original copy is pasted on the polling place, the original document is put in Envelope 1 alongside the table's census and other documents, which is taken to the Zone Electoral Board (normally the Courts) by the table's president escorted by the police. Envelope 2 containing original copies of the documents is also carried the president. Envelope 3 is given to the on-duty postman, who carries it to the Electoral Board. The representative of the Administration writes the data into the Interior Ministry's app with the data from Envelope 1 prior to it being closed. By 22:30 the recounts are basically definitive. The process, however, doesn't actually end there. On the third day, the Zone Electoral Board, being composed of 5 justices picked at random, tallies up the data from the documents from the envelopes. With that recount finished (normally on Wednesday by 16:15, I tell you that from experience), the official result from the ZEB is definitive, signed by the justices and the accredited party reps that witnessed the process. The party reps receive copies, of course. Then, the ZEB sends those documents to the Central Electoral Board. 14 days from Election Day, the CEB sends their data to the Ministry, which proceeds to publish them on the State's Official Bulletin. But I insist, by 22:30 on Election Day we have very much the definitive results.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Niego categ #243;ricamente el t #233;rmino "genocidio" referido a la conquista espa #241;ola de Am #233;rica. Primeramente, el genocidio requiere de una voluntad de exterminar a otro grupo humano, y tal cosa no se dio, por un concepto pragm #225;tico. Me explico: Hablamos de soldados y oficiales con una mentalidad propia de su  #233;poca, el feudalismo tard #237;o. Igual que durante la reconquista se premiaba a los oficiales con feudos y repartimientos, los que part #237;an para conquistar las tierras americanas lo hac #237;an con la misma idea: convertirse en se #241;ores de las tierras conquistadas. Con esto en mente, el intentar exterminar a los pobladores es totalmente est #250;pido y contraproducente ya que te quedas sin vasallos que paguen impuestos. No olvidemos que los se #241;or #237;os implicaban muchas cosas, como bien sabe quien haya le #237;do alguna escritura de venta de un feudo, que suele ser del tenor siguiente: "Yo, don Fulano de Tal, se #241;or de esto y lo otro, vendo a vos don Mengano de Cual, se #241;or de aquello y lo de m #225;s all #225;, la villa de VillaPascual con toda su jurisdicci #243;n civil y criminal, alta y baja, mero y mixto imperio, con todas sus rentas, pechos, derechos, aguas estantes, corrientes, y manantes, y derechos que le pertenecen o pertenecer pueden, con sus vasallos, etc". Hern #225;n Cort #233;s, por ejemplo, fue premiado con el marquesado del Valle de Oaxaca, y eso le hac #237;a se #241;or de m #225;s de 20.000 vasallos y 50.000 ducados de renta. Como se #241;ala Gonzalo Fern #225;ndez de Oviedo en sus "Batallas y Quinquagenas" al hablar de un noble aragon #233;s, apunta que 5.000 ducados de renta era buena casa nobiliaria en Arag #243;n y aub en Castilla. Cort #233;s, con su se #241;or #237;o, pas #243; a ser uno de los grandes magnates, s #243;lo por detr #225;s en renta del duque del Infantado y del duque de Medina Sidonia. Los que despu #233;s pasaron a Indias con  #225;nimo militar ten #237;an en la cabeza el convertirse en los nuevos Hern #225;n Cort #233;s.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Bienvenido a clase de Medicina. La desaparici #243;n casi completa de los arawaks, y una mortandad de alrededor del 90% en el continente americano no tiene nada que ver con ning #250;n ansia de exterminio. Los pobladores del continente americano estaban condenados por completo ya milenios antes de que apareciesen los europeos por sus casas. Los habitsntes del Viejo Mundo llevaban miles de a #241;os en contacto con enfermedades que podr #237;amos llamar plagas: viruela, sarsmpi #243;n, gripe, tuberculosis, etc.  #191;Ten #237;an los europeos un mejor sistema inmune? Podr #237;a decirse que s #237;. Durante milenios, los pobladores del Viejo Mundo convivieron con estas enfermedades que proceden de los animales. Estas plagas fueron creando un conjunto gen #233;tico humano resistente a ellas, siendo que los menos fuertes se mor #237;an. Que un virus salte de animales a humanos es muy raro, pero cualquier posibilidad superior a 0 se conviertre en certeza manifiesta si a #241;adimos el factor tiempo. En el Viejo Mundo estaban pr #225;cticamente todos los animales domesticables: gallinas, vacas, perros, gatos, ovejas, cabras, cerdos, caballos, patos, b #250;falos, y poco m #225;s. Los  #250;nicos animales domesticables que ten #237;an en Am #233;rica eran las llamas, los pavos, y una especie de perrillos. La viruela fue responsable de la mayor parte de la ca #237;da de la poblaci #243;n entre 1492 y 1550. En n #250;mero de v #237;ctimas le siguen la gripe, y la salmonela, y si sumamos todas las enfermedades se alcanza un 90% de ca #237;da de la poblaci #243;n entre 1492 y 1550.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Columbus was a nasty piece of work, even by the standards of his time.. His tyrannical rule led to an official investigation by Francisco de Bobadilla, who interrogated 23 witnesses, and there are testimonies that can make anyone shudder. Columbus' tyranny was not specifically against the natives, he was also ruthless against the Spaniards. From Bobadilla's investigation, there arose some awful misdeeds, of which I shall only enumerate a few, but sufficient to characterise the Admiral: \-He had Hernando de Guevara executed, throwing him from the ramparts of the town of Concepci #243;n without due process. Not only that, but Guevara had not even finished confessing the accusations brought against him. \-He had In #233;s de Malver whipped and publicly scorned for having pretended being pregnant in order to get more food from the rationing. \-The slave Luquitas was sentenced to death for stealing wheat. Columbus changed his mind, and had Luquitas' nose and ears cut off, and had the man expelled. \- He had a man nailed to the gates of a church for several days on accusations of libel. \-A woman was punished by Bartholomew Columbus with the usual 100 whiplashes for having said that the Columbus' brothers were of low birth. \-He sold Spaniards into slavery for debts. This last point is particularly relevant, as slavery was more or less a codified institution, and you could not be thrown into slavery for debts. The ordinary state of affairs for being a slave was either be born of slave parents, or be a prisoner of war. And even in the case of prisoners of war there were caveats, as christians could not be enslaved. Bobadilla's inquiry led to Columbus being brought to Spain as a prisoner of the Crown, and being deprived of his titles, honours, and offices. This came in very handy for the Crown, as Columbus basically had the monopoly on the exploration of the Indies. So, with the Chapters of Santa Fe being voided due to the bad faith and trespassing on the terms by Columbus, the Crown could engage in further and more precise exploration of the new lands.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Two things, because I am a nitpicker: - There is one very particular instance in the Spanish language where we use "Americas": the famous expression "hacer las Am #233;ricas". For our non-Spanish speaking fellows, it means emigrating to America and becoming succesful there. A more literal translation would be "making the Americas" or even better "making it in the Americas". - Guanahani may not be correct. It does appear for the first time in Columbus' letter to Sant #225;ngel, printed in 1493 in Barcelona by Pere Posa, but it may be a typo. Don Demetrio Ramos, my mentor's mentor, conclusively proved the manuscript preserved in the Archivo General de Simancas to be from Sant #225;ngel's own hand. By the clear caligraphy and page composition, it is beyond any doubt the draft prepared by Sant #225;ngel for the press. In that manuscript, the name of the island is not Guanahani but Guanabam.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>The Laws of Burgos, and later the Leyes Nuevas, and the Nov #237;ssima Recopilaci #243;n were well intentioned but ineffective, "parchment guarantees" as Thomas Jefferson would say. The Spanish administration never had the manpower to enforce those laws throughout Am #233;rica. I would differ on the willful ignorance part. Probably the only part of the whole system that had any coercitive power were the juicios de residencia, and those could get hard. If there is one example I remember truly well is the residencia of Garc #237;a Hurtado de Mendoza when his tenure as captain general of Chile ended. He was accused of many counts of corruption, embezzlement, unlawful warfare, massacres of civilians, illegal slavery, etc totaling 215 counts. He was found guilty of 198 counts, resulting in him being barred from holding office in Am #233;rica for 20 years, and a fine of 6 million reales.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Admiralty was in and of itself high nobility. So much so, that Columbus requested the title of admiral "with all the prerogatives, rights, and immunities that the late Alfonso Enr #237;quez, Admiral of Castile, had enjoyed". The Admiral of Castile was the most powerful one in the whole Christendom, with civil and criminal jurisdiction, both high and low, mixtum imperium, and while commanding the fleet he was literally "the King's figure" with all its rights. Getting the titles of viceroy and captain general (both hereditary as per the Chapters of Santa Fe) was just about gilding the lily.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>In the early XVI century there are already chroniclers crediting Columbus with discovering a new world. For example, Antonio Gallo (1505) and Bartolomeo Sen #224;rega (1514) talk about Columbus in these terms: *Ii etiam affirmaverunt vera esse quae de insulis nuper repertis a Christophoro Columbo Genuensi dicta feruntur. De quo quia in mentionem devenimus, non ingratum forsitan legentibus addere. Nam aetas nostra illi plurimum debet, qui solus aperuit quod ante per tot secula latuit* **Translation**: It turned out that the information about the islands recently found by Christopher Columbus, Genovese, were true. I mention this because adding it will not be ungrate for the readers. Our age owes him very much, for he alone opened what for all centuries had been hidden. Martin Waldseem #252;ller, for example, credits Columbus with discovering the Antilles in his famous mapa mundi of 1507. I quote: *Iste insule invente sunt per Christophorum Columbum, genuensem, ex mandato regis Castelle* (translation: This islands have been discovered by Christopher Columbus, Genoese, on the King of Castile's command). Christopher Columbus' own son in a very early date (ca. 1506), added a very clear motto to the coat of arms that had been granted to his father in 1493, stating "Por Castilla y por Le #243;n nuevo mundo hall #243; Col #243;n" (for Castile and for Le #243;n, a new world found Col #243;n). However, Amerigo Vespucci was mighty popular in the first years of the XVI century thanks to his own writings, highly embellished though they were, hence why many authors gave Amerigo Vespucci more credit than he was actually due. Sources: SENAREGA, Bartolomeo (1514), *De rebus genuensibus commentaria*. Edition by Emilio Padani (1929) FERNANDEZ DE OVIEDO, Gonzalo (1535), *Historia general y natural de las Indias*.

    <TEXT>Dismissed by every reasonable historian, really. On Waldseem #252;ller's map you can see America written over South America, but you can also notice Amerigo Vespucci portrayed on the upper part of the map, which makes the "Amerike" a non-issue. Vespucci did not find the Brazilian coast, that honour goes to Vicente Y #225; #241;ez Pinz #243;n, who reached the Brazilian coast on January the 26th of the year 1500, discovering the coast between Mucuripe and the island of Trinidad.

Neither did he buy the 3 ships: two of the ships were impounded by the Crown from Diego Rodr #237;guez Prieto and other neighbours of Palos for a debt with the Crown, and the third ship was lent to the Crown by shipwright Juan de la Cosa. An admiral does not necessarily have direct command of a fleet or even any ownership of any vessels, many of the admirals of Castile (a hereditary position in possession of the Enr #237;quez lineage) did not set foot on any ship. They were the supreme commanders of the Castilian fleet, but they delegated their commanding duties on other people. However, the admiralty of Castile came with much more interesting perks, like the civil and criminal jurisdiction over any ports and portuary cities belonging to the Crown, and getting the taxes from said cities (he was paid from those taxes).</TEXT>

    <TEXT>It sounds very classic, I think. In Spain there are three categories in the judiciary: - Judges. - Magistrate judges (all judges become magistrate judges after 4 years of service). - Magistrates of the Supreme Court. They are normally judges by profession, but about 1/5 can come from the prosecutorial career, like Manuel Marchena or Antonio del Moral. Magistrates of the Supreme Court are appointed by the General Council of the Judiciary Power. The GCJP is composed of 20 members: 12 of them are judges or magistrate judges, and 8 are jurists of accredited prestige and merits (notaries, prosecutors, lawyers, professors).</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Very certain. The fact that Peter had scholarly interest on the Qu'ran doesn't diminish the fact that he called Muhammad "pseudopropheta" and included mahommedanism amongst the sects and heresies. That's why Muhammad is pictured like some sort of snake or monster of some kind.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>In this case it means "Or", the second tincture mentioned in the blazon. I would like to mention that it may not necessarily be a fleur de lys, but probably a lily.

    <TEXT>I'm paging /u/KiwiHellenist for this, because "thieves" is a bad translation from Latin, which itself is an imperfect translation of the original Greek. The Greek text reads "leistai", and that is not quite "thieves". A more adequate translation would be "outlaws", "rebels", and such. Lestai is more in the semantic field of sedition than that of theft.</TEXT>
