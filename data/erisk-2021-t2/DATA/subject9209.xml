    <TEXT>I have found it a struggle on DeviantArt. I used to get a lot of response on Google+ but sadly that has now died/is dying. I have never tried Twitter but I think if you can get your head around it, it sounds like it would be worth while. As for Instagram, that's where I find I get the most response but it's a slow build and worth doing the work exploring tags and challenges like the #drawinyourstyle challenge. My friend recommends Pinterest so might be worth looking there but I found Pinterest easier to look for inspiration than post. Artstation is great for a portfolio building but seems to be very advanced so can be quite intimidating if you are a new artist. Hope this helps!</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Sometimes I feel the same and I have to remind myself that you never know someone elses journey, how long they have been learning or how long they spend on their art. There will always be someone better or worse than you. It's a really hard mindset to get into though and it's easy to fall into a habit of becoming disheartened when you see something you feel might be way better than your stuff. Remember that art is for fun primarily and for you, no one else, and that practice and time will make masters of us all.</TEXT>

    <TITLE>Paper weight - Is 200 GSM too thin for an art print?</TITLE>
    <DATE>2020-08-21 10:52:11</DATE>
    <TEXT>Hey there everyone :) I have a printer capable at printing 1200 DPI images on photo paper up to 200 GSM. I have some glossy photo paper 200GSM and matte photo paper 200GSM. I tried 250 but it jammed the printed. I don't make a lot of money on my art and ordering bulk prints when I don't sell much yet always feels expensive. I have done it in the past and they just sit in my drawer. Is 200 GSM too thin for an art print? The photo paper feels nice to hold to me but it isn't as stiff as card. It looks good when I printed it off and the colour really pops but I am worried people would be put off by the paper type. Thanks Kat!</TEXT>
