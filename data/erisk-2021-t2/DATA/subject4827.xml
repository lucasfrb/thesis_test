    <TEXT>Its not Scottish or Welsh independence that scares me, if they want it they should be allowed to have. England is no position to stop them. Im more scared of the way our country is heading with foreign trading and crime. From the looks of it our economy may be swimming in the toilet.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Its incredibly expensive and dangerous to go to the moon. Nasa currently have plans to return to the moon with SLS but compared with their budget in the 60s, its tiny. They would rather make the next step in space travel and go to Mars and allow private companies to gather whats left to research on the moon.</TEXT>
