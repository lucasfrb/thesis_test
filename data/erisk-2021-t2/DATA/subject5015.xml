    <TEXT>I'm really sorry that you had to go though all this, you're amazing for tackling life one day at a time! From what you said, you've always been trying your best to find ways to cope with depression and live life regardless of it. You made it through school, and now college, and congratulations on being engaged! I'm the same age and I'm so proud of what you have achieved despite the hardship. If I went through a tough week like yours I would feel the same way too, nevermind everything else. Sharing what you went through and how you're still up fighting depression is a great encouragement for me and I'm sure others too. I wish you all the best and that one day you can look back at your past self and and be proud of how strong you are.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>This makes so much sense, thanks for sharing! We sometimes have a bad habit of sharing a similarly bad experience to try to show that you relate and understand how bad it feels. But it ends up coming across as selfish and putting the focus on yourself without meaning to. Would definitely try to remember this next time</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Stove top apple crumble: - Cook some cubed apples, sugar, cinnamon and a little water in a pot until apples are at desired softness - tip: experiment with other spices like cloves, ground ginger etc. And try using brown sugar for deeper flavour - Put oats, flour, sugar and room temperature butter in a bowl, then rub them between your fingers until you get a crumbly mixture - Toast the mixture in a pan until lightly browned and it smells like cookies - Serve in a bowl with as much or little crumble as you like over the apples - tip: add a dollop of yogurt or scoop of ice cream to serve - make a big batch of crumble to sprinkle over desserts like ice cream</TEXT>

    <TEXT>These are your experiences and feelings, others going through worse or your age do not change how your friends make you feel. You sound like a lovely friend, but friendships take both parties to work. I hope your friends realise that you can only be there for them and support them for so long before you are exhausted and drained from it. If they're don't start treating you properly as a friend, they'll lose you one day.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I have little to no control over my emotions. I get upset and cry instinctively when faced with conflict, I won't do anything until it's too late because I wasn't "stressed enough". Most days are just foggy. I feel so useless and helpless and scared that I'll lose everything. It's like my past has set me up for eventual failure and I'm just stick with bad coping mechanisms.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Queen's gives monthly updates on which companies have offers, then you do the work to apply. You start looking for placement at the start of second year, but some people including myself didn't secure one until around summer. If you applied to over 20 companies and didn't get excepted you have the option to skip the placement year, but I wouldn't recommend it.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>One thing I noticed is that those who enter the course with good programming skills tend to struggle with the theory. Not like understanding them, but just having to remember the material during tests. Google and YouTube will definitely help more than most lectures. Most professors are happy to help and answer questions and some have hour slots open for students to go in for help. Unfortunately there's a huge number of computer science/software engineering students at Queens, so if you don't reach out, you won't get the help.</TEXT>

I don't feel in control of my feelings. A small thing can trigger memories of the past and it adds on top of the traumatic memory. Everything feels like trauma.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I'm so sick of myself. I'm a terrible person, with little to no compassion. Im selfish and don't care enough about my loved ones to do anything for them. All I care about is how much pain I'm in and how much guilt I feel for being a bad person. I want to get better so badly and yet feel so lost and hopeless about it. I'm always either crippled with all the negative feelings and all the bad that I've done, or trying to push it back and pretend I'm okay so I can get on with daily stuff like work. When I face my problems I just want to die, when I push it back I revert to the same selfish person and I hate it. If anyone has tips about getting therapy in UK, or how to tackle issues in therapy that would be nice. I feel trapped feeling like this, it's stopping me from seeing any good in life. I'm sick of it and sick of myself. I know I can't kill myself because it will bring more hurt to people around me, but I can't help but think that I bring out the worst in people closest to me and they're better off without me. I don't want to think like this but I do. Help.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I've been so selfish and causing so much pain to my partner. He's said it many times before - I've broken him. I've chipped away his love for me. The only reason to why he's still with me is that I might kill myself if he leaves. I don't mean it as a threat, but I honestly don't know what I'll do if even the most kind and patient person I know gives up on me. I've always said I'll change but I'm just always the same. I've started therapy but there's so much crap behind my bad habits and all. He says I don't care about him and I never listen. But in my head and heart I always have. I can't tell how I feel anymore. If I really do care about him why am I still like this? If I really love him enough surely I'll be better already. The conclusion is that even if I'm not aware of it, I'm selfish and don't care about anyone else, my feelings matter more than theirs. I don't even realise what I'm doing, how am I going to fix it? I can't get better and I probably won't because I'm so selfish. I don't even know if I care anymore, I don't know how I feel. I don't think I can do this I just want to give up</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Indoor bouldering - Boulderworld Belfast. They have taster sessions for anyone interested and you can rent climbing shoes and that's about all you need to get started. It's a great solo sport but most climbers there are quite friendly and would chat or help you if you need a bit of guidance. It's not competitive but can be if you want want to. It exercises your whole body, helps with flexibility and there's an element of problem solving too.</TEXT>

Nothing will change and I'll never make it up to them. Feels so hopeless like I was set up to fail but it's my own fault.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I was raised by my grandparents and my granny was very strict and would shout at me and hit me. I'm all grown up now but I can't deal with conflict. When my partner and I have arguments I get this fight or flight reaction. I either try to end the argument by just ignoring my side of things and agreeing with him, or get heated and angry and full of hate. Both makes my partner angry and frustrated and over time he learned that getting physical like shoving and hitting lightly is the way to get me to listen. He says he would never hit me, like hard enough to hurt or anything. But even light taps make me stressed and scared and want to fight back, physically. I feel like I'm stuck in the past, I always deserve to be hurt because I mess up, I start fights instead of being normal. I'm either feeling like a helpless child again or becoming the one who is angry and shouting and hitting. Either way I'm just reliving my past and I hate it. I hate myself. I can't have a normal relationship I can't be normal. I don't know if I'm making any sense I'm just so ready to give up. It's like I'll never get away or move on from my past, it'll always haunt me and make me a worse person.</TEXT>
