    <TITLE>Full or Partial suit?</TITLE>
    <DATE>2016-05-23 08:48:37</DATE>
    <TEXT>I'm kinda new to the fandom, well, I've been a long time anthro fan, but I only really started considering myself a furry once I decided I want a fursuit. I don't know if it's just me, but I've noticed that when people talk about fursuits and fursuit making, and they talk about whether you should have a full or partial, it's always worded as if a full suit should eventually be your end goal, or like if you can't get a full suit for whatever reason, a partial is "the next best thing" rather than an equal alternative. I'm just wondering if I'm just noticing something that isn't there, or if there is a small bias against partial suits. It's also like, people in full suits tend to be more popular than those in partials. I'm wondering if others have noticed the same thing? Also, weather or not you have a suit, or even want one, you've probably got a preference - What do you prefer the look of? Partial or full? Personally, I prefer the look of full suits but if I'm not sure if I would wear a full suit or a partial with a fish patterned kaftan that I own but have never worn. I'm leaning towards partial, also because I have to make it myself (unfortunately)</TEXT>

    <TITLE>What world/reality does your fursona(s) live in?</TITLE>
    <DATE>2016-05-30 08:00:46</DATE>
    <TEXT>Talking with a friend got me thinking about this last night. Obviously in our reality, there are no anthros, there are only people and animals. But for your 'sona to exist, they need to exist *somewhere*. In your mind, even if they live in a world just like ours, it's different somehow. What are those differences? They could be from another planet. What's the planet like, are there other anthro races or humans there? Maybe it's a fantasy reality where humans never existed, and all the anthro races live normal human lives, just with added fur, scales and feathers? What is ***your*** reality? For Susim, she lives in a weird reality where there are animals, there are humans, and there are "pets" who are anthro. "Pets" are treated by humans, their owners, mostly as pets, or like some people in our reality treat their pets, like children. Kind of like stewie from family guy, the owners will hear their pet saying something, but they won't really take notice unless it's really simple, like "I'm hungry, I'm sad, I'm bored, I love you" Even adult pets tend to act like perpetual teenagers, because they're very rarely given any responsibility or true freedom. There are some "pets" living in the world independently, and the owners call them strays. Owners are annoyed by them, but often they're idolised by pets who wish for a free life, but are too scared to leave their comfortable life been cared for. Susim doesn't want to be a stray (she loves her owner) but she likes hanging out with strays occasionally, when she escapes the house.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Does anyone else here play, or has ever played furcadia? I've been playing on and off for over 10 years (literally scares the fuck out of me to type that. Man, I'm getting old) What's your most memorable experience on the game? ~ For me, it was that time that I'm not so proud about... I was 14 or 15 (possibly 13, I don't really remember), and I met a guy, who was 19, his name was Kiyo White Fox and we got close. I told him I was 17. He role-play kissed me, and I told him the truth and he was... understandably hurt. He wouldn't talk to me after that but I never forgot him. Kiyo, I was ShayFox and if you happen to be on this reddit, and read this - I'm sorry. No excuses, I'm just so sorry.</TEXT>

    <TITLE>Orcish wedding ceremonies.</TITLE>
    <DATE>2016-08-11 10:50:56</DATE>
    <TEXT>The Elder Scrolls games have been part of our relationship since the beginning. We're planning to marry in about 2 years and are still considering themes, but Elder Scrolls is at the top of the list, and the idea is to blend marriage conventions from our two favourite races. My partner generally plays as, and enjoys the culture of Nords, but we know their wedding conventions through Skyrim. (and a little from ESO) I, on the other hand, strongly identify as an Orc (character wise). I know the strongholds ship off their girls and the chief has a bunch of wives and stuff, but does anyone know what an actual wedding ceremony in a stronghold looks like? I can't imagine the girl just rocks up to her new stronghold and the chief is like "hey" and that's it. There must be some kind of 'event'. So far we only have what they've got in common, snow, ale and fighting. But what are the differences? I've googled around a bit and can't really find anything, but most probably I just suck at it, please help me! Thank you!</TEXT>

    <DATE>2017-05-09 10:27:13</DATE>
    <TEXT>I don't know if I've just overdosed on other peoples bad wedding experiences and I'm just trying to shut that shit down before it happens to us, but the other day my FH's mother kept bringing up moving the date "to make things easier for guests who work" after I'd repeatedly told her the date was important to us. Honestly it's the *most* important thing about the wedding, to us. I do understand what she means, it's on a monday and if people want to come to the ceremony AND the reception, and stay late and drink they'll probably have to book those two days off. But honestly we didn't even *want* a reception, my FH just couldn't say no to his mum's offer of financial help (but that's another matter...) I basically told her if people didn't think our wedding was important enough to book a day off (we're in the UK, everyone gets a minimum amount of holidays by law so no excuses there, and the wedding is just under a year away so plenty of time to book ahead) then why would we want them there at all? and that the wedding is one day, but the date will be our anniversary forever. Now I just feel mean, she means well, she's actually really nice, she's such a "mum" you know what I mean? like she just wants to make everyone happy all the time, and I know she wasn't trying to start anything or take over, but until now me and FH had planned everything ourselves and were happy but now we're having a proper reception and ceremony and it's so stressful. I don't want to become a "bridezilla" because I can't handle stress. I wish we could just go back and say no, but I've already invited my out of town family, and they're super excited (and I'm actually really excited to see them too now), and they wont be able to come if we go back to our original plans, and I think his parents would take it personally and know it was coming from me (they already think I don't like them because I don't come with my partner when he visits them, but I do like them, I just have agoraphobia and leaving the house is painfully hard) My friends said I was in the right for setting boundaries but my partner thinks it was a little harsh and I should have just waited until he could talk to her (even though he hasn't spoken to her at all in the last 2 weeks since he flipped all our previous planning on it's head.) Do you think I was too harsh?</TEXT>

    <TITLE>Random boob growth in mid 20s?</TITLE>
    <DATE>2017-05-10 14:57:26</DATE>
    <TEXT>First, I haven't gained any weight, in fact I've lost an inch off my waist somehow, so it's not that. Just under a month ago, I had *really* bad breast tenderness. In general I don't get breast tenderness every period, maybe three or four times a year and it's usually just a little sore, but this was almost unbearable. they also felt heavier and denser than normal. Because of some other irregularities, I thought I might be pregnant, but it turned out I wasn't. My period came and my boobs just stopped hurting. But since then, while the band fits exactly the same, I'm literally spilling out of my bra. I only got it a few months ago and it fit perfect when I got it, so the difference is very obvious. I'm already a 38K, I don't think I can handle getting bigger. I'm not on hormonal birth control, and my diet and exercise levels haven't changed. Does anyone know what could have caused random growth? Or is this just something that happens in mid 20s? Do I need to worry about further growth?</TEXT>

    <TEXT>So, pretty much the only things that are set in stone right now are the rings, date and my aisle song. You know, the song I'll be walking down the aisle to. I didn't want the traditional wedding march, and being a gamer my entire life, I'm walking down the aisle to one of my favourite instrumental pieces from one of my favourite games. ["Build 4" from The Sims](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbA58yOhPH4) I love it because even if you never played the game, it's still just a nice piano piece. To me, it sounds so hopeful. It means a lot to me (I spent many a year building my dream house and making my future family to this song), and honestly it was the first song I thought of when trying to decide. **I want to know what you guys are planning to walk to! Does it have sentimental value? Do you just like the song? Are you keeping it traditional and having the ever classic march?** It's a little embarrassing (and according to my FH "creepy") but when I'm wedding planning I've just got it on repeat in the back ground. It keeps me focused! ETA: Extra question from yeahyeahsuresuree: are you guys using the instrumental version of the songs or the version with lyrics?</TEXT>

    <TITLE>Things I've learned about weddings from this sub about weddings.</TITLE>
    <DATE>2017-05-12 13:01:36</DATE>
    <TEXT>Like the title says, here are some things I'd never heard of before coming to this sub. 1. Engagement photo shoots are a thing. 2. Brides maids proposal boxes. 3. That save the date cards aren't just another name for invitations, but actually separate cards entirely, that are sent before invitations. 4. Favours for the guests?? Most of my ignorance was because I've only ever been to one wedding, and it was a 2nd/3rd marriage between two over middle aged people, and they did everything super cheap and didn't bother with most traditions and stuff like that. So many things "outside" of the wedding that go into a wedding that I had no idea about! Who else learned things they didn't know from this sub? Or, on the flip side, what have you found yourself explaining to people about wedding planning and options that they had no idea about before? My FH had no idea wedding cupcakes were an option until we started talking about the cake!</TEXT>

    <TITLE>Dress and breasts question</TITLE>
    <DATE>2017-05-15 13:19:18</DATE>
    <TEXT>I'm a 38K, Built-in-bras are just not a thing for people at my size. In my mind I imagine having to wear my bra under my dress because I don't know how sturdy the bodice of a wedding dress is, so that means like 90% of dresses are off the table for me because they're either sleeveless/strapless or off the shoulder, or halterneck, and my bra straps will show. Normally I don't care about bra straps but this is a formal occasion, it's just not appropriate and I know I'd feel self conscious about it. Not to mention how uncomfortable it will be, my bra cuts in as it is and I can't wear it without pain for more than a few hours, i'm going to be in my dress at least 10 hours, with the dress adding pressure to that. My question is mainly directed at other brides who are both plus size and have boobs bigger than a G - Were you able to go braless with your dress? did you find the girls slipping down, falling out, or looking misshapen? This is the one thing that's been playing on my mind, because I'm not going to be able to dress shop for a few months yet, so I just want an idea of what do expect? are wedding dress bodices more like corsets? or so they just do that useless thing where they sew "cups" into the dress?</TEXT>

    <DATE>2017-06-05 19:50:59</DATE>
    <TEXT>Hi, my partner and I decided on a whim to attempt cauliflower rice tonight, but we have no steamer or anything like that. We also don't want to have to add lots of stuff to it either, I've been watching videos but we don't have any coconut oil or onions or vegetable stock. Basically we barely have the basics. We have one frying pan and two saucepans, that's it. We have a bullet blender so getting the cauliflower into "rice form" will be fine, we just have no idea what to do with it after that. I'm kinda worried about boiling it, because i don't want it to get too soft. can we have it raw? will it even taste ok? I've never tasted it before so I don't know what to expect. I thought I'd ask Vegan Food because obviously, if anyone knows how to make vegetables taste great and prepare it in inventive and exiting ways, it's you guys! We're going to have it in place of normal rice with our vegetable curry, if that helps?</TEXT>

    <TITLE>Anyone know a site i can hire a driver with a car to transport a mangy dog?</TITLE>
    <DATE>2018-01-15 13:42:59</DATE>
    <TEXT>A family friend just died and left his elderly dog behind. After painful consideration we've decided it would be best to have her euthanized, as she's very old and sick herself, and we don't want to send her to a shelter just for her to die alone. Problem is, we don't have a car, or know anyone with a car who is willing to take her, and I don't blame them. She was poorly looked after and has flees, mites and god knows what else, and she's not house trained and likely to mess in the car, due the the stress and grief she is currently experiencing. She's too poorly to walk there, and too big to be carried. I've looked online and obviously most drivers for hire aren't equipped to take a dog like this, they can't afford to risk their car getting all smelly and flea'd up. If anyone knows a website or maybe a charity that can help me find a car (and a driver - none of us can drive so we can't just hire a car) that will take an animal, it would be amazing. In the bristol area, just from southmead to filton, and obviously, only a one way trip needed. **ETA**: Thank you so much for the suggestions, but I eventually found a pet taxi and they were brilliant and it wasn't very expensive. We were able to get her in tonight, save another night alone. She's gone now, but in the moment she was loved and she was comfortable on the journey there. **ETA2**: Because someone asked and incase anyone else was wondering, to save having the rifle through the comments, the pet taxi I used was was [Shaun's Doggy Day Care and Pet Care Services](http://shaunsdoggydaycareandpetcare.co.uk/).</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Sorry if this isn't the right sub, but I thought someone here might recognise what I'm going to describe. When I was a kid, I had these t-shirts all from the same "brand", most of them had a cartoon girl on the front, but some of them had the same girl with a boy, one maybe holding hands, another they were kissing, and if I remember correctly, the ones where she was alone usually had a word under it, and i think it was the name of the brand, it either was, or a synonym for "beautiful", like gorgeous, or glamorous. The girl and boy looked exactly the same, only the girl had long hair and eyelashes. they had a big head, with tall oval eyes that had a line through to make eyelids (think Jessica rabbit). their body was about as big as their head and from what i remember, they were always naked, but had no anatomy. I drew a [really crappy reference](https://i.imgur.com/P2ypK5N.png) from memory, hopefully it'll help. Thank you!</TEXT>

    <DATE>2018-05-04 19:56:26</DATE>
    <TEXT>I've had a look online and all I can find is mannequin wigs and real people's wigs turned into sim hair. What I'm looking for, is if anyone has made the maxis hair as hats. I don't want anything special, like if you're wearing long hair and put on a short "wig" the hair will show under - I want it to be like the headscarf, in that it replaces the hair. I want it because I'm doing an Egyptian themed neighbourhood, and want them to wear black "wigs" but don't want them to go to bed and swim in their wigs, but because the hair colour you pick is the same for every hairstyle (obviously), this means their short hair, that is supposed to be their natural hair colour, will also be black, even if it's a sim who is supposed to have lighter hair. Is there such a thing out there? Thank you.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>For the longest time I played in pve servers but thought I #8217;d give pvp a go. I quickly figured out that it was easier to just not have doors, because building destruction time is when I #8217;m offline. Rather than give people a reason to smash my base up trying to get in, they can just come in and take what they want, so I go to bed, and hope I don #8217;t wake up naked in the desert. I thought that was going to be the norm, but it actually hasn #8217;t happened yet. I #8217;ve been playing for a couple of weeks now, without a clan, and some days I wake up and a some of my things are gone (like iron weapons, hardened stone, stuff like that) and others I wake up and everything but my clothes is gone, but so far, they have all left me alive, and they #8217;ve not smashed my base up at all. But what I really wanted to talk about, is how today I woke up, and instead of *missing* things, someone had given me stuff! They gave me a full set of high level armour, a weapon and a bunch of resources like iron and hardened stone, and a level 3 tanner! I went around my base, checking all my stations, it was like Christmas and I #8217;m not exaggeration when I say this, but I almost cried. It #8217;s so nice and so unexpected. I #8217;ve never experienced this level of generosity on any game I #8217;ve played before. For a game that is supposed to be dog eat dog, the community is so fair, it #8217;s really amazing. Thank you to those mystery gifters and in the future when I #8217;m max level, I #8217;ll pass it forward.</TEXT>

    <DATE>2018-11-29 11:48:00</DATE>
    <TEXT>I know this isn't *directly* related to Love Nikki, but I recently started playing a new phone game that i think many Love Nikki fans would love, if they're not already playing. It's called Royal Chaos. ^^^^^(it ^^^^has ^^^^a ^^^^subreddit ^^^^if ^^^^anyone ^^^^is ^^^^interested ^^^^r/royalchaos) It's like Love Nikki in some ways, different in others. Like Love Nikki, there is paid content but you can earn pay currency in-game at a slower rate. It's got the fashion aspect, there are outfits to craft and collect, but also some fighting (kind of, it auto attacks but you are responsible for recruiting, arranging, equipping and leveling your "team"), and other mini games, like romancing the emperor. Also you can play as male, or female! And i haven't tried it yet but I've heard you can have more than one character on different servers too. it was a little confusing to get into but you get used to it, and the tutorials are very helpful. If anyone here is a fan of the Chinese historical drama Empresses in the Palace, it reminds me very strongly of that. I had so much fun on it last night I nearly forgot to log into Love Nikki before bed for the first time since I started playing almost a year ago. I'm not trying to steal players from love nikki though, just be be clear - I just know i'd appreciate it if i didn't know about this game and someone from here introduced me. **Has anyone else got any suggestions for games that Love Nikki fans might enjoy**? Doesn't have to be a Love Nikki clone but just any games you play that have the same feel or aesthetics, or maybe similar mechanics.</TEXT>

I think it would be interesting, and give a new spin on being male, if when a female gives birth, the closest (maybe within 3 tiles either direction) unrelated male was the childs father, or better yet, if there were some kind of marriage system that meant all children after that were that mans child (like the naming system, but one person says "marry me" and the other unrelated, opposite sex person has to reply "i do" and now they're married - all children after that have the male listed as father and now they have 2 "eves" in their family tree. This will be interesting because now, males will have to make a choice - stay and help their birth family, or go and find an unrelated tribe once old enough to start their own family. (and like real life, males can father children from puberty to death by old age) It could also incentivise tribes in general to seek each other out and live together.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I don #8217;t just mean any of the NPCs, I mean the ones specifically labelled  #8220;villager #8221;. They seem to come in two outfits, dressed like Lulu and Serge, or dressed in a blue and white  #8220;Arabian #8221; inspired outfit. What do they do? Farmers tend to crops, nuns prepare and serve food, elders fish and children are cute. The villagers don #8217;t seem to do anything, besides build, but everyone does that. I thought they might cook but they don #8217;t. I gave them all personal kitchens but none of them would take food out of the chest and cook, other than the nuns. I had to open up all their houses and make their kitchens public so the nuns would come around and cook food and drink for everyone. If they won #8217;t even cook for themselves or help with the farming, what #8217;s the point in having them on my buildertopia at all? There doesn #8217;t seem to be any benefits.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>My cat, who I love so very much, caught a bird. The poor thing is still alive. She brought it into the house, which isn't really a problem, other than the fact that the bird was(is) bleeding. We got it away from my cat, but obviously now i have a bird, that's not dead so i can't just throw it away, and is obviously injured so I can't just release it. Luckily the RSPCA are gonna come pick it up, but i don't know when that's going to be, so i'm just waiting. Which is why i'm pissed. I'm agoraphobic, which means i don't leave the house very often, and almost never by myself - but today, i was planning to do just that, and go to shops by my house. I got dressed. I've been planning this for almost a week. and now, because of my cat, i am confined to the house until the RSPCA get here, which can be any time between now and 9PM. HOW FUCKING IRONIC!</TEXT>

At first i thought she'd been killed so I checked the family tree, she's still alive - just gone! I guess she was black bagged?? Sims 3 is wild.</TEXT>

    <DATE>2020-01-27 19:09:40</DATE>
    <TEXT>Until tonight. I #8217;m going to introduce him to jreg, starting with  #8220;stop sexualising me #8221;. My husband is a filthy centrist so hopefully with help from jreg, I can save him from the centricide. Pray for me. Will update with his reaction. **Update:** I asked him what he thought about  #8220;stop sexualising me #8221; and he just said  #8220;I know *you* liked it. #8221; And further added  #8220;it was cool he wasn #8217;t a dick about it #8221; (as in, he #8217;s being a good sport about being sexualised) Then I showed him the centricide videos, and I asked him his thoughts and he said it makes him feel stupid because he didn #8217;t know what was going on. I asked him his favourite character (I told him it didn #8217;t have to be his actual ideology) and he said  #8220;the yellow one #8221; and when I asked him why he said  #8220;because he can buy anything #8221; Then I asked him if he considers himself a centrist, he said  #8220;does *jreg* consider himself a centrist? He makes fun of everyone else but not the centrists... #8221; Blasphemy. Clearly grounds for divorce. I asked him which ideology he fits into best and be said  #8220;I don #8217;t care, I #8217;m too depressed. #8221; I asked him what he thought about jreg videos as a whole and he said  #8220;he talks too fast, and says too many big words, and I don #8217;t understand #8221; I told him I was going to post this and asked if he had anything to add and he said:  #8220;after this conversation I feel dumb. #8221; He wouldn #8217;t say anything else. Thank you for reading. I #8217;ll read any and all replies to my husband, and get him to answer any questions.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>**Edit: It was a bug! After resetting the server it was fixed!** I #8217;m not going to delete this though, just incase it happens to someone else and they search it up.  #8212; #8212; #8212; Me, husband, bro-in-law and another friend were all playing together in multiplayer, and they all had male avatars and I had a female avatar. We all tried logging and for some reason I couldn #8217;t pick up the logs - and no, it wasn #8217;t because they were too heavy - the others were able to pick up the same logs. At first I thought it was just a glitch, and my husband joked that it was because I was a girl avatar. I changed to a male avatar and was able to pick up logs - we thought that was funny, but mostly I thought  #8220;maybe the glitch is fixed now because I logged out #8221; I changed back to a female avatar, and the problem returned. I couldn #8217;t even pick up tiny chunks. When I click pick up, it moves slightly and just drops. By this point I felt like that it was more than a coincidence. Curious if it was just me, my bro-in-law and our friend both logged out and came back as female avatars. Suddenly they were unable to lift logs either. One person is funny. 3 people is a pattern. This must be on purpose. Anyone else notice/able to replicate this?? On PS4.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>For some people it really is free. I grew up in a very poor home filled with sickness and none of us paid any tax but we didn #8217;t die because of it. It was free for us, even though we hadn #8217;t paid into it. These days I #8217;m lucky enough to be in a home that earns enough to pay into it and I #8217;m grateful. Also it #8217;s such a stupid thing to say. If someone said  #8220;I can call the fire brigade for free! #8221; You wouldn #8217;t be like  #8220;... free at the point of service!! #8221; Because you *expect* fire services to be  #8220;free #8221;. You can say the same about ANYTHING paid for by taxes. The only people who complain about taxes paying for schools and roads are crazy ass libertarians. Have you ever called public schools  #8220;free at the point of service #8221;? No? Because they are accepted as being  #8220;free #8221;. People in countries that don #8217;t hate their people mean  #8220;free #8221; the same way when they say free. No need to correct them.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>It #8217;s not a misconception though. People *know* it #8217;s paid with taxes. People understand that when they #8217;re saying free. Again, people call all public services free, but understand it #8217;s paid for with taxes. You don #8217;t need to say  #8220;at point of service #8221;. Whether you mean to or not, it #8217;s term commonly used by people who are trying to dismiss  #8220;free #8221; healthcare by scaring them with taxes. Doesn #8217;t work so well on people who are already used to it but generally it #8217;s used to scare Americans who are still on the fence about it. Like  #8220;oOoOo it #8217;s not free, it #8217;s going to mean higher tAaAxes!!! #8221; Again maybe you #8217;re not out to scare people, but you #8217;re adding nothing to the conversation. Again, people who already receive it understand what is meant by  #8220;free #8221;. You #8217;re just being pedantic. And it honestly comes off as an anti-free healthcare dog whistle.

    <TEXT>You have it backwards. Christianity is a fucked up backwards religion that some good people have fallen for - not the other way around. I do believe there are many good people who happen to be Christian, but I don #8217;t believe they #8217;re good because of Christianity, but more rather in spite of it. Religion is a tool and often an excuse. Good people do good things and say  #8220;I did it because god said it #8217;s the right thing to do! #8221; but a bad person will do something bad and say  #8220;I did it because god said it #8217;s the right thing to do! #8221; And going by the bible, they might both be right. How can a religion be good if it #8217;s god explicitly condones slavery, rape and murder? There is nothing you can say to excuse the damage Christianity has inflicted on the world. The fact that some people do good things in the name of god means nothing - only that even indoctrinated people have the capacity find goodness even in the most disgusting of books.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>This is untrue - a myth. The muscles behind your breasts are worked out the same way men #8217;s pecs are. They will atrophy if you don #8217;t use your arms/chest muscles. Your breasts will sit higher which will make them look perkier, but if they are past a certain size, bra, or lack of one, isn #8217;t going to make much difference at all, visually. What makes breast  #8220;saggy #8221; is age, weight fluctuation, bodily changes after pregnancy, and just your natural breast shape - some women have naturally low nipple placement that make their breasts look saggy, some women fat distribution that makes them look like they hang lower. These things can #8217;t be helped. Bras do not do anything to breast shape. They are entirely make of fat and breast tissue. Someone with very strong chest muscles can have saggy breasts, and someone with atrophied chest muscles can have perky looking breasts. Again, bras have little to no impact on this.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>**TL;DR: 14/15 with a 22 year old. Only broke up because he was was always talking down About himself which was emotionally exhausting.** I was 14, me and my friends made dating profiles on something like plenty of fish or something - this was before tinder. Obviously I had to say I was older and put that I was 19. (I know now that was a dick thing to do) The point of making the accounts was basically to practice flirting safely, but mostly so we could share the weird shit men said to us (secretly). The plan was never to actually build a relationship with any of these men - but I met a 22 year old guy who I *thought* was really nice, but in hindsight, he was actually just kind of pathetic, and being 14, I confused pity for affection. So at first it was very innocent, so I didn #8217;t feel too guilty about lying about my age, but then we got a little closer and I finally admitted I was 14 (I was nearly 15) and he was understandably upset. Now, if the story ended here, it would be a story about an asshole teen who catfished a lonely guy. But it doesn #8217;t end there. At first he said we should stop, but being a child who thought she was feeling love for the first time, I asked him to reconsider. I said something like  #8220;you believed I was 19, so obviously I #8217;m mature for my age, and it #8217;s my birthday soon! #8221; And he agreed to continue our relationship. Age of consent is 16 here and we agreed that he would wait for me. He should have just said no and if I persisted, blocked me. I would have HATED him at the time, but I would have understood by the time I was his age. Our relationship remained online. We didn #8217;t live far from each other and were planning to meet, but (luckily) things kept coming up. Things obviously turned sexual over time. I didn #8217;t have a webcam and this was before smart phones so luckily I never ended up sending nude photos or videos or anything, but he masturbated on camera at least once. It didn #8217;t creep me out at the time, I enjoyed it because I wasn #8217;t aware of the context of it all. We spoke to each other very explicitly and we spoke on the phone a few times (couldn #8217;t do that often because adults were around and might hear) As I mentioned before he was kinda pathetic. He was one of those guys who would put himself down so that I would be like  #8220;aww, no, you #8217;re not those things, you #8217;re great, and I love you! #8221; And I didn #8217;t realise how emotionally draining it was at first, to constantly be boosting his ego. Then some shit went down in my home (you didn #8217;t think a teen girl dating an adult man came from a stable home, did you?) and I went to go live with my dad (who I had literally just spent time with for the first time since I was 9). This put me even further away. It was around this time, after about 5 months of being together, that I started to notice how draining being with him was. I still cared about him but I was getting frustrated with his constant self deprecation. My heart would drop when I saw he was online because I knew it was either just going to be depressing or horny -usually both. I didn #8217;t mind horny, but not when I knew it was just going to end with me talking him up again. Also he had lied about something kind of small but when I caught him out he got defensive and that really just put a bad taste in my moth about everything he #8217;d told me. I also had depression at the time and it was really impacting me. Beyond this, my friends implied that a boy from school, a boy I had a crush on for years, might like me Not even confirmation, just that he *might* like me. I had already become friendly with him since moving (I got everyone #8217;s details before moving schools) So I took this as my out. Before I made any move on this other boy, I told my boyfriend that I didn #8217;t want to be with him anymore. I can #8217;t remember exactly how the conversation went but I know I blamed him always being negative and making me feel bad, I remember saying like word for word  #8220;I #8217;m 15 years old! I shouldn #8217;t have to deal with this! #8221; And he asked me if there was someone else and I didn #8217;t want to lie so I was upfront about the fact that I was planning to try things with a boy my own age. We argued and the last thing he said was  #8220;don #8217;t message me again unless you #8217;re single #8221;. Then he blocked me. (I #8217;m married to the other boy now) But yeah. I #8217;m just really lucky we never met up because just before I moved (which was very spur of the moment, I literally had an argument and was gone the next day) we were finally planning to meet properly, like we had a date and everything, and we were 100% planning to have sex. At the time I thought it was great and I felt so adult. By the time I was 22 I realised how gross it was. It #8217;s fucked up to me that I only broke up with him because he was depressing, and not because he was a 22 year old going out with 15 year old. Ew.</TEXT>

She said her mum used to hit her with it, and she hit her kids with it, and o can #8217;t remember if if was her mum hitting her that made it split, or my nan hitting one of her kids, but they used to tell the story like it was normal and laugh about it and stuff. She would *threaten* to hit me with it but she never did. She just used her fists instead.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I have been too, I think we underestimate how much we #8217;re affected by everything we #8217;ve been seeing and going through. First covid - that shit was/is legit frightening. Now this? We all knew there was a chance police would react like this, but anticipating something doesn #8217;t always prepare you for the reality. We #8217;re literally watching fascism in action. I #8217;m not even American but it terrifies me, because if Trump goes full hitler, I don #8217;t know what my country will do. Will we go to war? Will they just ignore it? The riots won #8217;t stop at America and the police will probably start taking cues from American police. It #8217;s a selfish reason to be scared but I #8217;m just being honest. But beyond those selfish thoughts, I do have so much empathy for the people in the middle of these protests right now. Every video I see of someone getting tazed, shot, beaten, gassed - it makes my heart physically ache and I feel sick. I #8217;ve been trying to stay away but then I feel guilty for ignoring the trouble. It is normal for all this to be getting to you, even if you #8217;re not always thinking about it. I can #8217;t imagine how the things I #8217;m feeling must be magnified for those actually in America. There #8217;s been no time to take a breath. Of course we #8217;re all stressed and anxious.</TEXT>

Even if he WAS born in Kenya, he would have still been eligible!! Edit: ah! I read further down that it was a LIE and the president does have to be born there. Still a stupid, racist conspiracy theory though, like what the fuck, does he even have any connection to Kenya or did they just pick a random African country? Edit again, because I #8217;m learning today: Obama #8217;s dad is from Kenya so not totally out of the blue. But still racist, like his mum didn #8217;t know he #8217;d one day be president, how would she have the forethought not to just register him in Kenya an then get him a dual citizenship when they went back to Hawaii (like the conspiracy theorists claim). It #8217;s so stupid.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Calling out edgy teens teaches them there are spaces where racism won #8217;t be tolerated. Whether they grow out of I it or double down and become  #8220;actual #8221; racists doesn #8217;t matter. What matters is making public spaces free of blatant bigotry,  #8220;ironic #8221; or not.

Your racism isn #8217;t contained in that one area, that #8217;s not how this shit works. If You call someone the nword in world of Warcraft, you said that to a real person, who might even be black. Is that ok in your eyes? Because it was over a game? Because I see game chat as no different than a phone call. Would you call a stranger a faggot over the phone?

    <TEXT>Racism is different here. It #8217;s more insidious, I think. I think people are even less aware of their own racism here than they are in America. You know the woman who did the  #8220;[blue eyes, brown eyes](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jane_Elliott) #8221; experiment in the 60 #8217;s? She came and did a special show here, and watching it was... It was disgusting. Almost every white person was upset about it and REFUSED to learn anything. Even the white people on the brown eyes side were defending the feelings of the blue eyes team, and literally just ignoring everything the people of colour were telling them. It was a failure. It didn #8217;t work. Those white people left feeling like victims - but not in the way they were supposed to. I #8217;m white, and grew up in a majority white area. I felt fucking ashamed. Also no surprise that the loudest of the white complainers were obviously middle class (UK=rich). It was just that peanut on the shit cake. My point is, I think a lot of Americans who are ignorant, are more willing to learn. White British people are more likely to double down and deny.

    <TEXT> #8220;[blue eyes, brown eyes](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jane_Elliott) #8221; A summary:  gt;Elliott divided her class by eye color  #8212; those with blue eyes and those with brown. On the first day, the blue-eyed children were told they were smarter, nicer, neater, and better than those with brown eyes. Throughout the day, Elliott praised them and allowed them privileges such as a taking a longer recess and being first in the lunch line. In contrast, the brown-eyed children had to wear collars around their necks and their behavior and performance were criticized and ridiculed by Elliott. On the second day, the roles were reversed and the blue-eyed children were made to feel inferior while the brown eyes were designated the dominant group.  gt;What happened over the course of the unique two-day exercise astonished both students and teacher. On both days, children who were designated as inferior took on the look and behavior of genuinely inferior students, performing poorly on tests and other work. In contrast, the  #8220;superior #8221; students  #8212; students who had been sweet and tolerant before the exercise  #8212; became mean-spirited and seemed to like discriminating against the  #8220;inferior #8221; group.  gt; #8220;I watched what had been marvelous, cooperative, wonderful, thoughtful children turn into nasty, vicious, discriminating little third-graders in a space of fifteen minutes, #8221; says Elliott. She says she realized then that she had  #8220;created a microcosm of society in a third-grade classroom. #8221;</TEXT>

    <TEXT>When I was a teen, although I lived in a house full of women and only one guy, I was the only person old/young/healthy enough to be menstruating. I used sanitary towels and when changing, I #8217;d wrap them in tissue and put them in the bin next to the toilet in the bathroom. It #8217;s mostly used for just things like empty toilet rolls and bits of toilet paper used to wipe your mouth after brushing teeth and stuff like that. One day, I #8217;m upstairs and I hear shouting about the toilet. It #8217;s clogged. By a sanitary towel. They call me down, and they were like  #8220;you know, you #8217;re not supposed to flush them!! #8221; And obviously I was like  #8220;what, I haven #8217;t been downstairs all day, wasn #8217;t me!? #8221; But they were like  #8220;but you #8217;re the only one it could have been! #8221; And they just didn #8217;t believe me. Which is one of my biggest pet peeves. Then like a day or so later I wall past the bathroom, and the doors open. My nan is cleaning and this means changing the bin. I watch her fucking reach into the bin, take handfulls of toilet roll from the bin and put it in the toilet. Again, I wrap my used sanitary towels in tissue for discretion. I was livid and was literally like  #8220;I FUCKING TOLD YOU IT WASNT ME!! #8221; And she was like ???? And I explained that I put my sanitary towels in the bin. She just laughed it off. Apparently funny when she does it, but not when I allegedly did it.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Anything that I wasn #8217;t in the mood for. It #8217;s that simple. I #8217;m married, and I adore my husband, and am still extremely attracted to him even after 12 years, but if he just came up and stuffed his hands down my pants without any warning or time for me to prepare, I #8217;d be fucking livid. There #8217;s this implication (no, not *that* implication) present in our relationship that a quick grope is always ok. But anything more than that NEEDS to be talked about first. I #8217;m not just going to put my hands down his pants without asking because he might feel like his crotch is too sweaty and it makes him uncomfortable. I will get super mad if my husband tries to get his hands inside my bra without warning because my bras are uncomfortable at the best to times so moving it will cause more issues, and it also risks ripping/damaging my bras, which are very expensive. But, let #8217;s go back to a time before he was even my boyfriend. I fancied THE FUCK out of him for like 2 years before we even spoke, but if at any point he had come up to me and touched my breasts or crotch without working up to it (like I at least expect us to have kissed first!) I would have considered that threatening. A giant red flag. And I likely would have stopped being attracted to him and started seeing him as a creep. Basically ANY sexual contact that wasn #8217;t happening in the right context would be gross, even if he was super hot. Though if we were in an environment where these things were implicit, like a party or something, I might be more lenient, but I likely would have been giving strong signals, if not explicitly stating interest.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I literally cannot tell you, I screamed the same thing at her. Like, there was also used wet wipes in there too - the whole point of putting something in the bin and not the toilet is because it can #8217;t be flushed! Beyond that she was using her BARE hand! She doesn #8217;t know what was on that tissue, could have been anything! Fuckin gross ugh. She stopped doing it after that but still angry she ever did it in the first place.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>And even when a kid is being a little shit, the only person I want to drop kick is the parent - if they #8217;re not at least trying to parent. To clarify, when i said  #8220;being a little shit #8221; I don #8217;t mean just crying, or even having a tantrum. Kids cry sometimes, everything is new to them and the world is confusing and scary, and even good parents can #8217;t just turn off their children #8217;s emotions, even if they #8217;re irrational. What I #8217;m talking about is when they #8217;re going around screaming for  #8220;fun #8221; or breaking shit, or bothering people in ways that can easily be prevented by even the slightest parental supervision. I #8217;m sorry but if you #8217;re standing there watching your child smash another child #8217;s toy on the floor repeatedly and do nothing, you #8217;re a cunt, and don #8217;t deserve to have children, and deserve to be dropkicked.</TEXT>

It doesn #8217;t fix things but at least these cops are angry about what happened #8221; - I thought they resigned because of what happened to the old guy. I was super tired, and happy to see one good thing before bed, so didn #8217;t read the whole post. Woke up this morning and saw the same story but with a more clear title. They resigned to protests that they were held accountable. Because the guys that did it were suspended. For fucks sake.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Mostly I just wanted to point out that there is a difference. Though when it comes to movies if the actors are friends and they #8217;ve spoken about it and consent, then I think it #8217;s fine. But if the actor is doing it because they #8217;re worried they #8217;ll lose their job if they don #8217;t - that #8217;s coercion. That #8217;s not ok. Involving unwilling people in your fetish, even if it #8217;s not explicitly a  #8220;sexual #8221; fetish (like to someone without a fetish, there #8217;s nothing sexual about feet), is disgusting and wrong. But even then, there #8217;s still a huge difference between making an adult do weird stuff with their feet, even if it makes them uncomfortable, and making a child do it. If it #8217;s Schneider #8217;s fetish, he #8217;s getting sexual gratification from those children. That makes him a pedophile.</TEXT>

First, no one knows how to spell it - it #8217;s not even like, weirdly lettered, it #8217;s spelled how it sounds, but people always overestimate and add loads of unnecessary letters or even just put in letters that are obviously not in there?? It #8217;s weird. Also, while most people can say it, a lot of people get it wrong when reading it - even though, again, it #8217;s spelled how it sounds. Lastly, my name was never on any of those dumb key rings at tourist places and stuff. Sounds stupid but as a kid it always just hurt, when everyone else was going through them and finding their names and I was just like... there #8217;s no point. There was a time when I was very young that i would still look and hope. One time my sister (who has an equally  #8220;unique #8221; name) actually found one with her name on it and we freaked out, but obviously couldn #8217;t find one for me... Another weird thing is I hate hearing people say my name to me. Like if they just say it randomly in conversation it just makes me feel really uncomfortable and like they #8217;re talking down to me? I only like it when people I know say my full name, I prefer strangers to use the shorter version. I always say when I meet people  #8220;my name is [name], but [short name] is easier #8221; so I don #8217;t have to listen to them struggle say my name back to me correctly after literally just hearing me say it.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I think public proposals are ok IF you have both talked about getting married to the point where you basically both agreed  #8220;yes, someday we #8217;ll get married #8221; in private. Otherwise you need to be prepared for a no, and doing a big public thing is just setting yourself up for that situation. The person being asked didn #8217;t set this up, you can #8217;t blame them for something they had no part in.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Omg literally this week the craziest thing~ So, my mum calls me and says she wants to hang out because she hasn #8217;t seen me in ages, and she calls my sister (because she has a car) to hang out too. My sister turns up, and tells me and my husband that my cousin (who I #8217;m not super close to, but my sister is) had messaged her with this story. This woman had been messaging my cousin #8217;s fianc #233;s mum and other family members, asking questions about this man in their family. The man in question was estranged so it was very weird for this person to be asking questions and having certain knowledge. So my cousin went snooping on this woman #8217;s Facebook, and saw she had friends in common. That friend being me, and my husband. My sister just happened to be seeing our cousin that day, so we went to see her where she told me the rest. She said she couldn #8217;t believe it when she saw the pictures of me on this strangers profile, it was so surreal. She sent me screenshots of the conversations. This person, was my *mother in law*. My very *married* mother in law. In the first set of questions she said she was seeing the man she was asking questions about, but in later conversations with someone else she said this man was seeing her daughter and she was worried that this man was lying about who he is. Either way, my cousin and her family read this as my mother in law cheating on her husband (they saw she was married on her profile) and trying to find out more information about this male relative. My cousin was worried about telling me but knew she had to. I forwarded the screenshots to my husband and we talked about them, and what i noticed about them, is they did *not* look like they were written by my mother in law. She writes borderline incoherently. Lots of pauses, missing words and unnecessary punctuation. Where as these messages, while sometimes a little odd, were mostly written properly. Another red flag was that when she was called out as being a related to my cousin through me, she named my mum by her Facebook name, which is different to her real name and it #8217;s obvious this person just checked Facebook to see her name, but my mother in law 100% knows my mums name and would have called her so. The final sign that it wasn #8217;t her, was that she referred to her sons as  #8220;step sons #8221; - this seemed like a huge slip. I thought it was her husband, who is controlling, possessive, and paranoid about her cheating. He is much better with phones and tech in general than she is, and it seems he has been using her account and then deleting the messages. She found out later it was him because she took the phone to a police friend who checked it for her, and they #8217;re still looking into it. So basically my mother in law was (seemingly) cheating with my cousin #8217;s fianc #233;s uncle (i think? It was confusing), but then it turned out it was her jealous husband posing as her because last time they went clubbing his guy touched her thigh. It #8217;s like one of those convoluted tv comedy dramas. Literally what are the chances?? We don #8217;t even all live in the same towns. (For those worried about her situation, she is considering leaving him after this, and has a lot of support and family she can stay with if she needs to leave quickly. She #8217;ll be ok.)</TEXT>

Not every relationship is supposed to last forever, maybe this is the wake up call that you've outgrown him. People change, and obviously he can't handle that. If the only things keeping you with him are 1) the time you've already spent together (don't waste more time you could be spending on yourself or someone else) and 2) he's nice sometimes (lots of guys are nice \*all\* of the time, don't settle) - you deserve better reasons.</TEXT>

I know it happens but literally, it #8217;s so rare, that it #8217;s kinda gross that it feels like the majority of animated characters with tan skin have blue eyes. Like is it just me? Or do other people get the feeling every time they see yet another (usually black female) character with blue eyes, that in the design process they were like  #8220;you can have a black character but make sure you give her a LITTLE bit of whiteness so the **t a r g e t a u d i e n c e** can relate to her. #8221; Like why cant minority OR white characters have brown eyes and still be beautiful?? /rant.

    <TEXT>The other day my (very white) mum basically said black people should be thankful for slavery because, quote  #8220;at least they #8217;re not over *there* eating berries anymore #8221;. I was shocked and disgusted. I knew she was racist, but not like THAT. She has many black friends and through her 20s and 30s dated almost only black men. The fact that she could still say something like that after knowing and loving black people is heinous to me. I shouted down the phone at her over it until she hung up, because none of her back peddling or counter arguments held up against my defence. She was contradicting her own points, all I had to do was repeat her own points to her and ask  #8220;which is it? #8221; And she couldn #8217;t answer. I #8217;m still angry about it, and haven #8217;t spoken to her since. The worst part is, a few days before, we were talking about the protests and police violence (she #8217;s had bad experiences with police too) and she seemed sympathetic and was largely agreeing with the cause.

    <TEXT>Problem is my mum is one of those people who *only* listens when you get loud. I #8217;ve tried to talk other things out with her calmly but she just has this  #8220;agree to disagree #8221; attitude where she feels her opinions are as valid as facts. She only listens to shouting because I rarely shout at her over things unless I #8217;m angry, and I tend not to get angry over just anything. Unfortunately my family has always lacked communication and often whoever talks loudest is the winner/right. I don #8217;t act like that with other people but if I want to make a point with my family that #8217;s the only way to get through to them. I hate it but it #8217;s easier to do things their way than just hope they hear my calm whispers. I tried that approach and it didn #8217;t work.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>It depends. You should know your parter well enough to know what is ok and what is a sensitive subject. My husband was emotionally abused and constantly told he was stupid, so I never make jokes about him being stupid because I know he #8217;s conditioned to take that to heart. I #8217;m fat, and I don #8217;t mind if after I #8217;ve joked about my weight my husband makes follow up joke, that #8217;s fine. But if he randomly made jokes about my weight it would upset me and make me not want to be around him. We joke about everything, even things most people would raise an eyebrow about (he makes fun of my mums addiction, I make fun of his mums cheating) but even we have boundaries. Having boundaries doesn #8217;t mean you  #8220;take yourself seriously #8221;, and if you cared about them you #8217;d know respect those boundaries, even if that means losing out on some good joke potential.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>No, but the problem is when people use the later argument to suggest that the former is ok. And it happens a lot. Most people know fat is unhealthy. But what #8217;s more unhealthy is constant emotional and mental abuse from every angle, to the point where it damages your self esteem so much you literally just give up and give into self destructive behaviour, and just get even fatter. Honestly If you first reaction when seeing someone write  #8220;fat people deserve basic human decency and respect as people #8221; is to start shouting about how it #8217;s unhealthy - you #8217;re just fat phobic. Health shouldn #8217;t be a prerequisite for respect.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Again, it depends on what the person is actually saying. Like so many times I see people literally just talking about feeling good about themselves *despite* their weight, not spreading fake facts, not lying, literally just talking about not feeling subhuman for once, and the replies will be filled with  #8220;corrections #8221; and  #8220;advise #8221;. No one wants to be fat. People aren #8217;t seeing far positive messages and going  #8220;I think I #8217;ll get fat seeing as it #8217;s healthy and beautiful now #8221;. It #8217;s for people who are already fat. To give them the confidence and self worth to actually start helping themselves and making positive changes. Becoming healthier as a result. People are more upset seeing someone say  #8220;love yourself #8221; than they are by  #8220;kill yourself #8221; to fat people and I #8217;m sick of people pretending they give two shits about the  #8220;health #8221; of fat people.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>It #8217;s easier said than done. Do you have any heroin addicts in your life? It #8217;s not easy. They aren #8217;t always the person you need them to be and more often than not they #8217;re the person who ends up hurting you the most. You can #8217;t love addiction away, and support is just that - support. Alone it #8217;s not enough, it needs to be in conjunction with professional help, security and stability. It #8217;s easy to say  #8220;I would be supportive #8221; but until you experience loving and being hurt by an addict you can #8217;t know how hard it is, and you may very well end up acting like Jessica, or worse.

After we met (it was kind of a disaster but I won #8217;t go into it) I liked him even more because not only did we get along, he was more cute in person as he was in his one picture on bebo. Later, I saw someone post on his bebo wall something like  #8220;how did it go with that girl #8221; and I was curious so went to this persons profile and the guy I liked was like  #8220;not great, she was kind of a chav #8221; or something along those lines and... I was an emo girl, ok. Being called a chav was THE biggest insult you could have thrown at me. That night we spoke on the phone and we basically mutually agreed things weren #8217;t going to work between us. I don #8217;t know if he knew I saw what he wrote, but he did it basically in public so he must? Or at least knew there was a chance, and did it anyway. So yeah. I thought I loved him, like I genially believed I loved him. But calling me a chav was too far and I just couldn #8217;t feel that way for him anymore. I was heartbroken.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Ok but think about it. If a group of women were talking about rapists, and a stranger man walked up to them and just said  #8220;I #8217;m not a rapist #8221; You know what *most* people would assume about that guy? That he #8217;s a fucking rapist. Not saying you are a rapist, but if upon hearing women talk about all the hardships they #8217;ve endured at the hands of men, your first instinct is to bust in and shout  #8220;NOT ME #8221; then maybe you should ask yourself why you #8217;re so desperate for strangers to believe that about you, when you were never in question to begin with. If you have nothing to add to the conversation other than  #8220;your not taking about me #8221;, why say anything at all? I want an actual answer. Why say anything at all, if you know we #8217;re not talking about you?</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Don #8217;t get life lessons from tv, anime or otherwise. Get it through experience with real women, not just as romantic partners, but also as friends. Start with female family members if you #8217;re too shy to talk to other girls. If you already have female friends, talk to them about their experiences with boys. Anime is written almost entirely by men. You #8217;re not going to get real representations of women, only the idea of what the writers think women should be and should interact with men. I love anime, but I wouldn #8217;t take any life advise from it.</TEXT>

I had one family with a grandparent who was alien - her kid was human skinned, their kids were human skinned, and then BOTH of them had alien skinned children, even though they were with other humans. The alien skin was recessive and came back in the great grand children! Also whatever hair they were born with was their  #8220;natural #8221; hair colour. If you changed it the child #8217;s genetics would ignore the new colour. It was just so much better.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>**TL;DR: a guy at GameStation gave me something for free so I could play an old PS1 game when I was a teenager.** When I was a kid I had a copy version of this game, Rhapsody: A Musical Adventure on PS1, it was my favourite game ever, I played it for literally months until I got stuck. my evil step cousin snapped the disc, and I was never able to finish the game. When I was a teenager, I realised I could buy a real version of the game. But I couldn #8217;t find a PAL version! So I had to order the NTSC version. But I couldn #8217;t get it to play. I thought using the cheat/copy disc would make it work (I #8217;d read online it would) So on a whim, I went to a GameStation and told the guy behind the counter my problem. I knew it was a stretch, but it paid off! The guy was super sympathetic and told me to buy a PS1 with a slot in the back for a cheat cartridge (mine didn #8217;t have the slot) and then come back, and he would *see if* he could find his old cheat cartridge. I left feeling ecstatic - I #8217;m getting *so close*! Bought the PS1 with the slot, and came back a few days later. Again I wasn #8217;t holding out hope that he had it but it was nice enough that he even offered. But he had it!!! I was like  #8220;how much? #8221; Expecting him to charge me because he went through all that effort - which I was fine with! But he was just like  #8220;nah, you can have it, at least it #8217;s getting used now #8221; and I was like omg thank you so much! Got home, it worked, and over the next few weeks i completed my favourite game. All thanks to that guy!</TEXT>

    <TEXT>It #8217;s not even just about trust, hormonal BC can fail for lots of reasons besides just the human mistake of forgetting to take it. For example, If she gains too much weight or if she #8217;s on antibiotics. Wearing a condom is the best way to prevent pregnancy. Both condom and BC is better (though not always an option) Condoms are ALWAYS an option, and one that should always be taken unless actively trying for a baby.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I liked Ron but their romance seemed forced. I mean, you #8217;re telling me Ron wouldn #8217;t be happier with someone with a similar sense of humour, someone he can have pointless conversations with without being corrected all the time? And I #8217;m certain Hermione would be happier with someone she didn #8217;t *need* to correct all the time, someone more serious who is more on her level and challenges her. I don #8217;t think it #8217;s a bad thing for a powerful and intelligent woman to want companionship. I #8217;ve noticed people seem to have this idea that If a woman is independent that automatically translates to  #8220;single by choice #8221; when you can be independent and want a relationship, it doesn #8217;t make her any less brilliant, as long as she finds a man or woman who supports her shine instead of trying to dull it. I don #8217;t think Ron  #8220;dulls #8221; Hermione per se, but I just don #8217;t think he has the capacity to support her true potential. They are just too different. I know  #8220;opposites attract #8221; but... do they? Really? Because I know this is just anecdotal but most successful relationships I know in real life are between people who are very similar or compliment each others personalities. Any time I #8217;ve seen people who could be described as  #8220;opposites #8221; forming a relationship, it has always failed because they want different things, and they just never spoke about those things in the beginning because of the excitement. Once the novelty of seeing how someone else lives life wears off, you #8217;re just left with someone you can #8217;t even hold a conversation with because your interests are too different, or your gap between your intellects is too big and one is just incapable of some conversations.  #8220;Idiot ends up with Hot Nerd #8221; and it #8217;s gender swapped equivalent,  #8220;Hot idiot ends up with Nerd #8221; tropes might happen occasionally in real life but generally is pretty unrealistic and can #8217;t be sustained once the honeymoon period is over. It honestly seems like Hermione settled for her high school boyfriend. He #8217;s not a bad guy but he #8217;s not really the guy for her. ETA: shit, I just realised after sending how long this rant was, and I apologise.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>It very much is. A person will say  #8220;I like anime #8221;, because it #8217;s almost it #8217;s own identity. Like being a gamer. It #8217;s a fandom because even if you don #8217;t like the same show as another person, just liking the same forms of media is enough to form a community around. And anime has hentai, which I would say most anime fans have probably seen, even if it #8217;s not their preferred porn medium, and there are people who like hentai more than normal anime. Being a furry is the same. Most furries just enough the art/character design/story telling aspect of the fandom, but there are people who like furry porn more than other stuff in the community. Another parallel is fursuits and cosplay. The majority of anime fans don #8217;t cosplay, and the majority of furries don #8217;t have suits, and many don #8217;t even want one. It #8217;s not an essential part of being a furry like the stereotype suggests. All being a furry is, is thinking animal people is cool. All the sexual stuff is just humans being human. Give me one fandom that doesn #8217;t have a porn side.</TEXT>

Kids know it #8217;s not true, so they have sex without understanding what they #8217;re doing, and get pregnant, injured, infected, or end up in situations where they #8217;re being taken advantage of. Sex Ed is the only way to protect children from themselves, each other, and predators. Parents are supposed to look after their kids but the sad fact is many children come from abusive or neglectful homes and their parents cannot be trusted. Schools and public education are meant to be  #8220;the great equaliser #8221; (even if we know that #8217;s not true in practice) but how can children be equal when some of them have access to information and facts about their bodies and reproductive rights, and others do not by no fault of their own. Especially for young girls. An unwanted pregnancy could derail her life the way it might not for a boy in the same situation. Adult men are always looking for vulnerable and uneducated girls to groom and rape - those experiences can cause life long psychological damage. Sex education isn #8217;t just to make sure kids know how to have sex. It #8217;s to help them understand why they should and shouldn #8217;t make certain choices. I also believe relationships should be part of sex education. Things like consent, red flags, manipulation, abuse - all these things should be talked about with children BEFORE they start having sexual relationships.</TEXT>

    <TITLE>UK tenant: Who is responsible to pay in this situation?</TITLE>
    <DATE>2020-07-04 11:31:01</DATE>
    <TEXT>I #8217;m a tenant, and have been living here for over 5 years and the shower in the bath has been here longer than we have. It #8217;s the kind where the two taps are combined into one, with a shower hose in the middle and one leaver that controls the temperature (left and right) and pressure (basically just on and off though) with a little pull stop that changes the water from coming out the tap to going through the shower. The whole thing is metal except the bit inside, which is this weird rubbery plastic. Through what I believe to be normal wear and tear, today the handle just snapped off as I was getting out of the shower. I was trying to turn it off but it snapped before the water stopped. This meant there was no way to turn the water off, as neither faucet has it #8217;s own tap, and the only way to get it to stop was to turn off the water mains. (If there is a point where we can turn off just the bath, we couldn #8217;t find it. And we *really* looked.) Obviously we called the landlord because we are now without water, and he quickly informed us that we would be responsible to pay for repairs. He claims it comes under accidental damage. Neither of us think this is right, as it wasn #8217;t an accident, it was something that would have happened eventually, and obviously it #8217;s something that wouldn #8217;t have happened if he had maybe replaced it before it got to this point. My point being, this, to me, seems more just a case of normal wear and tear, just like when the boiler breaks, we don #8217;t have to pay for it because he is responsible for it, it #8217;s his house and he is responsible for maintaining it. I would understand if we had just moved in and were extra rough with it, but this is not the case. We #8217;ve never caused trouble. But I know I can say all this and the law might see it differently. I would just like to know, legally, where we stand if he tries to get us to foot the bill. I think just the shower and taps needs replacing (so not like we need a full plumber visit) and shouldn #8217;t cost much but it #8217;s still more than we have. For reference, we are in a flat (house converted into 4 flats) and low income, though not on benefits. We are in England.</TEXT>

Yes, we need the tap to use the shower/bath, as it #8217;s the only way to control the water. Right now it #8217;s stuck in  #8220;on #8221; mode, and we found that it doesn #8217;t have its own pressure valve, so to turn it off, we have to turn off ALL the water. It #8217;s basically a choice between leaving the water running (which is wasteful and expensive) or not having any water at all, no sink, no washing machine - no toilet. The water valve is in an extremely awkward place and it #8217;s a huge hassle to turn it on and off, but our plan is it turn it on for short periods to do essential things like flush the toilet or wash dishes. I will keep this in mind for when the landlord brings it up again.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Because those  #8220;watch it free #8221; websites are constantly changing address and sometimes fake versions pop up that are literally just there to give you viruses. Even on the real version, there is risk of viruses. It takes forever to download an episode of something (for us at least) where as Netflix just plays as soon as you put it on. You don #8217;t have to search for a good quality version with netflix, while you might have to click 3 or 4 links before you find a good quality version on one of those websites. As someone else mentioned - subtitles. I need them because though I #8217;m not deaf, I have a form of deafness where I can #8217;t differentiate foreground sound like speech with background noise very well and miss dialogue if there #8217;s no subtitles. Not every one of these websites has them and I #8217;m not going to go and download them separately. When your browsing Netflix, it suggests stuff to you based on your watching history, so you find stuff you might not otherwise have seen. That doesn #8217;t happen on random websites. And a big one is that I mostly use my PS4 to watch tv. I #8217;ve tried using those free sites to watch old cartoons but the browser just doesn #8217;t have enough space. But it can run Netflix and other streaming services. Basically, you #8217;re paying for convenience and safety. We #8217;re pretty poor but even for us the cost of like,  #163;7 a month is worth it. We know every time that a movie we pick is going to be good quality, not going to give us a virus, will have subtitles and is likely something we #8217;ll enjoy. No pissassing about on suspicious websites putting my PC at risk.</TEXT>

Yes, they might get more messages, but it #8217;s a quality vs quantity situation. If 99 of those messages are vile, offensive, or just 0 effort, but one is good - she functionally got one message. And it makes it harder to find those good messages when she has to wade through all the shit to find it. They also conveniently forget that #8217;s not every woman #8217;s experience. Attractive men get lots of messages too. And unattractive women get low amounts of messages, and most of them are from  #8220;desperate #8221; men who are trying to do her  #8220;a favour #8221; by fucking her even though she #8217;s  #8220;ugly #8221;. Even the statistic they throw around about women on dating sites rating like 80% of men below average in attractiveness. They conveniently leave out the part where women were more likely to contact men they had deemed  #8220;unattractive #8221; than men were. So it negates their entire point.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>The need to drive is not in any way equivalent to the want to play a game that you willingly spent money on. And if the things you were shouting from your car were illegal, like violent threats which are illegal in some places, then yes, you should have your licence revoked. If you can #8217;t control yourself enough not to scream threats at strangers, how can you be trusted to drive a car? But the fact is that #8217;s not a law, so you don #8217;t have to worry. But what is a rule, is not being hateful to other players in online spaces. Again, if controlling your mouth is such a problem for you, maybe you should take actions to prevent yourself from getting in trouble over it - like not using a mic. Then you can scream at the screen all you want and not worry about being banned. That #8217;s what you agreed to when you chose to play online with other people. ETA: it sucks your account was hacked and they should have measures in place to help you if you can prove it. I don #8217;t know if they do or not, it #8217;s never happened to me but if not that #8217;s fucked.

    <TEXT>I didn #8217;t misread your comment, when I said  #8220;you #8221; about not being about to control your mouth that was more a general  #8220;you #8221; as in, anyone who might be reading who has problems controlling their mouths. Not targeted at you, I know it wasn #8217;t you who got banned for being rude. I acknowledged your situation in an edit, but that doesn #8217;t change that it #8217;s a completely different situation. Identity theft happens in other aspects of life too, and has unfair consequences for the victims - that #8217;s not something unique to game platforms, and again, is its own separate issue, Which you pointed out can be fixed. When someone chooses to break the rules they get banned and they deserve it, regardless of how much money they spent. The fact that your friend just made another account also has nothing to do with the point. You were saying in your original post that it #8217;s  #8220;not fair #8221; because your friend  #8220;got mad and said some stuff #8221; and lost his account. You played it down, as though he didn #8217;t deserve to be banned, now you #8217;re saying he goes out of he way to be a cunt, to the point where he has a whole new account *just be be a cunt* so he #8217;s not worried about being banned, but somehow he can keep his cool on his account he spends money on. So your point about people  #8220;just losing their temper #8221; really has no leg to stand on, because your own example is proof that your friend is just a prick who knows better and was just stupid enough to be a prick on his main account, and got in trouble for it. As for the driving example, again, not a good analogy because when people can #8217;t drive they can lose their job, home, everything. When you lose a gaming account, you only lose what money you #8217;ve already spent - which sucks but it #8217;s not going to impact the path of your immediate financial future. You haven #8217;t lost the ability to make more money when your PSN account is shut down (unless you #8217;re like a streamer or you tuber but in that case you should be more careful, like any employee is careful not to lose their job) There are no laws about not being an asshole driver unless your being like, actually dangerous. Online games DO have rules about being assholes because the owners of the game will lose money if no one wants to play their game because of other players. And yeah, people get angry sometimes, but feelings and actions are separate, and while people are entitled to feel however they feel, the second they act on it in a way that is detrimental to other people, they are 100% responsible for those actions. Screaming at people is an action. Everyone gets angry but most adults or even late teens can control themselves enough not to react like a child, and if they can #8217;t... they have to be willing to either take responsibility for the consequences, or learn to be better. And then there are people like your friend who isn #8217;t  #8220;just getting angry #8221; but actively choosing to just be a bastard. And he deserves to have his shit taken away if he can #8217;t share.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I get what you #8217;re saying, I understand the fears but also everything was new once, and we made rules for them. Using cars as example again, they were new and unregulated once, but now you need a licence, we have roads and road laws, and in most places the government is responsible for making sure there are safe, usable roads. We have the internet now. People will complain and organise and boycott services that take advantage. But things like PayPal just ending and people losing their money - again, that already happens with banks. These aren #8217;t new problems, they #8217;re just packaged in a new way, and we either already have ways of dealing with it or there is no way for us to deal with it in our current system and it #8217;s just a risk we take. Even when it comes to game services shutting down and losing all those games - similar things have already happened. Old games servers go offline - for primarily online games, that means you can #8217;t use it anymore. You paid for the game but sorry, they don #8217;t support it anymore. My husband had a bunch of digital comics on his PSP and the service was shut down and he lost them all. It sucks but what could he do? If you are worried about losing games, for now at least, buy physical copies. Everytime we spend money online is a risk, and that risk is compounded when you are buying something that you can #8217;t hold. It #8217;s scary but we accept those risks.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>It #8217;s because it presents different in men and women. Women only really get diagnosed if they have other developmental disorders that are common with autism, but if you #8217;re someone with high functioning autism - fuck you, you #8217;re on your own. Where I live they still diagnose women based on the male criteria. I had been researching how autism affects women for years before I tried to get a diagnosis and I hit just about every single common trait, including sensory issues that have impacted my life in very serious ways. After my assessment they said I had  #8220;autistic tendencies #8221; whatever the fuck that means, and they think some of the more prevalent symptoms I have could have been explained by childhood trauma... like I can #8217;t have childhood trauma *and* be autistic?? It was so stupid. Like I have this laundry list of mental and physical health problems that they are saying are all separate, that could be explained by autism. But I guess I didn #8217;t like trains enough?? The don #8217;t take into consideration the biological differences but also just the societal differences that lead to it presenting less obviously in women. Girls are socialised more than boys, so girls on the higher end of the spectrum are able to blend in better. Not always perfectly but usually enough to get by. Our interests are usually shaped by what is  #8220;acceptable #8221; for little girls to be into. Little boys can love trains and planes, but little girls are pushed towards animals and people, dolls and teddys. So maybe I don #8217;t have a collection of mint condition baseball cards. But I did have many digital collections online. Neopets, dragon cave creature breeder, felisfire, lioden... I don #8217;t even need to mention my obsession with collecting every coin, jewel, star, ring that was counted towards 100% completion on computer games. But all that isn #8217;t *obvious*. And after 23 years of trying to blend in - still always having the reputation of being a bit weird - I am able to hold a conversation, and I am eloquent. *Because I practiced.* I made the conscious effort to know big words, and how to use them in conversation, and I would think up analogies to explain myself in my spare time, so when I had to (because I always fucking had to) it was less confusing for people. Maybe it seemed effortless, but it was *very* deliberate, and was not always the case for me. Summery: getting diagnosed for autism when you #8217;re woman with no other developmental challenges in the UK fucking sucks. /rant</TEXT>

Babies, regardless of genitals, are all exactly the same, to the point where no person can tell a male baby from a female baby with 100% accuracy without seeing its genitals. Children are physically almost identical in muscle and bone density and strength until just before puberty starts. The the minor differences in inherent ability for things like language in women and mathematics in men are believed to be based more on how little boys and girls are socialised than it being  #8220;natural #8221;.</TEXT>

Imagine my delight when I found out here in the UK, it #8217;s all automatic! Unless you #8217;re like, self employed, but I think even then it #8217;s not as complicated as in America.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Going back is usually a bad idea. You #8217;ve forgotten why you broke up in the first place. If it didn #8217;t work before, why assume it will work this time? If anything, things might get worse, because now they know you #8217;ll always come back. Being lonely is painful but there are so many other places you can find companionship.

    <TEXT>To be fair, they should definitely have a class where they teach you about common living expenses and how to navigate them. When I got my first rented place, I had NO idea how to pay some of the bills, like how was I supposed to know my water bill would just show up? I kept trying to find out how to register or find out who I was with... I was so confused! Especially in the last couple of years in school, there should be a class that teaches kids things like their rights as tenants (as most of them will rent either right after school or some time in the future) and how to budget. Common hidden fees and costs that you don #8217;t know about until you start actually looking to move out (like I never knew tenant #8217;s insurance was a thing? It #8217;s mandatory for most renters!)</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Probably depends on the guy, but I know for a fact that me and my husband wouldn #8217;t be together if I haven #8217;t actively perused him because he was too anxious and depressed to even believe that I liked him even after I told him I liked him. I asked him out, I kissed him first, and he thought I initiated sex for the first time (it was a misunderstanding but I went with it) I wouldn #8217;t get along with the kind of guy that *didn #8217;t* like me being so forward. And they probably wouldn #8217;t like me. So again, it depends on the guy and it depends on you - do you *want* to make the first move? Or do you want to be perused? Because if you #8217;re tired of waiting and want to make a move, go for it. The worst he can do is say no, and then you #8217;re free to move on and find someone who suits you better.</TEXT>

I #8217;m saying that amount of cat-ness, coupled with that exact name - which isn #8217;t a common name associated with cats - makes this copying. If op had written  #8220;my take on ventrexians from final space #8221; then no one would be bothered. But they presented ventrexians as if they were this new original to them race. If they didn #8217;t want to be accused of stealing, they should have changed some thing about the way the people look, or preferably the name, as it is such a unique and specific name. If it were something more general like  #8220;Felinese #8221; or something, that could be forgivable. But ventrexian is so specific. It is straight up copying. I don #8217;t give a shit if it #8217;s not officially  #8220;copyrighted #8221;, it #8217;s still copying. That #8217;s why so many people here have a problem with it.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>the problem with smoking is the IMMEDIATE detrimental effect it has on people close by. Smoking in public, whether nicotine or marijuana, should be illegal, and hopefully phased out in favour of other ways to take said drugs. I #8217;m not all to bothered about whether those ways are  #8220;healthier #8221; or  #8220;safer #8221; for the individual- just that it doesn #8217;t impact other people the way smoke does. People drinking is annoying, but unless they spill the alcohol on me, my clothes aren #8217;t going to be stained with the stink of alcohol If someone is drinking next to me. If someone takes a bump of cocaine in the elevator next to me, it #8217;s not going to make me cough and leave me with a sore throat. It #8217;s not a  #8220;slippery slope #8221; because smoking is on a different hill than other drugs/substances, (other than ones that are already illegal that you can smoke.)</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Not me but my aunt. She was dating this guy who seemed perfect. Bought her flowers, wrote her poems, wanted to spend all his time with her - all the stuff she considered  #8220;gentlemanly #8221;. He was some kind of long haul delivery driver so he would be gone for weeks at a time but always bring her gifts back. He came to Christmas dinner one year and after they left EVERYONE agreed that he gave of a really weird  #8220;off #8221; vibe, even though he was perfectly polite. Half a year later around my aunts birthday, she invited me and my mum to the pub by her house (I was only like 15 at the time) and they were doing karaoke and stuff. Her boyfriend kept calling her asking her to come home but she was like  #8220;no, I #8217;ll come home later, I #8217;m spending some girl time with my family #8221; and he got so mad that he came to the pub and made her leave, so we all went home too. Later that night, my nan (who I lived with) got a phone call at like 3AM from the police saying my aunt was in hospital - this guy had tried to kill her. Literally he was strangling her to death when the police busted in and pulled him off her. After that, it all came out that when he wasn #8217;t seeing my aunt, he was working as a male prostitute, and he was wanted for raping a teen boy. She had no idea about any of it, and before that night he had barely even raised his voice at her, let alone hurt her. It happened so long ago that he #8217;s out of prison now. My aunt is still suffering with the emotional and physical ramifications of that night.</TEXT>

The things they #8217;re writing are typically aimed at or about women, in a a bad way, so the question is - Is the joke pointing out the absurd ways women are spoken to/about by swapping the genders? Or is it mocking women who complain about this kind of stuff when it #8217;s written about women?</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I ran away once. My friend decided she was going to run away and our other friends were like  #8220;we need to talk her out of it #8221; and I was like  #8220;I #8217;ll go with her to keep an eye on her and try and get her to come back #8221; but instead I was just like  #8220;so we #8217;re running away, huh? What we doing? where we going?? #8221; I was so up for it. We walked for a few hours until we made it to farm land (on the outskirts of town) and stopped at a pub for a bit to rest and chat, and then we thought about sleeping in a graveyard or asking if we could sleep in the church, But we stopped at this farm house to ask for some water. (We didn #8217;t bring anything or have any money) The older couple were really nice and gave us some juice. At first we told them we were on a trip with our school but they had gone on ahead, but we were only like 13 so we couldn #8217;t keep our story straight and they got suspicious. Eventually they got it out of us that we were run always and convinced us to call our families. I think about them all the time. But if we #8217;d had brought a drink we might not have stopped and likely would have kept going. We were in the middle of nowhere, with no plan.</TEXT>

But after he moved in, there was just constant shouting and music playing loudly until late in the night. That wasn #8217;t the creepy thing. The creepy thing was that the woman #8217;s daughter accused him of touching her, and her mum kicked her out! I was talking to him in the back garden and he was making his excuses and trying to convince me he wasn #8217;t a nonce. But he certainly seemed to be protesting too much, because he offered up some information that I didn #8217;t have, that made him look *worse*, but he thought it would some how... not? Do that? He basically told me he isn #8217;t allowed to see his toddler son from his previous relationship because his ex  #8220;lied #8221; and said he was molesting him. But he was actually charged for it. So there was enough evidence to put him away - and we all know how hard it is to get the courts to take molestation seriously. Basically admitted to being a full on nonce to argue that he #8217;s not a nonce...</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Edit: **TOP** and bottom colour change, sorry. I #8217;ve noticed in promotional images for the game, presumably taken when the game was in beta, some of the outfits (like pigeon and raptor) are coloured differently. It looks like maybe they used to match the skin colour but I don #8217;t know? They aren #8217;t their normal green/purple. Does anyone know if this was an old feature, and if so, will it return? Or are they actually alternate colours, and in the future we might see the raptor skin in the store again but maybe red instead of green, or a yellow pigeon? Edit: With the new round of items in the store (white pigeon variant) it looks like it is recolours! Mystery solved.</TEXT>

Lastly, even if a woman has a hymen, it doesn #8217;t HAVE to break the first time she has sex. If you take it slow, it can stretch, and remain unbroken. The idea that breaking the hymen is essential to losing virginity is violence perpetuated by our patriarchal history. Women are taught the first time WILL hurt. This is a lie. For most women, it only hurts because the person she is with either doesn #8217;t know, or doesn #8217;t care, that he is being too rough and going too fast. If you want to measure virginity by the normalised violence on her body, go ahead. But just because it #8217;s  #8220;normal #8221; doesn #8217;t mean it #8217;s correct or good.</TEXT>

    <TITLE>The grasshoppers message for me</TITLE>
    <DATE>2020-08-08 12:10:26</DATE>
    <TEXT>Last few days I #8217;ve been noticing a lot of grasshoppers trying to get into my house. Obviously grasshoppers are always around in summer but not usually like this. Not usually in my house. Sometimes I google long questions not expecting a real answer, but to just see what comes up, so on a whim I googled  #8220;why are grasshoppers trying to get into my house #8221; And the result that caught my eye was  #8220;When a grasshopper is trying to tell you something #8221; It was mostly just a cute story of a woman finding a grasshopper in a supermarket but at the bottom it had quoted a section from a wiki on the spiritual significance of grasshoppers, and one part in particular stood out to me:  #8220;*Grasshoppers can only jump forward #8230;.not backward, or sideways. So, when grasshopper shows up he could be reaffirming to you that you are taking the right steps to move forward in your current situation.* #8221; And it just made me really happy. I #8217;m agoraphobic, and have been for many years. But in the last 8 months I #8217;ve finally been getting help. Things have been going really well and while I #8217;m a long way off from being an independent functional adult, just the fact that I #8217;m still making progress after 8 months is monumental to me. I #8217;ve tried to get help in the past but always stop as soon as the first obstacle came along. Not this time. I #8217;ve had obstacles and pushed through. I don #8217;t really believe in signs, but just reading that made me feel good. It #8217;s interesting and kinda funny to me. But I thought you guys would appreciate it. I am the grasshopper right now, and I need to keep jumping forward.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>My husband and I got a taxi to our wedding. We don #8217;t have a car and neither of us can drive, and are too poor to hire a car with a driver. Sure we could have asked one of the guests to give us a lift but we wanted to be alone (or as alone as you can be in a taxi) before we got there. Getting a taxi, though cheap, was a big expense for us that felt like a luxury. Not everyone lives the same life as you or has the same options you do. Being poor doesn #8217;t make you a bad person. Ridiculing people for being poor does. Though in this case the couple is gross for ordering a joint ride and then getting mad. That #8217;s unreasonable.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I think the problem is that other players don #8217;t always appear on our screens where they actually are on their own. When my husband was spectating me on Hex-a-gone, he was freaking out because on his screen it looked like I was walking very close to the edge and sometimes going over but somehow not falling - then he looked at my screen and saw that I was actually right in the middle of the tiles and everything was fine. It #8217;s a latency issue that they really need to fix because tail-grab games are impossible when you think someone is far away but then grab your tail anyway.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I don #8217;t think it #8217;s a specific age, it just depends on your behaviour. If you #8217;re supposed to be more mature but you act like a child when it comes to sex, that #8217;s a red flag. I don #8217;t mean being nervous - that #8217;s normal. But having unrealistic expectations as a teen is somewhat forgivable, but having unrealistic expectations as a middle aged adult is worrying. Being weird about anything sexual, like acting like sex is  #8220;gross #8221; (not counting asexual people) and shouldn #8217;t be spoken about is normal for teens but weird for an adult. Same with the opposite, talking about sex at inappropriate times or in an overtly vulgar way is somewhat excusable (though still kinda red flagish) for teens and simply unacceptable for an adult. Being a virgin isn #8217;t the problem, is your attitude towards sex, and people who you want to have sex with. If you #8217;re a mature and reasonable person, there shouldn #8217;t be any red flags. Personally I #8217;d just assume you just hadn #8217;t met the right person yet and weren #8217;t desperate enough to go out and sleep with just anyone. It happens.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>My husband is naturally left handed but he went to a CofE primary school and they forced him to write with his right hand. The expectation is that means he became ambidextrous - but it turned out the fucking opposite. He #8217;s basically ambisinistrous - rubbish with both hands. His hand writing really suffered and he often holds things wrong. Best example is tying shoes - he holds the loops like a right handed person but pulls them like a left handed person and it means his shoes are constantly coming undone. He still uses his left hand for things most people use their right hand for, except when it needs fine motor skills, then he switches to right. But he denies he is left handed.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>It #8217;s not about coordination, it #8217;s about familiarity. Your daughter has probably played a lot of games, right? His GF might not play games at all. You need to build the muscle memory using a controller. Most of us just never think about it because we were children when we learned. When you #8217;re not used to the way your hands move dictating what you #8217;re seeing, it #8217;s hard for your brain to adjust. It takes time and practice, and it #8217;s harder for adults who are just starting than children.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Real fuckin stressed. My husband and I are going to try to foster my nephew. It #8217;s us, or he goes into the system and obviously none of us want that to happen. We don #8217;t have kids, so that #8217;s a whole new world we #8217;re jumping straight into. And if we #8217;re approved we #8217;ll have to move, which is REALLY stressing me out. But the thing that #8217;s really getting to me is the waiting around for the next step. His social worker has implied that things look positive and they are going to try and push for his placement with us, but she is also taking her time to get back to me. Waiting around for more solid information is fucking painful. I just want to know - should I be looking for a new place? What kind of financial aid will we be entitled to? How long do we have to get a new place? Will he have to come and live with us in our tiny one bed until we can get a new place? So many questions that I need answers for. I #8217;m sitting around here, just not knowing and not being able to MAKE anything happen. No one to call, nothing to plan. I #8217;ve been keeping myself busy by getting a head start on packing - not fully, but organising and throwing out things that we don #8217;t need so we have less to move. Accidentally killed the spider that was taking care of our woodlice problem. AND on top of all of that, I #8217;m still fucking agoraphobic. I #8217;ve been getting help, things have been better than they have been in years, so this has come at sort of the perfect time, but also the worst time - I don #8217;t know if this will be *good* for my recovery, because it #8217;s giving me more of a reason to get out of the house and the motivation to push through, or if it #8217;s going to *hurt* my recovery. I don #8217;t know if it will be too much, too fast. Right now I feel ok about out it, but right now I only have myself to look after and my husband also looks after me a lot too. But now, if this goes through, I will be responsible for another person for the majority of the day. My husband works, so the majority of the parenting is going to fall to me and I #8217;m fine with that division of labour, I just hope I can actually do it - more importantly, I hope I can do it *well*. I #8217;m just scared and frustrated. But I don #8217;t want to talk to my family about it because I think they already have their doubts that we #8217;ll be able to handle him. But I #8217;m not going to let him go into care without a fight.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>For some people - Get help for your depression. Maybe you don #8217;t think you #8217;re depressed, but if you consistently find it hard to do even basic household tasks, or stick to deadlines, you could be depressed. Even if you don #8217;t feel  #8220;sad #8221;, you could still be depressed. For a long time I knew I was depressed (diagnosed) but just didn #8217;t seek help for it because I thought  #8220;what #8217;s the point? Nothing will change #8221; and of course, that was the depression talking. I #8217;ve recently started taking anti-depressants. I #8217;ve taken different kinds in the past and they never worked. This time it #8217;s been like a giant hand has come into my life and picked me up, and has been pushing me forward. I literally do not remember a time in my life from before my depression where I felt this motivated, and I still have low motivation - it #8217;s just higher than it was. If you #8217;re able, try anti-depressants. And don #8217;t just stick with the first one if it doesn #8217;t feel like it #8217;s helping, and don #8217;t just decide that none of them work because the ones you tried haven #8217;t. I feel like I wasted my youth waiting to just magically get better. If it hasn #8217;t happened yet, it won #8217;t ever happen. Don #8217;t waste a decade like me. Get help, if you can.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Exactly. The only people who need to use these terms are researchers and psychologists, and only in the context of a professional setting. Otherwise  #8220;paedophile #8221; is the most correct term for anyone attracted to minors, whether they #8217;re post pubescent or not, in casual discussion.

    <TEXT>I got two ways, one is more greasy than the other. Greasy way first because it takes less time: Get your frying pan, heat it up. I usually leave it at lowest heat which on my cooker is just hot enough to make water boil if you leave it long enough. I don #8217;t know how hot it actually is because it doesn #8217;t have any numbers on it. Butter one side of your bread, put bread in the hot pan. Put the cheese on the bread in the pan. I use mixed grated Cheddar and Red Leicester cheese but slices are probably fine too. Check the bottom every now and then and when it #8217;s dark (or however you like it) put the other piece of bread on top, and make sure it #8217;s buttered but the butter is on the outside. Use a spatula to press it down so the cheese stays steady, then use the spatula to flip the toasty. The cheese will likely not be fully melted yet. It will likely land a little wonky so use the spatula to push the top bread until it #8217;s straight, then just keep checking it until that side is done too. By now cheese should be fully melted. Done. Second way under the grill (I think Americans call it the broiler?). Put one piece of bread in for about 5 mins, don #8217;t flip it! When it #8217;s as dark as you like it, take it out, and on the untoastesd side put your cheese. Put back under the grill until either the cheese is mostly melted OR the corners start to get too dark - whichever is first. Then put a normal piece of bread on top, press it down, not too hard, then leave under the grill until it #8217;s as dark as you like it. Done. Takes longer but I like it better because it #8217;s not as greasy.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>A couple of times. When I was very small, I went to a friends house - they lived just around the corner. I asked my mum if I could go. I had to wake her up and she said yes. She was asleep because she had just smoked heroin. When she woke up, she didn #8217;t remember and freaked out because I was missing. When I came back just as it was getting dark, my mum slapped me across the face. When I was a lot older, early teens, I went shopping with my nan. This was before teens having their own mobiles was common. My purse was in her bag. She wanted to go into one shop, so I said I #8217;d wait for her in Game. She took a really long time so I went to the shop and waited outside, but turns out I had just missed her and she was already off to Game to pick me up. I had no way to get home because my nan has my money, and no phone to call for help. So I went to the police station and they drove me home in a riot van. They said it was all they had but I think they were just trying to be fun. Turns out my nan had headed home to report me missing. Then again when I was a bit older, still early-mid teens, at the end of a school day one of my friends wanted to run away so I went with her. We walked for ages and were gone until it was dark but this nice couple at the farm house we stopped at (to ask for some water - it was summer and we had no money or anything) convinced us to call home. Those are all the times my family called the police to report me missing.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I #8217;m a lady and I also love people laying on my chest. It feels so cosy and I love feeling like I #8217;m that persons  #8220;safe place #8221; even if just while they #8217;re led on me. Mostly just my husband lays on me these days but when I was younger my friends would lay on me too. Also when my nephew was very small, sitting watching tv with him curled up on my lap made me feel so human. There #8217;s a special kind of warmth that comes from a person laying on your chest, straight into your heart.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I asked a lot of guy when I was younger and almost always got a yes, but I would only ask guys I was already pretty sure was kinda into me. Girls definitely are better at picking up on the  #8220;signals #8221;, and also from my experience, our friends also keep an eye on how boys react to us, and tell us what they notice later - so when I #8217;m not looking, my friends might have noticed a guy staring at me but turning when I turn back. I don #8217;t know if boys do that for each other as much. The one time I remember being rejected was the one time I asked a guy without really knowing if he liked me, I just went off the fact that he was friendly with me. I asked if he wanted to get to know each other better and decide if we might want it to turn into something more and he was just like  #8220;I don #8217;t really think of you that way sorry #8221; and I was like  #8220;that #8217;s fine, sorry if I #8217;ve made things awkward #8221; and left. It didn #8217;t really hurt because I knew I didn #8217;t have enough evidence he would say yes. The only other time I asked out a guy expecting him to say no, he ended up being the guy I married!</TEXT>

I personally chose to take my husbands name because my maiden name came from my grandfather, who was a pedophile.

    <TEXT>A while ago there was a news story in my country, where they had foster teens (older ones) living with elderly people. Part of it was that they would help with chores and stuff, and the elderly people would have someone to spend time with. Everyone seemed really happy, the old folks and the teens. The teens enjoyed feeling needed and having responsibility but not having such high expectations. The old people were just really kind and loving. That honestly seems like a great idea.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>There are lots of foster-to-adopt kids in care homes, it #8217;s just that many of them aren #8217;t the  #8220;right race #8221; and most of them aren #8217;t babies. People looking to adopt usually want a fresh slate - a baby too young to have any trauma. Kids in foster care have likely had tough lives, and many of them have emotional or developmental issues that people aren #8217;t willing to deal with. There *are* lots of unwanted kids. But they #8217;re not what typical adopters are looking for. Which is itself the perfect argument for abortion being normalised.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Because adoption is so easy? And to reply to your edit: My husband and I both consider us a couple. He #8217;s not  #8220;nothing #8221; to me, he is everything to me. Which is exactly why I want more of him I #8217;m my life. Having a child that is part him is important to me - that doesn #8217;t necessarily mean bio kids, but a child we #8217;ve raised from birth so I can see my husbands influence in them - the way they talk, their mannerisms, their morality. But unfortunately, adopting a newborn baby is hard. We would be able to look after a baby but compared to other parents looking to adopt, we would be near the bottom of the list. Our most *realistic* chance at having a baby is to birth one. I #8217;ve been with my husband since we were both 15. We #8217;ve been talking about what we #8217;ll do with our future kids for over a decade. Some people want to be doctors, others want to be actors - our dream is to be parents. Just because it #8217;s something other people take for granted, or because it #8217;s not something you personally see as worthy, that doesn #8217;t mean it #8217;s a bad dream. We #8217;re happy together, but we #8217;ve had almost 13 years to enjoy each other alone. We #8217;re both ready to turn this couple, into a family.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Omg. In my country there #8217;s this long running tv soap called  #8220;eastenders #8221; and for some ungodly reason, in secondary school in like year 7 and 8, everyone (well, mostly girls) were *obsessed* with the eastenders website. It had games, like you could dress up some of the characters or answer trivia about the show - typical stuff you #8217;d find on any 2000 #8217;s website. But the *best* thing, was the desktop pals. Obviously we couldn #8217;t download them onto the school computers, but I had a PC at home, and I remember downloading like 4 of these desktop characters from the show, and just having them walk around my screen. They #8217;d climb up the side of windows, and if you moved it they #8217;d fall, and I *think* they would interact too. I didn #8217;t even like eastenders lol</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I remember being 15, trying to buy condoms for the first time. I wasn #8217;t even sure if I legally could buy them (AOC is 16 in the UK) I was still in my school uniform and everything. My friends were giggling and both trying to make me feel better and also poking a little bit of fun. But although I was embarrassed, I told myself  #8220;if you #8217;re not mature enough to buy condoms, you #8217;re not mature enough to have sex #8221; and obviously, I wanted to have sex, so I forced myself to put on a brave  #8220;confident #8221; face and just bought them. I went to the counter by myself. Didn #8217;t get ID #8217;d so I assume it #8217;s not illegal to sell condoms to minors. The woman could probably see through my facade and just didn #8217;t say anything, and was totally normal. After my friends were like  #8220;!!! Omg how did you do that, you #8217;re so brave!

    <TEXT>They might not know what  #8220;gay #8221; means, but 9 is plenty old enough to understand you like some people *more* and in a *different way* to other people. They might not even recognise it as attraction if they #8217;ve only been told  #8220;boys and girls love each other #8221; but they know they just prefer spending time with same sex people. I #8217;m straight but I knew 100% I was attracted to boys by the time I was 9 - and earlier, even if I didn #8217;t yet have the vocabulary to explain it. Being gay is no different. Only difference is straight kids are raised knowing their options - gay kids don #8217;t always get that luxury and often even grow up being told it is explicitly *not* an option.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>My Husband is like you - shy, introverted, maybe even a little misanthropic - and when he started work, he was told he #8217;d have to talk to customers over the phone and he was *terrified*. He got such bad anxiety, he was having a lot of really down days. But, with some time, he got used to it. Now he can easily interact with people. He still had anxiety and doesn #8217;t *like* doing it, but he *can*, and it doesn #8217;t affect his mood anymore. I #8217;m sure the same will be true for you. It will become routine. Socialisation is a skill like any other, and as a skill, it requires practice. It will be hard at first but soon it will be normal.</TEXT>

My husband, for example, was far more damaged by the arguments and obvious hate his parents had for each other than their eventual divorce.

When I got older and found out he #8217;s literally just the controller who happens to be fat, I was like... oh. But honestly, it #8217;s kinda nice. It #8217;s not used as an insult. It #8217;s just a descriptor. I don #8217;t mind being called/described as fat as long as it #8217;s not said maliciously, and I think the fat controller kind of normalises this idea that fat isn #8217;t an inherently insulting term.

    <TEXT>This is such a weird thing to me. Me and my husband have been together since school, and were part of the same friend group, but our friends are very much either my friends, or his friends. He only hangs out with my friends if they come to our house and he comes home (he usually goes out if he knows my friends are coming over). It #8217;s not that he doesn #8217;t like them - he does! And my friends love him too. He just knows we #8217;re probably going to be talking about stuff he doesn #8217;t want to hear (like my friends personal lives) and doesn #8217;t want them to feel like they can #8217;t speak openly while we #8217;re hanging out. Same with his friends, I don #8217;t really speak to them - not because I don #8217;t want to, I just don #8217;t feel the need to. The idea of sharing friends is so alien to me, even though I acknowledge it #8217;s normal - I just don #8217;t know how it would look if we did it. I know this is a little off topic, it #8217;s just always so interesting to me to read about different peoples relationships can look.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>The weirdest realisation of my life was that my mother, who did not raise me but was always around, knew me better than most other people in my life. The people who raised me did not know me at all. Like in the OP, they only knew what I showed them. I was almost an adult before I realised that my mum was the only person who consistently took my mental health issues seriously - even before I did, and knew how certain things would affect me before I had experienced them. I have other people who know me that deeply - my two best friends and my husband - but for better or worse, my mum understands me in a way that only someone with the same personality can, and she always tells me I #8217;m the only person she can talk to as well. Our relationship has had ups, and very big downs, but I always know she understands. And realising that was almost scary. Until then I felt my true self was only for me. No one else could see.

    <TEXT>Most of the time when men say  #8220;women aren #8217;t funny #8221; what they mean is  #8220;women tend to make jokes about things that make me uncomfortable #8221; Comedians make jokes based on their experiences. Men and women experience the world differently, and while women can easily identify with male experiences despite not personally experiencing them, many men can #8217;t, or refuse to identify with women #8217;s experiences. A woman hears a boner joke and laughs, even though she doesn #8217;t have a penis but is conditioned to understand penises and know it #8217;s normal. A woman makes a period joke and men react with disgust, because he doesn #8217;t want to be reminded of women #8217;s biological realities if it isn #8217;t sexual, because only the sexual ( #8220;usable #8221;) aspects of women #8217;s bodies are normalised. Men make a joke about being creepy to women, women laugh because we are conditioned to give creepy men the benefit of the doubt, and consider intent before actions when it comes to men. A woman jokes about experiencing creepy behaviour, and men get angry because they either feel uncomfortable or targeted.  #8220;Not all men #8221; they must remind. Obviously generalisations but this is what I have observed. I know a lot of men love female comedians and a lot of male comedians make great content that isn #8217;t misogynistic.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I think a lot of people who win a lot are people who have a lot of time to sit and play, practice and get better - or even just play so much that it #8217;s inevitable that they will win occasionally. They don #8217;t consider that a lot of people don #8217;t have the ability to put that much time into the game, and it #8217;s not fair to penalise them for this. As other people have already pointed out - this is a *casual* game. There are no scoreboards or ranks. Your win rate is personal. People say having 5 crown skins shows other people you #8217;re skilled - but it really doesn #8217;t. You get 3 free crowns and if you play long enough most players, even people who don #8217;t have a lot of time, will get 2 wins. They buy one 5 crown skin and now everyone thinks they #8217;re very skilled players. There is no way to determine whether someone has 5 wins or 15 wins on sight. So winning is really a personal achievement. Some people need to get wins to feel like they achieved something, but some people just want to enjoy the game, and wear skins they like. Getting crowns is getting harder and harder as people get better at the game. People who don #8217;t have the time to put into it will never catch up, and that is extremely demoralising. This would be reasonable for a competitive game, but not a game like fall guys. I say this as someone with a lot of time and a fair amount of wins - I #8217;m not arguing for myself, I just want other players to be able to get the same enjoyment out of this game as I do. I have friends who don #8217;t like playing anymore because they don #8217;t have time to get better and feel like they #8217;re getting no payout for their time spent. Time is expensive - why would they waste it on this game when they #8217;re not seeing any return? The whole point of the game is basically  #8220;collect cosmetics #8221;. People are going to stop playing if they don #8217;t have access to half the interesting cosmetics. Awarding consistent play is the only way to guarantee the game doesn #8217;t die. Yes they have kudos, but you can buy kudos, so for people who have money but not time, it would be easier to buy kudos than earn them - this would take the fun out of playing. A way to slowly earn crows would, as other people have said  #8220;meet both sides Half way #8221; winning would still mean skilled players can get 10 crown costumes as soon as they come out, but other players have to save up slowly and maybe eventually will be able to afford half the costume before the shop resets. I just thought of an idea to maybe limit the amount of silver crowns a person can earn in a day - that way people who have a lot of free time but not much skill can #8217;t earn too much without winning. Maybe a bar that only fills when you get to the finals, and once it #8217;s maxed out you don #8217;t get anymore points, but when the shop resets if the bar was full, gives you one crown. If it #8217;s not full, you just carry on filling it. That way you can get up to one crown a day, as long as you play enough and get to the finals, but not a guaranteed crown every day. They will have to determine how much experience each final should give so as to make it reasonably challenging for the majority of players, I #8217;ll leave that maths to them.</TEXT>

    <TEXT> gt; not wealth or **time** I disagree. When I see someone with expensive crown skins, I assume they #8217;re someone who has a lot of free time, and some skill. I #8217;ve seen plenty of people wearing 10 crown outfits play terribly. But if you play enough you #8217;re bound to win. I #8217;m a mediocre player at best but I have 15 wins so far. I just happen to have a lot of spare time on my hands and I don #8217;t even play every day. There are a handful of truly skilled players who will consistently win. Then there #8217;s everyone else wearing expensive skins - people who just spend a lot of time on the game. Not everyone has that kind of time.</TEXT>

They don #8217;t even have stats - you have to keep track of your own win rate. Play  gt; earn  gt; buy skins.

    <TEXT>Not really. There are plenty of  #8220;good #8221; players here saying they agree with slow earning crowns. Myself included. If I put enough time in I get a win. But many people don #8217;t have the time I have. A lot of people I know irl have been put off the game because it #8217;s been getting harder and harder just to get to the finals, let alone to win. They #8217;re not seeing the rewards for the time they #8217;re putting into the game. Time they could be spending on other games. This game is going to die if there #8217;s no insensitive to keep playing once the novelty has worn off for 75% of players. I don #8217;t want this game to die. I want people to enjoy themselves, and I want my friends to enjoy spending their limited time on this game with me again.</TEXT>

    <TITLE>Proposal to hopefully appease both sides of the  #8220;participation award #8221; debate</TITLE>
    <DATE>2020-09-24 17:42:09</DATE>
    <TEXT>As the devs said in their response to an earlier thread about silver crowns, there are two issues; 1. People with little time or ability (casual and new gamers) wanting a way to slowly earn crowns - being awarded for dedication. 2. People not wanting their achievements diminished by people being able to access crowns without winning. I think I might have a solution. It takes 35,000 EXP points to get to level 40. In that time everyone can earn 3 crowns, the last one at 17,000 EXP. I propose that once a person reaches level 40, though you stop levelling, you should continue to get EXP, and the bar fills up to 10,000 EXP. **For every 10,000 EXP you earn after level 40, you get a crown.** It takes days of normal play to get that much EXP. More than enough to make it feel like a challenge. No need for fragments or silver crowns - just experience. I know for me personally, as someone who is level 40, sometimes it feels kind of pointless to play because I feel I have nothing to work towards. Yes, I can earn kudos or maybe get a few crowns, but it #8217;s just not as enjoyable. For people who want something exclusive for their wins - **Unlockable exclusive colour variants.** In the wardrobe, for every win you get, you gain a Golden Kudo token Considering there is already colour variants of some costumes, maybe they could be combined in one thumbnail, and when you select it another window opens with all the colour variants you own, and shows the exclusive ones you can buy. (This would also help clean up the wardrobe, as it #8217;s getting pretty cluttered already with doubles of each costume) Some colour variants should still be sold for kudos or crowns, but the fact that some will only be available to people who have won will hopefully make them feel that sense of achievement. And you shouldn #8217;t be able to buy the unlockable colour variants of outfits until you own at least one version of it. That means you #8217;d still need to earn 10 crowns before being able to even unlock the exclusive versions of 10 crown skins, but it also means you can get fancy versions of cheap outfits too. Ten wins means 10 crowns, you only need two for one full outfit. This also makes it a little easier for the devs to add more content without having to create more unique meshes. I #8217;d love to hear what other people think?</TEXT>

Now we #8217;re full on adults and when I call him cute he tries not to smile but he can #8217;t help it - it #8217;s so cute!</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Or, you know, the person who drew the comic just drew themselves and their partner, and that #8217;s just what they look like? Right now my husband has short hair and I (woman) have hair down to my ass, a few years ago, I was bald, a few years before that he had hair down to his shoulders. If I had drawn a little comic of us at either of the times we had uncommon hair lengths, would that suddenly make it more progressive? What if I drew one now with our hair this length? Are we  #8220;pointlessly gendered #8221;? Everything doesn #8217;t have to be subversive. Sometimes people are just drawing what *is*, and just because it #8217;s not what you think it *should be*, doesn #8217;t mean it #8217;s somehow problematic.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Because they are not biological and don #8217;t have more than one gender, there is no male or female, they are just gems. You can #8217;t even really call them asexual (in the reproduction sense, not the orientation sense) because besides Rose, they don #8217;t reproduce. They technically don #8217;t have a sex, and so  #8220;non binary #8221; is the best description. But they look and act as what we recognise as  #8220;feminine #8221; so that became their  #8220;default gender #8221; in our language, so they use she/her pronouns</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I know but they are aliens that don #8217;t have a sex, so it makes sense that they only have one kind of gender expression. While gender and sex are different, gender doesn #8217;t exist without sex - gender is a social construct informed by our reproductive roles (with a ton of cultural shit piled on top). A race that doesn #8217;t have sex wouldn #8217;t have any reason to have gender, and the closest thing we have to that is  #8220;non binary #8221;.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Yes, they are. They are both *no gender*.  #8220;Masculine #8221; and  #8220;feminine #8221; gender expressions only make sense when there are males and females. Even in the human non-binary spectrum, there are still only essentially 4 defined points - male, female, neither or both. Non binary genders are still heavily tied to the concept of masculinity and femininity - two things that only exist because we have two sexes. Again, a race that doesn #8217;t have even ONE sex can have no concept of gender. Gems just behave like gems. They aren #8217;t masculine or feminine, they just *are*. But put them in a human setting, and they are fixed to adopt our labels and language. None of them are female, but they all use  #8220;she/her #8221; pronouns because when comparing themselves to humans,  #8220;female #8221; is the closest to how they are seen by humans.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>**TL;DR: Girl id known most if my life stole money from me** When I turned like 15, I got some money as a gift, and I had put it all together in a card on a desk in my bedroom. This girl I #8217;d known since primary school, who lived just across the road from me, came over to say happy birthday. It was a little weird, because while we had always been *friendly*, I wouldn #8217;t have considered her a *friend*. We were talking in my room, and I went to see her out, but I left the room first, and she took a few seconds longer than needed to follow me out. I didn #8217;t think anything of it at the time. Later that evening I had gotten more money and went to put it with the rest. I counted it out and realised  #163;20 was missing. She was the only person who had been in my room that day. Even my younger sister was away at a sleepover. This girl had stolen from me. From my bedroom. On my birthday. She denied it and her mum believed her. My nan gave me another  #163;20 and told me she got it back but I knew she way lying to make me feel better. The next day in school the bitch has the audacity to *sit right next to me* in class and act like nothing happened. I basically threatened her in front of the class and made a very loud point about what she had done, and what I thought of her, and that I wanted my money back. I wanted to embarrass her infront of the class. She wouldn #8217;t move so I stood up aggressively but the teacher got involved and made her move. Later in the hall I cornered her and told her I didn #8217;t want her near me again. She stayed away from me after that.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>The saddest part is they #8217;re never even seen as part of the in-group by the in-group. It #8217;s all for nothing.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>That #8217;s the cult smile. You #8217;ll notice it a lot in cult members. Empty eyes, forced smile, a general sense of unease when you look at them for too long.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Can it be a mental obstacle course? And I #8217;m assuming they have infinite time... I #8217;d make them read *every single* fan fiction on fanfiction.net, as they are on the day they died, (including ones in foreign languages - they aren #8217;t allowed to use translators, they have to learn that language using only Rosetta Stone tapes) then ask them a single question about one randomly picked fic. They get 3 chances. Might take a few decades to get ready but hey. That #8217;s the price of escaping eternal damnation.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I mean, I #8217;d assume if you #8217;re cuddling like that in bed, she isn #8217;t going to mind your boner pressed against her. Honestly I probably wouldn #8217;t even notice unless he was literally grinding it on me, but I WOULD notice him moving away and leaving a huge cold gap between us, and that would *piss me off*</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I don #8217;t have a dick but if I was cuddling with a male friend I #8217;d probably be ok with it as long as I knew and trusted them well enough to know it didn #8217;t mean anything - and if I was spooning with them like that, it probably means we are that close.</TEXT>
