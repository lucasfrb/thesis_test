    <TEXT>As backstory: I bought my betta from Walmart just about a year ago. He lived in a tiny 2.5-gal aquarium with plastic plants for about a year. His fins were long and beautiful, but prolonged poor water quality and the presence of the plastic plants shredded his fins and never allowed them to regrow. Just over a week ago I moved him to a new 10-gallon aquarium. All the plants in there are real and the water quality is a thousand times better than what he #8217;s been living in. But his fins are only slowly coming back. How do I help him return to his former glory? When I looked back on my old photos, I forgot that he used to look that good! It #8217;s so sad that his fins have been so short for so long that I #8217;d forgotten what he used to look like. :(</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I #8217;ve never seen him bite his tail; it was the plastic plants and the poor water quality in the old 2.5 gal tank that left him this way. I #8217;ve fixed both now and he lives in a brand-new 10-gallon by himself and some real plants. How long do you think it will take for him to return to his former glory? Will his tail ever grow as long?</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Thank you! :) I keep my nails from breaking in these ways: 1. I keep nail polish on almost all of the time. Nail polish acts like a splint for your nails, making them stronger. 2. When painting my nails, I coat the undersides of the nails in nail polish. It waterproofs the nail and it also further serves to strengthen it! Nail polish also never chips when you do this. 2. I never use nail hardeners. Nail hardeners make nails brittle and easily broken. 4. I keep my nails moisturized with jojoba oil and random lotions I use. Moisturizing nails allows them to flex when stressed, rather than breaking. 5. I avoid doing things that might break my nails! E.g. using my nails as tools, lifting heavy things with my nails, and being careful after a shower. Hope that helps!</TEXT>

    <TEXT>That looks like a reaction I get as well. Tiny, itchy, tender bubbles just under the skin? Yeah, that #8217;s *dyshidrotic eczema*, a form of eczema that is less common than regular eczema. It typically occurs on the palms and soles of hands and feet. However, I #8217;ve found that it can pop up around the nail as well as under the nail. [This webpage might help you out, but I recommend doing more research. ](https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/dyshidrosis/symptoms-causes/syc-20352342) My dyshidrosis is triggered by stress, dander, and pollen, but it looks like yours is triggered by whatever is in that gel polish. My advice to you? **Get rid of that gel polish.** Don #8217;t wait to see whether you #8217;re sensitive to the builder base or the gel polish itself. It doesn #8217;t matter. Even if you #8217;re careful in the future when applying gel to your nails, it #8217;s inevitable that you #8217;re going to get some on your skin. And when that happens, your skin is going to react again. And again. And each time your skin reacts, it #8217;s going to get worse. It #8217;s not too bad now. My dyshidrosis wasn #8217;t too bad at first, either. But this is a condition that is chronic - it #8217;s going to stay with you the rest of your life - and every time you are exposed to that allergen, your skin is not going to like it. Dyshidrosis affects two of my fingers. The skin around two of my nails becomes bubbly and raised whenever I pet a dog and don #8217;t wash my hands. The nail beds are permanently damaged from episodes I #8217;ve had in the past, and those two nails are permanently ridged and pitted from it. Don #8217;t be me. **Take off those gel nails.** P.S. Cortizone is best for treating this condition.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Absolutely! I despise having to rub and rub at my nails with acetone every week when I use regular base coat, so I use the peel-off to make removing my manicure a breeze. This peel-off base coat goes on clear and dries within a minute or two. As long as you #8217;re careful, your mani will last five to seven days! Just make sure to be careful in the shower and avoid using your nails as tools to keep your mani from peeling up prematurely. :)</TEXT>

    <TEXT>**Short explanation:** *If you have already been using gel on your nails and have experienced no problems, then it is likely that you will continue to experience no problems in the future with gel.* **Longer explanation:** An allergy is a condition in which the immune system reacts abnormally to a foreign substance. Contact dermatitis is a type of allergic reaction. Everyone #8217;s immune system is different, but some are more sensitive to some substances than others. Usually, a person does not discover that they are allergic to something until they come into contact with that substance. Seeing as you have already been using gel polishes with no problem, it is likely that you will continue to have no problems with gel. However, you may DEVELOP an allergy to gel polish, particularly if you use it a lot and it is a cheap formula. There is nothing you can do to avoid that, except to catch the allergy early and stop using that particular gel polish to keep the allergy from getting worse. I once developed an allergy to guinea pigs after months of daily exposure to them. A friend developed an allergic reaction to cheap metal earrings after wearing them for weeks. However, if you are not a person who is predisposed to having allergies, I would not worry about that possibility. The ingredients within the gel *do* matter. However, it is hard to pinpoint an allergy to individual ingredients within gel unless you go to a doctor and have a skin patch test done to test yourself for allergies. **Source:** I am a person with lots of allergies.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>No problem, u/PrincessCelestial! Always glad to provide information. :) I do not have personal experience with gel polish allergies. However, a cursory search online tells me that gel polish undergoes a polymerization reaction as it is cured. It is definitely possible that the ingredients within uncured gel polish can cause a reaction that cured polish would not. I would be careful to keep uncured gel polish off my skin, fully cure it every time, and watch for signs of an allergic reaction.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Hello, I have a question. I also have damaged ligaments in my left knee. It occurred because I went walking for a few hours in ill-fitting shoes. The soles of the shoes were worn down in a tilted manner and it messed up my knee. I didn #8217;t notice until the next day when my knee was swollen and tender. I have since thrown away the shoes and been careful with putting weight on my knee. The soreness and tenderness has not gone away, however. It has been over a month. My question is, how long did it take for your nephew to heal the damage to his knee ligaments? And do you have any advice for me? I do not know what I should do. Thank you.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Has your nail always grown like this, or was there a childhood accident or something of that nature that damaged the nail matrix? I #8217;d recommend acrylic if you want length.

    <TEXT>I do not use gel for the simple reason that buffing the nail thins it out. This will make your nails weak and flexible. Further, improperly-removed gel polish will damage the nail surface. The best option would be to take a break from gel, paint with nail polish, and grow your nails out for a few months, which will restore the thickness and strength of your natural nails. However, if you cannot abide getting rid of gel for a few months, you can use [UNT Peel-Off base coat, found on Amazon and some other places.](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B002BZ361W/ref=cm_sw_r_cp_awdb_t1_Fj2vCbE03D0TR) It #8217;s a little expensive right now... I bought some a couple of months ago and it was like $10 or something. Don #8217;t know why the price jumped. Anyways, using this peel-off base coat underneath a gel manicure will make it much easier to remove the mani and will nullify the need to buff your nails before you begin. However, your mani will not last as long - maybe a week or so before it wants to come off. I would recommend [this video which uses the UNT-gel technique I just described ](https://youtu.be/Uj_If9Rd83Y) to see that in action. Hope this helps!</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I #8217;m not a bartender, but I do work a job where I must wash my hands often. My nails are almost always painted to protect from water and work-related dings. I suggest painting your nails to help protect them for sure! If you do a bad nail painting job or use bad drugstore products, however, it will flake and chip easily. Be careful to be neat and seal the edges of the nail, especially the free edge, to get the most waterproofing possible. Gel polish is a long-lasting but expensive option if you go to a nail salon. Good luck with your nail endeavors! Edit: If your nails get brittle and break easily when you paint them, make sure you #8217;re not using a nail hardener base coat or anything of the sort. Nail hardeners lead to breakage for most people (for some people, it helps bolster their weak nails).</TEXT>

    <TEXT>The first picture was taken in late November 2018 and the second was taken today! I #8217;m proud of my growth progress. *(look at that thumb nail!)* I #8217;ve had a few mishaps along the way, such as a nail break on my ring finger in January-ish, and changing my nail shape. Going from squoval to oval-shaped took off a lot of length. I #8217;ve found this is the best shape to enhance my finger #8217;s natural shape and keep my nails from breaking. I #8217;m thinking this is the longest I #8217;ll let it get, as more length would prohibitive on my activities, but I do enjoy this length! **To grow your nails:** - Wear nail polish all the time. Naked nails break more easily. - Nails are jewels, not tools. *Don #8217;t use your nails to open things.* Use your knuckles to open drawers, push the microwave button, etc. - Water weakens your nails; avoid stressing your nails after a shower. - Use oil on your cuticles and under your nail every day. I use jojoba oil when I #8217;m pampering my nails, but the coconut oil I use every day for my hair and skin also moisturizes my nails well. - Avoid nail hardeners/strengtheners. They will cause your nails to become brittle and break. (Exceptions are for people who have very thin nails.) Hope this helps!</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Thank you! To answer your question: - Base coat - Seche Clear - Top coat - Seche Vite Note: There is a slight problem with Seche Vite and shrinkage. The edge of the topcoat near the cuticle will pull back slightly as it dries, and it can get a bit annoying. But other than that, this basecoat and topcoat set work wonderfully together to keep my nails from chipping. If you got your clearcoat from a drugstore, I would recommend ordering something online instead. I #8217;ve never found that drugstore nail products are that good, to be honest. Additionally, it is vital that you *coat the edge and some of the underside of your nail if you can when painting your nails.* SimplyNailogical calls this  #8220;capping the ends. #8220; if you don #8217;t cap your ends, your nail polish will chip within a day or two. If you do cap your ends, it can last a week or more. Good luck!</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Sure! So, using nail hardeners is bad because they cause nails to break more easily. This is not very intuitive because people typically think that a hard nail would be strong, right? Well, that #8217;s not necessarily true. **It is more important for a nail to be *flexible* than for a nail to be *hard*.** Using jojoba oil and avoiding nail hardeners are the best things you can do for your nails. Flexible nails will *flex* rather than break when you accidentally bend them. Sometimes I am sure I have broken my nail when I accidentally jam it against a door and feel a pain in my finger, but then I look and my nail is unharmed! My nail was unharmed because it bent when it hit the door. Now, if I had been using a nail hardener, that would not have happened. My nail would have broken because nail hardeners don #8217;t let the nail flex. For people with *very* thin and weak nails, nail hardeners can be beneficial. For most people, they are not.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Why do you have thin nails? Is it the result of eczema on your fingers, poor diet, acrylic use, over-buffing, or something else? Have you always had thin nails, or is it something that developed recently? This is important to know in order to properly treat your problem. In your case, given that you have paper-thin nails, using nail hardener is definitely beneficial. Nail hardener prevents paper-thin nails from breaking while they grow out. Using cuticle oil is also beneficial for your nails, too. It is good for your nails and surrounding skin to stay moisturized. They should not counteract each other. However, I would like to dispel the notion that using nail hardener will eventually make your nails grow harder. It will not. It only makes the existing nail that you have painted it on harder through chemical means. If you want to make your nails grow in healthier and stronger, you need to figure out why your nails are growing in so thin.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Absolutely beautiful color! What is the color? I love the dark, mysterious shimmer. I am so glad that you got your Seche base and top coat in the mail and are making good use of it! Yes, the topcoat is thick, shiny, and protects manicures like no other. Your mani will definitely last a while. As it should, because it #8217;s so gorgeous! As your nails grow out past the edge of your finger, try to practice a method called capping. It #8217;s when you  #8220;cap #8221; the end of your nail with nail polish with every layer to protect your manicure from chipping and to make it last even longer. it #8217;s not easy to do on short nails, but as your nail grows, it will become possible. Use a delicate touch so it doesn #8217;t look thick and clumpy, but be sure to cover the free edge of the nail with at least one layer of color and one layer of topcoat. Looking forward to seeing your nail growth in a few weeks! :)</TEXT>

    <TITLE>Unable to find a fairly popular HP fanfiction. Help?</TITLE>
    <DATE>2020-04-08 05:16:34</DATE>
    <TEXT>I cannot, for the life of me, find this story. It was very popular and it was fairly long. Please help? \-- In the story, Harry Potter lost it all after the war. He wandered the ruined halls of Hogwarts and decided that he had nothing left to live for. After speaking to Dumbledore's portrait in the Headmaster's office, he found a magic that could send his soul back to his younger self. The thing was, in order to do the magic, he had to send his soul through a force field that would shatter if any matter touched it. He Avada Kedavra'd himself and his soul was sent through the field. A moment later, his wand touched the field and shattered it. Back in the past, his soul came to his younger self (10 years old) in a dream. His younger self consented to be merged, and his younger and older selves merged into one. The story is his journey through Hogwarts. He mentors his friends and carefully conceals his true identity, but he slips every so often. Eventually, his friends discover his true identity and still accept him. The love amongst his friends was amazing.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>There #8217;s a couple shark species like tiger and bull sharks that are more aggressive and could possibly fit your description, if you squint. but for the most part you #8217;re wrong. Sharks tend to avoid humans as we are not very appealing to them. The vast majority of shark  #8220;attacks #8221; end after one bite (and the shark realizes it was mistaken/doesn #8217;t want to eat you). Sharks don #8217;t get randomly aggressive. Attitudes like yours are the reason why 100 million sharks die a year and the general public doesn #8217;t care.</TEXT>

I #8217;ve been having so much fun with this lately, I hope you #8217;ve kept doing these things. We #8217;re at 120 followers and growing fast! I hope I #8217;ve surpassed 1,000 a year from now. I #8217;m counting on you. I #8217;m lonely sometimes. I look in the mirror and don #8217;t like what I see sometimes. I hope these things are a bit better a year from now. Just keep working at your goals. Leave the house sometimes. Go for a run. Eat right. You know how it is. And for God #8217;s sake, save your money, you have applications to do! Good luck!

    <TITLE>Hi, I #8217;m looking for a popular and incredible clip from this subreddit, can you help me find it?</TITLE>
    <DATE>2020-10-16 17:02:43</DATE>
    <TEXT>Hello, I #8217;ve been searching the hell out of this subreddit for a while now and I can #8217;t find this clip!!! Please help! In the clip, a survivor with a flashlight makes a miracle save. Through a hole in the wall of a shack, the survivor (who is inside the shack) blinds the killer (who is outside of the shack) and makes the killer drop the survivor. The fact that the survivor made this flashlight save *through a hole in the wall* is crazy. Does anyone remember this popular clip from this subreddit and have a link? I searched  #8220;flashlight, #8221;  #8220;hole, #8221; and various combinations of words, but I can #8217;t find it. I think the title was something like  #8220;I can #8217;t believe this worked #8221; or something like that. Thanks!</TEXT>
