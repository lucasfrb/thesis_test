He insisted in paying for everything for everyone all the time (always paid for dinners out with friends, bought ridiculously expensive gifts, and always had to have top of the line everything). I paid off his credit cards so we could close on the house we were building. Then I caught him cheating 3 months later and he'd racked it back up higher than what I'd paid off. He was sending her gifts and money and who knows what else. I'd never be able to sleep at night if I were like that (and by the way, he kept it all hidden from me).</TEXT>

    <TEXT>We'd been married for almost a year when I had major surgery then suffered some mental health issues. Piecing it together later, that's when he chose to turn me into an abusive monster to the budding mistress (in turn, she transformed her husband into an abusive monster). So while I was working night shift, they were on the phone for 5-7 hours a night, consoling each other for their traumatic marriages (this, by the way, was their narcissistic way of excusing their shitty behavior). The way I caught him was I was driving home one night and saw him at the end of our street on the phone. He didn't see me. I thought it strange that he'd be at the end of the street. It was well over an hour by the time he came home with some lame excuse why he was late. By then, I'd already been through the cell phone bills and found her number. I didn't confront hom right away. Within a week, my best friend called the number and got her name, finding out they were friends online. When I confronted him, he denied it. I told him he was lying and left the house. Unfortunately, I let his lies suck me back in for another 4 months. After that we divorced and he married her. But I'm getting a boatload in alimony and they're each stuck with a turd who thinks cheating is acceptable.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>The judge in my divorce case sentenced my ex to 90 days stayed if he followed her most recent court order (he'd failed to follow her first). 6 months later, after not following her order in the slightest, and failing to show up for hearings, we finally got him to return to the state and testify why. She clearly didn't like his drivel, because she obliged our request for 7 days in with no bail (still leaves 83 days to serve if he fails to follow her orders). Miraculously! After he got out of jail, he started complying with her orders! THAT'S the kind of judge I want. Take no shit.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>That I was the cause of my ex husband cheating on me. Cheaters always blame the other person because they can't take responsibility for their own shit. I had a mental health crisis and instead of helping me, he sought out companionship elsewhere. I struggle with this because no one can make another person do something like that - he's responsible for his own actions. I just toss around a lot of what ifs. Also, he was mentally and financially abusive, so I'm better off anyway.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I work night shift in clients' homes and don't care to use their kitchen for my meals, even though they're all very accommodating. I bring my meals with me in a little cooler with ice packs. Recently I've been making cold protein bowls. Although I include meat in mine, it's really not necessary. One version is; smoked chicken, quinoa, spinach, black beans, hard boiled egg, carrot, zucchini, grilled artichokes, and a lemony herb dressing. I found a couple new dressings I'm excited to try - an Asian inspired dressing would be great. The other protein bowl I've been making is seafood based - whatever seafood I can find on sale (recently found 5 pound of imitation crabmeat for $4.99!!!) I also add quinoa, spinach, edamame, carrot, zucchini, mango, avocado, and a dressing. I like yum yum sauce and I'm positive it can be made very easily when ingredients in the house. Rice would work well in place of quinoa. I don't use it because I have some dietary issues. The other thing I have is a little 20 ounce lunch crock pot. As I said, I'm given access to the families kitchens, I just don't feel right about using them. Especially when everyone in the house is asleep. The crock pot allows me to bring leftovers and keep them warm. Not sure if your SO has access to plug one in.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Addiction is a complex problem, and it's rarely about choices. Many vulnerable youth do not develop adequate or appropriate coping skills. Combine that with an unstable homelife, maybe abuse, probably mental illness, and you've got yourself a recipe for susceptibility. No one takes illicit (or even prescription) drugs with the intention of becoming addicted. Our best bet as a society is prevention. But it takes so much more than people realize, and we've demonstrated that we do not value education. Instead we'd like a quick fix.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>One of my favorite stores (in the Minneapolis area) is a food rescue store. Often the dates are at or nearing expiration, but just as often, it's overstock. We've had only one time where a product was not edible (and the 2 other items in the same lot were fine). We are thrilled with it, I just wish it was closer than 20 minutes from my house, I'd shop there more frequently.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Maybe you have a different belief of what PTSD is? Have you ever been through anything traumatic that stuck with you? Sometimes it's really hard to recognize. I'll throw a couple of my experiences out there just so you can see the difference. 1 - I was in a six car accident. That was very obvious to me and really affected me for a number of years. It's been 21 years though and I'm not as bad as I was, though sometimes I'm a nervous passenger. 2 - I was date raped 14 years ago. That one seems obvious, right? I didn't feel any effects from it (I'm not saying it didn't upset or hurt me, just no PTSD. And this is where I'd expect it the most!) 3 - my (ex) husband cheated on me and left me to marry his mistress. THAT was probably the worst one for me. It's been about 4 years and I still feel the effects of that in the most insidious ways - who is my boyfriend talking to? Why is he online so much? Where is he going? Why is he gone so long? It's not his fault that I feel this way, it's a trauma response (and since we were high school classmates and friends through all this, he knows what I've gone through and has seen improvement in me). Love you u/MinnesotaMikeP My point is that trauma responses are all different and unpredictable. Perhaps this one doesn't affect you in ways that another might? If you feel like nothing causes any trauma response in you but it should, perhaps counseling would be beneficial.</TEXT>
