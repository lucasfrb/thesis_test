    <TEXT>Hi, I am a native speaker. I have not read the letter thoroughly. Just skimmed it a bit. Here is what I found. The letter is written from Karachi Manora. The writer is an Uncle of the receiver. Most probably the receiver is not in this country(Pakistan) because the writer talks about aeroplanes. Were they really so easy travel back in the day??? 1929? He is talking about birth certificate of the receiver, that he has problems getting. He talks about some government officer Dawood Sahib who is helping him and talking about some magistrate who will help get the certificate. The receiver is some student because at the end of the letter, he talks about being calm during exams etc. The writer is not a native speaker of Urdu. He makes many spelling mistakes. Also his urdu is not good. It has a Bengali, Meemon kind of accent.</TEXT>
