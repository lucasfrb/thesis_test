    <TEXT>Could you elaborate on your plans for player built corporations? Will there be politics/trade/wars between player built organisations? Also will you ever include a way to see what instance your in? So you can switch to your friend/groups instance rather than being in a private group instance with no other players. I think the social aspect of elite is slightly underwhelming at the moment. Also I'd love to know if we'd ever be able to build bases on planet/asteroid surfaces in our organisations.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>From the petition: One of the main reasons everyone loved the Battlefield 1 trailer was because it showed that the series was taking a bold step into the past. By taking the franchise into an older era DICE was demonstrating their willingness to seriously change the game, people were excited because they would have a chance to experience a truly different kind of game set in an exciting and different kind of war. People expected a new kind of gameplay experience with bolt action rifles and trench warfare mixed with the combined arms warfare which has always made Battlefield so great. Perhaps this is what DICE originally wanted when they came to EA with their proposal, but (as usual) the fat cats at EA rejected this clearly great proposal. Now, instead of getting a mixture between an authentic World War One experience and a Battlefield game we are getting Battlefield 4 with a World War One skin. Dice Producer Aleks Grondal said "We're not making a documentary on the Great War", this petition is not asking for total realism (Verdun (2015) does a good job of that). We just want a little more of World War One experience. From what we have seen so far, there is no sign of trench warfare, only one class has bolt action rifles and most of these appear to be sniper configurations. The tanks travel way to quickly and are as a result (as Level Cap suggested (https://youtu.be/DafQacAwAwI?t=60 over powered). So far we have seen no sign of artillery outside of the single player game (This killed 80% of soldiers that died in WW1) and would make a great counter to the tanks as well as adding to the immersion of Battlefield 1. We are very happy DICE decided to choose World War One as a setting, but we don't want a reskin of a modern military shooter. Wishlist: - Some Trench Warfare should be present in Battlefield 1 (Perhaps a different game mode or map), including a 'going over the top' moment. - Nation specific bolt action rifles with iron sights should be available for all classes (E.g. Lee Enfield for Britain, Gewehr 98 for Germany), but for balance sake the damage/stats should be modified so that they are less effective at long ranges. - Artillery should have more of a presence in the game. - Slower tanks</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Ok, well put. Firstly, I think you could potentially nerf the all class bolt action rifles so that they are only effective at short/medium range. If DICE really thinks that it would break the game balance that bad then perhaps give us a authenitc/hardcore mode with trenches and bolt action rifles? I think it would actually make for some fun gameplay (See - Verdun).</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Premium/dlc should still be there for guns and skins just not maps because the dlc maps die as everyone is locked out of playing them. It divides the community</TEXT>

    <TITLE>In Battlefield 4 we had different aircraft for each country/type. In Battlefield 1 we get the same plane with different symbols? Annoying, but I would be OK with this if more skins came as DLC instead of DLC maps (That splits up the community). Thoughts?</TITLE>

    <TEXT>Disagree with 2 (Kinda defeats the point of class types and means people can't judge your fire power by your class skin), but I can see 1 being cool especially if they had some kind of body searching animation (Like far cry).

    <TITLE>[BF1] BATTLEFIELD 1: WISHLIST (Post Beta)</TITLE>
    <DATE>2016-09-09 21:29:30</DATE>
    <TEXT>My personal wishlist, feel free to add your own wishes in the comments and discuss my choices. Relatively easy to add features: Medic - Remove 'Press space bar to skip revive' option - Reintroduce 3D revive symbols for dead soldiers Rush - More players in Rush - Less tanks in Rush - When you call in artillery on the M-Coms, nothing happens (please add big artillery!) More difficult to change features (But important none the less): The following features would make the game feel more like it is set in WW1 (The USP - Unique Selling Point of Battlefield 1). Gore - if not full gore then at least the option to keep soldiers dead bodies on the Battlefield. Trench Warfare - A little more trench warfare would be nice (hopefully this will be in the 'Operations' game mode). Fantasy wishes (This will probably never happen): Ability to use long range artillery/howitzers like the ones you see in the trailer (Imagine if they had some long range artillery at E on the Sinai map) All class rifle access - Allow all classes the ability to use the bolt action rifle (with iron sights/no scope attachments) that their country used, for example, British Empire: SMLE, Germany: G98. NOTE: I understand that DICE is trying to clearly define the optimal engagement distance between the classes (Assault close range ect), but by reducing the damage/increasing the fall off of these all class rifles they can dissuade players from using them too much. DICE can change the stats on these bolt action rifles so they can be bad at medium/long ranges, this would encourage players to use their class specific weapons). Did I miss anything?</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I actually think Operations does it better than Verduns mode. All Battlefield needs in my opinion is some trench warfare with a period of stalemate before the 'over the top' rush. I'd love to walk around a complex trench system with 32 other players, waiting for 0 hour and the whistles to go over the top. Imagine also they added a really dark night time trench map, people could use the flare gun to light up no mans land. So many ww1 possibilities that haven't yet been explored in the single or multi player.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I understand why you think like that, lots of people do and its partially why we haven't seen any ww1 games up until now. It can all be made fun/balanced in the level design. They can easily add cover and lanes in the level ect (or even underground paths). I really doubt that it'd be much harder to play than some of the maps that Battlefield has made already. For example, on Monte Grappa on Operations (42 player version) there's a section where one team has to take a bunker. There are only two entrances which can easily be camped. Its so much harder than having a wide open trench map, and they already have stuff like that in the game. Really the trench warfare is just aesthetics, they can do what they like to make the level itself balanced.</TEXT>

If you want to play something worse than that try Monte Grappa 42 players, there's a section where one team is in a bunker and the other team only has two tiny narrow corridors to get inside. Its so hard to break through 90% of the time defenders win.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>From what I know EA rejected the initial pitch for Battlefield 1 because 'trench warfare is no fun' - so that is why they removed so much of it from the game. Unfortunately I think they will probably still avoid it as much as possible in the dlc. My guess is the Verdun levels will revolve around the forts (Duamont) and be CQC which sucks :( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JYyc6ZPBmIY Maybe they will have a Somme/Ypres dlc later, although probably not.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I agree, I realize that if the maps are designed poorly it would be totally one sided and broken. But actually its the opposite, most people are 'neglecting' the fact that all multiplayer maps can be designed to work/be fun. That just comes down to how Dice designs the lanes/cover. For example, you could have some rubble in no mans land or an underground mine that you can use (and maybe explode the people who stand above it?). My point is the trench stuff is just aesthetics, level designers can make the map work it wouldn't necessarily be broken/grindy.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>This is true I think it depends what you mean by tactical. I guess you could use ['storm trooper'](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stormtrooper) tactics to reach enemy trenches, use tanks as cover, smoke grenades or creeping barrage artillery/motors, is that 'tactical'?</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I know a lot of people don't really care about the historical elements of Battlefield 1, but there's a good chunk of us in the community that would really like to see bolt action rifles (with ironsights only) as unlocks for all classes. Apart from adding to the historical feel it would also open up a lot of gun unlock depth, there were many types of bolt action rifles used in ww1 by all factions. If we can't get this feature into the core game, then could we at least have a 'historical' option for custom servers? Allowing medics/assault/support classes to use bolt actions would really be nice.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>1. 'Historical mode' please! (Trenches and authentic weapons, kinda like this https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WNzcsdpQY84) If that is too much to ask then please add SIR as a main game type and Dice host some servers, everyone i'v spoken to who has tried it loves it but its near impossible for many people to join because of lack of servers. 2. Reintroduce the digging shovel, maybe in CTE at least? I understand it was once a feature in early alpha. 3. Operations in server browsers (so we can get SIR mode) 3. Oh and maybe some outfit customization, choose different styles based on real ww1 uniforms that'd be nice.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I think the game shipped with too few weapons, personally I think you should consider adding some bolt actions for all classes (with ironsights) to add unlock depth, although i'm sure this is controversial I doubt that many people would play with the bolt actions, and without scopes they are limited to medium/close range and so wouldn't mess up the class range balance too much. Off topic notes: Future weapon/gadget suggestions: - Could you guys add some deployable barb wire/sandbags for support? - Could we see a return of the digging shovel in CTE (I understand it was in an early version of the game)? - People are complaining about gas, maybe only one gas grenade, but add a 'gas mortar' or deployable gas canister that allows gas to drift in the wind (like they did in ww1). - At some point could you guys add a trench CTF map? Imagine one team must take a prisoner/plans from the enemy underground bunker and return it to their own. This would recreate the stalemate and trench raids of normal ww1 warfare. - I think the game is lacking the visual authenticity that you guys gave Battlefront (In Battlefront, you made sure that all the outfits/weapons were super accurate to the movies), however the uniforms in bf1 are unusual. I would love to see custom regiment uniform unlocks at some point, although i doubt that would happen unless you guys do a second season or something. - Also please don't forget Somme/Flanders in dlc! PS Thanks for adding the bipod to the lewis gun low weight variant in a recent update! I was the one requesting that you added it :)</TEXT>

    <TEXT>They are very rare, as far as I know they have only happened on Jack's SIR server when a few guys organised the whole thing (which is near impossible with griefers). The one in pic related was the biggest battle ever because Jack Frags was streaming during the event and joined in himself, however nothing has come close to it since. DannyonPC recorded it https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WNzcsdpQY84 Jack Frags streamed the whole event that night (starting 2:12:28) https://www.twitch.tv/jackfrags/v/108371442, that's the full thing. And this https://youtu.be/adJd9s-kbe0?t=108 cinematic was recorded that day too. Hopefully it becomes some kind of a game mode some day, although I doubt it.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Sweet dude, that would be amazing. Practically speaking i'm sure there are many problems with the design, I just quickly put it together in ms paint. With the snipers nest, could you use a ladder? Or would you have to redesign it with stairs? When you make maps do you make an orange version to play test first? Maybe at some point down the road you could email Valve and ask for some of the assets they used in the films. Or are they all available in SFM? Either way, good luck man. If you're really serious about this then please add me!! I'd love to help you play test (I just sent you a PM with my Steam) :D By the way have you got any custom maps you've made up on the steam workshop? I'm curious to see them</TEXT>

    <TEXT>It is great, I actually briefly spoke to DICE_Stefan in game about your complaints. He said "Battlefield 1 Is primarily a Battlefield game, secondarily a ww1 game". Although I actually met him playing Back to Basics (and he said he really enjoyed it - and was interested in combining it with Operations). While the game is good, I feel that they missed a lot of oppertunities (For instance, there's no 'Real over the top' feeling in either single player or multiplayer (unless you are lucky enough to catch the very first few seconds of Quinting Scar, Operations). I think they need a trench warfare mode where players actually use trenches (they have firing steps so players can shoot over the top). And a period of stalemate before 'over the top' moments.</TEXT>

    <TEXT> gt; Now that I think of it as a Battlefield first, WWI second kind of game. It really makes sense. Yeah but I still think they tried too hard to make it a 'battlefield' game.

    <TEXT>I'm sure this is why they did it, I still think it would be nice to have *one* more realistic trench warfare map in dlc. It doesn't have to be perfect, but it'd be nice to experience that 'over the top' rush in a ww1 game. [Like this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPtVNDvwGMo).

It'd be like [D-Day maps in ww2 games](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GaHWiA9Gerc), the first part is hard for attackers, but once they over come the defenses the push is easier.

    <TEXT>To those who have doubts that real trench warfare can be balanced, take a look at [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GaHWiA9Gerc). It's gameplay from a ww2 D-Day level. I imagine a well balanced trench map would play something like this (the teams using smoke/tanks for cover to push up). It might be hard for the attacking team, but not impossible/too campy if it is designed right. In my opinion to miss out on something like this in a ww1 game would be a shame, even if it's just one or two maps.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>True... I guess destruction does complicate things. Maybe they could make the body disappear when the ground underneath is destroyed, your right though that would be hard to get around (if you you used frozen bodies). Then again, look at a game like Killing Floor, that only uses thousands of ragdols and it seems to run smoothly. Perhaps all they need to do is continue the current system but just let bodies stay around for a bit longer, how ever much people's pcs can take.</TEXT>

    <TITLE>Feedback for Fort De Veux</TITLE>
    <DATE>2017-02-23 18:42:16</DATE>
    <TEXT>Visuals: The map looks amazing, although I would like to point out that the entire area around Verdun for miles in either direction was totally muddy, I think the mud area should be extended in French spawn and beyond (basically, less grass, more mud) Also, I think you should increase the amount of ambient artillery by a lot. Verdun had some of the most intense bombardments of the war, all focused on a small area. The majority of people died at Verdun to artillery and I think its important to show this somehow, adding loads more ambient artillery (all over the map/in the out of bounds areas) would help drive home this point about the battle. At there is a little bit of ambient artillery around the German spawn and on top of the fort, this is nice but the intensity is too small. Increasing it by at least 10x would create a much more authentic Verdun experience. Gameplay: The map is too circular imo, it's like the reverse of Suez. It feels like a merry go round with both teams running in swarms around the map rarely colliding. I think you guys should try and make it a bit more linear like Metro was. Overall the map is very nice, but I think you should take these improvements into consideration before you release it to the main game.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Ok, that's fair enough. I suppose it was mid battle. Maybe a bit more ambient artillery though? I know there's already quite a bit but maybe some more will really drive home the ferocity of the battle. (I noticed that there wasn't any ambient artillery at the French spawn area, while there was artillery in the German area, surly it would likely be the other way around as Germans are attacking?) Also, I don't know whether the road behind the French spawn was a conscious reference to Voie Sacr #233;e (the sacred road) which carried troops and ammunition constantly throughout the battle, if this is the case then maybe some more upturned carts along the route w/artillery bombardments around the road. Just some feed back! Keep it up, it looks fantastic :) PS: Consider increasing the dead body count/add bodies around the map, I made a thread about it today [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/battlefield_one/comments/5vhshk/dice_could_you_try_upping_the_dead_body_limit_in/)</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I think adding a 'stalemate' period before one team goes over the top at the start of the round (say 2 - 5 mins), would really add to the dramatic tension and really add to that 'over the top' rush. During this time each team can take pot shots at each other with snipers and generally experience the true stalemate that was trench warfare. I really hope some devs read this and consider adding it, the current system (where you are frozen for a few seconds) feels a little lacking and I really think allowing players to walk around their trenches (but not go over the top) would add to the ww1 experience!

    <TEXT>Fantastic, however I think Dice need to be aware of the non Premium users, those guys have 0 reason to play at the moment. They could do with some new free weapons at least (if not another free map). I really hope premium wont be a thing in the next Battlefield, it divides the player base and kills the maps/modes locked behind premium eventually. Hopefully, they get a decent cosmetic system going and make money through that. If they implemented it into Battlefield 1 they could make release different real life regiment skins that cost money to use. I'm sure that would in the long run make more money than everyone paying once for premium.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>DICE should make a competitive Battlefield game that is separate for that kind of stuff imo. If battlefield was really going to be competitive they would remove mortars and remove gas and remove so much stuff to the point where it would just be csgo with tanks. I'm not against competitive I just feel like its quite incompatible with the stuff that I like in Battlefield (I'v been playing since Battlefield 2 also), I play Battlefield for the immersion and the battle experience. Not that your opinion is wrong or anything, i just wish they had a competitive mode with certain mechanics disabled or an entirely new game for competitive play.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>First of all, thanks Dice for adding a trench map! Hopefully you guys can release this one to non premium members at some point I feel for those guys. Feedback so far: - The combat needs to be more focused, at the moment, the map feels a little bit wide, it feels too easy to flank the trenches. By making the map a little bit narrower this should help focus the combat along the front line of the trench. There shouldn't really be many opportunities to flank the trenches (flanking stopped after the 'race to the sea' in 1914). - I understand you have technical problems making it feel like night, but currently it is just too bright/blue. Hopefully you guys can make it really dark. - Could you add a howitzer (or two?) on either side behind the front lines + artillery pieces and machine gun posts? I feel like this might add to the trench experience. - Dead bodies like in the trailer would really make this map feel authentic. - I actually think less cover between the two front lines would make this map feel better, (and maybe make the the two trenches closer). Also I think combat in no mans land should be focused to one point rather than two, if not then they should be brought closer together somehow. - Just a minor gripe, those search lights are really historically inaccurate. Can you imagine how quickly they would get destroyed on the front line? They existed but please place them further behind the front line. I love your inclusion of the flares in the background, I kind of wish they were more of a feature and actually illuminated the map, but again i understand you have some technical limitations. Thanks Dice and best of luck polishing this map! I think it could be really great with a little bit of work. I really hope you add this to frontlines/ or an operation because I feel that would add the frontline feel that this map needs.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>The flares should illuminate the battlefield, that would be epic. The searchlights wouldn't have existed like that on the front lines, they would get destroyed in seconds. They were used way behind the front lines. Flares were more common for lighting up the trenches at night.</TEXT>

This less is more attitude is stifling AAA games, they are too afraid to experiment.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>When the player count begins to go down after launch, it becomes harder to find game modes with less player counts because those modes tend to die off more easily. If there are only 12 players it only takes a few players to leave for the match to become unplayable. If the servers just ran 64 players with all modes, then none would die off because people wouldn't have to search for either a 64 player count game or a 12/24 player count game.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>The screenshots are from december 2016 (not 17, oops) when 64 players organized a trench battle (they dug trenches with limpet chatges and then fought). It was a ton of fun and nothing like it has happened since. Dive at one point said they were going to add shovels that dug into cte for this sort of thing but it never happened. These vids were both taken during the event and jack frags streamed some of it also https://youtu.be/adJd9s-kbe0?t=106 https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WNzcsdpQY84 amp;t=30s</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I'm sure some of these are already planned but just in case they are not hopefully someone at CIG will read this. - Rain and other weather effects (like droplets from flying through clouds) hitting the windscreen of ships - also cracked windscreens - Falling out of seats/receiving concussions from crash landings ect - example https://youtu.be/u_rELqpUafY?t=615 At this moment shouldn't the pilot have fallen out or got severely hurt by the impact? - Ability to hail other ships and put broadcasts 'on screen' so the whole crew can see and interact, as apposed to the current planned system which just works through the mobiglass. - Also ship cameras that can be broadcast through screens on board ships, kind of like the original star trek bridge. It would mean that someone in the lower decks could turn on a screen and see out the front if he wanted to see what was going on. If you can think of any other little features please post them in the comments :)</TEXT>

At no point can I get in to a LAAT, pick up my friends and take flag D like a bunch or republic commandos. I can't get in and out of ships or get into/fly the capital ships. It just feels like a shitty money grab with very simple and quickly boring gameplay. I hate it to the bone not just for the P2W stuff.</TEXT>

Also, I just remembered this game called Rouge System that is a full button functionality space sim https://youtu.be/nkEBKZN9Uys I dont think they need to go full flight sim for SC but having a multistep shutdown and startup process (more advanced than the current system) would really add to immersion imo</TEXT>

Luckily, the brilliant 'Zibu' 737 mod was patched a few days ago to work in VR. It is so awesome and rewarding (more than any other VR title) to learn the start up sequence in this plane. I have a few other non aircraft mods (like autogate, an atc mod, better push back etc) but most aircraft mods dont really seem to support the touch controllers. I really want to fly the A320 in vr, does the one by JarDesign work? Anyone who owns it able to tell me if it works with vr controllers? Any other VR mod reccommendations?</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Dice, please (pretty please) extend the round start up time (the time before you can move before the round begins) for the somme map when operations is released. This will greatly add the to the tension and atmosphere before going over the top. Additionally, during this time have a heavy bombardment on the german lines that ends a few seconds before the whistles blow. Please Dice! This kind of immersion is all iv ever wanted from a ww1 game!</TEXT>

    <TITLE>The Somme map feedback</TITLE>
    <DATE>2018-01-21 19:08:13</DATE>
    <TEXT>First of all, thank you DICE for an excellent couple of previous DLC maps. I defiantly feel that this one needs some work to be interesting and 'worthy' of being called 'The Somme'. - I really like the way there's that field from British Spawn toward the first flag, however, it is not big enough and there is no sense of 'going over the top' from the British trench at the start of a round. It would be a missed opportunity not to make a big thing out of 'going over the top' for this map in particular. - I understand you don't want to make German trenches too powerful, but I feel like a solid line (rather than only a bit of a trench) from A all the way to the border on the other side would be more thrilling to attack. - Secondly, people are arguing there's not enough cover. I see their point but just a few craters should fix this. Don't ruin the nice aesthetic. - Extend the size of the field from the British spawn to the first base, as a German by the time i'v spawned the Brits are already there. The opening area of the Somme is the most important part historically and thematically and so should be the largest in the map IMO Keep it up - but please make this map in particular a more authentic ww1 experience</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Maybe i'm in the minority but I always felt the 'less is more' philosophy is kinda bs, it's partly what ruined battlefront for me (max player count in that game being 40). I want bigger maps and more players in the next battlefield (200+?), with modes for competitive play too (40 players or less). That's what I always loved about Battlefield, the scale. Just wish they would get bigger, the maps can scale to fit the players also.</TEXT>

    <DATE>2018-01-22 16:50:07</DATE>
    <TEXT>Here's my idea Youtube devs: Viewers can create highlight clips from any video (by setting multiple start and end points) that they can upload to the community highlight section of a video. Then, if a person is in a rush and just wants to watch the best parts of a video they can browse the community highlight section and choose one. So, say I want to watch a game video and I want to skip the intro and the ending and just see the funny/entertaining bits, i can choose a highlight and just watch those bits. People could also rate each of the highlights people upload in a section inside the description area. Just and idea! I think it would be neat though</TEXT>

Imagine how epic the battle could be. Please consider adding this Devs, even if its not in the first release. I think it would make the map 10x better.</TEXT>

    <DATE>2018-02-18 13:37:03</DATE>
    <TEXT>I love to fantasize about what this game could become further down the line.. After initial release: - Multiplayer (Options for Coop and Copilot Coop, Also massive PVP battles with Copilot vs Copilot action). - New Coop vehicles (Apache - one pilot one gunner, B52 - one pilot one copilot, F-14 Tomcat - one pilot one copilot/bomber - AC130 - one pilot, one copilot, one/two gunners). Just adding this could make VTOL super popular and a VR platform seller. Crazy ideas in the way way way distant future and possibly with the help of a kickstarter or if the game starts selling really well: Either.... - Full on Battlefield style game in VR, Transport helis, infantry tanks, submarines (think iron wolf VR) ships, just a massive crazy vehicle centric battlefield game. Or/and.... - Miniature earth map (or full size) :O - A couple of civilian style airliners or prop planes with coop functionality - Player controlled ATC - etc etc</TEXT>

    <TEXT> gt; Removed the old map overview (you could access with tab)  gt; less movement features than the original total war games like walking and highly flexible unit sizes.  gt; No very open map (like the grassy flatland maps in other total war games) where team work and positioning matter (forming battle groups ect) and there wasn't many environmental obstacles. And now you can't play humans vs humans until you unlock tier 3 units. Very sad to see this from my favorite franchise</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Imagine once the game has finished, that new players could buy/download the game for a cheaper/free if it doesn't give them a ship. Instead it might spawn them on a city on Earth and they can meet with regular players (say in a bar) and go multicrew with them. This would give regular players a big pool of people to recruit for crew mates and also would let us multicrew with friends/family more easily. I don't know if these players would be allowed to earn money or not, maybe, and eventually buy a starter ship of their own. Just an idea</TEXT>

    <DATE>2018-12-03 08:50:37</DATE>
    <TEXT>- increase the scale (200 players) combined with bigger wide open maps. - Double down on imersion/authenticity, anything that breaks immersion (steam punk prosthetic arm crap) don't include - Go back to the old UI and vehicle spawn system (vehicles are on the map, you just get in, planes and helis take off from an airfield). - New features like proximity VOIP, building fortifications anywhere ect (take a leaf out of the game 'Squad's book) - Include plenty of weapon unlocks in the bf3 progression style - Let players pay for cosmetics and don't have a season pass, SO LONG AS you still deliver a lot of high quality content. Finally DONT RUSH IT, take 3 or 4 years minimum. Don't let EA bully you into botched releases. Post other ideas in the comments</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I understand and that was a well written long reply, but for me personally speaking the thing that always drew me to the Battlefield franchise was the spectacle of huge numbers of players battling it out across a wide open map. I don't want them to slow the game down particularly and make people's actions have consequences, I understand why that is appealing but to me that sounds like making the game more 'tacticle' which can be fun but isn't actually what I personally want from the Battlefield franchise. (Side note, I like tacticle shooters so I'm not against Battlefield taking this approach but I feel it's not relevant for this conversation about scale and imersion) As for the last point about an epic game not always being a large game, I agree but for me I want a large beautiful game, that is my definition of epic. I'll give you an example, imagine when they were designing BFV they decided to take a different approach. Imagine they had the Normandy landings, everyone started in the landers, you look around you see many even hundreds of other landers filled with real players. Meanwhile the Germans are spread along the coast preparing their defense. The map is so big that it takes a while for the ships to actually reach the coast, about 3 minutes after the round starts shells start falling around the landers from the German mortars. Finally the moment comes and 100 players simultaneously storm the beach on a wide front against a hundred defenders. This to me is epic. That sense of being part of something huge coupled with the graphics and fun gunplay and progression that Battlefield always provides will always be what makes me love Battlefield, and the series has so much potential if it innovates on scale. So, that being said I appreciate your long reply, I just have a different set of things that I look for in my immersive/epic Battlefield games.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Surley the big ships with lots of interior space to walk around in and RP should have longer jump times while the smaller ships have shorter.

    <TEXT>They made a decision to design the game in the way they did. They could have given us the old style game with the same amount of effort they put into the new games. It was a problem with the direction the game designers took, not a problem with it being too much work. Sure space to ground battles would be hard, but to create maps and battles that were more like the old ones (ones where you can just get into vehicles and fly off ect) would in itself not be much harder than making the games they made. I just think they need better game design direction.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>It's really good, just depends on a few things. Firstly, can your hardware deal with it. I've encountered no real problems. Secondly, how you play it.

Add me if you ever do get it and fancy playing https://steamcommunity.com/id/subject1889/</TEXT>

    <TEXT>We are in a much better position now than when I made this graph for three main reasons, First: The NHS doubled its respirator capacity by acquiring 4000 private healthcare respirators. Second: on top of this, the government has suggested that they will soon be able to acquire a total of 12000 respirators Three: This graph was made before the lockdown, at a time when school were all open. Now that they have taken these measures, we (may) be able to flatten the curve in the following three weeks to under the new max capacity. Overall, the main purpose of this graph was to wake people up to the danger, and to help prevent government inaction (back when this was made they were still talking about herd immunity), I am happy the UK government has changed its position. I would hate to be in Sweden right now where they are still not locked down, however. Saying this, there have been reports of overwhelmed hospitals in London, so watch the news in the UK over the next week we may still reach capacity in some hospitals, especially since we aren't providing adequate protection for docters (people are still often only wearing surgical masks, in Italy they have hospitals with full gas masks)</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Hello, I am making a very big wide open map for GMOD (a bit like flatgrass except ww1) and I need a bit of help figuring out how to reduce my normal compile time. I have done the usual stuff (Made everything I could a func\_detail) and am now trying to add func\_visclusters as an attempt to reduce compile time. My compiler always gets stuck on 0 on portal flow. I managed to get it down to 1441 portalclusters and 6674 numportals using visclusters but it still doesn't seem to be working. One time i was able to render the map when i first made it but that took 1 hour 20 minutes even though there' was nothing in the map but a skybox and a big empty plain. Any tips?</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Thank you, I actually know a lot of this now as that map was my second map ever. I'm making a new version with proper displacements. I always had problems getting stitch to work however in my new map I use many smaller displacements that are the same size and it looks better for it. I couldn't render in normal because VVIS took to long but putting in func_Visclusters seems to be fixing that. I'll post my new map later on if you want to review some pictures of it I really appreciate the help</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Sure see my other comment for a discord link but basically what we have so far is a map with support reserve and front lines for both the Germans and Brits, each line has various deep bunkers and funk holes. You can also dig an underground mine to blow up the enemy trench line and there's also a row of barbed wire that has to be destroyed with artillery bombardments. As far as progression and stuff we have classes and ranks that you can be promoted too if you show leadership or are courageous. For each class there are a few guns you can 'unlock' by doing RP jobs like ferrying supplies to and from the back line or picking up scrap and taking it to the salvage area. We also have artillery that is player fired behind the lines. You'll spend most of the time in your trenches unless you're sent on a night time trench raid or are in a big push. There's a day night cycle and working flares that light up no man's land. In the morning both teams 'stand to' incase of attack. Those are a few things that we have so far but it is a little clunky it's just me and two other guys really who are making it. The last playtest had 20 people in it and it was pretty fun it would be cool to have 64 players in the next one</TEXT>

    <TITLE>Long gamemode idea - 'Occupation'</TITLE>
    <DATE>2020-09-30 20:41:17</DATE>
    <TEXT>Just a little idea I had, hear me out: \--- Game mode: OCCUPATION (S1) STAGE 1: INVASION (1 hourish) It stars as invasion (Conventional vs Conventional with extra tickets for attackers). (S2) STAGE 2: INSURGENCY (2 hours) If the attacking team wins - the map stays the same except the defenders respawn and the defending team are now irregular (rather than conventional). Bluefor keep their fobs and don't respawn. Also, this version of insurgency is longer and more drawn out giving people reasons to set up logistics superfobs and patrol throughout the map. Cashes take longer to appear on people's maps and only show when Bluefor troops get fairly close to it. This version of insurgency would take a long time. Ideally civilians from PR could be added back for this but this is not necessary. Also, irregulars would not have access to mortar barrage commander ability in this mode to further encourage Bluefor super fob building. Examples: Map Al Basrah Defence team (S1: MEA) - gt; (S2: Insurgence), Attacking team (S1: UK) - gt; (S2: UK/no change) Map Yehorivka (S1: Russia) - gt; (S2: Militia). Attacking team (USA) - gt; no change Map Lashkar Valley Defending team (S1: MEA) - gt; (S2: Insurgence) Attacking team (S1:Russia/USA) - gt; (S2:Russia/USA) \--- I thought of this because I wanted a gamemode that would be long enough for superfobs to be really useful and a gamemode that would actually encourage their construction. I always enjoyed the building mechanics in Squad, but often the default game modes discourage Building super fobs due to time limitations and the necessity to keep moving toward new objectives. In this 'occupation' gamemode the construction and defence of a few strategic super fobs would actually contribute to teamplay and wouldn't be a waste of men/resources.  #8203; I'd appreciate any thoughts/feedback on this idea</TEXT>

    <TEXT>To what extent will btw be influenced by the mechanics of games like squad and post Scriptum. ? In particular, how do you intend to include logistics (whether that be trucks or something troops can carry) and will the creation of FOBS be a thing. I imagine being able to go out and build barbed wire in no man's land before an attack for example.</TEXT>
