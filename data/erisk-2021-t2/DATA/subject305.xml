    <TEXT>The way I see this going is that Allu is going to leave NiP. Pronax will then join and become the new IGL. f0rest will become AWPer. Xizt takes a support type role and GeT_RiGhT continues with being the Lurker. Friberg plays Entry, then hopefully with some new strats and shizz from pronax they will be able to prioritise Friberg to be a top tier entry fragger again.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Switch the AWP role to f0rest, give Xizt the support role and have pronax as the IGL, keep GeT_RiGhT as lurker and have Friberg play entry. With the signing of pronax I believe he could prioritise friberg and base some strats around him, and make him a top entry fragger again.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I want the lineup to consist of this, and it is also what I believe is going to happen. f0rest, GTR, Pronax, Friberg, Xizt So, f0rest transitions to becoming the main AWPer for the team and GTR continues with his lurking/rifler role. Pronax will now be the IGL and what I hope will happen will be that they then have better strats and they will be more focused on prioritizing friberg to get into sites and opening them up, Xizt will transition to a rifler/support role and will support friberg with the entry.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Question is: How isn't it awful? The RWS system is fucking shit. You could be playing perfectly, getting important kills to contribute to the round, however if you die and a teammate is placed in a clutch situation and fails miserably or is just shit and loses the round for you then you gain nothing in terms of statistics. It should instead be based on ADR, (Average Damage per Round) that way you will be rewarded for your individual skill rather than gaining nothing because your team is shit. The RWS just doesn't reward the players individual skill efficiently.</TEXT>

Especially with the songs that are purely instrumentals, my favourites being Ramparts and Murderers (of course :P ) but also Untitled #2/#4/#6/#7. There's times where I will just play many different compilations of Johns solos from the RHCP concerts because I can just feel all of the pure emotion just pouring out. I love it all, and no other musician/artist comes close to making me feel this way. So you're not alone mate.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Same here. I love all of his music. it just makes me feel so euphoric. Whenever I listen to his music I just zone out into a state of pure relaxation and let all my stress and worries wash away. His music is truly beautiful. Edit: Would also like to add that Josh Klinghoffers solo work with John and Bob Forrest is also incredible and adds another dimension to this beautiful music. Songs like [Omission](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ug4a8kApRpQ) and [Hurt](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hgPJXTIx3do) are great examples of this. Not to mention his work with RHCP is great as well.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Done my best, slashes indicate parts I'm not sure of or may not make sense. **Page 1** Beginning nowhere, a place that had been pulling me, yelling for me, chasing for me as well as us nothings playing John Frusciante could gather ever since we were untangled at some hotels in Europe where I was very very close to punching out some of the interviewers there as they were insisting that I was a rock star and not a nothing. Had fun with nothingness for the next year playing on stage and looking at my bass players eyes, and in a moment of clarity (clarity which had been developing ever since I was mistaking myself for a grain of sand) finally jumped in a pool (mid-tour), swam in circles, then the pipes which led to the ocean and swam all the way back to Los Angeles. **Page 2** (some words in the beginning may be wrong because it seems they are covered by the paper.) Then one month, laying on a couch unable to listen to music, read books, draw or even look at pictures. Activities which we /never did normally?/ for a reason not known to anyone around him, he said were too painful. He also said he quit playing guitar. He later admitted to often laying on the couch. Once he finally /???/ waiting for someone to /???/ he began listening to his favourite music. (Bowie, Captain Beefheart and a few others.) He became so serious about painting and drawing that he was now immersed in that and spent about one year doing that, literally 2 hours a day, falling asleep every 3 days or so with his face on freshly painted canvas and waking up a few hours later and went back to it. He spent some of his time /ends abruptly./ **Page 3** John Frusciante quit the Red Hots in Japan, a place he dislikes, and has gone completely insane as happened on their trip there 2 years before. This had me feeling no more insane than he had been for the last year on the road, he left the band with no real reason, but they and he live in some very unreal places. As far as he was concerned he was just doing what he decided to do a year ago at which time there really wouldn't have been any clear verbal reason for which reason he felt that even if he quit the band would not grant him this. His lack of any reason other than a bad feeling about how the /???/ would affect would have been shown to be compared to how well the band communication and magic was going and how they simply would not have let him quit the band. By the time he quit the solidarity of the band had been long ago fucked up when he returned from Japan.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>In my opinion this is probably one of the greatest things I've ever heard from John. When the song climaxes at 5:22 and 8:50 it's just one of the most spine-chilling things I've ever listened to. John is for me one of the only guitarists/artists that can give me a feeling like this, with the possible exception of Brian May. Pretty amazing. Not to mention Flea and Chad killed it as well.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>There are so many moments I could list and I would probably end up going on forever but here are some that really stick out to me:  #8226; Soul to Squeeze solo, Chorzow.  #8226; Wet Sand solo, Live at Pinkpop.  #8226; Final Jam at Chorzow. 13 minutes of euphoria.  #8226; Here, Air. The Empyrean. In my opinion an often overlooked song. Nice guitar playing and beautiful vocals.  #8226; Slane Castle, Parallel Universe solo. Insane.  #8226; ATP 2005 performance. Can't choose anything specific from this. It's just brilliant throughout. Like one of the previous comments Carvel is just incredible with so much energy.  #8226; So Much I, Chorzow. I don't know what it is about this solo but It gives me goosebumps every time.  #8226; Alcatraz Milano, Dani California outro and jam. Easily the greatest version of Dani California live in my opinion. Love John's solo and Flea's part. I could probably add many more.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>John Frusciante. The former guitarist for the Red Hot Chili Peppers between 1988-1992 and 1998-2009. The man is a genius. I love his music as there is just so much emotion in everything he writes and plays and its evident when you watch him live at [RHCP concerts](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T5V9eaiKuxo amp;feature=youtu.be amp;t=9m48s) or during one of his [solo shows](https://youtu.be/dc_DsvGTI2o?t=10m14s). If you follow [this link](https://www.reddit.com/r/jfdisc/comments/6tici2/introduction_to_john_frusciante_for_rparamore/) I have written up a large post that could hopefully introduce people to his music. Take a read if you'd like. It's basically his entire discography. Zac and Joseph (HalfNoise drummer) also listen to him.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Very hard to choose from all of the songs. So I'm gonna list a few that I think are his best. All of them are live except "Turn it Again". I tend to like these more because there is always a different variation of the solo. [Soul To Squeeze, Live in Chorz #243;w, Poland 2007.](https://youtu.be/-dq9qNXgTyY?t=2m40s) [Dani California, Abbey Road 2006](https://youtu.be/8F0WTD4Lvbo?t=3m24s) and of course [Alcatraz.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GaZZcGvk4bg amp;feature=youtu.be amp;t=4m11s) [Parallel Universe, Slane Castle 2003.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3_CSDD0lFc amp;feature=youtu.be amp;t=4m41s) [Don't Forget Me, Fuji Rock 2006.](https://youtu.be/PrMmr49e7xw?t=3m22s) [I Could Have Lied, Saturn 2002.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7FZDgyH6yCU amp;feature=youtu.be amp;t=1m54s) [YEAHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH, Pinkpop 2006](https://youtu.be/Ov56C8xine8?t=5m4s) [Chorzow Jam, 2007](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T5V9eaiKuxo) - The whole things just too fucking good. [Turn It Again, Stadium Arcadium](https://youtu.be/gbAWM-SR67E?t=4m15s) I could probably list many more.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>In the past few hours I've been trading a lot and mass bidding/buying players. During that time I have received two 20 min temporary trading bans. What happens if I continue trading like this, can I possibly get a perma ban?</TEXT>

    <TEXT>So I'm tempted to purchase the game for PC. However, how long do you think the game will last before people stop playing it? I don't want to purchase the game and then after a month or so of playing it ends up like COD 4: Remastered which is dead despite all the hype and ruined by hackers. In the WW2 beta there were already hackers playing the game so how long until they ruin the game for everyone? (I will be playing on EU servers).</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Yep, thats the one. Sorta sounds like a slightly slowed down version of the solo in Johns song. I love it. :) Also I'm an idiot and spent ages trying to find the song in my Spotify playlist and turns out I hadn't added the deluxe editions of any of the albums after all this time. No wonder I couldn't find it.

    <TEXT>John Frusciante's (ex RHCP guitarist) wife Nicole Turley filed for divorce in 2015 and was seeking for $75k + $2600 (for apparent gifts and expenses for her brother. lmao.) a month as part of the divorce settlement. She was already being paid $20k a month and claimed she needed a higher payment to maintain her quality of living. The judged ruled in favour of Turley and Frusciante was ordered to pay $53k a month and pay for her legal expenses which were $71k. Why should he pay to maintain her quality of life when she chose to leave him? Thats $53,000 **A MONTH** to maintain her quality of living as she was "used to a certain lifestyle". Disgusting.

    <TEXT>Turns out the song was created by John for use in Zac Posen's fashion show. I would assume that Zac found out about John through Milla Jovovich who was in a relationship with John in 2000 and has supported Zac earlier in his career. In an interview Zac has said in reply to his favorite musicians, [Scarlatti and John Frusciante](http://www.elle.com/fashion/a9490/showtime-261447/) and also said in response to his first show ["My first show at NYFW was in: February 2002 with original music composed with John Frusciante."](http://www.instyle.com/awards-events/fashion-week/new-york-fashion-week/designer-zac-posen-firsts-career)</TEXT>

    <TEXT>His magnum opus. An incredible album. His other albums like Curtains, The Will to Death and Shadows Collide with People are equally as good. Even some of his earlier work like Niandra Lades which although isn't as accessible as his newer work it is also an amazing album full of raw emotion.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Same thing happened with my grandmother. One day around January 2015 her skin went completely yellow. A while later in Hospital she was told she had pancreatic cancer and a Pancreaticoduodenectomy (or Whipple procedure) would need to be performed. Only a few months later and the cancer had metastasised to the liver. She died the following January. The entire time she had cancer she had to be on many various different types of tablets such as Creon which is used to treat malabsorption. Her weight rapidly dropped and in the end she was literally just skin and bone. A skeleton. Worst thing I've ever seen.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>https://www.emusician.com/gear/john-frusciantes-creative-explosion **- 00 Ghost27.**  #8220;I'd been listening to an experimental electronic album at my house. I can't remember what it was, but two seconds of it stirred my mind. It sounded like a Mellotron choir through a really distorted, screaming, feedbacky synth. I went into the studio the next day to try to re-create what I thought I had heard. I had a Mellotron choir sound on an E-mu module, and I put it through the Doepfer. You take an audio signal and use it to control a filter and dial knobs in a way that creates screaming feedback. It was one of those moments when music descends upon you. #8221;</TEXT>

    <TEXT>John is for me one of the greatest guitarists and artists of all time. I love both his solo work and albums he produced with the Red Hot Chili Peppers. His cover of Song to the Siren is actually how I found out about Tim Buckley and now I am a big fan of Tim's music. If you are a fan of frusciante you should come check out /r/John_Frusciante/. It's quite active. Also his album The Empyrean which contains his cover of Song to the Siren as just been [reissued on vinyl earlier this week.](https://www.johnfrusciante.com/)</TEXT>

    <TEXT>All around you is to feel and watch you, They make patterns to peel the sound And I find it a pain that goes along With being in chaos's order, I've a field now to realize in, Watch the main jump, It has fears of you being there rising up, Like who you're introduced to saying goodbye. All again and you're always free now, I didn't fake this so you could fade away I've been careful to take what I've spent, I remember every end. I'm pretending to face something, I've been looking straight in it's eye, Moments have you to play around with, 'Cause inside actions there's no time, I'll evade you to create a reason, I hear you inside a space, An instant is forever now, A future fluctuates. Glimpse your motion, Sitting down, It's like framing a pair Or saving sounds. I defy you to realize it, How a shattering creates a song, I've been used to help the body Of work that will never be A lapse of the most confused kind, Has reserved feelings jumping around, The first type plays around the souls, They have fun with everyone you know. A knot only found, Never made, Everyday we reload feelings, When we play.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Tim Buckley is amazing. [Phantasmagoria in Two](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bsO756lqfVM) and [Morning Glory](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MgNxopvE3ro) are two of my favourite songs of his. [Goodbye and Hello](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qGgdPD4Idps amp;list=PLRQKT-Cu2_2RFxRavHg1s6Yg2xGhMCTEi) as a whole is a great album. [Wings](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w3OFRKKf6Pk amp;list=PL5186F9F7D2C7D65D) is a pretty good album too. He had an incredible voice.</TEXT>

    <TITLE>1 rear usb is not working.</TITLE>

    <TEXT>Computer Type: Custom build GPU: NONE CPU: Ryzen 3 3200g Motherboard: MSI B550 Gaming Edge WIFI RAM: DDR4 32GB Ballistix 3200mhz PSU: EVGA GQ 850 Case: Corsair 540 Operating System  amp; Version: Windows 10 10.0.19041 Build 19041 GPU Drivers: Adrenalin 2020 Edition 20.9.2 Chipset Drivers: 2.07.21.306 I purchased a MSI B550 Gaming Edge WIFI a few days ago and one of my rear usb ports is not working [(Specifically this one.)](https://i.imgur.com/XMy1YB4.png) but does power my Blue Yeti microphone as the light turns on. However it does not seem to acknowledge it at all and I can't use it. I have installed the newest BIOS, chipset drivers, cleared CMOS and tried the port by itself and it still doesn't work. Is there anything else I can try? Also, will a broken port potentially damage my motherboard in the future if I were not to return it? I could live without it if it isn't a problem.</TEXT>
