    <TITLE>My favorite person won't speak to me....</TITLE>
    <DATE>2020-02-25 11:54:33</DATE>
    <TEXT>I'm really struggling right now. A couple of weeks ago, my FP told me that she needed a break from me. Ouch! Being my bpd self, I immediately went into the frantic efforts to avoid abandonment. I mean, she told me it's not forever, but I struggle to believe that and am quite convinced that she hates me and will never speak to me again. I try not to message her and let her have her space, but that's so hard for me to do. I feel like such an idiot for loving a person so much who seems to only tolerate my existence. I'm to the point of wishing that we had never become friends at all, because it would have saved me this heartache. Anyone have advice on giving your FP space so you don't end up pushing them away for good?</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I have BPD and really struggle with the fear of abandonment....that being said, I seem to really struggle when friends try to "set boundaries" by doing things like not talking to me. I can't understand how you could hurt someone like that when you know what things they struggle with; I never could. I'm left feeling abandoned, forgotten, unimportant, and unloved. A big part of me wants to lash out at the person for cutting me off like they did, but I know deep down that doing so will just push them further away from me, and I certainly cannot handle that. I just don't know what to do, because this situation makes me even more depressed than usual and all I want to do is fix what seems to be broken. Anyone go through this? I'm really wondering how to navigate this period of silence without going crazy....</TEXT>

    <DATE>2020-03-03 11:36:25</DATE>
    <TEXT>Hey all, so my FP hasn't spoken to me but once in the past 3 weeks, because she said she needed a break. This is KILLING me!!! I've tried checking in on her a couple of times, because I know she has a ton going on and I get worried, but to no avail :( I feel like our friendship is a stake if we don't get things figured out and I don't want to lose her. The thing is that we can't figure things out with her not speaking to me. Part of me is tempted to just show up (she lives out of state) and kinda force her hand in speaking to me so we can actually hash this out. Is this the worst idea ever?? Will she hate me if I do that??</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I feel you, except I am totally insane when it comes to my FP and she knows it. I can rarely contain my crazy. It's gotten so bad that she recently had to take a break from me where we didn't speak at all; it nearly KILLED me. We've come to a place now where she has agreed to check in with me a certain number of times a week, but we don't talk otherwise. It's still tough for me, because if it was up to me we would talk every second of every day. I'm trying really hard though, because I know if I don't tone things down that I'll just push her away from me. I wish I had some advice for you, but I'm in almost the exact same boat. The only difference is that my FP knows that she's in that role in my life; that doesn't make things easier though. I applaud you for being able to control yourself and not freak your FP out, especially since you aren't actually close; that's hella difficult.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Been struggling with my relationship with my fp. She asked for a break and it was absolutely hell for me to wait to hear from her for so long. We are working things out and have agreed to a communication schedule to keep her from being overwhelmed by me and me from freaking out that she'll leave. I must admit that I'm actually kind of proud of myself for expressing what I needed in order to feel safe and loved so that we could work something like this out. It's not exactly ideal, but better than no communication at all.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I'm the same way! Doesn't help that my FP is a sickly person and I'm constantly worried about losing her anyway. I hate being so irrational! The tricky thing for me is that I knwo I'm being completely irrational, but can't seem to snap myself back into reality until I hear from her and KNOW for sure that she is ok. This can go on for days as we don't get to talk as much I'd like and I get so scared. I feel so dumb when she finally gets back to me and tells me that there's nothing wrong, she was just busy; I always imagine the worst though.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I reached out to an old friend after years of not seeing each other or talking. Nothing happened to our friendship, just drifted apart I suppose. We went out to lunch to catch up and it was literally the worst. I thought it would be good and I could share everything I've been dealing with for years that this friend has missed. Thing is, we just talked about her and she didn't ask how I was doing or anything. This was really upsetting to me as my depression and BPD already have a significant impact on my relationships and I really don't have friends these days. I guess I was hoping things would be like they used to be, but it wasn't even close. Now I'm super down and wishing I just never tried with anyone ever because I feel like no one cares about me or wants me around. Even though I know these thoughts are largely irrational, I can't help but find slivers of truth. Everyone says that adult friendships are tough, but it's so much worse with these issues running my mind.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>In my experience, it's literally the worst. Not to discourage you, but just being honest. I struggle a ton with suicidal ideations and abandonment issues and I just can't seem to shake either. I have been in the psych ward 9 times now and did 5.5 months of residential treatment, but feel like I've actually just gotten worse over the years. They say DBT really helps though and I'm working on getting in with a DBT therapist. We shall see. I hope you have a smoother road to recovery than I have.</TEXT>

It's actually kind of frustrating to me that she doesn't believe that I have BPD. How can she understand and properly work with me if she doesn't accept this diagnosis? Meanwhile, I am trying to get in with a DBT therapist because that's basically all that's left for me to try. Hopefully I'll find one that agrees with my diagnosis so that I can actually get the help I need.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Just to preface I'm a 28 and have BPD, MDD, and GAD. I feel as though I stopped growing emotionally many years ago and am thus left unable to navigate this world on an emotional level. Maybe it's just the way with the BPD, but I'm not sure. Anyone else feel like they're stuck on an emotional level way below their actual age? I'm frustrated because this has left me with so much work to do to get myself to a better, more functional, place.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Hey there, I know how you feel thinking it won't get better. I can't say it will, but what I can do is encourage you to keep on trying. Even if trying your best doesn't mean working 40 hours, you're still doing YOUR best; and that's what matters. As for the meds issue, would it be cheaper to see your GP? Maybe they would keep you on your meds until you can get back in with your psychiatrist? I'm proud of you for ending a toxic relationship, even though it's probably been hell on you; it'll be better for you in the end. Keep your head up and always fight for yourself and your health! You got this, even when it feels like you don't.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>If you know all of this about yourself earlier on than getting an actual diagnosis, it just gives you even more time to work on things. I mean, if they say that they don't diagnose at your age because our personalities are still developing, doesn't that mean you have time still to tweak bits of yours that are causing you trouble? I didn't realize what I was dealing with and ask a doctor about it until I was 23 and by then I was already pretty dead set in most of my ways. 5 years in, I still really struggle to control my symptoms and most days feel as though I can't do it; but I'm still holding out hope! I'm looking to start DBT therapy soon (it's basically all that's left for me to try) as it was specifically designed for BPD. I've heard that some people who go through DBT experience a remission of sorts of their symptoms and feel so much better. Don't get too wrapped up in a diagnosis, as a diagnosis doesn't define you. I would talk to a therapist about maybe incorporating some DBT work into your therapy routine (assuming you already attend therapy, that is.) I wish you the best of luck in fighting this demon, you can do it!</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Hey there. I would say that for me, personally, this is common. I've lost most of my friends due to some of my BPD related behaviors. I tend to split on people and say things that I later regret. Unfortunately, most people don't know hot to handle this and opt to just leave. Luckily, my current FP is a therapist and she understands what is happening when I split on her and she knows how to deal with me. I'm not sure what to tell you about how to handle this besides to learn to be comfortable with being alone. But that's shit advice, right? Lol Much easier said than done. I know that being on here has certainly given me a sense of belonging because people actually understand me and they have similar experiences, so I feel less alone.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>One thing I would say about being in the hospital is to remember that their goal is to get you stable enough to go back out into the "real" world. It's not meant to be a long term solution. Many of the times I've gone (been in inpatient in the psych ward 9 times) it was just a med adjustment and a place that I felt safe from myself until my intense suicidal thoughts had lessened. I think it's great that you're willing to still give life a chance and if going to the hospital is what helps you keep that mindset, then by all means, go. None of the hospitals I have been to have allowed smoking. Days are mostly spent going to groups, watching TV, reading, playing games, coloring, eating, and sleeping. One of the things that is always helpful for me is that you can be totally real because the other patients understand what you're dealing with and you don't feel alone in what you're going through. I wish you the best of luck and am proud of you for reaching out and wanting to keep trying!</TEXT>

I hate that my mind works the way it does and that I think of these things. I hope you remain in a place in your mind that you don't actually want to act on your plan.

    <TEXT>I feel it again, the urge to let it out. I want to feel the pain, make my skin shout.  #8203; I had a plan; over them up and I'd be done. But I failed quickly; the urges won.  #8203; I dare not destroy the art that covers what I did in the past. But I've got plenty of skin for this obsession to last.  #8203; I found a new place and let myself bleed. If only the scars could show my hurt, could be words for all to read.  #8203; But they don't get why, the don't understand; how could this have been done by my own hand?  #8203; It was easy you see, to grab draw the lines that I'd always see. And now it won't leave, like it's just another part of me.  #8203; It is a battle I feel I will never win; I will just keep failing again and again.  #8203; What's so wrong with it, I ask you all. Why can't I answer that siren call.  #8203; They say it's not a healthy way to cope. But to me, it feels something like hope.  #8203; As I drag the blade again and again, I am still alive; not giving in to the darker desires of my mind. It's all that keeps me from doing myself in and leaving this world behind.  #8203; So how does one function without some sort of vice? It used to be different, I used to think twice.  #8203; Now it's become the norm, the same old habit. These days in my blood and fear I sit.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I never learned how to properly study because I never needed to do so. I never even developed good study habits while I was in college. I don't think that, for me, this was the detrimental part of being labeled as gifted.What hurt me the most were the expectations of me. I was always quick to learn and good at my work, so my parents were just used it. Because of this, doing well on my school work was considered the norm and I never received any praise or affirmation that I was doing a good job. I personally think this led me to underachieve and rarely show my true potential because no one seemed to care as long as I kept getting good grades. I never really put my all into anything, because I didn't have to. As a result, I ended up in getting a degree in a field that I'm not actually super passionate about; I simply chose it because it came easily to me.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I have a similar story, so I can empathize with where you're coming from and what you did. I think the toughest thing about having lived, for me, is seeing the fear and pain in the eyes of my loved ones when I'm getting bad again. I am sure I traumatized my mother, who found me unresponsive, and I hate myself for that. My family has been super supportive through all of my mental health struggles, but at times I wish they weren't. I suppose that in my mind the lack of support would make it easier to off myself, like I often feel like doing. I am glad to hear that you are going to the psychiatrist soon! My psychiatrist is amazing and gives me one more person that is trying to help me and keep me safe. I hope you have a similar, positive experience. My hope for you is that you find a place in your mind that is calm and loving toward yourself so that you may find peace and purpose in staying alive.</TEXT>

    <DATE>2020-05-10 10:21:37</DATE>
    <TEXT>I am really struggling lately with the pictures in my head. I often find myself creating images in my mind of what my suicide might look like. The images are often gruesome and disturbing, even though my plan isn't gruesome at all. These pictures leave me having suicidal ideations even worse than what I normally do when my mind just wanders to the thoughts, rather than what it might look like. I never experienced this until earlier this year and it scared me enough to take myself to the hospital when it first started. I was free from these images for a few months, but they have recently begun to reappear in my mind. I hate this and wish I knew of a way to stop it. My mind is a scary place.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>My former therapist used to ask me to focus on my purpose in this world as a means of giving myself reason to keep on living. I have come to believe that my purpose is to serve others and help them find happiness, even if it's fleeting. I love helping people and making people smile; it makes me truly happy and helps me feel needed in the world. Perhaps you have a similar purpose and you staying alive might just lead to an opportunity where you can change the life of another.

    <TEXT>I am really struggling with missing my FP and knowing that she doesn't love me as much as I love her. I realize that my love is kind of an obsession and isn't actually healthy, but I just cannot seem to change my thinking when it comes to my FP. I want to talk to her all the time and she simply doesn't have the time or energy for that. I've gotten better about not splitting on her when I feel ignored, because I know it is just my perception of the situation and not the reality. Unfortunately, I always think she is going to leave me and constantly feel the need to make sure she isn't. She has told me time and again that she won't leave and even shown it to me in my darkest hours, but I still struggle to trust this. I just want to have a "normal" friendship and not be so obsessed, but I don't seem to know how.</TEXT>

On days that I feel better, I find myself wishing that I didn't. The lows are where I have lived for so long that I am more comfortable feeling shitty than feeling okay. Sometimes I wonder if my illnesses are just a figment of my imagination that I have allowed to become my reality.

    <TEXT>The length of therapy is largely dependent on you. I have been in therapy for about 5 years now and am told, by more than one therapist, that I'll likely need to keep it up for the rest of my life. I go at least every other week, sometimes weekly (or even more if needed). I also see my psychiatrist monthly to check in on my meds; she makes me come earlier if I'm doing poorly. I think talking about your past issues can be beneficial, as they may be affecting you in ways you don't even realize. I say stick it out until you feel like you truly don't need to go any longer.

    <TEXT>I struggle with BPD, MDD, and anxiety, it is often very hard for me to imagine myself in the future, because I am almost always feeling suicidal. Lately, I have begun making plans for a trip that is not scheduled to happen for more than 2 years from now. This is huge for me! This means I have something to look forward to and I am actually planning to still be alive in 2 years. I am so happy about this!</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Hey there! I would say start with your PCP, they can prescribe you meds if they don't think you need to see a psychiatrist. If they do think you need one, they can refer you. I would also suggest getting in with a good therapist. Remember that some therapists might not be a good fit for you, so you may have to try out a few before you find one that you feel truly comfortable seeing. I encourage you to keep looking until you find the right one, and not try to stick it out with someone who isn't helpful for you. Proud of you for looking for help!</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I have this struggle, but on the flip side, seeing as I'm the one with BPD. Sometimes, I jsut want my FP to truly understand how terrible I feel and how scared I am of my own mind. In those moments, I'm just needing someone to talk to. I'm sure it's scary for her and I've tried to tone it down, but I still sometimes find myself texting her when I'm feeling suicidal. People tend to label that as emotionally abusive or as me testing her, but I'm not doing either intentionally. Do set some boundaries, as that will be best for both of you. Just be prepared for her to freak out when you do so, as she might feel like you're going to abandon her.</TEXT>

I find distraction to be good for me, even if it takes quite some time to shake the urge off. I spend so much time in my head wanting to hurt myself, but I know it isn't a good idea. Your life is not worthless, it is precious! Maybe opening up to someone about what's going on and why you feel the need to do it could be helpful. Have you considered therapy?</TEXT>

It doesn't have to be that something that others would consider huge happened to you. It simply matters how it felt to you.

Make sure to wash them with unscented soap 3 times a day, pat dry, and lotion, with a thin layer of unscented lotion, after. The washing is important to prevent infection, so be sure to stay on top of it. Do not pick when they start to scab! They;ll get really itchy, but don't scratch; kind of slap at them lightly and the itch should go away.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>When I split, I am fully aware of what I'm doing, just don't feel like I can stop myself once it has started. Basically, my FP and I came to the agreement that we will talk at least 3x per week, on MWF. She didn't speak to me on Monday then one Tuesday she came back with the excuse that she was busy. I freaking hate when she does this to me. Telling me she was busy is BS. She made a conscious decision to ignore me, even though it was a day that we're supposed to make time for one another. I really want to just lay into her and tell her how shitty it was of her and how much it pissed me off and upset me. On one hand, I'm proud of myself for not doing do, because that means I'm making progress. But on the other, I just want to blow up and make her realize that she's treating me poorly. Then again, I know I would feel terrible for doing so. I just want her to understand how it makes me feel when she does this to me and doesn't stand by her word.</TEXT>

Knowing why I do what I do has allowed me to better work on my stuff. My biggest things seem to be the fear of abandonment, suicidal tendencies, self-harm, and splitting. Self-harm is my only addiction, though I go long periods without hurting myself. I tend to go on binges of things that are dangerous/unhealthy for me, but am always able to stop after a bit.</TEXT>

Or at least that they help as much as they're going to, but that's not much. I have tried so many medications that they even tried TMS and ECT with me. The ECT didn't do anything, but the TMS helped for a short period of time. Meds aren't always the answer though they may help sometimes. I'm currently waiting for this whole pandemic thing to end so that I can get into DBT as it's the last thing I haven't tried. Maybe you should ask about having that genetic testing done to find out what class of meds will work best for you.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I feel suicidal all the time. I know that sounds dramatic, but it's pretty true. Whenever I have time to think, I think about killing myself. I ranges from thinking about methods to actually seeing images of my mind of me dead of various causes. I have a plan in place, but don't currently plan on carrying it out anytime soon. It's like something that I keep in my pocket for when I need it. I have gotten pretty good at knowing when my ideations are becoming too serious and taking myself to the hospital, but I'm certain that one day I just won't have it in me to do that. I don't want to hurt my family, but also feel as though I am a burden to them just being alive.

    <TEXT>I have a cat as my emotional support animal, she helps me to feel less alone since I live by myself. It always makes me happy when she sits with me and purrs, I focus on that rather than the terrible things in my brain. I would totally get a dog if I had room for one, I think they are great for helping keep you busy and giving you something that you have to do everyday like feeding them and taking them out and playing with them. I think pets can definitely help you feel less alone in this world! I say get a dog!</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I went to my PCP a few times to get started on meds for my severe depression. It was a struggle, but after a few months I finally told her that I thought i may have BPD, so she referred me to a psychiatrist. I also have bad social anxiety, so bringing it up the first time was hard for me. I wrote out everything I wanted to tell her first, so I could make sure I wasn't leaving things out then basically just recited what I'd written. My psychiatrist today is so easy to talk to, so I feel comfortable telling her everything that's going on in my head.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I emailed my therapist when I switched, because I couldn't bring myself to talk to her about it. I think it's important to remember that a good therapist wants what's best for you and will support you in whatever that may be. Therapists realize that they won't be a good match for everyone, so don't worry about hurting their feelings. Just be honest about how you're feeling and let them know that you're making a move that you feel will be best for your mental health.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I would say that all you can really do is be there and be as supportive as possible. I was scared to death when I first went to my GP about my depression and later a psychiatrist for BPD. What helped me be honest about my symptoms was writing things out before hand. Perhaps encourage her to write out her feelings and everything she is dealing with and offer to read it before she goes; process with her. Above all, it is important to let her know that you are there for her no matter how the appointment goes; don't let her feel alone.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I think about killing myself near constantly, like every day. I see so many people on here saying that they want to die because their lives are so miserable or because they feel like they are not good enough as a person. That honestly breaks my heart for them. The thing is though, I don't understand that. I live a good life; I have jobs that I love, a great family, and even though I have severe depression, I am a very happy person. But I want to die. I want to go through with what I have been planning for so long. It makes me feel terrible that I want to do this, given that I have no real "reason" to feel the way I do. I mean, yes, I have a few mental illnesses, but that shouldn't make me want to die or I should be able to control them well enough that they don't get to that point. My therapist has even said that she fears I am one that she will lose to suicide. At this point, killing myself feels inevitable, even if my ideations aren't always active. I just hate that I feel like this and would be willing to ruin other people's (my family) lives.</TEXT>

I know she doesn't understand just how much I love her and can't love me in the same way, but that doesn't make it hurt any less when I feel like she has abandoned me. She does a good job with setting boundaries and I'm trying to learn to toe the line, but it's so hard for me. I wish I didn't let another person affect me in such a way, but I can't seem to help it. I hate myself when I feel like I'm constantly pestering her, and even more when I split. It just feels like life would be so much easier if we had never met and then she would be free of me.</TEXT>

I am on an anti-depressant, anti-psychotic, mood stabilizer, and a stimulant (it helps with my lethargy and honestly is the only one I feel helps me be in a better mood.) This isn't necessarily common, especially the stimulant being used for this purpose. I don't really feel like the meds help me all that much, as I still experience all of the typical symptoms of BPD and bad SI. My psychiatrist says she thinks the meds are doing as much as they possibly can for me. I have been on so many different meds, and this seems to be as good as it gets.</TEXT>

    <DATE>2020-06-20 04:56:19</DATE>
    <TEXT>I have a really tumultuous relationship with my FP and it has once again gotten to the point that she is refusing to talk to me. It's a long story, but she straight up called me manipulative, a liar, and toxic; all of which I'm really hurt by. I even showed all of the screenshots to my therapist and she agrees that my FP was the one doing the overreacting on this one. I wasn't being manipulative or lying to anyone about anything. I know I can be manipulative, but one thing I certainly am not is a liar. All I want to do is talk things through and figure out a better way forward in our friendship, but I'm always shut down and told that we need to take some time apart first; then the conversation never happens. I'm not even really mad, I'm just hurt. I just want things to work out and it's like she couldn't care any less about our friendship or even me for that matter. So much of me wants to be able to call it quits and walk away; but I feel like it would completely destroy me to do so. I don't know why I even feel like this since our relationship is so painful for me, too. Is it even possible to be the one that leaves in this situation? I feel like I'm too invested and obsessed to walk away.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Hey there. I don't think it's possible to go without having your loved ones affected. Our lives are intertwined with those of others in ways that we may not even imagine. For me, it's the thought of hurting my family that has kept me alive. Sometimes I try to tell myself that my death would be easier on them than seeing me live in pain all the time, but I'm always told that that thought is very wrong. They don't want to see you in pain, but being able to see you alive is infinitely better than never seeing you again. I try to put myself in their shoes and think about how I would react if my sister or someone killed themselves, and I know it would ruin me. I'm really sorry your life is rough right now. I'm not going to feed you any lines about it getting better, because I'm not sure it does. What I will say is that there are moments, even the tiniest ones, that make living worth it. Look for those little moments and hold on for just another second if that's all you can manage, then another after that, and another after that until time has gone by without your noticing. Stay alive, you can do this.</TEXT>

    <TITLE>Therapy with my FP?</TITLE>
    <DATE>2020-06-20 08:11:09</DATE>
    <TEXT>I am really struggling to maintain my friendship with my FP. Currently, she will not speak to me, and it is literally making me physically ill to think about everything being my fault. I think it might be beneficial for both of us to have a therapy session together so we can talk things out and have my therapist there to deescalate if needed. Anyone tried this before? Was it helpful or is this a terrible idea? I might also mention that my FP is a therapist. I feel like when she looks at me, she sees only my BPD and blames me for everything wrong in our friendship; taking into account nothing that she does that triggers me. Kinda feels like she only sees my reactions to things and just ignores the things that I am reacting to. I try to help her understand me and how my disorder affects my actions, but she just acts like she knows it all from her education on BPD.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Same. My FP is not a romantic partner, just a friend; but man, to me it feels like she hung the moon. I try to do so much to be a great friend, and it's just not reciprocated. I know that if we were both to be obsessed like I am, it would be awful; but I just want a little bit of effort on her part. It's like our friendship is totally one sided with me putting in all of the effort to keep it afloat. Then when I decide to ask for more from her, I'm being totally unreasonable and not respecting her boundaries. I just want to feel loved and important.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I lived in Honduras for about 5.5 months. I didn't go to learn or improve my Spanish; I was teaching English at a bilingual school. I wasn't allowed to speak Spanish with my students, but definitely got practice out in the community. My conversational skills improved just by listening to others and learning to use the local terms rather than the more formal ones I had learned in school. My grammar may not have been perfect, nor could I always remember the right words, but it felt great when I could converse with people and we understood one another. It was definitely worth it and made me much more confident in my Spanish speaking abilities. If you're a native English speaker, look into teaching in a Spanish speaking country; you're essentially getting paid to travel and get the added benefit of improving you language skills!</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I wouldn't say she blames me for having my illnesses, it's more that she blames me for everything that goes wrong in our friendship. I get that everyone has their limits, but she has vowed to not abandon me. She just likes to take breaks from me, which I don't handle well AT ALL. She actually used to be my therapist when I was in a residential facility, so I think some parts of our relationship as friends are just weird now. It was a shift for both of us in how we relate to one another, to say the least. I just want so badly to make things better, but all she wants to do is not talk to me. In my opinion, talking things out is far more beneficial than one of us ignoring the other.</TEXT>

Because she is now my FP, I tend to split on her, which I never did as her client. I guess that's a big part of why she gets so fed up with me. I wish I didn't split like I do, but it's become much more rare; hopefully I'll be able to get it under control and make things easier for both of us.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>The safety there honestly depends on where you are. The bigger cities, like San Pedro Sula and Tegucigalpa can be quite dangerous. I lived in a small tourist town, though, so I felt completely safe there. It's really up to you how much of each language you speak. I spent time talking to the Spanish speaking teachers and we were basically conversation partners so they could practice English and I could practice my Spanish. There are also many opportunities to speak Spanish if you get out and about outside of school hours. For example, I attended a couple of Bible studies with the woman I lived with and those certainly helped to improve my listening skills.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I have tried just about everything out there, including the things mentioned by others here. I have had 12 ECT treatments, around 30 TMS treatments, tried Spravato, and have been on almost every med you can try. In my personal experience, ECT did absolutely nothing for me. TMS was effective for a short period of time, but wore off. Spravato actually made my suicidal ideations worse after about 4 treatments, so my psychiatrist stopped the treatment. And as far as meds go, they only sort of help to control my symptoms; but I still experience severe depression, chronic suicidality, and anxiety. I don't want to discourage you from trying these things, as all can be rather effective for some people. Everything affects people differently. Just wanted to share my experiences with you.

    <TEXT>I tell my therapist everything. I guess I figure it would feel like a waste of time for both of us (and a waste of money for me) if I withheld things from her. Plus, I wouldn't really be working on any of the things that I truly need to work on if I hid them.</TEXT>

    <TITLE>I quit my job yesterday and I feel great!</TITLE>

    <TEXT>Recently, the supervisor that I absolutely adored left and was replaced by a promoted coworker that I absolutely cannot stand. I just know that work will become a hostile and toxic environment for me if I stay and I don't want that, so I put my 2 weeks notice in. I am finally doing something good for myself and putting my well being first. I am happy to report that I already have an interview with another company! Fingers crossed that I'll find something great!  #8203; Update...I didn't get the first job I interviewed for; but the employer said it was solely because she couldn't give me as many shifts as I need. It was nice to be told that I did great at an interview and that she thought I would be great at the job if she'd had more work for me. I tend to believe things happen for a reason, though, so I'm sure there's still something out there for me.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I love helping people, in whatever manner that might be. The job I just quit is at a substance abuse rehab facility and it has been truly amazing to be even a small part of each client's journey. I love watching the clients grow and change from when they first get here. I also love teaching; I actually spent some time teaching English in Honduras and that is really my passion...just don't feel like I'm stable enough mentally to be out of the country alone again, unfortunately.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I started ECT when I was 25 and had 12 treatments within that year. I deal with very severe depression and nearly constant suicidal ideations. ECT was basically the only option for me left to try after multiple suicide attempts. Unfortunately, the treatments had no effect on me.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Lots of meds that sorta control my symptoms. I still have horrible suicidal ideations on the daily, but I'm getting better about at least not letting them get the better of me. I go to the hospital to keep myself safe if it gets too bad. I tried the ketamine thing as well and just ended up back in the hospital. I stay in therapy every 1-2 weeks and just having someone to talk to is nice. Honestly, I'd even be game to try some sorta medical study to see if anything new would help. I am trying to accept that maybe this is just as good as it gets for me.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I once had a therapist tell me she couldn't help me. I suppose her intentions were good and she just wanted me to find someone else who could actually be of help to me, but man did it feel shitty. I have BPD and I know people often say that clinicians don't really like working with people like me, but I certainly didn't expect this to happen. I still think about this and wonder if I'm just too fucked up and beyond help.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Thank you for this reminder. I actually have a therapist now that I really like, it's just hard to shake the memory of being told that the other one couldn't help me. I think perhaps she could have worded it better when telling me; by saying that she thought I needed someone more suited to my specific needs.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I have tried, the therapist that I went to wasn't great and wanted to make me work through a CBT workbook first. I did 5 months in residential and know CBT like the back of my hand, so it was super frustrating to me. My current therapist is great, she just always asks me how I feel if this is as good as it gets for me. Kinda disheartening,</TEXT>

    <TEXT>That's awful, that's when you need your therapist the most. BPD is rough and everyone always says that most clinicians don't like working with us. I have been lucky to have two good therapists, it just feels like I'm always saying the same things though, and can't change things no matter how hard I try. My therapist and psychiatrist seem to agree that my suicidal thoughts will probably never go away. Talk about something that makes you feel hopeless.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I agree. And people always over simplify it by saying that if you just force yourself to do the things that you'll feel better. In my experience, though, that is far from true. It's like, how is showering going to help me? It's not.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Therapy is different for everyone. I don't think you really find ways to "fix" issues, but you gain tools to better deal with things that you are going through.</TEXT>
