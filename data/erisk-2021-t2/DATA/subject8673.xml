    <TEXT>Good Luck!! When I was 15 games looked like this on the PC and I tryed to make them but was not able, so keep up. I would recomend looking for consistent Lighting and Overall style. When I look through your code I see that your looking for Components. I dont know if you generating all from scratch. Otherwise I would go with \[SerializeFields\] to preset them on the Prefab, so you dont have to search for them. because you know that they are there.Try to Avoid I.... when using CamelCase for anything exept Interfaces that make reading your code more easy. I defenetly like that you comment everything! but be consistent on your style. Mixing Caps and Lowercase comments is confusing.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>There should be other questions. Why bake when using realtim Lighting? It all depends on your scope and target plattform. there are alot of Shadow techniques and you always have to balance between quality and performance. With every shadowcasting light and each cascade you have to draw each shadow caster is an additional drawcall. there are some optimisations for batching but that requires alot of work for the asset creation and level art. On my professional Project we use One Cascade and draw the distance shadows as SDF shadows. they have less detail and a huge Problem when it comes to transparancy but it turns out visual quality and performance went up compared to 4 cascadet shadwmaps. On our private project we build a topdown open world RPG for Mobile. There we have different requirements. Save Drawcalls and minimize the shader complexity. Also take in mind that GI/AO makes a big difference on visuals and shadow areas, there are also good techniques you can go with.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Looks ambitious . but as u/ReZpawner said It needs a bit more love. What I can say is that the SSAO you use is to strong compared to the Lighting Function. It looks like forward rendering because it seams you dont take the Lighting buffer into acount to your SSAO. For a FPS game you need to have a different SSAO approach or connect is with your Lighting. because AO apear strong only in shadowed areas. It means the Ambient is occludet means it should not affect the direct lighting. I think putting some work in this little detail will boost the Visual quality already. cheers robin</TEXT>

    <TEXT>For the SSAO I use Depth comparision of a 4sample Blured depth map an the original deph map. Its pretty fast but have the downside that you cant adjust the AO depending on the Screen normal. so its is a pretty cheap technique that does the Job. But I need to Optimize it a bit more.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>It looks like you put alot of work into It. But it looks like a PC game and you can go further with at least some Post FX to get a more spooky atmosphere. And dont go full black if there is a campfire near by. you have at least some light bouncing through the whole subway. work with eye adaption to make your tunnels look dark but not full black. For me in a Zombi horror game is more about atmosphere then gunplay. Maybe limit the movement or turnspeed instead of limit the view(no light) Just Look at the resident evil games or Metro. they dont have complete black levels. I hope this helps you to improve the visual quality.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>There are already so many sollutions. And I agree with most of them. I would build a new List out of the existing going over each element and sort that by insertion. With that you have your filter. this is more the Database approach when requesting an ordered List by some column from the Database. but you can apply that functionality to your problem aswell. I would not reorder the existing list that is located in the businesslogic to prepare a view. Look for the MVC pattern. the View Requests and Gets its data and react to the model but never changing it. the model only changes itself when it gets an input like keyinput \[A\]</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Good first start.2 Things. 1st: low polycount is not required for mobile development, our game can have 1-2 million triangles on the screen and manage 30+ fps. 2nd bake at least AO lighting since the level is static. move your buttons from the bottom center of the screen to the upper left or right.the lower center of the screen is for most games for skills or consumables. Try always to go with known behaviours. look at candycrush or angry birds how they located the buttons.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>No one asked for it but I think its a pretty neat sollution to draw grassblades and give them an actual thickness and it works with instancing so all Grassblades are instanced. The Grassblade itself is a very thin triangle strip with UV 2 define the shape from -1 to 1. In the vertexshader I calculate the +-X screen coordinate and extend the triangle strip. additional to that they are fully opaque what makes the Z-Test and Z-Write work accurate and save overdraw It also works with my SSAO-shader as you saw in the previous screenshots of my game.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Yeah these new Screens are not as good as they look like. I dont think there is some information providet by the phone so Unity can preview that. I think you need to create a somple texture for it that matches the screen as good as possible so you can align your UI. Its a lot of work but you can check what device it is and Load different layouts of your UI. We did that to make Ipad and Iphone have a good layout for the different ratios and screensizes. Maybe that helps</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Now I got it working. pivot based vertex-wind animations. I could have achieved this with simple transformations. But for me its always a jurney to try new techniques and workflows. And you can also see that I experienced with a ground texture and more assets to get a bit more feeling about the style the game could go for. What maybe sound a bit wired but I callange myself to build all systems and assets myself. Only the animations I got from a friend for testing my playercontroller. And now after a week on reddit I know why people just hype it that much. It is just nice place and a colaborate community. There are always one, two or more ppl who give valuable feedback. Thanks for this experience!</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Nice one. I like the idea of procedural content creation and I think you did a good job on the additional, small asset placement. Now the bad feedback comes into place. Think of dynamic neighborhood. there Trailers have to be draged there some how. How did the Park grow. are there People who are friends when they joint, or started to get friends after they have moved there. so the trailers should be aranged in clumbs and have some relations. Also people lived there. and created some additional tends. Parked Cars bycicles all that stuff. Depends on the Age of the Park the nature sould have overgrown some of the trailers. I know most of them require additional Assets. but the first Scatter of the Trailer need a better Relation to each other. and also some pathes for cars and people.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I tryed to create a viewspace approximation on a relatively lowres texture to create a visual pleasing Effect for Dungeons or Indoors for my game. It basicly takes a Rendertexture and sets a global float to define its location much like a spotlight without all the lightsystem overhead. How can I use it for Gameplay? I can simply calculate the Position of a Pixel on the environment and decide if something is visable or not to the player or the AI. This could also be used to approximate a check if a soundsource is occludet by a wall or somthing. Next up is to implement it into the actual Game environment. I am really appriciate every feedback beacause its my first implementation approach and can be defenetly improved. or maybe some hints to other sollutions.</TEXT>

Because Trailerparks are build in most cases by dropouts who want to leave the Fast, expensive life with not that much money. Thats at least my Imagination. Its pretty hard to find some good algorythms to cover that growth. I thinks its much Like scatter believeable forest or rock arangements.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>The calculation is A camera with 179 #176; FOV so it is Rendering a custom LP geometry. The Idea was to use the GPU rasterization to Perform a fast Approximation, to later just read the Texture just like an array if an Object is visable. This also could have a Visibility range approximation if the pixels brightness is 128 for example. That was at least the Idea. so it is PPx on the Rendertexture. thanks for your feedback! I will look if I can find the Video. I imagine A TextureLookup is a pretty fast even on the CPU because it is a linea Array. close to a 2D hashmap. So I thought it is a good approach. a Meshbased Approach requires multiple raycasts to know where the occluders are. I come from GPU programming, this may biased me a bit. I will look into Sebastian Lagues sollution and check what is the faster approach. Thanks alot!</TEXT>

    <TEXT>If you ask yourself why the hell hexfields and not the Unity Terrain? I tryed to Optimize Landscape Rendering by assuming that I render a max of 3Tiles on a Landscape Transition. Because I dont need LODing or something else I decidet to use Displaces Meshes.I Used Houdini to generate the Hexfields out of a Landscape from Houdini. this is such a Huge Task.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Good Approach but you dont need to downsample it. Because Vram is not an issue anymore and you sample the buffer anyways per pixel the downsample performance improvement ist only Useful when rendering Post FX and doing calculations such as blur or depth comparison. Because downsampling is there fore 2 reasons save VRam and save calculations on pixel base. the Downsampling in this case makes the Water ripples just bad. And once you render the Water Post Opaque you can simply sample the screenbuffer after the opaque pass with full res. One thing is you could have used is Planar reflections and reduce the capture resolution by 2 or 3. Because a camera capture have to do a few things per pixel. but there are also the Drawcalls relevant. You could set a rendermask to the objects that are most prominent to the Image. Like the Colored blocks or the Landscape in the background.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Totally got your point. but it is not required. Once you sample the Screenbuffer of the opaque passes your good to go, so you require no extra vram ;-) the other thing. Reflection captures are Spherical and lead to bad Reflections on big surfaces like lakes. the others are Parralx corrected cubemaps and they are relatively expensive. When implementing Planar reflections with a verry low Resolution like 512x512 your imagequality will be so much betten and the overhead is minimal when you optimize your drawcalls. I just want to help you on this I have worked on optimization for Mobile on multiple Games one of them was Sacred Legends. that was before SRP or URP was on the horizon. On Mobile the bottleneck is not the VRam it is the bandwith and the processing power. and with open GL:ES2 to 3.5 its the Drawcall data that costs the most performance. and Vulkan is yet not supported on all Mobile platforms. Thats at least my experience.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>You can still Use Cubemap reflections for the other assets. Just disable the Reflectionprobes for the Waterplane. The other objects can still use it. We implemented the feature for the iPhone 4+ so It is not that expensive. The Camera is Just Refect the Orientation trough the surface normal.

    <TEXT>yes planar for the water. and cubemap for the rest. how many cobemaps is not relevant. since I expect you to do forward rendering the complexity scales linea to the resolution of the screen. so setting the gameres to 2/3 of your devices res already helps. It even samples subpixels and give a smooter end result. But always keep in mind everything that is reflected by the planar reflection is rendered twice. you also can use a shader override for the reflection and use a less expensive tech like only diffuse and global cubemap ect. That should give you a good aproximation of what is reflected but save a ton of performance.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>:-/ sorry. but one big inspiration was Fable. Mayby lookup dynamic mesh creation. because most of the skinning stuff are just Vertex informations. One big problem is to maintain the Bonestructure through multiple batched meshes because the Skinning always counts from the first skinned bone, the order is always different because of this. The sollution is to check the Bindposes of the Bones to fixup the references.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>What does steam wothy mean? The Style looks good executed but Inconsistent. I dont find the hooks yet. The water have a good level of quality but is missing a Uniqueness. Then there is a Missmatch between the style itself. the water looks realistic but is not reflecting the mood. for example the fog in the Skybox is not affecting the Ocean. The Plants do not catch the Light but cast shadows. In contrast the Rock in the background does. The rock also looks like he is on the wrong place. where story came into place. What wants the Image to tell me? The Only question is Why is there a mountain-sized boulder on the Beach? I do not get any clue about the Game, what it is all about? is this a Pirate game? add a Chest to the sand and maybe a skeletal captain who wanted to protect the Chest. Just google: Environmental Storytelling. I dont want to be rude or something. I made the same mistakes so dont feel offended just take my notes and improve it.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>replace this with Vector3 and float3. what I think fits better when using ECS and stuff. Because Vector is a Reference Datatype. that comes at the coast of referencing 3 floats instead of a float\[\] where all floats are lined up correctly and save 3Pointer because you just adress \[0\]. Learn C is like opening the door and walk out in the wildernis. Or... Stay inside your protecting house and look out of the window and ask yourself why all the other games... made with unity run so much faster.</TEXT>
