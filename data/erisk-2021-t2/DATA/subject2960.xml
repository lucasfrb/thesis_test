    <TEXT>Refereeing is a great option to try out. I had to quit playing as well, due to some concussions. Picked up refereeing and learned to enjoy that. It can take a bit of time though before you start enjoying it (as it can be quite overwhelming and it's more difficult than it seems). Overall I believe it's a great way to learn new skills which will help you all throughout daily life as well: managing people, overview of situations, challenging your learning curve and very important: learning to recognize, respond or anticipate abuse from people. I spent a year in Scotland (Edinburgh) and got in touch with Edinburgh Rugby Referee Society. I got a very warm welcome and have been mentored and trained there. Can surely recommend trying such.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>My advice from personal experience would be: If you don't know what you'll specifically like to work in or what you'll be good at, try to aim for getting a job, which at least seems ok to you, within an industry or company that: - suits your interests in a sense that you'll be happy to contribute to its main cause. - is a growing environment (this opens up more possibilities to switch roles or see more aspects of work). - pick a boss and colleagues that you'll be able to learn from. Understand that's it's a privilege to be able to think about what you would like to do in your life (as surely not everyone has those circumstances). But also acknowledge that it can be dooming, as there's a big chance to get stuck in endless questioning what would ever suit you. Job descriptions seem boring as fuck, you don't even know if you'll enjoy it or whatever you're good at, what even makes you happy?! Therefore if you get stuck in such endless doubt, it's sometimes better to just start a job or studies and just see where it takes you. Choose an environment rather than a specific job. The earlier mentioned privilege of being able to doubt about what you should pursue in life, in itself should also mean that circumstances in your life are allowing you to quit or switch whenever your situation sucks. This means: why not give it a try? You can always quit. Sometimes this mindset is better than waiting for the 'perfect' job/studies/whatever to arrive.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>It has always amazed me how Americans (I'm assuming OP is from the USA) seem to have such a singular view of 'Europe'.. As if the whole continent is just one place / country, which you have either visited or not. Perhaps it's due to the scale of the USA (and it's lack of cultural diversity), but it seems as if often times they have no clue that going to Norway is completely different to Portugal. The Netherlands is already very different to Germany. Try comparing a French person to one from Hungary. Or Swedes versus Greek. Culture, weather, geography, history, economy, almost everything is different.. Hence, one can't advice you what the best season would be to visit 'Europe'..</TEXT>

    <TEXT>The climate in the places you've mentioned differ quite a bit. Especially Spain is very different compared to the rest on your list (also really depends on where you're going in Spain. For The Netherlands, winter months are cold (0-10 degrees Celsius). Same pretty much goes for UK (London), Paris and (most of) Germany. London is a bit less cold, but can be more rainy. Whereas most of Spain will have it warmer (10-20 degrees) with more sunlight due to its latitude, especially in the South. The Northwest of Spain is rainy and cold though, as are some other (mostly mountainous) parts of Spain. If you want to increase your chances of having nice weather in countries in Northern- and Western Europe, aim for anywhere between May and September. In those months though, parts of Southern Europe (As is Spain) might be too warm for some..</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Which months are you going? Most of England isn't that cold actually, even in winter. Usually it will be between 0-15 degrees Celsius during winter months. Those temperatures are surely doable by layering clothes. You'll find suitable clothes all around in shops when you've arrived. What's actually more important imo is getting a good winter jacket / coat that's water proof. Don't forget an umbrella either ;)</TEXT>

    <TEXT>It's a great thing Scottish national rugby is so heavily supported. However, when I lived in Edinburgh last year I was truly amazed by the gap between the support for national games and the support for local club rugby. Every damn Scotland game was quickly sold out, but a regular week game for Edinburgh didn't even attract a half a Myreside stadium (capacity of 5500 or so).. I know it's a bit better in Glasgow though, but still a big gap..</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Goodreads app could help you with that. Furthermore, I use the Evernote app for all books I read to write down: - Keeping a list of books I've read per month. - Writing down all key takeaways or moments from the book. I occasionally scroll through this list to better memorize the knowledge. - After finishing the book, I usually write my review in Evernote and post it on Goodreads. Also, I tend to write down my thoughts in the books when I'm reading it (got this from my grandpa). Underscore what's important and you can always re-read key takeaways quickly. It's also good fun to re-read the book a few years later and see how 'former you' perceived the information at the time. All these points could help you with summarizing a book as well I reckon.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>As someone who can relate deeply to what you describe, I can surely advice you (and others who can relate) to consider improving yourself through seeing a doctor, good psychologist and possibly medication (if you're not doing those already). Even though it can be so, so very difficult, it's often worth the effort and pain. Imagine moving towards a life where the beautiful thing called cycling is not the thing that is keeping you alive, but enhancing your already doable life. That is, a life that would be fine/worthwhile without cycling or any other great activities (which might sound very unrealistic to you at this moment, but surely is possible).</TEXT>

    <TEXT>After living in the UK for a while (I'm Dutch), I completely understand your feelings. In my experience, the lack of sufficient cycling infrastructure is a key factor in unsatisfactory cycling in cities. Perhaps you could find a way to use the negative energy to lobby for (or promote) more separate cycling paths in your city? Not having to share the majority of the road with huge vehicles, makes it so much safer and more fun for everyone. Or just move to the Netherlands (or Denmark), we do a fair bit of cycling you see. Most paths are separated from the rest of the road.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Of course stealing happens. It happens everywhere, also in Western Europe. It does happen to very different extends, probably depending majorly on inequality and lack of well being. Literally never heard or read about someone's wheels being stolen like this in The Netherlands though...</TEXT>

    <TEXT>If they indeed need time alone, then truly let them have time alone. I would suggest to not be in the same house (surely not when you're just beginning this journey). If it's your house (even if shared with your wife), it really is best if they go somewhere else. In case you'll feel left out or lovely, you do NOT want to feel being left out in your own house. As you don't sound too confident in your question and context, general advice would surely be to reconsider to what extent you want this form of relationship/lifestyle as well. What are the main drivers for you to do this and are they in your own best interests? (Furthermore, are they in other's best interests as well)?</TEXT>

    <TEXT>That's basically what most of Europe was like. Always feels pretty ironic when us Western Europeans tell countries like Brazil and Indonesia not to cut down their forests, while we've done most of it over here (don't get me wrong, the current rates of cutting down rainforests is devastating).</TEXT>

    <TEXT>The North sea is actually very windy, so wind swells occur quite often. Also it's open to groundswells from the north (all the way in between Iceland and Norway). However, the north sea is pretty shallow, so most ground swell can't pass through to NL amp;Belgium. North east of Scotland amp;England do get amazing swells from far up north though.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Yeah modern forecasting indeed. It seems that the more inconsistency there is, the more accuracy you need. In NL for example, you need all variables/factors to be clicking, which are often only short time frames. You need the right winds, tides (north swell needs a high tide push), daylight, 5-7 second period, the right sand banks that can hold/fit the specific swell). Sometimes it looks great on paper and then there's nothing... Modern forecasting makes it easier and more reliable to find those moments (then sometimes the biggest challenge is to make that combine with the rest of your life).</TEXT>

    <TEXT>This was my 4th board. There's a proper learning curve, so your first few boards take a lot of time. My first one was a 9'6 longboard that I copied from a friend. Because it was a big board, it felt less crucial to get everything right. Besides, I'm lucky to have some friends who shape a lot and were willing to teach me. A lot can be learned via YouTube as well.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Sounds dope!! It is pretty difficult, but everything can be learned via youtube. It's not too expensive, as you'll end up with a new surfboard for way less than buying it from a professional shaper or shop. Best thing is to look for a shaping place you can rent that has all the equipment.</TEXT>
