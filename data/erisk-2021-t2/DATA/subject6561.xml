    <TEXT>As a Chief Officer (2nd in command) of one of these ships myself, I'm guessing the steering went out. Likely not the steering pump because there's a backup for that. My question is why they did not put it in Astern (go backwards)? You might not have stopped it at that speed, but you could have certainly slowed it down. Also. once up on the rocks, FUCKING STAY THERE. If you had put a hole in the hull, you've now opened it up to massive flooding and spillage (though this ship looks empty or close to it).</TEXT>

    <TEXT>What I'm saying is, they likely lost steering on the approach. If you didn't have steering upon arrival, you'd stop engines and call for a tug immediately. At this point in the video, put your engines full astern (slowly, of course!!!) and try to minimize the impact. At that speed, I doubt you'd avoid collision, though. I'm heading down to inspect my ballast tanks right now. I'll read up on this after work and see what happened. I am curious. EDIT: Seems it just happened today. There is no information about it online.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Yes, you can 'collide' with sand or soft mud and not have to worry about damage, generally (except for clogged intakes). if you run too far inland and can't 'reverse', you need to set out your anchor to prevent inshore creep, and wait for high tide to get out.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Throwing the engine into reverse is a quick way to shut down your engines. you need to slow down the speed of the propeller before reversing it. Ships have an EOT (Engine Order Telegraph) to send to the requested speed down to the engine room (although some ship can control the speed/thrust from the wheelhouse). [Antique EOT's look like this](https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/1240/0896/products/IMG_9531_76891216-3fce-4d82-b796-d6d49d06465f.jpg?v=1571709870). You can see all the 'stops' you need to make between full ahead and full astern. [More modern EOT's look like this, but it's the same concept.](https://www.kwantcontrols.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/DSC_4688-3199-1.jpg) In laymans terms, you can't just switch a car from 15 mph ahead to 15mph reverse. It's the same with a ship. You can't just stop a propeller from spinning in one direction and start it spinning the other way. you'll shut the engine down and cause [cavitation in your propeller.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cavitation#:~:text=Cavitation%20is%20a%20phenomenon%20in,the%20pressure%20is%20relatively%20low.)</TEXT>

    <TEXT>The 'noose' [had been there](https://theconservativetreehouse.files.wordpress.com/2020/06/bubba-wallace-noose-hoax-9.jpg) since October 2019, [and was justa rope used to close the garage door, FFS](https://www.rt.com/usa/492760-fake-noose-fbi-bubba-wallace/). Every other garage bay [has the same thing](https://twitter.com/TheLastRefuge2/status/1275303280890052609/photo/1), as well as multiple cameras. Didn't anyone wonder why we weren't shown a picture of the noose? [Same shit that happened in Oakland last week.](https://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/ropes-resembling-nooses-found-trees-oakland-investigated-fbi-hate-crime-n1231405) [Joint Statement from U.S. Attorney Jay E. Town and FBI Special Agent in Charge Johnnie Sharp, Jr.](https://www.justice.gov/usao-ndal/pr/joint-statement-us-attorney-jay-e-town-and-fbi-special-agent-charge-johnnie-sharp-jr) Regarding the Noose Found in NASCAR #8217;s Bubba Wallace #8217;s Garage at Talladega Superspeedway- *"On Monday, fifteen FBI special agents conducted numerous interviews regarding the situation at Talladega Superspeedway. After a thorough review of the facts and evidence surrounding this event, we have concluded that no federal crime was committed. The FBI learned that garage number 4, where the noose was found, was assigned to Bubba Wallace last week. The investigation also revealed evidence, including authentic video confirmed by NASCAR, that the noose found in garage number 4 was in that garage as early as October 2019. Although the noose is now known to have been in garage number 4 in 2019, nobody could have known Mr. Wallace would be assigned to garage number 4 last week. The decision not to pursue federal charges is proper after reviewing all available facts and all applicable federal laws. We offer our thanks to NASCAR, Mr. Wallace, and everyone who cooperated with this investigation."* Fake hate crimes are what happens when the demand for racism outweighs the supply.</TEXT>

"Freediving with American crocodiles at  #8220;Gardens of the Queen #8221; in Cuba breaks the reputation of this incredible predator. At the top of the food chain, they regulate the healthy balance of the mangrove ecosystem. Swimming with these predators is the experience of a lifetime and reveals they are not really what we think. They are shy and instinctive with their own personality." Photo by Gregory Lecoeur, France- https://www.greglecoeur.com/</TEXT>

One night about 3-4 years ago, i was passing by Brighton one night at 3 AM and there was ONE channel on the radio, BBC3, IIRC. They were broadcasting a study/documentary on 'queuing' complete with interviews with a 'queuing expert'.

The fire suppression system at the Stop  amp; Shop gas station at the corner of Southern Artery and Sea Street malfunction, causing white foam to coat the ground and nearby cars. Three people experienced trouble breathing and were evaluated by Brewster Ambulance, police said. A gas station spokeswoman said the malfunction was caused by a faulty heat detector, all of which have since been replaced.

    <TEXT>QUINCY, MASS. (WHDH) - Quincy police are letting the public know that  #8220;it didn #8217;t snow in July #8221; after a gas station in the city became surrounded by white foam. The fire suppression system at the Stop  amp; Shop gas station at the corner of Southern Artery and Sea Street malfunction, causing white foam to coat the ground and nearby cars. Three people experienced trouble breathing and were evaluated by Brewster Ambulance, police said. A gas station spokeswoman said the malfunction was caused by a faulty heat detector, all of which have since been replaced.

    <TEXT>I've been to two Dead shows (and one Mickey Hart Planet Drum show). First was LA in 1990 or so, My favorite was the Dead in Atlanta, Feb/March 1992. I'd just gotten out of the Navy and did enough drugs in that first month to make up for the past three years. I got out in Feb 1992 and a friend gave me a joint for the flight. I was stationed in LA and flying to New Orleans, where I was going to hook up with an old Navy buddy (and drug pal) and his hippie friends. I HATED flying and still do. I smoked that entire joint, SOMEHOW made it to my gate, and woke up in New Orleans. Best flight ever. We all road tripped to ATL and camped out at Stone Mountain GA campground. The campground set aside a 'hippie area' for all of us, and the party was ALL NIGHT. Drugs were endless, and after three years in the Nav, i was a kid in a candy store. Right next to our tent a couple of young hippies brought a tank of Nitrous (Literally a 5' tall tank), BURIED it with a Oxygen mask coming out of the ground and were selling hits for a buck or so. Campground got raided, and they literally dug the tank up. There was a group of soldiers down the way that somehow requisitioned a goddamn Humvee and were camping out for the Dead with us. Army haircuts, camo shorts and all. They even had a camo net stretched across their campsite. Cool dudes, skipped the drugs, though. I was a master fire builder (still am!), so all the campers were drawn to our campsite, and the drumming and toking, and mescaline and joint passing never seemed to stop. When I got out of the military, I GOT OUT OF THE MILITARY.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I am embarrassed to say i ignored Vietnamese cuisine for most of my 50 years here on earth. i finally took a 3 month backpacking tour of SE Asia 8 years ago, and while Thai cuisine was hands-down-bar none-the-best, Vietnamese cuisine was the best for your money. I could stop into any little hole-in-the-wall Viet joint and get a great meal for under $2. As a matter of fact, the best meal I had in my whole 3 months was a $1.25 bowl of Chicken Pho in Saigon. Flew back home to NH, and started eating at the Vietnamese joint in town. It was literally as good as anything I had overseas. Kissed their ass on Yelp, but it was no good,....they closed a year later.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Did you visit the parking lot of that show? I distinctly remember a phalanx of HUGE cops, black and white walking down 'Shakedown Street' looking for 'drug deals to bust'. It was fairly ridiculous to watch these cops in 1992 dressed like SWAT patrolling a parking lot full of hippies. IIRC, they were called the 'Red Dog' squad or somesuch. It was kind if funny to watch these professional wrestler-looking types patrolling an area where they were constantly being bombarded with offers of 'try my vegan burritos'.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I've seen them 3 times. Loved fugazi. Still do. Last time i saw them was in Hollywood, 1991 or so. i didn;t have a car, so asked a (Navy) friend to drive me in exchange for a ticket (they were $5, so what?). He was from deep Alabama, hadn't' been to too many shows. We were in this huge line wrapped around the Palladium waiting for the doors to open. Who walks by? Fugazi. Playing it cool, i said "That's them." to my friend. He said, "Who?". I said "that';s the band w'ere going to see tonight". I could see the gears in his head turning. He expected a concert with backstage passes and a big tour bus and a big Van Halen-type dressing room. the fact that 4-5 average duddes walking around (not being bothered by anyone) were the ACTUAL BAND WE WERE THERE TO SEE was difficult to comprehend for him.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>About a dozen years ago, I worked on a ship that was being brought to the scrapyard. One of the crewmembers (not a professional mariner) wanted a souvenir from the trip (it was a fairly memorable one, to be fair). She could have had anything, as there was plenty of antique knick-knacks and shit all over. What did she want? a sprinkler head. Not just ANY sprinkler head- I had a box of spares I would have been happy to give her. No, she wanted the one in her cabin, her reasoning being she used to lay in her rack and stare at the sprinkler head and contemplate life. Anyways, the last day of the voyage, we were at the scrapyard, and her last act before we shut everything down was to scamper down to her cabin with a wrench and remove her sprinkler head. As this was a 50-year old ship, you can imagine the condition of the water that came out, covered her, and covered her entire cabin. She did keep the sprinker head though. It certainly brought back alot more memories at that point.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>1. -Its not my business. 2.- Yes, when a truck shears off a sprinkler head, causing water to spray all over the garage, and the fire department has to be called and the %#$# hotel evacuated, then for safety #8217;s sake, every business out there will choose bar guests from the parking garage until the water is stopped, and yes it will be as a consequence of the sprinkler head being torn off. EDIT: i should have checked your username before responding.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Ok, listen- Think this through. You're working/managing in a hotel. the fire Alarm goes off. You don't know what set it off. A fire? a short? Some guy smashing the sprinkler head? You don't know. do you waste time and send a clerk down to the parking lot to make sure there isn't a fire? Or do you do what you were trained to do when the fire alarm goes off? Evacuate the hotel. 99 out of 100 managers will evacuate the hotel and sort it out later. and by the time the Fire Dept. gets there, gets prepped and figures out the problem, the hotel will have been evacuated.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>From WIki- Wagner was born in 1877, in Lyon County, Kansas, to David Van Buran Stevens and Sarah Jane McGee. Wagner was an aerialist and contortionist, working in numerous traveling circuses. She met Gus Wagner #8212;a tattoo artist who described himself as "the most artistically marked up man in America" while traveling with circuses and sideshows #8212;at the Louisiana Purchase Exposition (World's Fair) in 1904, where she was working as an aerialist. She exchanged a romantic date with him for a lesson in tattooing, and several years later they were married. Together they had a daughter, Lotteva, who started tattooing at the age of nine and went on to become a tattoo artist herself. As an apprentice of her husband, Wagner learned how to give traditional "hand-poked" tattoos #8212;despite the invention of the tattoo machine #8212;and became a tattooist herself.[4] Together, the Wagners were two of the last tattoo artists to work by hand, without the aid of modern tattoo machines.[5] Maud Wagner was the United States' first known female tattoo artist. After leaving the circus, Maud and Gus Wagner traveled around the United States, working both as tattoo artists and "tattooed attractions" in vaudeville houses, county fairs and amusement arcades. They are credited with bringing tattoo artistry inland, away from the coastal cities and towns where the practice had started.

    <TEXT>"January 21, 1984. Our cat is in her favorite place, Father having provided himself with a protective covering using the Sunday papers. The day before was his 82nd birthday, and everybody - the whole family plus grandkids - have gathered this Saturday for the celebration and traditional Big Deal Dinner in the dining room. Other photos in this set show that Mother has made a prime rib with pan-roasted potatoes. She was originally my brother's cat; we adopted her some 14 or so years earlier when he got a teaching job in Spain. He'd named her "Radio Mary Fubash." My folks wisely chose to call her "Kitty." Outside, when not doing typical cat things like lurking in the bushes, she'd follow Father around all over as he worked in the yard or just relaxed. I think that some dog DNA must have somehow sneaked into her ancestry." Source-https://www.shorpy.com/node/13125?size=_original#caption</TEXT>

Spent most of their time fucking off, hiding, and coming inside our berthing area, even eating our fucking food. for the locals, it seemed more of a jobs program than anything.

Sunday afternoon, 'dad' was a (what we'd call today) a complete Neckbeard. He stared at the ceiling while his 2 offspiring devoured their Happy Meals. When they were all done, he waddled his kids outside. When I look ed over at his table, it was full of their trash. It wasn't a big deal, took me 30 seconds to clean, but this was my first introduction to people who don't clean up after themselves. Not a big deal n 2020. Trashed tables are common. but in 1986, people not cleaning up after themselves was an event. I actuallly stared at thier tables, as i literally could not fathom somebody too lazy to clean up after themselves- AT FUCKING McDONALDS!. Anyways, old man rant over.</TEXT>

Everyone knows all the nice Disney-fied fairy tales, nobody knows the Cask of Amontillado. what a sad culture we have. I'm 50, and whenever I have to walk down a long circuitous hallway/passageway, i can't help but crack "Is there a cask of Amontillado down here"? Nobody **ever** gets the joke, but I cannot stop making it. Every time i do, I feel like some crewmember half my age is going to post the incident in /r/iamverysmart Stephen King rewrote it some years back in his short story, 'Dolan's Cadillac' Great Story.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Bless you. The Cask of Amontillado is a short story written by Edgar Allen Poe in 1846. Edgar Allen Poe (EAP) tended to write stories that were pretty dark, consisting of murder and similar themes. The Cask of Amontillado is a short story (written in 1846) about an Italian 'nobleman', and is told from his point of view. A local jackass (Fortunato) talks shit about him behind his back, so during a local festival, the narrator tells Fortunato "I've got a cask of Amontillado back home, DEEP in my wine cellar. Want to come appraise it?" Fortunato (of course) says HELL YES, and they head back to (the narrator's) home. They walk deep deep deep into the wine cellar of the narrator, him feeding Fortunato wine to keep him drunk. They arrive at the 'Cask of Amontillado' (which doesn't exist), and the narrator chains a drunk fortunato to the wall. He then spend hours building a brick wall in the wine cellar, effectively entombing Fortunato to a miserable, quiet death...where nobody will even known he's gone. It's basically the #1 all-time post of /r/myevilplan in real life;. If you want to read a more modern version, check out Stephen King's story 'Dolan's Cadillac'.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>You're exactly right. Poe was stationed at Castle Island in 1827, and was likely inspred by a 'ghost story' going around there/then. As Wikipedia says- An apocryphal legend holds that the inspiration for "The Cask of Amontillado" came from a story Poe had heard at Castle Island (South Boston), Massachusetts, when he was a private stationed at Fort Independence in 1827.[10] According to this legend, he saw a monument to Lieutenant Robert Massie. Historically, Massie had been killed in a sword duel on Christmas Day 1817 by Lieutenant Gustavus Drane, following a dispute during a card game.[11] The legend states other soldiers then took revenge on Drane by getting him drunk, luring him into the dungeon, chaining him to a wall, and sealing him in a vault.[12] This version of Drane's demise is false; Drane was courtmartialled for the killing and acquitted,[11] and lived until 1846.[13] A report of a skeleton discovered on the island may be a confused remembering of Poe's major source, Joel Headley's "A Man Built in a Wall",[14] which recounts the author's seeing an immured skeleton in the wall of a church in Italy.[15] Headley's story includes details very similar to "The Cask of Amontillado"; in addition to walling an enemy into a hidden niche, the story details the careful placement of the bricks, the motive of revenge, and the victim's agonized moaning. Poe may have also seen similar themes in Honor #233; de Balzac's La Grande Bret #232;che (Democratic Review, November 1843) or his friend George Lippard's The Quaker City, or The Monks of Monk Hall (1845).[16] Poe may have borrowed Montresor's family motto Nemo me impune lacessit from James Fenimore Cooper, who used the line in The Last of the Mohicans (1826).[17]</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Yes. i am a ships officer on a USNS vessel. Every ship, like every place of business, is different. Granted, some are very similar. If there was a fire on the ship alongside me, I would have no issues- it is a carbon copy of mine. But not every ship is similar. Imagine you worked at Walmart and were required to fight a fire at the Hobby Lobby/Target/Kohl's next door. Granted there are 'basic similarities', but are those similarities close enough that you'd feel comfortable fighting the fire? Exactly!</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Maritime Firefighters are NOT full time firefighters. It is literally the smallest aspect of their (multi-faceted) job. We are trained to fight shipboard fires,...and little else. To be fair, At the gangway ( the 'entrance to the ship') we have a copy of the FIRE PLAN, a map pf the ship, including the location of all the fire-fighting equipment. STILL, when you're charging into a fire, last thing you want to do is read a 'map'. IOW, we try to reduce the 'unknown territory' aspect as much as possible.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>**ingredients** * 1 Whole watermelon * 1 cup coconut water * 5 teaspoons unflavored gelatin **Instructions** * Slice your watermelon right in half, using a heavy knife. * Scoop out the flesh of your watermelon, putting it into a high power blender to puree. * Pour the leftover juice through a strainer and into a container. * Puree the watermelon. Pour that through the strainer into the same container as the watermelon juice. * Keep straining until you have about two cups of pure juice. * Into a pot, combine your gelatin, coconut water, and watermelon juice. Let it sit for two minutes for the gelatin to dissolve. * Turn the burner on low and whisk all the ingredients together in your pot for two solid minutes. * Next, you #8217;ll need to pour the gelatin mixture into your container  #8211; your empty watermelon. * Pat out the watermelon so it #8217;s dry before you pour in the watermelon gelatin. * Let the jello sit in the fridge for 4-6 hours before serving.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Great story. I went down to the loading flat about a week before we started shelling the Iraqi's. I asked the GMG2 which was the first shell that was going to be fired. He pointed to one already lined up in the elevator. I asked if i could have the cap off of it as a memento. He said "Naw, the Capt already has dibs." I plucked a spare cap off the shelf, switched it out with the one in the elevator, and said "What he don't know won't hurt him." He just rolled his eyes and shook his head. "Only you, subject6561." It's still on my dad's mantelpiece. My GQ station was Turret #2. If the 1989 USS Iowa incident had happened on the Mo, I'd have been the fourth to go.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>WELLSVILLE  #8212; The Pink House continues to fascinate, 150 years after the Victorian home was constructed on the corner of West State Street and South Brooklyn Avenue in the Village of Wellsville. The signature structure is the topic of a recent book,  #8220;The Pink House: The Legendary Residence of Edwin Bradford Hall and His Succeeding Generations in Wellsville, NY. #8221; Allegany County Historian Craig Braack relayed some of the story behind the book during the December meeting of the Resource Management Committee. The book was written by Dr. William Paquette, himself a native of nearby Allentown who graduated from Wellsville, Braack said. Paquette is a retired history professor who spent years researching the Pink House and its founding family.

    <TEXT>Mammatus clouds are pouch-like protrusions hanging from the undersides of clouds, usually thunderstorm anvil clouds but other types of clouds as well. Composed primarily of ice, these cloud pouches can extend hundreds of miles in any direction, remaining visible in your sky for perhaps 10 or 15 minutes at a time. People associate them with severe weather, and it #8217;s true they can appear around, before or after a storm. Contrary to myth, they don #8217;t continue extending downward to form tornados, but they are interesting in part because they #8217;re formed by sinking air. Most clouds are formed by rising air. Mammatus clouds can appear ominous. But, in a way that #8217;s so common in nature, their dangerous aspect goes hand in hand with a magnificent beauty. [More here](https://earthsky.org/earth/amazing-photos-of-mammatus-clouds#:~:text=Mammatus%20clouds%20are%20pouch%2Dlike,15%20minutes%20at%20a%20time.)

    <TEXT>We had a Compass Adjustor show up on San Francisco, just before a 3-day trip up to Portland. I met him at the ganagway and he was no less than 400 lbs. His face was red red red just walking up the gangway. i escorted him to the bridge and directed him to the ladder to get on top so he could do his Compass Work. (Adjusting the Magnetic compass, as the ship had been at the dock for over a year). I immediately went downstairs looking for the AED (Heart Start), as i had a feeling i'd be using it before the day was over. We threw off lines and went out into SF bay for an hour so he could do his thing. He finished around dark, grrabbed his gear, and made his way to the main deck as we were rounding Alcatraz. As we were out in the bay he had to climb down the Jacobs Ladder onto the Pilot boat just like you see this here. He got about halfway down and froze. He started swinging back and forth, and before you know it, he just fell the last 20-25 feet onto the Pilot boat. We were told he'd broken his arm, and the boat was heading to shore to get him to a hospital. We called 911, but realized nobody knew where to send them, and we didn't know where the pilot boat was going to dock. When it was all over and we were outbound SF, the Bosun called up to the bridge and said, "BTW, Capt- we never got a chance to lower his toolbox to him. Whole day was just a clusterfuck.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Living in the rainforests of the New World are 250 species of the world's most flamboyant bees. The "orchid bees" (the euglossini tribe within the bee family Apidae) are found in forests from Mexico to southeastern Brazil. They are easily distinguished from other bees by their extremely long thin tongues, which can equal twice the length of the body, and their shiny metallic coloration. They also have fewer hairs than most other bees. Orchid bees are living jewels. Most kinds are dark green and shiny with sparse hairs, but they can be brilliant blue, purple, red, gold, brassy, or a mixture of these colors on the head, thorax, and abdomen.

    <TEXT>There's actually quite a bit about her online. [Here's a little bit about her i found.](https://alchetron.com/Darcel-Leonard-Wynne) Fun Fact: She's married to one of the Temptations. Darcel made her first national appearance on the hit television series Solid Gold. Darcel's first appearance on Solid Gold was during the two-hour Solid Gold '79. Darcel was one of eight dancers who appeared on the special. Due to the high ratings of Solid Gold '79, the show became a weekly series in late summer 1980. Darcel along with three other dancers (Alexander Cole, Deborah Jenssen, and Paula Beyers) who were on Solid Gold '79 joined Solid Gold once the weekly series started. Another dancer, Gayle Crofoot who was also in Solid Gold '79, appeared on Solid Gold in late 1982. Darcel appeared on the series first four seasons from 1980 to 1984, after which she left the show for a traveling Christian ministry with her husband, Glenn Leonard of the R amp;B soul group The Temptations. During the second season of Solid Gold Darcel received more exposure than the other seven dancers as she was featured dancing solo once or twice during the Top 10 countdown. She returned to Solid Gold during the later part of Season 5 in the summer of 1985. In Season 6 her role on the series enlarged from principal dancer to part-time master of ceremonies, in which she had many speaking parts including regularly announcing the Top 10 countdown. (Darcel was the first celebrity to do David Letterman #8217;s very popular Top 10 countdown on the Late Show with David Letterman.)</TEXT>

He said "Both." Apparently, you can put a sheep up there, but they really don't like it too much, so sometimes you have to mow it. He may have been pulling my leg.</TEXT>

If there was a a rock taller than 6 inches, there'd be a goat standing on it. i walked by a smallish cemetery in one village in Togo, and every gravestone had a goat on it. Not sure if goats could handle Icelandic winters. BTW, the Faroe Islands translates as 'Sheep Islands', and they are everywhere.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I'm reminded of Last Picture Show, which I watched just before moving here 6 years ago, when i chose to be a Texan. 'Simpler time' seems so trite, but sometimes I feel it'd be nice to take a vacation in time. No riots, no internet, no drama. Just riding around in the back of your big brothers pickup, waving to all your friends before going to watch King Kong on the big screen. Have a good weekend, r/Texas. I'm happy to be one of you, now. Hope all y'all are safe.</TEXT>

    <TITLE>Gen-X, Baltimoreans...I have a question about the Eastpoint Mall from 1997 or so. Anyone remember the mall back then that can help???</TITLE>
    <DATE>2020-08-30 00:47:14</DATE>
    <TEXT>I have a funny 'fart story' I tell on occasion, concerning an incident in the Eastpoint Mall back in 1997-1999. It all centers around a store that was in the mall back then. This was a record/CD/PCgame/PS2/Video Games store that was there at the time. So, my question is this- What was the name of the store that had video games, CD's, Console Games, etc. I remember it being an incredible store with all manner of entertainment. It was near a 'crossroads' in the mall, or possibly a fountain or something. Again, this was Baltimore, Eastpoint Mall, and was NOT another chain store.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Not especially funny in print. Long story short, i had nuclear-level gas that was painful to hold inside. I would walk to a non-busy part of the mall to release it and spare everyone, but while i was in this store, I couldn't hold it any longer, and feeling immature, i snuck up behind three preteen boys engrossed in looking at games, released a large cloud, then ducked behind a 6-foot tall cabinet and listened to them go crazy when they discovred it, and began to loudly and excitedly blame each other for it for an extended period of time. It's been 20 years and I like to imagine they're still friends and still argue about culprit was to this day.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I can't believe I'm the only one on here with 'Journey- Escape' on here. I thought for sure there'd be at least a few more. I remember how much i paid for it- $5.99 at some mall sidewalk sale in Vermont. This was 1981 or 2, so i was 11 or 12. This was also the last album i bought for awhile, as everything after that was cassettes. Thriller, Synchronicity, and 2 Iron Maiden tapes. Don't Stop Believing and Open Arms were still big at the time (back when popular songs lasted more than 3 weeks), and the sci-fi cover sealed the deal for my Star Wars/B.Galactica/Buck rogers/Flash Gordon loving self.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>[More information here.]( https://www.medievalists.net/2020/01/vikings-their-filed-teeth/) The only clue we have so far is that about 80% of the cases found so far come from Gotland, the Swedish island in the Baltic Sea. This offers some suggestions that Arcini notes: One hypothesis is that the custom had its origin on the island, and that the men with filed teeth whom we find in other places than Gotland were Gotlanders who had moved from the island. If the custom if Gothlandic, according to another hypothesis, those who were not originally from Gotland could have been there to get their teeth filed; after visiting Gotland they either went home and died there or travelled on and died somewhere else, and were thus not buried on Gotland. A third possibility is that the modification of the teeth was performed in other places and that Gotland, for some reason, was a gathering point for something that the filed marks represent.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>The durable post-World War I truck chassis built by the White Motor Company of Cleveland, Ohio, was a popular pick with bus builders in the teens and twenties. This pair of distinctive-looking Seattle Municipal Railway coaches on White chassis #8217; were constructed by an unknown bus body builder. An attractive exterior finish was chosen by the Railway for the vehicles. The chassis, the hood, and fenders were likely black, the bus body was painted in two different shades, and the window frames and the door and structure were left in a natural wood finish. The circa 1919 photo of the buses waiting on Pine Street near Broadway Avenue in Seattle is courtesy of Seattle Now And Then. There you can find an interesting story with photographs covering the public transport in the City over the last century. [More Here.](https://theoldmotor.com/?p=139960)</TEXT>

Of course, ET bacame the biggest movie of the decade (just about), and was linked for YEARS with Reese's Pieces. Even now, in my 50's, when i see RP, first thing i think of is ET. I assume Reese's wanted to use ET to plug it's products, but likely couldn't afford it....so they came up with stuff like this to evoke memories of ET while it (and their candy) was still fresh in people's minds.

    <TEXT>Back in 1981 or so, Hershey's was offered a product placement deal for E.T., but turned it down (as the rumor goes). As a result, a deal was made with Reese's, using Reese's Pieces. Reeses' wold spend a million dollars helping to promote the movie, and E.T. would gobble them down. Of course, ET became the biggest movie of the decade (just about), and was linked for YEARS with Reese's Pieces. Even now, in my 50's, when i see RP, first thing i think of is ET. I'll bet you do, too. I assume Reese's wanted to use E..T to plug it's products, but likely couldn't afford it....so they came up with stuff like this to evoke memories of ET while it (and their candy) was still fresh in people's minds. I saw this one in a lot of comic book back then. This is probably the greatest product placement of all time, and put Reese's Pieces on the map.

Holton Repair (Vico Pep 88 service station), and Farmers Feed and Seed Company. Photo by Everett L. Shorty Fuller. This photo has great character with three separate businesses and all their signs. There is still a harness shop even though it is 1939. We see the owner of the service station squirting down the front street. He is still using two old circa 1925 gas pumps. And the last store advertising Purina Chows for Sheep, Cows, Poultry, and Hogs.</TEXT>

With Brian- replace the last 5 bands with Weird Al, Rush, Oingo Boingo, and IDK...Steely Dan and he's spot on. With Claires, replace Blondie  amp; Roxy Music whith whatever is on the charts at the moment. Also. Joy Division and Depressed Mode very much belong to Ally Sheedy.

    <TEXT>**New Orleans, 1978.** Queen holds a party in a New Orleans hotel to celebrate the upcoming release of their newest album, Jazz- "Not for nothing does the party become known as Saturday Night In Sodom. As they enter the hotel, guests are greeted by a troupe of hermaphrodite dwarves serving cocaine from trays strapped to their heads; the coke has been specially imported from Bolivia and quality-checked by Mercury. Fortified by  #8220;lines of marching powder as long and as thick as your grandmother #8217;s arm #8221;, the guests are free to choose from a menu of exotic diversions. The hotel ballrooms, made up to resemble labyrinthine jungle swamps, are swarming with magicians, Zulu tribesmen, contortionists, fire-eaters, drag queens and transsexual strippers. Drinks are served by naked waiters and waitresses who politely request that any tips are placed not on trays but in bodily crevices. Naked dancers cavort in bamboo cages suspended from ballroom ceilings. Nude models of both sexes wrestle in huge baths of shimmering, uncooked liver, while 300lb Samoan women lounge on banquet tables, smoking cigarettes from various orifices. As a bonus, visitors to the hotel #8217;s grand marble bathrooms are orally serviced by prostitutes of both sexes." A budget of  #163;200,000 has been decided upon, then conveniently forgotten after Mercury declares:  #8220;Fuck the cost, darlings, let us live a little. https://www.uncut.co.uk/features/queen-it-was-all-like-a-fantasy-to-see-how-far-we-could-go-18631/ https://www.ranker.com/list/queen-epic-fairmont-hotel-party/melissa-sartore https://www.interviewmagazine.com/music/obvious-history-freddie-mercurys-saturday-night-sodom</TEXT>

A new King County Courthouse was constructed on the Hill circa 1911, and Seattle lawyers caused it to become known as  #8220;Profanity Hill #8221; due to their harsh comments about the steep climb up to the courthouse.

    <TEXT>From the man on the tractor: "I followed my father into work at de Havilland, Hatfield in 1954 when I was 15. My father was the foreman in charge of the aerodrome and gardens. My job in the summer was gang-mowing the airfield and at the time of the crash in 1962 the grass had stopped growing and we were trimming round the  #8216;overshoot #8217; of the runway with a  #8216;side-mower #8217;. I stopped to talk to a chap with a camera who was walking up a ditch to the overshoot. I stopped to tell him that he shouldn #8217;t be here, I heard a roar and turned round and he took the picture! He turned out to be a friend of the pilot and had walked up the ditch to photograph his friend in the Lightning. I saw some bits fly off the plane before it crashed but it was the photographer who told me he had ejected. There was not a big explosion when it crashed, just a loud  #8216;whhooooof #8217;. I was about 200 yards from the crash scene. I saw men running out of the greenhouses and checking the scene of the crash. The works fire brigade were on the scene within a minute. Somewhere at home I have a picture of it burning. Although the picture shows it nose diving to the ground, in fact it was slowly turning over and it hit the ground upside down nose first. I was later told that if the pilot had ejected a split second later he would have ejected himself into the ground. I was very lucky. If I had known he was coming into land, I would have been positioned near the ILS (Instrument Landing System) aerial which was only 20 yards or so from the crash site! I believe the photographer had his photo restricted by the Air Ministry for  #8211; I think  #8211; about 3 months because the plane was secret. He then took it to the Daily Mail who said it was a fake. The photo was eventually published by the Daily Mirror. From there it went round the world, and I remember seeing a copy in the RAF museum at Hendon. I recollect the photographer usually photographed hunting scenes for magazines like The Field. I recollect that the pilot broke his legs but really was very lucky. I hope this is interesting. All from memory!

    <TEXT>In 1957 the MG Car Company arrived at the Bonneville Salt Flats with an unusually shaped vehicle and legendary racing driver Stirling Moss. The car was called the MG EX 181 and it was entered into the Class F land-speed series for cars with engines between 1.1 and 1.5 litres. The EX 181 #8217;s unique body was hiding a 1.5 litre twin-cam, supercharged MGA engine that had been tuned to run on 86% methanol laced with nitrobenzene, acetone and sulphuric ether. The engine produced a whopping 290hp at 7,000rpm and on the 23rd of August 1957 Stirling Moss took it up to a top speed of 245.64mph (395.31 kmh), taking the land-speed record easily over the previous record holder who held it at 203mph.

    <TEXT>The play they're going to see is The Gin Game. "The Gin Game is a two-person, two-act play by Donald L. Coburn that premiered at American Theater Arts in Hollywood in September 1976, directed by Kip Niven. It was Coburn's first play, and the theater's first production. The play won the 1978 Pulitzer Prize for Drama. Weller Martin and Fonsia Dorsey, two elderly residents at a nursing home for senior citizens, strike up an acquaintance. Neither seems to have any other friends, and they start to enjoy each other's company. Weller offers to teach Fonsia how to play gin rummy, and they begin playing a series of games that Fonsia always wins. Weller's inability to win a single hand becomes increasingly frustrating to him, while Fonsia becomes increasingly confident. While playing their games of gin, they engage in lengthy conversations about their families and their lives in the outside world. Gradually, each conversation becomes a battle, much like the ongoing gin games, as each player tries to expose the other's weaknesses, to belittle the other's life, and to humiliate the other thoroughly."</TEXT>

    <TEXT>LOL. You're not far off from the truth. A few of the sharks that have done this have actually snapped photographs in the process. The guy who took the picture writes--"Sharks are actually attracted by the electrical stimulus in the camera, so this is not uncommon. Since I discovered Tiger Beach in early 2000, 74 SLR professional cameras have been taken from my guests and myself! I don't actually keep track of how many of the much smaller gopro type cameras have been taken. My opinion of what is really happening is that these tiger sharks are just playing. Usually after taking it, several of the Tiger Sharks drop it and grab it again repeatedly! The electrical stimulus of these cameras probably attracts the sharks to the cameras and there just curious as to what it actually is. Of the 74 cameras taken we have recovered 72 of them. If you #8217;re planning on joining me on a shark dive, definitely have the camera insured as well as make it heavy so they don't keep it as long! Several of the sharks even snapped a few photos or continued filming with the video cameras stolen while recording!" [SOURCE](https://www.facebook.com/Jim-Abernethy-172830012788648/)</TEXT>

Home to immigrants and entrepreneurs, it hosted generations of families that made it. Then in the 1960s, several riots struck at the heart of the community. It hasn #8217;t recovered in the 50 years since.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Granted, much of what you see in this picture is 1950's-1960's reruns, but it was stuff that held up (and still does today- Tom  amp; Jerry, Bugs Bunny, etc.) I may be wrong, but the 1970's was a bit of a boom for Childrens programming. all those hippies from the 60's got jobs writing, producing, and drawing our shows, so we got new, original, imaginative stuff like Sigmund the Sea Monster and Schoolhouse Rock. In many ways it mirrored the 180-degree turn cinema did in the 1970's- the Boomer Generation taking over. By the mid-80's much of our TV was 30 minute commercials for GI Joe, HeMan and Thundercats, then took another 180-degree turn after Ren  amp; Stimpy. thats my 2 cents, anyways.

    <TEXT>That is the live action one- The Ghost Busters, put on by Filmation. It was on for one season in 1975, then you had the movie in 1984 (which had nothing to do with the show). Columbia pictures licensed the name for $500k and 1% of the profits (of which there were 'none' thanks to bookeeping trickery). Filmation wanted to produce Columbia's inevitable cartoon based on the show, but Columbia said no. Since Filmation still had the rights to the name Ghost Busters, they threw together a cartoon in 1986, based on the 1975 show. Of course, Columbia Pictures ALSO wanted to cash in, so they had a cartoon based on the movie, done by DiC, NOT Filmation. Since the 'Ghostbusters' name was already being used for a cartoon, they called it 'The Real Ghostbusters', later changed to 'Slimer! And the Real Ghostbusters' after a couple years. Both premiered in 1986, five days apart.</TEXT>

I grew up north of Boston, so a few of the channels look familiar.. elsewhere in the comments someone mentioned Providence and Hartford, so i am guessing it is Boston channels (4,5,  amp; 7) mixed with smaller South-of-Boston channels. Also, as another mentioned- no channel 2 (PBS!). EDIT: And if these are Boston channels, [you know whats playing in the commercials.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VA3ndE42iJA)</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Superfriends evolved a bit over the years. This was the early one, with 'comic relief' [Wendy  amp; Marvin \(and dog Dynomutt\)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rld7AqLrMfQ). They got dropped in the late 70's for the Wonder Twins, an outer space duo (and space monkey) who had powers themselves. Sometime around 1980 (??) they tried to cash in on Star Wars $$$ by setting some episodes in space. Renamed Challenge of the Superfriends, and the Legion of Evil was created, and [lived in a HQ that looked like Darth Vader's head. ](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDtMS6dWllg) It got some 'multiculteral' superheroes who were cool, A Japanese tornado guy, a Native American who grew to giant size, Black Lightning. Towards the end of it's run it added Firestorm, IIRC. Throughout it's run it was similar to Sesame Street, mixing old clips with new to keep things fresh.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Same. I was working on a tugboat in Louisiana, was the first one up and making coffee. Switched on the news, yammering about a plane hitting the WTC. Yawning and scratching my ass, I thought 'cessna, fog, dumb pilot, etc etc'. Sipping coffee when the second plane hit. I thought 'no, I guess that wasn't a cessna that hit the WTC, that was a damn jet'. WAIT A MINUTE, this is a SECOND PLANE. I Woke TF up, went around banging doors. We all sat there and watched our country getting attacked from 1500 miles away on a tugboat in South Louisiana.I'll never forget how fast we went from 'accident of the day' to a whole new world in less than an hour.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>From Wikipedia- The Maytals became one of the more popular vocal groups in Jamaica in the 1960s, recording with producers Coxsone Dodd, Prince Buster, Byron Lee, Ronnie Nasralla, and Leslie Kong. This success included winning Jamaica's National Popular Song Contest three times with songs Hibbert wrote: in 1966 with "Bam Bam", 1969 with "Sweet and Dandy" and 1972 with "Pomps  amp; Pride". In 1966, Hibbert was sentenced to 18 months in prison for possession of marijuana. This experience provided the inspiration for one of his best known songs, "54-46 That's My Number" In the winter of 1968, the cool rocksteady beat gave way to a faster, brighter, more danceable sound. Reggae was born. Toots heralded the new sound with the seminal, complex groove monster "Do the Reggay" advertising "the new dance, going around the town." Toots wanted "to do the Reggae, with you!"  #8230;From '69 to '71, Toots could do no wrong recording for Leslie Kong. With the consistent nucleus of musicians, the Beverley #8217;s All-Stars (Jackie Jackson, Winston Wright, Hux Brown, Rad Bryan, Paul Douglas and Winston Grennan) and The Maytals #8217; brilliant harmonizing, Toots wrote and sang his unmistakable voice about every subject imaginable.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>"On September 10, 2020, Conservation Officer Graham Courtney received a phone call from the US Coast Guard advising that their 175 #8217; cutter, USCGC MARCUS HANNA, was planning to be in the Piscataqua River conducting buoy maintenance. This impressive vessel is responsible for maintenance of aids to navigation, search and rescue, domestic icebreaking, and coastal security along the coast of New England. Recently, CO Courtney had reached out the USCG because we had a dilemma. Due to storms, currents, and gear abandonment, a massive entanglement of derelict lobster gear was sitting on the bottom of the Piscataqua River near its entrance to the Atlantic Ocean in Newcastle. This massive entanglement poses a threat to the river ecosystem, marine mammals, boaters, and the Piscataqua Rivers busy shipping corridor. Conservation Officers and local lobstermen had tried unsuccessfully to retrieve the gear this spring and summer, but something a bit bigger was needed. Seizing the opportunity, Conservation Officers Graham Courtney and Josiah Towne utilized the NH Fish and Game research and patrol vessel Endeavor while US Coast Guard Portsmouth Harbor Station jumped in to assist with their crew and vessel. The USCGC MARCUS HANNA hauled the mass on board, separated, and transferred it to the awaiting NHFG and USCG Portsmouth Harbor vessels on the water. It was then relayed to shore. In total, over 40 lobster traps had amassed into a large tangle of metal, rope, and gear weighing tons. Every effort will be made to identify the owners of the gear, address any violations, and properly dispose of waste. New Hampshire Fish and Game could not have accomplished this task without the assistance of the dedicated members of the US Coast Guard Portsmouth Station and USCGC MARCUS HANNA. The professional partnership of the two agencies continues to provide the public and our coastline with a safe and clean environment."</TEXT>

    <TEXT>FDNY firefighter Tim Duffy was off work the day of September 11, 2001, but when he realized what was going on, he donned his firefighter gear and rode his 2000 Super Glide Sport into lower Manhattan to help out. He made it to the base of the south tower of the World Trade Center as it began to collapse and the force of the building crashing down buried him in debris. He freed himself, only thinking of others who'd also been victims of the terrorist attack. That day he helped save people who'd been seriously injured, commandeering a truck and driving back and forth to Ground Zero to assist wherever he could. Duffy retired due to health problems from breathing in the toxic dust, and now helps first responders and veterans with PTSD through the organization he founded, 1 Soldier 1 Dog 1 Team.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Black bears are the smallest and most abundant bears in North America. They have a reputation for being skittish and easy to scare away, and while that might apply to most black bears, it is glaringly obvious that it does not apply to all of them. Black bear attacks are not as common as grizzly attacks, but their close proximity to human-populated areas is still cause for concern. At the moment, there are 1.25 fatal black bear attacks each year for the entire continent. Even with this very slim chance, black bears should still be given a wide berth when encountered.Luckily, this experience ended with nothing more than a bruised elbow and an incredible video.

    <TEXT>From Wiki:The station that now broadcasts from 690 AM in Birmingham signed on in 1947 as WVOK. It was the first radio station in Birmingham to broadcast with 50,000 watts. Due to Federal Communications Commission restrictions, the station broadcast only during daytime hours. It was not until the early 1980s that WVOK was able to broadcast 24 hours a day. 690 AM is a Canadian and Mexican clear-channel frequency. Throughout the 1960s and into the 1970s, WVOK was a Top 40 station calling itself  #8220;The Mighty 690" with a signal that covered almost all of north and central Alabama, as well as parts of Mississippi, Georgia and Tennessee. Rather than attempting to compete with crosstown station (and market leader) WSGN, WVOK targeted listeners in the rural areas of the states its signal reached. One of the most popular promotions of WVOK was their  #8220;Shower of Stars #8221; concert series. Throughout the 1960s and 1970s, these concerts brought such performers as the Rolling Stones, Jerry Lee Lewis, Neil Diamond and the Beach Boys to Birmingham. In 1976, WVOK dropped Top 40 music and became a country station using the nickname OK 69. At about the same time, sister station WVOK-FM (now WZRR) signed on with an album rock format. Country music on WVOK continued until 1985, when the station changed to adult contemporary music before moving to an oldies format. In 1989, oldies were dropped, and the station began playing classic country music. During the late 1980s and early 1990s, several AM stations in Birmingham debuted afternoon sports talk call-in shows. Local sportswriter Paul Finebaum had debuted a popular show on WAPI. In 1990, Herb Winches, a former TV sports anchor on WBRC and WVTM, moved his own popular show with co-host Ben Cook from WERC to WVOK. Because Winches #8217; show was fairly successful, and because, by the 1990s, there were few AM radio stations that were successful playing music, station management made the decision to launch an all-sports station in 1992.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I wasn't sure if it was true or not, so Googled it. Found several sources, but here's MeatEater.com- Claim Young rattlesnakes have the worst bites because they can #8217;t control the amount of venom they inject. Adult rattlesnakes, on the other hand, have the foresight to leave something in their reserve for later. After all, a wise rattler knows that no venom now means no food later. Origin The origins of this theory are unclear, but it #8217;s a widespread belief. MeatEater editors from California, to South Dakota, to Pennsylvania said this is an accepted rule in their region. Maybe the same folks who started the rumor that daddy longlegs are venomous came up with this one, too. Facts Both young and old rattlesnakes can control the amount of venom they throw in a given strike, and studies show that age isn #8217;t an indicator for probability of a  #8220;dry #8221; bite. This means that a 1-foot rattlesnake is just as likely as a 5-foot rattlesnake to deliver a bite with no venom. Even if a baby rattler gives everything it has, there isn #8217;t much for it to give.  #8220;Bigger snakes have much bigger venom sacs, and adults can deliver far greater volumes of venom than babies, even if they only inject a small percentage of the total volume available, #8221; said Greg Pauly, a herpetologist at the Natural History Museum of Los Angeles County, in an interview with Bay Nature magazine. As far as claims that young rattlers have more potent venom, there #8217;s a bit of truth to that. Rattlesnake venom contains over 100 different active components, and the makeup of a specific snake #8217;s venom is determined by age, diet, geographic location, how long ago the snake ate, and other factors. While experts believe that younger snakes tend to have quicker acting venom, it #8217;s not enough to outweigh their small supplies.  #8220;It could be argued that the drop-for-drop potency of baby rattlesnake venom is greater, but here is where the issue of venom quantity comes into play, #8221; according to an Animal Behaviour study.  #8220;An adult rattlesnake produces, stores, and injects anywhere form 20-50x more venom.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I once went to a resort with a 'mini-zoo' attached to it in Ghana, West Africa. We were a missionary-group and there were quite a few middle-aged ladies with us. At the zoo, There was a 20' x 20' cage with a half dozen monkeys in it, and agama lizards running all over the place. they'd dart in and out of the cages, grabbing the seeds and dropping from the food the monkeys were eating. We watched an agama get a little too brave and go for a meal a little too close to the center of the cage. a monkey started after him, and leapt over the agama blocking his exit through the bars. Lightning-fast, he scooped up the lizard and began eating him alive, starting at the tail. The agama immediately froze and stretched out his limbs and opened his eye real wide. He was like that the entire time, as the monkey ate him like a damn burrito, tail all the way down to the head. the older ladies with us screamed and gasped and clutched their pearls, while us young types were just leered and smiled and said, "Wow, this is amazing!"</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I never ate 'lizard', but have eaten Iguana in Curacao. It was skinned and roasted in some sort of curry sauce. It didn't taste especially fantastic, had a bit of a gamey taste. Of course, on the way to the restaurant (and all over Curacao, really) you'll pass about 100 roadkill iguanas, so I couldn't help but wonder where the restaurant got their meat from.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>i do this, and will also call their 800 number and ~~request~~ demand to be removed from their mailing list. Both have worked out well for me. To top it off, i have a mail lady who know i work out to sea and am gone for months at a time, so she doesn't give me any ad flyers either. i thank her by getting her a Starbucks gift card whenever i come home. It's nice to live in a small town sometimes.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Hell yes, they're edible. I worked for the gov't on an island that was absolutely teeming with them. Messing with local wildlife was a fast way to get kicked off the island and lose your job, but if you slipped a local workers $20 they'd get one for you. I did it one time, cooked it late at night when everyone onboard was asleep, and it was fairly delicious. Not as good as Maine lobster, but very good.</TEXT>

To buy tools, you had two choices: * buy brand-new Chinese stuff in the store, or * buy the old tools Americans/Europeans 'threw away' at the street markets. It was no contest. A mechanic friend bought a new wrench for $5 dollars, It didn't last a day. And $5 is an average daily wage in Liberia or Sierra Leone. I got no love for cheap Chinese-made garbage.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Correct. I had one removed some years back, took about 4-5 sessions. It hurt worse than the tattoo ever did and cost about $2000 get removed. Pretty expensive for a free tattoo.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Haha, no- it was at Kagan's a few doors down. The Abbey was where the 'upper-scale' gutter punks drank, if you can believe that. Kagans was the bottom of the barrel, but was always a good time. It is gone now, but exists in memory (and a brief scene in The Pelican Brief). Whenever I'm back in NOLA, I always have a drink or two at the Abbey, for old times sake. They still have that one customers ashes in an urn behind the bar?</TEXT>

I stopped going around the mid-90's. Towards the end of my tenure they'd hired a NOPD officer to hang out there all night in uniform. I guess things got too wild.

There was a giant iguana thatt lived on the base and would hang out on the pier. A big bastard, 6-7 feet long. The SEAL's would have an initiation where the 'new guys' were tasked with capturing the iguana. A few of them managed to actually do it, Iguanas can only spend about 5-10 minutes underwater, so it they'd have to keep chasing it until it surfaced.</TEXT>

    <TEXT> gt; I'm no biologist, but I'm 100% certain this eel didn't suffocate, but rather the venom of the pufferfish is what killed it. Eels have gills therefore don't breath theough their mouth. [Most fish species have bony gill covers on their sides which they constantly open and close to force water over the internal gill chamber allowing them to breathe. Moray eels do not have these covers so they have to use their mouths to orally pump water through the gills.](https://murexdive.com/moray-eels-facts/#:~:text=Most%20fish%20species%20have%20bony,pump%20water%20through%20the%20gills.)</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I went shark diving in the Bahamas a few years back. Those are harmless reef sharks and won't attack humans...the dive master literally brought a couple of bagged loaves of bread to feed them with. However on one of the dives, a largish fish was attracted to the commotion and swam over. the sharks immediately left us and began chasing after the fish, who ducked under a giant truck-sized rock. He was safe from the sharks, but the way they circled that rock waiting for him to come out was unsettling for me, who had no rock to hide under.</TEXT>

As soon as he opened the bags, the bread turned into a sort of gooey watery mess that he scooped and 'threw'. the sharks would swoop in and take a bite of it.

It was a commercial for Rolling Stone and featured Richard Marx in a leather jacket and that shitty Aqua Net mullet of his talking about 'The Spirit of Rock and Roll'. When Boyz2Men/Vanilla Ice were topping the charts and Richard Marx was lecturing you about Rock and roll, you clearly understood that the Alt explosion of the early 90's was inevitable.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>It was an amazing, groundbreaking video. The whole album was amazing,...but TBH, the emotional Hat Trick of Red Rain, Don't give Up, and In Your Eyes (paging Lloyd Dobler) makes Sledgehammer one of the weaker songs on the release. I honestly doubt I'd thought about it much in the past 34 years, until Harry Styles (of One Direction) covered it on the Stern show a few months back. With a completely different mix, focusing on the Bass  amp; Drum (and the drummer from Hot Chip in her robert Palmer t), it makes it sound soulful and (believe it or not) better than the original. This is one of those songs I never thought needed a remake. Anyways, if you thought Sledgehammer was fine as it is, [check this out.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tqm7-zN5s8k)</TEXT>

    <TEXT>[From Christie's Auction Site-](https://www.christies.com/lotfinder/Lot/nellybelle-5338180-details.aspx) NELLYBELLE One of the most memorable characters on the Roy Rogers TV show that ran from 1951 through 1957 was neither Roy, Dale, Trigger, Buttermilk or even Bullet - or for that matter even made of flesh and blood. It was a TV icon manufactured from good old American steel and named Nellybelle, a 1946 Willys CJ-2A Jeep with some very innovative bodywork. It was in fact owned by Roy, but was driven in the show by his comic sidekick, Pat Brady (1914-1972). Brady met Rogers while appearing as a bass guitarist in California in 1935, striking up a friendship with the young country  amp; western singer who was a member of the popular group, The Sons of the Pioneers. When Len Slye was elevated to screen stardom as Roy Rogers, he recommended Brady as his replacement. However, as Bob Nolan, an original member of The Sons, was referred to as Bob, "Bob Brady" became "Pat Brady" joining the legendary singing group and appearing in a dozen films between 1938-51, including West of Cheyenne (1938), Man from Sundown (1939), The Durango Kid (1940), Song of Texas (1943), Bells of Coronado (1950), and South of Caliente (1951).</TEXT>
