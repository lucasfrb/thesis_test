    <TEXT>I #8217;ve had several therapy sessions, listened to all the advice people (including my parents who I am extremely close to) gave me on countless occasions. No matter how much sense everyone makes in those moments, or how many sessions I have, I always end up hurting myself. I think I #8217;m truly addicted to it; I feel like if I don #8217;t, I won #8217;t feel better. Sometimes I do it impulsively and I don #8217;t even think before I do it. I think I #8217;m addicted to not just to specifically harming/hurting myself but my misery in general. Is that a real thing or am I just out of my fucking mind?  #128514;</TEXT>

    <TITLE>What #8217;s wrong with me?</TITLE>
    <DATE>2020-06-09 04:07:42</DATE>
    <TEXT>I #8217;m an 18 year old male and I haven #8217;t lost my virginity yet. I feel deeply ashamed about it because everyone I talk to isn #8217;t a virgin; I could have lost it before but for some reason I just chose not to. I #8217;m not and have never been as sexually active as my peers which causes me to feel like an outcast and that something is wrong with me. In a past relationship, I naturally froze and was very awkward in sexual situations and it just stuck with me. Literally all the people I know and talk to are just better than me with this type of stuff (flirting and sexual shit  #129335; #8205; #9794; #65039;). Simply put: I got no game, I #8217;m pathetic and ready to give up because at the rate I #8217;m going at, I #8217;ll die a virgin. Just hope that either someone can relate to this or help me figure out what #8217;s wrong with me.</TEXT>

    <TITLE>Finally</TITLE>
    <DATE>2020-06-12 04:58:45</DATE>
    <TEXT>I went to the hospital after I tried to cut my wrists. I missed my veins several times and eventually gave up. I was walking around with a cut up arm and tried to end my own life; this is when I realized something was wrong and I need help. Upon hindsight, I was extremely naive to do this but I showed my arm to my school councilor. He was the only one at school I trusted with this type of information. Like anyone else in his position would have done, he followed protocol and called the ambulance. I was taken to the hospital and to the  #8220;psych-ward #8221; part of the hospital. I think it was there when I was diagnosed. Ever since I have been seeing my therapist regularly. For a while after seeing my therapist, I was starting to question if the constant self harm, self-loathing and unhappiness was a result of some type of chemical imbalance (something that I #8217;m not controlling/can #8217;t control). I wondered if this was the case because all the conversations I have had with her and my amazing parents were and still are never enough to keep me from walking around either mad at myself, or randomly sad and empty. Being unhappy, negative and hurting myself has been natural to me since at least 5th grade (I #8217;m going to college now). I recently asked my therapist what I was diagnosed with in an effort to prove to myself if my actions and mood are a result of what my brain does on its own or not. Turns out I have major depressive disorder (clinical depression). Everything finally makes sense now and it kind of takes a weight of my chest; for so long, I #8217;ve been asking myself  #8220;what #8217;s wrong with you? #8221; But now I know and it makes even more sense as to why I #8217;m so attracted to negativity and why I take SO much comfort in my suffering. I #8217;m honestly just glad that I finally have an answer. That doesn #8217;t mean my problems are going anywhere but I at least know what #8217;s going on. I might get medicated and treat it like I do with my ADHD but I will think more about it before I make a decision.</TEXT>

Despite these successes, I haven #8217;t felt any joy from it and have actually been feeling little joy from anything. I #8217;m not unhappy but I just feel empty; I don #8217;t even feel joy from making music. Why am I so empty all of a sudden?</TEXT>

At the same time, I haven #8217;t felt any better mentally or towards myself in general. Now I just feel like if I want to kill myself again then I have to go all out and be sure that what I #8217;m doing would kill anyone 9/10 times. I see what you mean thought; it makes sense.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Wow. I actually take Adderall for my ADD. I don #8217;t know about you but I honestly hate taking it and only take it when I absolutely have to. When I take it, I feel like a zombie. When I take them, waking up in the morning at any time is MUCH easier, there #8217;s a nice, tiny boost in mood for 10 minutes, and concentrating is MUCH easier. However, when all my work is done, I would walk around feeling absolutely dead. I would feel empty and like a zombie.</TEXT>

She seems very sensitive and respectful of your lack of experience and is willing to go at your pace. Don #8217;t feel insecure about not knowing things because that #8217;s what this meeting is for. It may be a little embarrassing but it #8217;ll only be as bad as you make it. The #1 advice I #8217;d tell you is to do your absolute best to relax. Above anything else, be honest with yourself and think about if this is something you really wanna follow through with. I #8217;m honestly a little jealous of you #128514; if I were you, I #8217;d take the offer but don #8217;t ever be pressured to do something you don #8217;t want to do.</TEXT>

I #8217;m in a constant state of loneliness; people do their best to help but I always feel this persistent loneliness. Idk what else to do but live in it. I accept it</TEXT>

    <TITLE>[18M] Thinking about losing my virginity to my best friend (who  #8216;s a girl)</TITLE>
    <DATE>2020-07-14 14:14:25</DATE>
    <TEXT>There #8217;s this girl who #8217;s been my best friend for almost 2 years. We #8217;re the same age but she #8217;s a rising sophomore in college, while I #8217;m a rising freshmen in college. I #8217;m not REALLY attracted to her, but she #8217;s definitely not ugly. I feel like she used to have a crush on me which makes me feel like I got a better chance. She lost her virginity before I did and when she told me about her experience as a freshmen in college, that #8217;s the first time I felt self conscious about still being a virgin. I feel like if there #8217;s anyone I know who might be willing to help me lose my virginity, it #8217;d be her; I never asked or brought it up yet but I #8217;m still thinking about it. Should I go for it?</TEXT>

Here #8217;s my advice, so you don #8217;t have to experience that. Let out your emotions by yourself. The next time you feel anything, experience it completely when no ones watching.</TEXT>

You don #8217;t need to be in a straight up relationship to engage in sex or anything of the sorts with someone. 3. You #8217;re already at a really good place because you recognize you #8217;re reasons for not being sexually active like that. In my opinion, you #8217;re reasons are solid and I suggest you continue to do what you #8217;re doing 4. You #8217;re at a really good place right now. Don #8217;t rush into it and if you end up having sex I highly HIGHLY suggest you wear a condom.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I #8217;m in the same boat. Idk if this helps but this advice helped me. Someone who lost their virginity said it was embarrassing but after that moment, you feel much better (like a weight was lifted off yourself). You may or may not embarrass yourself, but I suggest accepting it as a real possibility. Not having any game is really tuff when you #8217;re trying to hook up with girls. It #8217;s like tryna win a race without any wheels; you might have good things going for you like, a great engine, brakes etc. But there #8217;s nothing that really takes you anywhere if that makes any sense  #128514; #129335; #8205; #9794; #65039;</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I #8217;m on quite a few subs that involve depression and other communities that provide a place for people who have poor mental health to interact. I saw people post their  #8220;suicide note #8221; in those communities and lots of people respond basically saying  #8220;I #8217;ve been there, it gets better #8221; so-on-and-so-forth. However, most of the people that respond that way are as miserable or down bad as the person they #8217;re trying to save. I personally don #8217;t feel like you can save someone when you can #8217;t save yourself and that #8217;s why I try not to reach out to anyone or talk. I #8217;m not trying to speak ill of the people who try to help, but I can #8217;t help but feel that we #8217;re all depressed people, telling each other to cheer up. I can #8217;t be saved and I #8217;ve given up on saving myself so maybe that #8217;s why I have this outlook but...idk, shoutout to all those trying to help your fellow human.

I #8217;ve been blessed with the most amazing parents in the world (unfortunately) so they #8217;ve been making sure I get better. I could lie about it, but that #8217;s not fair to them so I don #8217;t. I do as I #8217;m told. I #8217;m actually gonna start with DBT soon. My psychiatrist feels it #8217;s be better suited for me than my current type of therapy cuz these thoughts (which manifest into physical action) are compulsive, according to my psychiatrist.</TEXT>

    <DATE>2020-08-20 15:55:22</DATE>
    <TEXT>There #8217;s 2 main problems that have plagued me my whole life: being a  #8220;nice guy #8221; and my depression. When I say  #8220;nice guy #8221; I don #8217;t mean it in that  #8220;girls only like assholes #8221; type of way. I mean that, I know being nice is appreciated but if that #8217;s ALL you have to offer, it #8217;s over. That #8217;s boring. I #8217;m not really funny, charismatic, charming or anything like that. I #8217;m boring. Now, when it comes to my depression, I hold it responsible for only being able to attract crazy girls or girls who #8217;re also mentally fucked up. I #8217;m persistently sad and angry at myself, but I don #8217;t have any motivation to change it. This post is my way of saying that I accept that this mental state I #8217;m trapped in (and don #8217;t want to escape from) will ensure I #8217;ll always be alone and never meet the girl of my dreams. But I #8217;m okay with it cuz that #8217;s what happens when you #8217;re a sad sack of shit like me. In a way, it feels right and feels like I #8217;m getting what I deserve. #129335; #8205; #9794; #65039; #129318; #8205; #9794; #65039;</TEXT>

    <TEXT>It #8217;s happened in the past; I thought my ex #8217;s were angels just because they were nicer to me than expected. In actuality, they were demonstrating BASIC kindness. They were actually very toxic and in some ways, cruel to me; it was in ways I couldn #8217;t see, I was so blinded by my feelings. I felt grateful and lucky that they liked me (they said they loved me) so I would put up with some of the cruelty because I thought I couldn #8217;t do better.

    <TEXT>I feel you. Tinder is a HOOKUP APP, ion give a fuck what no one says. You #8217;re right tho, there #8217;s a bigger emphasis on hooking up rather than serious relationship. As a guy who used to REALLY try to pursue serious relationships, boys and girls made fun of me for it. But I also think it #8217;s an age thing and that makes more sense of It to me. People just wanna whore it up when they #8217;re young and settle down when they get older. At this age (I #8217;m 18 btw), we will struggle to find what we #8217;re looking for but it #8217;s not impossible; it #8217;s just a lot harder.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Sounds to me like yall are experiencing this relationship differently. Based off what you said, it sounds like she doesn #8217;t really want a serious relationship and I just looking for someone to hookup with. All I can say is that if you really don #8217;t wanna do anything, don #8217;t do it and don #8217;t let someone pressure you into it. If you #8217;re just really nervous about it, I suggest either being honest with her and tell her that you #8217;re just a little nervous about it. If she knows you #8217;re a virgin, and she #8217;s not an asshole, she #8217;ll understand and not make you feel bad about it. Now, if you don #8217;t wanna tell her you #8217;re nervous and you wanna play it off, do that then.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I mean, first off, we were in high school and it was a long time ago so I #8217;m not really hurt from it no more. But, we were dating; we said that we loved each other and it felt genuine to me. I can #8217;t say the same for her, but I wouldn #8217;t be surprised if she meant it when she said she loved me . Anyway, I found out after she broke up with me that she was sending naked pictures and videos to some of my classmates. I saw the pictures and videos. What hurt the most about it was that when we were dating, she randomly asked me what I #8217;d do if she did those things. I told her that I #8217;d be more sad than mad and that it #8217;d hurt me a lot  #128514; did that count as cheating?</TEXT>

People used to call me an Oreo and said I had  #8220;white #8221; hair or  #8220;good hair #8221;. A good amount of the stupid shit I would hear came from family who always made me feel insecure about it and friends worsened it. As far how you feel about your skin tone, it #8217;s deliberate. You #8217;ve been fed subliminal messages your whole life that dark-skinned,  #8220;nappy headed #8221; people are less than, ugly and undesirable. People will try n tell you that everyone deals with this (all races) or something and just know that it #8217;s bullshit. You #8217;ve been conditioned to feel this way. You #8217;ve been conditioned that lighter skin tone (closest skin tone to being white) is better. Anyone who makes you feel inadequate and insecure about your skin tone is part of that conditioning. Don #8217;t listen to them</TEXT>

    <TEXT>18M I #8217;m still a virgin for quite a few reasons but I #8217;m not exactly too sure how to explain them. Reason No.1 I have horrible self esteem and sense of self worth. I feel that this has and is sabotaging my ability to meet new girls. Every time I see a pretty girl, I IMMEDIATELY think  #8220;she wants nothing to do wit me #8221;  #8220;she wouldn #8217;t be caught dead with a loser like you #8221; etc. So I don #8217;t even shoot my shots anymore. Another reason is that I don #8217;t really have a high interest in sex. It #8217;s been like that for YEARS; in the past, I #8217;ve had a couple opportunities to lose my virginity but didn #8217;t. I just never really wanted to; sex isn #8217;t really that important to me. If I #8217;m horny, I #8217;ll just jack off; I just don #8217;t have that drive that all my friends have. The main reason that I can give the most credit to is my depression. It has consumed me and when I decide to even TRY and get a handle on it; till then, I #8217;ll be a lonely virgin</TEXT>

I feel like anyone who says they have any kind of love for me is full of shit (to a certain level). I just hate myself so so so so so much. I hate myself more than I love anyone or anything. However, I do my utmost best to be respectful, and positive to other people. But I give myself the total opposite and on the highest level.

    <TEXT>Well, if you got this person wanting to have sex with you, you #8217;ve done the right things. So as far as them not liking how you look naked, they would prolly wanna see you naked if they wanna have sex with you. When it comes to being good enough, it #8217;s only fair to expect that you won #8217;t be as good as someone who #8217;s experienced. If I were you, I would mentally brace myself for the possibility of not doing well. It #8217;s likely to happen but not a certainty. If they leave because of how bad you are, fuck it. You lost your virginity so now it #8217;s time to practice. This is just my opinion, I hope this helps in any kind of way.</TEXT>

However I #8217;m inclined to disagree that I #8217;m unlucky. I could have it a whole lot worse, but my therapist and psychologist have figured that there is a chemical imbalance. I #8217;ve been prescribed 2 different kinds of antidepressants but I don #8217;t wanna take em. The 1st time I took Zoloft, it was doin exactly what it was supposed to do, and it was working. So, that #8217;s why I stopped taking it. Same does for this new one, Wellbutrin. I just don #8217;t wanna get better, be happy, etc. I #8217;m not interested.

    <TEXT>I wouldn #8217;t say that I watch too much porn. I used to work out and box. Maybe it is a depression because I don #8217;t really have motivation to do anything exactly. Not to go outside, making music (which I used to do a lot). I #8217;m not sure if I have a low sex drive but that might be it. Thanks for your insight</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Tbh, the 2 MAIN reasons are low self esteem and introversion. So my 2 reasons are confidence issues and social skills issues. I must say tho, that it #8217;s more of the former than the latter</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Oh, it #8217;s nothing really glorious or anything at all. I was tryna slit my wrists. Like a fuckin dumb-ass, I missed my veins and I wasn #8217;t going deep enough. I was missing and was cutting shallowly cuz I was scared; I didn #8217;t wanna sever a nerve and never be able to use my hand/arm again. When I decided to go even deeper, my hand started twitching as I was moving the knife across my arm. I got too scared to continue so I gave up. I still regret it, not that I tired to kill myself, but I regret not succeeding.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I get SUPER uncomfortable and embarrassed when talking about my persistant unhappiness, self hatred, and self harm. I really cringe when people label what I go through as depression but the most embarrassing topic is my self harm. I can #8217;t figure out why I get so embarrassed. For the record, I can go into great detail about my mental state on the internet but, I #8217;d never be able to say half the shit I say on here to another person.</TEXT>
