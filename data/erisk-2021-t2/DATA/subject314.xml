    <TEXT>Depending on who you ask and interact with. Almost all South Koreans are not ok with that apology or that pitifully small reparations for what the Japanese army did to these women. The Japanese representatives did not do an in-person apology to the comfort women/victims - this is one of the victims #8217; demand. The Japanese government also refuse to acknowledge that pimping out these innocent women to the Japanese army was a crime and therefore, they declared no legal responsibilities. There is a reason why the current South Korean president demand an apology for a reason. President Moon agrees with his constituents and deems the original apology as insufficient. The South Korean government also find the reparation amount laughable ($8.8 millions) and is more than ready to match that amount. Also, just to noted, the past South Korean president who accepted that apology had been impeached and imprisoned for corruption. A lot of her decisions and ruling are unpopular among South Koreans. At the time of the apology, many South Koreans had urged her to not accept it bc even they knew it was insulting for the Japanese government to downplay the pain of comfort women like that. Also, a Korean [redditor](https://reddit.com/r/TikTokCringe/comments/im06nx/_/g3yd4vp/?context=1) had commented on this. Japanese schools are definitely not fleshing out the details about comfort women. They are leaving out a lot of details surrounding forced sterilization/womb removal, recruitment methods, intimidation methods, suicides, stigma, ...  gt; Most Korean people couldnt care less about the money. We want an actual apology by way of teaching their younger generations what they did and how it was wrong. I have spoken to some Japanese people around my age who had no idea what I was talking about. That is not an apology, it is a way too avoid accepting their actions.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Yes! As an Asian, I would never support other Asians who would oppress their own people to line their own pocket and further their careers. Donnie Yen is pro-CCP too. Im never watching Ip Man or anything he starring in again. Even worse, the lead actress for Mulan (Liu Yifei) is a US citizen. How are you a US citizen but advocate for pro-democracy Hong Kong protestors to be beaten and jailed by the police? They are just fighting to have the same rights she enjoys as a US citizen (free speech and voting rights). She is literally the biggest hypocrite I ever met. Not to mention, the movie crew and writers are all white. The voiceover was done by white voice actors. This movie is a pure cash grab and not the Asian representation I would want. Anyway, #MilkTeaAlliance</TEXT>

    <TEXT>You should add Donnie Yen in an edit. He is the lead actor of this Mulan movie and the titular character in the IP Man series. He is also pro-CCP despite growing up in the United States. For what it worths, he relinquished his US citizenship for a Chinese one so at least he stands behind his statement. That is somehow more understandable (not saying it is right). Liu Yifei, on the other hand, still has her US citizenship while endorsing a communist government #8217;s effort in wiping out pro-democracy protests. That is fucking crazy.  gt; Early last year, Yen issued a statement declaring that  #8220;at no time, no place, and in no way can the motherland be violated. #8221; Well, "motherland" happens to be a term often invoked by Beijing to reject dissent from those such as the protesters in Hong Kong, who criticize its authoritarian rule. - [Source](https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/opinion/martial-arts-superstars-and-radical-hong-kong-protesters-fall-short-in-historic-moment)</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Chris Brown #8217;s police report from when he assaulted Rihanna: A verbal argument ensued and Chris Brown pulled the vehicle over on an unknown street, reached over Robyn F. with his right hand, opened the car door and attempted to force her out. Brown was unable to force Robyn F. out of the vehicle because she was wearing a seat belt. When he could not force her to exit, he took his right hand and shoved her head against he passenger window of the vehicle, causing an approximate one-inch raised circular contusion. Robyn F. turned to face Brown and he punched her in the left eye with his right hand. He then drove away in the vehicle and continued to punch her in the face with his right hand while steering the vehicle with his left hand. The assault caused Robyn F.'s mouth to fill with blood and blood to splatter all over her clothing and the interior of the vehicle. Brown looked at Robyn F. and stated, 'I'm going to beat the shit out of you when we get home! You wait and see!' The detective said Robyn F. then used her cell phone to call her personal assistant Jennifer Rosales, who did not answer. Robyn F. pretended to talk to her and stated, 'I'm on my way home. Make sure the police are there when I get there.' After Robyn F. faked the call, Brown looked at her and stated, 'You just did the stupidest thing ever! Now I'm really going to kill you!' Brown resumed punching Robyn F. and she interlocked her fingers behind her head and brought her elbows forward to protect her face. She then bent over at the waist, placing her elbows and face near her lap in [an] attempt to protect her face and head from the barrage of punches being levied upon her by Brown. Brown continued to punch Robyn F. on her left arm and hand, causing her to suffer a contusion on her left triceps (sic) that was approximately two inches in diameter and numerous contusions on her left hand. Robyn F. then attempted to send a text message to her other personal assistant, Melissa Ford. Brown snatched the cellular telephone out of her hand and threw it out of the window onto an unknown street. Brown continued driving and Robyn F. observed his cellular telephone sitting in his lap. She picked up the cellular telephone with her left hand and before she could make a call he placed her in a head lock with his right hand and continued to drive the vehicle with his left hand. Brown pulled Robyn F. close to him and bit her on her left ear. She was able to feel the vehicle swerving from right to left as Brown sped away. He stopped the vehicle in front of 333 North June Street and Robyn F. turned off the car, removed the key from the ignition and sat on it. Brown did not know what she did with the key and began punching her in the face and arms. He then placed her in a head lock positioning the front of her throat between his bicep and forearm. Brown began applying pressure to Robyn F.'s left and right carotid arteries, causing her to be unable to breathe and she began to lose consciousness. She reached up with her left hand and began attempting to gouge his eyes in an attempt to free herself. Brown bit her left ring and middle fingers and then released her. While Brown continued to punch her, she turned around and placed her back against the passenger door. She brought her knees to her chest, placed her feet against Brown's body and began pushing him away. Brown continued to punch her on the legs and feet, causing several contusions. Robyn F. began screaming for help and Brown exited the vehicle and walked away. A resident in the neighborhood heard Robyn F.'s plea for help and called 911, causing a police response. An investigation was conducted and Robyn F. was issued a Domestic Violence Emergency Protective Order.</TEXT>

    <TEXT> gt; Literally rushing to scene to collect fragments is strange, idc. It seems very opportunistic to immediately launch a jewelry line, and something done for charity can still be a PR move. It seems like the gimmick came first and the logistics were left for later. The main focus should never be on allies, and they were conducting interviews about the setup of their business. Who are they doing this for? I don #8217;t think this truly raises awareness beyond the sale of a morbid conversation piece I didn #8217;t realize this. Yeah, the entire focus is on them. I just realize even if they don #8217;t profited monetarily, the exposure will be super beneficial for them.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Girl, you speak the truth here and addressed a lot of excuses being made for Liu Yifen. It is driving me up the wall to see her promoting police brutality toward pro-democracy protestors while being a US citizen. People who are making excuses for her like  #8220;oh she might get imprisoned #8221; or  #8220;oh she might get her family in trouble #8221; don #8217;t understand Chinese celeb culture at all. Hardly no celebrities had gotten in trouble with the government (except for Fan Bing Bing but she also embezzled $183 millions soooo). If a Chinese celeb is being especially aside from the  #8220;one China #8221; and the flag tweet, something is definitely up. The same argument can be made for Jackson Wang but no one in r/kpop and UKO wanna hear it lmaoo.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Updates so far: (7/10/2020) Feeding America Head of Corporate Partnerships person and that person doesn #8217;t know what Zazaworld is. They also said there is no contract between Zazaworld and Feeding America. No donation had been made to Feeding America. ([link](https://vm.tiktok.com/ZMJAVrTEW/)) (7/14/2020) Feeding America is now stating that someone is working with Zazaworld but no donations had been made but  #8220;[Zazaworld] do have a date to send it by #8221;. Since is it a private contract, no further info is given. ([link](https://vm.tiktok.com/ZMJAVy3Ey/)) The money is taking a while to get to Feedingn America. From reading the tiktok comments, what the commenters think is happening is that the money is sitting in an interest generating account. Zazaworld will only donate after they make some money from it/ pay themselves. Idk if this is legal in the US. If someone know, please let me know.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Yeah other Karen videos, you can clearly see they were left alone most of the time. I mean obviously dealing with a Karen is frustrating, but to hit them with a cart AND physically assault them is something else. Not to mention, the guy who hit her is absolutely massive. He was not in any real danger and she did not attack him directly. He has no skin in this game.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>You #8217;re right lol but some people dont wanna hear it. More often than not, manga as a whole has reallllllllllly questionable depictions of women and underage girls (physical or personality wise). Women in almost all manga are only there to fulfill some kinda fan-service or play the foil/support to the male lead. Not to mention, manga is created to aim toward younger (mostly male) audience and that is their introduction to women. It is not a stretch to say that a lot people will read it and think girls are suppose to look like this or act a certain way. It is different from Baki who is a bodybuilder by the time he was 15. His mom make him train at 3 and he fight in an underground fighting ring. Even a dumbass will know that whole manga is unrealistic. Tbh, I wouldnt find anything wrong with it if boobs are drawn in the right proportion or exaggerated a little. However, they always look kinda stuck on, bigger than a melon, and move very weirdly (boob physics). Whereas depiction of muscles are more faithful to real life, female physical attributions like boobs are not. Keep in mind that Japanese girls are under pressure to conform to harsher beauty and body standard by a patriarchal society. They are judged for it starting at a young age till they die essentially. Continuous exposure to unrealistic images and proportion like this either (1) fuck up how they perceive themselves or (2) put more pressure on them to behave and look a certain way. Therefore, it is not surprise why some women was begging this authors to stop drawing women this way bc it is (1) setting an impossible standard, (2) it unnecessarily objectify women (seriously a manga does not need to have a pinup girl on every cover to lure fans), (3) it is not drawn even close to being realistic, and (4) it is just plain uncomfortable to look at.</TEXT>

Band cultures are doing great there too. Idol culture will hopefully be a thing of the past. It is super stifling and toxic for everyone involve.

    <TEXT>This is not new lmaoo idol culture killed all creativity. Idols now are fairly-good to subpar technical dancers but reallllly shit the bag when it come to doing something else that isn #8217;t quite as heavilty choreographed. To make it worse, (idk if this is a 4th gen thing) a lot of people in the group cant sing. Like they cant sing. Coupled with the facts that a lot of groups now are boring as hell on variety shows (they only dance), i can say with full confidence that 4th idol groups is gonna be the downfall of kpop. Idols nowaday join companies to get rich not because they like dancing and singing. It #8217;s not like they have a passion for it either. Now every pretty faces want to debut as an idol and make it like BTS and once in a while, a company might get lucked out that one of these trainees can sing or dance. This is why I only listen to non-kpop artists now.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I don #8217;t want to make assumptions about someone #8217;s sexuality but the timing is kinda sus if you think about it. Not to mention, if she is actually a member of the lgbtq community like she had identified, wouldn #8217;t it make the aggravated assault worse? She, out of all people, should not how hard it is to exist and work as a trans individual. Just because she identify as LGBTQ+, it does NOT minimize the pain she inflicted on Finley but I can see how this can play to her advantage in court. There is no updates so far, everything is being sweep under the rug. Tbh, if I was Finley, it would be a hard case even with all the evidences. Think about it, you are going against a senator/presidential candidate + A-list celeb couple. Both has a lot of power, connections to the court/legal system, exposure, and money to entirely ruin your life.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>No one notice this but when they laughed at  #8220;Vietnamese #8221;, it actually hurt a lot. I been saying this but aside from being anti-black, East Asian in generally look down on South and South East Asian. Whenever they see a person being too tanned or too ugly - so anyone outside of their beauty standard - they said  #8220;oh you look like a south/south east asian #8221;. It doesn #8217;t happen often but enough for me and other south east asians and south asians to notice. This is especially rich bc East Asian countries had a hand in colonizing us for generations so in their eyes, we will never be equal. The only south or south east asians Koreans would accept are white- or Korean- passing ones. It is seriously fuck up.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>This [Desi influencer ](https://twitter.com/thushaa/status/1309976863431950336?s=21)raised $84,000 to charity dedicated to the Sri Lankan Bombing Victims. She claimed the money will be withdrawn to her bank account and subsequently donated to a Sri Lankan State Minister (who had came out and [denied](https://twitter.com/jessiefer/status/1310901021036539910?s=21) even knowing her or her gofundme). It had been 1.5 years since the  #8220;scam #8221; and the people who donated to the cause still don #8217;t know where the money went.

We have no idea where that money go, we only take her words for it (that she indeed gave it directly to some victims she personally met). Even with that assumption, there is still around $62,000 left unaccounted for. Many people had suspected she used the money for plastic surgery and a new house.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Non-black people giving their opinions where it doesnt belong is inevitable. I reread the post again and she doesnt mention that her issue was that non-black people is hopping on the trend to call out Hwasa. Her issue is that people are being mean to Hwasa using African culture - black or not. It doesnt dismiss the fact that all the Hwasa posts are made by **black people majority**. Not to mention, a lot of non-black commenters on that post is also using OP narrative to invalidate/detract/erase the the main point: Hwasa had repeatedly appropriate black culture for aesthetics and for profits.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Tbh all the receipts are pretty damning and her modeling agency just deleted all of her photos (she also remove their name from her bio). She is hiding behind the [cyberbullying excuses](https://twitter.com/thushaa/status/1311161627627134976?s=21) to detract from the fact that she scammed a lot of people. Tbh, when the accusation first came out, the first thing she does was not addressing the situation but restricted her comment section. I think she thinks if she doesn #8217;t speak about it then it will blows over. Not only that, she was actively liking comments and commenting back to people who were gassing her up. (Tbf those are the only people who is allowed to comment anyway).

She is claiming her breast surgery was free/paid by the Canadian government because it was deformed to the point of causing her distress. No one on twitter is buying this. She is claiming to return the fund not bc she cares abt her followers but bc she got caught. Period. She said she was given no chances to explain herself. She has had many chances (ppl were def asking) for the last 1.5 years to explain where the $84,000 went. This is not anyone #8217;s fault but her own and she is not owning up to it. Instead, she deflect the blames back at her followers and [return the money ](https://twitter.com/sthmrthy/status/1311150039386001408?s=21)after she got caught.

    <TEXT>Yeah she is definitely twisting the narrative. She said she was gonna explain where the funds go but there was a  #8220;minor #8221; delay. Girl ITS BEEN 1.5 YEARS. Im glad no one on twitter is falling for this bs self-victimizing shit. [I dont think you are the only one](https://twitter.com/akhaleesiii/status/1311164502566608902?s=21) who is disappointed at this. A lot of young girls look up to her and they are betrayed and hurt.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>The tiktok influencer that is being called out in this video is accused of pandering to pedos. She has a lot of videos acting like a child for views and a lot of people has a problem with this. Even the tiktoker herself said she doesn #8217;t talk or act like this irl. Not to mention, she purposely covered up all her tattoos to make herself look younger. She is also hanging out with Tyga who, might I add, dated Kylie Jenner - a girl he knew since she was 14. Aside from that, a 24 years old purposefully acting like a 13 years old for views is hella weird. She has some scandals too. She has the imperial Japanese Army rising sun tattooed on her arm. That shit is a no-no if you are an asian and know how fuck up Japanese colonialism was (she #8217;s filipino). She also called one of her black friend Harambe. She said he is cool with it bc it #8217;s his nickname. However, people who had seen the actual fb comments said he was weirded out.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Yeah im glad other people esp. women are calling her out on it. This kinda childish portrayal is cute for cosplay purposes but when it is out of cosplay (shes not even cosplaying like 99% of the time), it is fucking toxic and gross. People are saying shes hiding those tattoos bc they looks bad. I mean, aside from her controversl rising sun tat, she cant just up and decided ALL of her 20 tattoos look bad. Ugh. Its weird seeing how some girls looking up to her and how diehard her fanbase is.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>A [Desi influencer ](https://twitter.com/thushaa/status/1309976863431950336?s=21)raised $84,000 to charity dedicated to the Sri Lankan Bombing Victims. She claimed the money will be withdrawn to her bank account and subsequently [donated](https://twitter.com/athaudadasuni/status/1310852594453983234?s=21) to the church that was bombed. The church had recently came out and [denied](https://twitter.com/crysxkoel/status/1310114816845996032?s=20) even knowing her or her gofundme (See: Update 4). It had been **1.5 years **since the  #8220;scam #8221; and the people who donated to the cause still don #8217;t know where the money went. She ended up only donating [$20,000](https://twitter.com/lifeinbrowntown/status/1310989590493233152?s=20) and then asked for a [refund](https://twitter.com/crysxkoel/status/1310917587035856896?s=21) of that same $20,000 because she directly made contact with some victims who need immediate urgent cares and she would like to help them directly (See: Update 10 of that thread). We have no idea where that money go, we only take her words for it (that she indeed gave it directly to some victims she personally met). Even with that assumption, there is still around $62,000 left unaccounted for. Edit: [official statement](https://www.facebook.com/100986456650065/posts/to-whom-it-may-concernre-donation-by-ms-ishini-weerasinghe-we-are-very-disturbed/3443260255755985/) by the church confirming she asked for the $20k refund. (Picture of the receipts included at the end) When the accusation first came out, the first thing she does was not addressing the situation but restricted her comment section. I think she thinks if she doesn #8217;t speak about it then it will blows over. Not only that, she was actively liking comments and commenting back to people who were gassing her up (Tbf those are the only people who is allowed to comment anyway). In addition, she and her fans were [cyberbullying](https://twitter.com/senuvidulmini/status/1311150263558983686?s=21) people who [asked her for proof ](https://twitter.com/thushaa/status/1311200774215606277?s=21)at the time too. There are multiple twitter threads who had called the minister and the church in question and everyone denied knowing or working with her. Not only that, the refund thing is too absurd to be made up.

She claimed she was gonna update her followers but there was a  #8220;minor delay #8221;. It #8217;s been **1.5 years**. She said she was given no chances to explain herself. She has had many chances (ppl were def asking) for the last 1.5 years to explain where the $84,000 went. This is not anyone #8217;s fault but her own and she is not owning up to it. Instead, she deflect the blames back at her followers and [return the money ](https://twitter.com/sthmrthy/status/1311150039386001408?s=21)after she got caught. As of right now, her modeling agency just deleted all of her photos (she also remove their name from her bio). She is hiding behind the [cyberbullying excuses](https://twitter.com/thushaa/status/1311161627627134976?s=21) to detract from the fact that she scammed a lot of people.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>That professor is pretty chummy with another white supremacist named Charles A. Murray. He even invited him to speak at Harvard at one point but the event got intense backlash:  gt; After The Crimson reported that Kane invited Charles A. Murray  #8217;65 to deliver a talk as part of the course, another student suggested that  #8220;Field #8221; might be Kane, Queen said.  gt; Murray  #8212; whose work the Southern Poverty Law Center has called  #8220;racist pseudoscience #8221;  #8212; is scheduled to lecture on Oct. 16 regarding his 2020 book  #8220;Human Diversity: The Biology of Gender, Race, and Class. #8221; Murray #8217;s book criticizes the ideas that gender and race are social constructs and that class is a function of privilege, arguing instead that groups of people differ genetically.  gt; Kane defended his decision to invite Murray in a Tuesday email to The Crimson, writing that he finds it important for students to be exposed to more right-wing perspectives. If he wanted right-wing perspective, I dont think it was wise to invite someone who is known to believe in eugenics. Here is his [profile](https://www.splcenter.org/fighting-hate/extremist-files/individual/charles-murray) at the Southern Poverty Law Center:  gt; **About Charles Murray**  gt; According to Murray, disadvantaged groups are disadvantaged because, on average, they cannot compete with white men, who are intellectually, psychologically and morally superior. Murray advocates the total elimination of the welfare state, affirmative action and the Department of Education, arguing that public policy cannot overcome the innate deficiencies that cause unequal social and educational outcomes. In their summary: Charles Murray, a fellow at the American Enterprise Institute, has become one of the most influential social scientists in America, using racist pseudoscience and misleading statistics to argue that social inequality is caused by the genetic inferiority of the black and Latino communities, women and the poor. He has wrote books and give talks about this very topic so his opinions are very well-known. He has a public record of spewing these shit.</TEXT>

The story created so much outrage that foreign teachers are told outright to  #8220;not molest students #8221; and that if caught, they will be banned from teaching in China. I think China should ban them from entering the country altogether. Im sure there are cases like that scatters around Asia as well. Sexual predators do take advantage of the absence of background checks to get themselves closer to their victims. I hope Asian countries will enact stricter background check laws to protect students.

    <TEXT>He taught English in China and Saudi but not long term (i think a year max). Before that he went to college outside of Massachusetts. He came back to MA to work but spend most of his time traveling cross-country and fuck around abroad. He just came back to US in May 2020. I dont think he ever sticked around long enough to know what MA-8 constituent want or need. Teaching English abroad is a super common thing that young people do. However, I don #8217;t think it qualify as some kind of international relation experience he is making it out to be. More often than not, students who can afford English lessons are from middle- to upper-class families so he only saw a fraction of Chinese and Saudi society. He also keep hammering the fact that he taught high school economics and history. Dude, a majority of the incumbent here has advanced law degrees or other kind of PhD. Not to mention, they had been a long-term resident of the district they represent and really able to connect with their people. OP seem like he read news articles on reddit and think that is enough political training. I think his experiences are bogus and he need more formal training and experiences before running. A lot of his replies here give me major red flags.</TEXT>

Will there be an increase in taxes to pay for this program? Why would you think proposing UBI now is a good way to go after we had barely keep up with COVID unemployment payouts?

    <TEXT> gt; It takes less political capital to implement a 1-year UBI than it does a UBI without end, wouldn't you agree? All the details of the UBI will have to get negotiated out in committee, or pressured by Congress or the public. Maybe it ends up being a $400/month UBI #8212;okay, at least we're still getting somewhere. Yang's UBI is an aspiration, and so is mine. I know I'd be just one voice and vote among many, and I'm not running for President. No single Congressperson can swing UBI on his/her own. You do understand that you have to propose and write the bill right? All the details and research about its effectiveness and feasibility need to be done BY YOU if you wanna propose it. There is no imaginary UBI committees somewhere that you can waltz into. You still haven #8217;t answer my questions: How did you get to that $400/month figure? How will you get the money to fund UBI? Will our taxes be increased to pay for your UBI program? If yes, we are in a pandemic and many people had lost their jobs, how will convince these people that taxes are going to be higher?</TEXT>

    <TEXT> gt; I am to propose or co-sign something, but I will have a team of people around me that will help do the work.  gt; $400 was just an example of what Congress might be willing to pass through compromise (still unlikely). I only used it as an example of compromise and how we should be willing to be flexible with our aspirations and goals. So you don #8217;t have a concrete UBI plan nor did you do any UBI research. It seems like you expect to be able to just put your name on another bill as cosigner or have a team of people doing the legwork for you? You still havent tell me where the money for your UBI program will come from btw. This is not the work ethics or the attitude I want in a representative. I hope you get more experiences or better yourself before you run again. Have a nice day.</TEXT>

    <TEXT> gt; We have to be able to talk about immigration without people making accusations of racism. It's hamstrung the entire discourse in a very unhelpful way.  gt; I think we should preference young, educated English speakers who generally share American values (respect for democracy, hard work, live and let live). You specifically said immigration in your first paragraph. When you work abroad in China and Saudi, you are also considered an **immigrant** to them. Your inability of speaking Mandarin or Arabic fluently did not hamper your entry into either countries. I find it highly hypocritical for you to come back to the US and demanding English fluency in order to enter YOUR country. This opinion comes from a place of ignorant and privilge and I hope you educate yourself in the future before making these kind of statement. Not to mention, a majority of your MA-8 district is full of first- and second-gen immigrants from countries where English isnt taught as first language. How will they feel when a congressional candidate who suppose to represent them said that? This is a major red flag for me because it seem like you don #8217;t know your constituents well enough.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I agree with you. Your original comment has a lot of good suggestions. I like it when people my age take an active stance in politics but I won #8217;t throw my suppose behind this guy. His values on immigration and UBI are so poorly researched to the point that I don #8217;t think he did any research actually. Instead of just assuming your campaigning experiences and talk down to you like he did in his reply, he should have been more professional and courteous. If this is how he talks to a random redditor who was trying to help his campaign, I don #8217;t want to know how he will interacts with people in MA State House or DC.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>That professor is pretty chummy with another white supremacist named Charles A. Murray who believe anyone who is non-white male is inferior (full-on eugenics actually). Given that this professor #8217;s class is an intro class and everyone has to take it, it is not a stretch to say there are women and POCs in his class - people who he thinks is intellectually and physically inferior to him. I am all for having different opinions but when your opinion is that I am basically inferior to you genetically, physically, and intellectually, that is not an opinion but an outright racist statement. We should not let these discriminatory statements be an opinion anywhere. Also, he even invited Charles A. Murray to speak at Harvard at one point but the event got intense backlash:  gt; After The Crimson reported that Kane invited Charles A. Murray  #8217;65 to deliver a talk as part of the course, another student suggested that  #8220;Field #8221; might be Kane, Queen said.  gt; Murray  #8212; whose work the Southern Poverty Law Center has called  #8220;racist pseudoscience #8221;  #8212; is scheduled to lecture on Oct. 16 regarding his 2020 book  #8220;Human Diversity: The Biology of Gender, Race, and Class. #8221; Murray #8217;s book criticizes the ideas that gender and race are social constructs and that class is a function of privilege, arguing instead that groups of people differ genetically.  gt; Kane defended his decision to invite Murray in a Tuesday email to The Crimson, writing that he finds it important for students to be exposed to more right-wing perspectives. If he wanted right-wing perspective, I dont think it was wise to invite someone who is known to believe in eugenics. Here is his [profile](https://www.splcenter.org/fighting-hate/extremist-files/individual/charles-murray) at the Southern Poverty Law Center:  gt; **About Charles Murray**  gt; According to Murray, disadvantaged groups are disadvantaged because, on average, they cannot compete with white men, who are intellectually, psychologically and morally superior. Murray advocates the total elimination of the welfare state, affirmative action and the Department of Education, arguing that public policy cannot overcome the innate deficiencies that cause unequal social and educational outcomes. In their summary: Charles Murray, a fellow at the American Enterprise Institute, has become one of the most influential social scientists in America, using racist pseudoscience and misleading statistics to argue that social inequality is caused by the genetic inferiority of the black and Latino communities, women and the poor. He has wrote books and give talks about this very topic so his opinions are very well-known. He has a public record of spewing these shit.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>But thats the problem, if Charles Murray or David Kane wanted to talk about the coddling of the left or whatever, thats fine. It is a fair opinion. However, what they want to talk about is **eugenic** and **how anyone who is a non-white male is genetically, physically, and intellectually inferior to them**. That is not an academic opinion. That is a full on neo-nazi statement and should not be given a spotlight in any legitimate institutions. This class is an intro class so all undergrad at Harvard is required to take it. How would you feel if you are a black student or female student who take his class? Do you think you will be graded fairly? Also, How would you feel if the person teaching you already has a bias that you are inferior to him? In this situation, safety and ethical concerns are legitimate and I stand with the students.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Walmart is a retail chain that sell pretty much everything. Their in-store pharmacy sell an older version of insulin at $25/dose. A lot of people who look to defend pharma pricing crisis had been using  #8220;walmart insulin #8221; as an excuse. For ex,  #8220;Can #8217;t afford normal insulin bc it costs thousands $$$ for a dose? Just use Walmart insulin #8221; while ignoring that Walmart insulin haven #8217;t been includ in modern standard of care for 20 years now bc the formula is so outdated and has a lot of severe side effects.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I feel like it is better to err on the side of caution and not destroy any rock piles/cairns. Some of these piles serves as trail markings and are crucial for directional purposes. Tbh if a cairn is out of place, the park rangers will take care of it since they know which cairns are there on purpose and which one are not.</TEXT>

I highly doubt she will ever be under investigations. She is rich and famous with a solid fanbase. She is also dating US Senator Cory Booker who is politically connected (he was also a presidential candidate). The odds are stacked against Dedrek.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>https://vm.tiktok.com/ZMJ51nVSv/ Here is the link to the full video. He first argues that some groups shouldnt be clamoring equality because they dont deserve it because the constitution does not take into account  #8220;equality #8221;. He also said that poor people are poor because they arent hard-working enough or learn profittable skills which are really bullshit arguments. He pretty much is saying if you are born into poverty, black, gay, woman, or disable, that is completely your fault for not being able to rise above it. Im all for self-sufficiency but it is hard to achieve  #8220;equality #8221; if you are a member of those groups because of things such as systematic racism, financial hardships, lack of opportunities for disable populations, so on and so forth. Sorry if I dont make any sense but this is the vibe I get from watching the whole video. He is also deleting a lot of comments on his video echoing my same sentiments.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Source: [The Today Show](https://www.today.com/news/doorbell-camera-captures-moment-nobel-prize-winner-told-he-won-t194153) The Nobel Committee was unable to contact Stanford professor Paul Milgrom, so his neighbor and fellow winner, Robert Wilson, showed up at his door with the news. The reaction of a Stanford professor who was named a Nobel Prize-winner in economics was captured early Monday for the world thanks to a doorbell camera and a persistent colleague. The Nobel Committee apparently had some trouble contacting Paul Milgrom to let him know the winning news, so his neighbor and fellow winner, Robert Wilson, took matters into his own hands. Wilson knocked on Milgrom #8217;s door about 2:15 a.m. to get his colleague #8217;s attention, according to Stanford University. [...] Milgrom and Wilson were both honored for improvements to auction theory and inventions of new auction formats, Secretary General G #246;ran Hansson of the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences said Monday. Milgrom's work included the analysis of bidding strategies to determine how the format of an auction can give the seller higher expected revenue as bidders gauge the private value others place on the item on sale. Wilson's work led to the theory of a common value, which is the best estimate of what an item is worth that bidders then try to set their offers below to avoid overpaying.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>If you ever defend a woman or girl gamer, everyone will call you names like  #8220;simp #8221; #8217;or  #8220;white knight #8221;. It make it seem like there is a stigma to stick up for women in gaming community. Some people are also very non-confrontational so ig thats the other reason. I agree with you. Throughout this entire video, only one guy speak up but he wasnt even speaking up for her. He said  #8220;maybe don #8217;t say that #8221; bc that asshole asked  #8220;what happened if I said I want to rape a 13 yo rn? #8221;. I hope people will speak up against online abusers like this asshole. Being silent and not calling out toxic behavior when you can is the same as being complicit in these behaviors.</TEXT>

At least you can sleep better at night knowing you #8217;re not a piece of shit. Edit: Updates 1: She said on her stream that she used to these languages but she wasn #8217;t up for it that day. This video happened about 20 minutes into her stream and it ruined the rest of the night. She said she cried afterward I think. She is very surprise and happy with the outpouring support from reddit and tiktok though. **Her twitch handle is [Tiffae](https://twitch.tv/tiffae) and shes streaming rn if you wanna head over and send her a msg of support** (please mod this is not doxxing, she already knew this post exist, at least let her get some supports) Update 2: She said in her recent stream that an Epic employee reached out to her. Hopefully they find him and ban him. Most importantly, you guys made her night. Shes literally look so happy, I think you guys made her cry happy tears. This situation ended better than I expected. Im glad I didn #8217;t stop reposting this clip everywhere. She said you guys can reach her on [Twitch](https://twitch.tv/tiffae) (@Tiffae) or her [Discord](http://www.discord.gg/tiffae). She said shes on discord 24/7.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I think so. I read all the comments on this post and it has some heartbreaking story about women gamers going through toxic chat like this. One of these assholes even manage to track these women to their irl job. Will link you to her comments. ([Here](https://reddit.com/r/iamverybadass/comments/jdkkpl/_/g9a4in4/?context=1)) Also a lot of men reply to my posts and told me their wife/gf went through the same thing. The harassment indeed get more toxic when these lowlifes find out you are a girl.</TEXT>
