    <TITLE>Apparently this stuff absorbs through everywhere...</TITLE>
    <DATE>2019-07-14 12:15:05</DATE>
    <TEXT>Okay, basically. I rolled up 2 blotters and put them in me dick. I /read/ on here that apparently it won't absorb through the urethra and that it'd have to liquid and shit. Lies. All lies. I'm hella trippin. Trust yourself first, then the random internet people  #8203; Short trip report: I put it in, and then felt that weird heavy lung feeling and was like "nahhh this cant be it... but it kinda feels like it". Shortly after i got the body feel and was like "okay, yeah, fuck this actually works" and already was rainbow-like figures appear when i close my eyes. I then proceeded to talk to my parents a bit and be on the PC talking to a friend. I had like slight complementary visuals, but nothing too groundbraking, since it was only 200ug. Closed eyes had a tiny bit going on but nothing special really. I later decided to vape a bit of weed, then shit went insane. I looked at my phone, to write my friend, and after looking at the screen and characters for a while, characters start appearing accross my vision in a big rainbow font that looked like it was made of thin metal like a samurai sword and the rainbow pattern was as if the font was rainbow due to it being so reflective. It looked really cool and i was like "wow... this is amazing!" I then like listened to music and ate the food my parents gave me, i told them i "wasn't feeling so well today" and they bought it. Closed eye visuals were very interesting and vivid. After taking a bong hit, i went to my car and started it. I felt every explosion happening in those 3 cylinders and revving the engine was amazing. I did a few minor things until i decided to take a big bong hit at 2 AM Big mistake, then things got messy in my brain and i was tired, that's when things got uncomfortable. I went to sleep and woke up, still a little out of tune, but i returned to normal after being high a few days.</TEXT>

    <TITLE>[1P-LSD] Trip doesn't end until sleep</TITLE>
    <DATE>2019-07-18 12:37:57</DATE>
    <TEXT>Hi, i don't know if this post was made before but i am very curious have found nothing so far on the internet.  #8203; I have never actually tripped on actual LSD. I always just tripped on 1P-LSD with friends. We all noticed, that the trip never actually ends until we sleep. I had a trip going on for 18 hours and it's intensity didn't slow down ever since the 6 hour mark. Everyone always says "12 hours" is one trip but with my and my friends expierience it's weird. And the weirdest thing is, my bestie went to sleep at the 5 hour mark, WAS ABLE TO SLEEP, and then woke up 7 hours later completely normal again?  #8203; Has anyone expierienced something similar or has any idea why this could be?</TEXT>

    <TITLE>Smoked Syrian Rue + Vaped DMT Expierience</TITLE>
    <DATE>2019-07-27 22:11:47</DATE>
    <TEXT>I feel like it's something that somebody surely must've posted here before, but i cannot find it. Anyways. I smoked a bit less than 1g of syrian rue seeds, which i beat up into powder in a big bowl prior, with my bong. It smells a bit less bad than burnt hair and tastes like nothing and maybe a bit bitter. Hurt in the lung a bit but generally easier to smoke than weed. After deciding to not smoke more i vaped my DMT with my dry herb vaporizer. You can do this with anything though i suppose. I put 50mg freebase in it. The trip lasted about 1 hour maybe more. In hindsight it didn't feel like my typical DMT expierience, where i take in as much as i can and peak and go back too quickly for my taste. It was more like the buzz of a joint, where every 20 minutes i'd take a lil puff to get a bit more buzzed again. But instead of being a cannabis buzz, it was a DMT buzz with visuals and everything. There was no rush. I was on different levels throughout the trip. At first i decided i wanted to go out and then met entities and also was taught something. Which i forgot ofc. Later i took more DMT and was only on a slight level. With alot of visuals and chaos in my head but not transcendent. I felt like puking a few times but didn't. I would always expect puking though and have a bucket ready, just to be sure. It was really relaxed and lasted satisfyingly long but not too long to freak me out. I definitely recommend this. As i said, the syrian rue was a little disgusting, but totally worth it.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Sure thanks, i think i'll get into it after some time. Right now i'm experimenting smoking the rue though. Wanna look into smoking the freebase extract nice and quickly with a bong because smoking 1.5g of seeds is kinda tedious and disgusting I wish i had a DMT vape pen, instead i use an Airizer Air and kitchen paper to contain the molten DMT. It works well when you dont have to rush the DMT due to MAOIs</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Well, it took me 1.5g of Syrian Rue seeds to stay a while longer. I smoked it in a bong cause they require alot of heat and i don't think a joint will be able to deliver that. Though, recently i've been trying oit harmala freebase. That makes the expierience very internal. 100mg of the freebase and i need to puke once and the rest of the trip i literally feel like passing out. Like, while standing i usually almost lose consciousness and just fall down flat. Smoking a max of 70mg seems to do the trick there. Again, i smoke it in a bong and it's much easier to smoke 70mg of freebase than 1.5g of seeds. You can try freebase in a joint but i dunno if it will be hot enough. Try it out! Harmala freebase is legal like the seeds and you can buy them online. You might need to look around where though depending on your country. Again, try it with the freebase, cause that sounds interesting.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Oh no, you need to understand, that the very reason why vaped DMT only lasts 15 Minutes is because mono amine oxidases are in your whole body and when you flood your system with DMT via the lungs, while it does bypass the digestive system which acts as kind of a buffer, it's still actively broken down by MAOs in your blood  amp; brain. So if you smoke MAOIs, the vaped DMT won't be broken down as quickly.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I don't know how ayahuasca is. But to me it's like a normal DMT trip, it just doesn't wear off. So you blast off and have this intense expierience but it just doesn't stop. Seemingly. After time you'll notice it wearing off. The amount of MAOIs does determine the length of the expierience, however, the more you smoke the stronger the negative effects and risks become. It does affect your serotonin so if you mess it up too much you might have negative side effects. When it comes to puking, i usually enjoy puking because it gets rid of 85% of the sick feeling. But i don't have to every time. It depends on how much harmala extract you smoke and what is in your stomach. I haven't experimented enough with it already to say what exactly determines whether you need to or not. But if you feel like it, i recommend doing it. I still want to try 1g syrian rue tea because the 3 grams messed me up. Drinking MAOIs (harmalas are RIMAs btw, they're not as dangerous) apparently makes them stick around longer. Smoking them makes their effects wear off after like 4 to 5 hours. Almost like a weed high</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Well i guess it's all just in the interest of conquering areas and getting food and stuff we want the way we want easier. Like all animals. Tbh though, i don't know maybe we are some god given thing or something. Maybe our chemical forms are just carriers of our spirits. Who knows.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>At the moment, my animal theory seems more plausible to me than any others i've heard so far so i personally go with that. But you're right our minds are capable of achieving great stuff to get what we want. Especially our creative mind is something never seen before in the animal kingdom. Either evolution made humans have really great chemical computers or there is something else outside of our bodies.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Well if you say chemical computers then we're basically animals with highly developed and complicated neural networks. Because animals are chemical robots in a sense. And with something else i was playing at the idea that consciousness the way we feel it is something beyond our physical form i mean the way it looks scientifically would suggest that we're chemical robots running on autopilot like plants, animals and all of existance. But it's not like that, hell, even i feel like my thoughs my mood and my entire brain is still something outside of the observing consciousness. Again, i don't know what's right. I just know what i believe to make the apparatus questioning these things shut up.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Yes exactly, obviously, taking more makes it last longer too. I was planning on taking MAOIs before, but A) i have no way to smoke them and B) MAOI + vaped DMT makes me feel sick and like i'm about to collapse and pass out and also upsets my stomach. So pure dmt is much nicer and cleaner. Also the dmt comedown makes it easier to relax while still having deep boundless thoughts and visuals. It felt like an hour i was there, taking low doses again and again. But i don't know how long it actually was</TEXT>

Suddenly the world seemed extremely different as it did to that point. I couldn't control my body how i wanted and i felt like i'm disabled.

    <TITLE>Overwhelming ego death on 500ug 1P-LSD</TITLE>
    <DATE>2019-10-06 09:08:05</DATE>
    <TEXT>There isn't really that much to this trip report but i still feel the need to share this. So i always took lower doses and really like the body feel and the visuals. I think i was generally going for "having a good time". But this time i obviously took more and i feel like i had my first proper ego death. And now i know why people say it's scary. The comeup was very very scary and intense at one point but as i "arrived" in the mindset i gained a self again, a slightly altered tripping self, but myself. The visuals were great but as i smoked weed at the peak i lost my self and the ability to appreciate the trip with that. I lost absolute control over my thoughts and everything went by on it's own in my head. Of course i thought i fucked up my brain. Apparently i remember digging up some deep and maybe dark shit about myself and my life which i don't remember and which was very painful. I kept telling myself that i must stop trying to find my ego and "let go" but it was impossible to do so because i just became a computing machine. The visuals were so intense that the closed eye visuals overlayed reality when i opened my eyes and closed and open eyes felt the same to me. I started freaking out and kept beating myself up, i think for not being able to let go. And the worst thing is that i had absolutely no control. After freaking out too much and the ego death not going away and me not being as patient as i wanted to i took trip killers. Ones you buy in pills in the netherlands which sold publicly and labeled "Trip stoppers" and i think which are for 2 people. But i took all of them. Then going to bed to best of my ability i noticed they weren't working and kept telling myself they will. After what felt way too long i started getting the sleepy vibes as you would expect from a fuck ton of Xanax. And my brain and body were in a sleep state but underneath it i could still feel the trip going on with full intensity. SO I DIDN'T ACTUALLY EVER FALL ASLEEP. Eventually i noticed that the weed high went away and that reality formed again. But i was wide awake. Then i beat myself up over taking trip killers even though they apparently just calmed me down and didn't really kill the trip. I thought that A) it is a shame that i took a trip killer because you're not supposed to end that enlightening expierience and B) now i actually damaged/messed up my brain by taking a harmful tripkiller. I noticed i couldn't sleep. And so i panicked over the thoughts i had about the trip killers. I opened my eyes and it felt like dreaming so i thought i was in delirium and REALLY messed up my brain. I couldn't sleep for the next 8 hours I eventually, after alot of mental stress and with calming music, got 1 hour of sleep in. Waking up i was still far from myself and tried distracting myself and tried sleeping over and over which was still nearly impossible. My mental capabilities were still extremely limited. I looked depressed to my grandma. I eventually got a bit of sleep here, a bit of sleep there and then at night a bit here and there and i feel like eventually around 5 to 7 AM at night (the next night after the trip mind you) i regained the ability to sleep easier. Now it's 11 AM and i feel like myself again. This was a horrible trip for me. In retrospect i feel like i shouldn't have taken the tripkillers but in that moment i was very close to freaking out that i would've taken a bullet if i could've. I was home alone. Big mistake.</TEXT>

    <DATE>2019-10-11 15:02:42</DATE>
    <TEXT>Notify me if this is the wrong subreddit. So, i have been doing alot of psychedelics recently. DMT here, Mushrooms once and LSD often during the last year. But ever since a DMT trip in September, whenever i take psychedelics i feel like nothing has meaning anymore and i feel really depressed and as if i have some sort of psychotic mental illness. I have been smoking alot of weed too but just got rid of the daily use of that and started to focus on stuff again and work out. I have been depressed with the "pointlessness" until recently when i started focusing and working out again. Now i feel great and everything in sober life makes sense and has meaning. I just did DMT and the same thing came back to me, making me feel like i won't i understand the world anymore, like nothing has meaning and very depressed. Luckily, i came back to myself. But i am still very curious what it is. Could it be that this is a kind of "if you get the message, hang up the phone" kind of thing? Could it be that i overused psychedelics? Or is it simply the withdrawal of weed combined with psychedelic use? I'd like to hear some ideas and maybe stuff from people with similar expieriences.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Okay, i know it's my task to define meaning. But what you need to do that is motivation and inspiration. And when psychedelics devoid me of all meaning and joy, there is literally nothing anymore. Funnily though, weed is the thing giving me back meaning whenever i'm on it. I'm amazed about everything and remember why i'm here.</TEXT>

Whenever i appreciate everything and am amazed about everything just focusing on something instead of dwelling on the mysteries of existance. I mean i feel like working out and doing things, learning, playing, getting things done and such are what makes me happy.

    <TEXT>Yes. I also feel like this depression and pointlessness i get from psychedelics is a direct sign. Because losing my happiness about myself is one of the worst things ever for me. And i think i won't touch them again. Weed on the other hand i've been addicted to. Smoking it every day. After quitting it for some time i rediscovered that waiting it out and focusing on something is what keeps me happy. I want a healthy relationship with it, showing me whenever i do smoke it that things arent too bad. I wanna try a healthy relationship with it. But i will keep away from psychedelics for now</TEXT>

    <TITLE>Depersonalization induced by DMT</TITLE>
    <DATE>2019-10-12 10:39:50</DATE>
    <TEXT>Hello, i'm a 20 year old male and i've been doing DMT for a year now, LSD multiple times and Shrooms once too. I only ever did low dose DMT trips which were fun and eye opening towards to beauty of the world. However, on one DMT trip i felt like something cracked and i felt depersonalized on it. On a prior post i made i said it felt like i now "induced mental illness". Ever since that trip i felt disconnected from everything from time to time or everything just seemed boring. The DMT trips after that were boring too. I tripped on LSD and felt even more disconnected/pointless about me and my life until i slept a few times and came back. After the LSD trip 1 week ago, i felt disconnected from time to time still and it's gotten really bad and depressing sometimes. I smoked weed on the following monday and it felt like it gave me back myself for some time. Then i started working out on wednesday and focusing on my new university which made me feel like myself again and it felt more permanent. Then i did DMT 2 days later (yesterday) and on the trip i had that feeling of disconnection again. During this trip it was way shorter though than the last time that happened. But i had it again after the trip. However, not as bad as it was before. Though, weed on the same day didn't gave me back myself and just made me worry. Now i feel like half myself and half not myself. It keeps fluctuating. Does anyone have any idea what the fuck is going on???</TEXT>

    <TEXT>If it's one thing that the PSYCHEDELICS are telling me then it is to focus on life. They always showed me the beauty of being alive and motivated me after coming back how great being alive can be. They always gave the same message "Enjoy life. Get out of this space of wisdom and LIVE." in a positive light. But recently after doing it over and over it's been more like "go away, be glad to be a monkey and to have the mind you got" I mean if this IS all a lesson, and there is some entity in my head guiding all of this, then right now it's doing this to me by making me both feel okay and not okay at the same time. Yeah no, but i'm, unfortunately, done with psychedelics.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>It's just that the landscape of my thoughts changes all the time. I had been doing mindful meditation but i kind of didn't continue. I'm afraid it'll put me in the disconnected state. I'll try it again though. One of the trips prior to the horror told me i should meditate. But that was honestly just from a YouTube video i watched. I'll try doing more mindful meditation and actually do something with my life instead of being presented with alot of mental wisdom all the time to then just not do anything with it. All my trips recently had similar visions though. The last couple trips often have been some sort of being shoving something into me. Like "yeah here is this knowledge you so want or whatever"</TEXT>

Living a peaceful life in a perfect world? Worthless. Helping people? Worthless. Everything. No matter what i thought would make me happy i could feel nothing from my brain. And hell did i care about what bloody society was doing. I just thought nothing makes sense, we are all doomed no matter what system we live in and should just all kill ourselves.

No matter what i thought of, it felt like i was watching my life through a screen. Nothing had any meaning. Beautiful past memories, worthless. Things i used to enjoy, video games, music, art, nature, animals, meeting people, technology? All worthless. Okay, so instead of dwelling on the past, how about assuming all my past things didn't make me happy actually and now i should look for a purpose that makes me genuinely happy. Working towards world peace, helping people, making others happy? Meeting more friends? All worthless. Nothing is nice or has meaning and i should just kill myself. That's what i went through the recent 5 days and only feel likr now i am returning to normal.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Yeah cause i've been doing alot of psychedelics to show me the beauty of the world and to explore my mind. But recent DMT trips and LSD trips ended in me feeling trapped inside my mind and caused symptoms of depersonalization and derealization for multiple days. Smoking at that time just made things more confusing. Before my recent trips i smoked every day and didn't like it. Now i wanna smoke occasionally, not more than once a week or once in 2 weeks. And i also wanna go back to psychedelics because i know how amazing they can be and feel. I absolutely want to stop dosing because i'm fond of my sober mind. I've been doing them very often recently and i feel like that has caused my subconscious to become so confused. I have been coming back over the last week. Though, if i know that i'll return from them then i wanna take them on another time because i did have an expierience that satisfied me yet.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>So, long story short, i smoked DMT alot of times, low doses, and one day it felt like something in my head cracked. After that i had derealization episodes for the last 3 weeks where i lose all joy about everything and don't see a point in life anymore, which have been going away more and more recently. Still, i just had one again and i noticed that it's not just derealization. I also for some reason need to pee alot more whenever i feel like that and my coordination also gets disoriented. I start having more pseudo hallucinations and sleeping becomes very confusing and worrying as it feels like my brain is shutting down but I, the one thinking, is still as conscious as when i am awake. It almost feels like something is not shutting up OR something causing signals that really aren't meant to be, similar to how sleeping feels on acid where you have to consciously not think. I made alot of these posts, i know, but i'm still confused and looking for something to explain this and wondering if i'm the only person ever expieriencing this.</TEXT>

The second time was just randomly feeling trapped in my head and all joy and meaning got taken from me. Then got worse the following days. Then better but still there. I don't know except that i won't touch that stuff for a few months, quit weed for some time soon and then after some time make NEW DMT and clean my vaporizer and then try it again and if it happens again then well fuck me No psychedelics for me anymore.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Ok it's not as extreme as you have. I dunno i don't accept the idea of this not going away. I did so much dmt and this never happened before and it's been going away well after the last few weeks. It shifted from "DR/DP interrupted by short periods of being myself" to "Being myself interrupted by periods of DR/DP" and i still feel like it's getting better. I don't accept this to be permanent. I mean fine if it means i cannot take serotogenic substances ever again then so be it! I had my share of amazing expieriences. I think i can let it go.</TEXT>

    <DATE>2019-11-26 16:40:56</DATE>
    <TEXT>Recap: So i have been someone who loved life for the last year and was happy he was alive since life IS a gift. No matter what i was doing, i was glad i was doing it. But then at some point whenever i wasn't smoking weed, and i've been addicted to it for like 5 months, i felt lifeless, everything felt grey and tiresome. I took DMT in that time, suddenly it felt like my mind cracked and everything inside it felt upside down and out of order. After that i took 500 ug of 1P-LSD, a trip that made me feel like everything in my life so far went wrong and that it's all directly my fault and that i am worth nothing. Standard stuff. Just couldn't go to sleep for 3 days and i was barely functional. Then i took DMT a week later and that cracking again just that after that felt like coming out of a DMT trip again and again, where everything seems pointless and i'm stuck in my mind. Weed didn't change anything it just either made me feel good when i wasn't feeling like that or EVEN MORE like that. 2 weeks i decided to take a weed break due to this. Now this is interrupted by periods where i feel normal again during the week. Where i feel like i re-learn things about life i already knew before and start feeling like a human again with human feelings and human problems. I get things like life is actually beautiful and typical stuff that motivates me to be alive again. Just too bad that completely at random i get sucked back into that trance like state that feels like coming out of a trip, where my thinking gets messy, i start having pseudo closed eye visuals, i lose all hope, everything becomes tiresome and pointless and i seemlingly forget everything i learned and it really annoys me that my mind is no longer my own and nothing i do or think matters in any way. I did homework early because i wanna play PC Games again? Too bad, you won't be able to enjoy it because you're gonna be in your weird state again! And it's not that just like addictive "bad habits" like video games, weed, food, masturbation, etc. lose their appeal, also forming good habits like working on my university stuff, meditating or working out become tiresome. And i'm just so angry that i can't even trust my own mind anymore which is really not helpful when i'm trying to do my homework for university. I'm getting lots of sleep, sometimes wake up confused in the middle of the night. I tried to stay positive all the time telling myself i'll be fine and that things aren't so bad but that gets obliterated again and again at random and i'm just so done. I hate this. Every time it happens it's almost like a reset to the post-trip mindset. I wish i could tell myself that it'll be better and i mean compared to before it has been fading and my mind is more stable. But i still don't know if i can do this and am, if anything, extremely pissed that something constantly makes me wanna kill myself. I just posted this because at the moment my mind feels the need to complain. In 2 days i'll think about this and think that this was pointless and didn't help me in any way, but still felt the need to share for some reason.</TEXT>

I mean i've been having discount version of them throughout the week where my world started to feel really small sometimes and things a bit boring, however, recently it's been hitting me hard again over the last 2 to 3 days. However, i still notice differences to how they were some time ago. Just whenever they do happen, i things seem incredibly hopeless. I really hope they will go away after time.</TEXT>

Which is why i stopped smoking weed daily after doing so for 4-5 months and try to stop other things. And honestly, it's not so hard when nothing makes you happy.

    <TEXT>I would say no because psychedelics either make you think everything you know is fake or they make you more delusional depending on how certain beliefs of yours are stored in your brain. If anything it could make him even more determined because he must've had more subconscious reason to do that than "For the glory" I say this because i have a pretty arrogant friend who was pretty condescending to me all the time. What happened during tripping? He was even more condescending. Not very empathetic. I was faced with existencialism and got convinced that nothing anyone does has any meaning, no one does anything for a good reason, all relationships are fake and we all just do certain things for no reason other than what the chemical reactions inside us dictate us to do. Not very empathetic. The result would be very unpredictable imo</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I've had really bad existencialism and DP/DR since my last trip. Because if everything i ever thought or felt doesn't matter, the negative emotions just like the positive ones, if they are all just fake, why would anything matter? If i feel like doing something i just observe it as a random thought and give it no value. All my passions are nothing. All my goals are nothing. My friends, my relationships, my emotions, all amount to nothing and as i can observe my life itself, it also amounts to nothing because nothing in it amounts to anything. Yeah i've been having a really rough time where i've been having flashbacks to my last trip and everything i used to love became tiresome and everything i ever wanted became unappealing and life itself became unappealing. But as sober time passes i come back. Things are nice again and i enjoy being a person. And whenever i feel negative emotions i tell myself that they'll and that i feel them for a reason. Whenever i feel something i don't want to feel i observe it, but whenever i feel something i want to feel, i engage into it. Because i believe we are here to love and feel. I know that nothing that i think is my true self, but rather my thoughts which i also don't have any control over in a sense. I think i've gone waay too meta and need to find myself back into my life because i've been feeling nothing but existencialism and dread the last couple of weeks. And whenever i did feel something that actually had to do with my life and my situation i was glad. No matter what emotion it was if it was a normal human emotion like anger or fear or envy or happiness or passion, i was glad whenever i did feel them. Being something is so much better than being nothing and i don't know why i'm telling you this but i feel like it's my ego needing to vent of it's frustration from the last couple of weeks.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Well, i feel like weed makes my core state more pure. And actually, my core state is altered after psychedelics. So, evenever i smoked weed i kinda got nice trippy thoughts and loved everything about life and had implicit visuals. Though, after my last trips, i had this feeling of not being myself, total chaos in my head, and depersonalization/derealization. In a sober state that is. Weed only intensified that. Sleeping did too. But when i felt good, weed gave a similar satisfaction to sleeping. I think your core mind gets intensified. When sober you have alot of assisting mechanisms like high-level programs improving system stability and even performance. But when you smoke weed, most of those get disabled and you expierience more of your core. Which is why i also think it intensifies tripping. The things that your brain uses to tell itself about reality, like certain error corrections that account for the total chaos caused by the drug, get disabled and you get to expierience more of that chaos. Hence why it intensifies the trip.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Depends on what stage of "psychedelic recovery" i am. My last psych usage raped my brain so bad that i had depersonalization and derealization and general chaos in my head, negative emotions, etc. Of course my mind was hurt a needed time to rebuild itself. During that time, weed just made it worse. Now i mostly feel great actually after this very hard phase and i haven't tried weed for a month yet but i imagine it being amazing now again. Because i remember having such a phase after lighter trips, after which the weed was amazing.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Okay, i never had a job, am 20 and never had a gf but do have friends. I did alot of drugs (DMT, LSD and weed) often out of curiosity, boredom and to lighten my mood. It broke my brain and gave me, i wouldn't say a mental illness, but rather like a mental "cold" for a bit less than 2 months. Depersonalization and derealization were the main symptoms aswell as trip flashbacks and weird sleep. Every trip ever told me that the point of life is to live it and have expieriences. To expierience life. And with that i mean just life. The pain, the suffering, the important decisions, the joy, all of regular life is beautiful. And i should live it. And i didn't listen. When it comes to friends, i'm happy to be one, but trust me, quitting drugs is the right way. At least quitting "them being the main thing of your life". Sorry, i'm not coherent, i just got woken up at 5:30 AM 5 minutes ago. Take care. ~</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I often wrote here that i've been doing low dose DMT for some time, like 6 months, and at one point after a while of doing alot of weed, LSD and DMT (not at once but like in general), a DMT trip caused me to have depersonalization and derealization for 2 months and it's only been going away steadily which has been a long and rocky road. I'm very afraid of losing my mind now. Yesterday i took a puff that didn't even cause visuals and it got me confused and panicking. It also made me sure that i wouldn't do DMT for another 5 months. Though, i think i'm gonna have to go there and face the fear of going insane huh? Any tips, given my situation?</TEXT>

And then after 6 months suddenly "Poof!"? I mean okay if i now messed up my brain and induced a mental illness all of the sudden, then sure. I guess i'll never take psychedelics again and see a psychologist. Just don't know what to tell them when i'm there. About all the symptoms that i had? About how i feel in general? Like, the symptoms have been fluctuating and going away so much, to me it feels like they're as good as gone. I guess i'll just tell them everything.</TEXT>

I gotta say, at the moment i feel pretty connected with reality and myself and feel pretty sane. Or, well, not much less sane than i did before that expierience. All i know is that i wanna stay away from psychedelics. Like, when i expierienced that, i just thoight "okay, i gotta give my mind a break from all that exploring" You gotta imagine, i did LSD, DMT, weed and shrooms every month i was convinced that i could only become happy by using those substances.

    <TEXT>Interesting. Yeah no weed has been very scary for the last two months. I couldn't enjoy it. It would make the dissociation worse. Which is one of the reasons i took a break and only came back to it recently. You know, i can wait i don't need psychedelics at the moment. Weed is good enough and being sober is amazing too. Recently i've been feeling better and i know it for a fact because weed became more comfortable again. I enjoy it again. Visuals do not scare me. That's a big change. At this point i have trouble telling if i'm even dissociating at all. I don't feel like it. Existing isn't pain anymore. It's a blessing again.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Maybe i will. Probably. However, i am very aware of my journey and am okay with it being like this and take lessons about reality and being from these phases. most of the time, anyways. Because these phases have been going down in frequency i will still wait for some time until i have kind of a baseline where i can say "THIS is how it is. I have phases like x in y timeframe.", if they don't go away by themselves. Then i'd consider therapy once i can put my finger on my condition. Because maybe it is something modern psychology knows how to analyse and maybe even fix. Until then i'll accept it as my subjective expierience and believe that it is meant to be like this, however soul crushing it might be. Then again, it all started ever since i took alot of drugs (psychedelics and weed) at once for a long time and then started suddenly. I guess solving this riddle in some way is my journey and i'm okay with that if i'm not miserable always just like i'm not happy always but happy sometimes.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Hi, i'm a guy who has an occasional-use relationship with the herb. I also like to smoke it during an acid trip because i feel it releases the acids full potential (i only use 1P-LSD btw) Now, usually though, when i have been sober for a while, the first few highs make me anxious at first (prolly also because of tolerance) and it takes me like a week of constantly being high to really get used to the feeling of an altered state. My question now is, is it somehow bad/unhealthy for the psyche/trip to be constantly smoking weed and then take acid with no "sober days" in between? Because the immediate days after a weed streak usually feel boring and dull to me. Thoughts?</TEXT>

When feeling super depressed and don't know why (maybe weed withdrawal + my specific brain chemistry) i tried psychedelics and they just made it worse. Made me realise that they are not what i should derive meaning from and that life isn't just as easy as taking a substance to solve all your internal problems. At least for me. My brain also seems to have some sort of revolting mechanism that makes the 3rd weed high in a row horrible and depressing.</TEXT>

Well it has many parts and modules to itself that it sometimes can't directly control to it's desires. Like the irrational fear of going insane and never being happy again. Identifying it is one thing but getting rid of it is also another. Fear is a frightened little animal which is hard to convince to relax.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Yeah exactly. The only time it's really dead, or rather "asleep" is on a deep psychedelic trip where you're so tripped out you forget everything. What you do with it afterwards is your thing. The best thing is i thought i dissolved mine a bit at a point and then had an intense trip and then was shocked how i didn't feel myself anymore on the trip thinking i broke myself Like no bro, just no trip made me truly lose so much of my ego as that one. It disabled many parts of my ego but left anxiety and fear enabled. Hehe, the next 6 months were a ride lemme tell ya</TEXT>

Who knows, maybe i have a subconscious anxiety that i can barely contol. If 400 were not a problem for you i'd say go for 500 with caution. And think whether you really need it. Cause i took 200 and 300 and thought like hah i want more i can handle more oh boy...</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Heh, thanks. I'm starting to feel better already but man has it been a rough ride. I don't think i ever need to explore consciousness so deep again. Or maybe i just let anxiety get the better of me. Heck. I'll go the route of using psychedelics and drugs rather rare and then enjoy the expieriences i have in contrast to sober life, rather than in contrast to other drug expieriences. Lowering my expectations and enjoy more of the little things you know. That kinda stuff.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Heh yeah. I wasn't happy in my life i was hoping the 500ug trip would give me meaning again because everything felt depressing and empty at the time. Probably just because i was smoking so much weed lol. Ye nah my last 200 trip also shit, maybe also due to weed withdrawal, maybe due to anxiety, fuck who knows. once or twice a month is even too much for me I'll smoke weed a few times and that's it. Because weed literally gives me everything i ever wish for and lsd gives me everything i don't want. Weed is even super trippy for me in itself, especially if i take long breaks between highs! I think something inserted itself into my psyche that comes forth on weed. After my last LSD trip on 200, just a few weeks ago, i was scared shitless again thinking i'll go insane. A good weed high destroyed that anxiety and now i'm just sober going through withdrawals letter the paint dry for a while and focusing on my second semester lol</TEXT>

Though, still, i'm not yearning for expieriences like that as i used to anymore, since i also had many amazing ones, and for me personally that's a gain. I wanna trip at some other point again but right now i just wanna be human for a while again, since i've been yearning for THAT for so long :-)</TEXT>

    <TEXT>It's not stupidity. Weed withdrawals can be a real bitch of despair, pushing you into corners that make you forget and just want to smoke. Just know that those feelings aren't real. They are caused by the imbalance of cannabinoids and state of your receptors. Which is why they go away when you either smoke or let your body adjust itself again by stopping to interfere with that system. The reaction your body has and the rythm it gets used to due to the prolonged rise in cannabinoid activity are the things that make you feel like shit (and sensitive and irritable and all that shit that comes with it) and want to keep smoking.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>So... after that definition i was ego-less for some time? Because for a few months i had nothing to rigorously define me. Which was crippling because none of my interests were appealing to me anymore. Nothing was exciting because it was all the same. Just "human reality" and thus, finding motivation for anything proved to be very hard, if not often impossible. I just wanted to lay and sleep forever and do nothing. I actually just wanted to finally die.</TEXT>

    <TITLE>Broke my Grounded-streak, with 0 intense cravings</TITLE>
    <DATE>2020-05-03 10:56:05</DATE>
    <TEXT>So i recently went through some of the withdrawal symptoms and stayed grounded for 4 days so far and got to a point where i genuinely wasn't interested in smoking anymore. Like yes sure smoking is great but there's tons of other fun things. But then yesterday there was a situation that i wasn't gonna have for while since someone was there as a guest. I also have a little THC cartridge and it was really fitting inside the house. So i thought "I'm not gonna have a situation like this for a while especially where this thing comes in handy so well" So i secretly got high, but unfortunately way too high and didn't get that much out of the high. It wasn't much fun really. I internally didn't even want to be high and i felt that. There wasn't even a craving that got satsified by it. But i feel this grounds me even more, because getting high isn't my main source of entertainment anymore it seems. Which i describe as a definitive positive change.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I had this situation just recently. I try to be an occasional smoker and just smoke when i feel like it. And then i was like "Okay, today was nice, now i don't need it anymore." and then i found excuses to also to it the next day. And the next. And the next. What i did then was say "Okay, you know what. I will now PLAN to smoke EVERY DAY until sunday MAX. I can quit before, but it's kind of 'booked/reserved' and okay to smoke until sunday and after that i'll take a 1 week break, preferrably 2 weeks." So i smoked every day and after every high i thought "I don't need this. I'm gonna quit now already!". I did end up smoking every day until that set DEADLINE sunday. Especially since it made the whole thing feel complete. And, what do you know, i quit on sunday 8 days ago. The following week was hell but here i am feeling much better, ready to go another week. Hope this can help in some way</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Also, you're just weak because you believe you are. You're actually in control but you choose to continue. And you have your internal reasons. Remember that. I believe once you believe there "is something inside you that makes you do this" you start believing that you can't change it. Don't give up! Even if you fail so many times, even if you feel worse and worse, if you keep wanting to quit, in the long run you'll end up quitting. You can do it! And if your addiction makes you smoke more then try leaning into it, intensifying the feeling of how much you hate binge smoking, motivating you even more to get out. Yes it can be hard, but just go with it. Feel like shit. There is light at the end of that tunnel, even if you can't see it. My withdrawals always remind me of the harry potter scene with the potion of despair where dumbledore rather kills himself than keep drining that poison, even if drinking it all up will make it stop. He despairs in the moment. Just keep walking. At the end you will find joy in everything again without smoking, less need to smoke at every opportunity, and great highs whenever you do decide to smoke again and believe you can keep the addiction at bay.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Fuck yeah. Just a fair warning, that might go away the next few days as more and more cannabinoids leave your system. My body always needs time to rebalance my endocannabinoids and regenerate the receptors, leaving me feeling empty for the 3rd to 7th day. Like it will come back and you will feel even better, but don't get bummed when it's suddenly gone for a few days. It might just stay but you will find out.</TEXT>

    <TITLE>Need quick advise: "Quitting" before 2 exams</TITLE>
    <DATE>2020-06-02 22:05:31</DATE>
    <TEXT>Hi, i don't have much problems with quitting (depending on how long  amp; often i went ofc.) but i have been smoking this last entire week every evening after studying. (I know, maybe not the best thing to do but it made me wake up rather relaxed and wakeful the next morning) My withdrawals are usually pretty strong and make me tired, lazy and unmotivated, making me enjoy nothing and questioning who i am. So today i randomly decided to stop again after this binge and i'm getting this weird feeling in the evening again and start to question: Is it really a good idea to go through the beginning of withdrawals now? Considering i was planning to maybe smoke anyways again in 3 days depending on the circumstances.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I also know this. Which is why i stopped right before now. But i also know my withdrawals are detrimental and that they cause me to not learn at all. I usually go to sleep 4-5 hours after initially smoking. It's kinda yikes the whole situation at all but it's what apparently what got me through. I try to have kind of a balance of being sober and stoned (with more sober ofc). Unfortunately, i have poor concentration which i get with weed cause i'm just FOCUSED and that lasts till the next day and goes away the more the withdrawals kick in and the cannabis effect fades.</TEXT>

    <TITLE>Status Report: this 1 month break has been great so far</TITLE>
    <DATE>2020-06-23 15:46:05</DATE>
    <TEXT>I really did struggle alot at the beginning and i didn't take off smoothly, but as of recently my life and mood have been starting to lighten up. I'm almost 2 weeks in now and don't really feel a need to smoke and start to have interest in doing things again. Even doing things i only considered fun when high. Things gained their magic back, even without weed intensifying it. That's also something i felt; as if weed seems to burn all that joy at once and at some point it's just all burned up, making me feel empty. It's good until a certain point. I still have 10g of super strong stuff (for my low tolerance anyways, 0.1 get me super high) laying around and love smelling it but have no interest of smoking it, because randomly doing so almost seems like a waste of a high, especially during this break. I even rolled a few spliffs for someone and did fantasize about trying them, but of course didn't want to at all because i felt so good because of this break : gt;. Also i hate tobacco so that was a turn-off. (Usually smoke with a tobacco substitute) Another thing i noticed, since this isn't my first attempt at a break, is that getting out of a weed binge/addiction isn't JUST about staying away from the drug, it's also about staying away from bad thoughts. I have to constantly pull myself up again when a random mood hits me and gets me depressed. So it isn't just the chemical part that plays a role here, at least for me, but also a psychological component. However, i think the most interesting part will be keeping this kind of relationship up once i allow myself to smoke again. That will be a whole 'nother challange by itself and i'm interested in how it'll turn out this time. That's all, hope you have a great day!</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I'd personally add a rule that makes you only have a high when you feel it is justified. But then again, that's a dangerous rule since that is subject to subjectivity. I think you can do it and even if you don't, you'll prolly catch yourself and make new ones that work better.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Very much. The funniest thing is sometimes when i take a long break, the first high is strong but weird and the next ones after that are magical because i kinda "believe them", leaving me feeling great even without smoking and then after a longer while it makes me depressed. I think the highs have to do with your mindset and subconcious AND they affect those two such that the highs can get better or worse all the time.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>That's cause your brain is completely tripped out on withdrawals/change of chemical balance. It learned to function with an overflow of cannabinoids and suddenly there are way too little. If you're just a little stupid then i'd say you have very mild withdrawals then, they can be way worse. Another theory is of course that the cannabis made you a bit dumber over the years but only now you notice it. Only being sober for longer will give you the answer! ^^</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Sounds great! Word of caution though: Cutting back from daily use to weekly CAN cause constant withdrawals inbetween because in the time where you're not smoking withdrawals set in, then you smoke, then you don't, withdrawals, repeat, making your only state of mind either be high or on withdrawals. !! I DON'T KNOW IF THIS WILL HAPPEN TO YOU, YOU HAVE TO TRY AND SEE. !! If this happens to you however, you can try getting to that rythm from the other side. Quitting for a certain time (at least a month) and then increase to only weekends might help.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Relate. Totally. 1000%. Been there. And honestly, one of the things i learned is that it's not so easy to just quit (for a break) without feeling like shit. But being this hard on myself never helped me. I found it's better taking the stance of "this is something hard, and i'm working on it and i can do it, it's just hard" rather than "this should be easy, how am i so weak?" because it doesn't take my strength from me when i keep believing in myself. Don't be so hard on yourself but also don't forget the problem. Know that you need to quit but be aware that that isn't an easy thing. Looking back, i was only able to quit after picking it up again. Gave me strength somehow. I did 2 weeks, fell into addiction again and went through some mental work before finally deciding that i would do it. Even then i had a dilemma at the beginning because there were really good reasons to smoke again while the break was still young but ultimately i didn't do it. At some point it's just not worth it to "break" your break anymore, you know? Also i know the feeling of not being sure if you can ever enjoy things again, but trust me, if you just keep weed off your TODO list and come up with things you wanna do, you will soon find a new, more sustainable joy that comes from inside. And you will relearn what it means to have lows and what it means to be bored and all that stuff and learn how to not let those moods get to you too much. You'll also rediscover old feelings. Also if you don't feel like doing anything, don't. Go easy on yourself. You can do it!</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Well i dunno but i also dislike being low on weed. I always make sure to have at least like 2g left (i usually smoke 0.1g when getting high at least with this current stuff). I just dislike the feeling of not having weed when i could need it. (For example when friends might come). Because getting weed can sometimes take a long time. Cause like for alcohol its easy. You wait for the stores to open and then get it. With weed, not so much. (Currently i have around 8g and i am on break! Feelsgoodman :])</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I smoked over the weekend and then yesterday i had REALLY strong cravings to do it again because it was a nice evening and i felt good. But instead i cleaned my room like i wanted to and didn't smoke and feel okay now too. THIS is hard though. But also the important part. Learning to live with cannabis. Taking a break is one thing, once i'm off it gets easier. But trying to moderate consumption. Ehh, a bit harder. Hope i can take the challenge this time and don't get back into the old habits!</TEXT>

    <DATE>2020-08-04 13:21:39</DATE>
    <TEXT>Hi, i have read on [wikichip.org](https://wikichip.org) that the Ryzen 9 3900X has a total of 20 PCIe Lanes of which, as far as i understand, 16 go to the PCIe slots and 4 go to the M.2 slots. Now, in my next build i would **prefer** to use a pretty PCIe x4 SSD instead of a tiny M.2, because i like big things. But of course i would wanna put my precious graphics card on 8x for that. So, is it possible to somehow assign those 4 lanes to the PCIe slots instead of the M.2 ones on Ryzen boards? Or do i have to settle for an M.2 and just deal with it?</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I'm far from perfect when it comes to moderating, but i'm getting there. But i wouldn't be even close to where i am now if i hadn't totally lost myself before and gone through all the triggers and cravings and whatnot. Because now i see and feel things that feel familiar but this time i know what they mean and know how to deal with them. I also know alot more about how i will feel than before when i do certain things (smoking, not smoking, take psychedelics even, etc.). I wouldn't know all this if i hadn't been here before. AND ALSO: If i didn't both know the DESPAIR i feel when i consume too much AND the BEAUTIFUL FEELING of successfully moderating, i don't know if i had the motivation to do it at all.  #8203; TL;DR: Don't despair if your moderation progress isn't going as well as you had hoped. This is part of the journey of getting there. Just never give up! You'll get there!</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I am not on a T-break but i want to moderate so in theory i'm "free" to smoke. I have let go the last week or so and smoked every day multiple times. And it did make me more relaxed because i just let go of my worries. But now after stopping again i can feel the sheer force of this "addiction" and i can totally see how i fell into addiction last time. I know these feelings and what they mean but man are they mean. The empty feeling of nothing else seeming appealing combined with the feeling of "ahh, smoking now would be sooo nice" make a really troublesome team. I almost smoked today but somehow i didn't. I also had bad mood swings and weird imbalanced feelings like feeling exhausted and tired while at THE SAME TIME feeling energized and charged. Really weird. Anyways, just wanted to share the current point in my journey :-)</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Hi, i have an old Fujitsu Primergy RX300 S3 with 8x4 DDR2 RAM, 2 CPUs, 6 SATA drives, 2 PSUs and 8 delta fans in my attic (which is a room with walls and ceiling like any other in my house so no weird particles flying around or anything) and i just wanted to know if it can cause a fire one day if keep it running for too long. I got it for free from an IT company which didn't need it anymore. I just turn in it on the days i need it and personally think that it won't be a problem because it forcefully tries to keep the CPU at 25 degrees C and is designed to run with multiple others in a hot server room anyways. But again, it's kinda old and i dunno maybe the power supplies could catch on fire? So i'm asking here</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Not a chronic user, but you have to try hard to keep it moderate. I'm having trouble doing this but am going much better than before. Just know that responsible pleasure takes alot more dicipline than no pleasure. All i do is kind of set a limit of how often i wanna smoke. Only doing it in the evenings keeps me from smoking too much.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>IMO completely quitting has the plus that you (usually) lose the cravings and get used to not doing the thing you used to. But learning to constantly successfully fight the urges and learn to integrate and deal with them, i think that is much harder, but also makes you much more stable. Just my opinion.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>It is very possible. It just takes effort. I'm in the middle of learning to moderate, letting go and pulling again, letting go and pulling again, keeping weed in my life but not letting it be the main thing. Hard thing. Came a long way and am on this journey since 10 months. I make slow but steady progress and it's getting better each week.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>well, the start of the healthy relationship after long time abusing it is quitting. Finding your center without it. You can't go from 18 bowls every day since 15 years since the age of 9 to just nice and easy 1 joint a week. The urges will be so strong that they get reignited after the first joint. I couldn't go from 4-5 bowls every day for 3 months (started around 19 years old) to a healthy relationship without feeling like shit whenever i'm not on it. After a T-break however, things look differently. But yeah you're right i've seen alot of "i'm quitting" posts here too. I too think that is better in r/leaves but also think that people here have this community of resposible people who are not all against weed but also not total potheads like r/trees. It's kind of the middle. Also people might have tried moderating here and just announcing that they "give up".</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Well, i haven't oversmoked that much recently but i already felt my mood approach those feelings that i feel when i oversmoke alor for months. Usually it feels like there is nothing left to live for in my life and that nothing is fun or exciting anymore and my drive usually goes nowhere except smoking and taking drugs. It also feels like my entire personality is just shit and fake and all the magic for everything is gone. I forget what i am or my life is about, my goals seem undesirable, everything feels tiring aaaand... hm i don't feel alive or present anymore. Kind of... "offline". And ugly parts of my personality show themselves and everything is overshadowed by existencialism, constantly thinking about how life is just torture accompanied by the need for a dopemine rush. Which isn't what life is of course but it is when all i do is get high.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Well it's our brain adapting to the high levels of cannabinoids, numbing receptors to prevent over stimulation. The result is that in different parts of the brain where the endocannabinoid system is prevalent, can't listen to it's own neurotransmitters anymore because it's SO numbed, causing us to not "feel ourselves" anymore. Gets fixed by keeping endocannaboid stimulation too low by just keeping cannabinoid levels natural after the system adapted to high cannabinoid levels.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I don't know what your issue is. You'll have to try. I know that in MY case those feelings went away AFTER TIME once i quit smoking for a while (after around 1.4 Weeks) and then feel pretty good after a month and am then able to feel great and get really nicely (and really fucking) high by keeping it moderate. Only smoking every once in a while. It helped me to find my sober center again and keep being high as kind of a thing i do that gives me exciting thoughts and is fun but not something i need and now when i encounter those feelings i know what they are, even tho they still feel very real. I mistook those feelings for genuine depression before and thought i'd have to use psychedelics to get the meaning back in my life. Which then hugely backfired and caused me a 6 month depersonalized psychosis all while being on these existencialistic depressing withdrawal and while-high anxious feelings. Like holy shit wtf XD But yeah i remember a quote from Dennis McKenna from a Joe Rogan podcast where he says he gets emails of people saying like "You know life's been kinda strange lately, i took mushrooms 5 times last week..." and he says something along the lines of lay off the sauce, whatever it is that you're taking and see if THAT'S what is causing YOUR problems. Link: https://youtu.be/QcLa9IFQFak But yeah it has helped me. Not instantly because mentally i was in a pretty deep hole but i felt myself return more and more with each break i took.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>And whenever i oversmoke now and start to feel bad again i'll take a few days break or like a week and if that doesn't do it i'll just do a month and that will usually do it. At least the current data i have collected on myself would suggest that. But getting to this level of control took alot of time and work. I had to fail to moderate and lose control and slowly regain it to understand the importance of this. Never give up trying this. Was a real hassle but apparently worth it.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I personally found the sweetspot to be moderation, but yes you definitely have to quit to get rid of the dependency. Cannabis is relatively forgiving when it comes to that as quitting usually doesn't have any real harmful effects and withdrawals are just your brain readapting.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>So... last Thursday i wanted to stop. I didn't smoke on friday but felt urges and was unmotivated aswell on saturday. Then i smoked again because a friend wanted to. Then on sunday i was upset and really fighting with myself until letting go and saying "Fuck it" and just go crazy with the weed. Smoked ALOT and got really fucking high, so high even that i saw stars that weren't there, it's crazy. At the end of the day i felt like i could totally keep going like this but then thought "Nah lets end it tomorrow. Every relapse is part of the progress and maybe i need to be in the exact situation i will be tomorrow." So then next day i was really content and relaxed and didn't have any cravings. I did feel like "Yeah, smoking would be pretty awesome right now." but didn't really get to it and didn't really want to. At the end of the day, where cravings usually get the most intense and i the most lazy, i started becoming really hyperactive and suddenly wanted to do everything i usually do when sober. Work out, do music, play games, etc. And i didn't wanna smoke at all. Infact my head went, and still is going, so crazy and wild, i was so motivated, it almost got scary, even now, i don't know if i could handle any drugs rn. It feels like my brain is super charged and it's a little scary but i'll go with it and take this opportunity.</TEXT>

The deep dark existencialistic pits i fell into back when i thought i could smoke all the time and get away with it. I can! Binges are ok! But this plant is balanced. Which means i'll also pay the heavy price once i get off. I am paying for it right now actually! Been feeling it the last few days. It's crazy.

    <TEXT>Mate, i don't even know oroight. My brain is probably making all these fucken dissociation problems up because the human mind is most afraid of imagined fears. I dunno if i get high on placebo but honestly, i don't care because it feels bloody skitz and i save money so it's a double win for me. My weed is just pretty strong and i always put kief in. But i doubt it has anything to do with it. I probably just get high on panic or dissociation or something.</TEXT>
