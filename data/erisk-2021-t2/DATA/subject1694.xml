    <DATE>2020-08-13 18:50:41</DATE>
    <TEXT>can someone explain to my why my ps4 won't let me have my speeds i'm getting on my phone/xbox? I have done multiple speed tests and i get average of 65mb/down and 17mb/upload on a speed test on my phone. I have both a Xbox One X, and a PS4 Slim, they are both hooked up to a router extender via a Cat 7 ethernet cable My xbox gets close to these numbers on connection tests with around 49mbps/down, and 17mbps/upload in the settings. Yet, on my PS4 with the same exact ethernet wire, only 2 feet away from my xbox, hooked up to the same extender will only get me around 20mbps/down and an ABYSMAL 400kbps/upload. Both hooked up exactly the same way yet ps4 drastically poorer connection, does anyone have the same problem with a fix? or just an answer as to why this is?</TEXT>

    <TEXT>put that into perspective, so if you have had 7000 hours without burn in, then that means a user who uses an OLED for less that 6.5 hours a day, will have no problems with burn in for 3 years according to this info! great news! hopefully you get get upto 10,000!  #128561;</TEXT>

    <TITLE>LG OLED 55" CX 2 Questions about HDR/Dolby Vision, and Subtitles!!</TITLE>
    <DATE>2020-10-16 09:32:30</DATE>
    <TEXT>Q1: just bought the LG CX 55" primarly for gaming around 2/4 hours a day, can i play HDR/Dolby Vision games in full brightness and avoid burn in? or does anyone recommend a lower number to put brightness on while im HDR/DV to prolong the OLED's life/prevent burn in? Q2: when i'm not gaming on this tele, ill be watching netflix with Subtitles, should i be worried of burn in with subtitles? i can't really watch anything without them, will i be fine with normal usage? or should i change some settings to reduce the risk of burn in (if there is any) e.g. changing colour of subtitles so they're not white? Any answers are greatly appreciated!</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Thank you very much for taking the time to reply! Ok great! i'm happy about the subtitles cause i have heard a few horror stories regarding that lol! Ok thanks! i will make sure to use those settings on HDR and Dolby Vision, will using those settings decrease the life span on my OLED? most of the games i play are HDR compatible, so should i reduce the OLED light to preserve the panel? or should i just not listen to the horror stories???</TEXT>

    <TEXT>right! so since i've only recently changed my home xbox to his actual xbox one (so we can game share), you're saying that once i set up my XSX on Nov 10th with my account for the first time, it will set my XSX to my own home console, and so i would have to re-do the setting on my buddy's xbox one again due to XSX automatically setting itself up as my own home xbox?</TEXT>

    <TEXT>cheers for the reply! yes i am aware that if i were to sign into another (currently in use) xbox one that's already been through its initial set up with another account, that a newer account added will not be set to Home Console! I was wondering if a brand new initial set up of a new (out of the box) XSX will set the first account set up (in the initial set up) will be set as the Home Console? have you had any first hand experience with this?</TEXT>

    <TITLE>XSX Quick Resume!</TITLE>
    <DATE>2020-10-19 10:39:23</DATE>
    <TEXT>Hey Guys! I have seen a few videos on youtube/twitter regarding the Quick Resume feature. This one mainly from a Games Journalist 'Alanah Pearce' showing that after 24 hours being unplugged will still quick resume a game played a day before (even though console has been unplugged) - https://youtu.be/IcVW5QUEnLg I am presuming this XSX preview unit that Alanah is using has her power mode setting set to 'Instant On', which may explain why this feature works the way it did on the video! However, i am a user who uses the 'Power Saving' feature and so i don't reap the benefits of quick resuming a single game that XOX current has, and i will be using the same power mode (if available) on my XSX. My Question is, does anyone have any knowledge on whether this quick resume feature will work in the way this video makes out to be, on the 'Power Saving' mode? E.G. if jumping between avengers and DOOM Eternal *using quick resume* today on my XSX (in the future) with my 'Power Saving' mode enabled, then come to switch my XSX off at the end of the day. Will the Quick Resume feature work from a 'Power Saving' mode state? so when i turn on my XSX the next day (or few days later) will i be able to jump back into DOOM/Avengers from where i left off, WITHOUT using the 'Instant On' power mode? Cheers for anyone who has taken the time to read, and even bigger thanks to anyone who replies!  #128513;</TEXT>

    <TEXT>so this will work on the XSX regardless of which power mode i choose? would be a great thing for me! everyday i'm having to load up Avengers from start up instead of resuming where i left off which is a pain!</TEXT>
