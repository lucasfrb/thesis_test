    <TEXT>Thats's a tough situation to be in. I completely understand your point of view, as I would feel completely the same. Anyone who had molested someone or had sexually abused someone in the past, is something that I could never come to terms with and would definitely not be friends with that person. To be honest if your boyfriend really cares about you then he will do whatever it takes to make you feel comfortable. It is probably a question of whether his friendship with this person is more important to him than your relationship with each other. I think you should talk things over as considering your past experience with abuse (I am truly sorry that you had a traumatic experience and I know that it can truly hurt you from personal experience) it is clearly very important for you and I hope your boyfriend will understand that your feelings are worth taking into consideration.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Yes, you should be in an environment where you are safe and have the support from others. If your family are willing to ignore the fact that you had been a victim of abuse and still try to include that person in your life then they are clearly not looking out for you. It's hard to turn your back on your family but if it's the best thing for your well-being then I would do it.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I'm in the same situation at the moment. Whenever I feel slight happiness a shadow is cast upon it and I feel worthless again and end up harming myself. I've been having so many breakdowns lately because I don't really know how I can feel better about myself and about life in general. Mental health sucks. Currently going to be turning 19 soon and have been having suicidal thoughts since I had been 15. Lately the urge has become stronger because I feel like I have nothing to live for and I keep going aroung in circles with self-harm and my issues seem to be getting worse by the day. I try to stay strong sometimes and tell myself that it will get better and I that I will find my purpose in life but my hope is fading away.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I been angry for years too so completely understand where you're coming from. No matter how hard I try I always end up fucking things up and getting so pissed off at myself. I used to hit myself all the time and hit my head against walls/anything solid. I've literally become so used to my anger that I can't imagine living without it. Maybe find an outlet for your anger. I have been advised to take up boxing so many times which I am still yet to do. Or maybe start to learn an instrument, that helps me when I'm angry. Playing the guitar can be very soothing.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Feel for you man. Had depression since 15 and now I'm 19 and currently at uni. It's the worst shit ever. There are times where I just shut myself in my room and don't talk to anyone. It's quite hard to avoid people though since I'm in shared accomodation, but at least I have my own room and only share the kitchen and bathroom areas. Maybe you should reach out to someone, it doesn't have to be therapy. Personally, I don't think therapy helped in anyway but I was literally forced to go because I was on the verge of getting kicked out of uni if I wasn't going to improve. Still, I refuse to go and been keeping more to myself now which probably isn't a good idea because I've been self-harming a lot and been suicidal lately. You need to find something that helps, even if it's just talking to a friend. Sometimes I just end up writing shit down when I'm really depressed and it helps a bit. It's frustrating though, I understand.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>It's so hard to dig yourself out of that hole. Lately I feel like I've lost all hope at life and I really struggle to convince myself to live. Same here, at our uni someone committed suicide recently. It just makes you realise how short life really is. I think most people take life for granted (me included.) I try to stay positive at times but it doesn't last long and then I become withdrawn and sucidal again. I feel like I have no friends as well, which makes me upset, then I just become self-destructive because I think that no one will give a shit about what happens to me anyway.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Sorry to hear what you had been through, it must have been so difficult. You shouldn't be forced to mantain a relationship with your step-brother if you're not comfortable with it. At the end of the day he abused you and doesn't have any right to be involved in your life since he caused trauma to it. Your actions are completely the right thing to do, as if I was in your position I would do the exact same thing. If you are concerned about your daughter's safety then you should take all measures to protect her. It's completely your choice who is allowed to have your daughter's pictures. Your step-brother (abuser) has no right to comfront you because he was the one in the wrong when he abused you in the past. I would just completely ignore him and if need be take measures to ensure that you are safe. The fact that your parents are indenial with what your step-brother had done to you just proves that they are trying to make your life toxic. No one should ignore abuse no matter who is involved.</TEXT>

I seem to shut down friendships all the time because I have so many fucked up mental problems and I have issues with close relationships ( friends/family). Also I keep messing everything up, had so many warnings about being kicked out of uni and at this rate feel like I'm going to fail my exams. I've been suicidal for a number of years but it's got to a point where I can't do anything right in my life and nothing seems to be improving, so sometimes I think what's the point even trying to fix things when I'll end up messing them up again.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Same here, I've been suffering from mental illness for a long time now and it never gets better. I feel like I don't even have 'good days' anymore, like everything is just pointless and I have breakdowns all of the time. It's so hard to struggle and go through the same shit everyday when I know that I've hit a wall and nothing is going to change. Families are always affected though, and especailly if I had a child I wouldn't want to hurt them and make their life a misery knowing that their parent is gone. Maybe try to spend more time with your daughter to keep you preoccupied and see what you would miss out on.</TEXT>

I know one day I'm going to commit suicide because I've been suicidal since 15 and the urge gets stronger all the time. For me suicide almost feels 'normal' because I've been hurting for so long and it's the hardest thing to carry on with an empty life. I'm constantly SH (even twice today) and that's what gets me through the day. I cry almost everyday, because I want to feel better but I know that it's not possible and that I'm slowly fading away. Thinking of my mum makes me upset because I don't want her to suffer from my actions.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Same here. I do this thing where I just completely shut down from people and ignore their messages and calls. I don't do it on purpose but I think it's just a reaction from me not being okay. I have so much shit to deal with and things get too much for me, so pushing people away and shutting down is probably the way I tell people that I'm not okay. My friends message me asking if I'm okay and that we should hang out soon, and I get upset because my problems always seem to take over and then I lose friendships. I'm hurting so much inside and people don't notice how bad it gets. When people tell me all the time that things are going to get better it frustrates me because I know that I always go through the same cycle and things never seem to be alright.</TEXT>

Same, I used to be able to having a lasting friendship before my life went to shit and I haven't been able to maintain friendships for a number of years now.

People keep telling me that it's going to get better which breaks my heart even more because they don't get it. I'm sick of acting like I'm actually improving but it's better than explaining to people that I've hit rock bottom once again. I think I'm so used to deceiving people by now, that it;s just the norm for me. Sorry to hear about your dog, it's so hard to let go of a pet.

It's not that I don't like both places but things just get too much for me and running away always comes to mind and feels like the ideal way to deal with my issues. Any advice/supportive messages</TEXT>

    <TEXT>The only reason I smile is so that people don't constantly ask me what's the matter. I think it's just a lot of things that build up. I have a lot of trust issues and I never tend to stay in a friendship for long and I feel like I'm always a burden. I want to do my degree but at the same time it doesn't matter for me because I know that I will die soon anyway. Things just get worse rather than better.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Saw your post and so glad someone else has experienced this. I'm at home for summer now but when I was at uni I self harmed a lot, basically on a daily basis and multiple times a day. During this period I hardly ate because I didnt want to see anyone so I wouldn't go to the kitchen. I just didn't want anyone so see my arms covered in bandages and I felt very self-conscious. I wore long sleeves but it was noticeable that there was something wrong so I didn't want people asking me questions. I wouldn't leave my room unless to go to the bathroom because I didn't want people to see me like this. Now that I'm at home, I have still been self-harming but I eat because its my family so its different. They don't know that I self harm but it doesn't feel as patronising.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Personally I don't know anyone else who does the same shit I do, but I'm so glad its not only me. I feel like people would think I'm even more fucked up if I tell them that I don't leave my room for days. I do the same thing where I just eat whatever I have in my room so I can avoid people when I'm at my lowest point in life. It gets so bad that I have to check whether anyone else is in the kitchen before going in because I don't want to interact with them. When I have nothing to eat in my room I can go through days starving because in my mind I can't leave to get food because I would panic that someone will notice that something is up.</TEXT>

Its such a hard question to answer when you're not in a good place and you want to have minimal contact with people. Normally my personal hygiene is good, which is probably the only thing that I'm good at maintaining. But yeah it can get bad when I don't leave my room and haven't got the will to do anything.</TEXT>

Even if I become happier one day , I know that I will never be OK because I've been hurting for so long and no matter how much therapy that I get I will end up killing myself one day. My whole life just revolves around self-destruction. I ruin everything all the time and I don't really care that I do because I've given up on life a long time ago and I'm only still here to show that I might be coping. Its just the same repetitive shit everyday. I'm fed up of life and feeling like shit all of the time.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I push people away as well and fuck up relationships. Luckily my friends are loyal and accept the issues that I have. Its really hard to stop being so self-destructive and I just hope that I will stop at a point in my life where I'm more comfortable with the issues that I have and can cope better. To be honest, I would just say explain to your friends and family and hope that they will understand in some way. But people don't understand that having depression and BPD is really hard because there are times where I cannot control what I do, its sort of an impulse.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Pretty much in the same boat. Have really bad insomnia but I #8217;m kinda used to it since I #8217;ve had it for the past five years. My depression had gone from bad to worse within a matter of weeks. Struggled a lot last year at university from personal issues but also I felt like I didn #8217;t fit in there and didn #8217;t really have a circle of friends that I could rely on or talk to when I was feeling down. Been suicidal for a while but never have the guts to completely go through with it. I feel like I just need someone who I can vent out to if I #8217;m angry or sad. I get very emotional which makes me feel that people don #8217;t like me so I tend to isolate myself. I haven #8217;t been happy for a long time but I try to go through each day.

    <TEXT>Thank you. The thing I really struggle with is buying things online. Since having a credit card I buy clothes and things online rather than going in the shop. For me I find I buy things impulsively when I #8217;ve had a really bad day and then I look at things online to cheer myself up. Sometimes but rarely I #8217;m able to put things in the basket and leave it. I feel like I shouldn #8217;t own a credit card so that I won #8217;t be able to buy things online. I know it #8217;s a work in progress. I generally feel bad afterwards when buying something that I don #8217;t need.</TEXT>

Been in a amp;e twice, almost got sectioned by police and they did a welfare check on me at home. Well basically been getting worse with depression lately and self harming, and self harmed quite badly so had to call an ambulance twice and police attended too. When police did a welfare check I wasn #8217;t at home so my mum answered and spoke to them. Anyways she #8217;s pissed off at me saying why I #8217;m doing this and that it #8217;s all for attention and I need to grow up. Fuck sake! Like I have a choice to be mentally ill, I wish I wasn #8217;t and I could live a normal happy life but clearly I can #8217;t. Thinking bout moving out now or if I don #8217;t and I end up having more mental breakdowns like this my mum said she #8217;s going to kick me out. I hate her. Hate my life, and I definitely won #8217;t be able to stand this anymore.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Whenever I have a severe depressive episode I won #8217;t eat for like 3 days or more. I won #8217;t be able to physically eat as I have no appetite. I feel like I #8217;m struggling more with eating now than I have been before. Any tips on how to eat more?</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I know what happened was wrong and it #8217;s messed me up pretty bad, but in some ways I miss the attention that came with it. He treated me like nobody had treated me before, made me smile and made me feel special. I would never want to go through that again but nothing comes close to the attention that I had got. I #8217;m almost 20, never been in a proper relationship because I #8217;m too scared and too protective over myself. I want to have close groups of friends also but I isolate myself and tell myself that I #8217;m not worthy. I #8217;m so self sabotaging because as soon as I have the opportunity to date someone or become close with someone I ignore the person and lock myself away from everyone. I #8217;m so empty and I lack any sort of friends or partners.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I #8217;ve had depression for 5 years and I never thought that it would take all my friends away from me. As my depression had gotten worse as the years go by, I have become more and more lonely and all my friendships have faded. I have no one to hang out with and talk to. I #8217;m 20 years old (almost) and people keep telling me this should be the happiest time of your life, but my life is a misery. I #8217;m surprised how I manage to get through each day with no one beside me. I want to be able to go out and have a good time but I can #8217;t even try because I have no one to go and do things with. There #8217;s only so much time that you can spend on your own without having the need to have human contact. I #8217;m becoming more delusional and paranoid as time goes by.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I completely understand sometimes I feel like we put too much pressure on ourselves in order to change these so called bad habits. It can be overwhelming to change so drastically without small steps so sometimes I manage to tell myself that I need to take it easy and stop stressing out. I struggle with brushing teeth as well but showering is definitely the worst. I find that listening to music while showering calms me down and makes me feel as it #8217;s not such a big task to do. It definitely helps even when I try to force myself to shower, listening to music uplifts my mood. I #8217;ve never tried showering without the lights on, personally I don #8217;t think it would work with me, but I #8217;m open to new ideas. Thank you for your support, and stay strong!</TEXT>

    <TEXT>F 20 Same here. I #8217;ve struggled with depression throughout my teen years and I still struggle now. I #8217;ve lost all my friends and either I can #8217;t be bothered to make new ones or I just know that I will end up loosing them so there #8217;s no point. I have interests but I #8217;m never able to pursue them for long which makes me upset, it #8217;s so frustrating because people my age are having the time of their lives and I #8217;m not doing anything and I know that I #8217;m going to be alone forever. I understand completely, it #8217;s so hard to move on to the next chapter of your life since depression practically ruined the most important years. All I can say is stay strong and try get out there more ( something I should tell myself) and hopefully you will be in a happier place where you can enjoy yourself. It #8217;s going to be tough though, the world is a scary place especially if you don #8217;t have friends. First step is to make new friends through mutual interests or maybe reopen past friendships. All the best! X</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I have so many problems and have had severe depression for the last five years. I #8217;m working and still living with my mum but I was at uni for a year, then was forced to take a year out due to mental health issues. I haven #8217;t talked to my mum at all about my issues and haven #8217;t had therapy since I #8217;ve left uni. I want to go back to uni but I know it will be a risk because I may become more depressed and destructive like before. I want to get back into education but I know that my mental health will affect it as I have highs and lows all the time for the past five years.

    <TITLE>Advice on anti- depressants</TITLE>
    <DATE>2020-09-17 23:54:13</DATE>
    <TEXT>Hi Everyone, I've had depression on and off for the past 5 years but I have never been on anti-depressants. Partially because I haven't had much contact with mental health teams and also whenever anti- depressants were mentioned, I always said that I would refuse to take them. Well, I'm seeing a new private psychiatrist and I'm pretty sure that he will prescribe me some medication. I'm very skeptical about that and I just wanted to get some advice from anyone that has used anti-depressants in the past or presently. I am concerned about side effects or if they even help, since I've read that they can have adverse/negative affects. Let me know your thoughts, thank you.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>That's great to hear that you have had a positive experience with medication. I feel like now I'm more open to trying some sort of medication to help with my mental health issues, but I'm just very cautious and quite anxious because I'm not sure how they will make me feel. But I've got to a point where my mental health has slightly improved over the past 6 months, however the last couple of years have been really bad and my mental health worsened to a point where I was suicidal and not sure whether I was going to pull through it. I don't want to go back to that state though.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I can #8217;t help myself when it comes to overspending. It #8217;s definitely one of my worse traits. I used to spend a lot of money on clothes and shoes but I have stopped doing that and that hasn #8217;t happened in several months, which I am really proud of. I don #8217;t even go online to browse. However, I #8217;ve spent  #163;600 within the last two weeks, which is excessive for me. Okay some of it has been on therapy, which is definitely usual and something that I need. I have also spent a lot of that money on food like takeout where I #8217;ve just been too lazy to go to the shop and go grocery shopping so that I can cook myself something. I tell myself that it #8217;s not a problem though since I #8217;m spending money on food which is a necessity. I hate having to justify my spending though and I can #8217;t help myself from spending too much money. This is really bad, I #8217;m going to end up in debt at some point which I really don #8217;t want. DAE have advice on spending?</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Sometimes I will just buy food unnecessarily, like even if I have cooked something, I will still end up buying food afterwards. I do try to stop myself from buying larger portions when ordering takeout, which does sometimes work. Yeah if I listen to music I find it much easier to be able to cook something. I struggle to get myself into the kitchen in order to cook which is annoying, I'm not sure why this happens to be honest. When I'm in the kitchen and start preparing food then I will go through with cooking. Sounds like a good idea, I will buy some snacks to reward myself with and see if that helps. Thank you for the advice and support, and hope you are doing well.</TEXT>

    <TITLE>Lied to my psychiatrist about my SH</TITLE>
    <DATE>2020-10-05 23:30:15</DATE>
    <TEXT>So basically, I told my psychiatrist that I hadn #8217;t self harmed since January this year, which was true at the time when I saw him. However that was mid September and between then and now I have self harmed more than 5 times through burning and cutting. I spoke to him like a week ago and didn #8217;t mention anything because I don #8217;t want him to know. I feel like I might be getting into this pattern of self harming again. Even though it may not be as bad as before where I used to self harm constantly throughout the day and night, I don #8217;t think it #8217;s a good thing for me to get back into doing it because I know soon it will consume me again and I don #8217;t want that to happen. I kinda want to keep it a secret though but I #8217;m afraid that if I end up in a amp;e then he will find out as well as other people.</TEXT>

I understand the ups and downs with this disorder is constant which is extremely frustrating. That was exactly me in my late teens I started to realise something is definitely not right. I mean I had severe depression but I knew it had to be something else. I know right at least with the diagnosis of bpd I actually can justify why I #8217;m the way I am with relationships especially. I mean having the answer is a relief but how to live with it is still a struggle. I used to say that I hated people but I just have a lot of trust issues which affects everything.

I hate crying for no reason and if someone is there trying to explain to them why I #8217;m crying when I don #8217;t know myself. I hate having no friends and no prospects of ever having a relationship. I hate being so self destructive that it can potentially ruin my life by actions which are impulsive and which make me feel like shit afterwards. I hate having to explain to people why I am the way I am, why I can #8217;t have close friends or intimate relationships, why I seem to fuck up just about anything and ruin any good chances that come my way. I hate having to frequently go to the emergency room for self harming and getting asked why I do it. I hate the fact that whenever I have an injury, cut or bruise that wasn #8217;t caused by self harming, that I have to try and convince that individual or group of people what had happened. I hate my life. I #8217;m getting worse and that scares me. I am dissociating more than ever and nothing seems real anymore.

    <TEXT>So spoke to my psychiatrist today because my therapist said that I should consider medication.

So he said that medication wouldn #8217;t be good for me considering my circumstances.

    <DATE>2020-10-16 02:27:20</DATE>
    <TEXT>So I went to the hospital on Monday with self harm injuries and I was eventually taken to the observation ward that they have there. Within 10 minutes I went to the bathroom and had a blade on me and attempted to self harm again, the door was forced open by security and the nurses were just standing there. Was trying to leave because I was so angry, I mean I was a complete mess I wasn #8217;t thinking straight at all, but was restrained by security and they took the blade off me. I #8217;m not surprised that they sectioned me looking back at it, but at the time I was pissed off with them and I attempted to leave several times but failed. I was then watched continuously by security when I was sitting down and then when I got up to go to the toilet etc. I don #8217;t even know what happened, I feel like the past number of days are a complete blur to me, I mean I ended up in hospital three times in a row, the first time I left and the police was contacted so they took me back. They I was discharged and went home, within a couple hours I was back in a amp;e and then was sectioned and they kept me for a further two days. I don #8217;t know anymore what to do, I really don #8217;t trust myself. I mean before I used to self harm a lot more consistently, but I feel like now when I do self harm it #8217;s more severe and I have episodes of self harm that can last up to four days or so, but the consequences are much worse than before. I didn #8217;t even register that I was sectioned, I didn #8217;t even react when they told me. I think I #8217;ve lost the battle and I #8217;m not really sure how that happened.</TEXT>

He said the only way that I will improve or get better in a sense is through intensive therapy.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>It was so strange, it was like I reached a completely different level. I #8217;ve never been that bad, it was like it wasn #8217;t even reality, it didn #8217;t sink in until like a day later where I was and what had happened. I feel like I #8217;m losing my shit a lot more now and I will not remember like 3 days, where I #8217;m so destructive and impulsive. I act like nothing even happened. It #8217;s so frustrating, I mean I thought I was getting better but clearly not. Thank you  #128153; Hope you #8217;re doing okay too, all the best</TEXT>

    <TEXT>That #8217;s what he said, at the moment my mood is so shit and I #8217;m very unpredictable. He also said that if he did prescribe meds, he would think that I would likely take an overdose, he definitely doesn #8217;t trust me at the moment with how I #8217;m behaving.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I mean I #8217;m definitely unpredictable there #8217;s no doubt about that, I don #8217;t even trust myself. But I mean I wouldn #8217;t OD, I #8217;ve never done that before and I #8217;m not suicidal I #8217;m just a mess and on the edge, but I #8217;m like that all of the time.</TEXT>
