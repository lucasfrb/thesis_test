Wilt, he states that in 1943 after the disarming of Italian troops in Southern France that the 41,057 troops who remained "were separated into three groups.The first were those volunteering for service in the Wehrmacht (Kampfwillige or Arbeitswillige),those volunteering for construction or supply work but not in the military (Hilfswillige),and those who did not want to fight or work for the Germans (Militaringternierte).The Nazi authorities considered the" Militaringternierte" or interned as military prisoners and sent 10,225 of them to work in the armament factories."</TEXT>

The image was taken by the waist gunner aboard Woodson #8217;s B-17 who coaxed the P-51 closer in order to take the image. Woodson stated:  #8216;We were hit by flak on the bomb run and lost an engine. A second engine was giving trouble and would not keep up with the formation. We suddenly felt very alone in the skies over Germany. Called the fighter channel on the radio and miraculously a lovely P-51 showed up on our wing in a surprisingly short time. We knew his wing man was above flying cover so we began to relax. A waist gunner had a 35mm camera with color film- a WWII rarity. We coaxed the P-51 closer and closer and this is the picture that resulted. It still brings a lump to my throat when I look at it. #8217;</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Italian battleship Giulio Cesare Early in World War II, the ship took part in the Battle of Calabria (also known as the Battle of Punto Stilo), together with Conte di Cavour, on 9 July 1940, as part of the 1st Battle Squadron, commanded by Admiral Inigo Campioni, during which she engaged major elements of the British Mediterranean Fleet. The British were escorting a convoy from Malta to Alexandria, while the Italians had finished escorting another from Naples to Benghazi, Libya. Admiral Andrew Cunningham, commander of the Mediterranean Fleet, attempted to interpose his ships between the Italians and their base at Taranto. Crew on the fleets spotted each other in the middle of the afternoon and the battleships opened fire at 15:53 at a range of nearly 27,000 meters (29,000 yd). The two leading British battleships, HMS Warspite and Malaya, replied a minute later. Three minutes after she opened fire, shells from Giulio Cesare began to straddle Warspite which made a small turn and increased speed, to throw off the Italian ship's aim, at 16:00. Some rounds fired by Giulio Cesare overshot Warspite and near-missed the destroyers HMS Decoy and Hereward, puncturing their superstructures with splinters. At that same time, a shell from Warspite struck Giulio Cesare at a distance of about 24,000 meters (26,000 yd). The shell pierced the rear funnel and detonated inside it, blowing out a hole nearly 6.1 meters (20 ft) across. Fragments started several fires and their smoke was drawn into the boiler rooms, forcing four boilers off-line as their operators could not breathe. This reduced the ship's speed to 18 knots (33 km/h; 21 mph). Uncertain how severe the damage was, Campioni ordered his battleships to turn away in the face of superior British numbers and they successfully disengaged. Repairs to Giulio Cesare were completed by the end of August and both ships unsuccessfully attempted to intercept British convoys to Malta in August and September. On the night of 11 November 1940, Giulio Cesare and the other Italian battleships were at anchor in Taranto harbor when they were attacked by 21 Fairey Swordfish torpedo bombers from the British aircraft carrier HMS Illustrious, along with several other warships. One torpedo sank Conte di Cavour in shallow water, but Giulio Cesare was not hit during the attack. She participated in the Battle of Cape Spartivento on 27 November 1940, but never got close enough to any British ships to fire at them. The ship was damaged in January 1941 by splinters from a near miss during an air raid on Naples by Vickers Wellington bombers of the Royal Air Force; repairs at Genoa were completed in early February. On 8 February, she sailed from to the Straits of Bonifacio to intercept what the Italians thought was a Malta convoy, but was actually a raid on Genoa. She failed to make contact with any British forces. She participated in the First Battle of Sirte on 17 December 1941, providing distant cover for a convoy bound for Libya, and briefly engaging the escort force of a British convoy. She also provided distant cover for another convoy to North Africa in early January 1942. Giulio Cesare was reduced to a training ship afterwards at Taranto and later Pola. After the Italian surrender on 9 September 1943, she steamed to Taranto, putting down a mutiny and enduring an ineffective attack by five German aircraft en route. She then sailed for Malta where she arrived on 12 September to be interned. The ship remained there until 17 June 1944 when she returned to Taranto where she remained for the next four years</TEXT>

    <TEXT>This is the 93rd Infantry Division on Bougainville. Not truck drivers. The division's combat elements moved to Bougainville Island on 28 March 1944, and were attached to the Americal Division on the 30th. On that date they entered combat, assisting in attacks on the enemy perimeter. These elements, including the 25th RCT, reconnoitered across the Laruma River on 2 April, and in the Torokina River Valley from 7 #8211;12 April 1944. The 25th RCT operated against the Japanese along the Kuma and East-West Trails during May 1944. The combat team left for the Green Islands during May and June. The 93d Rcn. Troop, attached to the XIV Corps, remained to raid, patrol, and maintain perimeter positions. The troop began training 12 September 1944, and moved to Finschhafen on 1 November. Security patrols had scattered contacts with the enemy at Urapas from 3 to 15 January 1945, at Wardo from 6 November-22 December, and at Wari on 31 December. The security detachments at Wardo and Wari were withdrawn on 9 #8211;10 February 1945. Leonard E. Dowden While on Jolo on 17 July 1945, a patrol from the 368th was ambushed by a Japanese force three times its size. When the firefight began, Sergeant Leonard E. Dowden moved his squad to within 30 yards of the enemy. He then crawled forward alone to assault a machine-gun position with grenades, despite being gravely wounded. He would be killed by a burst of fire as he was about to throw a grenade. The patrol was able to fight off the enemy attack with only 18 casualties. For the extraordinary heroism that cost him his life, Staff Sergeant Dowden received the Distinguished Service Cross. Originally from New Orleans, Louisiana, Staff Sergeant Dowden was the only member of the 93rd Infantry Division to earn the DSC during the war "</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Decided to repost this, Brewster Buffalo on Crete and the Middle East. 805 Squadron formed Feb 1941 with 12 Fairey Fulmar two-seat fighters, carrier capable, to support a planned invasion of Rhodes, off the coast of Turkey, held by Italians. Squadron leader Lt Cmdr Alan Black, Fleet Air Arm. Based at Maleme in northeastern Crete. Three Buffaloes (AS419, AS420, AX814) along with 6 more Fulmars flew in from Dekheila (?) March 6. The Buffalo flight commanded by Lt. Rupert Brabner, formerly Member of Parliament for Hyth. The Brewsters were equipped with an antique post-and-ring sight, proof that they were Belgian 339Bs rather than the British 339E model. Black: "The Buffalo was a delight to fly--very maneuverable (compared to the Fulmar). It would have been an excellent fighter but the guns could not be fired because the ends of the wires which were part of the interrupter gear, failed and 805 did not have the necessary spares." He does not explain what happened to the two .50-cal wing guns. Evidently there was a story abroad that Black thought so little of the Brewstger that he tried to swap them for Gloster biplane fighters, for he added: "At no time did I request that the Buffalos [sic] be exchanged for Sea Gladiators, but I do remember that in the light of the inadequacy of Fulmars against CR43s I requested that the Sea Gladiators, if not required for other operations, should be send to Maleme, to reinforce 805." (p141) March 18, Lt. Brabner had his first skirmish, chasing a Ju88 without catching it--while flying a Fulmar, perhaps indicative of his opinion of the Buffalo. He was up again next day, mounted on AS419, only to turn back because of engine trouble. He crash- landed short of the airfield, and the Brewster flipped over on its back, fortunately without injury to the MP. A photograph shows it resting very sturdily on its plexiglass canopy--an evident tribute to Dayton Brown's roll-bar. That seems to have been the Brewster's only sortie from Crete. In the British Order of Battle on April 5, 805 Squadron is shown only as having Fulmars and Sea Gladiators on strength, and by the end of April: "The two remaining Buffalos were also totally unservicable now." When German paratroopers over-ran Crete at the end of May, the Brewsters were apparently left in the boneyard. German photographers delighted in photographing their planes landing over the hulk of a derelict Brewster.</TEXT>

The photograph was probably taken before the invasion of Malaya, as the obsolete torpedo-bombers of Nos 36 and 100 Squadrons RAF did not make any torpedo attacks during the campaign. Surprisingly successful at night bombing, they were decimated in the daylight raid on Endau on 26 January 1942.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>The Deutsche-Arabische Lehr Abteilung was formed in July 1941 in Sonium, Greece, by Sonderstab F and was made up of Arab volunteers, mainly former POWs from the British and French armies. The unit suffered from the power struggle between Hadji Muhammed Amin Al-Hussein, the Mufti of Jerusalem, and Rashid Ai Al-Gailani, ex-Prime Minister of Iraq, that was waged over the Arabs in the unit. It became part of Sonderverband 287 in 1942. It was sent to the Caucasus region in September 1942 for the planned invasion of the Arab lands, there it saw action against the Red Army before being sent to Palermo, Italy, in November. It was sent to Tunisia, January 1943, where it was used to recruit Arabs for auxiliary units to be used either for guard duty or as construction troops. These units were equipped with Vichy French uniforms and rifles. It was captured along with the rest of the Axis forces in Africa in May 1943. The elements not sent to North Africa was used to form Deutsche-Arabische Bataillon Nr 845.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Dire Dawa, Somalia, August 1940: Italian fighters Fiat CR.32 taking off during the operations against the Somaliland started on 3 August when the Italian troops went the borders advancing without strong resistance. At the start of the operations the Italian East Africa #8217;s Air Force deployed for the attack a total of 85 airplanes: 51 bombers (19 S.81 of the Gruppi 4th and 29th, 11 S.79 of the 44th Gruppo and 21 old Ca.133 of the 27th Gruppo), 25 fighters (nine CR.32 and 16 CR.42 of the Squadriglie 410th, 411th and 413rd, afterwards grouped into a single Gruppo) and nine observation planes Ro.37bis of the 110th Squadriglia. The bombers was committed mainly against harbor of Aden and Berbera (this last was conquered by Italians on 19 August) and some airfield as Hargheisa, Burao and La Feruk. The RAF #8217;s forces in this sector were quite weak, the main was deployed for the Aden #8217;s defence, and the reaction wasn #8217;t that envisaged by the Italians. A report wrote by the Air Vice Marshal Air Officer Commanding British Forces Aden attached to General Archibald Wavell #8217;s report, General Officer Commanding-in-Chief of Middle East Command, posted to Wavell to the Secretary of State for War on 12 September 1941, highlighted the local air superiority of the Italian Air Force. Afterwards the latter was committed on the close air support to land forces until the end of the campaign. In this missions was employed also the CR.32s with bomb racks under the bottom wing with two 50kg bombs. During this brief campaign, the Italian East Africa #8217;s Air Force flew 935 hours in war missions: 376 for bomb missions, 204 for fighters missions and 355 for recce missions with the loss in action of 4 aircraft (two S.81, one CR.32 and one S.79) and of 20 men (KIA and MIA): six officers, two NCO and twelve privates claiming five enemy planes destroyed in aerial combat and nine on the ground. The Italian claims was in part confirmed by the Reid #8217;s report: seven RAF aircraft destroyed, ten heavily damaged with the loss of 12 men KIA or MIA from the 5 until 19 August.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Between December 1942 and February 1943, the Aeron #195; #161;utica Militar (Army Military Aviation) obtained aircraft operated by the 81st and the 350th Fighter Groups originally dispatched to North Africa as part of Operation Torch. Due to several problems en route, some of the aircraft were forced to land in Portugal and Spain. Of the 19 fighter aircraft that landed in Portugal, all were interned and entered service that year with the Portuguese Army Military Aviation. Though unnecessary, the Portuguese Government paid the United States US$20,000 for each of these interned aircraft as well as for one interned P-38 Lightning. The US accepted the payment, and gave as a gift four additional crates of aircraft, two of which were not badly damaged, without supplying spares, flight manuals or service manuals. Lacking proper training, incorporation of the aircraft into service was plagued with problems, and the last six Portuguese Airacobras that remained in 1950 were sold for scrap.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>The German blockade runner Elbe is burning in the Atlantic Ocean after a bomb hit during an attack by British carrier aircraft. The cargo ship Elbe was built in 1929 at the Deutsche Werke Kiel AG for the Norwegian shipping company under the original name of Sud Expreso. Subsequently, the vessel changed names and owners several times, until in 1934 it was purchased by Norddeutscher Lloyd. After that the ship was modernized: a new machine installation was delivered. The beginning of the war caught the Elbe in the Japanese port of Yokohama. In 1941, the ship was converted into a blockade runner for a voyage from Japan to Germany occupied by western France. On April 20, 1941, Elbe left Dairen ( #22823; #36899; / Dairen, now Dalian) and became the third German blockade runner after Ermland and the prize tanker Ole Jacob, who completed the supply mission for the Kriegsmarine. On June 6, 1941, a ship laden with rubber, disguised as a Norwegian steamer, was found to the northwest of the islands of Cape Verde (Cape Verde) by an aircraft from HMS Eagle, who was searching for the Bismarck and the Prinz Eugen. The Elbe did not give any answers to the signals from the plane and made an attempt to leave at full speed. a Swordfish from 824 Naval Air Squadron) sank it. On June 21, 1941 HMS Hilary picked up 19 surviving members of the blockaderunner.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Geschwader Bongart "Named Geschwader Bongart by the name of its commander, Oberst Hermann-Josef Freiherr von dem Bongart, the FL/ZG2 was a specialized anti-partisan unit formed in April 1944 at Bourges and from May 1944 was employed in regions with heavy partisan activity like Lyon, Valence, Clermont-Ferrand, Avord and Bourges and disbanded in September 1944 after the move Northwards of France following the Allied landing on Southern France (August 1944). The Fliegerzielgeschwader 2 operated, from different airfields, a variety of aircrafts including the Re.2002s delivered directly by Reggiane or former Italian Air Force #8217;s planes commandeered by Luftwaffe. The Italian plane was the most important aircraft of the FL/ZG2 with on June 1944 had a fleet of 35 Re.2002s. In the July the Geschwader, from various airfields, undertook 482 sorties against the Maquis, the French partisans, as well 45 on a day (11 July). During this month the Geschwader Bongart took part in a great operation against some 10,000 French partisans on the Vercors Plateau, South of Grenoble, surrounded and destroyed in a combined operation by air and land forces. On 21, during this operations, the Geschwader Bongart, 44 sorties in a day, provided cover for 22 gliders landed on the massif south of Grenoble. The Re.2002s, along with other Luftwaffe aircraft, dropped a total of 7.5 tons of bombs. The next day the Geschwader Bongart flew 68 sorties, 63 on 23 July, 20 on 24 July, 32 on 25 July, 18 on 26 July. In the same time many airports of the area used by Germans were bombed by Allies and some aircraft was destroyed. On the first days of August the Geschwader had still 32 fighter-bomber but only 14 serviceable. On 4 September 1944 the Geschwader Bongart was disbanded at Luxeil because, after the Allied landings in Southern France in August, the Geschwader could no longer operate due to the total Allied air superiority over all of France. After the disbandment of his unit in September 1944, Oberstleutnant Bongart  #8211; previously commander of IV./KG55 (10 June-1 September 1941), commander of III./KG.55, from 1943 on the staff of Luftflotte 3 as the Offizier f #252;r Sonderauftr #228;ge (special projects officer)  #8211; became Kommandant of Neum #252;nster Airfield in Schleswig-Holstein. Bongart passed away on 21 December 1952."</TEXT>

    <TEXT>" Schilling was a Rube Goldberg-like inventor who once built a weapon described as "a cross between a machine gun and a pistol." David C. Schilling The third-ranking ace of the 56th Fighter Group, Col. Schilling achieved 22.5 air victories, plus 10.5 destroyed on the ground in his 132 combat sorties. Most of Schilling's victories were against Bf-109 and FW-190 single-engined fighters excepting one Me-110 and one Me-410 twin-engined destroyers. Schilling had 5 air victories in one mission, downing 2 Bf-109s and 3 FW-190s on December 23, 1944 plus multiple victories on four other missions. A P-47 pilot, he flew a presentation aircraft "Hewlett/Woodmere Long Island," decorated with "Hairless Joe," a Dogpatch cartoon character. Born December 15, 1919, Leavenworth, Kansas. Attended Dartmouth College, New Hampshire. Enlisted USAAC and accepted for pilot training, 1939. Commissioned 2nd Lt. in Air Reserves, May 1940. 8th Pursuit Group at Langley, Virginia and later Mitchel Field, New York. 56th FG at Charlotte AB, North Carolina, June 1941. To Europe with 62nd FS/56th FG, Jan. 1943. Promoted to Major, C.O. 62nd FS. He participated in the first pre-operational 'circus' over Pas-de-Calais in April 8, 1943. On a late April mission, his plane was hit, knocking out his radio, but he returned without difficulty. He led many missions during this period, such as a fighter sweep over Ypres May 25 and a 'rodeo' of 4 fighter groups on August 23. He was made Group Executive Officer in August 1943. He opened his scoring on October 2, 1943, downing a Bf-109 and an FW-190. Two days later, on a very big day for the 56th, he led a counter-attack on some Bf-110s as they tried to attack the B-17s, knocking down one himself. November 26 was another very successful day, the Group claiming 23 on a withdrawal support mission form Bremen; Schilling getting two 190s. Promoted to Lt. Colonel. Acting C.O. 56th FG, Jan. 11-19, 1944 (during Hub Zemke's absence). He continued his scoring throughout 1944, getting 3 FW-190s on September 21. After Zemke's capture, Schilling served as Group C.O. from Aug. 12, 1944 through Jan. 27, 1945. His highest scoring day was December 23, 1944, during the Battle of the Bulge, when he downed 3 Bf-109s and 2 FW-190s in a huge dogfight with over 100 German fighters. Decorations: Distinguished Service Cross with OLC, Silver Star with 2 OLC, Distinguished Flying Cross with 8 OLC, Air Medal with (?) OLC, British DFC, Croix de Guerre Returned to USA and later C.O. of post-war 56th FG. Brought the 56th FG's P-80 jet fighters to the UK on the first USAF Trans-Atlantic Jet Flight, July 1948.

    <TEXT>The aft part of the cabin ("winter garden") of the U 889 with a paired 3.7-cm semi-automatic anti-aircraft gun on the LM42U carriage, which is equipped with folding 15-mm protective shields on the sides. This powerful weapon was tested in May 1944 on U 1164 at the VII Anti-Aircraft School in Swinem #252;nde and from October of the same year it began to be installed on series IX submarines. However, due to the predominant movement of boats under water in a combat campaign, this powerful anti-aircraft gun was rarely used. Only U 534 was able to shoot down a Liberator from 547th Squadron RAF on May 5, 1945, using this anti-aircraft gun. Below, under the gun pad, two containers for inflatable rescue boats are visible.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>The shortest serving Spitfire On the morning of the 18th August 1940, Flight Lieutenant John Dunlop-Urie at RAF Westhampnett in West Sussex rushed to his aircraft in order to intercept an incoming German raid. Finding his assigned plane undergoing maintenance, he ran instead to Supermarine Spitfire Mk. I serial number X4110 that had been freshly delivered to 602 Squadron. During the course of the combat, Dunlop-Urie was caught from behind by a Messerschmitt Bf 109 that landed several hits with its 20mm cannon.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Italian battleship Giulio Cesare Early in World War II, the ship took part in the Battle of Calabria (also known as the Battle of Punto Stilo), together with Conte di Cavour, on 9 July 1940, as part of the 1st Battle Squadron, commanded by Admiral Inigo Campioni, during which she engaged major elements of the British Mediterranean Fleet. The British were escorting a convoy from Malta to Alexandria, while the Italians had finished escorting another from Naples to Benghazi, Libya. Admiral Andrew Cunningham, commander of the Mediterranean Fleet, attempted to interpose his ships between the Italians and their base at Taranto. Crew on the fleets spotted each other in the middle of the afternoon and the battleships opened fire at 15:53 at a range of nearly 27,000 meters (29,000 yd). The two leading British battleships, HMS Warspite and Malaya, replied a minute later. Three minutes after she opened fire, shells from Giulio Cesare began to straddle Warspite which made a small turn and increased speed, to throw off the Italian ship's aim, at 16:00. Some rounds fired by Giulio Cesare overshot Warspite and near-missed the destroyers HMS Decoy and Hereward, puncturing their superstructures with splinters. At that same time, a shell from Warspite struck Giulio Cesare at a distance of about 24,000 meters (26,000 yd). The shell pierced the rear funnel and detonated inside it, blowing out a hole nearly 6.1 meters (20 ft) across. Fragments started several fires and their smoke was drawn into the boiler rooms, forcing four boilers off-line as their operators could not breathe. This reduced the ship's speed to 18 knots (33 km/h; 21 mph). Uncertain how severe the damage was, Campioni ordered his battleships to turn away in the face of superior British numbers and they successfully disengaged. Repairs to Giulio Cesare were completed by the end of August and both ships unsuccessfully attempted to intercept British convoys to Malta in August and September. On the night of 11 November 1940, Giulio Cesare and the other Italian battleships were at anchor in Taranto harbor when they were attacked by 21 Fairey Swordfish torpedo bombers from the British aircraft carrier HMS Illustrious, along with several other warships. One torpedo sank Conte di Cavour in shallow water, but Giulio Cesare was not hit during the attack. She participated in the Battle of Cape Spartivento on 27 November 1940, but never got close enough to any British ships to fire at them. The ship was damaged in January 1941 by splinters from a near miss during an air raid on Naples by Vickers Wellington bombers of the Royal Air Force; repairs at Genoa were completed in early February. On 8 February, she sailed from to the Straits of Bonifacio to intercept what the Italians thought was a Malta convoy, but was actually a raid on Genoa. She failed to make contact with any British forces. She participated in the First Battle of Sirte on 17 December 1941, providing distant cover for a convoy bound for Libya, and briefly engaging the escort force of a British convoy. She also provided distant cover for another convoy to North Africa in early January 1942. Giulio Cesare was reduced to a training ship afterwards at Taranto and later Pola. After the Italian surrender on 9 September 1943, she steamed to Taranto, putting down a mutiny and enduring an ineffective attack by five German aircraft en route. She then sailed for Malta where she arrived on 12 September to be interned. The ship remained there until 17 June 1944 when she returned to Taranto where she remained for the next four years</TEXT>

    <TEXT>F/O Stanley Michel "Mike" Kolendorski - naturalized American, son of Polish immigrants. He had been living in California with his wife Charlotte May prior to enlisting in the RAF in Canada. His wife then filed for divorce because of this. 17 May 1941. After being scrambled early in the morning in Hurricane Mk IIb Z3186 XR* (71 (Eagle) Squadron) to intercept Ju88's and He111's coming across the channel. At 20,000 ft they came across escorting Bf 109's of the II./JG 53 "Pik As" over the Thames Estuary. Mike Kolendorski turned his aircraft sharply to intercept a pair of Bf 109; s, when a second pair opened fire on him. A warning was given over the R/T, but too late for Kolendorski. It would seem that he was killed in his cockpit as no attempt by him to bale out was observed. Other 'Eagle squadron pilots saw his aircraft crash land in the water and reported Stanley Michel Kolendorski KIA after they had returned to their airbase. F/O Kolendorski's body was washed ashore in the Netherlands on 13th August 1941 near 'Paal 16' at the beach of Rockanje / West-Voorne, Voorne Putten island, Zuidhollandse Eilanden region. His remains were burried at the General Cemetery "Maria Rust" in Rockanje, municipality of West-Voorne.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Airborne Flamethrower!! In this months edition of Fly Past (http://www.flypast.com) it recounts the story of the shooting down of a Do17 of 8Staffel/III/KG76 which along with another 18 Do17'S launched a raid against London on September 15th 1940. The particular palane 'F1+FS' was being flown by Feldwebel Rolf Heitsch, with 3 crew mates (Schmid,Pfeiffer  amp; Sauter). This plane was fitted with a rear facing Infantry Flamethrower in the fuselage. In the forthcoming melle that developed several Allied pilots noted flames coming from the rear of the plane, many believing that they had given the plane it's final kiss of death so to speak. One pilot from 504Sqn had his Hurricane covered in oil, when the Flamethrower malfuntioned at 16,000ft. When it did work it's flame was only some 100yds long, far to short to be effective against fighters attacking from 400yds (365mtrs)." "</TEXT>

We flew this aircraft for over 40 hours before the engine failed in flight and had to be landed dead stick in to a mine field that was unknown to the fliers until they safely walked to a near by road.

    <TEXT>A Mitsubishi A6M Zero of the 253rd Kokutai, tail number 9-112, lands at Tobera airfield, Rabaul, at 10:33AM on January 17th, 1944, after intercepting a group of US B-24 Liberators and P-40 warhawks, filmed on 16mm film by a cameraman named Nichiei. The enemy was detected at 10:00, and 43 Zeros from the 204th Kokutai and 36 Zeros of the 253rd Kokutai rushed to intercept, all in the air within 10 minutes. The battle lasted about 30 minutes, with the attacking American forces managing to sink the repair ship Hakkai Maru, transport vessel Kenshin Maru, and the Japanese Army cargo ship Kosei Maru. They also damaged the aircraft transport Lyon Maru.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Original photo of the Mass held December 24, 1944 in the De Schark Cave, Maastricht, Netherlands. Photo courtesy of the Foundation of the Commemoration of the American Christmas Celebration 1944. In 1944 and inside the sandstone galleries of the De Schark cave, Brothers of the Dutch Monastery Beyart had built an altar where they held services safe from aerial bombardment. Approximately 300 Soldiers were invited to celebrate Christmas Mass. The 1944 Christmas Eve Mass was led by a Father Dobrzynski from New York and whose full name escapes research efforts at the time this story was released. Historical records confirm that most of the Soldiers who participated in the 1944 Mass were from the 117th, 119th and 120th Regiment, 30th Infantry Division Old Hickory, as well as some stranded crew members from allied aircraft that had been shot down. The Soldiers were part of the XIX US Army Corps, Tomahawk, who fought with the 113th Cavalry Group Red Horse and the 2nd Armored "Hell on Wheels" Division totaling approximately 30,000 soldiers who were responsible for liberating South Limburg. At the end of the 1944 Mass, the Soldiers wrote their names on the flattened area Cpl. Barraveccia made and is now their self-made memorial.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Various Regia Aeronautica Ju.87 Picchiatello. Various dates and locations. Pt l The Italian Regia Aeronautica was equipped for a while with the Stukas. In 1939, the Italian government asked the RLM to supply 100 Ju 87s. Italian pilots were sent to Graz in Austria to be trained for dive-bombing aircraft. In the spring of 1940, between 72 and 108 Ju 87 B-1s, some of them ex-Luftwaffe aircraft, were delivered to 96 #176; Gruppo Bombardamento a Tuffo. The Italian Stuka, renamed Picchiatello, was in turn assigned to Gruppi 97 #176;, 101 #176; and 102 #176;. The Picchiatelli were used against Malta, Allied convoys in Mediterranean and in North Africa (where they took part in conquering Tobruk). They were used by the Regia Aeronautica up to 1942. Some of the Picchiatelli saw action in the opening phase of the Italian invasion of Greece in October 1940. Their numbers were low and ineffective in comparison to German operations. The Italian forces were quickly pushed back. By early 1941, the Greeks had pushed into Italian occupied Albania. Once again, Hitler decided to send military aid to his ally.[130] Before the Luftwaffe could intervene, the Italian Ju 87s achieved some successes. 97 Gruppo (Group) and its 239 Squadriglia (Squadron) sinking the Hellenic Navy freighter Susanah off Corfu on 4 April 1941 while the torpedo boat Proussa was sunk later in the day. On 21 April the Greek freighter Ioanna was sunk and they accounted for the British tanker Hekla off Tobruk on 25 May and then the Royal Australian Navy destroyer Waterhen on 20 June. The British gunboat Cricket and supply submarine Cachalot became victims. The former was crippled and later sunk by Italian warships.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>This is an extraordinarily rare photo of one of only four B17C's (Fortress 1's) in the Middle East of only 20 bought by Britain. A bit of a paradox in the desert, but note the icing on the windows and the perspex window framework on the nose. This was a serious problem with these aircraft. The aircraft ended up being a dismal failure in Britain and like all prototype failures, junk and obsolete equipment, four of these aircraft were shipped to the Middle East to be used. At least initially, these operated from Shallufa in the Suez Canal zone of Egypt but maybe other places as well. One (AN518) is known to have been at Mersa Matruh on November 8th 1941 as it had to force land there for fuel. Although a bit of a prophetic picture of new and old technology, the long obsolete forlorn looking Blenheim in the background had nothing to fear. This has nothing to do with the 113 directly but is provided as a matter of interest, and yet one more example of proof that the Middle East theater was used as a dumping ground for unsuitable equipment. The following is the research on the photo : The Fortress 1's were supplied to 90 Squadron April 1941 who reformed into 2 Group for the express purpose of operating the American bombers in a high altitude day bombing role. The scheme, against all advice and strong criticism by the Americans was a disaster. The daylight bombing and solo sorties were issues in themselves, but these aircraft were unproven, had known serious bugs and were not equipped properly for offensive operations. The aircraft were intended as trainers so that skilled crews on this type would be ready when the new 'properly equipped' Fortresses became available. Having lost several before they even became operational, the first misson came July 9th and by September 25, 1941, (scarcely two months later) after a continuous string of disasters they were permanently removed from offensive operations and 90 Sqdn reverted to training with the some of the 11 that were left. Warner Brothers also used a few to make a movie. For lack of something better to do with those that were left, and despite the fact they were a death trap for offensive operations, four aircraft (AN518, AN521, AN529, AN???) were shipped off to the Middle East to Shallufa in the Suez Canal Zone of Egypt. Surprise, surprise, they also proved unsuitable here but at least no lives were lost by this folly. The detachment of 90 squadron was folded into 220 squadron about February 1942 and the remaining Fortresses were limited to general reconnaissance. One of the many problems with this aircraft which plagued the boys back in Britain was sticking bomb release mechanisms. Not so for the enterprising Middle East boys who had to improvise everything, they simply stationed a man by the bomb doors and kicked the bombs out of the aircraft. Another serious problem with these aircraft was icing of critical components at altitude. (Not a fault but a result of the the fact it could reach extreme altitudes)</TEXT>

Surprise, surprise, they also proved unsuitable here but at least no lives were lost by this folly. The detachment of 90 squadron was folded into 220 squadron about February 1942 and the remaining Fortresses were limited to general reconnaissance. One of the many problems with this aircraft which plagued the boys back in Britain was sticking bomb release mechanisms. Not so for the enterprising Middle East boys who had to improvise everything, they simply stationed a man by the bomb doors and kicked the bombs out of the aircraft. Another serious problem with these aircraft was icing of critical components at altitude. (Not a fault but a result of the the fact it could reach extreme altitudes)</TEXT>

    <TEXT>A rare air combat shot: a Ki-43 Hayabusa attacking a B-25 bomber. The encounter happened at Hansa Bay (1944). Neither one was shot down. The Hayabusa was the first modern japanese fighter plane with mobile landing gear and auto obturing tanks. This light fighter showed excellent manoeuvrability and very good flying abilities thanks to a sound design that paved the way for the A6M2 Zero. The downside of this fighter was the total absence of armor and a light weaponry composed of two 7.7 machineguns. This armament was pretty inneffective against heavy US bombers such as B-17s and B-24s. Many pilots spoke about the frustration of wasting all their ammo on a single target without any results. Pilots had to aim to engines and tanks with great accuracy when a single 12.7 allied shot could tear apart their entire plane.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>On 27 August 1941 Coastal Command claimed a rare and unusual success when one of its aircraft was instrumental in the capture of a U-boat. A No 269 Squadron Hudson operating from Kaldadarnes in Iceland, flown by Squadron leader J. H. Thompson, surprised U-570 on the surface. Thomson dropped a stick of depth charges, after which the German crew was seen spilling out onto the casing, waving white flags. This photograph was taken later by a Catalina from No 209 Squadron, called to the scene along with various Royal Navy vessels. Heavy seas at first prevented a boarding party from reaching the U-boat, but eventually they were able to accept the crew's surrender.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>These Burmese signed up to fight with the British as the Japanese invasion was about to begin. The photograph was dated January 3, 1942. They brought their own rifles and swords. We are unsure about their ethnicity, they may be Kachins or Karens. The British defense of Burma was complicated by concerns over the political reliability of the Burmese and the Japanese success in convincing some politically active Burmese that they would support Burmese independence rather than ruthlessly exploit the country as a part of it expanding empire.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Rangoon, Burma, c. 1945-08. Three Japanese soldiers stand beside Westland Lysander IIIA V9303 of No. 357 Special Duties (SD) Squadron RAF at Mingaladon airfield. Two RAF crewmen, including a flight lieutenant (right), are aboard the aircraft preparing it for flight, while another RAF crewman stands to the rear of the Japanese soldiers. The aircraft is about to fly the Japanese to remote areas of Burma where they will be parachuted in to Japanese forces who have not yet surrendered in order to tell them that the war has ended. The Japanese will make their parachute jump from the ladder attached to the side of the aircraft. Because of the long distance the aircraft has to travel, an auxiliary fuel tank has been fitted to the underside of its fuselage.</TEXT>

George Beurling joined the RAF in September 1940 and was posted to No. 41 Squadron RAF a year later. On 9 June 1942, he flew into Malta from HMS EAGLE and joined No. 249 Squadron RAF, with whom he became the top-scoring Allied fighter pilot on the island, achieving 26 victories between 12 June and 14 October 1942. He was sent home to Canada for publicity purposes in November 1942, but returned to the United Kingdom to join No. 61 Operational Training Unit as a flying instructor in July 1943. He transferred to the RCAF on 1 September 1943 and achieved the last of his 32 confirmed victories with Nos. 403 and 412 Squadrons before returning to Canada in April 1944 and retiring from the Air Force the following October. His eccentric, 'lone wolf' nature and an inability to succumb to authority, made him unpopular in the services and contributed to his restlessness after the war. He died in a flying accident, (sabotage was also suspected), on 20 May 1948, while ferrying an aircraft to Israel after having volunteered for service with the nascent Israeli Air Force.</TEXT>

To participate in joint military operations in the Soviet Arctic and retrain the Soviet pilots to Hurricane fighters, new for them, with their subsequent transfer, in July 1941 the RAF was formed as part of the Royal Air Force. The wing consisted of two squadrons (134th and 81st).

Lieutenant Philip Adair of the 80th Fighter Group #8217;s 89th Fighter Squadron is caught by a photographer from  #8220;Life #8221; magazine while stepping down from his Curtiss P-40N Warhawk fighter,  #8220;Lulu Belle. #8221; The large, white  #8220;Skull #8221; that was the dramatic unit marking of the 80th Fighter Group, the  #8220;Burma Banshees #8221; is seen dominating Lulu Belle #8217;s nose. At the time the photograph was taken, Adair #8217;s 89th Fighter Squadron was flying from Nagaghuli in Eastern India #8217;s Assam Valley with the primary mission of defending the Western End of the  #8220;Hump #8221; Airlift. On December 13, 1943, Adair was the first pilot from the 80th Fighter Group to make contact with a large force of 24 Mitsubishi Ki-21 bombers and 35 Nakajima Ki-43 fighters, that was attacking the CNAC  #8220;Hump #8221; Airlift airfield at Dinjan. Alone, but determined to disrupt the Japanese raid, Lt. Adair, immediately attacked the Japanese force, and in the combat that followed, was officially credited with destroying one Ki-43  #8220;Oscar #8221; and damaging one Ki-21  #8220;Sally #8221; bomber and two more Ki-43  #8220;Oscar #8221; fighters.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>The Dawn of Freedom (1944) "This film was made by the Japanese occupation authorities in the Philippines as a propaganda film to show the Philippine people the "benefits" of the Japanese invasion and takeover of their country. Director Gerardo de Leon was notified by the Japanese authorities that he had been selected to direct this film. When he protested that he was a doctor - he had passed his medical exams just a few years prior to the invasion - and preferred to practice medicine instead, he was told, "There are many doctors in the Philippines, but only one director".Real American and Filipino POWs were used as "extras" in this film, which was a clear violation of the Geneva Convention.A scene was filmed showing the withdrawal of American forces from Manila during the Japanese invasion. Large crowds of Filipino civilians showed up for the filming, and the Japanese authorities were pleased at the turnout. They were not pleased to later discover that the reason for the large crowds was that the Filipinos wanted to see and talk to the American and Filipino POWs who were being forced to portray "enemy" troops.

    <TEXT>One of the lesser known uses of the Bren Carrier. It's use in the Philippines They were from the cargo of the SS Don Jose and were hat was "requisitioned" by the USAFFE. http://www.army.mil/cmh-pg/books/wwii/5-2/5-2_15.htm The 26th Cavalry (PS), which had joined the I Philippine Corps after a difficult overland march from Layac junction, was also tired and disorganized. Since there were no replacements for its animals and only a limited supply of forage, it was shortly reorganized into a motorized squadron of riflemen and a mechanized unit equipped with scout cars and Bren carriers According to Eric Morris in his book Corregidor: the End of the Line (New York: Stein and Day, 1981) some elements of the 26th Cavalry (Philippine Scouts) US Army used Bren Gun Carriers as transports from Manila to Bataan. http://www.vac-acc.gc.ca/remembers/sub.cfm?source=collections/hrp/hrp_detail amp;media_id=1482 Lack of Equipment in Hong Kong Interviewer: It's my understanding, Mr. Ewing, that the transport vessels that were to bring your motorized equipment and some of the heavier weapons, including heavy mortars and, and the like, did not arrive. They didn't. Apparently they, they were supposed to go on the Awatea but were not at the dock when, by the time the, the ship sailed. I guess they came in within a day or two of our leaving, but they never did catch up. They were off-loaded in the Philippines, was my understanding, and were used by the American troops in the defence of the Philippines. Because of administrative bungling in Ottawa, the battlion's 212 trucks, jeeps, and Bren gun carriers still sat on a railway siding in Ontario when the troops sailed from Vancouver. A week later, the equipment was loaded onto an American freighter but never reached the Canadians. It ended up in the Philippines where it was captured by the Japanese.

There are two  #8220;413 #8221; markings in this photograph, meaning at least two of these Marines are from Company B  #8211; the man facing away from the camera in full gear (on his shovel) and the man with the black undershirt and rosary (on his helmet.) Presumably, the wounded man and his other helper are from Baker Company as well; the helping man on the right appears to have his name stenciled on his helmet, but the photo doesn #8217;t quite pick it out. They are also presumably moving back through the command post of either Company B or the First Battalion itself on their way to the aid station  #8211; note the officer on the telephone at center, and the rebar and concrete of a wrecked Japanese emplacement providing cover  #8211; but without the full caption it #8217;s hard to say for sure. As Iwo Jima ground on and more and more replacements came to the front line, UNIS markings became more scarce  #8211; the original Marines who #8217;d inked them onto their gear just weren #8217;t around anymore. The wounded man has the look of a replacement with his carefully bloused trousers, smooth face, and general cleanliness. Again, though, without a photographer #8217;s caption that recorded the unit, date, and location, any attempts at identification will be best-guess at their most optimistic."</TEXT>

    <TEXT> #8220;Big Dick #8221; in the craps is a pair of fives. Ten as a pair of 5 #8217;s may also be known as  #8220;puppy paws #8221; or  #8220;a pair of sunflowers #8221; or  #8220;Big John. #8221; taking into account that  #8220;Dick #8221; is a diminutive for Richard, one can guess that for this play on words the captain, and later Major Richard A. Hewitt has chosen the name for a plane which is the subject of this gallery: P-51D-20NA serial number 44-64147 code MX-U, 82nd Fighter Squadron 78th Fighter Group, in Duxford. On 21 March 1945 Hewitt became commander of the 82nd Fighter Squadron. Two days before that, flying on that plane shot down a pair of Bf-109 near Osnabruck. He had also a lot of luck, because rejecting underwing tanks (started the fight with tanks) he forgot to switch on the internal tanks and engine immediately lost power  #8211; but somehow he managed to start the engine again and two Bf-109 went to the ground  #8211; the pilot of the first one rescued his life with a parachute jump, the second pilot was killed in the wreckage of his machine. [Http://www.ulongbeach.com/78th_Combat_Reports_1945.html] On 17 April 1945 also piloting this Mustang, Hewitt destroyed one Me-262 on the ground for sure and probably another one, which he caught landing during the attack on the airport (Lechfeld?)  #8211; Unfortunately, this victory could not be formally confirmed as the only witness was his wingman, who during the same attack was shot down and captured [Aces of the 78th Fighter Group, Thomas McKelvey Cleaver, Osprey Publishing 2013]. Officially confirmed were a total of 4 Hewitt #8217;s air victories and 4.3 enemy planes destroyed on the ground. The number of swastikas on the canopy frame visible in the photos suggests that the photographs have been taken in the second half of March and April 1945, and one can assume that it shows all victories attributed to the pilot, including those not officially confirmed. Hewitt survived the war with a score of more than 100 combat missions in two rounds (he joined the 78 Group stationed at Duxford in August 1943 ending the first round just before D-Day, to return to the front in July 1944, serving until the end of the war).</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Spitfires of the US Navy By Steven D. Hill | Posted on 2010-04-11 | Comments (14) | Category: Articles | Tags: 1944, history, Spitfire Mk. V During the Second World War, the skies over France and Germany were the responsibility of Britain #8217;s Royal Air Force and the United States Army Air Forces. US Naval aviation had only limited opportunities to engage Hitler #8217;s armed forces. Although no fast carrier task force was present to support the landings at Normandy on 6 June 1944, Naval Aviators did, in fact, participate in this greatest amphibious invasion in history. VCS-7, Seagulls to Spitfires Naval Aviation #8217;s mission on 6 June was to provide air spotting support for the cruisers and battleships bombarding targets along the Normandy beachhead. For this purpose, each vessel normally carried several aviators and two or three floatplanes, either SOC Seagulls or OS2U Kingfishers. Both aircraft performed the spotting mission quite well. Operations in the Mediterranean during 1943 had shown, however, that against strong enemy aerial opposition the SOCs and OS2Us were far too vulnerable. They lacked the speed and manoeuvrability to escape attacks made by Focke-Wulf Fw 190s and Messerschmitt Bf 109s. In the Mediterranean, efforts were being made to train VCS pilots in the handling of fighters such as the P-40 Warhawk and P-51 Mustang. Flying fighters, the air spotting pilots stood a much better chance of eluding enemy air attacks. Perhaps because of the high demand on P-51s for strategic bomber escort duties, it was decided that 17 VCS and Battleship Observation (VO) pilots aboard the cruisers Quincy (CA 71) Tuscaloosa (CA 37) and Augusta (CA 31) and the battleships Nevada (BB 36) Arkansas (BB 33) and Texas (BB 35) would be checked out in RAF Spitfire Mk Vbs. The 67th Tactical Reconnaissance Group, Ninth Air Force, under the command of Colonel George W. Peck, was assigned the task of checking out the VCS-7 aviators in Spitfires. Training was conducted at the 67th #8217;s base in Middle Wallop, Hampshire. The training syllabus consisted of defensive fighter tactics, aerobatics, navigation, formation flying and spotting procedures. On 8 May, Lieutenant Robert W. Calland, senior aviator aboard Nevada, assumed command of the squadron. He was relieved by Lieutenant Commander William Denton, Jr., senior aviator aboard Quincy, on the 28th. That same day, the squadron became fully operational and moved to Royal Naval Air Station (RNAS) Lee-on-Solent. Ten squadrons, five RAF, four Royal Navy FAA (Fleet Air Arm) and VCS-7, were brought together at Lee-on-Solent to provide air spotting for the fire support ships of the Western and Eastern Naval Task Forces. The Western Naval Task Force, Rear Admiral Alan G. Kirk commanding, would land the US. First Army on beaches Utah and Omaha. The Eastern Naval Task Force would land the British Second Army on beaches Gold, Juno and Sword. Two of the RAF squadrons, Nos. 26 and 63, flew Spitfires. The other three, Nos. 2, 268 and 414, flew Mustang Mk. Is and Mk. lAs. The four FAA squadrons, Nos. 808, 897, 885 and 886, were assigned Seafire Mk. Ills. On D-day, all aircraft were pooled. This meant that VCS-7 flew whatever type was available, either Seafire or Spitfire. Although Mustangs were present, they were not flown by any VCS-7 aviators-the reason being that they had not been checked out in the type. At noon on D-Day, the RAF Mustangs were withdrawn for tactical reconnaissance duties. This left some 95 aircraft available for air spotting support at RNAS Lee-on-Solent. Typical spotting missions utilized two aircraft. The lead plane functioned as the spotter. The wingman, or  #8220;weaver #8221;, provided escort and protected the flight against enemy aerial attack. The clocking, or ship control, method was utilized on the majority of spotting sorties. Standard altitude for spotting missions was 6,000 feet, but poor weather forced the spotter to operate between 1,500 and 2,000 feet. Occasionally, missions were flown at even lower altitudes. Drop tanks were used to increase range. A typical spotting sortie lasted close to two hours. This provided 45 minutes on station and 1 hour in transit. The Luftwaffe was rarely encountered, although six of the station #8217;s aircraft were shot down by German fighters. Four VCS-7 pilots were attacked by Bf 109s and Fw 190s, putting the fine defensive capabilities of the Spitfire to the test. All four aviators successfully avoided being shot down. Flak, however, was common and accounted for the squadron #8217;s only loss, Lieutenant Richard M. Barclay, senior aviator aboard Tuscaloosa. Lt. Barclay #8217;s wingman, Lieutenant (jg) Charles S. Zinn, also from Tuscaloosa, managed to return home despite severe damage to his right wing and aileron. The exact number of aircraft lost by VCS-7 during the Normandy campaign cannot be verified as of this writing. VCS-7 #8217;s action report mentions only the loss of Lt. Barclay #8217;s aircraft. Author David Brown in his book, The Seafire, the Spitfire that went to sea, claims that VCS-7 lost 7 aircraft to enemy action and 1 operationally in 209 sorties flown. Unfortunately, Mr. Brown fails to cite the source of his information. According to VCS7 #8217;s action report, the squadron flew a total of 191 sorties between 6 and 25 June. The busiest days were the 6th, 7th and 8th. During those three days, a total of 94 sorties were flown. Following the bombardment of Cherbourg on 26 June, naval gunfire support operations ceased. The fighting had moved inland out of the range of the ships big guns. VCS-7 was, therefore, disbanded by order of Adm. Kirk, and all personnel returned to their ships. During 20 days of combat operations, the aviators of VCS-7 were awarded 9 Distinguished Flying Crosses, 6 Air Medals and 5 Gold Stars in lieu of additional Air Medals. Ten VCS-7 aviators went on to participate in the invasion of southern France and three others took part in the invasions of Iwo Jima and Okinawa in the Pacific during 1945.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>The ARL V 39, also known as the ARL 1940 V939 40, was a prototype tank, designed to meet France's demands for a new self-propelled assault gun, prior to World War II. It was designed to support eight infantry battalions, each with two batteries of three vehicles. Only two complete and functional prototypes were produced, armed with a modified 75mm field gun and 7.5mm machine gun. The design project was known as ARL 40, unrelated to the ARL 44 heavy tank. Designed in 1935, two prototypes were completed by 1940. However due to the later occupation of France, mass production to meet orders was canceled and the prototypes evacuated to Morocco, ceasing any further development in the project.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>The Breda Ba.65 was an Italian all-metal single-engine, low-wing monoplane used by Aviazione Legionaria during the Spanish Civil War and Regia Aeronautica in the first part of World War II. It was the only Italian ground-attack aircraft that saw active service in this role. It saw service almost exclusively on the North African front. In addition to more than 150 aircraft operated by the Italian forces, a total of 55 were exported and used by the air forces of Iraq, Chile and Portugal. Design and development An evolution of Ba.64, the Ba.65 was designed by Antonio Parano and Giuseppe Panzeri. It was a single-seat, all-metal, low-wing cantilever monoplane with aft-retracting main undercarriage. Like its predecessor, it was intended to undertake aeroplano di combattimento multiple roles as a fighter, attack and reconnaissance aircraft.[3] The Ba.65 carried wing-mounted armament of two 12.7 mm (0.5 in) and two 7.7 mm (0.303 in) Breda-SAFAT machine guns, with internal stowage for a 200 kg (440 lb) bombload in addition to external ordnance that could total 1,000 kg (2,200 lb). The prototype, which was first flown in September 1935, like the initial production aircraft, used the 522 kW (700 hp) Gn #244;me-Rh #244;ne K-14 radial engine produced under license by Isotta Fraschini. Starting from the 82nd aircraft, the more powerful Fiat A.80 RC.41 18-cylinder, twin-row radial engine with a takeoff rating of 746 kW (1,000 hp) was adopted. Production ceased in July 1939 after 218 aircraft were built by Breda and Caproni. Operational history The Ba.65 debuted during the Spanish Civil War. Thirteen Series I aircraft, powered by the Gn #244;me-Rh #244;ne engine, equipped the 65a Squadriglia of the Aviazione Legionaria (Legionary Air Force). The unit took part in operations at Santander in August 1937, then at the battles of Teruel and the Ebro.[3] The aircraft proved effective and was compared positively with the German Junkers Ju 87 Stuka. In a unique engagement, one of the Legionary Air Force pilots scored an air-to-air victory when he encountered a lone twin-engine Tupolev SB-2 bomber over Soria and shot it down. Of the 23 Ba.65s sent to Spain, 12 were lost in the course of the civil war. They flew 1,921 sorties, including 368 ground-strafing and 59 dive bombing attacks. When the Aviazione Legionaria returned to Italy in May 1939, they bequeathed their 11 surviving Ba.65s to the Spanish Air Force. A total of 25 Fiat-powered Ba.65s two-seaters were sold to the Kingdom of Iraq in 1938. These consisted of 22 equipped with Breda L turrets and two dual control trainers. From 2 #8211;31 May 1941, the Royal Iraqi Air Force flew the Ba.65 during the Anglo-Iraqi War. War broke out after an Iraqi coup d' #233;tat installed a new government while maintaining the existing monarchy. The Ba.65 was used against armed forces of the United Kingdom and the Commonwealth of Nations which the coup leaders were trying to expel from bases established after Iraq's independence under the Anglo-Iraqi Treaty of 1930. During World War II, the Ba.65 was employed against the British in North Africa. When Italy entered the war in June 1940 about 150 aircraft were reported to be still in service, but suffered heavy losses facing the British fighters. Most were either out of service or shot down by February 1941. The aircraft, which had been forcibly kept in service after the failure of the Ba.88 and the poor performance of the Caproni Ca.310, was replaced in the dive bomber role by modified Savoia-Marchetti S.79s or fighters. Chile bought 20 Ba.65 (17 single-seaters and three dual control trainers) powered by the Piaggio P.XI C.40 (also a 14K derivative) late in 1938. Portugal purchased 10 Breda equipped with Fiat engines and Breda L Turrets in November 1939.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>"A long range version of the Ju 87B was also built, known as the Ju 87R, the letter being an abbreviation for Reichweite, "(operational) range". They were primarily intended for anti-shipping missions. The Ju 87R had a B-series airframe with an additional oil tank and fuel lines to the outer wing stations to permit the use of two 300 litres (79 #160;US #160;gal) standardised capacity under-wing drop tanks, used by a wide variety of Luftwaffe aircraft through most of the war. This increased fuel capacity to 1,080 litres (290 #160;US #160;gal) (500 #160;litres in main fuel tank of which 480 #160;litres were usable + 600 #160;litres from drop tanks). To prevent overload conditions, bomb carrying ability was often restricted to a single 250 #160;kg (550 #160;lb) bomb if the aircraft was fully loaded with fuel. The Ju 87 R-1 had a B-1 airframe with the exception of a modification in the fuselage which enabled an additional oil tank. This was installed to feed the engine due to the increase in range with the extra fuel tanks. The Ju 87 R-2 had the same airframe as the B-2, and strengthened to ensure it could withstand dives of 600 #160;km/h (370 #160;mph). The Jumo 211D in-line engine was installed, replacing the R-1s Jumo 211A. Due to an increase in overall weight by 700 #160;kg (1,500 #160;lb), the Ju 87 R-2 was 30 #160;km/h (19 #160;mph) slower than the Ju 87 B-1 and had a lower service ceiling. The Ju 87 R-2 had an increased range advantage of 360 #160;km (220 #160;mi).The R-3 and R-4 were the last R variants developed. Only a few were built. The R-3 was an experimental tug for gliders and had an expanded radio system so the crew could communicate with the glider crew by way of the tow rope. The R-4 differed from the R-2 in the Jumo 211J powerplant."</TEXT>

    <TEXT>"Whale The dock piers were code named "Whale". These piers were the floating roadways that connected the "Spud" pier heads to the land. Designed by Allan Beckett the roadways were made from innovative torsionally flexible bridging units that had a span of 80 ft., mounted on pontoon units of either steel or concrete called "Beetles". Spud Piers The pier heads or landing wharves at which ships were unloaded. Each of these consisted of a pontoon with four legs that rested on the seabed to anchor the pontoon, yet allowed it to float up and down freely with the tide. Beetle They were moored in position using wires attached to "Kite" anchors which were also designed by Allan Beckett.These anchors had such high holding power that very few could be recovered at the end of the War. The Navy was dismissive of Beckett's claims for his anchor's holding ability so Kite anchors were not used for mooring the Bombardons."</TEXT>

Nevertheless, on 31 October 1940, the Falchi scored their first confirmed air victories in North Africa against the Hawker fighters. During the air battle over Mersa Matruh Sergente Maggiore Davide Colauzzi and Sergente Mario Turchi from 368a Squadriglia, while escorting SM.79 bombers, shot down the Hurricanes of 33 Squadron that were flown by 26-year-old Canadian Flying Officer Edmond Kidder Leveille (RAF no. 40837) - who was forced to bail out but was killed when his parachute failed to deploy completely and Flying Officer Perry St Quintin (Hurricane P3724), who was forced to make a forced landing at Qasaba with a holed fuel tank"</TEXT>

    <TEXT>"The Stinger LMG During the war in the Pacific, the United States Navy and Marines lost thousands of aircraft not only to enemy action, but also to accidents and mechanical failures. It was from some of these junked aircraft that enterprising marines obtained  #8216;surplus #8217; ANM2s and decided to modify them for use on the ground. Marine with Stinger machine gun.Early marines such as Private Bill Colby in 1943 used a re-purposed ANM2, still with the spade grips attached, simply by jury-rigging a bipod to the front of the barrel. In November 1944, Para Marine Sergeant Mel J Grevich, of the machine gun section G Company, 28th Marine Regiment, 5th Marine Division, began a more complex adaptation. With the blessing of his commanding officers all the way to the battalion level, he began manufacturing the new weapon in Hawaii while the 5th MARDIV waited to invade Iwo Jima. Taking surplus ANM2 and parts acquired  #8220;from God knows where, #8221; Grevich manufactured six finished weapons with the help of Private First Class John Lyttle. Lyttle for the record said years later of the base machinegun parts that,  #8220;I don #8217;t recall how or where we got them. #8221; The design took the ANM2, removed the spade grips, added a simple trigger to the firing solenoid, used M1 Carbine replacement stocks for a grip, attached a BAR bipod to the front, gave the whole thing a 100-round box magazine that held a linked belt of ammunition, and painted them a camouflaged color. The result was a weapon just over forty inches long, weighing in at a manageable 25-pounds, and capable of firing 30-06 rounds at a rate three times faster than the standard M1919A6 of the day. They were not pretty, but they could drop it like it was hot so to speak. Each of the Stingers as they were called was dubbed with females names. Mel #8217;s own personal example was named  #8220;Betty Ann. #8221; The Stinger on Iwo Jima Mel Grevich and the rest of his division sailed from Hawaii in January 1945 towards the Japanese home islands. Each of the six Stingers in the hands of 28th Marine Regiment gunners served excellently. The only complaints were that the weapon #8217;s extremely high rate of fire and thin barrel overheated rapidly. This was because the base weapon had been designed to be with the 300-mph slipstream of a US Navy with Stinger Machine gun.dive-bombing aircraft to cool it. However, the gunners soldiered forward and concentrated on short meaningful bursts to take out pillboxes and on-rushing enemy soldiers with great effect. One of the six gunners with Stingers on Iwo was Corporal Tony Stein. Stein landed on Iwo Jima February 19, 1945 with his unit and in the initial assault, he was among the first members of his unit to set up a defensive position away from the beach. There he began to engage Japanese forces with his custom Stinger machinegun. Corporal Tony Stein held his Stinger light machinegun on target and destroyed enemy pillbox after pillbox by charging them alone and destroying the crew inside while firing away with his weapon. The Stinger #8217;s extremely high rate of fire and the momentum of the combat led quickly to Stein running out of ammunition. Kicking his shoes off and throwing his M1 helmet down, he ran back to the beach to get more 30-caliber ball for his weapon. As he ran, he picked up a wounded fellow Marine and carried him back to the beach to obtain aid. He repeated this feat no less than 8 times, bringing a wounded man back to the beach, grabbing a few belts of ammunition to fire at Japanese pillboxes, and then returning with a smoking weapon and another wounded Marine. Later that day he performed a rear guard action covering his unit #8217;s withdrawal. Corporal Stein #8217;s Medal of Honor Citation signed by President Harry Truman reads in closing,  #8221; Stouthearted and indomitable, Corporal Stein, by his aggressive initiative, sound judgment and unwavering devotion to duty in the face of terrific odds, contributed materially to the fulfillment of his mission, and his outstanding valor throughout the bitter hours of conflict sustained and enhanced the highest traditions of the United States Naval Service #8221;. Corporal Stein never saw his award, being killed on the frontline by Japanese gunfire on March 1, 1945. It was recommended that one Stinger replace a BAR in each squad, but this was never put into effect as the war ended just six months later.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>In 1944 the US was suffering from a shortage of shells. They formed units to use captured German guns, "In the ETO the 79th Field Artillery Battalion (Provisional) was formed from personnel of the 79th and 179th Field Artillery Groups to fire captured German artillery pieces during the height of the ammunition shortage. Similarly, the 244th Field Artillery Battalion was temporarily equipped with a miscellany of captured German 88mm guns and 105mm and 150mm howitzers." "In WWII, one battalion of U.S. field artillery was armed for a time on with captured weapons. Here is some information on this unit. 244th FIELD ARTILLERY BATTALION (August 1944 on) WEAPONS POOL 88L56 AA Guns (German) 105L28 Howitzers (German) 150L30 Howitzers (German) 155L16 Howitzers (French) The 244th arrived in France as a towed 155mm Gun Battalion, but was quickly converted over to a new status as a "Captured Weapons" battalion. To ease the shortfall in American artillery ammunition, the 244th was equipped with captured German Artillery. It was not used as Field Artillery per se, but was used to give additional artillery support for areas of the line in need of support which had captured German supplies on hand. Elements of it served around Metz for example during the siege of that town. "8 DECEMBER THROUGH 14 DECEMBER. At 1600 on 8 December Corps became operational as planned when the 345th Infantry, 87th Division, completed relief of the 5th Division in containing Fort Jeanne d'Arc, the only fort which had not by this time capitulated. At that time Corps assumed full responsibility in the Metz area, and in addition to the already attached units received the 244th. Field Artillery Battalion (minus Battery B) which was equipped with cap #173;tured enemy weapons; Battery B of the 558th Field Artillery Battalion; and the 16th and 30th Chasseur Battalions. These two French battalions were used for guard duty and the occupation of the already captured Metz forts. These new units, in addition to the previously attached 32d Antiaircraft Artillery Group, 8th Tank Destroyer Group, 11th Tank Destroyer Group, and 87th Infantry Division, completed the III Corps order of battle as of that time." "An excellent example of such initiative took place during the recent war in Europe. General Patton's Third Army, faced in the fall and early winter of 1944 with a stringent ammunition shortage, refurbished and put into action serviceable items of captured artillery. On 2 November 1944, one corps #8212;the XX #8212;was employing 39 such pieces, classed as follows: four 76.2-mm Soviet guns, ten 88-mm German guns, eight 100-mm fortress guns, six 105-mm German howitzers, two 122-mm Soviet guns, six 150-mm German howitzers, and three 155-mm French howitzers. Up to that date, this corps had fired 30,920 rounds of ammunition weighing 660 tons and valued at $702,391. USD For the week ending on 29 October of that year, 80 percent of the artillery ammunition fired by the XX Corps had been captured from the Germans. One time-on-target mission fired on a German troop concentration at Amanvillers was executed by U.S. tank destroyers, 90-mm antiaircraft guns, 155-mm M1 howitzers, and by German 105-mm gun howitzers, German 88's, Soviet and French Schneider 155-mm howitzers. The Soviet weapons, and those of the French, had been seized from Allied forces earlier in the war, and had been recaptured by the Third Army. "</TEXT>

    <TEXT>The Fieseler Fi 167 was a 1930s German biplane torpedo and reconnaissance bomber designed for use from the Graf Zeppelin class aircraft carriers under construction from 1936 to 1942. Since the Graf Zeppelin was not expected to be completed before the end of 1940, construction of the Fi 167 had a low priority. When construction of the Graf Zeppelin was stopped in 1940, the completion of further aircraft was stopped and the completed examples were taken into Luftwaffe service in the Erprobungsgruppe 167 evaluation/test unit. When construction of the Graf Zeppelin was resumed in 1942 the Ju 87C took over the role as a reconnaissance bomber, and torpedo bombers were no longer seen to be needed. Nine of the existing Fi 167 were sent to a coastal naval squadron in the Netherlands and then returned to Germany in the summer of 1943. After that they were sold to Croatia, The remaining planes were used in the Deutsche Versuchsanstalt f #252;r Luftfahrt (German Aircraft Experimental Institute) in Budweis, Czechoslovakia, for testing different landing gear configurations. The large wing area and low landing speeds made it difficult for the Fi 167 to properly carry out the tests so the two test aircraft had their lower wings removed just outboard of the landing gear. Croatia The Fi 167's short-field landing and load-carrying abilities made it ideal for transporting ammunition and other supplies to besieged Croatian Army garrisons, between their arrival in September 1944 and the end of the War. During one such mission, near Sisak on 10 October 1944, an Fi 167 of the Air Force of the Independent State of Croatia was attacked by five North American Mustang Mk IIIs of No. 213 Squadron RAF. The crew of the Fieseler had the distinction of shooting down one of the Mustangs before itself being shot down #8212;possibly one of the last biplane "kills" of the war.</TEXT>
