    <TITLE>I Thought She Was My Forever</TITLE>

    <TEXT>Girlfriend of two years broke up with me out of nowhere. Said that she just doesn't love me anymore. Am taking a break from talking to her because I kept getting mad at myself and lashing out at her. I just miss her. Even if she doesn't want me like that, I wish I was strong enough to be in her life. But I don't really think she wants me at all. She told me she still wanted to be friends, but then she ignored me and got mad when I explained that she broke my heart. I just. I wish I could go back to before she dumped me and do something different. I wish I could have been better for her.</TEXT>

    <TITLE>Found a wild mouse in our basement. Was clearly injured/ill and I didn't want to leave it outside in the rain to die. Fed it, gave it water, and kept it warm. Died peacefully in my room this afternoon. RIP, mouse.</TITLE>

    <TEXT>It really means a lot to hear that. I'm sorry you've gone through something similar, and while I understand the urge to turn to alcohol, I hope you have healthy outlets for your pain. You deserve to forgive yourself. I hope you find lasting happiness soon. xx</TEXT>

    <TEXT>This was my post. :) Thank you so much for the advice! She's honestly such a strong, brave person and I'm really inspired by how hard she's fighting to get better. As someone who relapses with my ED frequently, I understand how hard it can be to stay motivated in your recovery, so I wish you all the best with your own journey.  lt;3</TEXT>
