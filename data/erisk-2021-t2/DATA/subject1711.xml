    <TEXT>I try to find new music so im not listening to the same stuff, but i always find myself trying to look for music like Deuce and end up listening to him anyways. I love his voice its so distinct and unique and he's an amazing singer. Im a HU fan and one of my favorite songs is This Love, This Hate just cuz i love his voice. Im hopeless.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Ive been doing real good, I started college, i made some friends ive been cleaning up around the house. Shit normal people do takes every ounce of my will, but i have been doing good. Yeah, until today. Its funny how a small event, a misunderstanding, can lead to this. I wont go into it, but i cut again for the first time in months. It was erratic and deep but felt so fucking good, justified by my loneliness and how no one would even care if i bled out on my bed. I really wanted to die. But why? In the best time of my life I want to kill myself. I tried so hard to change for the better but im still a blood soaked wreck. Fuckin pathetic.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Ehh i been on a week or so binge, i dont do a lot just a daily microdoser here lol. But its starting to do less effect like i gotta do a big ol line to get me right. If i stopped for a month or 2 would it hit hard again? I just got a new plug and when i first tried it i was on top of the world lol, now it just brings me to a norm. Also curious on yalls prices since covid? Payed 300 for 2gs which is ridiculous but i wanted some blow lol</TEXT>
