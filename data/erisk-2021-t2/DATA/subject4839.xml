    <TEXT>[giveaway] EDIT: Went go bed, so I wil close now. I wil sure do another in 2-3 days with IV breeded bulbasaurs! And these will still be available :) __________ First give-away, yay :) Not the best give-away, but it's just a start. All of the pokemon are lv1, so you can level lock. The cyndaquils are breedjects from a shiny hunt. Deino and Kangaskhan were breedjects from good IV search. Modest Deino: * Total: 22 (18 left) * 3 IV: 4 (1 left) * 2 IV: 5 The rest is 1 IV or not tested Random Kangaskhan: * Total: 30 (28 left) * 3 IV: 6 (one of these is adamant [traded] ) (4 left) * 2 IV: 8 Random Cyndaquil: * Total: 5 boxes (if you suggest nature, I will search it, can't promise to have it tho) Deposit a pokemon with the message: First give-away! Add your IGN, pokemon, lv and request in a comment.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>[casual] So I recently started breeding a lot (comp/shiny hunting), and after those breedings I would like to do give aways. For the shinyhunting I always need a foreign pok #233;mon. And instead of searching one everytime I would like a foreign ditto. The IV's are mainly to make the give-aways a tiny bit better :) swapping from time to time during breeding might come to better results. Thanks in advance! P.S. My region is english and I caught the ditto myself</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Hi guys, I am looking for a new mobile workstation. Because of certain Software I use (Solidworks and Visualise), I need a GPU like Nvidia Quadro. I already filtered to get it down to 3 devices, which one do you guys recommend? Other suggestions are welcome as well ;) - MSI WS60 6QJ-057 (Nvidia Quadro M2000M) - Fujitsu laptop: CELSIUS H770 (Nvidia Quadro M2200) - Lenovo Thinkpad P51 (Nvidia Quadro M2200) https://www3.lenovo.com/be/nl/laptops/thinkpad/p-series/ThinkPad-P51/p/20HHCTO1WWNLBE1/customize? I'm leaning towards the Lenovo because it's has a better price and customisable. If needed I can give more specifications per laptop (especially Lenovo because I chose some other options than default). My initial minimal requirements, not really a budget range: - Intel I7 - 16GB RAM - SSD 256GB - NVidia Quadro (2GB+) - 15" screen My current laptop is a Dell Precision but it can't detect my GPU anymore, among with other problems (randomly shutting down, wifi chip fails from time to time, heating problems).

But I haven't done it in ages so I kind of forgot everything about the hardware etc. My sister is building an escape room in our house and she asked for my help with a puzzle. It's actually really simple, there is a row of 20 LED's in 4 different colors. There is a riddle connected to them, but it doesn't make sense at first sight. The players have to push a hidden button along the way to turn off a couple of LED's so that the riddle can be solved. Now my question is how I should set up that configuration and what hardware components I would need. The software part is really simple so that won't be a problem :p</TEXT>

    <DATE>2018-06-08 23:17:11</DATE>
    <TEXT>Hi guys, Today I stumbled upon this project: https://hadron.cloud/ This is a short description of what they do: Hadron lets people mine AI in their web browsers on phones and computers to enable incredibly powerful AI computations on a global scale. It won't be like other minable currencies, it's useful computations allow people with weaker machines, including most smartphones, to still earn and spend. Hadron creates a distributed artificial intelligence supercomputer with unprecedented speed and blockchain cost efficiency while letting new users start mining in just seconds. In terms of competitors Hadron is similar to Golem, however the team believes that greater accessibility will lead to Hadron surpassing Golem. They already have a working platform. It let's you mine, however it's only in beta phase at the moment and not accessible for everyone. With the coins you mined you can already 'buy' some services for testing purpose :) Hadron is making sure to build strong fundamentals before will start there ICO, so there is no risk in investing in vaporware when they start their ICO :) You can sign up to follow the project on their website.</TEXT>

    <DATE>2019-01-01 13:50:30</DATE>
    <TEXT>Hi guys, Quick question here, do you guys have any idea how one can easily sell Bitcoin in Sri Lanka? We send money for school books to a befriended family every year, and we pay  #8364;20 fee on a  #8364;50 transaction. I want to buy bitcoin here which is super easy, but I have to explain them how they can convert to their native currency (LKR)</TEXT>

    <DATE>2019-01-02 15:15:02</DATE>
    <TEXT>I bought myself a cool Monowheel (Inmotion V10), and I was looking for some protective gear. I found a webshop accepting Bitcoin, and decided to buy there https://www.sickboards.nl/en When I was at the payment screen I saw they used BitPay... Sad because it requires me to do so much extra steps (make mobile wallet, send BTC from Ledger to mobile wallet, wait for conf, no custom fees). Anyway, I proceeded with my payment and all went fine. However, I sent them a mail about Bitpay, and why it was a bad experience. I suggested them to use BTC pay server instead. Got an answer pretty quick thanking me for the suggestion, and that they already wanted to change to another service :) A good day for crypto! Also my first purchase of 2019 was with Bitcoin,who can tell that?</TEXT>

    <DATE>2019-01-04 23:44:52</DATE>
    <TEXT>I never had my own fighting game, so I never really trained these skills. I'm a huge Pok #233;mon fan, and I used to love Donkey Kong as a kid. Later I started playing Mario Kart. None of these game prepared me for this seemingly random button mashing game :p I don't seem to develop a certain strategy/skill. I spend some time in the training room letting myself fall off the platform to train my recovery, and I tried doing combo's by throwing the other in the air etc. But as soon as I enter a regular battle all that training seems to be wiped away, do you guys have any tips on how to improve in real battle, and not only in training? I watched some video's, but can't really reproduce their moves. The character I would like to play with is Pikachu (or another Pok #233;mon). Sorry for the dramatic post ':) Edit: didn't meant to offend you guys, I know it's not a random button mashing game, but you have to admit one is easily lost when someone explains button combinations you have to press almost perfectly</TEXT>

Problem is of course that the qr code will hang there for a while, but the price of btc won't stay the same. I would prefer it to be on lightning network of course.

    <TITLE>Components needed for a node with raspberry pi</TITLE>
    <DATE>2019-01-16 23:12:02</DATE>
    <TEXT>Hi all, I asked about a way to accept payments pegged to USD value conveniently, and came to the conclusion that I would need a screen for that (as in, I won't be able to print out a QR code). Though I would find it silly to just dedicate a screen for a QR code that's only needed a few times a day, so I want to link it to something usefull. A (lightning) node! Can someone enlighten me with which components I will need to buy in order to create a node, and a screen that can generate a QR code? Would be cool to choose some predetermined values (as not everything is priced the same). My knowledge with micro controllers is all from Arduino, and I have quite a lot of components. But I don't own a raspberry pi yet, so I have no idea where to start. Thanks :)</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Is there research going on about the rarity of Smeargle? I just finished 70 sessions (1 picture per session) without a photobomb. Haven't caught a Smeargle yet. Makes me wonder the odds of getting a photobomb... If it is this rare then I think it's a failed mechanic that doesn't really promotes AR pictures.

I am now constantly grinding pidgey/doduo lands in hope to get a good Pidgey with a flying move but it just doesn't seem to work. I'm ok not being able to finish the island this time because my lack of Pok #233;mon, but do you guys have any suggestions about what I should do? Do evolutions have higher base CP? I was grinding pidgey because it was so common, and I have a plus 9 bonus already (I hope it's percentages and not actual cp? Seems pretty useless otherwise...)</TEXT>

    <TEXT>The switch screen pops up so fast you're probably still tapping that charge move that was just ready, right?

Why not just delay the pop up for a second so that you know you fainted and can stop tapping?

    <TEXT>I'm making badges ever since boulder cup. Up until rainbow I used a 3d printer (with Tempest being an exception). This month however, university was closed so I couldn't print anymore without spending tons of money. Luckily a friend on mine has a lasercutter, so I bought myself some acrylic sheets (3mm). What you see is engraved transparent plexiglass and engraved green plexiglass. No paint was used. The design is made in Solidworks (I used it for the 3d prints, and it's the program I'm most comfortable with).</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I can print for  #8364;0.1 per meter PLA. I don't have to pay the lasercutter, so that makes the badges a lot more affordable. I'd say if you can find a good shop you can do it for less than 30ct per badge. Make sure to buy cast acrylic though</TEXT>

    <TEXT>This is a lasercut piece, in some cases it's cheaper than a 3d print. The result is often better, only limitation is that you are forced into 2d shapes. If you want cheap ideas, try a button with a printed logo on. It's cool because you can pin them on a backpack or so, and when you buy them in bulk it's very cheap!

This is a team building spreadsheet that allows you to: * Get a quick overview of the strengths and weaknesses of your team. * Make adjustments accordingly and look for potential duo #8217;s and trio #8217;s to use! * Test your team against other potential teams to see how you stack up in training! Play around with it for a bit, and you #8217;ll get a better understanding of the meta and how your team fits in! We made a 'default' 6 in the team builder in case you want something to start from. https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1kTQZmalavCftg4AEULlwgFl6dGDcmSvycAd13We8oNQ/edit?usp=sharing #160; Good luck in your tournaments!

    <DATE>2019-11-18 00:54:54</DATE>
    <TEXT>TL DR: run 2 tournaments with different themes at the same time, where you have to complete both matches before continuing to the next round. So I tried a thing during the mirror month, where we started a twilight and a kingdom tournament at the same time. Players then could choose to play either one or both of the tournaments. Players who did both got priority when 2 people hadbthe same opponent, since rounds lasted a little longer there was more time to chat, trade and catch in between. To the point now, this kind of event will be possible again in the first week of January! Since the cups will now have a one week overlap. If you like this idea, and your community is not to big I strongly recommend this format. It's kind of a stress test to keep 2 meta's apart.</TEXT>

    <TITLE>My quest to the perfect Dragonair for Timeless (Spoiler, it's not rank 1)</TITLE>
    <DATE>2019-12-10 00:13:04</DATE>
    <TEXT>Hi guys, I just had a crazy night of doing tons of sims! Some of you might already know about the stamina bulk point on Dragonair, today I'll take it a little further! (TL DR below) Here's some context if you haven't heard about the 128hp bulk point:A mirror match typically lasts 21 dragon breaths, and then the next one KO's. So if you have a Dragonair with 6 x 21 + 1=127HP you can survive 21 dragon breaths. If you don't have 127hp, you die after 20 dragon breaths. Not all high rank Dragonair have that stamina 'bulk' point. My rank 386 doesn't have it, while my rank 414 does... Guess which one I'm using. This allows me to throw a charge move and still tie if my opponent doesn't have 126HP. If the opponent throws as well I win ever time. There's quite a lot of people favoring def over stam. But my 6 10 15 Dragonair beats a 1 15 10 for example: [https://pvpoke.com/battle/1500/dragonair-33-6-10-15-4-4-1/dragonair-35-1-15-10-4-4-1/11/0-0-0/0-0-0/](https://pvpoke.com/battle/1500/dragonair-33-6-10-15-4-4-1/dragonair-35-1-15-10-4-4-1/11/0-0-0/0-0-0/) Keep in mind that a shield still takes 1hp. So to be safe you want 6 x 21 + 1 to survive + 1 to shield = 128 With this in mind, knowing that I have that sweet 128hp, I can throw a charge move feeling even more safe. I now beat a 1 15 12: [https://pvpoke.com/battle/1500/dragonair-33-6-10-15-4-4-1/dragonair-35-1-15-10-4-4-1/11/0-0-0/0-0-0/](https://pvpoke.com/battle/1500/dragonair-33-6-10-15-4-4-1/dragonair-35-1-15-10-4-4-1/11/0-0-0/0-0-0/) If the other decides not to throw, it's still a tie and 50% chance I'll still win (you can't tie on 1 turn fast attacks anymore). What does this means? You'r rank 11, 15, 19, ... anything below 127HP Dragonair is pretty trash in the mirror. Now we just have to secure the Kingdra match up. Usually Kingdra is the one surviving the lead. But there's a break point for Dragonair to deal 6 damage instead of 5, and a bulk point to take only 6 instead of 7 damage.If we take into account the 128hp rule for the mirror, we might have created the perfect Dragonair a 10 3 15: Rank 1 Kingdra: [https://pvpoke.com/battle/1500/dragonair-33-10-3-15-4-4-1/kingdra-21.5-0-15-13-4-4-1/11/0-1-4/0-3-2/](https://pvpoke.com/battle/1500/dragonair-33-10-3-15-4-4-1/kingdra-21.5-0-15-13-4-4-1/11/0-1-4/0-3-2/) You still beat rank 1 Meganium with no baits, or straight AT: [https://pvpoke.com/battle/1500/dragonair-32-10-3-15-4-4-0/meganium-24-0-10-15-4-4-1/22/0-1-4/1-2-1/](https://pvpoke.com/battle/1500/dragonair-32-10-3-15-4-4-0/meganium-24-0-10-15-4-4-1/22/0-1-4/1-2-1/) Now surely there must be some downside to run such a low rank Dragonair? Sim along and find some matches Dragonair used to win but loses with a low sp score :D Keep in mind you might loose to a more attack weighted Dnair with the stats **TL DR:** my rank 2792 Dragonair might be better than my highest ranked. Edit: adjusted the IV's of the 'perfect Dragonite, there's a few combinations that work.</TEXT>

If the opponent has that 128+hp you will result in a tie if he throws a charge move and you don't (keep in mind you're down a shield in that case).

    <TEXT>Hey, that's almost my team. I have bronzong as my 6th slot. Though that's pre Empoleon CD (I have swampert instead of Empoleon). I really enjoyed Altaria as it's extremely dominant in the 2 shield scenario, it even beats bronzong in there. Double mudboy double steel gave me a lot of options depending on where my opponent laid it's focus. Altaria and venusaur are perfect bodyguards when you double up on something. With that team you have a counter for everything. Though I don't like opposing poliwrath  #128521; I'm probably making a new team for after CD, and swampert might be replaced with Empoleon as a start</TEXT>

    <TEXT>If you lead a water ground pok #233;mon into a victreebel. You have to get out of that match up so you'll have to swap. But if you swap to your hard counter to grass, your opponent will likely counter swap and you'll lose your hard counter. However if you swap to a softer counter, you can try to overcome that bad lead by keeping the hard counter in the back for later. But a competitive PvP battle is full of these little things like move counting, overcharging to save energy, keeping track of your opponents energy etc. I think PvP is really awesome, and to me it's the best part of pogo at the moment. But I also understand it's not for everybody. I always hope casual players just join for the social part</TEXT>

He can then swap to his rock type or whatever. He might defeat my ice type, but I still have a fire type in the back for that grass type. It's not a 1 after the other battle. Swapping and shielding can help you overcome a bad lead. That's why people talk about 'safe swaps' or generalists. But yeah, I understand it's not everyone's thing</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Depending where they put it. I just had an opposing Awak and I won, but it was close. People often lead it, and the bastiodon Awak match up is really decent for bastiodon! In my last battle the Awak swapped out to azu, I did a few extra smack downs before I swapped to meganium. I know I can tank an ice beam, and I throw my second (he shielded the first) just before he got to a second ice beam (5 bubbles). Azu dies and meg has a shield and energy left. If Awak comes back I know they don't have a flyer, and I try to reach for an earthquake. If it gets shielded I let meganium down and tank the 2 incoming bone clubs on bastiodon and then I hit it with a 1HKO stone edge. If he does swap to a flyer, Bastiodon is still very comfortable to tank whatever the flyer throws at it after farming meganium. But overall I'd say toxicroak or Awak are pretty hard games, but not auto losses. I made this team to counter azu/regi/Altaria and it works really well no matter the lead</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I have a few examples on video where undertapping is still a thing. It's situational, but very handy if you know when to use it. When you do your last fast move, and it gets interrupted by a charge move you will have enough energy for a charge move after the animation. But when you tap the charge move immediately you do a fast move instead. What you have to do is wait a turn (0,5s) and then tap. This way you don't do that extra fast move, and fire of your charge move. Can be very handy when you die in the x turns you lose doing that extra fast move (ofc only applies to 2+ turn fast moves) But if it's gone for you then for the better  #128521;</TEXT>

    <TEXT>It's not a bug. You didn't really CMP in the first place. What happened is this: Opponent clicked his charge move while you are finishing your fast move. You also click your charge move. What happens is opponent throws charge move first because you are still doing your animation, then right when the opponents charge move finishes you throw yours (since the button was already pressed on your side it qued it right after the opponents charge move and not during). This is not a CMP where both players throw at the same time. Me and some others started calling these 'fake CMP's' hooked moves You can see the difference between the 2 where at the CMP tie the camera doesn't zoom out, but at a hooked move the camera zooms out on your pokemon, and you even see your charge move buttons sometimes (but that is not consistent and depends how long your fast move should have lasted).</TEXT>

    <TEXT>If he shielded the last charge move coming from altaria he would still lose and be down a shield. There's really nothing to gain from there. If he shielded twice, it would be a 0-0 shield game and if odds are against you swampert throws a sludge wave on that shiftry However, the shiftry had a loaded charge move. So OP could safely use Deoxys to finish off the altaria and be up 2 shields. Then simply swap in shiftry on the swampert and throw the move... Being up 2 shields, having a charge move ready that oneshots your opponent and 2 full health pok #233;mon is better than having switch advantage sometimes. OP didn't know pok #233;mon nr3 yet, so it could have been something that takes out both shiftry and Deoxys in the 0 shield.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I didn't pick default altaria indeed. Because you can see pretty early on the opposing Altaria does double damage with it's fast move. From that point you know that your azumarill loses if it only shields once. So you either double shield and risk that the altaria swaps out on your last Ice Beam. Or you accept that you'll lose switch advantage but you're up 2 shields</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Go to 0:40. Do you really think Azumarill will reach the Ice Beam if he shields there? He is 2 bubbles away from even being able to throw an Ice beam. That is 16 damage and the health bar was already really low. It's not random IV's, I just picked whatever PvPoke suggested as an altaria that get;s the breakpoint against azumarill which was clearly the case here. This just proves you can't analyse the health bar on Azumarill propperly because I'm 100% sure the Altaria does get the breakpoint here</TEXT>

This is only possible when Altaria reaches the breakpoint against Azumarill and thus deals 2 damage instead of 1 damage. I mean, look at the health bar when altaria throws the 3th move. Do you really think azumarill would be able to do 2 more bubbles and fire of Ice Beam? Please tell me you see that's never gonna happen</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Switch advantage is not critical if you are 2 shields up and a charge move that beats 1 of the opponents pok #233;mon in 1 turn. Not sure what you mean with the first part of your comment. Azu always wins the equal scenario indeed, I never said it didn't. DD beats altaria just fine with a shield you saved. What is opponent going to do? He can't swap in pok #233;mon nr3 which we didn't saw yet, as he'll have swampert in the back and we have shiftry. So opponent has to go to swampert, we swap in shiftry while swampert does a mud shot. We beat the swampert, now it's shiftry + DD + 1 shield against registeel. Way more comfortable than having switch advantage imo. As registeel beats DD in the 0 shields</TEXT>

Sableye can't hurt shiftry so it can even save a shield for swampert if it magically charges a sludge wave before shiftry can throw. Deoxys defense beats wiggly with 1/3th health with 1 shield. Beats clefable with 19 hp left. That's pretty close already given that DD has to finish altaria first. But even if the Deoxys goes down. Shiftry just uses leaf blade to finish the clefable.

    <TEXT>Just a side note, I had my final summon at 4 seconds, so I used another high cp with a lv4 zygarde summon because it was super effective. If the boss goes into summon minions mode, keep using glaciate, you won't hit minions. Then when the shield pops up, swap to a feint user, roll behind the boss and hit. Then go back to glaciate</TEXT>

And even if you would do a fast move, this should result in a hooked charge move, which would fire off after his charge move where the camera zooms in and out.

If you don't throw the second move with Blaziken, the opposing swampert takes an extra counter instead. So Blaziken wins that lead scenario and can throw either stone edge or blaze kick on whatever comes in. Since your water is now down, I bet I'll get that second shield on whatever comes in.

    <TEXT>No, just a tap. I'll try to give an example. On hypno you can do a punch after 4 confusions, so you keep tapping until you see the 4th confusion. Then you stop tapping, and you only tap the charge move button when the confusion is at it's final turn (confusion is 2 seconds, you tap at 1.5 seconds or later). This will prevent overtapping without losing turns. You can also wait until the confusion is completely over before tapping, but if you don't tap in the 0.5 second time window you risk losing a turn (which ia honestly not as bad as overtapping a 4 turn move). Good luck! This works with every fast move, also the 2 amd 3 turn moves</TEXT>

    <TEXT>It is viable for sure. But not sure if worth an elite TM or powering up your only Cresselia. So maybe one from a trade could do. Every rank has different meta's I think, but I also see Charizard from time to time (2780 currently). Zard double charmer is a pretty good line I've seen multiple times. Venusaur next to never probably. Future sight is also the best option Cresselia has against Escavalier. Handy if your up a shield and can throw FS twice.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Initiating a fast move has nothing to do with priority. It will always happen. That's why it's sometimes better to do one fast move yourself, as you know he'll get a full fast move for free (useful to do a fast move yourself is if it's against a confusion user or something). Only 1 turn fast moves deal damage before the initiated charge move. So if a pok #233;mon is close to 1hp, you can swap in a 1 turn fast mover and faint it before it will be able to throw</TEXT>

Don't let that scare you though. You first tournaments should be just for the fun of it, so run whatever you want (but also don't expect much). Once you get to know the format, you can start investing in other pokemon while learning the game mechanics better. It's a little easier to start in live tournaments, because there's always a good atmosphere. That's probably not for soon though :/</TEXT>

    <TEXT>If you are used to running a very bulky altaria you might notice the difference. Because you give up a lot of bulk (12/0/4) is what I run now. The good thing is that there are rarely any deciding break points because it has a lot of bulk by itself. The most important thing is that a shadow ball from a haunter is much more threatening than against a bulky altaria. But I see way more Azumarill. And if I can force a shield in the lead, and safe swap to altaria I can beat their Azumarill which is really cool</TEXT>

I've read about some set ups with a Pi, but also just an unused laptop. What do you guys recommend that is the most stable?

    <TITLE>Suggestion for Silph Season 3</TITLE>
    <DATE>2020-08-17 08:19:37</DATE>
    <TEXT>An 11 month season is really long for many players (granted, covid had a lot of influence in the burnouts as well). But on the other hand having season end in August is ideal. So what if there is a break in September as off season, but also a mid season break? A month where there's no new meta, no weighted and just open tournaments for those who really like to battle. Could be the month before regionals. Or another retro month. As long as there's no weighted it's fine. Just an idea that came up in my community that I wanted to share!</TEXT>

Even though they get gold in most of the tournaments they participate. 11 months is just a very long time. And people are already taking a break now, which makes August kind of anticlimactic. Last year it was am amazing month to celebrate the end of a season. This year it's a struggle to find players, many of the high ranked players didn't even do one yet</TEXT>

Then I finally got to TM it, but I actually went for leaf tornado/acid spray. I like that leaf tornado has that potential debuff, and with the shadow bonus the damage isn't even that bad. I might change acid spray to sludge bomb though, as I rarely used it when I got 2 moves. Stopped running it for this season though. Too many players know about the team and the hate towards it is really really sad.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>You can not choose which tournament you will weight if you do more than 6 tournaments. So if you want to get high in rankings it's better to weight a 6 or 7 rounder. But now you can do 6 attempts to do good in such a big tournament. (you can't weight a tournament anymore after you've done 6 tournaments that month) This results in players skipping small tournaments to play in those big ones. As playing in a small one basically means you're throwing one attempt away. In the previous season I did a lot of small tournaments in the first part of the month. Then I'd choose a big tournament at the end of the month. This season I cannot do that anymore, which gives me 2 options: 1) don't do the small tournaments anymore (they where already struggling for numbers) 2) accept that I'll not end up high in rankings</TEXT>

    <TEXT>There are definitely people winning matches ONLY because of IV's. I get your message but I strongly disagree. Yes it doesn't matter often, but sometimes picking certain IV's allows you to use a strategy that involves flipping a certain match up. For example, I specifically took a set of IV's on altaria that allowed me to beat any opposing Azumarill in the 2-1 shield scenario, and against play rough it wins the even. Nobody expects that, and it allows me to use my Altaria to be an Azumarill counter I'm up 2 vs 1 shield. (a swap to Altaria almost always lures out an Azumarill, which is exactly what I want). This is just 1 example of how IV's are super important when making a strategy</TEXT>

The next 2 links show the 2-1 Azumarill match up with IB/HP. It shows yours loses and mine wins. You said yours hit the breakpoint while it clearly doesn't. Far from it. I am ok with giving up a lot of match ups while actually beating Azumarill (and whiscash can't double blizzard in the 1 shield either, which is really nice). Azumarill is super common in GBL, I don't care it suddenly loses some irrelevant match up. As a bonus: You said yours wins with an energy advantage. here is a link where you have a 51 energy lead (17 dragon breath, 8.5 seconds): [https://pvpoke.com/battle/1500/altaria-28.5-2-15-15-4-4-1/azumarill-40-8-15-15-4-4-1/21/0-3-2/0-2-1/139-189/51-0/](https://pvpoke.com/battle/1500/altaria-28.5-2-15-15-4-4-1/azumarill-40-8-15-15-4-4-1/21/0-3-2/0-2-1/139-189/51-0/) Mine wins on equal energy, so I don't have to hope my opponent waits 9 seconds with his swap.</TEXT>

I made a matrix battle to see which match ups I exactly give up with going all in on attack. I'd be really sad by the fact that I now lose to Octillery, Croconow, Gigalith, Boldore, Metang, Dugtrio, Geodude, Honchkrow, but the truth is, I think I literally never saw any of those in GBL so far. So no, I don't really care about the lower win total. Since 90% of those pokemon don't matter. And Azumarill is the one I'd like to beat.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Of course I focus on the few gains from going in with more attack. If you didn't notice, that's what this thread is about. I'd rather win 1 relevant match up while giving up 20 irrelevant ones. Than lose the match up I'm most likely to see when I swap to Altaria. I promise you there is nobody who's gonna swap in an Octillery as an Altaria answer. I think what you fail to see is that I made a plan in advance (lure in an Azumarill when I'm in a 2-1 shield scenario), and I chose the IV's on a pok #233;mon to make that happen. I honestly don't see why you think that is a bad thing. Nothing wrong with brainlesly going for the highest rank, but you have to realize there's benefits in going for specific IV's as well If you don't get it by now, I don't think I'll be able to explain you.

    <TEXT>If I didn't have that IV's on my altaria I would never blindly swap to Altaria. Because I know I'll get wrecked by Azumarill. So it matters 100% in this case. That 2-1 scenario is what it's all about. The health left on Altaria is amazing. I've caught so many people off guard with it. Even during Continentals, which is considered the tournament with the most competitive players of the continent. The Altaria is only 1 example. But I can give an example for every meta Silph has ever announced. Like Venusaur vs Froslass, Sableye Probo, Gfisk Awak,... The one thing I might agree with is that IV's don't matter too much in GBL (but even there, there's a certain pool of pokemon you just know are more common). For the record, I tell newer players to not care about IV's either ;) But this is the Silph Arena, where you can expect people to up their game</TEXT>

    <TEXT>You said my altaria wins less match ups than yours. So I went to pvpoke, plugged in both IV's and looked for the differences. Mine loses to Octillery, so it's one of those losses you where talking about. My counter argument is that I don't care Octillery is now a loss instead of a win. Nor do I care any of the other never-used-Pok #233;mon are now losses. I think it's not a good thing to plug in IV's and just look at total numbers, you have to look at what relevant pokemon are different I agree that Bulky Altaria is very good, but I need the atk IV's to use my Altaria the way I like it.</TEXT>

A shadow ball from Haunter is also more threatening. But honestly it's just the bulk you give up, so you might notice it's going down faster. But altaria gets taken out by a charge move most of the time anyway, so I don't really care Whishcash can't do 2 blizzards in the 2 shield because dragon breath does more. But that's more easily accessible. Also a nice plus to attack weighted Altaria.
