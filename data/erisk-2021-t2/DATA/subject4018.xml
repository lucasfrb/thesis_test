I don't exactly remember what I put, but I really pushed the cancels, negates, and all these... in addition to white spells like Legion's Judgement (Destroy Target Creature with Power 4 or more...) and so on... I probably only had like 10 creatures in that deck. It wasn't a winning deck but the looks of disappointment on my friend's faces when I destroyed 6+ Mana creatures with a 3-mana cards were hilarious.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>You know this feeling when you come back home from your job/ school/ whatever and finally get to lay on your bed, and it feels like loathing in your emptiness is the omly comfort you ever get to have. Happiness often feels uneasy to me, and I don't really feel sad, but this emptiness, man, it's so good. I feel at ease when I come back home and realize I'll just lay in bed in my dark room and stay in this state of depression. I want to recover, but at the same time, I don't wanna give this feeling up. I don't wanna give depression up, as it has become a big part of me that is my comfort zone.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>oh yeah that's the problem with Rachmaninoff, he's kind of an advanced composer and doesn't have a lot of accessible pieces. As for Chopin, when you feel able to (in case you haven't yet) watch documentaries about Rubinstein and Alfred Cortot. They're Chopin pioneers and will give you a lot of insight about how to play Chopin. and try to learn some Rachmaninoff, at least passages, that way you can prepare yourself for him in a way.</TEXT>

I post them on a twitter account and then tweet on my main about it, only to find out that no one fucking cares. No one. The views I have are from my therapist and my cousin. This is exactly the type of shit that makes me wonder if anyone cares at all. Friends say they care about you and then when the time comes, nothing. I don't get what was wrong that made them ignore the tweet. This is the type of shit that makes me go to bed amd lay there all day.</TEXT>

I don't have the courage or ability to tell my friends because of some things that happened before, aside from me refusing to recieve attention or letting them know. I don't want them to know that I'm back like I was before. Being overly-open has caused a lot of problems and honestly, I don't want them to happen again. I'll just cry out with the music I make until anyone reaches out to me, because I can't reach out to anyone. Maybe I'm not here to be helped, but to help others until I either die or kill myself.
