    <TEXT>For me father is very important and in one point in my life I started to spending more time with him than with my mum. Father is someone who shows you how the world works and what is important in life. He is someone who navigates you to your life path. He is in few ways more important than mother. Mother is raising you and father is preparing you for the adult life. Now when I am 20 years old man, I love spending time with my father. Tbh we don't talk to much but we are just doing thing together or simply watch TV siting next to each other. And I think that for me as a son it's something what I need and love.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Hi. So, me and my gf are thinking about starting to having sex, and when we were talking about it she told me that she wants to do this with me but she wants to go to the gynecologist first. I understand that and I don't have anything against this. But it was 6 months ago... she still hasn't seen a doctor yet. When I ask her if she is scared, or if she really wants to do that she always answers that there is no problem, she will do it but she is in her period or she doesn't know a number. When I'm trying to talk to her about it she is starting to apologize me for all of this waiting. I have to admit that I am getting frustrated because of that, and I am feeling really bad about it. I'm feeling like I am a bad bf who only wants to have sex but it's not true... I don't know what should I do, and have no idea what is a reason of this situation. Is it me who pushing to much or something else??</TEXT>

    <TEXT>But we found a doctor like month ago but she still didn't call. Maybe I should be with her when she will be calling... And we started fooling around before we started talking about sex and than she told me that she really want to do that. And tbh I feel terrible when I'm trying to talk about it because I feel like I am pushing too much and after few months I started to have daubts about that she wants to do this....</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Enthusiasm is really important to me and being more into it. I mean just iniciate some sexy situations, just begin the foreplay. I love when it's not me who is doing all the work but we teasing each other. It's a huge turn off when for example I'm going down on her and she's not showing any enthusiasm whatsoever. Then she leaves me with a thought that she does not like it and I'm forcing her to sex. And also using sex as a reward or some kind of bargaining card its huge red flag for me. Because sex is a intimate and beautiful act between two people who love each other, and it shouldn't be used to blackmail anyone</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Its really understandable that you are angry and hate this guy, actually I don't really know how u feel, but I am definitely sure that you have to sit with your parents and tell them how you feel. Don't be afraid of your emotions and let them loose, it will definitely help you deal with this situation. You can also talk to someone about it (teacher or psychologist in your school) they will help you. You are the most important person for yourself so take care of yourself. You can do this! Good luck fellow teenager in this complicated word  lt;3</TEXT>
