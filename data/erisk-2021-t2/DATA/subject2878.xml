    <TEXT>Sup, I'm wondering if anyone of this community is going to Robert Johnson on october 25th for Rhadoo and Villalobos? [https://www.residentadvisor.net/events/1320747](https://www.residentadvisor.net/events/1320747) I'm solo-raving this time as pretty much all my friends would not survive till 12pm and I definitely wanna experience every single second of Rhadoo's early morning set. if anyone's down for a beer or two, let me know. I actually cannot wait for this. Missed RPR at Robert Johnson in august due to exams preparation.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>In terms of releases you should definitely check out NTFO. They are the first producers that come into my mind when I think about breaky rominimal. They have some pretty dope sets on soundcloud as well. You could also check out Nu Zau if you #8217;re lookin for that particular sound. i wouldn #8217;t put Cap into the same Category, but it #8217;s still worth checking him out. He blew me away at robert Johnson Club in August and I #8217;ve been a huge fan of him since then.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>if you play vinyl, keep an eye on Tellum and Botanic Minds releases, they usually have at least 1 "breaky" cut on each release. Tellum005 and BotanicMinds007 are dropping this month or early november. and man... check out that Zorg - Eclipse001 release, that B2 track is a one way ticket to the moon lmfao.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>regarding the blur in this game, I highly recommend going into the config file and add these lines, especially the first 4. the last 4 come at the cost of a few fps, make the game look better though. game looks phenomenal with this tuning. \[/Script/Engine.RendererSettings\] r.SceneColorFringe.Max=0 r.Tonemapper.Sharpen=0.6 r.DepthOfFieldQuality=0 r.MipMapLodBias=-1 r.ViewDistanceScale=4 r.SkeletalMeshLODBias=-2 r.StaticMeshLODDistanceScale=0.25 type %localappdata% in search bar then Packages -- gt; privatedivision...-- gt; LocalCache -- gt; Local -- gt; Indiana -- gt; Saved -- gt; Config -- gt; WindowsNoEditor and then open engine.ini save it afterwards. can't help ya with the performance issues though. game runs fairly well on my end, couple of fps drops in outside areas but overall pretty stable</TEXT>

    <TEXT>being someone who definitely noticed an increase of microstutters even with improved hardware, I've tried lots of different things to mitigate said issue. I found two videos made by the same guy that are at least worth checking out. It's obviously hard to say if and what tweak might have decreased frametime spikes caused my windows. But it probably doesn't hurt trying. I stopped playing PUBG a long time ago but I definitely felt like it was running worse on my 2080ti, 8700k (windows 1803 and 1903) than on my 1080ti (windows 1709)  #8203; here's the vids [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fOO2J9\_Aizs](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fOO2J9_Aizs) [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QR1kmd9kYVY](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QR1kmd9kYVY)</TEXT>

    <TEXT>highly recommend tweaking the config file for this game as it greatly improves the visuals in this game. does look a bit blurry with all the stupid post processing effects (DOF, bloom, lens flare etc) on. add these lines to the engine.ini file and you got yourself an awesome lookin game \[/Script/Engine.RendererSettings\] r.SceneColorFringe.Max=0 r.Tonemapper.Sharpen=0.6 r.DepthOfFieldQuality=0 r.MipMapLodBias=-1 r.ViewDistanceScale=4 r.SkeletalMeshLODBias=-2 r.StaticMeshLODDistanceScale=0.25  #8203; as for the optimization. its got a lil bit of stuttering in outside areas, nothing too bad though. its smooth as butter inside and I'm pretty sure Obsidian is already working on the issue.  #8203; Edit: you find the config file by typing %localappdata%" in search bar then: Packages -- gt; Private Division...-- gt;LocalCache -- gt; Local -- gt; Indiana -- gt; Saved -- gt; Config -- gt; WindowsNoEditor -- gt; then Engine.ini  #8203; have fun</TEXT>

He's always been trying to evolve his sound and try different things while simultaneously staying true to himself. definitely ro-minimal-ish though. Considering that rominimal covers a wide range of sounds, I still wanna recommend one or rather two romanians because I think their sound is unique in this wide spectrum of rominimal and absolutely amazing, and that is SIT ( Cristi Cons, Vlad Caia) [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aRvjhQj-HMk amp;t=4012s](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aRvjhQj-HMk amp;t=4012s)  #8203; I'm also a big fan of Janeret, quite honestly my favorite DJ these days.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>ye I agree on everything Varhat definitely has a different sound. heck, I'm literally in the same boat as you trying to find DJs that have a similar sound as Janeret xD  gt;Do you like other genres of electronic music? well, a year ago I didnt listen to electronic music at all. had been a hiphophead for more than 20 years. basically since the day I yoinked a tupac LP from my dads collection as a fuckin 7 year old xD. homie introduced me to electronic music. liked it, went to my first raves without him. got addicted. started listening to it at home,digging through what feels like an infinite amount of subgenres while simultaneously abandoning hiphop more and more. and now here I am, bought my first technics 1200 and started collecting vinyl lol. but regarding your original question lol: while I'm very open to other genres, I really really love minimal house. it's just really dope to dance to. Lost count of the times, I got completely lost on the dancefloor basically coming back from moon at 10am. it's hypnotizing almost calming while also being groovy and funky. I can't see myself feeling the same with faster techno. I did like a few sets I saw on boiler room. I think it was a guy called hector or something which I found really dope. but again. wouldnt be as fun to dance to as minimal house. I might go to de school and check out freddy k next month, because I'm in amsterdam and theres no better event on this very day. we will see how much I'm gonna like it lol. you?</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Ye most definitely like coming home. I #8217;ve always been really really passionate about music and being in this electronic scene gives me that feeling of being surrounded by like-minded people. Something I never felt when I was at a hiphop concert, doesn #8217;t matter how underground it was. Probably the reason why I #8217;m still addicted to  #8222;clubbing #8220; even though I #8217;m in my 30s as well. Well i haven #8217;t found a woman I wanna spend my life with either so I can do whatever pleases me lmfao. AnYway, I might go to a venue called BRET on November 16th and check out zendid. If you #8217;re in Amsterdam and wanna have a couple of beers, I can send you a msg a day prior to that. Gonna be there with a couple of buddies but they aren #8217;t really into house/techno, so I might go on a solo mission lol. Either way have a good one. I #8217;ll send you other DJs if I come across stuff you #8217;re lookin for.</TEXT>

A game that #8217;s actually pretty similar to rayman is guacamelee 2. super fun game with a nice humor and fun gameplay. I think just recently trine 4 released and seems to be pretty decent as well. Definitely not as good as my other suggestions. also red dead 2 releases on pc tomorrow.

I definitely think that arthur looks a bit too sharp with these settings but I take it as long as I can get the surroundings as sharp as possible. I'm pretty happy with the results. If I wasn't too lazy I'd show you a few screenshots. I hope you dont mind xD also, there's definitely graphic mods coming in the future that add a bit more clarity. apparently there's already reshade presets out but I'm playing on vulkan and setting up reshade for vulkan is apparently a pain in the butt.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>It isn #8217;t a  #8222; bug #8220; per se though. It #8217;s quad core cpus reaching their limit. Have been for quite a while actually. I #8217;m not defending this as there #8217;s definitely some issue and the game is definitely super power hungry ( maybe too much for what it #8217;s worth) but people need to realize that quad core cpus are kind of a thing of the past.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>It 100% is tied to your pc power. And the fact that it happens with lowered settings is also logical because that puts even more stress on your cpu. In fact I #8217;m pretty sure you probably would get less stutters with higher video settings because you #8216;re much rather getting gpu bottlenecked than cpu bottlenecked. i haven #8217;t had a single fps drop on a 8700k with a mix of ultra and high settings, res scale 1.25x, 1440p. it #8217;s pretty much only people with i5s who been suffering from these issues.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Because you #8217;re bottlenecked by your 10 year old cpu. People have to realize that the days of quad cores are gone. Sure this game has issues but calling this a case of bad optimization when the game runs flawlessly on 6+core cpus is a bit questionable. I haven #8217;t had a single stutter yet, flawless 60 fps with perfect framepacing on a 8700k.</TEXT>

    <TITLE>First Time Rave in Amsterdam - couple of questions</TITLE>
    <DATE>2019-11-12 11:02:29</DATE>
    <TEXT>hey guys,  #8203; 1.) this may as well be the most obsolete question I've ever asked but I'm actually really confused. I'm in Amsterdam this upcoming weekend. Not for the first time but the first time since I'm genuinely addicted to techno/house. What I'm mostly concerned with right now is, whether tickets are being sold at the doors as well or if clubs in Amsterdam handle it quite differently compared to Germany by selling their tickets exclusively via RA. The reason I'm askin this is, that there's no indication on RA. Not really much going on on friday but I've decided I'd check out Luciano in "de marktkantine", depending on whether the friends I'll be travelling with wanna join [https://www.residentadvisor.net/events/1321296](https://www.residentadvisor.net/events/1321296) What I'm really interested in is this event on saturday on Veronica Schip [https://www.residentadvisor.net/events/1330232](https://www.residentadvisor.net/events/1330232) (I know I know it's minimal house, don't hate me xD) but I simply cannot find out whether tickets are sold at the door as well. Reason is, my friends aren't as deep into electronic music as I am. I'd absolutely ditch them if they planned on going to some trash event but that really would be my last resort. So buying tickets at the door is what I'd prefer. do you guys know, if Marktkantine and Veronica Schip are usually selling tickets at the door, too? I've tried to reach out to Picnic London via Instagram and RA but didn't get a reply. 2.) Since clubs open earlier and close earlier than germany's, when are peak times to be expected? Are people going before midnight?  #8203; Thank you</TEXT>

I don't wanna waste money by buying a ticket for myself but end up in a different venue because I don't wanna ditch them xD</TEXT>

    <TEXT>even though it's quite different to the minimal sound you are lookin for, I'd definitely dig through the romanian sound. it's quite influenced by house, some artists more than others but I find it to be way more engaging and interesting than old school minimal. I've been totally addicted since I found the guys from A:rpia:r. Since then I've been to sunwaves, mioritmic and generally to more raves than ever before. the rominian scene covers quite a wide range of different minimal sounds, but it's definitely worth digging through it rhadoo is my favorite guy for some psychedelic early morning vibes, check this one out: [https://youtu.be/dBRUADJ4eNk?t=4108](https://youtu.be/dBRUADJ4eNk?t=4108) this is Petr Inspirescu (same label as rhadoo) [https://youtu.be/aqTAVXX9Wj4?t=817](https://youtu.be/aqTAVXX9Wj4?t=817) also highly recommended: Priku [https://youtu.be/vmZ556z6dXo?t=212](https://youtu.be/vmZ556z6dXo?t=212) there's many many more....</TEXT>

    <TITLE>2C-B as a temporary substitute to MDMA for music enhancement?</TITLE>
    <DATE>2019-11-26 11:39:53</DATE>
    <TEXT>Sup dudes, let me start by saying that I pretty much only roll when I go to a rave. I'm a huge minimal/minimal house fan and been going to various events across europe. and obviously experiencing the likes of a:rpia:r on a roll is a mindblowing experience and made raving without it almost boring for me. that's pretty much why I took way too much mdma over the last 8 months. Anyway knowing that this isn't particularly good for my brain, I'm looking for substitutes, so I can fly to Mars more than once every 3 months. I've read quite a bit about 2C-B. People saying that on low doses it's quite similar to mdma in terms of music enhancement. you guys agreeing on this? anything else that could serve as a temporary substitute until my next mdma rave?

    <DATE>2019-12-02 18:01:16</DATE>
    <TEXT>Hey, let me start by talking a bit about myself, I #8216;m a 31 year old man who has been single for almost 3 years after a rough battle with my ex over the course of many years. Safe to say I was so sick of relationships I haven #8217;t even considered going for any nor have I met anyone who I considered  #8222; good enough #8220; to open myself again. I also went through to final exams of my law studies which were followed of two years preparatory service that ended with what we call  #8222; 2nd state exams #8220; just a month ago. I simply had been too busy to have the mindset for relationships. I #8217;m now waiting for results so I can finally work as a lawyer. I #8217;m a huge fan of electronic music. I was at a small to middle sized underground techno/house event here in Germany where this young DJane (shes 23) was playing, she #8217;s definitely on the raise, played the biggest clubs in my area, Mostly as warm-up to some pretty big names. It #8217;s the second time i saw her even though I didn #8217;t listen to her set the first time I saw her. Anyway, I noticed she was watching me after her set quite often and smiled when I looked her in the eyes. She actually asked me for a lighter later on even though she probably could have asked her friends behind the dj booth. I #8217;m horrible at having smalltalks so I didn #8217;t take advantage of that and did not talk to her besides:  #8222;dope set btw #8220; We danced close to eachother later on. Listen I may have imagined things or interpret the situation the way I want it to be but Its really the first time I liked a girl at first sight really. I kinda wanna msg her on her instagram but don #8217;t know if a) I should do it and b) what to write. One of my best friends said,I shouldn #8217;t write anything related to her hobby/work as that would seem like some cheesy fan letter, what do you guys think? Did I fuck it up already by not using the chances I had or is a Instagram message of any sort a way to tell her that I really am interested in learning more about her. man i feel like a idiot tbh but on the other hand I really shouldn #8217;t give a fuck and just msg her right? I mean what #8217;s the worst thing that could happen?! Thank you</TEXT>

I do agree that her set should be my opener and I probably just should tell her the way I felt. That i did like her set and that I wouldve talked with her a bit more if we weren't surrounded by people and loud music lol. Her insta isn't as big as it may have seemed in my first msg (1k followers). Imma just tell her what I said and see how it goes. thank you</TEXT>

    <TEXT>yeah definitely. I'm a pretty self-reflecting dude, so I definitely notice when things change. I noticed that I became ridiculouly anxious about stuff. I'm talking anxious about opening letters, checking whatsapp and shit so thats gotta be related to that stuff. I was on a ridiculous streak last spring until summer, when I rolled almost every weekend for like 4 months until I took a break for final law exams (which I hopefully passed lol). obviously rolled hard as fuck after last exams and another time this weekend. I'm going to see Rodhad and his Dystopian crew at my favorite club here in the area. So actually tempted to roll again but it's time to learn raving without that shit. it isn't really that I'm "addicted" to mdma, its more like I'm a huge fan of electronic music and that combined with mdma... I mean you prolly know what I mean. anyways, taking a break till exams results are published (february) :) thanks brother</TEXT>

    <TEXT>probably 100% in Flatout Ultimate Carnage on xbox 360. I slightly remember, it was one of the very last races which was ridiculously difficult on the hardest difficulty. it was only a min or two but I played it for days until I actually did it. Was proud as fuck getting that 1000 GS in that game back in the day lol. now years later being on the pc, I couldn't care less about achievements and all that stuff xD. thankfully tbh</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Hey brothers and sisters, I'm really interested in going to Rodhad's "10 Years Dystopian Tour" alongside Monoloc and Ron Albrecht at Robert Johnson Club next week [https://www.residentadvisor.net/events/1348175](https://www.residentadvisor.net/events/1348175) Problem is, I might not be able to make it earlier than 4am. To anyone of you guys who has been at one of his gigs this fall/winter: when did he play? Closing set or second one? I'd assume he'll be closing the night and starts playing at around 5/6 am till 10am but couldn't find any reliable information. I definitely wanna see his set from the very beginning, definitely interested in Monoloc's set as well (I'm currently listening to this madness here: [https://soundcloud.com/monoloc-smallroom-music/monoloc-berghain-1hour-clr-11](https://soundcloud.com/monoloc-smallroom-music/monoloc-berghain-1hour-clr-11)) but it's really important to me to experience Rodhad's set from the very first second.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>that helps a lot :) I wouldve assumed, he would close the night but your comment killed the last doubts Ive had. lookin forward to it. It's actually the first time I'm gonna listen to techno in this wonderful club. have only been to house nights so far (dont kill me xD). I'm a huge minimal house/minimal techno fan and just recently discovered Rodhad's sound and absolutely been digging it since then.his sound is a bit dubby, so it probably makes sense that a rominimal head likes his sound. thanks</TEXT>

    <TEXT>played every single halo back in the day, so essentially grew up with these games. was lookin forward to this release as well for obvious reasons and can't say I'm disappointed. however, I can't recommend it either at least if youre an enthusiastic gamer. I'm running a pretty beefy setup and I just can't cope with various and obvious issues that will or won't get fixed. fps doesn't feel smooth at all (playing unlimited). I gotta admit I'm pretty sensible to unstable fps but 140fps simply don't feel like 140 fps in this game. it hurts also movement feels ridiculously sluggish. I don't know if Halo Reach just didn't age well or if its an issue within the game but if you're used to modern fps, it's gonna hurt sound is bad yes but it doesn't bother me as much as the fps and movement issues. Listen, it's one of the best fps series ever created and if youre just playing it for the story and especially as a preparation for Halo Infinite, go for it. 10bucks or 40 for the entire collection is probably a steal. but I can't overlook issues just because of a low prize. they bother me as much as they would in a full prized 60 #8364; game.  #8203; my personal recommendation: get yourself a gamepass sub for 1 buck.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>seconded. been a huge minimal fan myself and got absolutely sucked into rominimal. it's become my favorite sound these days, yes even above techno. I wanna add some absolutely great artists as well: on the slower more psychedelic side: Rhadoo and Petr Inspirescu (check their Dommunes on youtube, great sets) more towards techno with a very distinct sound: SIT (Cristi Cons b2b Vlad Caia), probably my favorite duo in electronic music. crazy talented like zenzerodetroid said: def check out Priku. this guy is actually insane. my favorite dj these days is a french guy called Janeret. definitely more house than minimal but such a psychedelic yet groovy sound.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>not saying it's good to take it as many times as you did but holy fuck the paranoia on this sub regarding molly more than once every 3 months is real. I've had some rather stupid streaks in my life, when I took molly pretty much every weekend for several months and here I am still alive and had final exams in german law just 6 weeks ago. have I lost the magic? maybe?! I still get ejected into space when I roll while raving. Did I become a vegetable? don't feel any different tbh. comedowns are usually longer than they used to be. happens that I feel sad for a week. it's obviously for the best of you if you don't overuse it but man, the amount of threads like: did I fuck up my life because I did molly two times in one month" are actually quite hilarious.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I think you missed the point of this amorf set. It was a chill, moody set to hang with, have a lil talk with like minded people at day time and for that very occasion I though that set was pretty fucking amazing. It was never supposed to be a banging set. Suggesting that cristi cons alongside vlad caia who literally is one of the most talented rominimal artists out there is part of your so called inevolution of the Romanian sound is quite frankly impressive. As I find them to have one of the more unique sounds in this genre Besides I think there #8217;s many many insanely talented dudes out there. Caps already been mentioned. Listen to his guesthouse set. Priku is still on another level for me but then again I jut can #8217;t grow tired of the Romanian sound ( might be because I #8217;ve been listening to it for only 2 years. But then again over the years I #8217;ve shifted to the French scene quite a bit as well. Think janeret got one of the dopest minimal House sounds these days. It was me posting that amorf set btw</TEXT>

I'm curious though. Have you listened to Rhadoo's latest dommune set? I'd be interested to know how it stacks up against his earlier dommunes especially the one from 2017 in your opinion? have you listened to Cap's Guesthouse podcast? what do you think about that one?</TEXT>

I mean you know what I'm talking about. and for the very same reason I would consider 2-CB. based on your comments, I'd assume that 2-CB is prolly the best for a minimal/ dub techno rave whereas it's maybe less ideal for a proper techno rave. definitely gonna try it for the next ro-minimal rave as that music is prolly the most hypnotizing and psychedelic electronic music I listen to.

    <TEXT>I don #8217;t. The main reason is, I #8217;m super into electronic music and there #8217;s usually 1 event per month I really wanna experience. I do however limit it to 1 roll per month after having a pretty crazy time last spring till late summer when I had rolled pretty much every weekend for at least 4 months. And no I haven #8217;t lost the magic. Not now and not in this crazy period. comedowns were longer and lasted up until a full week. I do eat really healthy though and do sports every day. I don #8217;t know how much of a factor that is regarding Minimizing the effects of such a stupid abuse. i think if you limit it to 1 roll every 2 months you #8217;re good to go just don #8217;t be as stupid as i was and take it every week because that certainly can #8217;t be good lol. I redose on every roll, usually twice since raves last till at least 10am here in Germany.</TEXT>

Crazy vibe, not so many tourists and a dope venue. If you decide to go there you should definitely check who #8217;s playing because bouncers might ask you a few questions. Shelter is also pretty dope. I checked RA and saw that Joseph capriati is playing. Big name, personally not my thing but decide for yourself. De Marktkantine is also pretty cool, easier to get into. If I was you, I #8217;d go to Doka. Never been there but rhadoo is playing and rhadoo is fuckin sick as hell. Never been To that venue, if you like minimal/ minimal house,I #8217;d def check it out.

It's this sick combination of sick grooves while simultaneously being super deep and trippy. regarding electronic music, I always recommend listening to entire sets rather than playlists with random songs. it's the journey of a whole set that makes it so crazy hypnotizing especially on a roll. here's a really dope set of one of my favorite rominimal artists. maybe you like it as much as I do.

    <TEXT> #8203; well since you\` re in Germany anyways, I'd definitely come over to Frankfurt/Offenbach for a night and visit Robert Johnson Club. I quite honestly think that this club is the best club in the world and surpasses pretty much every club I've been to, which includes Berlin obviously. check their program and come for someone you like. it's definitely worth coming to this shithole of a city called offenbach lol  #8203; EDIT: not saying you should move there obviously lol</TEXT>

    <TEXT>depends on the event I'd say. the more packed it is, the more she selects, might ask questions regarding the event. "who's playing?" "have you been here?" "what kind of music is he producing"...you know the deal. shouldn't come in a bigger group than 2 either. I usually don't go to the extremely packed events. need my space on the dancefloor lol. but definitely check it out. you're gonna love it. Tanzhaus West isn't too bad either lol. it's a bit too druggy for my liking. crazy place though</TEXT>

    <TEXT>nothing to do with the slower bpm unless youre talking about boiler room in particular (which is almost always trash compared to proper clubnights) this whole event looked like some milan fashion week afterparty. I'd bet most of the people in the crowd haven't been to an actual techno party in their whole life. been to various minimal house, minimal/dub techno clubnights in germany and the netherlands it was as wild as you'd imagine a hard and dark techno party</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Can only agree with this. Robert Johnson is by far my favorite club and I #8217;ve seen a lot. Ridiculous soundsystem, good prizes, absolute top notch crowd, I love the  #8222;balcony #8220;; experienced some hilarious shit there but also had really cool conversations. Wooden floor is absolutely underrated. And I just love that intimate feeling in the club. Crowd is super close to the dj booth. It #8217;s just dope. one thing to consider: Friday is usually house/ minimal, Saturday techno. Can be different at times but that #8217;s how it is most of the time. Just check program online.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Ye I #8217;ve heard a lot about what you just said lol. I mean I #8217;ve basically seen enough on YouTube and social media to know it #8217;s something I #8217;d definitely be annoyed by ( so maybe there actually is something good about phones lol). I might go to mioritmic for two days next October. Heard good things about cluj itself and obviously about mioritmic. This or epizode in Vietnam depending on whether I passed my final exams and gonna have a job soon or not lol. I do have to say though that the older I get the more I appreciate the intimate clubs I #8217;m going to here. If you ever in Germany, make sure to visit my favorite club Robert Johnson. They #8216;ve been booking rominimal artists pretty regularly ( cap ejected me into space last August). I #8217;d definitely be down to meet up, so don #8217;t hesitate to msg me. fun story btw lol. I always say there #8217;s a thin line between responsible drug usage and just plain fucked up junkie behavior. There #8217;s usually both scenes to be had here. I avoid clubs as soon as being high is more important to the scene than the music itself. Anyway good talk and thanks for your reply</TEXT>

    <TEXT>highly recommend checking out the romanian minimal sound ("rominimal") I'm in the same boat as you for the most part. Never really got into hard hitting super fast techno. rominimal combines a lot of different genres depending on the dj. there sure is a lot of same-y sounding stuff but standout artists deliver creative stuff for the most part. since I really like deep, hypnotic but yet groovy sound, I totally fell in love with the romanian sound. highly recommend checking out a.)

    <TEXT>DeWalta is incredible, very versatile as well both a good producer and dj. Got to know a lot of his tracks being played by rominimal artists. Been playing a lot of techno heavy stuff too as of late. I actually really liked his boiler room liveset with Shannon. they played at sunwaves21 too and it was definitely more minimal House, consider that. I saw John dimas two weeks ago. Good stuff, definitely rather house than techno. If you #8217;re as much of a house fan as I am, you #8217;ll have a great time</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I dont know if its me getting older and not digging trap and all its subgenres at all or if it really comes down to the scene giving me less and less of that conscious hiphop sound I've been loving for many many years (I'm 31 and listened to hiphop since the day I "stole" my dads "gangster's paradise compilations in the 90s" and bought tupac "greatest hits" as a 11 year old) but maan, I've been listening to less and less hiphop. "Bandana" was amazing and a couple of other projects were pretty dope (loved Anderson Paaks project) too but I've gotten into the electronic scene, even bought some turntables and started mixing for fun and been absolutely in love with the scene and everything around it. here's to hoping for a new Kendrick and Isaiah Rashad project. Would also love a new JCole lp. I need more projects I can sink my teeth into. you know, some stuff you listen to for the 100th time and still notice something new.

    <TEXT>Check the Romanian sound ( rominimal) it #8217;s basically its own minimal sub-genre. There #8217;s also a subreddit called romaniansound. Might be worth checking it out. There #8217;s so many artists to recommend, but based on your track you #8216;ll probably like SIT ( cristi Cons b2b vlad caia), Cap ( doesn #8217;t produce but is an insanely gifted DJ), Nu Zau, Vlad Arapasu. I highly recommend listening to Priku ( https://soundcloud.com/clubguesthousero/gh003-priku Also Rhadoos dommune set from 2017 on YouTube is a masterpiece as well https://youtu.be/dBRUADJ4eNk if you #8217;re graving a warmer, more groovy sound, check Arapu and Gescu i could link you a bunch of songs but this whole genre is so rich, I much rather wanna recommend to listen to some sets on SoundCloud and check the commentsection for specific tracks. More often than not it #8217;s the journey through a whole set that makes this genre so dope. If you need any further recommendations, feel free to message me edit: There #8217;s a couple of really good YouTube channels for this genre. UFO Beats, rayzeh are pretty good for this stuff</TEXT>

    <TEXT>personally it's all I listen to for several reasons. 1.) if there's one music genre that greatly benefits from sets than it is house/techno or electronic music as a whole. good DJ's have the gift to send you on a journey, to actually tell a story purely by mixing tracks. for me personally, this art of storytelling is what differentiates topnotch DJs from average ones. 2.) it's my number 1 way of finding songs I like and wanna buy on vinyl as well. I'm only a bedroom DJ. I enjoy mixing for fun and get lost in the rhythm and music. it's actually part of the fun for me, trying to ID specific tracks, communicate with people on soundcloud and such. 3.) mixes are my number 1 indicator whether I wanna see a specific DJ play or not. 4.) it's perfect for gym-time  #8203; there's probably a lot more to it</TEXT>

    <TITLE>What can I expect from a Mall Grab clubnight in 2020?</TITLE>
    <DATE>2020-01-13 14:24:57</DATE>
    <TEXT>Hey guys, wanna make it short. Basically Mall Grab is playing at Robert Johnson alongside Willow this upcoming weekend. I know a lot of his uplifting House stuff (which I like) and also know that his past sets from like 2016+ were housy for the most part. Now, referring to his latest Boiler Room and Glitch Festival sets it tend to be a lot more electro and techno, but usually a lot of different genres packed in one. Now I'm generally not against either of those. I love techno, I'm also a big house fan, not so much of an electro fan but I usually don't like several genres mixed into one set. Most importantly though, I wanna know what to expect from a clubnight I plan on going to. here for anyone interested: [https://www.residentadvisor.net/events/1363939](https://www.residentadvisor.net/events/1363939) Anyone seen him lately?</TEXT>

I mean, it's a singleplayer game anyways. it's not like you miss out on something when you play the game a few months later lol. call me crazy, but I actually sold my 2080ti two weeks ago and will be without a gpu till next gen release. felt like I was wasting money having this super expensive gpu in my pc without playing games ( because let's be real: theres literally nothing to play right now) and waiting till april when new gpus are probably around the corner. I expect a way bigger jump from the 20series to the 30series than from 1080ti to the 20series (did that upgrade path and felt like the jump wasn't worth it)</TEXT>

    <TEXT>upgraded from a 1080ti to a 2080ti a year ago. thought that Metro Exodus was pretty damn impressive and is prolly the most immersive game I've played in my life (partly due to RTX). performance hit was actually pretty alright (except maybe forest level) Control's graphics and rtx features were pretty good as well, game bored me to death after a while though. also thought the game didn't look as good as people made it out, it's insanely blurry, with a lot of "visual noise". the performance hit on 1440p was insane as well. didn't bother with other games. If I were you, I'd really ask myself whether I have to play the currently available rtx games. if you consider an rtx gpu for next gen games (cyberpunk, Doom etc), I'd probably wait for ampere as next gen is supposed to be a lot better than the current one. now, do I think the upgrade was worth the 1300 #8364;? definitely not. shouldve just kept my 1080ti.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>ye I don't know why I didn't like the game as much as I expected. I'm a big Remedy fan but Control felt like it was being weird just for the sake of being weird. hard to explain. also the gameplay loop was a bit too easy. you could basically spam telekinesis all the time while hiding behind your cover. I dunno. I'm old (31) lol. not as easy to impress me as it used to be. the game looked good. don't get me wrong and the RTX features themselves were really impressive. the game as a whole was a bit underwhelming. but yeah, like you said, thats totaly subjective</TEXT>

I respect him a lot. he's one of the reasons why the romanian scene (which is by far my favorite these days) is as big as it is right now. I also own a couple of EPs of his. but whenever I've seen him playing lately, it was just a lot of suuper weird edits. not my typa shit. probably depends a lot on how fucked up he is on a specific day lol. also he attracts weird people. I don't wanna hate but I've never seen so many phone wielders at Robert Johnson even though there's a "no phones on the dancefloor policy". never again lol.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I'm living close to Mannheim. Mannheim itself got hit pretty hard just recently with the forced closure of Parker Lewis. one of only two techno/house focused clubs in the city. the other one, Disko 2, isn't really worth considering. It got some pretty decent bookings here and then (minimalistica) but basically nothing I'd ever prefer over taking the train to Robert Johnson. now the city itself is pretty cool. I've never been a fan of insanely big cities but Mannheim is kinda in a sweetspot. got that big city vibes but also a lot of parks, Altstadt, and that kinda cozy vibe with a a lot of cultural stuff as well. like ezymnz already said, it's basically in the middle of a big urban area with Frankfurt am Main really close (one of Germany's richest cities). now, talking about Frankfurt regarding techno is a whole nother story. Robert Johnson has been considered as one of the world's best clubs for quite a while. and honestly imo it is. now I haven't been to many outside of Germany but compared to Berlin, it's definitely on the same level, if not even better. crazy soundsystem, all the bookings youre looking for with a big emphasis on house/minimal though. I don't even hesitate to take the 90min train to the club because I know I'll be having a magical night there. FFM got a few amount of other decent clubs. Tanzhaus West is well known, much more techno focused, but imo a bit too fucked up lol. to each his own though. Off Yard and Silbergold are also decent venues. now back to Mannheim being in a big urban area, there's really a lot to that area and easy to arrive with train. Worth mentioning is that, Mannheim's got a huuge US background with one of the biggest US army bases in the country being in Mannheim. it generally is a very international city. I can't remember a single day in the city when I haven't heard at least one person speaking english if music culture is your priority, I don't think youre gonna be disappointed. now personally, I'd have a hard time passing on Madrid. the weather, the food, the chicks... maybe I'm just biased towards something different since I'm a german, who been living his whole life in Germany lol. don't think you'd regret either of those choices though. have fun. and if you actually come to Mannheim, feel free to msg me if you don't wanna solo rave at Robert Johnson.</TEXT>

Obviously good bookings don #8217;t mean good and enthusiastic crowds filled with people that know what they like. But based on your comment it seems to be in a good spot and got the potential to become even better. Now the 3 am thing is something to get used to when you #8217;re used to raving till 9 or 10 am lmfao but then again it #8217;s probably time to say goodbye to that crazy raver of myself anyways lol.

    <TEXT>yes, saw him at Robert Johnson few months ago, didn't stay long (danced my ass off to Rhadoo's set for 5hrs). Mixing is one thing but I simply cannot stand his weird edits. I seriously do not understand the hype he gets nowadays.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>fully agreed. I respect him a lot especially as a producer. He #8217;s also one of the reasons why the Romanian sound is as popular as it is now but yeah...the quality of a Ricardo set heavily depends on how fucked up he is on that day lol. Not my thing personally, but apparently people still dig his sound a lot. Though I #8217;m not quite sure if these people are rather going for Ricardo himself than the music he plays.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>bit off-topic, since you were mainly asking for club advice but I wanna take the time and encourage you to actually do it. it's honestly the best thing I did in the last couple of years. I had been partying with the same group for many many years. good friends don't get me wrong but they never jumped on the techno/house train as much as I did a couple of years ago. and when they actually did join me, it usually ended with one of them wanting to go home at fuckin 5am (I'm german, so they basically wanted to bail when the main-act started his set lol) or generally standing at the bar because they didn't feel the music to dance as much as I do. It started to bother me, so I went out solo for the first time and from that night on, I refused to go out with the homies several time. I simply prefer going alone. you'd much rather meet new, interesting, funny people. You can dance as long as you want without feeling the pressure of making your friends happy, because you were the guy who decided to go to that specific club in the first place. I stayed till 10am, 11am up until the club closed... the best I'm tellin ya. so don't hesitate. it's awesome (I'm 31 btw)</TEXT>

I mean I really enjoy watching it from time to time, having a nice little talk with some like-minded people in the chat but would I prefer this over a club-night? no way man. boring crowds most of the time, 1h sets (which only very few can fully take advantage of \[ I'm thinking Rodhad's 2016 Berlin BR for example) and they end earlier than your standard club night. If it was free or at least work with some sort of invite-through-application-process I might consider it. but I really don't need more phone wielders and attention seekers than I'm already forced to party with lol.</TEXT>

    <TITLE>I'm lookin for appropriate literature for beginners with an emphasis on stress/sleep issues</TITLE>
    <DATE>2020-02-17 13:39:21</DATE>
    <TEXT>Hey guys, I've been following this sub for a few days now. A few days ago I received a letter that really made me realize I have to change things. Let me introduce myself and further explain what I mean. I'm 31 man, studied and graduated in german law a couple of years ago,before I started what we basically call "preparatory service". A mandatory 2 years with different stations at different courts before you have another final "state exams". If you pass this one, you're finally what we call "Volljurist"; a jurist qualified to become judge, state attorney, lawyer etc. Well, I didn't pass this 2nd state exams. It's the first time in my life that I haven't passed en exam/test. But if I'm totally honest, it should've happened earlier, because the main issue has always been the same: I cannot fuckin sleep prior to big events. It usually ends with panic attacks, where stress gets so ahold of me that even sleep pills wouldn't affect me. Happened before first state exams (the one that finishes your studies), but I passed it. It happened before oral exams, it even happened before work, when I was afraid of not being able to sleep. Now back to the fact, I didn't pass this oh so important 2nd state exams. It isn't the end of it. I do have another last try next autumn and I wanna make sure that this unnecessary issue isn't stopping me to finish what began almost 10 years ago when I started to study this shit. Several people told me about meditation several times, especially guided towards stress relief and sleeping issues. Obviously trying it in the heat of the battle wouldn't work. So I never really gave it a try when I had time to learn it. I wanna read more about this topic and while I obviously have checked amazon for recommendations regarding meditation, the sheer amount of literature makes it hard to decide what really would benefit me. I don't really wanna read 10 books before I know what helps and what not. So, what's your recommended literature. I don't mind stuff with an emphasis on the philosophical background of meditation. However, I think books with an emphasis on the procedure of meditation is probably what I really need or what would at least be a good start to potentially dig further into it.  #8203; Anyways, thank you guys already.  #8203; TL;DR: guy with huge stress/sleep issues the night before important events needs literature recommendations with an emphasis on the procedure of meditation.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I really couldn't have asked for more. this is basically everything I've been looking for. I'll contact one of those MBSR teachers in my area and see whether it's affordable.It might even be covered my health insurance (partly at least). I'll also be lookin into those two books you recommended. I told myself to distance myself from that failed exam for a week or two. gonna use this time to read into that topic. thank you once again.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>as much as I love mdma, I'd really stay away from it on a regular basis. take it once every two months sure, maaaybe once a month if there's really someone you must see but don't get sucked into it. this is from my very own experience, going through a phase of popping E almost every weekend for a solid 5 months and it made me extremely careless and irresponsible regarding my obligations. It was right before my final state exams in german law (which I didn't pass, received results just a few days ago) eductate yourself on neurotoxicity of mdma. it really changes your view on this drug, at least regarding the abuse of it. I think you should be fine with speed every once in a while. as with all things: don't abuse it or it definitely will catch up on you (had a pretty hefty phase back in my school time, had to do 12th grade again due to my weed and speed "addiction). there's one drug, I read a lot about when I was looking for an mdma substitute. that's "3-FPM", really don't know how hard or easy it is to find in Berlin. eductate yourself on it, it might be something for ya if you need a break from those rather toxic stuff.  #8203; last but not least: try raving "sober" every once in a while. it really isn't that bad. the best of the best DJs make you high with their music and only with their music. have a couple of drinks and actually remember the set the next day ( something I kinda hate with xtc lol) Viel Spa #223; in Berlin Edit: agree'd on the exercising and healthy nutrition part. It really does help a lot</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Sup, since I've started to collect vinyl and mix at home for fun, I really started digging deeper into what this scene has to offer. I discovered this guy called Tulbure. you guys who've been in the scene for a long time prolly know him already as some of his stuff has been part of Rhadoo's and other rather famous DJ's sets. I really haven't seen much of him in the grand scheme of things. copped a few EPs of his which I really like [https://soundcloud.com/music-is-art-ltd/sets/mia009-tulbure-alibi-ep](https://soundcloud.com/music-is-art-ltd/sets/mia009-tulbure-alibi-ep) have to say, I'm a big fan of this very minimalistic, hypnotic yet groovy sound. But I really enjoyed his sets on soundcloud as well [https://soundcloud.com/danubebln/danube-podcast-001-tulbure](https://soundcloud.com/danubebln/danube-podcast-001-tulbure) [https://soundcloud.com/lucky-23-sound-system/the-23rd-podcast-13-tulbure-vinyl-mix](https://soundcloud.com/lucky-23-sound-system/the-23rd-podcast-13-tulbure-vinyl-mix) Another name I've stumbled upon in terms of production is "guy from downstairs". especially his productions are top notch groovers.

    <TEXT>not disagreeing but I've always taken mdma for the music enhancement it causes and not because I wanted to get high.basically I've wanted to experience a specific set as intensely as possible. electronic music by itself is obviously dope as hell but mdma takes it on another level. Actually I'm convinced that a lot of producers or DJs create music with MDMA or drug usage in general taken into consideration.</TEXT>

I actually think I wouldn't have fallen in love with techno the way I did, if I hadn't been high on my first raves. it definitely lead to some of the most incredible experiences I've had in my life. nobody can tell me a Rodhad set on MDMA isn't a completely different level of "dope" compared to sober. Now I don't wanna promote this shit and tell everybody to get high. I had to learn the hard way to use that shit responsibly. however, I always look forward to my "once-every-3-month-roll".</TEXT>

    <TEXT>if you have an instagram, I'd follow your most favorite producers/djs. one guy, who's associated with most of the scene there is asuciu (initially thought it's THE Suciu lol). he's an eventmanager who posts mosts of the really dope ass parties few weeks/months in advance. Following "Trommel" is prolly a good choice too. It's to them I found this party, which I'm gonna travel to from Germany next month. [https://trommelmusic.com/events/dubla-spring-breakers/](https://trommelmusic.com/events/dubla-spring-breakers/) I haven't been to either Sunwaves or Mioritmic. but from what I've been told and what I've seen Mioritmic looks like the way more mature festival. Heard really good things about the city of Cluj too. so this might me worth a look for ya. I was planning on going this year but the dumbass that I am, I didn't pass state exams, so I have to go again this october to fight for my life lol. sucks the more I looked into sunwaves (because I initially was blown away by it too) the more I wanted to avoid it. vibe looks off. too many phones, too many young drugheads who aren't there for the music. ah another big one that comes into my mind is this one here. haven't been to it though.

However, Robert Johnson is still my favorite club in the country and actually my favorite club in the world. the soundsystem is better than most if not any soundsystem in Berlin (except Berghain), I love the intimate feeling of the club, love the people, love the terasse. it's a wonderful club and I've never regretted spending almost 40 bucks and 2hrs of time for the train to Offenbach and back home to Mainz. if you haven't been there, wait for a DJ you like and go there. its worth</TEXT>

Caught him at Robert Johnson, played after rhadoo ( which I fuckin love) from like 5am till 12 pm. A lot of weird edits. It couldn #8217;t grab me even though I was high.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Robert Johnson is generally speaking just a prime example of how a dancefloor should be built. DJ booth is on the same level as dancefloor, no sort of barrier between booth and dancefloor, causing this really intimate feeling. It just feels like DJ and crowd is one unit and I lost count of how many magic moments I've had due to this intimate feeling. Saw Maayan Nidam couple of months ago, it was 7am, she played a super deep cut, had my eyes shut while dancing,opened my eyes and she was lookin me right into the eyes for a splitsecond. made my night tbh. I'd definitely miss this personal connection between both DJ and crowd, if there wasn't a DJ behind the booth. It would feel just like those boring hiphop parties I used to go when I was young and didn't know this magic called techno. the way it is, it really feels like a journey and the DJ decides where you're heading</TEXT>

Unfortunately my friends don't dig it as much as I do. when we were introduced to the scene like two years ago, It was only me who got addicted to it. these goddamn normies prefer going to latina nights or some shit like that lol. they also don't get when I tell them, a techno event is much more than a party for me....either way, it is what it is and I definitely love solo-raving but I miss these few raves with my homies.</TEXT>

Since then I've gradually fallen in love with it more and more until it became my prefered way of raving at least under the given circumstances. My friends aren't really that much into the music. they did wanna join me here and then but it usually ended with them wanting to leave at around 5-6, which is basically when the headliners are playing here in Germany. obviously would love to have friends, sharing the same mindset but it is what it is. met some cool raving buddies but it's not really the same as having your best friends around you. anyways, just do it.

    <TEXT>definitely agreed on the rominimal recommendation but wouldn't say that Barac, Praslea and Rhadoo have got a "warm" sound. infact Rhadoo is the absolute master of dark minimal, Praslea also rather on the minimalistic/dark-ish side of rominimal. raresh is definitely a good choice. if OP is lookin for warm/summer vibe rominimal I'd personally recommend Arapu ( [https://soundcloud.com/clubguesthousero/gh010-arapu?in=clubguesthousero/sets/club-guesthouse-podcast-series](https://soundcloud.com/clubguesthousero/gh010-arapu?in=clubguesthousero/sets/club-guesthouse-podcast-series) ) Gescu ( https://youtu.be/E38SykPlB-c ) and some of the lesser known: VincentIulian [https://soundcloud.com/trommelmusic/trommel082-vincentiulian](https://soundcloud.com/trommelmusic/trommel082-vincentiulian) Guy from downstairs [https://soundcloud.com/halfisenough/gfd-introspections-2](https://soundcloud.com/halfisenough/gfd-introspections-2) maybe even the likes of caLLy [https://soundcloud.com/sunriseagency/sunrise-hub-live-studio-session\_02-cally](https://soundcloud.com/sunriseagency/sunrise-hub-live-studio-session_02-cally)</TEXT>

    <TEXT>by far Cap (romanian minimal/house) at Robert Johnson last August. granted the romanian sound is by far my favorite house variation these days but this guy's technical abilities (mixing, beatmatching, phrasing etc) is just soo good, it was one of the rare moments a DJ got me into a different state. Dana Ruh played an awesome deep house set from 6-9am as well. overall one of the most magical nights I've had in a club.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>it's definitely influenced by dub techno yea. When I discovered the romanian sound I really thought it had the perfect mix of deep house, minimal, and dub techno. upon first impression you would think that most of the romanians sound same-y but most of them do actually have a unique sound if you listen carefully. ranges from really really dark (rhadoo's 2017 dommune is a perfect example) to really warm and groovy house (Arapu, Gescu, Raresh) I've spent almost a year digging through the sound, been to a couple of rominimal raves across europe and I'm not even close of being bored by it :)</TEXT>

    <TEXT>same here in the Frankfurt area. Robert Johnson, Tanzhaus and other clubs in this area closed and talked about the financial issues it will cause for a lot of clubs (especially independent ones) " Many clubs have or are about to close temporarily. It's a situation which puts the night economy in dire straits: no gigs, no money. Independent clubs like Robert Johnson run on a tight budget  #8211; if there's no income to be generated, it might be the end of it.

    <TEXT>actually an accumulation of different factors 1.) I was (part of me still is) a huge hiphop head but going to concerts and events here in Germany never gave me that feeling of being surrounded by likeminded people rather than just a whole lot of different people that werent necessarily there for the music. and I'm the typa person who loves to talk about the shit I'm passionate about.also hiphop got really fuckin weird over these last couple of years with trap and this mumble shit taking over leading to less and less bookings and events of the artists I've been digging. first couple of clubnights gave me that incredible feeling of being surrounded by people who are as passionate about music as I am. immediately got addicted to this scene. 2) drugs now don't get me wrong. when I go to a rave/clubnight I go for the music. but MDMA kinda served as that initiating push. the first couple of times I listened to techno was always on drugs. once I got addicted (to the music), I obviously started listening to it sober. but this combination still is something special to me. 3.) minimal/house. without minimal/house, especially the romanian stuff I would've never made that "next step". I think it's a lot more accessible than techno. It also proved to be true that you often start with slow stuff and listen to harder and faster stuff later on :) 4.) Rodhad my first techno rave. still is my favorite.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I don't know, I guess it creates more of an intimate, personal vibe. think about that incredible set of Helena Hauff for boiler room. sure the set itself was dope af but what I loved even more is her vibe. she dancing her ass off in casual pants, drinking beer, smoking hand-rolled cigs, records all over the floor. It was awesome. now compare that to her club quarantine set which was dope too but I was bored by the visual presentation of it.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>so our government (Germany) just decided that major events ("Gro #223;veranstaltungen") are banned till at least August,31. That means festivals won't happen in germany and probably in the rest of EU either. it's up to the german states to define what a "major event" is and what isnt and ultimately decide whether we could experience a clubnight in the near future or not. sad times.</TEXT>

Berlin's senate decided today that: 1.) major events with more than 5000 attendees are cancelled till october 24th 2.) major events with more than 1000 attendees are cancelled till august 31st so that should mean that events with less than a thousand attendees could potentially open earlier than august 31st right? don't see it happen personally but hope is the last thing to die I guess...</TEXT>

    <TEXT>highly recommend checking out the romanian sound, there's a couple of artists that play from extremely minimalistic to really groovy or even melodic stuff. in terms of minimalistic sound I prefer those that are able to deliver minimal but still groovy stuff. 1.) Petre Inspirescu: check out his Dommunes on youtube, they're all incredibly dope [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aqTAVXX9Wj4 amp;t=3473s](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aqTAVXX9Wj4 amp;t=3473s) [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YnWfRYtj3S8 amp;t=769s](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YnWfRYtj3S8 amp;t=769s) 2.) deep into the romanian underground but well known within it: Tulbure [https://soundcloud.com/danubebln/danube-podcast-001-tulbure](https://soundcloud.com/danubebln/danube-podcast-001-tulbure) 3.) Suciu. here's a dope b2b with one my favorite romanians Cap [https://soundcloud.com/trommelmusic/trommel084-cap-b2b-suciu](https://soundcloud.com/trommelmusic/trommel084-cap-b2b-suciu) 4.) Dan Andrei [https://soundcloud.com/xlr8r/xlr8r-podcast-547-dan-andrei](https://soundcloud.com/xlr8r/xlr8r-podcast-547-dan-andrei) and if you want it dark and psychedelic, theres no way around rhadoo [https://youtu.be/dBRUADJ4eNk?t=3556](https://youtu.be/dBRUADJ4eNk?t=3556)</TEXT>

    <TEXT>what a comment this! fully agreed btw. I'm still pretty new to the scene. 31 years old, listened to hiphop for more than 20 years and even though I considered myself enthusiastic and sorta addicted to the music and the digging it didn't even come close to what I felt when I got introduced to the techno and romanian minimal scene. one and a half years later, I'm bedroom dj'ing when I get the time to. bought some turntables, a two channel mixer, some monitors and a shitton of records, not even counting the ridiculous amount of time I spend lookin for new tracks and records I could buy and implement in my "for-my-own-pleasure" mixes at home. It's definitely an addiction and I fuckin love it. I don't even wanna talk about the out of this world parties. we all know it's pure magic and there's definitely part of me who's a bit sad that I found this love in my early 30s now after having finished law studies and starting to work as a jurist with the ridiculous amount of hrs that come with this job. can't wait to get back on the dancefloor.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I'm still a beginner really but I'm quite happy with my reloops 7000 mk2. I've tested 1210s before buying them. obviously would've gotten 1210 if there had been decently prized used ones but at the end I didnt really see a point spending 450 euro for 15+ year old technics when I could get completely new reloops that are actually quite similar in a non club environment. so got two of those with concorde mix mkII twin systems. a xone 23c (because I'm still considering setting up DVS) and... let me tell you a whole lot of records. I actually started buying records way before I got my turntables. it's become such an addiction really. basically ordering at least 5 newly released records a month + used old ones I cant get on deejay/decks anymore. It's a lot of fun though both the digging and the playing and learning process.</TEXT>

I hope that clubs might work something out and can host some sort of small scale outdoor events.

    <TEXT>I'm not from the UK either. living close to Frankfurt,germany, so pretty fortunate to have Robert Johnson in my area. you do mention an interesting point though. I came to the conclusion that the more popular the DJs the less I like the vibe. as much as I love rhadoo (and he still is my favorite romanian dj), I've seen him play twice and both times the vibe was average compared to a clubnight with lesser known romanians like Cap. still enjoyed myself because the music was dope but there was definitely more people that weren't as big into rominimal, just happened to be there because they've heard the name "rhadoo". dude, it actually blows my mind why you guys don't have a better club scene, given the insane talent thats coming from France. some of my favorite djs/producers are from Paris.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>this is what I love about the romanian sound tho. I feel like it got a bit of everything. pretty convinced everybody can find at least one romanian whose sound is exactly what he's lookin for. it covers a pretty wide range of different sounds. everybody who says the romanians sound all the same really got no clue. my personal taste really changed over the years, I was big into the more housy romanians first, but been getting more into the more minimal DJs. really digging Crihan these days. if you havent seen his Sunrise hub set, do yourself a favor and watch it. it's a nice trip. and ye Cap...I think he's gonna be one of the greatest in a couple of years. dude's got insane flow imo. gotta dig more into Herodot's sound man.

    <TEXT>honestly if you dig rominimal, I'd listen to Rodhad. his sound is as trippy and hypnotic as the top tier romanians. he's got groove and insane story telling skill. Club Quarant #228;ne set is a dope start to get into his style.his Boiler Room 2015 Berlin set is a pretty insane one as well. ( [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WiOG0Ov12wY amp;t=350s](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WiOG0Ov12wY amp;t=350s) ) he was my introduction to techno after years of rominimal (still love it, just a smaller pool of romanians I still dig)</TEXT>

    <TITLE>Having issues with a used reloop 7000 mk2 I just got - grinding noises</TITLE>
    <DATE>2020-07-04 13:31:01</DATE>
    <TEXT>Hey guys, I just received a used reloop 7000 mk2 but I'm hearing some sort of "grinding noise" coming from the platter (or rather the connection between the platter and the motor). I can't really locate what exactly causes it. the platter definitely doesn't rotate smoothly,especially compared to the other reloop I'm having. obviously it's possible that I got scammed. seller says, it was definitely working flawlessly. so before I make any assumptions I wanna make sure that I'm not being stupid and missing something. Has anyone of you guys had similar issues? I can make some videos if that explains my issues better. but like I said, basically platter isn't really connected to the turntable. anything I can do to fix it? could the magnet be the issue?</TEXT>

    <TEXT>yep, platter was removed. it's a bit of a weird one, there's moments where I barely hear it and then it's pretty noticeable (as in a split second of grinding noise). also I'm not entirely sure if it slows down the record or not ( as fucked up as it is, I can somehow live with it as long as I can mix without issues). anyway, your comment helps a bit. I might check the motor and see if I can fix it.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Sup everybody, hope you're doing fine all things considered, I finally wanna record my first vinyl only sets. I'm having a xone 23c mixer, but apparently people reporting that recording isn't as simple as it seemed to me, as some of the recording tools would only record one channel rather than the master output?! Now obviously I wanna record my master. What's the recommended app? I hear audacity is alright?  #8203; anything else I should be aware of? What are the connections between mixer and pc supposed to look like? via USB right? I do have a budget audio interface here? is it recommended to use that for recording?  #8203; thanks and stay safe</TEXT>

    <TEXT>You should know that he is referring to minimal scene rather than techno. Granted the Romanian sound is my favorite sound these days but its not for everyone especially for those who like it fast, hard and aggressive. If you haven #8217;t listened to any of it, I definitely recommend checking it out though. also sunwaves is garbage. One of the last festivals I #8216;d visit again. Got too big for its own sake. Basically no room to dance especially when the most well known Romanians are playing. Way too many phones, weird crowd ( as in too much talking, too little dancing, mostly very young people who are there to get high) it #8217;s just too tourist-y imo). mioritmic though is awesome.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Hey, hope you're all doing fine all things considered. Besides my love for proper banging techno, I'm also a big sucker for good minimal techno, especially from the ro scene. However I've been having a hard time finding what I really look for. a lot of newer stuff is pretty " high hatty" and is more minimal-house than straight up minimal. as a reference: big fan of rhadoos, dubtil's, crihan's and VID's style. phat basslines, little to no high hats, deep, dark, hypnotic, not too abstract. basically like this here: [https://youtu.be/ihU0VzGccz4?t=139](https://youtu.be/ihU0VzGccz4?t=139) or this [https://youtu.be/m\_ZqqtvNt0I?t=64](https://youtu.be/m_ZqqtvNt0I?t=64) or this [https://soundcloud.com/afterhours-uk-au/a1-vid-versavice-afhr002#t=0:38](https://soundcloud.com/afterhours-uk-au/a1-vid-versavice-afhr002#t=0:38) Haven't asked in the official minimal subreddit. pretty sure they'd hit me with Villalobos, which I'm not lookin for.</TEXT>

Raresh is too spacy. Pedro's style is more what I'm lookin for. I've gone through his Dommunes which are all insane but obviously most of this is unreleased and will probably always be lmfao. Sunwaves sets tend to be very high hatty for the most part, which makes sense. need that high energy stuff there. Rhadoos sunwaves from 2012 is one of my alltime faves of sunwaves though. basically, I want the raw tracks. going through the sets (and I'm pretty sure Ive listened to every set of those artists you mentioned) is going to end in tears because I wont get the IDs lmao. thanks man.</TEXT>

What #8217;s with your favorite djs/producers? i miss raving as much as you but ignoring the current situation ain #8217;t the way to go.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Yea catching covid and infecting numerous people a week later. Sounds like a plan. If people keep behaving the way they are, there won #8217;t be a scene to look forward to anymore  #128077; #127996;</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I feel like my mental health is taking a huge hit lately. I was really hoping there'd be some light at the end of the tunnel come october/november but it seems like this shitshow is starting all over again, also some f'ed up papers from scientists saying that even when vaccines are available shit won't change for quite a while. I obviously understand it and respect it. for someone who really only socialized at raves and kinda stopped going out with my "normie friends", I just don't see anything to look forward to? I keep thinking: if this situation isnt any different next summer, surely it will fuck the whole scene. will there even be anything left once we're past this whenever this will be? shit's just fucked up man. I should probably stop reading the newspaper and checking news, hoping there'd be the news we're all waiting for. it prolly won't come in a long time...</TEXT>

    <TEXT>You #8217;re right ofc but just thinking my favorite club in the country would close its doors forever, is an absolute nightmare. Those clubs I go to are more than just some random clubs tbh. Or the djs I listen to are more than just SOME random djs that can be replaced by some other random Dj. It #8217;s gonna be all fine I guess</TEXT>

    <TEXT>this pretty much. never touched anything other than event listing, serving me as some sort of rave schedule book and obviously ticket purchasing. couple of interesting articles here and there. but I've never really understood the purpose of music reviews.

    <TEXT>similar-ish sound too? I'm definitely a bit biased towards Rodhad since his sound is exactly my taste: dark-ish, trippy techno, with a bit of groove and not too fast. would def check out some DVS1 stuff if its even remotely close to rodhads sound</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I'll check it out. I can't really pinpoint what is that makes rodhads sound so dope to my ears. obviously totally subjective but while I do enjoy different sounds too, none came close to the goosebumps-totally-somewhere-else-experience I had when I saw him live. it's the perfect molly music too, which prolly formed my strong opinion quite a bit as well lmao. anyways, I'll check your stuff out. thank you</TEXT>

    <TEXT>what a location that. checked those clips on instagram. one thing I've always been jealous of as a german is your guys' scenery. can't even imagine the magic that is some of those spots. pretty nice scene in general. been to supermarket once as I'm a big fan of the romanians and that club is one of THE spots for rominimal in europe. nice club, just way too expensive. switzerland generally is just mad lol</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I respect that. it's also a way to support the (local) scene I guess. however, I'm just sort of a "all or nothing" kinda guy. I wanna get high, dance with people as close as possible till 11am, I want absolute madness as soon as I enter this room. the owner of my favorite club here in the country did an interesting interview about why he won't open until the full experience is possible and his view on this whole social distanced raving. interesting read tbh https://www.residentadvisor.net/features/3757</TEXT>

    <TEXT>get one of those super OEM decks. they're great value for the money. I'm no veteran by any means, I've only been spinning on my reloop 7000 mk2 for a year now, tried 1200s at a friend's place too and I really don't see a point copping 10-15 yo technics for the money of a new reloop 7000, when they are actually of a really similar-ish quality, especially in a non-club-environment. I feel like the pitch control can be a bit fiddly at times, meaning it does get out of sync after a while, but thats nothing I can't work with. check some reviews on yt comparing technics to those reloops for further information :)</TEXT>
