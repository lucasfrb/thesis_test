    <TEXT>I had told so many people about my depression but eventually I do feel like everyone stopped hearing it. What I finally did was pick the person I trusted most and explained in graphic detail the suicidal thoughts I was having, how bad it actually was, how close I have felt sometimes. Then I followed it up with telling them that I knew I needed help but didn #8217;t feel capable of doing it myself. If you have health insurance your first step is going to be your pcm. If you don #8217;t have health care the suicide help line will be able to direct you to the help you need. I really hope everything works out for you. I got the help I needed and I didn #8217;t even know I could feel this okay.</TEXT>

I did it when my dad taught me and the three time I have had a flat since then, I was in a car with other women who didn #8217;t believe I could do it and called triple A, was in the car with a man who didn #8217;t know how and called triple A, and started to do it myself before a man pulled over and insisted he do it for me. I guess it #8217;s nice to know I can but nobody will let me.</TEXT>

You had a gun pulled on you for setting off a house alarm, which yes was an overreaction, but you didn #8217;t have a gun pulled on you for simply existing in your own neighborhood. You don #8217;t have to convince the cops and your neighbors and everyone around you that you #8217;re a good person. It #8217;s assumed that you are unless you give reason for people to suspect otherwise. Last, being told to go back to where you came from for out of state plates is not even vaguely similar to American citizens being told to go back to where they came from based off the color of their skin.

If they have any room for you there you have to live there. You can not turn it down. Even if the commute is awful. If they do not have room for you you can either live off base or wait for room on base but you do not stay at the top of the list. It is not recommended that you wait.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I definitely get how it #8217;s annoying but there is a point to separating the words. People try to use  #8220; black people are just as racist #8221; as a reason not to address the systemic problems that effect the black community in the US. So by separating the words they take that excuse. Personally I think it would #8217;ve worked better to leave the word racism alone and continually stress the effects of systematic racism.</TEXT>

As far as the Native American woman goes I think that would depend on you #8217;re own feelings and experiences with Native American people. If it was a stereotypical native woman then it could be a fear of being taken away by something you see as other. If you know native americans who live by a different life style then you it could be something abstract as life choices drawing you away from responsibilities.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Yaa and they use studies that say strong social safety nets are less popular in countries with more diversity, which is true. But they completely ignore the fact that the reason this is true is people are only fine with social safety nets as long as they are helping people  #8220;like them #8221;. So basically their excuse for not wanting to support these polices is America is too racist... which they would also deny. I get so mad chasing them in their circular logic.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Adult women are trafficked all the time, sometimes human trafficking is kidnapping people and forcing them into sex work but more often human trafficking involves finding women who are vulnerable for any reason and using that vulnerability to coerce them into doing things they #8217;d never normally do. After that they use violence, blackmail, addiction etc to keep them under their foot. This is very possible in the military where any report to command on a soldier can result in them being kicked out.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>You need to sit down and talk to her, when people react strongly to something small it #8217;s usually about something they #8217;ve brought up before and feel like it keeps getting blown off. You said she #8217;s gotten angry with you about prioritizing work before. So ask her when you #8217;re both calm what she means by that and what you #8217;re doing specifically that makes her feel neglected. Then explain how you need to focus on work fully sometimes and that the things she says when she #8217;s angry are very hurtful. You both have valid feelings you just need to take the time to understand each other.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I had been with my boyfriend for 3 months when I got pregnant at 18. My pastor father tried to make us get married. When we refused he tried to make it so my boyfriend wasn #8217;t allowed to be part of mine or the babies life. I went to live with my boyfriends family instead and we got married 3 years later after we both felt like we could commit to forever. We went through some really hard times in those 3 years before we got married, adjusting to new parenthood while being broke and young. I doubt we would have made it if we had been forced to marry earlier. This made me lose faith because I got out and saw how a normal family does things. Life doesn #8217;t have to be a never ending cycle of guilt shame and repentance.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Aziz got me tooed but has largely forgiven because the allegations basically just described an uncomfortably bad date. Lana wrote a tweet complaining about how female artists these days can write all kinds of explicit things with no back lash but she gets backlash to all her music. But when she cited examples they were all black women and Ariana grande. Then she went as far as to say that she had paved the way for these artists to sing whatever they want. Basically people were mad because she was more oppressed than black artists and claimed a legacy that want hers, but really the whole thing just came off as cringe and she seemed like a narcissist. Idk about scar jo though.</TEXT>

Finally after I had my second child I had an ob who actually took interest in how I was doing and I finally got the treatment I needed. I get mad when I see those Facebook posts that say  #8220;if you #8217;re depressed, call me because I #8217;d rather listen to you talk about your depression then go to your funeral. #8221; Because it #8217;s not true. If someone comes to you about their mental health problems listen of corse, but then offer to help find them help, help them make phone calls, help them find clinics they can afford. Trust me even if they turn you down just knowing that you take them seriously will mean something.</TEXT>
