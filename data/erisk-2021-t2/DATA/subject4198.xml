    <TEXT>I suppose there are two ways to look at this. First, if something happens that drives people to a particular religion en masse, that would be potentially be very consequential. And the converse is also true - knowledge of some thing or event that drove people from a particular religion. But at this point, to true believers, what could such a thing be that would make them stop believing? And what could happen that was so convincing it made people drop their existing religion, or take one up if they are atheist? Another way to look at it is to think about how people would act if there was some conclusive proof, either way, that there is or isn't life after death, or conclusive proof that there is or isn't reincarnation. It would seem to me to be highly consequential if people believed there was actual benefit or cost to their actions during their life time. But ultimately I'm not sure if knowledge of this fact would change things too much for people e.g. Is everyone going to just act out of self-interest, more than they do now? It's an interesting line of thought and clearly consequential. Originally my thinking of more physical "facts" such as, a way/method that anyone could generate their own energy without dependency on anyone else (without having to buy a lot of expensive equipment). or maybe a historical truth or mistruth, such as what if we found evidence of earlier failed colonies where the east had landed in the west, or proof that actual "agreements" do exist to keep certain power groups and structures in their place in the world, at the expense of others.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Insurance is a sad, ugly game. Sad cause you are taking advantage of a clear information mismatch; ugly cause you are fucking with real people's lives for profit. Insurance policies are hard to wade through as a lawyer; lots of case law and you need to understand the legal meaning (as in the meaning a court would ascribe to a word) of seemingly related terms like "flood," "storm," "water damage," "storm surge" etc. There is also a lot of technical evidence that would be involved, including what the actual cause of the water entering your dwelling was, which may or may not be what the laymen would say it was, combined with complicated rules about when water has or hasn't broken a river-bank, evidence of different water sources etc. I had an issue understanding the insurance coverage of a client and took the policy wording to our insurance litigation partner eg the guy who takes multi-billion lawsuits to court. He had a wry smile when I said that it seemed weird to me so many fundamental words were either not defined or poorly chosen. "That's the whole point," he said. "Completely ambiguous so neither you nor the insurer can say exactly what it does or doesn't cover." So you end up having to wait forever for your money, or the cost and stress of going to court. They know straight up a huge number of people will take their "you are not uninsured at face value" and walk away without question - so this is worth it for them alone. Even if you are right, you will need a lot of patience and 3+ years (assuming it settles - longer if not) to make it wind through the courts and in that times, these pricks will be making money on your money so every extra day you wait, they win. How cynical is it really? I once had car insurance policy. Drove through "flood waters" and inside of car was all drenched. I booked in insurance inspection. I had high excess cause that made most sense financially. Deal was that if assessment was less than my excess, they wouldn't do anything and I'd fix it myself. Never got call back and they just did the work. When I complained, got the usual bullshit (eg "we had your consent") till kept pushing (e.g. "Show me in the agreement where it says you can proceed without my authorization") and spoke to their lawyer. He basically acknowledged to me on the phone that they wrote their consumer agreements informally eg no legalese, no hard contract terms, almost like a feel-good sales document, because they know in practice no one really calls "bullshit" on them and asks to see what the actual contract says, and this makes them seem more approachable. That is, your insurance contract is a marketing tool, not a legal document assigning risk. If you're being screwed, double down. These guys are snakes and need to be exposed.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Uh ok. So they are written in "plain English", and thus are incapable of having more than one meaning and/or insurance companies are incapable of denying or minimizing your claim cause a DOI approved the policy. I don't know what all the fuss is about. I take it back: insurance companies are decent people - they are just misunderstood and anyone who doesn't "get it" is a fucking idiot.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Maybe. Depends how much pressure there is on them to move things along. In other like events there is sometimes enough collective outrage at the end that a regulator steps in and requires it to be crystal clear who is covered for which disaster - so there can be no lines balls under the policy. Other issue is that maybe a lot of insurers will decline to offer flood insurance for certain affected areas if they realize how easily a bad flood can occur. Insurance companies don't lose "bigly" very often</TEXT>

    <TEXT>What you are talking about is true to a degree - that is, many people whose education or experience would make them good jurors, are for a number of reasons not sitting in them. If you go back to a key purpose of a jury, it is supposed to be a trial "of your peers" - which is often a fallacy in practice but the idea is that a range of similar and "normal" people "like the accused" are there to weigh the evidence - rather than just one person, or some elite group. Pros: more likely to be "objective." Higher chance they will be able to understand and process legal concepts and technical evidence. Greater chance that they will be driven by the admissible evidence, rather than biases and impressions. Cons: not really a "jury of your peers" eg you are no longer being tried by a cross-section of society. Open to criticism that it is elite, has its own cultural bias, or is not that different from a judge only trial.</TEXT>

Other insurers will nickel and dime stuff if they have worked out the economics are better. Biggest difference in terms of what they pay will be whether it is reinstatement or market value eg are they paying you the amount you originally bought it for, or the actual market value of it today after wear/tear and depreciation. And of course you need to be able to show you owned something in the case of theft or fire.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I think your logic is sound. But if you say the problem is ostensibly that juries tend to act irrationally, the solution is not professional juries but just judge only trials. And this happens in many cases - lower courts for example or where the defendant believes that they will not get a fair hearing, they can seek a judge only trial. Trials often become a bit of theatre and it's not for nothing that many barristers (or trial attorneys in the US) often have acting/drama backgrounds and interests. The truth of the matter is that juries are inherently unpredictable because they are made up of random people, each filled with biases, emotions and all the quirks you get from 12 unique and complicated human beings. The advertising world is built on the fact we make most decisions emotionally not rationally so join the dots on what that means for an accused.</TEXT>

It does great job (Albeit highly dramatized) of showing how people tasked with making an important decision can't really do so separate from all the things that have happened in their life before they hit the jury room</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Think there are more things dissimilar than similar with your example of a GOT actor in a rape scene. For one, this ad was supposed to be uplifting and inspiring. It can only achieve that if it was "real" and thus would resonate with people. So with a simple cut and paste they have taken an event that carries a lot of emotion for many people and made it into a whimsical ad to align certain values to their brand. very different from the goals of movies or tv show actors. Plus I don't think you get to take the pay cheque and then disown any blowback for your role in it. One big irony here is that she is actually doing the very thing most people hate on her family and their ilk for: soulless, stand for nothing, rent seeking. Hard to be famous I spose ;-)</TEXT>

    <TEXT>You never really hear of actors getting blamed for the stuff they are in - only poor acting. Maybe that's because everyone accepts acting is their profession and it means taking on sometimes average roles or you are just there to "play a part" not decide what to do or say. I actually remember there being criticism of that Sansa rape scene - at the directors though, not the actors. I suppose the other big difference with ads and celebrities is that they are very much trading off their own brand and values - otherwise they are not attractive to the company - and so if they make shitty choices about which products to market and sell, it can only be because of their poor judgment (or lack of principles). Maybe the distinction with all actors is unfair but seems to be how it works.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>One good thing of "social media" is the decentralization of information and the ability for other sources and voices to be heard. The problem is, people now seem to equate all those sources as equally valid, irrespective of the amount of work (or not) that has gone into the message. The other frustrating part is reading the comments on decent quality journalism and everyone has an opinion on the journalism (not the story). I have a fry pan, camera and some basil too - doesn't make me Jamie fucking Oliver.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Nope. Lived there 5 years and visit all the time. Something missing from this story. Either the person he touched was super sensitive and connected (unlikely), he touched him in a weird way (accidental but weird) and the person he touched had overreacted or the Scottish dude has handled it badly. Personally, I #8217;d never touch a local of either sex that I didn #8217;t know really well cause could maybe see this happening with an Arabic female but male seems really strange. There is a hierarchy there and being a Muslim, middle eastern male doesn #8217;t guarantee you anything - in many cases, you #8217;d be much better off with Western passport - unless you are local, GCC resident, or super connected.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Sorry but feels like no one on this thread has been there but is reacting to stories off the internet #8217;s Ive lived there for 5 years and worked for western company with 4000 people across the ME. Never heard of anything like this happen to anyone I know, or anyone that worked for us. Biggest risk here is offending someone important eg flipping the bird in road rage or over reacting to small issue, and offending someone. It #8217;s actually pretty rare in my view. Are there something #8217;s that are shit? Yes, for sure. Are there areas where their laws are behind ours? Yes, no question. But compared to rest of ME it #8217;s a really liberal and open place - it #8217;s not LA but is not KSA either. To write it off because of stories like this is a mistake. There are hundreds of bars and clubs in Dubai and people get up to all sorts of crazy shit - stuff you couldn #8217;t do in Western bars at times. There are some big things you don #8217;t do - like drinking on the street or touching local or Arab women (but where is that ok?) and if you have an issue with someone, you have to be polite and deescalate it. But I have no idea how this dude got himself into this situation and I would never worry about any shit like this being there - and nor do the thousands of expats who get farked up every Friday at brunch there</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Depends what interests you. I actually like camping in the desert but looking at it is kinda meh. I can see why people feel Dubai is a bit Vegas like but I enjoyed the cool new shit they do there and if wanted to see more  #8220;normal #8221; life and culture, you can go to Oman or small Emirates and have cool experience. Living there is amazing because you can travel to Asia, Africa, Europe or the rest of Middle East/Mediterranean in 4+ hrs and you have the salary to travel a lot and life comfortably. If you love being outside and mountains and forests, it #8217;s gonna suck for you but if you like super modern things and getting to see Arabic culture in a safe, liberal environment, it #8217;s really cool. I see lots of people from Europe coming to Dubai for a week every Christmas - I don #8217;t get it cause it #8217;s not cheap and there are more interesting places to lie on a beach but whatever floats your boat</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Ok so here is my thing with selfies (cause I can see people like them...) 1. I go to really cool places now and am bumping into people walking blind across an amazing bridge or buzzing street because they are trying to make sure they are in shot as they film themselves walking around. Seems like where they are is not as important as them being the center of attention for whoever is going to look at their photos or videos 2. A lot of people now seem to require a photo of a cool statue, landmark, vista etc with them in it. I get it - it #8217;s cool to have reminder or strike a Vogue in front of something special to you, but it feels more and more like people have this need to be in photos of such places. It #8217;s a personal thing I guess but I could take 60gb of photos on a trip in a week and maybe you will see me or whoever I am with a handful of times. I can #8217;t help but think there is the strange disconnect where people who are in each shot thinks  #8220;the memory #8221; has more validity if you can see them in a photo 3. This particular set up from the OP feels like part of the Kim K/Instagram world we are in - watch the endless posing as he moves the camera around - and I don #8217;t see this lil trend taking us to a good place. But yeah, live and let live and whatever floats your boat. TL:DR If people like it cool; if people are doing it to be cool, I feel a bit sorry for them</TEXT>

    <TITLE>Advice on setting up offshore entity</TITLE>
    <DATE>2017-10-14 16:24:06</DATE>
    <TEXT>Heya, I #8217;m looking to create a holding company as a place to park various online businesses. Have no idea right now what kind of revenue I would be looking at (have hopes but realistic have to assume will be minimal). Would like to create offshore company in a jurisdiction with no tax, ability to open local bank account, and minimal upfront and ongoing costs until I work out what makes sense for tax and structuring going forward. Currently am UAE resident for tax purposes. Was initially looking at Seychelles due to relative low cost, and seemingly reliable legal system but seems like BVI is safer bet, more reliable and has better legal system (although higher costs). Really looking to hear from people who have done this themselves, what they found worked and what makes sense when you are unsure on immediate cash flow.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I agree you should go there, even if it just to one country (better if you can do one country in at least north, west, east, and south to see the similarities and differences). Spend time in a city but also spend time on the road and you will pick up what drives specific parts of the economy, where the investment is needed, and what people are spending their money on, and also who is already doing business there and making money. I was in Ghana and Burkina Faso a few months ago and i spent a lot of time trying to work out what kind of companies would do well there, noting relative low disposal income, high cost of capital and endless commercial, ethical and sovereign risks. For sure there is big money to be made there but you would have to really know the market and I don #8217;t think it is something you can understand without seeing it and experiencing it first hand. If you want ideas for safe places to travel but still see booming places, pm me</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Curious to know where you have seen people in the UAE being spat on and beaten? Flipping the bird to someone here is a criminal offense. I have been to many construction sites throughout the Middle East and can say I have never heard of or been made aware anyone being beaten on a construction site and people who have been here 20 yrs say the same thing. If I saw it, I would report it immediately as it is totally unacceptable and I doubt any rational person here would say otherwise. When you saw this conduct occurring, what did you do about it? Who did you report it to? When someone dies here on site, the site supervisor, and health and safety lead are almost immediately put into jail until an investigation is complete. People routinely go to Jail for their actions or inactions on construction sites here - whether they were directly implicated or in a support/supervision role. Not sure if you can claim there are no repercussions or what this is based on. When you say people are being  #8220;coaxed into traveling here #8221; where did you think this occurs (seeing as they don #8217;t have internet etc...)? And who is exploiting them? Guarantee such exploitation is not from Emiratis - they do not source the labor from the home countries of these people, and nor are they working on these projects in a construction capacity. The exploitation by and large happens in their home countries, by their own fellow nationals. Let #8217;s not blame the UAE for the actions of other people. And let #8217;s not hold them to the same standard the West is at now; they are a newly developed country; I bet we would be embarrassed about many of the labor practices that happened at the same point of our own countries, heaven forbid we went back to when we were actually using real slave labor to generate or wealth. If you feel so strongly against  #8220;slave labor #8221; I assume this means you are very careful about where you buy your smartphone, trainers, all your clothes, all your pens and plastic cups etc etc from, because you would know and understand the conditions in which these products are produced, in countries all around the world. You would also know that no matter how imperfect the UAE might be, it is miles ahead of the treatment of the vast majority of these workers in their home country, again, at the hands of their fellow nationals and governments. You would presumably also be concerned to make sure your conclusions were based in actual facts and evidence, less is seem like you were holding the UAE to a standard you would not hold other like nations to, or perhaps, even hold yourself to in your own actions</TEXT>

    <TEXT>What passport are you traveling on? Where are you flying from and to? There are lots of ways to work around shit like this (I #8217;ve made all sorts of mistakes) and almost all of them are fixable. For starters, unless your uncle has booked all the resorts etc through third party service providers, most of it will be refundable (at least in part ) OR most places will allow you to move the booking as long as they have 24hrs notice plus (because they can resell it and still make money). I have done this a million times and if you are persistent, you can almost always work something out. There are lots of flight options. Maybe you fly to a neighboring country and cross the border by land - they can be a lot more  #8220;forgiving #8221; at land border crossings (for better or for worse). Wait till you can change the flights or try and find cheaper flights. Give us your start and end destinations and I bet there are cheaper options that $12K (no names or passports or whatever just locations). Honestly, it isn #8217;t going to be bad as it seems having made every kind of mistake possible I know. You will get there. Frustrating and shit now but it #8217;s not going to be $30K wasted and if you honestly think it is, let me know - I #8217;ll go into bat for you and hustle the shit out of people until you get a fair deal.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I was 18; my brother took me to a casino to see a band for my birthday. Cocktails and casinos made me giddy and I had already smashed some of the girliest looking cocktails you could find. I was playing a $5 blackjack table trying to be all James Bond and I can #8217;t remember who noticed it first but a few tables over there was some people at another $5 table playing behind a fancy velvet rope. We worked out it was Robin Williams - think he was there for Jumanji with I assume his wife and two friends. They were all playing kinsa serious but he was dabbling and mainly mucking around, not too involved. Being young, cocky and boozed up I move right next to the rope and am pretty much standing behind him while everyone else just stares at him. I #8217;m trying my best to be hella cool and chat - try and get some jokes in - but not be a dick - all in circumstance where I am almost certainly going to be a dick. I don #8217;t remember what we talked about - mainly like the stupidity of trying to make money in a casino but he was super nice, super kind and never gave the impression that I was annoying the shit out of him - which seems really unlikely - maybe he was just a happy tolerant guy. I think he gave a half snigger at a few of my shitty jokes too and though I #8217;m sure he was indulging me, it was pretty neat. I remember thinking he was reallly short, had super hairy arms like an ape and that it was weird he was playing cheap tables with the plebs when he could #8217;ve been in some balla area and away from idiots like me. I was super high after and couldn #8217;t believe I had a neat little single serve interaction with basically my comedic idol. I have no idea who he really was - but I read stuff when he died about how he always wanted people to feel good because he often didn #8217;t and it reminded me of his kindness to me that night</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I #8217;m sorry to hear this. I live in the region and have been to Saudi a few times. I #8217;m not sure if any of this helps but this is what I would try 1. Make peace with your family. You need their trust to achieve anything 2. You either need to get another passport or access to someone who can help you get out of the country as a long term goal. 3. Are you in Riyadh? Most of the embassies are there and I think a good course of action would be to try and meet people who work at the Embassies, especially French or Scandinavian. For sure they would have dealt with issues Luke #8217;s this before. They might be able to advise you of the best way to do this and you might also form some good friendships. The consular scene in Riyadh is very much alive you just need to find an invite to one of the National celebration days or functions and go from there. 4. Do you have any male relatives who would be sympathetic to you and would not betray you? No matter how far removed from you - as you know the right person with the right connection can fix anything there. What about R? You need to try and find someone who can take on your family and force them to back down 5. Not sure where you live but I would try and get to al Khobar and  #8220;visit #8221; Bahrain for a weekend - leave Thursday afternoon around 3pm as it will not be a big deal at that time - and take a flight from there. Of course, you need to somehow get your passport back - unless they will let you travel to another GCC country eg Bahrain on your residence ID and then from Bahrain you try and get a new passport? Good luck. Be patient. And use the internet to connect with people who have already managed to do this and indicated above</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Stop seeing yourself and people like you as the center of the universe and getting absorbed in the false  #8220;problems #8221; that go along with that. Probably you have actually got a pretty awesome life in the scheme of things and don #8217;t have to deal with any of the awful stuff that affects the vast majority of the world: civil war; endemic mind numbing corruption and waste of limited public resources; little to no chance of meaningful economic change; little to no chance of political empowerment or freedom of expression. And then recognizing this, start to see what you can do to unpick some of these gross injustices in some small way. Even if all you ever do is take the time to see how lucky you are, how many opportunities you really have, and to make the most of your hand in life - this is a small way to realise that actually, your life is pretty good and you can afford to be a little less self-absorbed, and a little more empathetic for the life of others. And, it actually feels good too - one the quickest paths out of sadness and depression comes from switching your concern to others. Peace</TEXT>

So, if the average person could easily see you, or you were clearly reckless or indifferent to whether or not people could see you, I suspect the court would err against you. Conversely, if the only way a member of the public could be offended by your conduct was to themselves undertake potentially offensive conduct eg using binoculars to spy on you, I think you would probably be ok.

What is minimum most likely time I #8217;ll need to get through immigration at 2pm on a weekday? 2. If I have carry on and check in online, is there a way to go straight from international to my domestic flight or do I need to exit the departure side, and then go through security again as a domestic passenger?

    <TITLE>Advice on a kit to travel anywhere, anytime with 3 yr old</TITLE>
    <DATE>2018-06-15 17:43:45</DATE>
    <TEXT>Hi Sorry this is kinda long My wife, 3 yr old and I are planning to quit our jobs (well, he doesn #8217;t have one to quit...) and mainly live/travel (and work a little bit eventually) for a couple of years. Mosquito Coast was my favorite movie as a kid and this will be my very sanitized version of living simply. Most of the places we have in mind will be cheaper, developing countries or fairly remote (eg Colombia, Philippines, Panama, St Lucia, Balkans, Guatemala, Solomon Island) so we can live fairly simply, independently and not burn cash too fast. I #8217;d like to have a light and compact kit that basically means wherever we go, whatever happens, we are going to be able to deal with any problems or emergencies and can also live independently eg can camp or live in simple huts if that #8217;s what makes sense for where we are, or if the accommodation we have isn #8217;t great or fails we can manage. In my head, the basic things we need to deal with are: 1. Being able to sterilize water and store say 48 hrs at all times: I was going to buy a sawyer 1 fallow gravity but someone bought me an MSR mini works for Xmas which seems fine. I have a couple of camelback type bladders and this filter screws straight into them. It takes around 10 mins to pump 3 liters of water with this rig. We will also have water sterilization tablets/drops as backup. 2. Having some way to heat water and cook basic meals (and then very light and simple kit to eat meals with): I #8217;m interested in idea of Biolite stove but get the feeling it might be a bit gimmicky, too big and I #8217;ve heard it #8217;s not really practical for charging a device. I #8217;ve obviously used simple hiking stoves before but wonder if they would be a bit too basic for what we might need it for and also can #8217;t depend on always have access to fuel cubes or branded gas cylinders. Is there something in between really basic hiking stove and maybe more of a camping stove - interested in brand recommendations and obviously the lighter and more compact the better, noting we need it to be workable for potentially daily or long term use. Also any recommendations for chow kits or fold up pot/pan appreciated 3. Some source of power - ideally that can run 240v stuff eg charge a laptop. My research suggests that solar panel rigs are maybe not efficient enough to justify and the battery packs eg GoalZero Yeti 150 etc I #8217;ve seen look cool but the weight is a problem. Is there a happy medium? I #8217;ve got Anker packs for phones etc but they won #8217;t do for anything that requires 240v 4. Source of light - we have Petzl head lamps, small maglite and a Biolite torch that can work as a lamp and also back up charger (I think you can add small lights to it as well). Anyone had any good experience with any hand cranking lights or anything else that would be good, simple addition? 5. Source of communication - probably a satellite phone. I understand main choice is between Irridum and Inmarsat. Based on what I #8217;ve read, my preference is to get an Iridium 9555 with a 1 yr prepaid card if say 100 hours- i know it #8217;s expensive but I like the idea of being able to send sms and also the gps pinging function makes sense to me. Does anyone have experience with either kind and a strong view with way? Does anyone recommend or have a good experience with a hand crank radio? 6. Good first aid kit - hopefully we have one that works we will supplement it with medication for malaria etc depending on where we are. We will have a lot of bug spray (deet) and sunscreen. I guess we should take a mosquito net and permethrin soak everything before we go too. We will always try to be 2 hrs or so within decent medical clinic with a 3 yr old but this won #8217;t always be possible of course 7. Say 48hrs of emergency calories for everyone: we will always have other food but am thinking if we keep a stash of say 48 hrs of RTE meals, energy bars and a lot of trail mix, this should hopefully be a sufficient but light stash (cause every little cm and gram will count) eg we will be hauling this onto flights too 8. Other basic camping/hiking gear to start a fire, build a shelter, fish, signal: I think (hope) have this covered. We have water proof matches, flint and lighters, emergency tinder and vaseline; signal mirror and whistle; emergency foil blankets plus larger plastic sleeping sack that can double as shelter; leatherman, schrade schf9 extreme for grunt work and a fallkniven folding for finer work;we will all have water proof jacket, pants, shoes and 1 replacement, plus dry sacks for clothes and electrical stuff. Will probably carry at least one super compact and hardcore sleeping bag. I #8217;ll carry simple fishing kit and lures but happy for recommendations for this or anything else above. I have a Montana Garmin gps plus hikers compass. 9. Any other super neat, useful and hiker friendly kit that you love or think would be a great addition...? I #8217;d love coffee options as my guilty non-essential item but haven #8217;t found good brand. I #8217;m 50-50 on whether or not it #8217;s worth carrying a tent with us or we pick one up as and when we need it. But if there is a super compact product that would work for us I #8217;d been keen to check it out 10. Obvious shit I #8217;ve missed...? Ive posted this at r/preppers too cause they will have a useful and different take. Thanks everyone</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Hi thanks for your comments. I #8217;ve travelled to all of these places myself or very similar and have a pretty good idea of what we are in for. To be honest, most of the places we are thinking about living in are not really that sketchy from my perspective which is why they make the list eg any where with serious security issues or unmanageable health risks is out. None of them places we are going are anything like India from a health risk perspective or Ghana/Brazil from a security perspective. Having said that, we will still have to work out where the nearest medical center is, what it can and can #8217;t do and if it doesn #8217;t make sense with a 3 yr old, we won #8217;t go. I #8217;ve got lots of friends who have lived in or raised kids in some of these places or similar. I #8217;m super anal when it comes to mosquito borne illnesses but nothing is fool proof. We like a bit of risk but we are not idiots. We have travelled to developing places with him but only after doing our homework. In terms of visas etc , again we will do our homework but most of the places I am thinking of we are eligible for a visa on arrival and the only address I #8217;ve ever been asked to stick on a visa form was the first hotel I was staying in and never had any issues any place I have been.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Thanks for your detailed responses I really appreciate it. Language: Spanish pretty good, basic Portuguese and french. I #8217;ve been to enough places to know that you can always get buy without it (am in Azerbaijan now and we are managing). The one exception is a medical emergency - have had an experience like this with an ex in Vietnam and we managed. These days with Apps and translators etc am hoping we can sort it much easier than I did back then. My credit card provides an emergency health service which won #8217;t actually fix anyone but can tell us where to go or give over the phone assistance. In the end, we will always want to be reasonably close to a decent medical facility Solar panels: do you have experience with a system that works and is reliable? I #8217;ve used Anker products and like them but am also interested in goal zero (although I note your comment below about the yeti) Lights and batteries: yeah this makes sense. Thanks will checkout r/flashlight Comms: Again, I #8217;ve had too many experiences where there should be cell Coverage and there is not. We do a fair bit of hiking and boating so it would definitely get used at some point and this would just make me feel more comfortable knowing I can always talk to someone, especially if we need emergency medical help. Radio: ok thanks. I #8217;ll take your advice. Do you have brand you recommend for simple radio? Camping, sleeping bag etc: like you say, most of the places we are going to are specifically warm places (wife hates cold). My logic is I would carry all the kit I would have for multi day hikes (because for sure we will do long hikes - maybe not multi day) and other things to get me out of a tight spot. I guess we might need to take full sleeping bags for everyone but it #8217;s a lot of space when I #8217;m not sure how much use they would get. Do you have any sleeping pad recommendations - obviously size is very important. Thanks again</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Thanks i really appreciate your thoughtful response. You #8217;ve hit on the basic conflict I have between less and making sure I #8217;m not caught short in some situation just to save a few grams. My wife always thinks we don #8217;t need the SHTF stuff but it always makes me feel better and most of it is very light. Also things like fishing kit is because I #8217;d like to teach our son some basic things too. I #8217;ve always carried the multi tool everywhere so that would be my primary knife if I ditched others. I don #8217;t think I #8217;ve quite worked out whether we are going to carry a full tent and sleeping gear or Not eg is it worth it relative to the amount of times we will definitely use it. Probably in the end it will be. We will have two large backpacks and then a smaller day pack (which we can also carry our son in) we would use for for hiking (so ditch the larger bags somewhere and carry what we need for day/overnight trips. But I will do as you say and set it all out and weigh it and see what justifies itself. Thanks again</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I #8217;ve travelled a fair bit through Central Asia and the Middle East (and parts of North Africa) and am always interested to see the different styles of carpets. Two things that always seem common though are (1) that they appear to be a highly sought after item (and I #8217;m never sure if this is due for functional or status/cultural reasons) and (2) it also seems like carpets/rugs are seen as a good method of storing wealth, I assume because they are always tradeable/sellable and in many cases increase in value in time. I am interested to understand how this developed and whether it was coordinated eg through Ottoman influence or arose more organically in different places.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Yeah the quality of the materials and level of effort. The first thing I do now is turn a rug over and count the knots. The second thing I do is try and work out the amount of silk in it. The third thing is the age. Buying rugs is hard: you are always a severe information gap from the seller. You need to see lots of examples and prices to start to recognize the quality and the price points. Best if you are at the source and then you can really compare like for like and also know you are not paying 2,3,4,5x different lots of Mark-ups on the rug</TEXT>

    <TEXT>We might be at cross purposes here. I understand the point you are making. It makes perfect sense. (The answer to your question is actually both for the record). What you say does explain why for example there are more beautiful old rugs left than ugly ones; it doesn #8217;t in my mind view explain why there was a conscious push to make rugs more complex and expensive over time. I #8217;m sure back in the day there were both cheap IKEA rugs and balla luxury rugs, both for different markets and for different purposes, as there are today. I have looked at and bought both kinds myself. So yes you are right that ugly/cheap rugs would burn out quicker and there are less of them but the part I #8217;m trying to get my head around is why did everyone collectively agree that rugs, in these communities, would become such a central part of the culture. I think lots of people in here have suggested good reasons for this too.</TEXT>

You will see the price range over a time period. Then substitute in alternative airports (3) use Kayak with the  #8220;nearby airports #8221; feature and plus or minus 3 days with your dates Cheapest ticket is going to be indirect so if you are happy to take a bit of a detour/longer to get home, this will give you best price.

    <TITLE>Best place to incorporate for start-up with easy ability to get bank account</TITLE>
    <DATE>2018-08-07 14:15:41</DATE>
    <TEXT>I #8217;m sure this gets asked a lot so happy for link to old post. I #8217;ve got a pretty good handle on options for incorporation and costs of doing so (set up and ongoing). Thing I am less clear on is whether or not I #8217;m going to actually be able to get a bank account for this entity if it #8217;s incorporated in say the Seychelles or BVI. It #8217;s well and good to have cheap fees but if I can #8217;t actually find anyone who will open me a bank account as a minor startup in these places, it #8217;s a bit pointless. Is there a country that has good legal rights, low set up and ongoing costs, low tax but where I can also easily get a bank account sorted? Thanks</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Thanks appreciate the advice. I #8217;m happy to pay tax if and when I #8217;m a resident in a taxing country; right now I #8217;m not but that might change. I #8217;ll happily pay tax if it means I #8217;ve got a business that I can protect when the time comes and it allows me to transact internationally (frankly having to pay tax is a good problem to have for a start-up...). I know a bit about AML laws so hopefully I can find a place to incorporate where I can get a bank that is recognized and yeah if this means I #8217;m paying someone to help so be it. Cheers</TEXT>

    <TEXT>If you have the wrong metric, you will always feel like a failure. Or if you are using other people #8217;s measuring sticks, you will almost always fall short. The answer is in the second part of your own question. What makes your proud? Chase that. Usually what makes you proud is living a life according to your values; maximizing your opportunities. Taking the road mixed with headaches but which gets you to the higher ground, rather than the easy path that doesn #8217;t stretch you, and so you don #8217;t grow. I guarantee whatever you think is important at 23 won #8217;t be important at 27 or 36. And whatever short term prism you see your life through will look trite and funny a few years from now. Being good at uni, or whatever other simple and  #8220;universally accepted #8221; indicator of success you pick is never going to make you happy or proud. What will make you proud is living a life true to your values - whatever the fuck they are - and asking more of yourself than you have on any given day, even if you get it wrong 6 days out of 7. You are not a failure. You are running someone else #8217;s race. Run your own. You can never fail at doing what you love and what brings you joy. I have degrees. They mean fuck all to me. I have a good job and nice title. It means fuck all to me. What matters to me is engaging with people on a real level and experiencing pure life. But that is my race. Find yours. You cannot fail at your own race. Peace</TEXT>

    <TITLE>Quickest way to do Cougar hunting challenge (over in under 30 mins)</TITLE>
    <DATE>2019-02-14 09:00:56</DATE>
    <TEXT>You #8217;ll hate yourself when you work out how easy this is. I spent hours trying to find a single cougar... Get to Beechers Hope early morning. Ride out the back as though you are heading to New Austin. Stay on the road. Have your bow out with poison arrows. There is a big bunch of trees and bushes kind of overhung with some rocks - almost the first thing along the road. That is a Cougar den. Found a couple of perfectly killed badgers in there and other bits from time to time. Ride through on your horse and brush against all the bushes. If it doesn #8217;t come out ride up to next bunch of trees/rocks on same side of road - bump and grind the trees like it #8217;s 3am at your local meat market. Just keep riding through the bushes and go back and forth between locations on that side of road. it will come out for sure. Big error I made: hit them with arrow but they didn #8217;t die and then killed them with knife. You will get skin but not kill - you must kill them with the arrow. Make sure your dead eye is fully loaded and fresh. As soon as you see the red dot either jump off or try to aim. You only need one poison arrow and it will ran away and you can catch it. If you get a head strike you will kill it. People say not to be on horse but worked for me and much quicker to move around. Skin it. Pick up the body (which from the right angle looks freakishly like a human body on your horse) than drop the cougar Body on the other side of Beechers Hope eg on the Blackwater side of the ranch fence. Sleep till morning. Repeat. I don #8217;t know 100% if you need to ditch body but I did anyway. I think once or twice I saved, loaded when it didn #8217;t come and it works as long as it #8217;s morning. Maybe it works at others times but I just did what worked Actually got a message saying I was sleeping to much from racing time ahead but did the whole thing in 30 mins.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>It #8217;s kind of obvious but every human being is so complicated there is no simple answer. I can tell you I have been in a similar situation and was told over and over by my SO that she was done and nothing would work. We tried counseling but she didn #8217;t like it. I decided for my part I wasn #8217;t done and I wanted to try everything to make it work. Somehow, we did but it #8217;s still a work in progress. There are probably lots of factors that has got your partner to this point. A couple of really big things for her are likely to be: (a) does she sincerely believe you have learned anything and can change; (b) are there strong factors you do or don #8217;t know about pushing or pulling her out of the relationship - you need to try and understand these either way and (c) does she want to try and work through this - and do you? You might have a totally fixable relationship but one or both of you don #8217;t have the strength or patience to see this out. If I had a friend describe to me the situation I was in, I #8217;d tell them it #8217;s over and they should move on. Objectively lots of the signs were very bad. And many of my friends did tell me this. That #8217;s why asking other people can be good for getting ideas but doing so is a bad measure of what will happen in your actual relationship. In the end, it comes down to your individual and collective desire to fix it. Work on you. Get happy. Actually think about her criticisms and work on them - not because you are going to change her mind but because it is the right thing for you to do in the long term, whatever happens. Respect her space and recognize she is hurting and won #8217;t get through this if she has to carry you as well as her own feelings. Prepare for a life outside the relationship and be comfortable with it - if it happens, you are prepared and if it doesn #8217;t you will have found a way to find things in your life that have meaning to you, again a good long term outcome for you. Don #8217;t blame yourself or her. Relationships are hard. Most fail. If yours fails, it #8217;s a reminder of how normal you are, not that you (or her) is flawed in some way. And if it doesn #8217;t fail, think about that every time you go to slip into your old habits and take life for granted. Good luck</TEXT>

I know she didn #8217;t get the accidental damaged add on and this wouldn #8217;t be covered by warranty but was still shocked when they told me the repair costs would be $433.

    <DATE>2020-02-01 23:50:43</DATE>
    <TEXT>Yesterday I was flicking between books, ebooks, articles and video games. I #8217;d be interested in each one for around 5-10 minutes then move to the next. I probably have around 15 books I #8217;ve half read at any moment in time. I can #8217;t even go to away for a weekend to  #8220;relax #8221; without taking 2-3 books and 2-3 hobbies because I don #8217;t know which one I #8217;ll actually feel like doing/reading.. I #8217;m the same with jobs or tasks - I always have like 5-10 projects on the go and never finish any of them or get good at any hobby because I am never committed to it for long enough. When it comes to projects that matter, the closer I get to finishing something the harder it is to complete things. I have had good jobs and am fine there because there is a gun to my head to complete things but in my personal like I feel like a complete flake and it is eating away at my confidence and self-esteem.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Thanks for this. I can imagine the historiography and narratives arecontentious. I have been watching some documentaries and the explanations why no one had fully known/done anything were a little hard to swallow. I appreciate the detail you have provided. My guess is that this is one of those inconvenient truths that no one really wanted to grapple with fully at the time and in the overall struggle of the conflict there are enough  #8220;reasonable #8221; reasons why not more was done that people are happy to let it slide. But it seems weird to me that when Allied intelligence was applied to so many aspects of the war, it couldn #8217;t have been applied to resolve this issue conclusively as it would have seemed an easier issue to resolve than many other issues that intelligence was applied to. There is no way to verify this but it would be interesting to know whether there was some resolve but no means to achieve it, or it was deemed to be just not as much as a priority at at the time due to genuine military concerns.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>From the article:  #8220;The past few weeks have been tough for Gerrity #8217;s Supermarket, a small family-owned chain in northeastern Pennsylvania. Like grocers nationwide, they #8217;ve been deluged with orders, and struggled to keep basics like chicken breasts and toilet paper on the shelves. Employees have been working overtime, pausing only for five-second breaks to wipe everything down with disinfectant wipes. Then, on Wednesday afternoon, a woman came in and deliberately coughed all over the produce section, meat case and bakery department, co-owner Joe Fasula said. The store had to throw away more than $35,000 worth of food.  #8220;Today was a very challenging day, #8221; Fasula wrote in a message to shoppers on Facebook.  #8220;While there is little doubt this woman was doing it as a very twisted prank, we will not take any chances with the health and well-being of our customers."</TEXT>

    <TEXT>They are playing you for fool. Simple as that. If you take it, they will assume you don #8217;t know any better, don #8217;t care or are desperate. You should try and establish the exact market rate for your role in that city - maybe call a recruiter and you should be able to sort it out. Either the salary has in fact dropped due to market conditions and you need to push back, or they are just trying it on. If in fact the market has dropped, you should consider how to push back tactfully but forcefully. You need to have a number if your head that you will accept and you push for that. The number has to be real eg if you don #8217;t get it, you won #8217;t take the job and vice versa. Good luck</TEXT>

    <TEXT>What is the upshot: that because companies will revert to more simplistic supply chains, based upon their home market, that profit margins will shrink? The converse might also be true: companies with greater resilience in their supply chains will be less immune to headaches like Covid 19 or US-Sino rumblings, and therefore more appealing to the market (surely the logic of the relevant companies to start with). I feel like there is a bigger implication from Dalio #8217;s comment that the article doesn #8217;t pick up and/or I don #8217;t get.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Hey I really appreciate all these posts and have been working my way through them. It #8217;s going to take a few reads to get my head around it properly - this is because it is kinda complicated and I #8217;m a bit dense - but you have explained this so well. What id like to understand is how do I take what you have written and make it practically and use it so it goes from theory to something I can actually understand at a practical level. The obvious answer is to start trading but I feel like I would like to do that ina measured way, with small amounts, so I can actually see what happens. I know there are some tools that will calculate trade outcomes for you and you can paper trade on think or swim but is there some advice you can give about how to use these guides for options trading when you are really at the beginning and want to ease into it in a way that will be sustainable. I really appreciate the effort you put into these guides thanks to much. You should consider a YouTube channel On same</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Also the location. I #8217;ve stayed in a hotel just behind here. The nearest suburb is Gemmayzeh, a fun hipster neighborhood. A motorway separates the suburb from the Port. Most of the people directly impacted would have had to be directly in or around the port. I am sure lots of people have been injured from shrapnel etc around the area but in the scheme of things, this area wouldn #8217;t be densely populated relative to the city or suburbs</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Not to be rude but do you have any idea of How the government works there? It is a complicated mix of compromises designed to loosely reflect the religious make-up of the country - basically forced positions of power to try to maintain peace. The leaders tend to come from an elite class who bear small resemblance to the majority of people. Lebanon is constantly drawn into the regional conflicts and is used as a proxy by many parties in the region because it is small, financial weak and easy to push around. The economy has been in free fall for months because the country is rife with corruption and dependent on handouts from the aforementioned countries, who withdraw it when they don #8217;t like something Lebanon does. The people have been protesting about these issues forever. It is not a case of a failure of the people to  #8220;demand accountability. #8221; It is a case of a state where the political leadership has failed the people for decades and solving those problems is very difficult, even with the best of intentions. Lebanese people are wonderful. Kind. Fun. Warm. I have felt as safe there as any other country I have been to. I don #8217;t think they need to be told, at this point in time, this was somehow caused because the people failed to do something. BTW: Even in so called well run democracies, how often does  #8220;demanding accountability #8221; actually work?</TEXT>

    <TEXT>If the short-medium future of GME is based on console sales, why don #8217;t people buy them from Walmart or amazon. Why would people buy them from GME? Seems to me it #8217;s relevant to consider/compare changes to where people buy consoles in the same time frames, no?</TEXT>

    <TITLE>NOKIA awarded contract to build cell tower on the moon</TITLE>
    <DATE>2020-10-19 09:46:30</DATE>
    <TEXT>ON THE FUCKING MOON! Who asked for it? Fuck knows. Who can use it? Like 3 Russian dudes in space trying to Omegle strip poker with your mother. What #8217;s the contract worth? About $26 and bragging rights. Sure, they have gone backwards for 18 yrs and were cool when phones weighed 4lb and lasted 12 mins call time. But who else do you know building a 4G (that #8217;s no a typo - 5G is for pussy #8217;s) cell tower on the goddam motherfucking snakes on the mother fucking plane moon?  #128013;  #127773; Exactly. When y #8217;all finally arrive on the moon with your GME, NIO and Tankergang tendies, who do you think you are going to have to pay to call your wife #8217;s boyfriend because your forgot to close out your HTZ options? NOK! This shit pays you for paying yourself, every time, 65% of the time. You are actually losing money reading this horseshit. Can I get an AMEN up in this beeee-aaaa-tccchhhh? To valhalla and beyond!!!  #128640; Positions: NOK C 6 4/16</TEXT>

    <TITLE>What stocks will do well depending on who is elected to the White House?</TITLE>
    <DATE>2020-10-19 10:36:33</DATE>
    <TEXT>Obviously ignore the actual politics of it. Seems to me that if Biden is elected the following would do well - Green energy - due to positive legislation and/or incentives - cannabis company #8217;s - Harris has indicated they will legalize - Chinese company #8217;s - believe BABA, NIO and others will increase because Trump currently has ongoing trade war with China. Do others think Biden will continue or reverse this course? For Trump - Energy stocks - he favors deregulation and often hypes carbon fuels industry so assume they will recover? - Big banks - again deregulation - Airlines and defense esp Boeing - likely to do well from stimulus plans and they seem like industries important to his base Any others? Any you would remove?</TEXT>
