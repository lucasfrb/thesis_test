    <TITLE>Cryptocurrency Research Report  #8212; Aave</TITLE>
    <DATE>2020-03-31 08:15:08</DATE>
    <TEXT>**Author #65306;CoinEx Global Ambassador NeoBeum** **Project Overview** Aave is a Finnish word that translates to  #8216;Ghost #8217; in English. The foundations for Aave is to be transparent and create an open and non-custodial platform for decentralized finance that uses  #8216;aToken #8217; to peg a 1 to 1 ratio for the underlying asset. The project is headquartered in London, England, and lists 18 individuals from various backgrounds as the core team responsible for Aave. The Aave project #8217;s main site hosted at [https://aave.com](https://aave.com/) and the protocol is open source with repositories available at [https://github.com/aave.](https://github.com/aave.) The Aave platform is built on the Ethereum network and currently offers lending solutions for 16 cryptocurrencies, 6 of which are the stable coins: DAI (DAI), USDC (USDC), TrueUSD (TUSD), Tether (USDT), Synthetix USD (SUSD) and Binance USD (BUSD), with the remaining of the lending pool comprised of Ethereum (ETH), ETHLend (LEND), Basic Attention Token (BAT), Kyber Network (KNC), ChainLink (Link), Decentraland (MANA), Maker (MKR), Augur (REP), Synthetix (SNX), Weighted Bitcoin (WBTC) and 0x Coin (ZRX). Aave has its founding roots from ETHLend which was an Estonian ICO launched late 2017. In September 2018, ETHLend transitioned to Aave. **Business Model** Aave generates its revenue through interest rates bound to customers when taking contracts. Tokens available are pooled together known as the LendingPool and a Lending Pool Configurator is responsible for calculating the interest rates for the contracts issued. Collateral is backed as  #8216;aTokens #8217; when deposited to the Aave lending pool. Rates are calculated with a Lending Rate Oracle and instantaneous market value of tokens influence the overall value of these variables, and rates for Flash Loans. **Team Information** As ETHLend expanded, it transformed its operations and Aave was conceived. The team carries over its Estonian core members and recruited new members in London. At time of writing this short analysis, Aave is also hiring a Back End developer to join the team. **Project Roadmap** 2017 #8211;11  #8212; Initial Coin Offering 2018 #8211;09  #8212; ETHLend becomes Aave 2020 #8211;01  #8212; Launch of Aave Protocol **Governance Model** The Gonernance for Aave occurs at two levels, The Lending Pool Governance and the Protocol Governance. The lending pool is governed with aTokens and voting is weighted from the share of the pool #8217;s liquidity. The protocol is controlled by the LEND token and voting is weighted based on the share of tokens held at vote counting. **Technical** Further Technical reading and Whitepaper can be located at [https://github.com/aave/aave-protocol/blob/master/docs/Aave\_Protocol\_Whitepaper\_v1\_0.pdf](https://github.com/aave/aave-protocol/blob/master/docs/Aave_Protocol_Whitepaper_v1_0.pdf) **Community** The social networks for Aave indicates a community base of approximately 44,000 users, with estimates of 6,000 active users in telegram. **Competition** Aave is one of the smaller DeFi projects with a market cap of approximately $22,000,000 USD. Direct rivals would include Compound, Fulcrum and EOSREX on the EOS Blockchain. **Risk Evaluation** With a relatively low market cap, Aave reduces the risk by providing a non-custodial solution. However, this does not grant immunity from market fluctuations, with recent examples of the market downturn in March 2020. The nature of lending platforms expose investors to high risk of liquidation and bankruptcy when major market movements reduce overall capital and confidence in the market. Being a smaller project in comparison to competition, Aave does not provide competitive interest rates that would otherwise entice investors to their platform. *The content is for opinion sharing only and should not be relied upon to make any investment decisions.*</TEXT>

    <TITLE>CoinEx Institution: Cryptocurrency Research Report - Power Ledger</TITLE>
    <DATE>2020-04-09 05:45:50</DATE>
    <TEXT>Author #65306;CoinEx Global Ambassador Er.R.Vinothkumar **Project Overview:** Power Ledger is building a platform with the goal of creating decentralized energy markets **History:** Power ledger is building a platform where users can contribute or consumer clean energy resources across the network. Pegged to local currencies and convertible to cash, the platform aims to focus on individuals in high density and urban environments. Unlike centrally managed power systems, these decentralized energy resources are not powered by one central provider, potentially creating a more competitive environment and preventing the potential for complete system shut downs. The team believes that by building this blockchain enabled peer-to-peer energy platform, they can reinvent energy markets. They intend to have a wide menu of energy applications including ones that can give retailers or users the ability to simply trade electricity with one and another in real time. Long term, the team envisions an application that will allow for shared ownership of energy assets as well as autonomous energy agents that will automatically disperse energy that is acquired. Power Ledger operates on two blockchain layers and uses two tokens, POWR and Sparkz. The POWR token is an ERC20 token that can operate on the Ethereum network. Sparkz, on the other hand, is purchased and redeemed using fiat currencies within individual trading platforms that have closed-loop exchanges for energy and Sparkz. In the system, the POWR tokens are the protocol tokens used to access the Power Ledger platform, as well as interact with the Sparkz token directly. Sparkz tokens are stable and pegged to local currency. As the Sparkz tokens are a closed loop internal token, they can move instantly with banking overheads to allow for timely micro energy transactions. In the future, the team expects that application hosts such as property managers, utilities and retailers will demand the POWR tokens as their platforms grow and they will need the Sparkz to power the platform. **Tagline** Decentralized energy marketplace **Technology** Power Ledger uses the public Ethereum blockchain to support the POWR token as well as a private consortium blockchain for the transaction of energy within peer-to-peer trading environments using the Sparkz token. Starting at that protocol layer, the Ethereum blockchain core allows for POWR to be ERC20 in nature and provides a trustless and open source implementation of key components of POWR. Connected with layer is the Power Ledger Core that includes an industry specific consortium blockchain. Called the EcoChain, it is a low cost, in-house, Proof-of-Authority blockchain that has been live tested in multiple public trials. Its key functions include the management of the internal Sparkz token, fiat payment processor integration, storage and verification of smart contract readings and a whole suite of other possibilities that can be unlocked as the platform scales. The team plans to transition to a public proof-of-stake blockchain in the future to enable new features and the inclusion of new markets like carbon trading and peer-to-peer energy exchanges.

    <TITLE>Introduction to Cryptocurrencies: BSV, the Messenger to Realize Satoshi Vision</TITLE>
    <DATE>2020-04-10 06:20:55</DATE>
    <TEXT>*Written by the CoinEx Institution*, *this series of jocular and easy to understand articles will show you everything you need to know about major cryptocurrencies*, *making you fully prepared before jumping into crypto!*  #8203; https://preview.redd.it/y9yfo8z7oxr41.png?width=1400 amp;format=png amp;auto=webp amp;s=02a7b4e9d3733afddbb3291cdaecf869c155bdd8 Today we are going to introduce the BSV, which has just finished its first halving and the block reward has been reduced to 6.25 BSV. BSV represents  #8220;Bitcoin Satoshi Vision #8221;, aiming to achieve the original intention of a large-scale on-chain expansion and be a universal peer-to-peer electronic cash and a valuable data transmission network. You may ask, was not BTC born on behalf of Satoshi Vision? Then what was BSV made for? How can it represent Satoshi Vision and even claim itself as the  #8220;rebirth of original Bitcoin #8221; To explain this, we have to go back to BTC and BCH, two predecessors contributing to the birth of BSV #8212;**BSV is a fork of BTC #8217;s fork, which means that BSV is actually a fork of BCH.** (You may think it is crazy: What on earth are all these forks for?) We talked about BTC and BCH in previous articles of CoinEx Introduction to Cryptocurrency. BTC has been criticized for its technical design flaw of the small block capacity. When it comes to capacity expansion, many BTC believers and programmers made a lot of improvements on the original basis (for the complicated process, check our previous introductions). In addition to BCH, there are various fork coins such as BTG, up to more than 80 at the peak (which shocked me), but many of them were just a flash in the pan amid the BTC rush. Only BCH and BTG finally survived and were recognized. We will leave BTG to another article later. BCH was forked from BTC in 2017. After one year, BCH was again ushered in a fork as the two development teams of BCH failed to agree on how to best develop BCH and deploy updated codes. **As a result, BCH was split into two camps, BCH ABC and BCH SV**, and they decided to compete for championship with hashrate! As a result, at 0:40 am on November 16, 2018 started the first hashrate war in the history of digital currencies! One of the **two sides in this decisive battle was Craig Wright, who claims to be "Satoshi Nakamoto", with the nChain development team supported by Calvin Ayre, a gambling industry millionaire.Another was the Bitcoin ABC development team with its backers, Wu Jihan, Founder and CEO of Bitmain, and Roger Ver, the "Jesus of Bitcoin".** The BCH hashrate battle lasted for over one week from November 16 to November 23 when SV admitted defeat and gave up the fight over the title power. Since then, the hashrate war has officially ended, and **BCH was forked into the BCH original chain and the BSV chain, symbolizing the birth of BSV!** Bitcoin SV provides a new full-node Bitcoin Cash (BCH) that aims to realize the vision originally set by Satoshi Nakamoto in his Bitcoin white paper. Unlike other competing Bitcoin Cash (BCH) that makes unnecessary changes to Bitcoin, BSV #8216;s development roadmap aims to restore Satoshi's original agreement, maintain agreement stability, implement large-scale expansion, and then assure large companies of project development based on the solid foundation of BCH. The birth of BSV also delivered a beautiful story for its believers: **It doesn #8217;t matter that the original BTC is unable to realize Satoshi Vision, because we can fork and create BSV to continue fulfillment. Therefore, whether it is for Satoshi Vision or for commercial use worldwide, BSV represents an infinitely bright future with inestimable value.** BCH and BSV both finished halving and BTC will soon to undergo it. How will affect the market? What do you think about these? **Follow CoinEx** to get updates on the halving.

    <TITLE>Introduction to Cryptocurrencies: USDT, the most popular stable coin</TITLE>
    <DATE>2020-04-17 07:27:52</DATE>
    <TEXT>*Written by the CoinEx Institution*, *this series of jocular and easy to understand articles will show you everything you need to know about major cryptocurrencies*, *making you fully prepared before jumping into crypto!* Many novices of cryptocurrencies may feel confused with the obscure difference between USDT and USD at first . Different as they are, there remain some relations. To some extent, the name USDT is like a biased belief implanted in the minds of novices.  #8203; https://preview.redd.it/nqp97earybt41.png?width=1200 amp;format=png amp;auto=webp amp;s=84e70cc382389d21e4647b98605f3eabee06936d USDT (Tether USD), known as Tether, is a token based on the stable value currency US dollar (USD), launched by Tether. In other words, it serves as a currency to replace the US dollar in digital currency trading platforms. (With 1USDT = 1USD, users can exchange USDT for USD at a rate of 1: 1 at any time) USDT is not a new token It was launched for trading in 2015 #65292; and **the world-renowned digital asset trading service platform CoinEx supports USDT trading pairs.** There are extensive concerns about how to exchange tokens into fiat currencies after the introduction of cryptocurrency trading. USDT has provided part of the solution, and thus has been highly praised by many investors. In the white paper  #8220;*Tether: Fiat currencies on the Bitcoin blockchain #8221;*, Tether defines USDT as a digital currency pegged to fiat currencies. All Tethers are are initially issued as tokens on the BTC blockchain through the Omni Layer protocol, at a pegged exchange rate of 1:1 against the USD. After launching USDT, Tether strictly adheres to the 1:1 reserve guarantee, which means that for every issued USDT token , its bank account will have 1 USD funding guarantee. Many people are fond of USDT precisely because of its specific characteristics. In recent years, **it remains one of the most popular stablecoins**, with a market share of nearly 3 billion US dollars, leaving behind such stablecoins as USDC, Gemini Dollars and JPM Coin USDT's creator, Tether, is one of the top five digital currency companies by cash flow. They earn 3-5% profit from the $2 billion offered by the users around the world, almost without any operating costs. (This is really cool) USDT is issued and traded through the Omni (formerly known as Mastercoin) protocol, which is a 2.0 currency based on the Bitcoin blockchain. Transaction confirmation and other parameters of USDT are consistent with those of BTC. Users can transfer USD to the bank account provided by Tether through SWIFT, or get USDT through the exchange. Of course, they can also buy USDT with BTC in the exchange. In short, it is quick and easy! Unlike other digital currencies, USDT boasts some great features: **1.Intuitive** USDT is equal to the US dollar, with 1 USDT = 1 US dollar. Each currency = how much USDT, which is equal to how many US dollars its unit price is. **2.Stable** As Tether is backed by fiat currencies, users can still trade on the blockchain asset market without being affected by the price fluctuations of most blockchain assets. **3.Transparent** Tether's issuing company, Tether, claims that its fiat currency storage account has regular audits to ensure that each USDT in circulation is backed up by one US dollar. The storage account status is public and can be queried at any time. In addition, all Tether transaction records will be published on the public chain. **4. Low transaction fees** There is no fee for transactions between Tether accounts or between wallets where Tether is stored. Conversion from USDT to a fiat currency requires the transaction fee. Tether has been frank about the risks of USDT in the white paperAlthough Tether is a decentralized digital currency, Tether company is not that decentralized .. As a centralized depositor of all the assets, the company also faces possibilities of bankruptcy, freezing funds and fund running; what #8217;s more, the re-centralization may also paralyze the entire system. To put it simple: coin speculation could be risky and investors need to be cautious. Such honest companies are hard to find. Yet in March 2019, Tether changed its terms of service: the USDT's endorsement altered to 75% USD anchorage and 25% iFinex stock-collateral loans. . In April of the same year, Tether issued an additional 640 million USDT, also pushing itself to the forefront. So what #8217;s on your mind after reading this article?

    <TITLE>Risk Management in Crypto Trading</TITLE>
    <DATE>2020-06-05 02:53:55</DATE>
    <TEXT>Author: Gamals Ahmed, CoinEx Business Ambassador Financial risk management is one of the most controversial topics in trading. Traders want to reduce the risk and potential loss, but on the other hand, these traders also want at the same time to get the best profits. It is known that in order to obtain greater returns, you also need to take greater risks. Some may consider trading an entertaining and difficult pastime, but everyone should be aware that the most important aspect of trading is risk management. ## What are the different risk management techniques used in trading? **Long-term trading** Stock market traders use historical data to make long-term strategic business decisions. The long-term cryptocurrency strategy depends on current activity, and you will be more inclined towards hopeful information rather than reliable information and more suitable for cryptocurrencies. **Short term trading** Short-term traders benefit from the volatile cryptocurrency market by using swing trading when the price differs in short bursts of movement. **Technical Analysis** Technical analysis of cryptocurrencies requires research into project that affect the market based on price and volume data available through analytical technology. **Fundamental analysis** Traders often look to blogs and information sites and study the whitepaper for cryptocurrencies or cryptocurrency community forums. https://preview.redd.it/bcdhftsba0351.jpg?width=864 amp;format=pjpg amp;auto=webp amp;s=4763c03a2d5ecaa082cfa78ed3693c0d7e1186e0 # Why should you stick to risk management? You can get a series of successful deals based on good luck. You can also get a series of bad deals that depend on luck and feel. It even happens to successful, experienced professional traders that they lose 10 trades in a row. Without risk management, this could result in your capital loss and final exit. The most important goal in trading is to stay in the market and preserve your capital. As long as you are in the market, you can recoup your losses. If you lose 10% of your capital, this means that you must make a profit of 11.1%. If your budget is $ 1,000 and you lose $ 100 ( \~ to 10%), you #8217;ll have $ 900. $ 100 is 11.1% of that. This means that losses hurt more than profits of the same size. This becomes worse with more losses. If you lose 50% of your capital, you must double your money to offset the loss. The new trader #8217;s rule for managing at most risk is 1% of the capital for each trade. If you lose 10 deals in a row (which is unlikely) and lose 1% each time, how much do you have left? Still 90%. If you risk 2%, what remains for you after losing 10 recurring deals is only 81% of the capital. You have to make 11% or 23% profit to make up for it. Even if you lose 100 deals in a row with a 1% risk management plan in hand, you still have 37%. **A seasoned trader may use 2% occasionally. A trader who risks 10% disappears quickly.** You might be wondering, if I decide to follow risk management with just 1% in the deal, does this mean that I can only invest 1% of the capital for each transaction? No. This is the ratio for determining the maximum acceptance of a loss from a single trade. **Initial decisions** I assume you know your total capital, no matter if it is $ 100 or $ 1 billion. The main point is to have a specific budget available. Do not use borrowed money, which you have to repay in a deadline. Do not use money you need in the future. If you are emotionally attached to this money, these emotions will make you feel stressed. You want to be a successful trader and not an emotional gambler. The next step is to find a deal. It does not matter if you do this daily and trade specific currencies or not. You have tools like fundamental and technical analysis to research deals. Immediately before entering into a trade, there is a basic calculation that must be performed: **Determine the entry price, stop loss and the amount of risk.** Well, the risk is easy. We already know that we will choose 1%. The entry price is also easy. It could be the current market price or the limit you set for your order. Now, stop loss: it is necessary to know and set the stop loss before entering a trade. Another rule is that you are not allowed to adjust your stop loss afterward to accept more losses. How to determine the stop loss? Technical analysis is the only method available regardless of the random selection of something. Perhaps you will use something like  #8220;beyond the next support level (or resistance) #8221; or  #8220;the other side of the trend line we just broke #8221;. Now we have the four components of risk management: budget size, entry price, stop-loss and risk-taking. The time to use the calculator. **The size of the deal** Now to find out how much money you are allowed to invest in this deal. Transaction Size = (Risk Size \* Budget) / (Entry Price  #8212; Stop Loss) For example: If you have a budget $ 1,000 and want to buy bitcoin for $ 2,300 with a stop loss $ 2,200 and a risk 1%, then this means: The deal size is (1% \* $ 1,000) / ($ 2,300  #8212; $ 2,200) ) = $ 10 / $ 100 = 0.1. So in this example you are allowed to buy 0.1 Bitcoin units for this trade. You must make this account before every trade! Even if you do, you will encounter errors sometimes, but risk management will help you to preserve your capital. Courage will shout at you to take greater risks, because you are very sure of your prediction. But always remember, to succeed you must stick to your stop loss and strategy. **Setting goals** Before entering into a position, you must also have a target price in mind for sale. The risk must be doubled. If you risk 1% of your capital, the potential profit must be 2 #8211;3% of your capital. If the goal for profit is equal to stopping the loss, you must stay away from trading and ignore this deal. This does not mean that you will always reach or lose your goal. You are allowed to manually track stop loss or exit early. However, the goal should be possible given the volatility of the market you are in. **Level of risk** Well, I got away from the plan and ignored your strategy. The deal entered without due diligence. whatever. How much risk did you just take? You know your budget, entry price and deal size. You must quickly define the next stop loss. How much risk? Risk = (Trade Size \* (Entry Point  #8212; Stop Loss)) / Budget For example, I bought 0.3 bitcoin at a price of $ 2,500 with a budget of $ 1,000. Stop loss is $ 2345. This means that the risk is (0.3 \* 155 dollars) / 1000 dollars = 4.64%. **Risk reduction** Now for some good things that can #8217;t be used practically, however, the concepts are sound. Why the reader may ask 1% risk? Is it just a rule? Is there an ideal ratio? In theory, yes there is. We can use the Kelly standard. The formula is simple: Risk = p-((1-p)/r Getting those variables P and R is difficult. You have to know your profit rate, which is the number of times your goals are reached. You also need a profit-to-loss ratio, which is the average profit per trade. For example, if you earn 47% of the time and 117% of your average capital, then the ideal risk is 1.7%. In practice you don #8217;t really know this specifically or variables p and r, so I recommend sticking to 1% as the basis for risk management. ## Risk Management Tips for Cryptocurrency Investment **1. You should never risk more than you can afford to lose.** However, this error is very common, especially among Crypto traders who are just starting out. The Crypto market is very difficult to predict, so traders who want to invest more than they can actually put themselves at risk of market and losing their money. **2. Don #8217;t trade by all of your capital at same time.** Anything can affect the Crypto market. The smallest news can affect the price of a particular currency in a negative or positive way. Instead of trade with everything you own #8221;, it is better to follow a more moderate path and trade reasonable amounts of your capital. **3. Improve your risk management performance** Fortunately, there are several ways to help avoiding these mistakes and avoid loss. You must have a well-tested trading plan that includes all the details of managing financial risk in Crypto. The trading plan should be practical  #8212; and you should be able to follow its steps easily. Experts recommend that it is better to focus on high-probability deals. Crypto trading involves a high degree of risk, so it is essential that you be disciplined in all of your financial transactions. You should also be able to pay extra attention to your past mistakes, and practice trading activities in a demo account first. The time and effort you spend in creating a trading plan is often considered a major investment that helps you achieve a profit-able future. **4. Control your emotions and risk management** As a Crypto trader, you need to be able to control your feelings and emotions towards your open, future, and closed positions as well! If you cannot control your feelings, you will not be able to reach a position where you can make the profits you want to trade. Market sentiment can often trap traders in volatile positions in the market. This is one of the most common market risk for Crypto trading. Those with stubborn nature tend not to do well in the Crypto market. These types of traders tend to wait too long to exit the trade. When a trader realizes his mistake, he must leave the market as soon as possible, to take the least possible loss. Waiting too long can cause you to lose a large portion of your capital. Once you exit the deal, you need to be patient and re-enter the market when it presents a real new opportunity. **5. Basic concepts in risk management** To reduce the financial market risk for trading Cryptocurrency, you will need to remember some of the basic points mentioned below: The evaluation of money changes, and often affects companies and individuals participating in global stock exchanges. Liabilities, assets and fund flows are affected by changes in exchange rates. By trading small amounts of your capital and monitoring market movements, you will be able to see these concepts take hold throughout your daily trading sessions. **6. Important tips for developing a risk management plan model** Below is a series of simple tips that you can consider and include in the financial risk management plan model when trading Crypto, which may help you reduce trading losses associated with market risks: **1. Stop losses** Trading without a stop loss is like driving a car without braking at full speed  #8212; it won #8217;t end well. Likewise, once your stop loss is set, you should never lower it. There is no point in having a safety net in place if you are not going to use it properly. The goal of stopping a loss is to limit the size of the potential loss in order to be able to in-crease your total profits, and what needs to be done on the other side is to set profit-taking orders as well! **2. Do not link all your investments in one place** This applies to all types of investment, and Crypto is no exception. Crypto should be part of your portfolio, but not complete it. Another way that you can expand it is to invest or trade more than one crypto coin. **3. The general trend is your companion** You may have made the decision to be a long-term trader, with plans to keep these deals for an extended period of time. However, regardless of the deal you ultimately decided to take, you should not resist current market trends or movements. There will always be strong players in the market, and the best way to keep up with them is to absorb such changes and follow the general trend, and change your strategies to reflect this. **4. Keep teaching yourself** The best way to learn the financial risk management system in Crypto and become an efficient and successful Crypto trader is to know how the market works. However, as we mentioned earlier, the market is constantly changing, so if you want to stay ahead of your game, you have to be always ready to learn new things and update yourself about market changes. **5. Use the plug-in** To advance in Crypto, you may want to use some trading software that can help you settle your choices. However, these systems are not ideal, so it is best to use them as a consulting tool, and something to refer to rather than use as a basis for making business decisions. **6. Limiting the use of leverage** It can be very tempting to use leverage to make big profits. However, this can make it easy for you to lose a huge portion of your capital, too. So do not support the use of giant leverage. All it takes is one quick change in market direction, and you can easily delete your entire trading account. Crypto risk management is not difficult to understand and implement. But in order to invest in any financial instruments, whether it be bonds, exchange-traded funds, stocks, contracts for the difference in prices or cryptocurrencies, you need to acquire advanced knowledge in the field of risk management. The hard part is having enough self-discipline to adhere to the rules of this risk management plan as the market moves against your positions. *The content is for opinion sharing only and should not be relied upon to make any investment decisions.*</TEXT>

    <TITLE>Introduction to Cryptocurrencies  #8212; CET, the King of Public Chain Tokens that Has Gone through Thick and Thin</TITLE>
    <DATE>2020-06-05 07:07:56</DATE>
    <TEXT>*Written by the CoinEx Institution, this series of jocular and easy to understand articles will show you everything you need to know about major cryptocurrencies, making you fully prepared before jumping into crypto!*  #8203; https://preview.redd.it/zjz4s25uj1351.jpg?width=1024 amp;format=pjpg amp;auto=webp amp;s=15bf3acdaa80d054cd38f101a2bafd3a0d2a4a66 CET (CoinEx Token) is the native token of CoinEx DEX (Decentralized Exchange), the world #8217;s first dedicated public chain to decentralized transactions. Launched in January 2018 by CoinEx, a global well-known digital asset trading service provider under ViaBTC, CET does not only exist as an exchange-based token, but plays the role of the base currency for the entire ecosystem of CoinEx Chain, and obtains richer application scenarios and higher empowerment. As a token of a decentralized trading public chain, CET has attracted much attention in the industry with promising future. **Post-1990s entrepreneur Yang Haipo joined hands with Copernicus team to create CoinEx** Yang Haipo, the Founder and CEO of ViaBTC Group, is an entrepreneur born in the 1990s. He graduated from Northwestern Polytechnical University in 2012 with a major in mathematics and applied mathematics. He once worked at Tencent TEG / Weibo and Futu Securities. In 2011, when Yang Haipo was still in college, he got to know Bitcoin, and became one of the earliest Bitcoin investors. In 2014, this insightful young man seized the opportunity and bought Bitcoin at the full position. After leaving Tencent, Yang engaged in the mining industry, and served as the technical leader of Zeus Technology (one of the top three SCRYPT mining machine brands in the world) as a start of his entrepreneurship in this field. In March 2016, Haipo threw himself into the deployment and development of the Bitcoin mining pool, and independently completed the entire code of the ViaBTC (ViaBTC Technology Limited) mining pool, which successfully went online 2 months later. That is also the world  #8217;s first BCH mining pool. ViaBTC is not only the biggest BCH mining pool but also the fifth-largest Bitcoin mining pool. It not only elaborates on the vision of  #8220;making the world better through Bitcoin #8221;, but also expresses Haipo #8217;s belief in the industry. Later Haipo found that the exchange could provide the industry with important functions of asset issuance and value discovery, which is the core of the entire industry. That is why he decided to devote himself to the development of the exchange. In March 2017, ViaBTC, led by Yang Haipo, received a 20-million-yuan Series A funding led by Bitmain to expand the exchange business. In December of the same year, Haipo established CoinEx. CoinEx has taken on an irresistible momentum soon after its establishment, and attained great achievements within only two years: In January 2018, CoinEx launched CET, a user value-added service privilege; In July 2018, it ranked first among the global exchanges by trading volume; In March 2019, it partnered with the Matrixport team to develop a new generation of high-performance public chain CoinEx Chain; In September 2019, it became one of the management platforms with the most extensive global product layout; In November 2019, it rolled out DEX, the world #8217;s first decentralized transaction dedicated public chain; In December 2019, CoinEx acquired the Estonian digital asset trading license In March 2020, CoinEx integrated the first fiat onramp with Simplex In April 2020, it Formed global strategic partnership with Matrixport In May 2020, ViaBTC Group announced strategic upgrade #8230; #8230; At the same time, CoinEx is also one of the first trading platforms to obtain a compliance license. It provides diversified derivatives trading services such as spot trading, leveraged trading, and perpetual contracts. Moreover, the platform supports 15 languages including Chinese/English/Japanese/ Korean/Russian to provide safe and reliable transaction services for more than 1 million users in more than 100 countries and regions. At present, CoinEx has also attracted countless  #8220;CET believers #8221;. **A deep look into CoinEx and CoinEx DEX** Many people may ask: What do CoinEx Chain and CoinEx DEX do, and how do them relate to CET? Before revealing more details about CET, let #8217;s take a look at these questions\~ **CoinEx Chain is the world #8217;s first public chain specifically designed for decentralized exchanges. Its Mainnet was officially launched in November 2019.** CoinEx Chain contains 3 dedicated public chains, namely DEX Chain dedicated to decentralized transactions, Smart Chain dedicated to smart contracts, and Privacy Chain dedicated to user privacy and security protection. The innovative approach of  #8220;three chains in one #8221; turns out to be a perfect solution to scalability, decentralization and security, known as the  #8220;impossible triangle #8221; of the blockchain. At present, many domestic public chain teams still face the  #8220;blockchain trilemma #8221;, but not CoinEx Chain. On CoinEx Chain, all tokens, not just CET, are free to cross the three chains, thus enabling more possibilities for transactions. CoinEx DEX is the world #8217;s first dedicated public chain for decentralized transactions. The shortcomings of many DEXs in the market lie in the failure to improve users #8217; trading experience, which is exactly what CoinEx DEX is committed to solving. Under the premise of decentralization, CoinEx DEX offers customers the experience approximately equal to that of a centralized exchange, with faster block speeds, higher TPS and better wallets. **CET is not only a token for the platform but also one for the public chain** After the introduction of concepts of both CoinEx Chain and CoinEx DEX, let #8217;s talk about CET. As a user value-added service privilege in the CoinEx ecosystem and also the token of CoinEx Chain, **CET acts as a tool and currency in the entire CoinEx Chain ecosystem, which can be circulated and used in various scenarios.** Since its launch, CET has been distributed by various means such as airdrops, transaction fee refunds, operation promotions and team unlocking. On January 31, 2019, the CoinEx Team burnt all the 4 billion unreleased onesand continued to repurchase CET from the secondary market. This move caused quite a stir in the industry. **CET is not only a token for the platform but also one for the public chain. Therefore, without any doubt, CET outshines other platform tokens in terms of value:** **1. The daily CET repurchase** For better transparency of the CET repurchase and burning mechanism, CoinEx officially announced that from April 11, 2020, it would adjust the CET repurchase and burning policy by changing the previous quarterly repurchase policy to daily repurchase. After its activation, CoinEx repurchases CET in the secondary market with 50% of its daily profits from transaction fees everyday and burns them at the end of each quarter. Along with the new plan, an independent page designed to display the relevant information was also launched, including circulating supply, circulating market value, daily repurchase quantity, etc, enabling users to view repurchase and burning details clearly. By doing so, CoinEx achieves 100% transparency. **2. Preferential deduction of platform transaction fees** CoinEx users can use CET to directly deduct equivalent transaction fees and enjoy exclusive discounts when trading. **3. VIP service** Users can be VIPs by holding a certain amount of CET or directly purchase the VIP privilege with CET. VIPs are entitled to such privileges as discounted rates, accelerated withdrawals and exclusive customer service. **4. Privileges for special activities** CET holders can enjoy special privileges in marketing activities of the platform, such as entrance tickets to token airdrops or high-quality project acceleration opportunities. **5. Election for nodes to participate in community governance** CET holders who meet the quantity requirements can campaign for nodes and participate in the launch and voting of CoinEx Chain proposals as part of community governance. **6. Staking returns** CET holders can vote for validators and can participate in the Staking economy of CoinEx Chain for Staking returns. **7. Easier trading on CoinEx DEX** On the DEX public chain, users can send and receive CET tokens, and can also create tokens and related trading pairs based on their needs. Moreover, they can perform operations such as additional issuance, burning, locking, and unlocking of tokens, place orders and query transaction history. **8. More CET privileges** Haipo once said:  #8220;As the native token of CoinEx Chain, CET will no longer only be the platform token of the exchange. It will have a higher value as the native token of the public chain ecosystem. Its value no longer depends solely on the income of the exchange, but also comes from the consensus from a growing user base, with CET being a tool or currency. As more people use it, the consensus is generated and higher value is created. In addition, **CET was decentralized through the decentralized public chain.** The exchange can be gone, but not the public chain. CET will be given more vitality. #8221; It can thus be clear that **CoinEx #8217;s ambition goes beyond a public chain towards a decentralized public chain ecosystem.** The public chain usually represents the current development direction and the latest research results of the mainstream blockchain technology. In this regard, efforts to develop public chains are of great guiding significance to explore blockchain technology and apply it to the physical industry. We have every confidence that CET will become a king of the new generation of public chain tokens.  #8220;CET believers #8221; also have a great faith in its future value and ecological promotion. **Despite all the twists and turns ahead, CET is bound to blaze a trail and lead the industry.** # About CoinEx As a global and professional cryptocurrency exchange service provider, CoinEx was founded in December 2017 with Bitmain-led investment and has obtained a legal license in Estonia. It is a subsidiary brand of the ViaBTC Group, which owns the fifth largest BTC mining pool, which is also the largest of BCH mining, in the world.

    <TITLE>Monero, the Most Private Cryptocurrency</TITLE>
    <DATE>2020-06-12 04:28:38</DATE>
    <TEXT>*Written by the CoinEx Institution, this series of jocular and easy to understand articles will show you everything you need to know about major cryptocurrencies, making you fully prepared before jumping into crypto!*  #8203; https://preview.redd.it/ryvcznqspe451.jpg?width=720 amp;format=pjpg amp;auto=webp amp;s=5fa91e26288d7b0a624113ed21172cc9fd5624a3 Monero, or XMR for short, is an open-source cryptocurrency that is safe, reliable, private, and untraceable. It can run on Windows, Mac, Linux, and FreeBSD, and is known as one of the most private cryptocurrencies. In 2018, Monero already ranked 10th in terms of trading volume, with its market value beyond 1 billion US dollars, an evidence for its great fame in this field. By a special method in cryptography, Monero ensures that all transactions remain 100% irrelevant and untraceable. Perhaps after reading this article, you will understand why it is so special and popular in the increasingly transparent and traceable cryptocurrency circle (After all privacy comes first!). In fact, many large cryptocurrencies in the world are not anonymous. All transactions on Bitcoin and Ethereum are made public and traceable, which means that anyone can eavesdrop on transactions flowing into and out of the wallet. That has given rise to a new type of cryptocurrency called  #8220;privacy currency #8221;! These  #8220;privacy currencies #8221; hide encrypted transactions by adopting specific types of passwords. One typical example is Monero, one of the largest privacy cryptocurrencies in the world. Monero was created on April 18, 2014 under the name BitMonero, literally the combination of Bit (Bitcoin) and Monero (the  #8220;coin #8221; in Esperanto). In five days, the community decided to change its name to Monero. Interestingly, Monero #8217;s creators valued personal privacy and tried to behave in a low-key manner with pseudonyms instead of the real names. It is said that the Monero major contributor #8217;s nickname is  #8220;thankful for today #8221;, yet this guy has gradually disappeared from public view as Monero developed day by day. Unlike many cryptocurrencies derived from BTC, Monero is based on the CryptoNote protocol. It is also the first branch based on the Bytecoin of CryptoNote currency. Here is some information about Bytecoin: BCN, for short, is a decentralized cryptocurrency with a high degree of privacy; it has open-source codes that allow everyone to contribute to the development of the Bytecoin network; and the Bytecoin network provides global users with instant private transactions that are not traceable and at no additional cost. Yet, as a branch of BCN, Monero outshines its parent in reputation by being different in two ways. First, Monero #8217;s target block time was reduced from 120 seconds to 60 seconds; second, the issuance speed was cut by 50% (which reverted to 120-second residence later, with the issuance time maintained and the reward for each new block doubled). By the way, during the fork, the Monero developers also found a lot of low-quality codes and then refactored them. (That is exactly what geeks will do) Monero #8217;s modular code structure was also highly appreciated by Wladimir J. van der Laan, one of the core maintainers of Bitcoin. Monero values privacy, decentralization and scalability, and there are significant algorithm differences in blockchain fuzzification, which sets it apart from its peers. How private is it? Here are more details. **1. Safe and reliable** For a decentralized cryptocurrency, decentralization means that its network is operated by users; transactions are confirmed by decentralized consensus and then recorded on the blockchain irrevocably. Monero needs no third party to guarantee the safety of funds; **2. Privacy protection** Monero confuses all transaction sources, amounts, and recipients through ring signatures, ring confidential transactions, and invisible addresses. Apart from all the advantages of a decentralized cryptocurrency, it is by no means inferior in safeguarding privacy; **3. Unable to track** The sender, the receiver and the transaction amount of all Monero transactions must be anonymous by default. The information on the Monero Blockchain cannot be matched with physical individuals or specific users, so there is no trace to track; **4. Scalable** Everyone knows that Bitcoin #8217;sability to process transactions has always been limited by the scalability issue; as we have mentioned before in the introduction of Bitcoin, the block size of 1MB makes things difficult. But Monero #8217;s developers have created a system that allows the network to process more transactions when needed; what #8217;s more, Monero does not have any  #8220;pre-set #8221; restrictions on block size. Of course, this also means that some malicious miners may block the system with large blocks. To prevent this from happening, Monero has worked out countermeasures: the block reward penalty of the system. On October 18, 2018, Monero #8217;s latest hard fork changed the consensus mechanism algorithm to CrypotoNight V8. In this hard fork, it introduced the BulletProff bulletproof protocol, which can also effectively reduce the transaction fee of miners without disclosing transactions It is said that Monero will issue about 18.4 million XMR in around 8 years. Moreover, it eclipses its counterparts in distribution  #8212; with no pre-mining or pre-sale, all block rewards will be left to miners by means of the POW mechanism. Here is the reward scheme of Monero in two stages: 1. Acceleration: mine 18132000 XMR before May 2022; 2. Deceleration: Deceleration starts right after 18132000 XMR are mined, and there will be a reward of 0.6XMR for each block mined afterwards. In this way, the overall supply will be kept on a small scale and decelerated. Monero is also excellent in its development concept that is designed to be anti-ASIC from the very beginning. Here is a brief introduction to ASIC (Special Application Integrated Circuit). Due to the specificity of ASICs, specially designed ASICs can usually have much higher hashrate than general CPUs, GPUs, and even FPGAs  #8212; that makes hashrate excessively centralized and makes it vulnerable to the monopoly of single centralized institutions. Yet the cryptonight algorithm used by Monero allows most CPUs and even FPGAs to get involved and get mining rewards, instead of making GPU the only one that can efficiently mine. In other words, Monero #8217;s core development team will modify the consensus mechanism algorithm and have a hard fork after some time to ensure its strength against ASIC and the monopoly of hashrate. However, although Monero has been designed against ASICs to avoid centralization, nearly 43% of its hashrate is still owned by 3 mining pools; in addition, it is not a BTC-based currency, making it even harder to introduce some elements. Of course, Monero is not that newbie-friendly, and thus has not been widely accepted. Yet each cryptocurrency has its own features. As long as Monero keeps improving its privacy, it will definitely attract increasing followers. If you are interested in Monero, welcome to CoinEx for exchange or trade. ## About CoinEx As a global and professional cryptocurrency exchange service provider, CoinEx was founded in December 2017 with Bitmain-led investment and has obtained a legal license in Estonia.

    <TITLE>Report on Filecoin And PoC Projects</TITLE>
    <DATE>2020-06-23 04:36:33</DATE>
    <TEXT>***Author:*** *Gamals Ahmed, CoinEx Business Ambassador* **ABSTRACT** A Blockchain is a continuously growing record, called blocks, which are linked and secured using cryptography such as hashing. Each block contains a hash pointer as a link to the previous block, a timestamp and transaction data. Filecoin is a decentralized storage network that turns cloud storage into an algorithmic market. The market runs on a blockchain with a native protocol token (also called Filecoin), which miners earn by providing storage to clients. The first section of report is demonstrate the filecoin which is a decentralized storage system used to encrypt files that we need to share it through blockchain platform. The second section is explain briefly blockchain Proof of Concept (POC) which is a process of locate whether a Blockchain project idea can be feasible in a real-world situation, need of proof of concept and blockchain proof of concept stages. **1.Introduction** Filecoin is a protocol token whose blockchain runs on a novel proof, called Proof-of-Space time, where blocks are created by miners that are storing data. Filecoin protocol provides a data storage and retrieval service via a network of independent storage providers that does not rely on a single coordinator, where: (1) clients pay to store and retrieve data, (2) Storage Miners earn tokens by offering storage (3) Retrieval Miners earn tokens by serving data. Filecoin is a decentralized storage network that turns cloud storage into an algorithmic market. The market runs on a blockchain with a native protocol token (also called Filecoin #8221;), which miners earn by providing storage to clients. Conversely, clients spend Filecoin hiring miners to store or distribute data. As with Bitcoin, Filecoin miners compete to mine blocks with sizable rewards\[1\]. Filecoin mining power is proportional to active storage, which directly provides a useful service to clients (unlike Bitcoin mining, whose usefulness is limited to maintaining blockchain consensus). This creates a powerful incentive for miners to amass as much storage as they can, and rent it out to clients. The protocol weaves these amassed resources into a self-healing storage network that anybody in the world can rely on. The network achieves robustness by replicating and dispersing content, while automatically detecting and repairing replica failures. Clients can select replication parameters to protect against different threat models. The protocol #8217;s cloud storage network also provides security, as content is encrypted end-to-end at the client, while storage providers do not have access to decryption keys. Filecoin works as an incentive layer on top of IPFS \[1\], which can provide storage infrastructure for any data. It is especially useful for decentralizing data, building and running distributed applications, and implementing smart contracts \[2\]. Filecoin\[2\] based on IPFS\[3\] proposes a completely decentralized distributed storage network where customers and storage miners request services and submit orders to the storage and retrieval markets. And the miner provides a service to view matching quotes to initiate a transaction. The protocol guarantees the integrity of data storage by copying proofs and space-time certificates. The Filecoin protocol writes the order book, token transactions, and integrity challenge response records to the blockchain. **1.1 Blockchain** Blockchain is a characteristic data structure formed by combining data blocks in a chain order inchronological order\[4\], and cryptographically guarantees decentralized, non-tamperable, unforgeable distributed shared ledger system. [ Figure 1 Blockchain Structure ](https://preview.redd.it/2w97z8ax8l651.jpg?width=559 amp;format=pjpg amp;auto=webp amp;s=db39f056629ff64254d2a1f8982ffc3ed598d51f) **1.2 Elementary Components in Filecoin** The Filecoin protocol builds upon four novel components : 1. **Decentralized Storage Network (DSN):** We provide an abstraction for network of independent storage providers to offer storage and retrieval services. 2. **Novel Proofs-of-Storage:** We present two novel Proofs-of-Storage,(1) Proof-of Replication allows storage providers to prove that data has been replicated to its own uniquely dedicated physical storage. Enforcing unique physical copies enables a verifier to check that a prover is not deduplicating multiple copies of the data into the same storage space, (2) Proof-of-Space time allows storage providers to prove they have stored some data throughout a specified amount of time. 3. **Verifiable Markets:** We model storage requests and retrieval requests as orders in two decentralized verifiable markets operated by the Filecoin network. Verifiable markets ensure that payments are performed when a service has been correctly provided. We present the Storage Market and the Retrieval Market where miners and clients can respectively submit storage and retrieval orders. 4. **Useful Proof-of-Work:** We show how to construct a useful Proof-of-Work based on Proof-of Space time that can be used in consensus protocols. Miners do not need to spend wasteful computation to mine blocks, but instead must store data in the network\[2\] \[4\]. **1.3 Filecoin: Lifecycle of a File** In this section we mentioned the lifecycle for file in Filecoin, as follow: 1. Put: Clients send information about the file, storage duration, and a small amount of Filecoin to the Storage Market as a bid. Simultaneously, Miners submit asks, competing to offer low cost storage. Deals are made in the Storage Market, on the blockchain. 2. Send: The Client then sends the file to the Miner, and the Miner adds the file to a sector. The sectors are cryptographically sealed, with verification sent to the blockchain. 3. Manage: Miners continuously prove they are storing all sectors they agreed to store. The client #8217;s payment is released in installments. Additional currency is minted over time and awarded to Miners as a block reward, proportional to the storage they provide. 4. Request: A Client requests a file with some payment in Filecoin to the Retrieval Market (off chain); the first Miner to send the file is paid. Eventually, the contract expires and the storage is once again free\[5\]. [ Figure 2 Filecoin Lifecycle of a File ](https://preview.redd.it/y59851z09l651.jpg?width=544 amp;format=pjpg amp;auto=webp amp;s=f7fd9f349a58d3e43d685dae3ffa4af44b74dd64) **1.4 Filecoin is Built with IPFS** The Interplanetary File System (IPFS) is a next-generation protocol to make the Web faster, safer, decentralized, and permanent. Since the initial IPFS release in January 2015, it has gained strong traction in a variety of industries and organizations. Today, IPFS is a foundational technology for many applications in the blockchain industry. Over 5 billion files have been added to IPFS, spanning scientific data and papers, genetic research, video distribution  amp; streaming, 3D modeling, legal documents, entire blockchains and their transactions, video games, and more. IPFS and Filecoin are complementary protocols, and the adoption of the underlying IPFS protocol is a leading indicator of market demand for a faster, safer, decentralized storage service \[6\]. **Some IPFS Users** [ Figure\(3\) IPFS users ](https://preview.redd.it/mjz03i159l651.jpg?width=630 amp;format=pjpg amp;auto=webp amp;s=acb244439e0edffab0be2991e40d5ba2071ab093) **1.5 IPFS Open Source Community** The IPFS Project is a large community of open source contributors driven to decentralize the web. The community is made up of thousands of developers and users who have been working together for several years, building valuable and widely used software tools. The same seasoned core developers of IPFS are also leading the design and development of Filecoin. The IPFS team has experience building ambitious sotware projects and coordinating thriving developer communities. A significant portion of the IPFS community plans to join the Filecoin network, building tools and applications on this new, exciting platform \[ 7\]. **2. PoC PROJECTS:** **2.1 What is PoC?** PoC is abbreviate of Project of Concept which is a process of determining whether a Block-chain project idea can be feasible in a real-world situation. This process is necessary to verify that the idea will function as envisioned. The best part about proof of concept blockchain meaning is that it will help you to get a clear idea of what you are doing before you even get started. Furthermore, the proof of concept in the blockchain niche isn #8217;t for exploring the marketplace for ideas only. Moreover, you won #8217;t determine the best way to start the production process. Instead, you #8217;ll only work on your possible blockchain solution option and see whether it #8217;s capable of being a reality or not. Developing a blockchain proof of concept would require an investment of time, money and resources. In reality, you #8217;d need to get your hands on supporting technologies or even the physical components needed to get the perfect plan. Going through the process is necessary for enterprises to see whether their idea is visible before using all production level equipment for it. According to a recent Gartner survey, 66% of CIOs think that blockchain is here to disrupt the existing marketplaces. And many will spend more than $10 million on the experimentation of the technology. So, if you were confused with what is proof of concept blockchain, now you know just what it is \[8\]. PoC is used to demonstrate the feasibility and practical potential of any blockchain project in any field such as Energy, Communication, Services, Insurance and Healthcare. A PoC can either be a prototype without any supporting code or any MVP (Minimum Viable Product) with bare feature set. A PoC is a prototype that is used for internal organization who can have a better understanding of a particular project. **2.3 Why Companies Need a Proof of Concept?** Usually, the blockchain proof of concept is awfully popular among the startups in the market. However, proof of concept in blockchain can also be a great tool for the Enterprises as well. Mainly there are three points for needing it. * Test out the blockchain project before going for mass production. * Identify possible pain points that can make the project not useful. * Save an enormous amount of time and money. Although anyone who comes up with a blockchain project idea will think that it will work, however, proof of concept in blockchain will test out your idea to ensure that you get the best version out of it, which will save up a lot of time and money in the process. Another major reason for you to use proof of concept for blockchain is to ensure that all the stakeholders love your idea and would be interested in investing in it. Whether you are just adding up a new type of feature in the existing blockchain solution or developing it from scratch blockchain proof of concept would let you take the fastest route possible. This relatively gives a different edge in the proof of concept blockchain meaning \[9\]. **2.4 Proof of Concept Phases** Its explain as follows: [ Figure \(4\) explains the steps of blockchain PoC ](https://preview.redd.it/qimdjfi89l651.jpg?width=1149 amp;format=pjpg amp;auto=webp amp;s=e8ba9092e8857ccaa7b06ae3800c7aa103cb9eae) **Step-1: Finding the Proper Blockchain Application Sectors That Adds Value** Let #8217;s start with the first step of the theoretical build-up stage. Many of you don #8217;t really know which application sectors are great for blockchain Proof of concept \[10\]. That #8217;s why we are outlining some major application sector where you can use your solution. These are: **1.Finance** Let #8217;s start with the financing sector. This sector is relatively popular among the blockchain community. Furthermore, there are many projects already that cover this sector and offer a lucrative solution for major issues. So, in that sense, this sector is quite competitive in case of blockchain PoC development. **2. Medical** The medical sector is another major blockchain application sector at present. There are count-less scenarios where blockchain can truly shine. Hospitals have to deal with a lot of falsifying reports and counterfeit drugs. **3. Asset Management** Maintaining asset in these times are relatively hard due to all the bad players in the market. Simple paper-based record keeping isn #8217;t enough now. Moreover, due to political and other reasons, ownership management is at risk of becoming a corrupted sector. **4. Government** Many governmental institutions are falling behind in the race of digitization. Moreover, every citizen needs a better infrastructure which will give them the security they need. In reality, the government sector is unable to reserve the citizen rights properly. **5. Identity** Identity management is a big hassle when it comes to enterprises. Furthermore, many often impersonate other people #8217;s identity and commit serious crimes. Even in trade financer, many companies have to deal with fake companies and fake documents. **6. IoT** Internet of things is a wonderful sector for proof of concept in blockchain development. Furthermore, this sector is responsible for linking all your smart applications together. Moreover, the device to device connection in a secured platform is necessary. **7. Payments** The payments sector is another awesome application point for your enterprise-grade solution. The blockchain system is more than capable of handling payments, and many of it also offer micro payments. Furthermore, it takes a really small amount of time to send money compared to the traditional banking system. Not to mention the reduction of fees in overseas payment. **8. Supply Chain** Big enterprise needs to have their eyes and ears in every step of the supply chain process. Furthermore, any minor errors could end up in a million dollars of loss. Obviously, you would not want that. Tracking where the raw materials are coming from and whether your products are truly authentic or not is one of the major pain points. **9. Insurance** The insurance industry is facing some serious problems regarding insurance claims and document authentication. Also, the enormous amount of paperwork that every single employee has to fill out is overly dreadful. Detecting fraud, managing all the documents in a secure environment is tough. So, if you introduce a blockchain framework that can solve all these issues would be a huge factor. However, the competition in this marketplace is a bit high; still, with proper blockchain proof of concept, it should be a great opportunity. **Step-2: Defining the Product** In the second stage of the theoretical build-up, you would need to think your blockchain Proof of concept just like any other product. Furthermore, you need to have a solid plan along with full support from all stakeholders. PoC Feature Requirements Define all the features that your enterprise blockchain solution needs. After deciding your blockchain application, you would probably have some idea on what features to add up. **Step-3: Investigating the Technology** After you #8217;ve come up with the solid idea of what features to include and how to focus the road map, you would need to hand them off to the engineering team. Therefore, your team will then research the technology based on your requirements and come up with the best plat-form to develop it on. * Advice to make a successful Proof of Concept As we knew, a proof of concept is a project, and like any project it must be clearly defined. That means breaking down the process into these four steps in order to can manage it better. * Focus on a Specific Business Issue If you want to make the blockchain PoC framework a success, then you have to start with focusing your real-life problems. At the beginning of the theoretical build-up stage when you are looking for a popular sector of deployment, look for a specific issue. Furthermore, any problem that your idea can fix would be a big plus from the consumers #8217; end. Many blockchain proof of concept only focuses on the capabilities of the technology only. However, they just don #8217;t resolve any new issues or even old issues. * Take Small Steps, Avoid Scope Creeps Another major thing that the enterprises face is the scope creeps. While choosing what features you might need for the blockchain proof of concept many go for too much from the start. However, making a flashier entrance in the market won #8217;t mean 100% success. Further-more, get the ones that you can truly deliver, not the ones you aren #8217;t capable of. * Connect All Ideas and Control Them You won #8217;t be the only one coming up with all the ideas. As you already know you #8217;d need to get yourself a good team that will back you up and helps you come up with a compact solution. However, not every single member of your team would agree with the same idea. Furthermore, they have different ideas and vision regarding the blockchain development too. * Construct a Thorough Plan Another hurdle in the way of proper proof of concept blockchain is the misinterpretation of the blockchain implementation challenges. Obviously, blockchain implementation isn #8217;t an easy task. At the first stage, it might have many flaws that would end up in possible failure scenarios. * Test A Million Times After getting the design done, you #8217;d need to go into the testing phase. However, the problem is many seem to enroll the MVP before properly testing it, which end up in failure. So, test out the MVP a lot of time before making it accessible to the end-users. * Collaborate With Other Parties Collaborating with other enterprises could help to take down the overall costing of the block-chain proof of concept. Furthermore, if you are a small to medium level enterprise than collaborating with other parties could help out with the production costing. It will solely depend on the feature or the type of blockchain PoC framework you want to work on. * The Right Amount of Staff The right amount of stuff is always necessary to pull off a blockchain proof of concept project. Furthermore, you would need to recruit staffs that have blockchain skills or have an intellectual concept of the technology. Get the necessary amount of stuff with blockchain skill set to perfect the Blockchain Proof of Concept.. **3. Conclusion** This report explain a distributed storage scheme based on blockchain technology( Filecoin), and introduces the system design in detail in first part , we have studied about blockchain technology related for Filecoin(decentralized storage network), Filecoin, a highly-anticipated decentralized storage network (under development), announced that there will be more delays before its Mainnet can be officially launched. Created by Protocol Labs, Filecoin has been developed using the InterPlanetary File System (IPFS), an established peer to peer data storage network. The Filecoin software will allow users to trade storage space in an open and decentralized market place.In the second part we mentioned a proof of concept (PoC), The Blockchain Proof of Concept is a demonstration to verify that certain concepts or theories have the potential for real-world application. PoC represents the evidence demonstrating that a project or product is feasible and worthy enough to justify the expenses needed to support and develop it. **REFERENCES** \[1\] Juan Benet.

    <TITLE>Near Protocol Analysis by CoinEx Ambassador Garet Johan</TITLE>
    <DATE>2020-07-15 01:42:41</DATE>
    <TEXT>*Author: Garet Johan, CoinEx Ambassador* Based on San Francisco, California, United States Founded Date July 1, 2018 NEAR is a sharded, developer-friendly, proof-of-stake blockchain. Put another way, it is like a public community-run cloud platform. That means it is a highly scalable, low cost platform for developers to create decentralized apps on top of. **Functions:** Allow developers to build blockchain native mobile dApps and run it where the users are (mobile phones), giving developers a key onramp into dApps. Through sharding by state, allow the blockchain to scale close to linearly with the number of nodes in a network. Allow blockchain entrepreneurs to quickly iterate and come up with successful business models since they both have scalable blockchain and easy access to users via first mobile-native blockchain. **Problems to be solved:** Building better tools for developers High transactions per second trough sharding technology More decentralization **Business:** Fundamentally, the NEAR platform is a marketplace between willing participants. On the supply side, operators of the validator nodes and other fundamental infrastructure need to be incentivized to provide these services which make up the  #8220;community cloud. #8221; On the demand side, the developers and end-users of the platform who are paying for its use need to be able to do so in a way which is simple, clear and consistent so it helps them. Micro level to create new business models by directly compensating the developers who create its most useful applications. Macro level by coordinating the efforts of a broader set of ecosystem participants who participate in everything from education to governance. **Business Model:** NEAR is a protocol and also a platform that uses the blockchain to create a place where developers can use the blockchain where the token has the use of staking and making the governance possible and paid for transaction fees, amongst other things. Epoch Rewards Node operators are paid for their service a fixed percentage of total supply as a  #8220;security #8221; fee of roughly 4.5% annualized. Protocol treasury: In addition to validators, the protocol treasury receives 0.5% of total supply annually to continuously re-invest into ecosystem development. **Transaction Costs:** Usage of the network consumes two separate kinds of resources  #8212; instantaneous and long term. Instantaneous costs are generated by every transaction because each transaction requires the usage of both the network itself and some of its computation resources. These are priced together as a mostly-predictable cost per transaction, which is paid in NEAR tokens. COMPUTE AND BANDWIDTH ( #8220;GAS #8221;) Compute (CPU) is a momentary resource spent on executing a transaction. The cost of each CPU instruction is denominated in  #8220;gas #8221; units and its price is determined based on the slowly adjusted price of gas (denominated in NEAR tokens) Storage Costs: Storage is a long term cost because storing data represents an ongoing burden to the nodes of the network. Storage costs are covered by maintaining minimum balance of NEAR tokens on the account or contract. This provides an indirect mechanism of payment via inflation to validators for maintaining contract and account state on their nodes. Inflation: Inflation is the combination of payouts to validators and the protocol treasury minus the collected transaction fees (and a few other NEAR burning mechanics like the name auction. Overall, the maximum inflation is 5%, which can go down over time as network gets more usage and more transactions fees are burned. It #8217;s possible that inflation becomes negative (total supply decreases) if there are enough fees burned. Security Thresholds: Some thresholds which provide for good behavior among participants are set using economic incentives. **Economic Stakeholders** Validators: Provide the computational resource and security for the network by running nodes. Developers: Create the applications which run atop the network Token Holders: Accounts or applications which maintain token balances NEAR Foundation: An independent entity which coordinates the governance and technical evolution efforts of the network participants. Third Party Observers: The observers of the chain who provide extra fraud and bad behavior protection. Users: Users of applications on the network who do not maintain token balances. **Team Information** The Near team is comprised of competitive programming champions and veterans from several major tech companies, such as Google, Facebook and Niantic. YC alum and CEO Alex Skidanov was the first employee at the sharded database company MemSQL and CTO Illia Polosukhin was a core contributor to Google #8217;s TensorFlow machine learning library while working in their prestigious research division. The Near engineering team includes a 2-time ICPC world champion, 3 gold medalists and multiple finalists plus the business team has deep experience building and scaling technical startups.

This will be allocated in the following way, where each category is described in greater detail in the following sections: [ ](https://preview.redd.it/43e7bqljdxa51.jpg?width=1536 amp;format=pjpg amp;auto=webp amp;s=8d95c7eb775ff308dfe5f4f26c2802bebc227c70) Achievements 2019 Achievements **Content** We launched our Whiteboard Series, which features a collection of over 30 deep-dives into various blockchain protocols. With finalising NEAR #8217;s design, we started our Lunch  amp; Learn Series on YouTube, providing a deep dive into the underlying mechanisms of NEAR protocol. Alex was live coding core features of the NEAR Protocol in October. **Research** Nightshade: Near Protocol Sharding Design Near Protocol Randomness Beacon Fast Finality and Resilience to Long Range Attacks with Proof of Space-Time and Casper-like Finality Gadget Doomslug: block confirmation with single round of communication, and a finality gadget with guaranteed liveness The NEAR Foundation (https://near.foundation) is, at the broadest level, the steward of the \*full\* NEAR purpose. This foundation is an independent nonprofit entity based in Switzerland whose charter directly contains the words of that Purpose. To fulfill it, the Foundation plays a supporting and coordinating role between the players of the ecosystem. It is the lighthouse which helps keep the ecosystem oriented towards the North Star of that Purpose. **2020** Near\`s Protocol MainNet Genesis MAY 4, 2020 [https://near.org/blog/near-mainnet-genesis/](https://near.org/blog/near-mainnet-genesis/) **Transaction Data** There isn #8217;t any information about that since NEAR no has any listing exchange information. But there is the explorer [https://explorer.near.org/](https://explorer.near.org/) **Governance Model** Governance defines how the protocol is updated ( #8220;Technical Governance #8221;) and how its resources are allocated ( #8220;Resource Governance #8221;). NEAR #8217;s governance defines a Reference Maintainer, which is an entity responsible for technical upgrades to the NEAR network. This entity has been selected to maintain the Reference Implementation and continue to suggest improvements on the specification. All major releases will be protected with community discussion and a veto process (a 2 week challenge period), while smaller bug fixes can be rolled out fast and delivered to node operators. Resources provided by the network itself to the Protocol Treasury are governed and distributed by the NEAR Foundation. This foundation operates independently and will provide structured and transparent funding for projects and activities that are deemed to be most helpful to the ongoing health of the protocol #8217;s ecosystem. This may include technical projects (like the Reference Maintainer) and nontechnical projects or initiatives that support the commons and the community at large. **Technical Solution** It is well-known that Ethereum, the most used general purpose blockchain at the time of this writing, can only process less than 20 transactions per second on the main chain. This limitation, coupled with the popularity of the network, leads to high gas prices (the cost of executing a transaction on the network) and long confirmation times; The latter approach, in which the work is split among all the participating nodes, is called sharding. This is how Ethereum Foundation currently plans to scale Ethereum. In Nightshade we model the system as a single blockchain, in which each block logically contains all the transactions for all the shards, and changes the whole state of all the shards. Physically, however, no participant downloads the full state or the full logical block. Instead, each participant of the network only maintains the state that corresponds to the shards that they validate transactions for, and the list of all the transactions in the block is split into physical chunks, one chunks per shard.  #8203; https://preview.redd.it/9yj5pnsmdxa51.jpg?width=985 amp;format=pjpg amp;auto=webp amp;s=26ecb2ec88f0705a827f50f079e585f9caab4238 **GitHub Activity** https://preview.redd.it/vv6aebrodxa51.jpg?width=1599 amp;format=pjpg amp;auto=webp amp;s=74c655856f893d068e794c7c7d8da9fa644f6a33 https://preview.redd.it/86isr68qdxa51.jpg?width=1172 amp;format=pjpg amp;auto=webp amp;s=22a28ae10434865c00988c71a05aa03219983577 **Community Situation** Telegram Community Channel 2996 members [https://t.me/cryptonear](https://t.me/cryptonear) Medium There are several writers, so i\`ts difficult to precise an exact amount of followers.

It is not listed on any exchange, so it has not been tested to market conditions. It is focused on the flexible development of Dapps with a developer-friendly approach, which in the long run may attract more speed in the development of the project. The most attractive aspect of the project lies in the possibility of attracting more new developers or developers from other companies related to blockchain technology. Recently in May they partnered with the University of Washington to hold a Hackathon and collaborated as sponsors for the Future of Blockchain that is a long-form competition for those at the Universities of Cambridge, Oxford, London, Berlin and others to build a blockchain project over 3 months.

    <TITLE>Braving the Wind and the Waves, DeFi Earns GNO Great Fame Overnight</TITLE>
    <DATE>2020-07-17 07:06:32</DATE>
    <TEXT>*Written by the CoinEx Institution, this series of jocular and easy to understand articles will show you everything you need to know about major cryptocurrencies, making you fully prepared before jumping into crypto!* 2020 is destined to be an unusual year. It has witnessed the outbreak of Covid-19 all over the world and the economic crisis in many countries. The financial markets have plunged into a gloom, especially the market in the US where trading was temporarily halted five times in a row, an incident rare to even Warren Buffet, the godfather of American stock market. The cryptocurrency world has not been spared as many blockchain companies failed to survive because of the broken capital chain, causing a domino effect; investors in this world even started to hold negative towards cryptocurrencies after the big crash on March 12, which even dissuaded many outsiders from getting in #8230; In a word, the first half of 2020 is really too hard! Many projects in the blockchain industry are struggling to survive, and those survivors deserve our praise. Among them is DeFi that was once popular. DeFi, developing at the critical time, is destined to ride the wind and waves this year, ushering in all opportunities and challenges. In fact, the crypto community has been concerned about DeFi since 2019. With its exploration of financial applications, DeFi has derived prediction markets, insurance, payment platforms, asset management, and identity information authentication from financial scenarios, in addition to stablecoins, borrowing and DEX. Today we are going to talk about the decentralized prediction market, part of DeFi #8217;s product matrix. It looks a bit high-end. After all, not everyone can handle its slogan,  #8220;redistribute the future #8221;. There are two representative players in this market segment, the leader Augur and the latecomer Gnosis.  #8203; https://preview.redd.it/umpprozs9db51.jpg?width=512 amp;format=pjpg amp;auto=webp amp;s=d62eb4c4bdadd14a21d6e1f18c837076174644ce Gnosis means knowledge in Greek, also representing prophecy. The project deserves its name, which is to predict the future. Gnosis is a decentralized prediction market built on the Ethereum protocol; like Augur, it is one of the most compelling projects in the Ethereum ecosystem. Gnosis provides an open platform for people to predict the outcome of any event, which greatly simplifies the creation of customized prediction market applications and lowers the threshold for users. Its development can be traced back to the early days of the establishment of Ethereum. The team is led by Martin Koppelmann and Stefan George, experts in the prediction market, and an extraordinary advisory team represented by Vitalik Buterin, the Ethereum founder, and Joe Lubin, founder of ConsenSys. After 2 years of uninterrupted research and development, Gnosis has brought together the latest blockchain technologies such as Oracle, State Channels, and Futarchy. Its  #8220;Crowdsourced Wisdom #8221; platform allows anyone to predict the market at any time, and those with accurate prediction can receive rewards. (PS: The age of the prophet is coming!) In addition, Gnosis has also opened its own platform to create Dapp (decentralized applications). By the way the beta version of Gnosis is one of the first Dapps based on Ethereum and was released in August 2015. In April 2017, Gnosis issued its token, GNO. Unlike the traditional way of token sale, the Gnosis team chose an improved Dutch auction: 10 million GNOs as planned, up to 9 million GNOs will be sold through auctions, and the remaining tokens belong to the team. In the improved Dutch auction as aforementioned, the bidding price of the auction target decreases in sequence until the auction termination condition is triggered. Contrary to the case in current mainstream token crowdfunding pricing methods, the price of GNO will be lowered for each new block. During the auction, participants can send ETH to the token address released by the official, promising to purchase GNO at or below the current price upon submission. When the auction termination condition is triggered (i.e. where ETH in the equivalent of 12.5 million US dollars is raised or 9 million GNOs sold), the final GNO price on the block will be determined as the GNO auction price. Under this mechanism, all participants in a successful bidding have the same cost of obtaining each GNO, and the final auction price of the GNO will not be higher than the price promised by the participants in the bidding. In fact, the Gnosis ecosystem consists of two tokens: GNO and OWL. GNO is a local token in the Gnosis system. Its main purpose is to generate OWL  #8212; users can obtain OWL by locking the GNO in a smart contract. Some people claim that Gnosis has innovated in its effort to emulate Augur and even excelled the latter by virtue of the introduction of Oracle, which improves efficiency and expands the scope of use: 1. Gnosis provides an open platform for people to predict the outcome of any event. At the same time, the automatic execution of Oracle and the smart contract enables players to enter the prediction market more flexibly and freely, which not only simplifies the creation of customized prediction market applications but makes it even more efficient; 2. Oracle and smart contracts can automatically execute the prediction market, bringing it a grander vision that Gnosis participants may be no longer individuals; in the Internet of Things, the information collected by sensors can also enter into the blockchain as an information asset for prediction through Oracle, further expanding its scope of use. With the popularity of DeFi, GNO rose to fame overnight. According to the data shown on feixiaohao.com, GNO rose 94.56% this April, its community has also gained growing attention, and followers on Twitter and Reddit have surged in a month. Just like LBC, an obscure cryptocurrency that suddenly went viral, GNO deserves its fame on the one hand, and, on the other, it happened with a help of DeFi.  #8203; [ ](https://preview.redd.it/ef7uuugw9db51.jpg?width=1066 amp;format=pjpg amp;auto=webp amp;s=6390c8e172b8a4e33b83ab05bd47e36533f00456) At present, GNO has been listed in the new first-tier exchange CoinEx, providing users with more trading options for DeFi-related projects. As DeFi braves the wind and waves, how will GNO seize this opportunity? Will its trading volume and popularity continue to rise?

    <TITLE>Introduction to Cryptocurrencies: LBRY (LBC), the YouTube in the Blockchain</TITLE>
    <DATE>2020-07-24 07:20:39</DATE>
    <TEXT>*Written by the CoinEx Institution, this series of jocular and easy to understand articles will show you everything you need to know about major cryptocurrencies, making you fully prepared before jumping into crypto!* https://preview.redd.it/upvww1z8arc51.jpg?width=1024 amp;format=pjpg amp;auto=webp amp;s=60cca633d01cf14c82d4aef0ab2ab777af64471a LBC, born in 2016, has remained low-key or even obscure until the first half of 2020. It is just like an actor, being unknown in his 20s, yet rose to fame overnight in his 30s or 40s. Many people does not follow or even know such a niche cryptocurrency. Some people have spoken highly of it: LBC heralds an era of  #8220;Appcoins #8221;. What on earth makes it a hit and its value skyrocket this year? Today let #8217;s get to know LBC, the YouTube in the blockchain.  #8203; https://preview.redd.it/c0t7g01carc51.png?width=300 amp;format=png amp;auto=webp amp;s=0c8c841f00701f11ab19557f1900c6d9f917a4d2 Before we start, let #8217;s first take a look at LBRY, a content-sharing platform which displays works of some artists, producers, and writers. Creators can also get some income from their works displayed on this platform. (PS: Users can not only upload their videos without restrictions, but also synchronize their videos on YouTube directly to LBRY) https://preview.redd.it/qlxxhflmarc51.jpg?width=700 amp;format=pjpg amp;auto=webp amp;s=d43bc1f98db95c780d6d840fe18aaf80232acfcb You may ask: What makes LBRY different from YouTube? What does it have to do with the blockchain? Answers to these questions reveal the charm of LBRY. LBRY is a decentralized digital content center based on blockchain technology. It is also the first fully encrypted platform dedicated to publishing open source contents on the blockchain. Users can publish their works without the middleman, and directly contact consumers (with no middleman earning the margin). Moreover, its built-in credit system will also allow them to gain profits through their works. More and more content platforms are now focusing on such issues as content copyright and privacy, and there also emerges the demand for creators to get digital currency rewards on the platform. LBRY provides its solutions to these problems: 1. Creators can not only share their works at any time, but also receive corresponding LBC rewards depending on how popular their works are; 2. LBRY uses blockchain technology to provide creators with the ability to individually control their content. It does not have any  #8220;administrator #8221; or even the ability to delete the publisher #8217;s contents on the platform, which also largely solves problems such as copyright and plagiarism. According to LBRY, its goal is to provide users and content creators with control by means of blockchain technology. Compared with YouTube with a tight grip on contents, LBRY is a completely open platform where all users can participate in its network construction and all codes are open source; it offers creators more freedom of speech so that they may enjoy the charm of decentralized autonomy of blockchain technology. That is also encapsulated in the slogan on LBRY #8217;s official website: It #8217;s time to take back control from YouTube and Amazon. https://preview.redd.it/fihawafqarc51.jpg?width=700 amp;format=pjpg amp;auto=webp amp;s=fdfca74f79e7f2633367cd80f49ff748fc3817f0 Simply put, we can consider LBRY as a decentralized version of the YouTube and Amazon integration. As the token of LBRY, LBC (LBRY Credits) came with a mission to support LBRY #8217;s digital content market. Through LBC, creators can exchange the value of their works, traffic and the platform. Users or consumers can tip creators for their works (including videos and music) with LBC, and creators can also get LBC as rewards through their works. Jeremy Kauffman, the founder of LBRY, originally aspired to create a platform where people across the world could share their works. He is also a long-term supporter of decentralized technology and free speech. Since its launch in June 2016, LBRY has released more than 3.3 million pieces of digital contents. On this platform, millions of users access, download and upload various types of contents every month. LBRY #8217;s foreign communities also have considerable followers: 47,000 followers on Twitter and 23,000 followers on Facebook. Yet the LBRY team did not conduct an ICO and has raised only 500,000 USD in the seed round since 2016. Despite that, the team has been efficient in development and release of new versions. Its desktop-based, web-based, and mobile products have all been launched, and various new contents are published on the platform every day. That is not easy, considering all of its achievements. No wonder there is a saying that  #8220;LBRY heralds the era of Appcoins. #8221; By the way, here are some details about the distribution of LBC tokens - Organizations, charities and other strategic partners: 10% Airdrop: 20% Team operation: 10% Mining: 60% There is a total amount of 1 billion LBC, including 428 million LBC in circulation. With the POW composite algorithm, it takes 2.5 minutes to generate a block. **LBC has been listed on CoinEx, a first-tier exchange in China, and ViaBTC, a mining pool.** How will LBC develop after it returned to the public attention this year? Let #8217;s wait and see. # About CoinEx As a global and professional cryptocurrency exchange service provider, CoinEx was founded in December 2017 with Bitmain-led investment and has obtained a legal license in Estonia.

    <TITLE>The best DApps, which will likely lead the next phase.</TITLE>
    <DATE>2020-07-24 08:13:56</DATE>
    <TEXT>*Author: Gamals Ahmed, Business Ambassador*  #8203; [ https:\/\/images.app.goo.gl\/2c9rF5ZqfbjBzb2x6 ](https://preview.redd.it/85ji72t3jrc51.jpg?width=600 amp;format=pjpg amp;auto=webp amp;s=e6ae24a0e2863de393adb7130dd132077d1d2e29) One of the key themes in 2020 is the rise of decentralized financing (DeFi), a new type of financing that works on decentralized protocols and without the need for financial intermediaries. Lately, the number of DeFi apps has increased significantly, but many have not been seen or heard by many of us. In this Article I will be building a list of the best DApps, which will likely lead the next phase. DeFi apps can be categorized into different subcategories such as: * Finance * Exchange * Insurance * Gambling * Social And much more #8230; Note: Some of the projects in the report categorized into more than one section in the types of dApps. The rise of DeFi Bitcoin (BTC) was the first implementation of decentralized financing. It enabled individuals to conduct financial transactions with other individuals without the need for a financial intermediary in the digital age. Bitcoin and similar cryptocurrencies were the first wave of DeFi. The second wave of DeFi was enabled by Ethereum blockchain which added another layer of programmability to the blockchain. Now, at the beginning of 2020, individuals and companies can borrow, lend, trade, invest, exchange and store crypto assets in an unreliable way. In 2020, we can expect the amount of money held in lending protocols to increase as long-term investors diversify into interest-bearing offers, especially if the market fails to rise towards the 2017/18 highs. On the other hand, active crypto traders are becoming increasingly interested in decentralized trading offers. The increasing level of money security offered by decentralized trading platforms should not only see an increase in trading of DApp users, but also in the number of non-custodial trading and exchange platforms available. Lending: DeFi allows anyone to obtain or provide a loan without third party approval. The vast majority of lending products use common cryptocurrencies such as Ether ($ ETH) to secure outstanding loans through over-collateral. Thanks to the emergence of smart contracts, maintenance margins and interest rates can be programmed directly into a borrowing agreement with liquidations occurring automatically if the account balance falls below the specified collateral. The relative benefit gained from supplying different cryptocurrencies is different for the asset and the underlying platform used. # Compound [ Source: https:\/\/images.app.goo.gl\/SGttwo4JWadHTxYe7 ](https://preview.redd.it/ggr096s7jrc51.jpg?width=1148 amp;format=pjpg amp;auto=webp amp;s=b68b350786ec76e795d6a31c690534bd06178739) Compound is a money market protocol on the Ethereum blockchain  #8212; allowing individuals, institutions, and applications to frictionlessly earn interest on or borrow cryptographic assets without having to negotiate with a counterparty or peer. Each market has a dynamic borrowing interest rate, which floats in real-time as market conditions adjust. Compound focuses on allowing borrowers to take out loans and lenders to provide loans by locking their crypto assets into the protocol. The interest rates paid and received by borrowers and lenders are determined by the supply and demand of each crypto asset. Interest rates are generated with every block mined. Loans can be paid back and locked assets can be withdrawn at any time. While DeFi may seem overwhelming complex to the average individual, Compound prides itself on building a product that is digestible for users of all backgrounds. Compound is a protocol on the Ethereum blockchain that establishes money markets, which are pools of assets with algorithmically derived interest rates, based on the supply and demand for the asset. Suppliers (and borrowers) of an asset interact directly with the protocol, earning (and paying) a floating interest rate, without having to negotiate terms such as maturity, interest rate, or collateral with a peer or counterparty. Built on top of that principle is cTokens, Compound #8217;s native token that allows users to earn interest on their money while also being able to transfer, trade, and use that money in other applications. OVERVIEW ABOUT COMPOUND PROTOCOL Compound Finance is a San Francisco based company, which raised an $8.2 M seed round in May of 2018, and a $25M Series A round in November of 2019. Financing rounds were lead by industry giants including but not limited to Andressen Horowitz, Polychain Capital, Coinbase Ventures and Bain Capital Ventures, Compound Finance is a sector-leading lending protocol enabling users to lend and borrow popular cryptocurrencies like Ether, Dai and Tether. Compound leverages audited smart contracts responsible for the storage, management, and facilitation of all pooled capital. Users connect to Compound through web3 wallets like MetaMask with all positions being tracked using interest-earning tokens called cTokens. Compound recently introduced a governance token  #8212; COMP. It holds no economic benefits and is solely used to vote on protocol proposals. The distribution of COMP has absolutely exceeded expectations on all fronts. Compound is now the leading DeFi protocol both in terms of Total Value Locked and in terms of COMP #8217;s marketcap relative to other DeFi tokens. COMP was recently listed on Coinbase  #8212; the leading US cryptocurrency exchange and has seen strong interest from dozens of other exchanges including futures platforms like FTX. Compound #8217;s new governance system is well underway, with close to close to 10 proposals being passed since it #8217;s launch. What #8217;s unique about COMP #8217;s governance model is that tokenholders can delegate their tokens to an address of their choice. Only those who hold more than 1% of the supply can make new proposals. Besides earning interest on your crypto assets, which is a straightforward process of depositing crypto assets on the platform and receiving cTokens, you can also borrow crypto on Compound. Borrowing crypto assets has the added step of making sure the value of your collateral stays above a minimum amount relative to your loan. Compound and DeFi more broadly wants to help people have more access and control over the money they earn and save. While the project has had its criticisms, the long-term goal of Compound has always been to become fully decentralized over time. The Compound team currently manages the protocol, but they plan to eventually transfer all authority over to a Decentralized Autonomous Organization (DAO) governed by the Compound community. For following the project: **Website:** [https://compound.finance/](https://compound.finance/) **Medium:** [https://medium.com/compound-finance](https://medium.com/compound-finance) **Github:** [https://github.com/compound-finance/compound-protocol](https://github.com/compound-finance/compound-protocol) **DEXs:** Decentralized exchanges allow users to switch their assets without the need to transfer custody of basic collateral. DEXs aim to provide unreliable and interoperable trading across a wide range of trading pairs. # Kyber  #8203; [ Source: https:\/\/images.app.goo.gl\/sFCUhrgVwvs9ZJEP6 ](https://preview.redd.it/8y4dgg1ojrc51.jpg?width=308 amp;format=pjpg amp;auto=webp amp;s=9d3a1399a9a1ae9a20463758c5551c943e7952f1) Kyber is a blockchain-based liquidity protocol that allows decentralized token swaps to be integrated into any application, enabling value exchange to be performed seamlessly between all parties in the ecosystem. Using this protocol, developers can build innovative payment flows and applications, including instant token swap services, ERC20 payments, and financial DApps helping to build a world where any token is usable anywhere. Kyber #8217;s ecosystem is growing rapidly. In about a month, the team got an investment and partnered with some of the best projects. ParaFi Capital, a blockchain-focused investment company, has made a strategic purchase of KNC codes. The company will assist the DeFi project by qualifying new clients and improving professional market manufacture. The project #8217;s recent partnerships seem impressive. Includes Chainlink, Chicago DeFi Alliance, and Digifox Wallet. An important DeFi integration was also made with MakerDAO. KNC can now be used as a DAI warranty. The project has reached a milestone worth $ 1 billion of total turnover since its inception. More importantly, volume on an annual basis is moving and accelerating from $ 70 million in the first year to more than $ 600 million in 2020. Recently five million KNC (about 2.4% of total supply) were burned, improving Kyber #8217;s supply and demand ratio. In July, the Kyber network witnessed a Katalyst upgrade that will improve governance, signature, delegation and structural improvements. When Katalyst hits the main network, users will be able to either vote directly or delegate tokens to shareholder groups led by either companies like Stake Capital or community members. The KNC used to vote is burned, and in turn, voters get ETH as a reward. This setting creates a model for staking an uncommon contraction for the Kyber network. KyberDAO will facilitate chain governance, like many other projects based on Ethereum. An interesting partnership with xToken has been set up to help less-participating users stake out via xKNC. xKNC automatically makes specific voting decisions, making it easier for users to join and enjoy the return. The pool was created to draw BTC to Curve. Users who do this are eligible for returns in SNX, REN, CRV, and BAL. The more BTC lock on Synthetix, the more liquid it becomes, and the more attractive it is for traders. The project plans to continue expanding its products and move towards more decentralization. Synthetix futures are scheduled to appear on the exchange within a few months. The initial leverage is expected to be 10 to 20 times. The team aims to neglect its central oracle and replace it with one from Chainlink during the second stage of the migration. This will significantly increase the decentralization and flexibility of the platform. For following the project: **Website:** [https://kyber.network/](https://kyber.network/) **Medium:** [https://blog.kyber.network/](https://blog.kyber.network/) **Github:** [https://github.com/kybernetwork](https://github.com/kybernetwork) **Derivatives:** In traditional finance, a derivative represents a contract where the value is derived from an agreement based on the performance of an underlying asset. There are four main types of derivative contracts: futures, forwards, options, and swaps. # Synthetix [ Source: https:\/\/images.app.goo.gl\/1UsxQ7a3M5veb5sC7 ](https://preview.redd.it/goxeythtjrc51.jpg?width=1200 amp;format=pjpg amp;auto=webp amp;s=d4b891f8a80584aaa5e7ad2149947d29cd647247) Synthetix is a decentralized artificial asset issuance protocol based on Ethereum. These synthetic assets are guaranteed by the Synthetix Network (SNX) code which enables, upon conclusion of the contract, the release of Synths. This combined collateral model allows users to make transfers between Compound directly with the smart contract, avoiding the need for counterparties. This mechanism solves DEX #8217;s liquidity and sliding issues. Synthetix currently supports artificial banknotes, cryptocurrencies (long and short) and commodities. SNX holders are encouraged to share their tokens as part of their proportionate percentage of activity fees are paid on Synthetix.Exchange, based on their contribution to the network. It contains three DApp applications for trading, signature and analysis: Exchange (Synths at no cost). Mintr (SNX lock for tuning and fee collection). Synthetix Network Token is a great platform in the ethereum ecosystem that leverages blockchain technology to help bridge the gap between the often mysterious cryptocurrency world and the more realistic world of traditional assets. That is, on the Synthetix network, there are Synths, which are artificial assets that provide exposure to assets such as gold, bitcoin, US dollars, and various stocks such as Tesla (NASDAQ: TSLA) and Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL). The whole idea of these artificial assets is to create shared assets where users benefit from exposure to the assets, without actually owning the asset. It is a very unique idea, and a promising project in the ethereum landscape. Since it helps bridge the gap between cryptocurrencies and traditional assets, it creates a level of familiarity and value that is often lost in the assets of other digital currencies. This will make Synthetix take his seat in the next stage. On June 15, BitGo announced support for SNX and on June 19, Synthetix announced via blog post that Synthetix, Curve, and Ren  #8220;collaborated to launch a new stimulus group to provide liquidity for premium bitcoin on Ethereum #8221;, and said the goal was to  #8220;create the most liquid Ethereum  #8212; the BTC-based suite available to provide traders with the lowest slippage #8221; In trade between sBTC, renBTC and WBTC.  #8220; For following the project: **Website:** [https://www.synthetix.io/](https://www.synthetix.io/) **Blog:** [https://blog.synthetix.io/](https://blog.synthetix.io/) **Github:** [https://github.com/Synthetixio](https://github.com/Synthetixio) **Wallets:** Wallets are a crucial gateway for interacting with DeFi products. While they commonly vary in their underlying product and asset support, across the board we #8217;ve seen drastic improvements in usability and access thanks to the growing DeFi narrative. # Argent  #8203; [ Source: https:\/\/images.app.goo.gl\/mYPaWecFfwRqnUTx6 ](https://preview.redd.it/xczj4drwjrc51.jpg?width=1021 amp;format=pjpg amp;auto=webp amp;s=6d317c96206e24100e91d9abe6c91d7a868ae0f9) It is the startup for consumer game-changing financial technology, which makes decentralized web access safer and easier. The company has built a smart and easy-to-use mobile wallet for Ethereum, which gives users the ability to easily retrieve their encrypted currencies on the go. **Argent Benefits:** * Only you control your assets * Explore DeFi with one click * Easily retrieve and close your wallet * The wallet pays gas for in-app features, for example Compound and Maker The Argent crypto wallet simplifies the process without sacrificing security. It is a type of wallet that allows you to keep cryptographic keys while keeping things simple. The Argent wallet is secured by something called the Guardians. If you lose your phone (and your Argent wallet), just contact your guardians to confirm your identity. Then you can get all your money back on another device. It is a simple and intuitive method that can make cryptocurrency manipulation easier to do without experience. Argent is focused on the Ethereum blockchain and plans to support everything Ethereum has to offer. Of course, you can send and receive ETH. The startup wants to hide the complexity on this front, as it covers transaction fees (gas) for you and gives you usernames. This way, you don #8217;t have to set a transaction fee to make sure it expires. Insurance cooperative Nexus Mutual and Argent Portfolio Provider are planning to offer a range of smart and insurance contracts to keep Argent user money safe from hackers. First, the smart contract is designed to prevent thieves from draining the wallet by temporarily freezing transfers above the daily spending limit for addresses not listed in the user #8217;s whitelist. The user has 24 hours to cancel the frozen transfer  #8212; very similar to the bank #8217;s intervention and prevent fraud on the card or similar suspicious activities in the account. By contrast, the default coding state is closer to criticism: once it disappears, it disappears.  #8220;We are thinking not only of crypto users but also new users  #8212; so the ultimate goal is to duplicate what they get from their bank, #8221; said Itamar Lisuis, one of the founders of Argent. For following the project: **Website:** [https://www.argent.xyz/](https://www.argent.xyz/) **Medium:** [https://medium.com/argenthq](https://medium.com/argenthq) **Github:** [https://github.com/argentlabs/](https://github.com/argentlabs/) **Asset Management:** With such a vast amount of DeFi products, it #8217;s crucial that tools are in place to better track and manage assets. In line with the permissionless nature of the wider DeFi ecosystem, these assets management projects provide users with the ability to seamlessly track their balances across various tokens, products and services in an intuitive fashion. # InstaDapp [ Source: https:\/\/images.app.goo.gl\/VP9Xwih6VQ1Zmv2E9 ](https://preview.redd.it/ig30a7w0krc51.jpg?width=300 amp;format=pjpg amp;auto=webp amp;s=b85993a8b34e067c15916730d571f9767e9b697c) It is a smart wallet for DeFi that allows users to seamlessly manage multiple DeFi applications to maximize returns across different protocols in a fraction of the time. With InstaDapp, users can take advantage of industry-leading projects like Compound, MakerDAO and Uniswap in one easy-to-use portal. Instadapp currently supports dapps MakerDAO and Compound DeFi, allowing users to add collateral, borrow, redeem and redeem their collateral on each dapp, as well as refinance debt positions between the two. In addition to its ease of use, InstaDapp also adds additional benefits and use cases for supported projects that are not already supported. The project focuses on making DeFi easier for non-technical users by maintaining a decentralized spirit while stripping many of the confusing terms that many products bring with them. InstaDapp has launched a one-click and one-transaction solution that allows users to quadruple the COMP Codes they can earn from using quadruple borrowing and lending. A good timing feature for sure, but this kind of simplification is exactly why Instadapp was created. Its goal is to create a simple interface into multiple DeFi applications running on the Ethereum Blockchain and then automate complex interactions in a way that enables users to maximize their profits while reducing transactions and Ethereum gas charges. To use Instadapp you will need Ethereum wallet and you will also have to create what is called Instadapp smart wallet in which token you want to use. For following the project: **Website:** [https://instadapp.io/](https://instadapp.io/) **Medium:** [https://medium.com/instadapp](https://medium.com/instadapp) **Github:** [https://github.com/instadapp](https://github.com/instadapp) **Savings:** There are a select few DeFi projects which offer unique and novel ways to earn a return by saving cryptocurrencies. This differs from lending as there is no borrower on the other side of the table. # Dharma [ Source: https:\/\/images.app.goo.gl\/4JhfFNxPfE9oxoqV6 ](https://preview.redd.it/lrk1yer3krc51.jpg?width=929 amp;format=pjpg amp;auto=webp amp;s=82966025b8767badb85d432accfea125d38e8aaf) Dharma is an easy-to-use layer above the compound protocol. It introduces new and non-technical users to transaction encryption and allows them to easily borrow or lend in DeFi markets and earn interest in stable currencies. You can start by simply using a debit card. Funds are kept in a non-portfolio portfolio, which constantly earns interest on all of your deposited assets. The value of Dharma #8217;s DeFi lending experience is: * Easy entry. * Simple wallet. * High protection. * Depositing and withdrawing banknotes. Dharma, the prominent DeFi cryptobank bank, has made it extremely easy to bring any Twitter user into the crypto world. Dharma users can send money from the Dharma app by searching for any Twitter handle, setting the required amount, and clicking on one button. The Twitter Dharma Bot account can send a unique notification with a link to download the Dharma mobile app. Senders are encouraged to retweet the notification to ensure that the receiver does not lose it. To raise money, recipients simply download the Dharma app. After creating a Dharma account, users connect their Twitter account to receive access to the money sent. They can choose to transfer money to US dollars and withdraw to a bank account, or leave DAI in a Dharma account where it will earn interest like all Dharma deposits. The submitted DAI will gain interest even before the receiving user requests it while waiting for the claim. In her ad, Dharma demonstrated a number of ways in which the new social payments feature can be used, including tips for your favorite Twitter personalities, accepting payments for goods or services in a very clear way, charitable donations across borders or transfer payments. The Dharma app is available for both Android and iOS. Dharma and Compound Dharma generates interest by DAI signing the Compound Protocol. Dharma also appeared in the news recently after the release of a specification outlining a Layer 2 expansion solution allowing the platform to expand to handle current transaction volume 10x, ensuring users can transfer their money quickly even in times of heavy congestion on the Ethereum network. Dharma is developing its  #8220;core #8221; and  #8220;underwriting #8221; contracts within the company. Underwriting contracts are open source and non-custodian, while each loan contract is closed source. This means that the receiving address contains nodes that interact with a script on a central Dharma server.For following the project: **Website:** [https://dharma.io/](https://dharma.io/) **Medium:** [https://medium.com/dharma-blog](https://medium.com/dharma-blog) **Github:** [https://github.com/dharmaprotocol](https://github.com/dharmaprotocol) **Insurance:** Decentralized insurance protocols allow users to take out policies on smart contracts, funds, or any other cryptocurrencies through pooled funds and reserves. # Nexus Mutual  #8203; [ Source: https:\/\/images.app.goo.gl\/b7HwB8ifvTXwFhrh6 ](https://preview.redd.it/n3y0lzi7krc51.jpg?width=1000 amp;format=pjpg amp;auto=webp amp;s=c134eb798cfb3dd146df95a06c55f58e4e4b50a6) Nexus Mutual uses blockchain technology to return mutual values to insurance by creating consistent incentives with the smart contract symbol on the Ethereum blockchain. It is built on the Ethchaum blockchain and uses a modular system to aggregate smart Ethereum nodes, allowing to upgrade the system #8217;s logical components without affecting other components. The way Nexus works is members of the mutual association by purchasing NXM codes that allow them to participate in the decentralized independent organization (DAO). All decisions are voted on by members, who are motivated to pay real claims. It sees plenty of opportunities in a gradual transition of Ethereum to Eth 2.0, which is expected to start later this year. Eth 2.0 moves the network from the power-hungry Proof-of-Consensus (PoW) algorithm to Proof-of-Stake (PoS), a way to sign cryptocurrency in order to keep the network afloat. Having a steady return on signature from the Ether (ETH) can be somewhat compared to the way in which insurance companies invest in the real world the premiums they collect. By setting a strong set of conditions for Nexus Mutual, anyone will be able to bring in and acquire a new form of risk for mutual coverage  #8212; assuming that members are willing to share NXM. With this design, the mutual discretion will be able to expand into much broader fields beyond smart contracts. In addition to defining multi-layered term agreements, Nexus Mutual also has some other advantages needed to achieve this visualization.

    <TEXT>*Author: Gamals Ahmed, CoinEx Business Ambassador* **ABSTRACT** The DFINITY blockchain computer provides a secure, performant and flexible consensus mechanism. At its core, DFINITY contains a decentralized randomness beacon, which acts as a verifiable random function (VRF) that produces a stream of outputs over time. The novel technique behind the beacon relies on the existence of a unique-deterministic, non-interactive, DKG-friendly threshold signatures scheme. The only known examples of such a scheme are pairing-based and derived from BLS. The DFINITY blockchain is layered on top of the DFINITY beacon and uses the beacon as its source of randomness for leader selection and leader ranking. A  #8220;weight #8221; is attributed to a chain based on the ranks of the leaders who propose the blocks in the chain, and that weight is used to select between competing chains. The DFINITY blockchain is layered on top of the DFINITY beacon and uses the beacon as its source of randomness for leader selection and leader ranking blockchain is further hardened by a notarization process which dramatically improves the time to finality and eliminates the nothing-at-stake and selfish mining attacks. DFINITY consensus algorithm is made to scale through continuous quorum selections driven by the random beacon. In practice, DFINITY achieves block times of a few seconds and transaction finality after only two confirmations. The system gracefully handles temporary losses of network synchrony including network splits, while it is provably secure under synchrony. # 1.INTRODUCTION DFINITY is building a new kind of public decentralized cloud computing resource. The company #8217;s platform uses blockchain technology which is aimed at building a new kind of public decentralized cloud computing resource with unlimited capacity, performance and algorithmic governance shared by the world, with the capability to power autonomous self-updating software systems, enabling organizations to design and deploy custom-tailored cloud computing projects, thereby reducing enterprise IT system costs by 90%. DFINITY aims to explore new territory and prove that the blockchain opportunity is far broader and deeper than anyone has hitherto realized, unlocking the opportunity with powerful new crypto. Although a standalone project, DFINITY is not maximalist minded and is a great supporter of Ethereum. The DFINITY blockchain computer provides a secure, performant and flexible consensus mechanism. At its core, DFINITY contains a decentralized randomness beacon, which acts as a verifiable random function (VRF) that produces a stream of outputs over time. The novel technique behind the beacon relies on the existence of a unique-deterministic, non-interactive, DKG-friendly threshold signatures scheme. The only known examples of such a scheme are pairing-based and derived from BLS. DFINITY #8217;s consensus mechanism has four layers: notary (provides fast finality guarantees to clients and external observers), blockchain (builds a blockchain from validated transactions via the Probabilistic Slot Protocol driven by the random beacon), random beacon (provides the source of randomness for all higher layers like smart contract applications), and identity (provides a registry of all clients). **DFINITY #8217;s consensus mechanism has four layers**  #8203; [ Figure1: DFINITY #8217;s consensus mechanism layers ](https://preview.redd.it/er6w1r3805e51.jpg?width=437 amp;format=pjpg amp;auto=webp amp;s=17c5b7096d3ad2c384d52114b6e2049dad26c395) **1. Identity layer:** Active participants in the DFINITY Network are called clients. Where clients are registered with permanent identities under a pseudonym. Moreover, DFINITY supports open membership by providing a protocol for registering new clients by depositing a stake with an insurance period. This is the responsibility of the first layer. **2. Random Beacon layer:** Provides the source of randomness (VRF) for all higher layers including ap- plications (smart contracts). The random beacon in the second layer is an unbiasable, verifiable random function (VRF) that is produced jointly by registered clients. Each random output of the VRF is unpredictable by anyone until just before it becomes avail- able to everyone. This is a key technology of the DFINITY system, which relies on a threshold signature scheme with the properties of uniqueness and non-interactivity.  #8203; https://preview.redd.it/hkcf53ic05e51.jpg?width=441 amp;format=pjpg amp;auto=webp amp;s=44d45c9602ee630705ce92902b8a8379201d8111 **3. Blockchain layer:** The third layer deploys the  #8220;probabilistic slot protocol #8221; (PSP). This protocol ranks the clients for each height of the chain, in an order that is derived determin- istically from the unbiased output of the random beacon for that height. A weight is then assigned to block proposals based on the proposer #8217;s rank such that blocks from clients at the top of the list receive a higher weight. Forks are resolved by giving favor to the  #8220;heaviest #8221; chain in terms of accumulated block weight  #8212; quite sim- ilar to how traditional proof-of-work consensus is based on the highest accumulated amount of work. **The first advantage** of the PSP protocol is that the ranking is available instantaneously, which allows for a predictable, constant block time. **The second advantage** is that there is always a single highest-ranked client, which allows for a homogenous network bandwidth utilization. Instead, a race between clients would favor a usage in bursts. **4. Notarization layer:** Provides fast finality guarantees to clients and external observers. DFINITY deploys the novel technique of block notarization in its fourth layer to speed up finality. A notarization is a threshold signature under a block created jointly by registered clients. Only notarized blocks can be included in a chain. Of all RSA-based alternatives exist but suffer from an impracticality of setting up the thresh- old keys without a trusted dealer. DFINITY achieves its high speed and short block times exactly because notarization is not full consensus. DFINITY does not suffer from selfish mining attack or a problem nothing at stake because the authentication step is impossible for the opponent to build and maintain a series of linked and trusted blocks in secret. DFINITY #8217;s consensus is designed to operate on a network of millions of clients. To en- able scalability to this extent, the random beacon and notarization protocols are designed such as that they can be safely and efficiently delegated to a committee ## 1.1 OVERVIEW ABOUT DFINITY DFINITY is a blockchain-based cloud-computing project that aims to develop an open, public network, referred to as the  #8220;internet computer, #8221; to host the next generation of software and data. and it is a decentralized and non-proprietary network to run the next generation of mega-applications. It dubbed this public network  #8220;Cloud 3.0 #8221;. DFINITY is a third generation virtual blockchain network that sets out to function as an  #8220;intelligent decentralised cloud, #8221; #185; strongly focused on delivering a viable corporate cloud solution. The DFINITY project is overseen, supported and promoted by DFINITY Stiftung a not-for-profit foundation based in Zug, Switzerland. DFINITY is a decentralized network design whose protocols generate a reliable  #8220;virtual blockchain computer #8221; running on top of a peer-to-peer network upon which software can be installed and can operate in the tamperproof mode of smart contracts. DFINITY introduces algorithmic governance in the form of a  #8220;Blockchain Nervous System #8221; that can protect users from attacks and help restart broken systems, dynamically optimize network security and efficiency, upgrade the protocol and mitigate misuse of the platform, for example by those wishing to run illegal or immoral systems. DFINITY is an Ethereum-compatible smart contract platform that is implementing some revolutionary ideas to address blockchain performance, scaling, and governance. Whereas DFINITY could pose a credible threat to Ethereum #8217;s extinction, the project is pursuing a coevolutionary strategy by contributing funding and effort to Ethereum projects and freely offering their technology to Ethereum for adoption. DFINITY has labeled itself Ethereum #8217;s  #8220;crazy sister #8221; to express it #8217;s close genetic resemblance to Ethereum, differentiated by its obsession with performance and neuron-inspired governance model. Dfinity raised $61 million from Andreesen Horowitz and Polychain Capital in a February 2018 funding round. At the time, Dfinity said it wanted to create an  #8220;internet computer #8221; to cut the costs of running cloud-based business applications. A further $102 million funding round in August 2018 brought the project #8217;s total funding to $195 million. In May 2018, Dfinity announced plans to distribute around $35 million worth of Dfinity tokens in an airdrop. It was part of the company #8217;s plan to create a  #8220;Cloud 3.0. #8221; Because of regulatory concerns, none of the tokens went to US residents. DFINITY be broadening and strengthening the EVM ecosystem by giving applications a choice of platforms with different characteristics. However, if DFINITY succeeds in delivering a fully EVM-compatible smart contract platform with higher transaction throughput, faster confirmation times, and governance mechanisms that can resolve public disputes without causing community splits, then it will represent a clearly superior choice for deploying new applications and, as its network effects grow, an attractive place to bring existing ones. Of course the challenge for DFINITY will be to deliver on these promises while meeting the security demands of a public chain with significant value at risk. ## 1.1.1 DFINITY FUTURE * DFINITY aims to explore new blockchain territory related to the original goals of the Ethereum project and is sometimes considered  #8220;Ethereum #8217;s crazy sister. #8221; * DFINITY is developing blockchain-based infrastructure to support a new style of the internet (akin to Ethereum #8217;s  #8220;World Computer #8221;), one in which the internet itself will support software applications and data rather than various cloud hosting providers. * The project suggests this reinvented software platform can simplify the development of new software systems, reduce the human capital needed to maintain and secure data, and preserve user data privacy. * Dfinity aims to reduce the costs of cloud services by creating a decentralized  #8220;internet computer #8221; which may launch in 2020 * Dfinity claims transactions on its network are finalized in 3 #8211;5 seconds, compared to 1 hour for Bitcoin and 10 minutes for Ethereum. ## 1.1.2 DFINITY #8217;S VISION DFINITY #8217;s vision is its new internet infrastructure can support a wide variety of end-user and enterprise applications. Social media, messaging, search, storage, and peer-to-peer Internet interactions are all examples of functionalities that DFINITY plans to host atop its public Web 3.0 cloud-like computing resource. In order to provide the transaction and data capacity necessary to support this ambitious vision, DFINITY features a unique consensus model (dubbed Threshold Relay) and algorithmic governance via its Blockchain Nervous System (BNS)  #8212; sometimes also referred to as the Network Nervous System or NNS. ## 1.2 DFINITY COMMUNITY The DFINITY community brings people and organizations together to learn and collaborate on products that help steward the next-generation of internet software and services. The Internet Computer allows developers to take on the monopolization of the internet, and return the internet back to its free and open roots. We #8217;re committed to connecting those who believe the same through our events, content, and discussions.  #8203; https://preview.redd.it/0zv64fzf05e51.png?width=637 amp;format=png amp;auto=webp amp;s=e2b17365fae3c679a32431062d8e3c00a57673cf # 1.3 DFINITY ROADMAP (TIMELINE) February 15, 2017 **February 15, 2017** **Ethereum based community seed round raises 4M Swiss francs (CHF)** The DFINITY Stiftung, a not-for-profit foundation entity based in Zug, Switzerland, raised the round. The foundation held $10M of assets as of April 2017. **February 8, 2018** **Dfinity announces a $61M fundraising round led by Polychain Capital and Andreessen Horowitz** The round $61M round led by Polychain Capital and Andreessen Horowitz, along with an DFINITY Ecosystem Venture Fund which will be used to support projects developing on the DFINITY platform, and an Ethereum based raise in 2017 brings the total funding for the project over $100 million. This is the first cryptocurrency token that Andressen Horowitz has invested in, led by Chris Dixon. **August 2018** Dfinity raises a $102,000,000 venture round from Multicoin Capital, Village Global, Aspect Ventures, Andreessen Horowitz, Polychain Capital, Scalar Capital, Amino Capital and SV Angel. **January 23, 2020** Dfinity launches an open source platform aimed at the social networking giants # 2.DFINITY TECHNOLOGY Dfinity is building what it calls the internet computer, a decentralized technology spread across a network of independent data centers that allows software to run anywhere on the internet rather than in server farms that are increasingly controlled by large firms, such as Amazon Web Services or Google Cloud. This week Dfinity is releasing its software to third-party developers, who it hopes will start making the internet computer #8217;s killer apps. It is planning a public release later this year. At its core, the DFINITY consensus mechanism is a variation of the Proof of Stake (PoS) model, but offers an alternative to traditional Proof of Work (PoW) and delegated PoS (dPoS) networks. Threshold Relay intends to strike a balance between inefficiencies of decentralized PoW blockchains (generally characterized by slow block times) and the less robust game theory involved in vote delegation (as seen in dPoS blockchains). In DFINITY, a committee of  #8220;miners #8221; is randomly selected to add a new block to the chain. An individual miner #8217;s probability of being elected to the committee proposing and computing the next block (or blocks) is proportional to the number of dfinities the miner has staked on the network. Further, a  #8220;weight #8221; is attributed to a DFINITY chain based on the ranks of the miners who propose blocks in the chain, and that weight is used to choose between competing chains (i.e. resolve chain forks). A decentralized random beacon manages the random selection process of temporary block producers. This beacon is a Variable Random Function (VRF), which is a pseudo-random function that provides publicly verifiable proofs of its outputs #8217; correctness. A core component of the random beacon is the use of Boneh-Lynn-Shacham (BLS) signatures. By leveraging the BLS signature scheme, the DFINITY protocol ensures no actor in the network can determine the outcome of the next random assignment. Dfinity is introducing a new standard, which it calls the internet computer protocol (ICP). These new rules let developers move software around the internet as well as data. All software needs computers to run on, but with ICP the computers could be anywhere. Instead of running on a dedicated server in Google Cloud, for example, the software would have no fixed physical address, moving between servers owned by independent data centers around the world.  #8220;Conceptually, it #8217;s kind of running everywhere, #8221; says Dfinity engineering manager Stanley Jones. DFINITY also features a native programming language, called ActorScript (name may be subject to change), and a virtual machine for smart contract creation and execution. The new smart contract language is intended to simplify the management of application state for programmers via an orthogonal persistence environment (which means active programs are not required to retrieve or save their state). All ActorScript contracts are eventually compiled down to WebAssembly instructions so the DFINITY virtual machine layer can execute the logic of applications running on the network. The advantage of using the WebAssembly standard is that all major browsers support it and a variety of programming languages can compile down to Wasm (not just ActorScript). Dfinity is moving fast. Recently, Dfinity showed off a TikTok clone called CanCan. In January it demoed a LinkedIn-alike called LinkedUp. Neither app is being made public, but they make a convincing case that apps made for the internet computer can rival the real things. ## 2.1 DFINITY CORE APPLICATIONS **The DFINITY cloud has two core applications:** 1. **Enabling the re-engineering of business:** DFINITY ambitiously aims to facilitate the re-engineering of mass-market services (such as Web Search, Ridesharing Services, Messaging Services, Social Media, Supply Chain, etc) into open source businesses that leverage autonomous software and decentralised governance systems to operate and update themselves more efficiently. 2. **Enable the re-engineering of enterprise IT systems to reduce costs:** DFINITY seeks to re-engineer enterprise IT systems to take advantage of the unique properties that blockchain computer networks provide. At present, computation on blockchain-based computer networks is far more expensive than traditional, centralised solutions (Amazon Web Services, Microsoft Azure, Google Cloud Platform, etc). Despite increasing computational cost, DFINITY intends to lower net costs  #8220;by 90% or more #8221; through reducing the human capital cost associated with sustaining and supporting these services. Whilst conceptually similar to Ethereum, DFINITY employs original and new cryptography methods and protocols (crypto:3) at the network level, in concert with AI and network-fuelled systemic governance (Blockchain Nervous System  #8212; BNS) to facilitate Corporate adoption. DFINITY recognises that different users value different properties and sees itself as more of a fully compatible extension of the Ethereum ecosystem rather than a competitor of the Ethereum network. In the future, DFINITY hopes that much of their  #8220;new crypto might be used within the Ethereum network and are also working hard on shared technology components. #8221; As the DFINITY project develops over time, the DFINITY Stiftung foundation intends to steadily increase the BNS #8217; decision-making responsibilities over time, eventually resulting in the dissolution of its own involvement entirely, once the BNS is sufficiently sophisticated. DFINITY consensus mechanism is a heavily optimized proof of stake (PoS) model. It places a strong emphasis on transaction finality through implementing a Threshold Relay technique in conjunction with the BLS signature scheme and a notarization method to address many of the problems associated with PoS consensus. ## 2.2 THRESHOLD RELAY As a public cloud computing resource, DFINITY targets business applications by substantially reducing cloud computing costs for IT systems. They aim to achieve this with a highly scalable and powerful network with potentially unlimited capacity. The DFINITY platform is chalk full of innovative designs and features like their Blockchain Nervous System (BNS) for algorithmic governance. One of the primary components of the platform is its novel Threshold Relay Consensus model from which randomness is produced, driving the other systems that the network depends on to operate effectively. The consensus system was first designed for a permissioned participation model but can be paired with any method of Sybil resistance for an open participation model. ** #8220;The Threshold Relay is the mechanism by which Dfinity randomly samples replicas into groups, sets the groups (committees) up for threshold operation, chooses the current committee, and relays from one committee to the next is called the threshold relay. #8221;** ***Threshold Relay consists of four layers (As mentioned previously):*** 1. **Notary layer,** which provides fast finality guarantees to clients and external observers and eliminates nothing-at-stake and selfish mining attacks, providing Sybil attack resistance. 2. **Blockchain layer** that builds a blockchain from validated transactions via the Probabilistic Slot Protocol driven by the random beacon. 3. **Random beacon,** which as previously covered, provides the source of randomness for all higher layers like the blockchain layer smart contract applications. 4. **Identity layer** that provides a registry of all clients. ## 2.2.1 HOW DOES THRESHOLD RELAY WORK? Threshold Relay produces an endogenous random beacon, and each new value defines random group(s) of clients that may independently try and form into a  #8220;threshold group #8221;. The composition of each group is entirely random such that they can intersect and clients can be presented in multiple groups. In DFINITY, each group is comprised of 400 members. When a group is defined, the members attempt to set up a BLS threshold signature system using a distributed key generation protocol. If they are successful within some fixed number of blocks, they then register the public key ( #8220;identity #8221;) created for their group on the global blockchain using a special transaction, such that it will become part of the set of active groups in a following  #8220;epoch #8221;. The network begins at  #8220;genesis #8221; with some number of predefined groups, one of which is nominated to create a signature on some default value. Such signatures are random values  #8212; if they were not then the group #8217;s signatures on messages would be predictable and the threshold signature system insecure  #8212; and each random value produced thus is used to select a random successor group. This next group then signs the previous random value to produce a new random value and select another group, relaying between groups ad infinitum and producing a sequence of random values. In a cryptographic threshold signature system a group can produce a signature on a message upon the cooperation of some minimum threshold of its members, which is set to 51% in the DFINITY network. To produce the threshold signature, group members sign the message individually (here the preceding group #8217;s threshold signature) creating individual  #8220;signature shares #8221; that are then broadcast to other group members. The group threshold signature can be constructed upon combination of a sufficient threshold of signature shares. So for example, if the group size is 400, if the threshold is set at 201 any client that collects that many shares will be able to construct the group #8217;s signature on the message. Other group members can validate each signature share, and any client using the group #8217;s public key can validate the single group threshold signature produced by combining them. The magic of the BLS scheme is that it is  #8220;unique and deterministic #8221; meaning that from whatever subset of group members the required number of signature shares are collected, the single threshold signature created is always the same and only a single correct value is possible. Consequently, the sequence of random values produced is entirely deterministic and unmanipulable, and signatures generated by relaying between groups produces a Verifiable Random Function, or VRF. Although the sequence of random values is pre-determined given some set of participating groups, each new random value can only be produced upon the minimal agreement of a threshold of the current group. Conversely, in order for relaying to stall because a random number was not produced, the number of correct processes must be below the threshold. Thresholds are configured so that this is extremely unlikely. For example, if the group size is set to 400, and the threshold is 201, 200 or more of the processes must become faulty to prevent production. If there are 10,000 processes in the network, of which 3,000 are faulty, the probability this will occur is less than 10e-17. ## 2.3 DFINITY TOKEN The DFINITY blockchain also supports a native token, called dfinities (DFN), which perform multiple roles within the network, including: 1. Fuel for deploying and running smart contracts. 2. Security deposits (i.e. staking) that enable participation in the BNS governance system. 3. Security deposits that allow client software or private DFINITY cloud networks to connect to the public network. Although dfinities will end up being assigned a value by the market, the DFINITY team does not intend for DFN to act as a currency. Instead, the project has envisioned PHI, a  #8220;next-generation #8221; crypto-fiat scheme, to act as a stable medium of exchange within the DFINITY ecosystem. Neuron operators can earn Dfinities by participating in network-wide votes, which could be concerning protocol upgrades, a new economic policy, etc. DFN rewards for participating in the governance system are proportional to the number of tokens staked inside a neuron. ## 2.4 SCALABILITY DFINITY is constantly developing with a structure that separates consensus, validation, and storage into separate layers. The storage layer is divided into multiple strings, each of which is responsible for processing transactions that occur in the fragment state. The verification layer is responsible for combining hashes of all fragments in a Merkle-like structure that results in a global state fractionation that is stored in blocks in the top-level chain. ## 2.5 DFINITY CONSENSUS ALGORITHM The single most important aspect of the user experience is certainly the time required before a transaction becomes final. This is not solved by a short block time alone  #8212; Dfinity #8217;s team also had to reduce the number of confirmations required to a small constant. DFINITY moreover had to provide a provably secure proof-of-stake algorithm that scales to millions of active participants without compromising any bit on decentralization. Dfinity soon realized that the key to scalability lay in having an unmanipulable source of randomness available. Hence they built a scalable decentralized random beacon, based on what they call the Threshold Relay technique, right into the foundation of the protocol. This strong foundation drives a scalable and fast consensus layer: On top of the beacon runs a blockchain which utilizes notarization by threshold groups to achieve near-instant finality. Details can be found in the overview paper that we are releasing today. The roots of the DFINITY consensus mechanism date back to 2014 when thair Chief Scientist, Dominic Williams, started to look for more efficient ways to drive large consensus networks. Since then, much research has gone into the protocol and it took several iterations to reach its current design. For any practical consensus system the difficulty lies in navigating the tight terrain that one is given between the boundaries imposed by theoretical impossibility-results and practical performance limitations. The first key milestone was the novel Threshold Relay technique for decentralized, deterministic randomness, which is made possible by certain unique characteristics of the BLS signature system. The next breakthrough was the notarization technique, which allows DFINITY consensus to solve the traditional problems that come with proof-of-stake systems. Getting the security proofs sound was the final step before publication. DFINITY consensus has made the proper trade-offs between the practical side (realistic threat models and security assumptions) and the theoretical side (provable security). Out came a flexible, tunable algorithm, which we expect will establish itself as the best performing proof-of-stake algorithm. In particular, having the built-in random beacon will prove to be indispensable when building out sharding and scalable validation techniques. ## 2.6 LINKEDUP The startup has rather cheekily called this  #8220;an open version of LinkedIn, #8221; the Microsoft-owned social network for professionals. Unlike LinkedIn, LinkedUp, which runs on any browser, is not owned or controlled by a corporate entity. LinkedUp is built on Dfinity #8217;s so-called Internet Computer, its name for the platform it is building to distribute the next generation of software and open internet services. The software is hosted directly on the internet on a Switzerland-based independent data center, but in the concept of the Internet Computer, it could be hosted at your house or mine. The compute power to run the application LinkedUp, in this case  #8212; is coming not from Amazon AWS, Google Cloud or Microsoft Azure, but is instead based on the distributed architecture that Dfinity is building. Specifically, Dfinity notes that when enterprises and developers run their web apps and enterprise systems on the Internet Computer, the content is decentralized across a minimum of four or a maximum of an unlimited number of nodes in Dfinity #8217;s global network of independent data centers. Dfinity is an open source for LinkedUp to developers for creating other types of open internet services on the architecture it has built.  #8220;Open Social Network for Professional Profiles #8221; suggests that on Dfinity model one can create  #8220;Open WhatsApp #8221;,  #8220;Open eBay #8221;,  #8220;Open Salesforce #8221; or  #8220;Open Facebook #8221;. The tools include a Canister Software Developer Kit and a simple programming language called Motoko that is optimized for Dfinity #8217;s Internet Computer.  #8220;The Internet Computer is conceived as an alternative to the $3.8 trillion legacy IT stack, and empowers the next generation of developers to build a new breed of tamper-proof enterprise software systems and open internet services. We are democratizing software development, #8221; Williams said.  #8220;The Bronze release of the Internet Computer provides developers and enterprises a glimpse into the infinite possibilities of building on the Internet Computer  #8212; which also reflects the strength of the Dfinity team we have built so far. #8221; Dfinity says its  #8220;Internet Computer Protocol #8221; allows for a new type of software called autonomous software, which can guarantee permanent APIs that cannot be revoked. When all these open internet services (e.g. open versions of WhatsApp, Facebook, eBay, Salesforce, etc.) are combined with other open software and services it creates  #8220;mutual network effects #8221; where everyone benefits. On 1 November, DFINITY has released 13 new public versions of the SDK, to our second major milestone \[at WEF Davos\] of demoing a decentralized web app called LinkedUp on the Internet Computer. Subsequent milestones towards the public launch of the Internet Computer will involve: 1. On boarding a global network of independent data centers. 2. Fully tested economic system. 3. Fully tested Network Nervous Systems for configuration and upgrades ## 2.7 WHAT IS MOTOKO? Motoko is a new software language being developed by the DFINITY Foundation, with an accompanying SDK, that is designed to help the broadest possible audience of developers create reliable and maintainable websites, enterprise systems and internet services on the Internet Computer with ease. By developing the Motoko language, the DFINITY Foundation will ensure that a language that is highly optimized for the new environment is available. However, the Internet Computer can support any number of different software frameworks, and the DFINITY Foundation is also working on SDKs that support the Rust and C languages. Eventually, it is expected there will be many different SDKs that target the Internet Computer. [Full article](https://medium.com/@CoinExInstitution/dfinity-research-report-dfcff83d8334)</TEXT>

    <TITLE>Filecoin | Development Status and Mining Progress</TITLE>
    <DATE>2020-08-10 03:54:41</DATE>
    <TEXT>*Author: Gamals Ahmed, CoinEx Business Ambassador* https://preview.redd.it/5bqakdqgl3g51.jpg?width=865 amp;format=pjpg amp;auto=webp amp;s=b709794863977eb6554e3919b9e00ca750e3e704 A decentralized storage network that transforms cloud storage into an account market. Miners obtain the integrity of the original protocol by providing data storage and / or retrieval. On the contrary, customers pay miners to store or distribute data and retrieve it. **Filecoin** announced, that there will be more delays before its main network is officially launched. **Filecoin** developers postponed the release date of their main network to late July to late August 2020. As mentioned in a recent announcement, the Filecoin team said that the initiative completed the first round of the internal protocol security audit. Platform developers claim that the results of the review showed that they need to make several changes to the protocol #8217;s code base before performing the second stage of the software testing process. Created by Protocol Labs, Filecoin was developed using File System (IPFS), which is a peer-to-peer data storage network. Filecoin will allow users to trade storage space in an open and decentralized market. Filecoin developers implemented one of the largest cryptocurrency sales in 2017. They have privately obtained over $ 200 million from professional or accredited investors, including many institutional investors. The main network was slated to launch last month, but in February 2020, the Philly Queen development team delayed the release of the main network between July 15 and July 17, 2020. They claimed that the outbreak of the Coronavirus (COVID-19) in China was the main cause of the delay. The developers now say that they need more time to solve the problems found during a recent codecase audit. **The Filecoin team noted the following:**  #8220;We have drafted a number of protocol changes to ensure that building our major network launch is safe and economically sound. #8221; The project developers will add them to two different implementations of Filecoin (Lotus and go-filecoin) in the coming weeks. Filecoin developers conducted a survey to allow platform community members to cast their votes on three different launch dates for Testnet Phase 2 and mainnet. The team reported that the community gave their votes. Based on the vote results, the Filecoin team announced a  #8220;conservative #8221; estimate that the second phase of the network test should begin by May 11, 2020. The main Filecoin network may be launched sometime between July 20 and August 21, 2020. The updates to the project can be found on the Filecoin Road Map. **Filecoin developers stated:**  #8220;This option will make us get the most important protocol changes first, and then implement the rest as protocol updates during testnet. #8221; Filecoin is back down from the final test stage. Another filecoin decentralized storage network provider launched its catalytic test network, the final stage of the storage network test that supports the blockchain. In a blog post on her website, Filecoin said she will postpone the last test round until August. The company also announced a calibration period from July 20 to August 3 to allow miners to test their mining settings and get an idea of how competition conditions affected their rewards. Filecoin had announced earlier last month that the catalytic testnet test would precede its flagship launch. The delay in the final test also means that the company has returned the main launch window between August 31 and September 21. Despite the lack of clear incentives for miners and multiple delays, Filecoin has succeeded in attracting huge interest, especially in China. Investors remained highly speculating on the network #8217;s mining hardware and its premium price. **Mining in Filecoin** In most blockchain protocols,  #8220;miners #8221; are network participants who do the work necessary to promote and maintain the blockchain. To provide these services, miners are compensated in the original cryptocurrency. Mining in Filecoin works completely differently  #8212; instead of contributing to computational power, miners contribute storage capacity to use for dealing with customers looking to store data. **Filecoin will contain several types of miners:** Storage miners responsible for storing files and data on the network. Miners retrieval, responsible for providing quick tubes for file recovery. Miners repair to be carried out. Storage miners are the heart of the network. They earn Filecoin by storing data for clients, and computerizing cipher directories to check storage over time. The probability of earning the reward reward and transaction fees is proportional to the amount of storage that the Miner contributes to the Filecoin network, not the hash power. Retriever miners are the veins of the network. They earn Filecoin by winning bids and mining fees for a specific file, which is determined by the market value of the said file size. Miners bandwidth and recovery / initial transaction response time will determine its ability to close recovery deals on the network. The maximum bandwidth of the recovery miners will determine the total amount of deals that it can enter into. In the current implementation, the focus is mostly on storage miners, who sell storage capacity for FIL. ## Hardware recommendations **The current system specifications recommended for running the miner are:** * CPU 8+ * NVIDIA-manufactured GPU (to be expanded). * SSD drive designated as large buffer (512GB +). * Large amount of RAM for data replication account (128GB +) Compared to the hardware requirements for running a validity checker, these standards are much higher  #8212; although they definitely deserve it. Since these will not increase in the presumed future, the money spent on Filecoin mining hardware will provide users with many years of reliable service, and they pay themselves many times. Think of investing as a small business for cloud storage. To launch a model on the current data hosting model, it will cost millions of dollars in infrastructure and logistics to get started. With Filecoin, you can do the same for a few thousand dollars. **Proceed to mining** Deals are the primary function of the Filecoin network, and it represents an agreement between a client and miners for a  #8220;storage #8221; contract. Once the customer decides to have a miner to store based on the available capacity, duration and price required, he secures sufficient funds in a linked portfolio to cover the total cost of the deal. The deal is then published once the mine accepts the storage agreement. By default, all Filecoin miners are set to automatically accept any deal that meets their criteria, although this can be disabled for miners who prefer to organize their deals manually. After the deal is published, the customer prepares the data for storage and then transfers it to the miner. Upon receiving all the data, the miner fills in the data in a sector, closes it, and begins to provide proofs to the chain. Once the first confirmation is obtained, the customer can make sure the data is stored correctly, and the deal has officially started. Throughout the deal, the miner provides continuous proofs to the chain. Clients gradually pay with money they previously closed. If there is missing or late evidence, the miner is punished. More information about this can be found in the Runtime, Cut and Penalties section of this page. At Filecoin, miners earn two different types of rewards for their efforts: storage fees and reward prevention. Storage fees are the fees that customers pay regularly after reaching a deal, in exchange for storing data. This fee is automatically deposited into the withdrawal portfolio associated with miners while they continue to perform their duties over time, and is locked for a short period upon receipt. Block rewards are large sums given to miners calculated on a new block. Unlike storage fees, these rewards do not come from a linked customer; Instead, the new FIL  #8220;prints #8221; the network as an inflationary and incentive measure for miners to develop the chain. All active miners on the network have a chance to get a block bonus, their chance to be directly proportional to the amount of storage space that is currently being contributed to the network. **Duration of operation, cutting and penalties**  #8220;Slashing #8221; is a feature found in most blockchain protocols, and is used to punish miners who fail to provide reliable uptime or act maliciously against the network. In Filecoin, miners are susceptible to two different types of cut: storage error cut, unanimously reduce error. Storage Error Reduction is a term used to include a wider range of penalties, including error fees, sector penalties, and termination fees. Miners must pay these penalties if they fail to provide reliability of the sector or decide to leave the network voluntarily. An error fee is a penalty that a miner incurs for each non-working day. Sector punishment: A penalty incurred by a miner of a disrupted sector for which no error was reported before the WindowPoSt inspection. The sector will pay an error fee after the penalty of the sector once the error is discovered. Termination Fee: A penalty that a miner incurs when a sector is voluntary or involuntarily terminated and removed from the network. Cutting consensus error is the penalty that a miner incurs for committing consensus errors. This punishment applies to miners who have acted maliciously against the network consensus function. **Filecoin miners** Eight of the top 10 Felticoin miners are Chinese investors or companies, according to the blockchain explorer, while more companies are selling cloud mining contracts and distributed file sharing system hardware. CoinDesk #8217;s Wolfe Chao wrote:  #8220;China #8217;s craze for Filecoin may have been largely related to the long-standing popularity of crypto mining in the country overall, which is home to about 65% of the computing power on Bitcoin at discretion. #8221; With Filecoin approaching the launch of the mainnet blocknet  #8212; after several delays since the $ 200 million increase in 2017  #8212; Chinese investors are once again speculating strongly about network mining devices and their premium prices. Since Protocol Labs, the company behind Filecoin, released its  #8220;Test Incentives #8221; program on June 9 that was scheduled to start in a week #8217;s time, more than a dozen Chinese companies have started selling cloud mining contracts and hardware  #8212; despite important details such as economics Mining incentives on the main network are still endless. Sales volumes to date for each of these companies can range from half a million to tens of millions of dollars, according to self-reported data on these platforms that CoinDesk has watched and interviews with several mining hardware manufacturers. Filecoin #8217;s goal is to build a distributed storage network with token rewards to spur storage hosting as a way to drive wider adoption. Protocol Labs launched a test network in December 2019. But the tokens mined in the testing environment so far are not representative of the true silicon coin that can be traded when the main network is turned on. Moreover, the mining incentive economics on testnet do not represent how final block rewards will be available on the main network. However, data from Blockecoin #8217;s blocknetin testnet explorers show that eight out of 10 miners with the most effective mining force on testnet are currently Chinese miners. These eight miners have about 15 petabytes (PB) of effective storage mining power, accounting for more than 85% of the total test of 17.9 petable. For the context, 1 petabyte of hard disk storage = 1000 terabytes (terabytes) = 1 million gigabytes (GB). Filecoin craze in China may be closely related to the long-standing popularity of crypt mining in the country overall, which is home to about 65% of the computing power on Bitcoin by estimation. In addition, there has been a lot of hype in China about foreign exchange mining since 2018, as companies promote all types of devices when the network is still in development.  #8220;Encryption mining has always been popular in China, #8221; said Andy Tien, co-founder of 1475, one of several mining hardware manufacturers in Philquin supported by prominent Chinese video indicators such as Fenbushi and Hashkey Capital.  #8220;Even though the Velikoyen mining process is more technologically sophisticated, the idea of mining using hard drives instead of specialized machines like Bitcoin ASIC may be a lot easier for retailers to understand, #8221; he said. Meanwhile, according to Feixiaohao, a Chinese service comparable to CoinMarketCap, nearly 50 Chinese crypto exchanges are often somewhat unknown with some of the more well-known exchanges including Gate.io and Biki  #8212; have listed trading pairs for Filecoin currency contracts for USDT. In bitcoin mining, at the current difficulty level, one segment per second (TH / s) fragmentation rate is expected to generate around 0.000008 BTC within 24 hours. The higher the number of TH / s, the greater the number of bitcoins it should be able to produce proportionately. But in Filecoin, the efficient mining force of miners depends on the amount of data stamped on the hard drive, not the total size of the hard drive. To close data in the hard drive, the Filecoin miner still needs processing power, i.e. CPU or GPU as well as RAM. More powerful processors with improved software can confine data to the hard drive more quickly, so miners can combine more efficient mining energy faster on a given day. As of this stage, there appears to be no transparent way at the network level for retail investors to see how much of the purchased hard disk drive was purchased which actually represents an effective mining force. The U.S.-based Labs Protocol was behind Filecoin #8217;s initial coin offer for 2017, which raised an astonishing $ 200 million. This was in addition to a $ 50 million increase in private investment supported by notable venture capital projects including Sequoia, Anderson Horowitz and Union Square Ventures. CoinDk #8217;s parent company, CoinDk, has also invested in Protocol Labs. After rounds of delay, Protocol Protocols said in September 2019 that a testnet launch would be available around December 2019 and the main network would be rolled out in the first quarter of 2020. The test started as promised, but the main network has been delayed again and is now expected to launch in August 2020. What is Filecoin mining process? Filecoin mainly consists of three parts: the storage market (the chain), the blockecin Filecoin, and the search market (under the chain). Storage and research market in series and series respectively for security and efficiency. For users, the storage frequency is relatively low, and the security requirements are relatively high, so the storage process is placed on the chain. The retrieval frequency is much higher than the storage frequency when there is a certain amount of data. Given the performance problem in processing data on the chain, the retrieval process under the chain is performed. In order to solve the security issue of payment in the retrieval process, Filecoin adopts the micro-payment strategy. In simple terms, the process is to split the document into several copies, and every time the user gets a portion of the data, the corresponding fee is paid. Types of mines corresponding to Filecoin #8217;s two major markets are miners and warehousers, among whom miners are primarily responsible for storing data and block packages, while miners are primarily responsible for data query. After the stable operation of the major Filecoin network in the future, the mining operator will be introduced, who is the main responsible for data maintenance. In the initial release of Filecoin, the request matching mechanism was not implemented in the storage market and retrieval market, but the takeover mechanism was adopted. The three main parts of Filecoin correspond to three processes, namely the stored procedure, retrieval process, packaging and reward process. The following figure shows the simplified process and the income of the miners: The Filecoin mining process is much more complicated, and the important factor in determining the previous mining profit is efficient storage. Effective storage is a key feature that distinguishes Filecoin from other decentralized storage projects. In Filecoin #8217;s EC consensus, effective storage is similar to interest in PoS, which determines the likelihood that a miner will get the right to fill, that is, the proportion of miners effectively stored in the entire network is proportional to final mining revenue. It is also possible to obtain higher effective storage under the same hardware conditions by improving the mining algorithm. However, the current increase in the number of benefits that can be achieved by improving the algorithm is still unknown. **It seeks to promote mining using Filecoin Discover** Filecoin announced Filecoin Discover  #8212; a step to encourage miners to join the Filecoin network. According to the company, Filecoin Discover is  #8220;an ever-growing catalog of numerous petabytes of public data covering literature, science, art, and history. #8221; Miners interested in sharing can choose which data sets they want to store, and receive that data on a drive at a cost. In exchange for storing this verified data, miners will earn additional Filecoin above the regular block rewards for storing data. Includes the current catalog of open source data sets; ENCODE, 1000 Genomes, Project Gutenberg, Berkley Self-driving data, more projects, and datasets are added every day. **Ian Darrow, Head of Operations at Filecoin, commented on the announcement:**  #8220;Over 2.5 quintillion bytes of data are created every day. This data includes 294 billion emails, 500 million tweets and 64 billion messages on social media. But it is also climatology reports, disease tracking maps, connected vehicle coordinates and much more. It is extremely important that we maintain data that will serve as the backbone for future research and discovery #8221;. Miners who choose to participate in Filecoin Discover may receive hard drives pre-loaded with verified data, as well as setup and maintenance instructions, depending on the company. The Filecoin team will also host the Slack (fil-Discover-support) channel where miners can learn more. Filecoin got its fair share of obstacles along the way. Last month Filecoin announced a further delay before its main network was officially launched  #8212; after years of raising funds. In late July QEBR (OTC: QEBR) announced that it had ceded ownership of two subsidiaries in order to focus all of the company #8217;s resources on building blockchain-based mining operations. The QEBR technology team previously announced that it has proven its system as a Filecoin node valid with CPU, GPU, bandwidth and storage compatibility that meets all IPFS guidelines. The QEBR test system is connected to the main Filecoin blockchain and the already mined filecoin coin has already been tested.  #8220;The disclosure of Sheen Boom and Jihye will allow our team to focus only on the upcoming global launch of Filecoin. QEBR branch, Shenzhen DZD Digital Technology Ltd. ( #8220; DZD  #8220;), has a strong background in blockchain development, extraction Data, data acquisition, data processing, data technology research. We strongly believe Filecoin has the potential to be a leading blockchain-based cryptocurrency and will make every effort to make QEBR an important player when Mainecoin mainnet will be launched soon #8221;. **IPFS and Filecoin** Filecoin and IPFS are complementary protocols for storing and sharing data in a decentralized network. While users are not required to use Filecoin and IPFS together, the two combined are working to resolve major failures in the current web infrastructure. **IPFS** It is an open source protocol that allows users to store and transmit verifiable data with each other. IPFS users insist on data on the network by installing it on their own device, to a third-party cloud service (known as Pinning Services), or through community-oriented systems where a group of individual IPFS users share resources to ensure the content stays live. The lack of an integrated catalytic mechanism is the challenge Filecoin hopes to solve by allowing users to catalyze long-term distributed storage at competitive prices through the storage contract market, while maintaining the efficiency and flexibility that the IPFS network provides. **Using IPFS** In IPFS, the data is hosted by the required data installation nodes. For data to persist while the user node is offline, users must either rely on their other peers to install their data voluntarily or use a central install service to store data. Peer-to-peer reliance caching data may be a good thing as one or multiple organizations share common files on an internal network, or where strong social contracts can be used to ensure continued hosting and preservation of content in the long run. Most users in an IPFS network use an installation service. **Using Filecoin** The last option is to install your data in a decentralized storage market, such as Filecoin. In Filecoin #8217;s structure, customers make regular small payments to store data when a certain availability, while miners earn those payments by constantly checking the integrity of this data, storing it, and ensuring its quick recovery. This allows users to motivate Filecoin miners to ensure that their content will be live when it is needed, a distinct advantage of relying only on other network users as required using IPFS alone. **Filecoin, powered by IPFS** It is important to know that Filecoin is built on top of IPFS. Filecoin aims to be a very integrated and seamless storage market that takes advantage of the basic functions provided by IPFS, they are connected to each other, but can be implemented completely independently of each other. Users do not need to interact with Filecoin in order to use IPFS. **Some advantages of sharing Filecoin with IPFS:** * Filecoin and IPFS CIDs share hash specifications. * Use libp2p by Filecoin nodes to create secure connections with each other. * Messaging between nodes and cluster propagation is facilitated in Filecoin by libp2p pubsub. * IPLD use for blockchain data structures. * Use Graphsync to transfer data between nodes. Of all the decentralized storage projects, Filecoin is undoubtedly the most interested, and IPFS has been running stably for two years, fully demonstrating the strength of its core protocol. Filecoin #8217;s ability to obtain market share from traditional central storage depends on end-user experience and storage price. Currently, most Filecoin nodes are posted in the IDC room. Actual deployment and operation costs are not reduced compared to traditional central cloud storage, and the storage process is more complicated. PoRep and PoSt, which has a large number of proofs of unknown operation, are required to cause the actual storage cost to be so, in the early days of the release of Filecoin. The actual cost of storing data may be higher than the cost of central cloud storage, but the initial storage node may reduce the storage price in order to obtain block rewards, which may result in the actual storage price lower than traditional central cloud storage. In the long term, Filecoin still needs to take full advantage of its P2P storage, convert storage devices from specialization to civil use, and improve its algorithms to reduce storage costs without affecting user experience. The storage problem is an important problem to be solved in the blockchain field, so a large number of storage projects were presented at the 19th Web3 Summit. IPFS is an important part of Web3 visibility. Its development will affect the development of Web3 to some extent. Likewise, Web3 development somewhat determines the future of IPFS. Filecoin is an IPFS-based storage class project initiated by IPFS. There is no doubt that he is highly expected. **Resources :** 1.

    <TITLE>RESEARCH REPORT ABOUT KYBER NETWORK</TITLE>
    <DATE>2020-08-11 09:34:37</DATE>
    <TEXT>*Author: Gamals Ahmed, CoinEx Business Ambassador*  #8203; https://preview.redd.it/9k31yy1bdcg51.jpg?width=936 amp;format=pjpg amp;auto=webp amp;s=99bcb7c3f50b272b7d97247b369848b5d8cc6053 # ABSTRACT In this research report, we present a study on Kyber Network. Kyber Network is a decentralized, on-chain liquidity protocol designed to make trading tokens simple, efficient, robust and secure. Kyber design allows any party to contribute to an aggregated pool of liquidity within each blockchain while providing a single endpoint for takers to execute trades using the best rates available. We envision a connected liquidity network that facilitates seamless, decentralized cross-chain token swaps across Kyber based networks on different chains. Kyber is a fully on-chain liquidity protocol that enables decentralized exchange of cryptocurrencies in any application. Liquidity providers (Reserves) are integrated into one single endpoint for takers and users. When a user requests a trade, the protocol will scan the entire network to find the reserve with the best price and take liquidity from that particular reserve. ## 1.INTRODUCTION DeFi applications all need access to good liquidity sources, which is a critical component to provide good services. Currently, decentralized liquidity is comprised of various sources including DEXes (Uniswap, OasisDEX, Bancor), decentralized funds and other financial apps. The more scattered the sources, the harder it becomes for anyone to either find the best rate for their trade or to even find enough liquidity for their need. Kyber is a blockchain-based liquidity protocol that aggregates liquidity from a wide range of reserves, powering instant and secure token exchange in any decentralized application. The protocol allows for a wide range of implementation possibilities for liquidity providers, allowing a wide range of entities to contribute liquidity, including end users, decentralized exchanges and other decentralized protocols. On the taker side, end users, cryptocurrency wallets, and smart contracts are able to perform instant and trustless token trades at the best rates available amongst the sources. The Kyber Network is project based on the Ethereum protocol that seeks to completely decentralize the exchange of crypto currencies and make exchange trustless by keeping everything on the blockchain. Through the Kyber Network, users should be able to instantly convert or exchange any crypto currency. ## 1.1 OVERVIEW ABOUT KYBER NETWORK PROTOCOL The Kyber Network is a decentralized way to exchange ETH and different ERC20 tokens instantly  #8212; no waiting and no registration needed. Using this protocol, developers can build innovative payment flows and applications, including instant token swap services, ERC20 payments, and financial DApps  #8212; helping to build a world where any token is usable anywhere. Kyber #8217;s fully on-chain design allows for full transparency and verifiability in the matching engine, as well as seamless composability with DApps, not all of which are possible with off-chain or hybrid approaches. The integration of a large variety of liquidity providers also makes Kyber uniquely capable of supporting sophisticated schemes and catering to the needs of DeFi DApps and financial institutions. Hence, many developers leverage Kyber #8217;s liquidity pool to build innovative financial applications, and not surprisingly, Kyber is the most used DeFi protocol in the world. The Kyber Network is quite an established project that is trying to change the way we think of decentralised crypto currency exchange. The Kyber Network has seen very rapid development. After being announced in May 2017 the testnet for the Kyber Network went live in August 2017. An ICO followed in September 2017, with the company raising 200,000 ETH valued at $60 million in just one day. The live main net was released in February 2018 to whitelisted participants, and on March 19, 2018, the Kyber Network opened the main net as a public beta. Since then the network has seen increasing growth, with network volumes growing more than 500% in the first half of 2019. Although there was a modest decrease in August 2019 that can be attributed to the price of ETH dropping by 50%, impacting the overall total volumes being traded and processed globally. They are developing a decentralised exchange protocol that will allow developers to build payment flows and financial apps. This is indeed quite a competitive market as a number of other such protocols have been launched. **In Brief** \- Kyber Network is a tool that allows anyone to swap tokens instantly without having to use exchanges. \- It allows vendors to accept different types of cryptocurrency while still being paid in their preferred crypto of choice. \- It #8217;s built primarily for Ethereum, but any smart-contract based blockchain can incorporate it. At its core, Kyber is a decentralized way to exchange ETH and different **ERC20 tokens** instantly #8211;no waiting and no registration needed. To do this Kyber uses a diverse set of liquidity pools, or pools of different crypto assets called  #8220;reserves #8221; that any project can tap into or integrate with. A typical use case would be if a vendor allowed customers to pay in whatever currency they wish, but receive the payment in their preferred token. Another example would be for Dapp users. At present, if you are not a token holder of a certain Dapp you can #8217;t use it. With Kyber, you could use your existing tokens, instantly swap them for the Dapp specific token and away you go. All this swapping happens directly on the Ethereum blockchain, meaning every transaction is completely transparent. ## 1.1.1 WHY BUILD THE KYBER NETWORK? While crypto currencies were built to be decentralized, many of the exchanges for trading crypto currencies have become centralized affairs. This has led to security vulnerabilities, with many exchanges becoming the victims of hacking and theft. It has also led to increased fees and costs, and the centralized exchanges often come with slow transfer times as well. In some cases, wallets have been locked and users are unable to withdraw their coins. Decentralized exchanges have popped up recently to address the flaws in the centralized exchanges, but they have their own flaws, most notably a lack of liquidity, and often times high costs to modify trades in their on-chain order books.  #8203; [ Some of the Integrations with Kyber Protocol ](https://preview.redd.it/lvh711zmdcg51.png?width=700 amp;format=png amp;auto=webp amp;s=3d5e7f3a0c5a67c33f689263cc8f86a525c4cbc3) The Kyber Network was formed to provide users with a decentralized exchange that keeps everything right on the blockchain, and uses a reserve system rather than an order book to provide high liquidity at all times. This will allow for the exchange and transfer of any cryptocurrency, even cross exchanges, and costs will be kept at a minimum as well. **The Kyber Network has three guiding design philosophies since the start:** 1. To be most useful the network needs to be platform-agnostic, which allows any protocol or application the ability to take advantage of the liquidity provided by the Kyber Network without any impact on innovation. 2. The network was designed to make real-world commerce and decentralized financial products not only possible but also feasible. It does this by allowing for instant token exchange across a wide range of tokens, and without any settlement risk. 3. The Kyber Network was created with ease of integration as a priority, which is why everything runs fully on-chain and fully transparent. Kyber is not only developer-friendly, but is also compatible with a wide variety of systems. ## 1.1.2 WHO INVENTED KYBER? Kyber #8217;s founders are Loi Luu, Victor Tran, Yaron Velner  #8212; CEO, CTO, and advisor to the Kyber Network. ## 1.1.3 WHAT DISTINGUISHES KYBER? Kyber #8217;s mission has always been to integrate with other protocols so they #8217;ve focused on being developer-friendly by providing architecture to allow anyone to incorporate the technology onto any smart-contract powered blockchain. As a result, a variety of different [dapps](https://decrypt.co/resources/dapps), vendors, and [wallets](https://decrypt.co/resources/wallets) use Kyber #8217;s infrastructure including Set Protocol, bZx, InstaDApp, and [Coinbase](https://decrypt.co/resources/a-4-minute-guide-to-the-californian-exchange-page) wallet. Besides, dapps, vendors, and wallets, Kyber also [integrates with other exchanges such as Uniswap ](https://blog.kyber.network/kyber-ecosystem-report-1-e9b8a4128226) #8212; sharing liquidity pools between the two protocols. A typical use case would be if a vendor allowed customers to pay in whatever currency they wish, but receive the payment in their preferred token. Another example would be for Dapp users. At present, if you are not a token holder of a certain Dapp you can #8217;t use it. With Kyber, you could use your existing tokens, instantly swap them for the Dapp specific token and away you go. Limit orders on Kyber allow users to set a specific price in which they would like to exchange a token instead of accepting whatever price currently exists at the time of trading. However, unlike with other exchanges, users never lose custody of their crypto assets during limit orders on Kyber. The Kyber protocol works by using pools of crypto funds called  #8220;reserves #8221;, which currently support over 70 different **ERC20 tokens**. Reserves are essentially smart contracts with a pool of funds. Different parties with different prices and levels of funding control all reserves. Instead of using order books to match buyers and sellers to return the best price, the Kyber protocol looks at all the reserves and returns the best price among the different reserves. Reserves make money on the  #8220;spread #8221; or differences between the buying and selling prices. The Kyber wants any token holder to easily convert one token to another with a minimum of fuss. ## 1.2 KYBER PROTOCOL The protocol smart contracts offer a single interface for the best available token exchange rates to be taken from an aggregated liquidity pool across diverse sources.  #9679; **Aggregated liquidity pool.** The protocol aggregates various liquidity sources into one liquidity pool, making it easy for takers to find the best rates offered with one function call.  #9679; **Diverse sources of liquidity.** The protocol allows different types of liquidity sources to be plugged into. Liquidity providers may employ different strategies and different implementations to contribute liquidity to the protocol.  #9679; **Permissionless.** The protocol is designed to be permissionless where any developer can set up various types of reserves, and any end user can contribute liquidity. Implementations need to take into consideration various security vectors, such as reserve spamming, but can be mitigated through a staking mechanism. We can expect implementations to be permissioned initially until the maintainers are confident about these considerations. The core feature that the Kyber protocol facilitates is the token swap between taker and liquidity sources. The protocol aims to provide the following properties for token trades:  #9679; **Instant Settlement.** Takers do not have to wait for their orders to be fulfilled, since trade matching and settlement occurs in a single blockchain transaction. This enables trades to be part of a series of actions happening in a single smart contract function.  #9679; **Atomicity.** When takers make a trade request, their trade either gets fully executed, or is reverted. This  #8220;all or nothing #8221; aspect means that takers are not exposed to the risk of partial trade execution.  #9679; **Public rate verification.** Anyone can verify the rates that are being offered by reserves and have their trades instantly settled just by querying from the smart contracts.  #9679; **Ease of integration.** Trustless and atomic token trades can be directly and easily integrated into other smart contracts, thereby enabling multiple trades to be performed in a smart contract function. **How each actor works is specified in Section Network Actors.** 1. Takers refer to anyone who can directly call the smart contract functions to trade tokens, such as end-users, DApps, and wallets. 2. Reserves refer to anyone who wishes to provide liquidity. They have to implement the smart contract functions defined in the reserve interface in order to be registered and have their token pairs listed. 3. Registered reserves refer to those that will be cycled through for matching taker requests. 4. Maintainers refer to anyone who has permission to access the functions for the adding/removing of reserves and token pairs, such as a DAO or the team behind the protocol implementation. 5. In all, they comprise of the network, which refers to all the actors involved in any given implementation of the protocol. **The protocol implementation needs to have the following:** 1. Functions for takers to check rates and execute the trades 2. Functions for the maintainers to register/remove reserves and token pairs 3. Reserve interface that defines the functions reserves needs to implement https://preview.redd.it/d2tcxc7wdcg51.png?width=700 amp;format=png amp;auto=webp amp;s=b2afde388a77054e6731772b9115ee53f09b6a4a ## 1.3 KYBER CORE SMART CONTRACTS Kyber Core smart contracts is an implementation of the protocol that has major protocol functions to allow actors to join and interact with the network. For example, the Kyber Core smart contracts provide functions for the listing and delisting of reserves and trading pairs by having clear interfaces for the reserves to comply to be able to register to the network and adding support for new trading pairs. In addition, the Kyber Core smart contracts also provide a function for takers to query the best rate among all the registered reserves, and perform the trades with the corresponding rate and reserve. A trading pair consists of a quote token and any other token that the reserve wishes to support. The quote token is the token that is either traded from or to for all trades. For example, the Ethereum implementation of the Kyber protocol uses Ether as the quote token. In order to search for the best rate, all reserves supporting the requested token pair will be iterated through. Hence, the Kyber Core smart contracts need to have this search algorithm implemented. The key functions implemented in the Kyber Core Smart Contracts are listed in Figure 2 below. We will visit and explain the implementation details and security considerations of each function in the Specification Section. ## 1.4 HOW KYBER #8217;S ON-CHAIN PROTOCOL WORKS? Kyber is the liquidity infrastructure for decentralized finance. Kyber aggregates liquidity from diverse sources into a pool, which provides the best rates for takers such as DApps, Wallets, DEXs, and End users. ## 1.4.1 PROVIDING LIQUIDITY AS A RESERVE Anyone can operate a Kyber Reserve to market make for profit and make their tokens available for DApps in the ecosystem. Through an open reserve architecture, individuals, token teams and professional market makers can contribute token assets to Kyber #8217;s liquidity pool and earn from the spread in every trade. These tokens become available at the best rates across DApps that tap into the network, making them instantly more liquid and useful. **MAIN RESERVE TYPES** Kyber currently has over 45 reserves in its network providing liquidity. There are 3 main types of reserves that allow different liquidity contribution options to suit the unique needs of different providers. **1. Automated Price Reserves (APR)**  #8212; Allows token teams and users with large token holdings to have an automated yet customized pricing system with low maintenance costs. Synthetix and Melon are examples of teams that run APRs. **2. Fed Price Reserves (FPR)**  #8212; Operated by professional market makers that require custom and advanced pricing strategies tailored to their specific needs. Kyber alongside reserves such as OneBit, runs FPRs. **3. Bridge Reserves (BR)**  #8212; These are specialized reserves meant to bring liquidity from other on-chain liquidity providers like Uniswap, Oasis, DutchX, and Bancor into the network. [ ](https://preview.redd.it/oi2948t1ecg51.png?width=700 amp;format=png amp;auto=webp amp;s=b1155e6196bfdb35b1059e13b8537f9c0e643e44) # 1.5 KYBER NETWORK ROLES **There Kyber Network functions through coordination between several different roles and functions as explained below:** \- **Users**  #8212; This entity uses the Kyber Network to send and receive tokens. A user can be an individual, a merchant, and even a smart contract account. \- **Reserve Entities**  #8212; This role is used to add liquidity to the platform through the dynamic reserve pool. Some reserve entities are internal to the Kyber Network, but others may be registered third parties. Reserve entities may be public if the public contributes to the reserves they hold, otherwise they are considered private. By allowing third parties as reserve entities the network adds diversity, which prevents monopolization and keeps exchange rates competitive. Allowing third party reserve entities also allows for the listing of less popular coins with lower volumes. \- **Reserve Contributors**  #8212; Where reserve entities are classified as public, the reserve contributor is the entity providing reserve funds. Their incentive for doing so is a profit share from the reserve. \- **The Reserve Manager**  #8212; Maintains the reserve, calculates exchange rates and enters them into the network. The reserve manager profits from exchange spreads set by them on their reserves. They can also benefit from increasing volume by accessing the entire Kyber Network. \- **The Kyber Network Operator**  #8212; Currently the Kyber Network team is filling the role of the network operator, which has a function to adds/remove Reserve Entities as well as controlling the listing of tokens. Eventually, this role will revert to a proper decentralized governance. ## 1.6 BASIC TOKEN TRADE A basic token trade is one that has the quote token as either the source or destination token of the trade request. The execution flow of a basic token trade is depicted in the diagram below, where a taker would like to exchange BAT tokens for ETH as an example. The trade happens in a single blockchain transaction. 1. Taker sends 1 ETH to the protocol contract, and would like to receive BAT in return. 2. Protocol contract queries the first reserve for its ETH to BAT exchange rate. 3. Reserve 1 offers an exchange rate of 1 ETH for 800 BAT. 4. Protocol contract queries the second reserve for its ETH to BAT exchange rate. 5. Reserve 2 offers an exchange rate of 1 ETH for 820 BAT. 6. This process goes on for the other reserves. After the iteration, reserve 2 is discovered to have offered the best ETH to BAT exchange rate. 7. Protocol contract sends 1 ETH to reserve 2. 8. The reserve sends 820 BAT to the taker. ## 1.7 TOKEN-TO-TOKEN TRADE A token-to-token trade is one where the quote token is neither the source nor the destination token of the trade request. The exchange flow of a token to token trade is depicted in the diagram below, where a taker would like to exchange BAT tokens for DAI as an example. The trade happens in a single blockchain transaction. 1. Taker sends 50 BAT to the protocol contract, and would like to receive DAI in return. 2. Protocol contract sends 50 BAT to the reserve offering the best BAT to ETH rate. 3. Protocol contract receives 1 ETH in return. 4. Protocol contract sends 1 ETH to the reserve offering the best ETH to DAI rate. 5. Protocol contract receives 30 DAI in return. 6. Protocol contract sends 30 DAI to the user. ## 2.KYBER NETWORK CRYSTAL (KNC) TOKEN Kyber Network Crystal (KNC) is an ERC-20 utility token and an integral part of Kyber Network. KNC is the first deflationary staking token where staking rewards and token burns are generated from actual network usage and growth in DeFi. The Kyber Network Crystal (KNC) is the backbone of the Kyber Network. It works to connect liquidity providers and those who need liquidity and serves three distinct purposes. The first of these is to collect transaction fees, and a portion of every fee collected is burned, which keeps KNC deflationary. Kyber Network Crystals (KNC), are named after the crystals in Star Wars used to power light sabers. The KNC also ensures the smooth operation of the reserve system in the Kyber liquidity since entities must use third-party tokens to buy the KNC that pays for their operations in the network. KNC allows token holders to play a critical role in determining the incentive system, building a wide base of stakeholders, and facilitating economic flow in the network. A small fee is charged each time a token exchange happens on the network, and KNC holders get to vote on this fee model and distribution, as well as other important decisions. Over time, as more trades are executed, additional fees will be generated for staking rewards and reserve rebates, while more KNC will be burned. \- **Participation rewards**  #8212; KNC holders can stake KNC in the KyberDAO and vote on key parameters. Voters will earn staking rewards (in ETH) \- **Burning**  #8212; Some of the network fees will be burned to reduce KNC supply permanently, providing long-term value accrual from decreasing supply. \- **Reserve incentives**  #8212; KNC holders determine the portion of network fees that are used as rebates for selected liquidity providers (reserves) based on their volume performance. [ ](https://preview.redd.it/9l5sc9u7ecg51.png?width=700 amp;format=png amp;auto=webp amp;s=9df6a3e40efda462a10c039705928c261857d227) Finally, the KNC token is the connection between the Kyber Network and the exchanges, wallets, and dApps that leverage the liquidity network. This is a virtuous system since entities are rewarded with referral fees for directing more users to the Kyber Network, which helps increase adoption for Kyber and for the entities using the Network. And of course there will soon be a fourth and fifth uses for the KNC, which will be as a staking token used to generate passive income, as well as a governance token used to vote on key parameters of the network. The Kyber Network Crystal (KNC) was released in a September 2017 ICO at a price around $1. There were 226,000,000 KNC minted for the ICO, with 61% sold to the public. The remaining 39% are controlled 50/50 by the company and the founders/advisors, with a 1 year lockup period and 2 year vesting period. Currently, just over 180 million coins are in circulation, and the total supply has been reduced to 210.94 million after the company burned 1 millionth KNC token in May 2019 and then its second millionth KNC token just three months later. That means that while it took 15 months to burn the first million KNC, it took just 10 weeks to burn the second million KNC. That shows how rapidly adoption has been growing recently for Kyber, with July 2019 USD trading volumes on the Kyber Network nearly reaching $60 million. This volume has continued growing, and on march 13, 2020 the network experienced its highest daily trading activity of $33.7 million in a 24-hour period. Currently KNC is required by Reserve Managers to operate on the network, which ensures a minimum amount of demand for the token. Combined with future plans for burning coins, price is expected to maintain an upward bias, although it has suffered along with the broader market in 2018 and more recently during the summer of 2019. It was unfortunate in 2020 that a beginning rally was cut short by the coronavirus pandemic, although the token has stabilized as of April 2020, and there are hopes the rally could resume in the summer of 2020. ## 2.1 HOW ARE KNC TOKENS PRODUCED? The native token of Kyber is called Kyber Network Crystals (KNC). All reserves are required to pay fees in KNC for the right to manage reserves. The KNC collected as fees are either burned and taken out of the total supply or awarded to integrated dapps as an incentive to help them grow. ## 2.2 HOW DO YOU GET HOLD OF KNC TOKENS? Kyber Swap can be used to buy ETH directly using a credit card, which can then be used to swap for KNC. Besides Kyber itself, exchanges such as Binance, Huobi, and OKex trade KNC. ## 2.3 WHAT CAN YOU DO WITH KYBER? The most direct and basic function of Kyber is for instantly swapping tokens without registering an account, which anyone can do using an Etheruem wallet such as [MetaMask](https://decrypt.co/resources/metamask). Users can also create their own reserves and contribute funds to a reserve, but that process is still fairly technical one #8211;something Kyber is working on making easier for users in the future. ## 2.4 THE GOAL OF KYBER THE FUTURE The goal of Kyber in the coming years is to solidify its position as a one-stop solution for powering liquidity and token swapping on Ethereum. Kyber plans on a major protocol upgrade called Katalyst, which will create new incentives and growth opportunities for all stakeholders in their ecosystem, especially KNC holders. The upgrade will mean more use cases for KNC including to use KNC to vote on governance decisions through a decentralized organization (DAO) called the KyberDAO. With our upcoming Katalyst protocol upgrade and new KNC model, Kyber will provide even more benefits for stakeholders. For instance, reserves will no longer need to hold a KNC balance for fees, removing a major friction point, and there will be rebates for top performing reserves. KNC holders can also stake their KNC to participate in governance and receive rewards. ## 2.5 BUYING  amp; STORING KNC Those interested in buying KNC tokens can do so at a number of exchanges. Perhaps your best bet between the complete list is the likes of Coinbase Pro and Binance. The former is based in the USA whereas the latter is an offshore exchange. The trading volume is well spread out at these exchanges, which means that the liquidity is not concentrated and dependent on any one exchange. You also have decent liquidity on each of the exchange books. For example, the Binance BTC / KNC books are wide and there is decent turnover. This means easier order execution. KNC is an ERC20 token and can be stored in any wallet with ERC20 support, such as MyEtherWallet or MetaMask. One interesting alternative is the KyberSwap Android mobile app that was released in August 2019. It allows for instant swapping of tokens and has support for over 70 different altcoins. It also allows users to set price alerts and limit orders and works as a full-featured Ethereum wallet. ## 2.6 KYBER KATALYST UPGRADE Kyber has announced their intention to become the de facto liquidity layer for the Decentralized Finance space, aiming to have Kyber as the single on-chain endpoint used by the majority of liquidity providers and dApp developers. In order to achieve this goal the Kyber Network team is looking to create an open ecosystem that garners trust from the decentralized finance space. They believe this is the path that will lead the majority of projects, developers, and users to choose Kyber for liquidity needs. With that in mind they have recently announced the launch of a protocol upgrade to Kyber which is being called **Katalyst**. The Katalyst upgrade will create a stronger ecosystem by creating strong alignments towards a common goal, while also strengthening the incentives for stakeholders to participate in the ecosystem. **The primary beneficiaries of the Katalyst upgrade will be the three major Kyber stakeholders:** 1. Reserve managers who provide network liquidity; 2. dApps that connect takers to Kyber; 3. KNC holders. **These stakeholders can expect to see benefits as highlighted below:** Reserve Managers will see two new benefits to providing liquidity for the network. The first of these benefits will be incentives for providing reserves. Once Katalyst is implemented part of the fees collected will go to the reserve managers as an incentive for providing liquidity. This mechanism is similar to rebates in traditional finance, and is expected to drive the creation of additional reserves and market making, which in turn will lead to greater liquidity and platform reach. Katalyst will also do away with the need for reserve managers to maintain a KNC balance for use as network fees. Instead fees will be automatically collected and used as incentives or burned as appropriate. This should remove a great deal of friction for reserves to connect with Kyber without affecting the competitive exchange rates that takers in the system enjoy. dApp Integrators will now be able to set their own spread, which will give them full control over their own business model. This means the current fee sharing program that shares 30% of the 0.25% fee with dApp developers will go away and developers will determine their own spread. It #8217;s believed this will increase dApp development within Kyber as developers will now be in control of fees. KNC Holders, often thought of as the core of the Kyber Network, will be able to take advantage of a new staking mechanism that will allow them to receive a portion of network fees by staking their KNC and participating in the KyberDAO. ## 2.7 COMING KYBERDAO With the implementation of the Katalyst protocol the KNC holders will be put right at the heart of Kyber. Holders of KNC tokens will now have a critical role to play in determining the future economic flow of the network, including its incentive systems. The primary way this will be achieved is through [KyberDAO](https://blog.kyber.network/kyberdao-staking-and-voting-overview-70be71ee58f0), a way in which on-chain and off-chain governance will align to streamline cooperation between the Kyber team, KNC holders, and market participants. **The Kyber Network team has identified 3 key areas of consideration for the KyberDAO:** 1. Broad representation, transparent governance and network stability 2. Strong incentives for KNC holders to maintain their stake and be highly involved in governance 3. Maximizing participation with a wide range of options for voting delegation [ Interaction between KNC Holders  amp; Kyber ](https://preview.redd.it/demv90gdecg51.png?width=700 amp;format=png amp;auto=webp amp;s=6070345cc2805cf92db80ab9cedf16f28b20c990) This means KNC holders have been empowered to determine the network fee and how to allocate the fees to ensure maximum network growth. KNC holders will now have three fee allocation options to vote on: \- Voting Rewards: Immediate value creation. Holders who stake and participate in the KyberDAO get their share of the fees designated for rewards. \- Burning: Long term value accrual. The decreasing supply of KNC will improve the token appreciation over time and benefit those who did not participate. \- Reserve Incentives:Value creation via network growth. By rewarding Kyber reserve managers based on their performance, it helps to drive greater volume, value, and network fees. # 2.8 TRANSPARENCY AND STABILITY The design of the KyberDAO is meant to allow for the greatest network stability, as well as maximum transparency and the ability to quickly recover in emergency situations. Initally the Kyber team will remain as maintainers of the KyberDAO. The system is being developed to be as verifiable as possible, while still maintaining maximum transparency regarding the role of the maintainer in the DAO. Part of this transparency means that all data and processes are stored on-chain if feasible. Voting regarding network fees and allocations will be done on-chain and will be immutable. In situations where on-chain storage or execution is not feasible there will be a set of off-chain governance processes developed to ensure all decisions are followed through on. ## 2.9 KNC STAKING AND DELEGATION Staking will be a new addition and both staking and voting will be done in fixed periods of times called  #8220;epochs #8221;. These epochs will be measured in Ethereum block times, and each KyberDAO epoch will last roughly 2 weeks. This is a relatively rapid epoch and it is beneficial in that it gives more rapid DAO conclusion and decision-making, while also conferring faster reward distribution. On the downside it means there needs to be a new voting campaign every two weeks, which requires more frequent participation from KNC stakeholders, as well as more work from the Kyber team. Delegation will be part of the protocol, allowing stakers to delegate their voting rights to third-party pools or other entities. The pools receiving the delegation rights will be free to determine their own fee structure and voting decisions. Because the pools will share in rewards, and because their voting decisions will be clearly visible on-chain, it is expected that they will continue to work to the benefit of the network. ## 3. TRADING After the September 2017 ICO, KNC settled into a trading price that hovered around $1.00 (decreasing in BTC value) until December. The token has followed the trend of most other altcoins  #8212; rising in price through December and sharply declining toward the beginning of January 2018. The KNC price fell throughout all of 2018 with one exception during April. From April 6th to April 28th, the price rose over 200 percent. This run-up coincided with a [blog post](https://blog.kyber.network/bringing-bitcoin-to-ethereum-7bf29db88b9a) outlining plans to bring Bitcoin to the Ethereum blockchain. Since then, however, the price has steadily fallen, currently resting on what looks like a $0.15 (\~0.000045 BTC) floor. With the number of partners using the Kyber Network, the price may rise as they begin to fully use the network. The development team has consistently hit the milestones they #8217;ve set out to achieve, so make note of any release announcements on the horizon. ## 4. COMPETITION The [0x project](https://coincentral.com/0x-beginner-guide/) is the biggest competitor to Kyber Network. Both teams are attempting to enter the decentralized exchange market. The primary difference between the two is that Kyber performs the entire exchange process on-chain while 0x keeps the order book and matching off-chain. As a crypto swap exchange, the platform also competes with **ShapeShift** and **Changelly**. ## 5.KYBER MILESTONES  #8226; June 2020: Digifox, an all-in-one finance application by popular crypto trader and Youtuber Nicholas Merten a.k.a DataDash (340K subs), integrated Kyber to enable users to easily swap between cryptocurrencies without having to leave the application.  #8226; June 2020: Stake Capital partnered with Kyber to provide convenient KNC staking and delegation services, and also took a KNC position to participate in governance.  #8226; June 2020: Outlined the benefits of the Fed Price Reserve (FPR) for professional market makers and advanced developers.  #8226; May 2020: Kyber crossed US$1 Billion in total trading volume and 1 Million transactions, performed entirely on-chain on Ethereum.  #8226; May 2020: StakeWith.Us partnered Kyber Network as a KyberDAO Pool Master.  #8226; May 2020: 2Key, a popular blockchain referral solution using smart links, integrated Kyber #8217;s on-chain liquidity protocol for seamless token swaps  #8226; May 2020: Blockchain game League of Kingdoms integrated Kyber to accept Token Payments for Land NFTs.  #8226; May 2020: Joined the Zcash Developer Alliance , an invite-only working group to advance Zcash development and interoperability.  #8226; May 2020: Joined the Chicago DeFi Alliance to help accelerate on-chain market making for professionals and developers.  #8226; March 2020: Set a new record of USD $33.7M in 24H fully on-chain trading volume, and $190M in 30 day on-chain trading volume.  #8226; March 2020: Integrated by Rarible, Bullionix, and Unstoppable Domains, with the KyberWidget deployed on IPFS, which allows anyone to swap tokens through Kyber without being blocked.  #8226; February 2020: Popular Ethereum blockchain game Axie Infinity integrated Kyber to accept ERC20 payments for NFT game items.  #8226; February 2020: Kyber #8217;s protocol was integrated by Gelato Finance, Idle Finance, rTrees, Sablier, and 0x API for their liquidity needs.  #8226; January 2020: Kyber Network was found to be the most used protocol in the whole decentralized finance (DeFi) space in 2019, according to a DeFi research report by Binance.  #8226; December 2019: Switcheo integrated Kyber #8217;s protocol for enhanced liquidity on their own DEX.  #8226; December 2019: DeFi Wallet Eidoo integrated Kyber for seamless in-wallet token swaps.  #8226; December 2019: Announced the development of the Katalyst Protocol Upgrade and new KNC token model.  #8226; July 2019: Developed the Waterloo Bridge , a Decentralized Practical Cross-chain Bridge between EOS and Ethereum, successfully demonstrating a token swap between Ethereum to EOS.  #8226; July 2019: Trust Wallet, the official Binance wallet, integrated Kyber as part of its decentralized token exchange service, allowing even more seamless in-wallet token swaps for thousands of users around the world.  #8226; May 2019: HTC, the large consumer electronics company with more than 20 years of innovation, integrated Kyber into its Zion Vault Wallet on EXODUS 1 , the first native web 3.0 blockchain phone, allowing users to easily swap between cryptocurrencies in a decentralized manner without leaving the wallet.  #8226; January 2019: Introduced the Automated Price Reserve (APR) , a capital efficient way for token teams and individuals to market make with low slippage.  #8226; January 2019: The popular Enjin Wallet, a default blockchain DApp on the Samsung S10 and S20 mobile phones, integrated Kyber to enable in-wallet token swaps.  #8226; October 2018: Kyber was a founding member of the WBTC (Wrapped Bitcoin) Initiative and DAO.  #8226; October 2018: Developed the KyberWidget for ERC20 token swaps on any website, with CoinGecko being the first major project to use it on their popular site. ## [Full Article](https://medium.com/@CoinExInstitution/research-report-about-kyber-network-48a479c0d37)</TEXT>

    <TEXT>*Author: Garet Johan, CoinEx Business Ambassador* https://preview.redd.it/skeolnj9s3i51.jpg?width=1600 amp;format=pjpg amp;auto=webp amp;s=42b910784d779dad917d28440c97d108682b1d26 **Based on Singapore** The Ocean Protocol Foundation develops a decentralized data exchange protocol that facilitates the sharing and monetizing of data assets for artificial intelligence (AI) while guaranteeing control, auditability, transparency, and compliance to all actors involved. This becomes Ocean Protocol an ecosystem where users, corporations and others can use their data in a symmetrical and transparent way **Functions** Guarantee control, auditability, transparency, and compliance to all actors involved. Functionality to reconcile spread of data with privacy and the commons. It has infrastructure for service agreements and access control, It has cryptographic proof-of-service and network rewards to incentivize supply of relevant AI data  amp; services. It uses on-chain bounties to ensure long-term sustainability and improvement as a public network. **Problems to be solved** Convert the information available for use by an artificial intelligence without losing control of the data Resolve the tension between wanting more data for better AI models, with the individual right to privacy Incentivize putting data in the commons To be a self-sustaining ecosystem and to improve over the decades **Business:** Ocean incentivizes participants to submit, refer, and make available (provably) quality AI data  amp; services, via a new construction called Curated Proofs Market (CPM). A CPM has two parts: predicted popularity of a dataset/service, and its actual popularity: 1. Cryptographic Proof. The actual popularity is the count of the number of times the dataset/service is delivered or made available. To avoid being gamed, it must be made available in a provable fashion using a cryptographic proof. For example, this may be proof of data availability. 2. Curation Market. This is for predicted popularity, a proxy for relevance. The crowd knows much better than designers of Ocean whether a given dataset/service is relevant; so we harness the power of the crowd via a curation market. This market can be thought of giving reputation to data/services where the actor must  #8220;put their money where their mouth is. #8221; They stake to buy  #8220;shares #8221; (aka drops) in that dataset/service. The earlier that an actor stakes or bets on a given dataset/service, the more drops they get for the amount staked, and in turn the higher the reward. **Business Model:** To avoid people gaming the reward system, only stakeholders provably making high-quality data/services available will be able to reap rewards. Network rewards for a given dataset/service are distributed based on amount of stake in that dataset/service, and its actual popularity. In other words, CPMs instantiate the goals of verification and virality. To the best of our knowledge Whoever bets on the most popular data/service (and makes it available) wins the most rewards. **Economic Stakeholders** https://preview.redd.it/3slbcupcs3i51.jpg?width=954 amp;format=pjpg amp;auto=webp amp;s=75e3103ca384e45938cf98cb2f7c5e09583e1dde **REPUBLIC OF SINGAPORE** Singapore #8217;s goal is to be the pre-eminent hub for data sharing and Al. Towards this vision, Singapore is coordinating relevant ministries and agencies to provide an approved legal and regulatory framework for data sharing by industry and government alike. Newton Circus (DEX) has signed a memorandum of intent (M01) with the Info-communications Media Development Authority of Singapore (IMDA) and PricewaterhouseCoopers Risk Services to foster the formation of data collaboratives: structures where data contributors, data users, solution developers and technology providers collaboratively work together to solve common business challenges In a safe regulatory environment. https://preview.redd.it/pq8diitfs3i51.jpg?width=694 amp;format=pjpg amp;auto=webp amp;s=54bcef8f9b743da0419ef989eb3d3ea032a7a20f From left: Mark Jansen, Data  amp; Analytics Leader at PwC Singapore; Chirdeep Singh Chhabra  amp; Mike Anderson, DEX; Yeong Zee Kin, Assistant Chief Executive of IMDA; and Lance Little, Managing Director, Roche Diagnostics Asia Pacific. With the support of Singapore, several companies are participating in the data sharing use cases. Based on the progress in building the decentralized data exchange protocol, we hope that more companies will embark on the path to unlock their data. https://preview.redd.it/kn5nld1is3i51.jpg?width=1288 amp;format=pjpg amp;auto=webp amp;s=3dd0d91bae44d2d6c451a24a1bb6513dbe218f65 Ocean Protocol should be used to unlock public data and solve important challenges facing the planet. We have partnered with other governments, as well as with non-governmental, academic, and public service initiatives to kick-start use cases centering around the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals and Al for Good. By devoting resources to  #8220;commons #8221; initiatives, Ocean Protocol can become a vital tool for global researchers. https://preview.redd.it/oahghq5ns3i51.jpg?width=1243 amp;format=pjpg amp;auto=webp amp;s=2aa8f74b2272d90a0d4ffae8a2e3fe8380b737f1 https://preview.redd.it/d7nzgtmps3i51.jpg?width=914 amp;format=pjpg amp;auto=webp amp;s=1c04f89ccf8b9b1c370c9ef314954a40c64b12b6 https://preview.redd.it/8j8x1jqqs3i51.jpg?width=916 amp;format=pjpg amp;auto=webp amp;s=753047caa85233d39aa7bc8fe69c08f9fdaabb9f **Team Information** https://preview.redd.it/jn62fb4ts3i51.jpg?width=1161 amp;format=pjpg amp;auto=webp amp;s=e677a2e0d76d3c04d29aa98eaf7de1c1a73f58a1 Bruce Pon is the Founder of BigchainDB and Ocean Protocol, blockchain startups focused on bringing data and AI together since 2013.

Trent McConaghy is a founder of Ocean Protocol. While still an undergraduate in the mid 1990s, he did AI research for national defense. His first startup, ADA, focused on AI for circuit design. Synopsys acquired ADA in 2004. He then did a PhD at KU Leuven on creative AI, which was awarded #1 thesis worldwide in the field. His second startup, Solido, used AI to help drive Moore #8217;s Law. Now, Solido is broadly used for modern chip design, from Apple to Nvidia to Sony. Siemens acquired Solido in 2017. Building on early blockchain work in ascribe and BigchainDB, Trent #8217;s focus is now Ocean Protocol.  #8203; https://preview.redd.it/cdeazk9vs3i51.jpg?width=1198 amp;format=pjpg amp;auto=webp amp;s=1560189dafa26ec2f139eb5b45ac834c9bd788ce Roadmap V2 #8211;2019 (or 2020) After the Commons Marketplace in Tethys, we will have case-specific Marketplaces with Ocean #8217;s collaborators. Web 2.0 integration (for compute and storage services): we will finalize access and integration to AWS, Azure, etc. Improved Service Execution Agreements: staking conditions; slashing conditions; bounty rewards; competition rewards. These will provide a lot of value towards incentives. V3 #8211;2020 Verification and Validation of conditions and service provided via cryptographic proofs. Enables incentives via network rewards. Incentives / network rewards for different actors (including verifiers). Ocean Protocol will be able to reward with tokens against work done. Web 3.0 integration (for example: with other decentralized projects). This is the next logical step after Web 2.0 integration. At this point we might update the roadmap to include multi-chain technology integrations. V4 #8211;TBD Bounties on-chain (DASH style model). Implements a means for the system to not only self-sustain but actually improve over the decades, without guidance by a centralized actor. Clan governance (enable marketplace specific governance, group governance, etc.) for more modular governance models. V5  #8212; TBD Fully permission-less Ocean Protocol. Limits opportunity for gate-keeping by node operators, while still maintaining POA performance levels. Balanced governance: transparent process for updating protocol that balances stakeholder needs (keepers, service providers, curators, validators). 2020 https://preview.redd.it/pv0j8drxs3i51.jpg?width=962 amp;format=pjpg amp;auto=webp amp;s=419efb7633fe2504311ce3484e1e77fdde9a3594 https://preview.redd.it/xdgv7ypys3i51.jpg?width=1181 amp;format=pjpg amp;auto=webp amp;s=a5c4ffadf0969696dc6f551dcb68d7ca7cac272c https://preview.redd.it/jpmvnypzs3i51.jpg?width=1153 amp;format=pjpg amp;auto=webp amp;s=9c96a27d924eaf83f013184c192340c1d33b8563 https://preview.redd.it/02ie8411t3i51.jpg?width=1600 amp;format=pjpg amp;auto=webp amp;s=a3760cf1589966d6e9744cfa12ef6b1c47e285dc **Tokenomics** The Ocean Tokens (Ocean) are used on the Ocean Protocol network as the means of value exchange, to power the protocol and incentivize the keeper nodes of the network. The Ocean Token is inseparable from the Ocean Protocol and Ocean Protocol network. **Earn Ocean Tokens by providing data** Data providers sitting on large sets of latent data can now publish data for sharing using a variety of pricing mechanisms, while maintaining full control over the data and complying with data privacy and compliance regulations. **Earn Ocean Tokens for curating data** Huge amounts of valuable public data sits unused on servers, always at risk of being removed when the funding dries up or when the political climate changes. Ocean Protocol network incentivizes the publication, curation and conservation of public data by expanding the market of buyers. **Earn Ocean Tokens by being a marketplace** Data marketplaces can connect to Ocean Protocol network to leverage their existing data and find new buyers. Meanwhile, developers, corporations, and governments with new ideas can build value-added services on top of the protocol or launch their own data marketplace. **Earn Ocean Tokens for providing network services** Network keepers provide validation and verification services for the network, store the blockchain history of transactions, and serve up relevant services to the community.

Early Acquirors in the Seed and Pre-Launch, and the founding teams have lock-ups ranging from 1.5 #8211;5 years. [ ](https://preview.redd.it/yntd8tz4t3i51.jpg?width=1049 amp;format=pjpg amp;auto=webp amp;s=1796438b7c21c1fb34f4ac6e2666b733d27836ad) In the initial phase, the vast majority of tokens emitted will come from pre-mined tokens for Acquirors, the Foundation and the founding teams. From Q3/2022, the increase in Ocean Token supply will come solely from the network reward. https://preview.redd.it/51am9ns6t3i51.jpg?width=1118 amp;format=pjpg amp;auto=webp amp;s=5255db734e9586d2b9ed98045c3385c177acb861 **Token Supply Inflation** In the first year of the network, the token supply inflation will be 104% as token Acquirors, the Foundation and the founding teams receive allotments of Ocean Tokens. The following years 2020 #8211;2022 will have supply inflation ranging between 17 #8211;21% as the founding teams get their remaining allotments and the network reward kicks in. In 2021, there #8217;s an increase of inflation due to the full network reward activating, to incentivise keepers, data providers and other services to flock to Ocean. The 100% network reward is activated only once the network is ported to a permissionless and fully decentralised sidechain, so the 2021 target date can shift, altering the network reward schedule. After the transition to a decentralised and permissionless chain, the network reward rapidly declines down to 6.8% in 2024 and 5.9% in 2025 when the network reward function becomes the sole source of inflation. By 2030, inflation will be 3.3%, 2040 will give 1.4%, 2050 will give 0.58% and from 2060 onwards 0.28% or less. https://preview.redd.it/58i9kdv8t3i51.jpg?width=841 amp;format=pjpg amp;auto=webp amp;s=f939b4d01d14c4c720d4bb9306003903c8046678 **Achievements** **2019** **March** Raised further funds in a  #8220;network launch #8221; token sale with CoinList, and in April an Initial Exchange Offering with Bittrex International (now Bittrex Global) **May** Co-chaired the Scaling AI for Good track at the UN  #8220;AI for Good Global Summit #8221; in Geneva.

    <TITLE>RESEARCH REPORT ABOUT CREAM FINANCE</TITLE>
    <DATE>2020-10-12 10:32:16</DATE>
    <TEXT>*Author: Gamals Ahmed, CoinEx Business Ambassador*  #8203; https://preview.redd.it/fggzon2c5ns51.jpg?width=698 amp;format=pjpg amp;auto=webp amp;s=cd9e59e7a38ba3eab9a4892d14b4c20f362fd1c0 # ABSTRACT This research report will introduce The C.R.E.A.M. Finance. CREAM Finance ($CREAM) stands for **Crypto Rules Everything Around Me**. The project began with a vision to establish a financial system more accessible than its traditional counterparts did. Cream is a fork of the Compound protocol, a peer-to-peer lending protocol on the Ethereum network, created by Jeffrey Huang. However, it has joined in a strategic partnership with Robert Leshner and Compound Finance, as they have become advisors and early seed investors in the project. Along with $ETH, you can borrow/supply 17 additional assets, including $COMP, $YFI, and $CRV, to name a few. This is nearly double the current assets listed on Compound (9). This is a result of Cream not being located in the US, so they are hampered by less red tape when listing a new asset. Cream also has plans for expansion on to the Binance Smart Chain (BSC) to become one of the first AMM on Binance chain. Cream, like Compound, has created its own token called $CREAM. The token is currently in the  #8220;distribution #8221; phase, where it can be farmed (it #8217;s not easy, but it #8217;s honest work). The $CREAM token will be used for governance participation in the future. # 1.INTRODUCTION The decentralized finance (DeFi) movement has introduced novel solutions in lending, exchanges, derivatives, payments, marketing making, and asset tokenization. All of these innovative services are permissionless and open, meaning anyone with internet access can participate. C.R.E.A.M. Finance will push the boundaries of this new financial system to include as many users and assets as safely possible. * Cream Finance is a decentralized lending and exchange platform featuring **liquidity mining**. * The **CREAM token is the governance token** of the Cream platform. CREAM holders are able to vote on the addition/removal of liquidity pools, supported assets, changes in platform parameters, and more. * Users can earn CREAM tokens by **providing liquidity** in supported pools, as well as **participating in governance voting**. * **C.R.E.A.M. Swap** is the platform #8217;s decentralized exchange protocol, and a code fork of **Balancer**. * A portion of interest as well as transaction fees are collected by the platform, and **distributed** to CREAM token holders as rewards. * Cream Finance #8217;s lending pool and governance is a code fork of **Compound** #8217;s cToken model and governance. ## 1.1 OVERVIEW ABOUT C.R.E.A.M. FINANCE CREAM Finance ($CREAM) stands for Crypto Rules Everything Around Me. The project began with a vision to establish a financial system more accessible than its traditional counterparts did. So CREAM has created an ecosystem that can be linked with other Ethereum platforms to efficiently provide a spectrum of services for its users. The liquidity mining trend, which is currently the most talked-about aspect of the decentralised finance (DeFi) space due to its potential high returns has also helped CREAM establish its popularity and footing in this field. C.R.E.A.M. Finance aims to offer an open and inclusive financial system built on smart contracts. By building smart contracts and deploying them across EVM-compatible blockchains, CREAM aims to broaden the reach of this new financial system to a wider audience, allowing for inter-blockchain composability. C.R.E.A.M. will first launch with an algorithmic money market protocol on Binance Smart Chain (BSC) together with the launch of the BSC mainnet. CREAM Finance is a DeFi system that introduces novel solutions in lending, exchanges, derivatives, payments, market making, and asset tokenization. CREAM Finance went live on August 03, 2020 with its YOLO Alpha launch having $CREAM token reward pool. And within just 4 days of its launched, their LIVE product has accumulated 48 million USD or 121,519 ETH of Total Value Locked. CREAM Finance is a DeFi ecosystem focused on providing lending, exchange, payment, and asset tokenization services. Created as a fork of **Compound Finance**, it also claims to operate a permissionless and open-source protocol so anys other internet participant can be a part of the development of the network, instead of just using it or locking up funds in smart contracts for staking rewards. Financial inclusion is among the team #8217;s primary goals. And the objective is to be able to achieve it without compromising the safety and security of each user and their assets. Since CREAM is established on the Ethereum blockchain, it can take advantage of smart contracts that can be used to run Ethereum Virtual Machines (EVM). Such a set-up also allows the CREAM project to have better composability than other DeFi projects. EVMs can also help community users develop their own decentralized applications (Dapps) on top of the network. However, there is very little detail on the community #8217;s plans for such now. Since 1st September 2020, CREAM has made the switch to Binance Smart Chain (BSC) so as to take advantage of the transaction throughput and cost-efficient servicing available only on the BSC and other similar chains. In addition, linkage with the Binance Chain can provide them with better liquidity through its access to the biggest cryptocurrencies. There has not been any report yet on the audits being done for CREAM #8217;s smart contracts. But according to a recent release they made, they recently hired a security adviser to work on the necessary platform developments. The first monthly payment the team has made to the new adviser totaled to 37,500 CREAM. Some of the more prominent crypto advisers on-board is Robert Leshner, CEO of Compound Finance. Leshner acts as one of the team #8217;s technical advisers. ## 1.2 HISTORY  amp; FOUNDER Jeffrey Huang, the Founder of CREAM Finance, believes in the capacity of cryptocurrencies to create an open and inclusive financial system. And through the help of smart contracts, Huang #8217;s team went on to create a DeFi ecosystem that would link together multiple products and services that many users need today. In recent weeks, the team has been continuously working on expanding its listing and preparing for the launch of its CREAM token. The launch of their beta liquidity mining on 12th August 2020 has been the subject of discussions in some social media platforms. ## 1.3 HOW DOES CREAM WORK? Any loan requires two basic parties, a supplier and a borrower. A supplier, in our case, chooses a token they would like to supply for lending purposes. Once the token is deposited, it goes into a liquidity pool where it may be withdrawn by a borrower, and the supplier immediately starts accruing interest in their supplied token on the next Ethereum block. This is continuously compounded every block thereafter. A borrower must first deposit an asset as collateral before borrowing. Once they have chosen and supplied an asset as collateral, they may choose which token they would like to borrow. As $CREAM is still in the distribution phase, both the supplier and borrower receive a bonus % interest paid in $CREAM for using the protocol. Borrowers can be liquidated by suppliers who call the contract function on loans that are underwater (borrow value is over 100% of collateral value). In essence, using token A to borrow token B, opens a short position of token B. As of writing, there are about 200K $CREAM circulating out of 9mil total supply. The current TVL supplied in CREAM is \~$145mil with \~$55mil being borrowed.  #8203; https://preview.redd.it/bw9aaloh5ns51.png?width=414 amp;format=png amp;auto=webp amp;s=109e8beb06f92b57417d61c780d616b66e85637f ## 1.4 HOW TO FARM CREAM? The $CREAM token can currently be farmed via 2 different methods. The first is supplying/borrowing. As a supplier, you receive interest for lending your assets in the native token you have chosen, as well as a bonus % in $cream. For borrowing, you will have to pay your interest on your borrowed asset, but along with accruing interest to pay back, you also receive a bonus % of $CREAM distribution for being an early user. The second way is being an LP (Liquidity Provider) on either Balancer or Uniswap. You must deposit $ETH and $CREAM into either pool on their respective exchange, to receive an LP token. This LP token can be staked on Cream to earn $CREAM. The APY is much higher here, however, the risk of impermanent loss make LP #8217;ing a much riskier way to farm $CREAM. If you have not LP #8217;ed before please DO YOUR OWN RESEARCH. You can lose money rather easily and quickly if you don #8217;t know what you #8217;re doing. Both of these methods with either stop after some time or have their APY greatly reduced as more users join CREAM and less tokens to be distributed. ## 1.5 CREAM #8217;S LENDING SERVICES The emerging trend of DeFi projects facilitating peer-to-peer lending services enticed the team behind CREAM to work on a protocol that can do something similar. Available assets that users can borrow from the CREAM ecosystem include [BAL](https://boxmining.com/balancer/), [COMP](https://boxmining.com/compound-finance-comp-guide/), ETH, [CRV](https://boxmining.com/curve-finance-crv/), [LEND](https://boxmining.com/aave-lend/), REN, BUSD, USDC, USDT, and [YFI](https://boxmining.com/yfi-yield-farming/). CREAM is looking forward to the launch of BSC. When it is already available, users can take advantage of CREAM #8217;s link with Binance through the BEP2 standard, or pegged tokens, to make the transfers of XRP, BCH, LTC, and TRX much easier. Without having to wrap tokens, CREAM transactions on BSC can be performed faster and more affordably. ## 1.6 CREAM TOKEN AND LIQUIDITY POOLS The CREAM token, i.e. the CREAM platform #8217;s native asset is available on Uniswap and Balancer. As at 25th August 2020, the CREAM token market cap is over $11.8 million, with a circulating supply of 149,927 CREAM. The total supply, however, is at 9 million CREAM. CREAM was recently launched in August 2020 yet the platform already has a total of roughly $48 million in total value locked (TVL). Although it certainly wasn #8217;t able to emulate [Yearn Finance #8217;s ($YFI)](https://boxmining.com/yfi-yield-farming/) meteoric rise, it is still a notable DeFi protocol since it has gained a lot of traction after only being in the market for a few weeks. Since there is a growing number of crypto users participating in liquidity mining or yield farming, the team behind CREAM also launched their own liquidity mining program. The team publishes vital statistics on their [Medium ](https://medium.com/@CreamdotFinance)on any changes or updates to their reward systems and pools. Thus giving users the information they need to decide what plays to make. ## 1.7 COMPARISON WITH OTHER PROJECTS As of now, this coin is not yet listed on the DeFi Pulse statistics. But if we look at the data, the top 16th coin on the list is Bancor which has $32.2M of value locked. And Bancor #8217;s $BNT token already has $170M market cap. On the other hand, Yearn.Finance is top 10th on DeFi Pulse #8217;s list with a whopping $132.7M of value locked. And Yearn.Finance #8217;s $YFI token has $162M market cap. As of 12august, CREAM Finance have a little over $30M of value locked on their YOLO Alpha launch. And has the launched of their Beta Liquidity Mining in the same date. CREAM Finance #8217;s $CREAM was listed on August 12th on the DeFi list of  #8220;coinmarketcap.com #8221; with just having $1.3M market cap.  #8220;ONLY $1.3M market cap. #8221; If you multiply $1.3M by 10, it #8217;s only $13M, which is still ultra-micro cap compared to the other projects of the same level. ## 1.8 THE DOWNSIDE OF CREAM The downside of this project is that the CREAM Finance team doesn #8217;t seem to put much effort on their marketing strategy. With their product market fit, it seems like they don #8217;t want others to know yet about this low market cap gem. Why CREAM Finance team does not make any marketing effort. Maybe they want to focus first on building the perfect product? Maybe they want the big boys to accumulate first before pumping it to the moon? Or maybe they truly believe on the long term success of the project and they #8217;re just confident of its organic growth? # 2 CREAM SWAP: WHAT IS IT? Cream Swap is an automated market maker (AMM) launched on 8th September 2020. This allows users to switch their collateral positions without leaving it. It is meant to be an improvement on the current yield farming model whereby farmers need to utilise token swapping platforms such as Uniswap to convert their cryptocurrencies. This is detrimental to yield farmers because gas fees (which have been skyrocketing due to the number of farmers out there) are incurred, along with trading fees (0.3% in the case of Uniswap). Enter Cream Swap, a fork of [Balancer](https://boxmining.com/balancer/). Yield farmers who create and deposit assets into liquidity pools on Cream Swap #8217;s platform receives Cream Pool Tokens (CRPT). Cream Swap also has lower fees than Uniswap at 0.25%, of which 0.20% is rewarded to liquidity providers and the remaining 0.05% goes to the CREAM network. To encourage users to provide liquidity, CREAM will be distributing 3,000 CREAM tokens daily for the CREAM pairs and 500 CREAM for the other pools. To be eligible for this, users will be required to stake their CRPT tokens for 3 days. The launch of Cream swap has helped CREAM prices to double and CREAM has pushed aside the competition to become the 4th DeFi platform in terms of total value locked. ## 2.1 WHAT IS C.R.E.A.M. SWAP? C.R.E.A.M. Swap is a fork of Balancer, with a Uniswap-like frontend. They like the flexibility of Balancer #8217;s pool customization  #8212; token distribution (up to 8 per pool), swap fees (0 #8211;10%), and enjoy the simplicity of the Uniswap frontend interface. Users who create and deposit into liquidity pools on Swap will receive a proof token named CRPT (Cream Pool Token), similar to how Balancer has BPT and Uniswap has UNI for their liquidity providers. At the start, all exchange fees will be set to 0.25%. Liquidity providers will receive 0.2%, while the other 0.05% will go to the CREAM network. ## 2.2 HOW IS SWAP USEFUL? By enabling users to exchange their collateral positions from the same site, users can easily optimize their yield within the C.R.E.A.M. platform or even outside of our platform by swapping between collateral positions. Besides collateral positions such as crTokens from C.R.E.A.M., Swap can also support tokens from Compound, Yearn, Aave, Balancer, Uniswap, TokenSet, and more. ## 2.3 LIQUIDITY MINING They will launch with more liquidity mining incentives, paid in CREAM tokens. Users on platform can provide liquidity and earn CREAM tokens in addition to trading fees. Only pools from whitelisted tokens will be eligible for CREAM distributions. ## 2.4 TEAM VESTING EXTENDED, NEW MULTISIG HOLDERS Cream have extended the team token vesting schedule, and are announcing three more community leaders that will add to its existing multisig wallet. Their multisig holds 92.5% of the CREAM supply as well as the admin keys to the C.R.E.A.M. protocol smart contracts. ## 2.4.1 TEAM VESTING previously announced in thier August 26th update that thier seed token holders have agreed to further support thier project by doubling the vesting schedule from 2-year vesting with a 6-month cliff to a 4-year vesting with a 1-year cliff. The team behind C.R.E.A.M. has agreed to following this lead and extend the Team token vesting schedule from 2-year vesting with a 6 month cliff to a 4-year vesting with a 6 month cliff. The team believes that the future of CREAM is bright, and are staking tokens behind this belief. With this change, the breakdown of the 9,000,000 CREAM tokens is as follows:  #61623; 10%, 900,000  #8212; Team/Advisors\*, vesting over 4 years, 6 month cliff.  #61623; 10%, 900,000  #8212; Seed, vesting over 4 years, 1 year cliff.  #61623; 20%, 1,800,000  #8212; Liquidity Provider Incentive  #61623; 60%, 5,400,000  #8212; Governance Allocation 25% of the Team/Advisor allocation, 225,000 CREAM, has been allocated to thier technical and security advisor Compound Finance, distributed monthly, 37,500 per month for 6 months. These tokens are legally locked. They will not enter circulation until February 8th, 2021. This is the only exception to the 4 year, 6 month cliff in the Team/Advisors wallet. 8,325,000 of CREAM, or 92.5% of tokens, are in the multisig wallet. # 3 C.R.E.A.M. LAUNCHES ON BINANCE SMART CHAIN Binance already offers an easy path for holders of BTC, ETH, XRP, BCH, LTC and more to transfer their tokens from their native blockchain onto Binance Smart Chain. Today, token holders can simply send their tokens into Binance.com and withdraw BEP20 versions of these coins today. No additional wrapping is required. These communities can soon join in on supply and borrowing tokens as well as the yield farming fun on C.R.E.A.M. ## 3.1 BINANCE SMART CHAIN IS FAST AND AFFORDABLE Building on Binance Smart Chain has many benefits outside of the major. The most immediate benefit that came to many testing out the BSC version of C.R.E.A.M. was clearly the speed and cost advantages of BSC. No longer are you checking gas costs and having to send transactions over existing, slower transactions, you are paying only $0.05-$0.10 per transaction. ## 3.2 SOLVING THE UI/UX PROBLEM WITH THE BINANCE ECOSYSTEM The first version of C.R.E.A.M. on BSC requires web3 integration to use, which means only a small subset of cryptoasset holders will actually be able to use C.R.E.A.M. on BSC. As the Binance ecosystem continues to evolve, they expect that integration of DeFi with the Binance.com and Binance mobile applications will soon make it easier for end users to access DeFi without the web3 complexities. The ability of accessing DeFi via CeFi goes beyond participating in the money legos. For decentralized governance to flourish, barriers to participating in governance needs to be as low as possible. Many mainstream users will care less about privacy and decentralization, but more about ease of use and access. Finally, the Binance ecosystem and its reach of 400,000+ accounts and fiat gateways covering over 170 countries and regions will help get DeFi into mass adoption. ## 3.3 NEW SWAP POOLS  #8212; BULLISH UNI/WETH, UNI/CREAM Just like how our bullish YFI/USDC pool on Swap helps YFI token holders stay more bullish on YFI while providing liquidity, our Bullish UNI/WETH pool will also give bullish UNI holders an incentivized alternative to the existing 50/50 UNI/ETH pool on Uniswap. This new UNI liquidity provider option reduces the amount of impermanent loss that UNI liquidity providers experience. Additionally, our UNI/CREAM pool gives those who hold both UNI and CREAM an opportunity to supply liquidity between those two tokens. At launch, the Bullish UNI/WETH pool will receive 100 CREAM tokens per day for 7 days, and the UNI/CREAM pool will receive 100 CREAM tokens per day for 7 days, from September 18th through September 24th. ## 3.4 UNI TOKEN LISTED In 17th sep 2020, have listed UNI on the C.R.E.A.M. platform. Users can now supply and borrow UNI at app.cream.finance. To celebrate this listing, The CREAM team starts with an additional bonus set of 700 CREAM for providing UNI and borrowing continues for seven days from the date of listing, 100 CREAM per day. This distribution will be based on daily, random snapshots, beginning, September 18th. CREAM distribution for this will occur along with the reward pool for CREAM supply reward, weekly on Wednesdays. Collateral factor for UNI is 20%, meaning for every $100 worth of UNI supplied, users can borrow up to $20 worth of other tokens. # 4 GOVERNANCE BASICS The $CREAM token #8217;s main functionality will be governance within the CREAM DAO (decentralized autonomous organization). The governance dashboard has yet to launch, but if Compound is a preview, token holders will be able to vote on all matters regarding the protocol including updating interest rate models, $CREAM emissions, new token pools, and more. The reserve protocol on CREAM collects part of the interest paid by borrows. The current amount collected is \~$185K. Token holders will vote how this money is distributed/used. # 5 CREAM  amp; V BETA ## 5.1 BETA LIQUIDITY MINING DISTRIBUTION; CRCREAM STAKING MIGRATION CREAM distribution is complete in September 16th. This distribution includes rewards from September 10th through September 16th, plus the crCREAM rewards outstanding. \- Swap liquidity pool rewards have ended for crYETH/crYYCRV, yETH/WETH, yyCRV/USDC on September 14th. \- $SRM: 100 CREAM tokens per day reward pool ends September 17th. ## 5.2 V2 BETA LIQUIDITY MINING PROGRAM Here #8217;s the lay of the land for the v2 of our Beta Liquidity Mining Program, starting Tuesday, August 18th UTC+8. they stopped the v1 program 1 day early from roll out this new program. https://preview.redd.it/j3hqpj9n5ns51.png?width=525 amp;format=png amp;auto=webp amp;s=7f3ef7c87874a2e8885e6817dfec0114915e6c7d # 5.2.1 CREAM REWARD CHANGE HIGHLIGHTS 1. Rewards Increased for: A. CREAM supplied/borrowed (Pool 1.5a)  #8212; 5,000 for the next 7 days beginning from August 18th, up from 2,500. B. Liquidity providers in Balancer (Pool 2a)  #8212; 6,000 for the next 7 days beginning from August 18th, up from 3,000. C. Liquidity providers in Uniswap (Pool 2b)  #8212; 7,000 for the next 7 days beginning from August 18th , up from 3,500. 2. LINK is the winner in the competition between COMP and LINK. LINK token holders will receive bonus tokens in distribution. 3. LEND token holders onto CREAM! 1,500 will be given out over 7 days beginning from August 18th (new pool 1.5b). ## 5.2.2 V2 BETA MINING CONTINUES Users will be rewarded with CREAM tokens based on the USD value of their supply and borrow activity on app.cream.finance (Pool 1). Extra CREAM tokens will be given to those who supply and borrow CREAM (Pool 1.5a), as well as those who supply and borrow LEND (Pool 1.5b). This v2 program will run from Tuesday, August 18th through Monday, August 24th. ## 5.2.3 BETA MINING Cream #8217;s team will test out different permutations of the liquidity mining pools to ensure that they are providing the right incentive that would best benefit the CREAM platform and drive network value. As such, they will take short breaks between each week of beta liquidity pool mining, but still allocate a total of 400,000 CREAM for these beta experiments. It will most likely take longer than a month to complete this phase, but they believe this will ultimately lead to the best product. ## 5.3 SWAP LAUNCH; V5 BETA LIQUIDITY MINING Swap launch is upon us. Swap is the new automated market maker (AMM) product that we are adding to our platform. With Swap, users can easily optimize their yield, adjust their collateral positions, or simply exchange one asset for another. Also, exchange fees generated will be shared between liquidity providers as well as the C.R.E.A.M. network. Swap launch shall be glorious, with plentiful CREAM rewards for all! There will be six pools to start: 1. CREAM/USDC 2. CREAM/WETH 3. crCREAM/crYFI 4. crYETH/crYYCRV 5. yETH/WETH 6. yyCRV/USDC CREAM pairs with USDC and WETH allows for users to trade in and out of two popular tokens. The  #8220;Creamed #8221; pairs of crCREAM/crYFI and crYETH/crYYCRV enables users of C.R.E.A.M. to trade between interest-bearing CREAM and YFI, or from ETH to stablecoins. Finally, the yETH/WETH and yyCRV/USDC pairs enable users to easily go from the yearn LP tokens to the underlying tokens. At launch, liquidity providers to all of these pools can receive heavy CREAM incentives  #8212; 3,000 CREAM tokens per day for the CREAM pairs, and 500 tokens per day for the others. To receive these rewards, users will need to stake CRPT LP tokens, which can be done on the Reward page. Staked LP tokens will be locked for 3 days. ## 5.3.1 LIQUIDITY MINING REWARD THOUGHTS  #61623; With the launch of Swap, they are testing out both high APY rewards for the new Swap pools to attract liquidity. This program is set for 7 days currently, but they will make adjustments quickly and announce them prior to change.  #61623; They are also increasing  #8220;CREAM Supply ONLY #8221; rewards from 1700/day to 5000/day in order to continue our focus on giving CREAM to our loyal token holders.  #61623; They anticipate that new Swap rewards may create a new CREAM liquidity crunch. They stand ready to increase the interest rate model for CREAM in the event there is another liquidity crunch.  #61623; Liquidity providers across Balancer and Uniswap continue to be strong contributors to our network value, and will continue to be rewarded well. Additionally, liquidity providers on Swap will also be handsomely rewarded. ## 5.3.2 V5 BETA LIQUIDITY MINING  #8212; CHANGE HIGHLIGHTS https://preview.redd.it/a4bfnk0s5ns51.png?width=525 amp;format=png amp;auto=webp amp;s=b503892432211cfaa2f1165feb4b38771657d987 **Reward Changes:** * Any supply/borrow (Pool 1)  #8212; Remain the same at 1,000 per day. * CREAM Supply ONLY (Pool 1.5e)  #8212; Increased to 5,000 per day, up from 1,700 per day. * Liquidity providers in Balancer (Pool 2a)  #8212; Remain the same at 1,000 per day. * Liquidity providers in Uniswap (Pool 2b)  #8212; Remain the same at 1,000 per day. * New Swap liquidity pools for CREAM  #8212; 3,000 per day for CREAM/USDC, CREAM/WETH, crCREAM/crYFI. * New Swap liquidity pools for LP positions  #8212; 500 per day for crYETH/crYYCRV, yETH/WETH, yyCRV/USDC. **Pool Changes:** * MTA bonus pool ended on September 6th. * yyCRV bonus pool ended on September 7th. * FTT and SUSHI bonus pools ended on September 8th. * yETH bonus pool ended on September 9th. ## 5.4 V6 BETA LIQUIDITY MINING; BSC LAUNCH It #8217;s an exciting week this week as we begin the launch of liquidity mining on Binance Smart Chain. C.R.E.A.M. launched on BSC on September 12. In addition, they have finally listed on DeFi Pulse, where they currently rank tenth in Total Value Locked in DeFi across all categories. C.R.E.A.M. on BSC now supports BTC, ETH, BNB, BUSD, USDT, LINK, XRP, BCH, LTC. To welcome the Binance community onto C.R.E.A.M., they are kicking off liquidity mining with 1,000 CREAM per day for 7 days, 500 for supply and 500 for borrowing. This launch of liquidity incentives done Monday, September 14th at 10pm UTC+8. ## 5.4.1 LIQUIDITY MINING REWARDS THOUGHTS The launch of Swap has been a success. Across 7 pools they have \~$180M of total value locked (not included in the above 335.7M TVL), with their high volume pairs trading around $10M per day. They are reducing rewards distributed to these pools now that they are past the initial launch period. their move to increase the  #8220;CREAM Supply ONLY #8221; rewards from 1700/day to 5000/day have in fact served to continue their focus on giving CREAM to their loyal token holders while also curing the liquidity crunch on CREAM tokens in the lending marketplace. They are reducing this reward to what they believe is still a strong incentive for supplying CREAM. They have permanently removed the 3-day lock for all staking pools. They will proceed with no longer having any locking mechanism for their staking pools in order to provide their community with the flexibility they have requested. Liquidity providers rewards across Balancer and Uniswap have been significantly reduced as much of our community has moved to provide liquidity on their Swap product. ## 5.4.2 V6 BETA LIQUIDITY MINING  #8212; CHANGE HIGHLIGHTS [ ](https://preview.redd.it/b2gkqs7w5ns51.png?width=525 amp;format=png amp;auto=webp amp;s=fbb34aafca88e50cdd814049100737e948e701f8) Reward Changes: * Any supply/borrow (Pool 1)  #8212; Remain the same at 1,000 per day. * CREAM Supply ONLY (Pool 1.5e)  #8212; Reduced to 2,500 per day, down from 5,000 per day. * Liquidity providers in Balancer (Pool 2a)  #8212; Reduced to 100 per day. * Liquidity providers in Uniswap (Pool 2b)  #8212; Reduced to 100 per day. * Swap liquidity pools for CREAM reduced from 3,000 per day to 1,000 per day for CREAM/USDC, CREAM/WETH, crCREAM/crYFI. * Swap liquidity pools for LP positions in crYETH/crYYCRV, yETH/WETH, yyCRV/USDC end on September 14th. * SRM bonus pool ends on September 17th. * Bullish YFI/USDC pool rewards end on September 18th. # 6 CREAM COMMUNITY **Website:** [https://cream.finance/](https://cream.finance/) **Twitter** (13.3k followers): [https://twitter.com/CreamdotFinance](https://twitter.com/CreamdotFinance) **Discord:** [https://discord.com/invite/8Ms25mV](https://discord.com/invite/8Ms25mV) **Medium:** [https://medium.com/@CreamdotFinance](https://medium.com/@CreamdotFinance) **Telegram** (3.1k subscribers): [https://t.me/CreamdotFinance](https://t.me/CreamdotFinance) # 7 CONCLUSION Cream is well positioned to capture massive value within the crypto-lending space. Instead, of competing with the industry giant that it forked, Compound, it decided to partner with them. The two markets have little overlap in tokens, probably little overlap of user-base. Compound #8217;s proven track record along with Cream #8217;s innovative strategies and UI can only help grow the two. the implications of Cream on Binance #8217;s Smart Chain are MASSIVE. This would be the first major P2P lending protocol with a bridge for ETH and BNB, attracting users from both ecosystems. CREAM is a relative newcomer to this space and we can see that they are continuously building and listing more assets onto their platform. Their newest product, Cream Swap has also brought more users into their platform and consequently boosted the prices of their CREAM token. The team also update the rewards available on their liquidity mining pools and are transparent on their liquidity mining distribution. So be sure to check their Medium where they provide announcements and updates at least once a day. The team behind CREAM are also very responsive on social media in terms of answering people #8217;s queries about them. Finally, considering the inclusion of some very prominent crypto personalities and their linkage with the biggest exchanges and protocols in the space, the future of CREAM looks promising so far. Looking at the service they are offering, it sure seems that it fits into what many cryptocurrency users need from the market. # 8 REFERENCES 1.

    <TITLE>NEAR PROJECT REPORT</TITLE>
    <DATE>2020-10-14 09:56:21</DATE>
    <TEXT>*Author: Gamals Ahmed, CoinEx Business Ambassador* https://preview.redd.it/xbnvecjn71t51.png?width=1164 amp;format=png amp;auto=webp amp;s=acfd141ead035ee156f218eec9fc41288142a922 # ABSTRACT The effects of the web by a number of companies have seduced a large number of users as these companies keep their data to prevent them from searching for alternatives. Likewise, these huge platforms have attracted applications to build their highest ecosystems before either severing access or actively opposing their interests when the applications became so successful. As a result, these walled gardens have effectively hindered innovation and monopolized large sections of the web. After the emergence of blockchain technology and decentralized cryptocurrencies, the need for applications to support decentralization has emerged. Several blockchain-based companies, applications and platforms have appeared in decentralization. In this research report, we will explain the approach adopted by the NEAR decentralization platform in designing and implementing the basic technology for its system. Near is a basic platform for cloud computing and decentralized storage managed by the community, designed to enable the open web for the future. On this web, everything can be created from new currencies to new applications to new industries, opening the door to an entirely new future. # 1. INTRODUCTION The richness of the web is increasing day by day with the combined efforts of millions of people who have benefited from  #8220;innovation without permission #8221; as content and applications are created without asking anyone. this lack of freedom of data has led to an environment hostile to the interests of its participants. And as we explained in the summary previously, web hosting companies have hindered innovation and greatly monopolized the web. In the future, we can fix this by using new technologies to re-enable the permissionless innovation of the past in a way, which creates a more open web where users are free and applications are supportive rather than adversarial to their interests. Decentralization emerged after the global financial crisis in 2008, which created fundamental problems of confidence in the heavily indebted banking system. Then the decentralized financial sector based on Blockchain technology has emerged since 2009. Decentralized Blockchain technology has made it easy for decentralized digital currencies like Bitcoin to exchange billions of dollars in peer-to-peer transfers for a fraction of the price of a traditional banking system. This technology allows participants in the over $ 50 billion virtual goods economy to track, own and trade in these commodities without permission. It allows real-world goods to cross into the digital domain, with verified ownership and tracking just like that of the digital. By default, the Internet where freedom of data enables innovation will lead to the development of a new form of software development. On this web, developers can quickly create applications from open state components and boost their efforts by using new business models that are enabled from within the program itself rather than relying on parasitic relationships with their users. This not only accelerates the creation of applications that have a more honest and cooperative relationship with its users, but also allows the emergence of completely new business built on them. To enable these new applications and the open web, it needs the appropriate infrastructure. The new web platform cannot be controlled by a single entity and its use is not limited due to insufficient scalability. It should be decentralized in design like the web itself and supported by a community of distributors widely so that the value they store cannot be monitored, modified or removed without permission from the users who store this value on their behalf. A new decentralization technology (**Blockchain**), which has facilitated decentralized digital currencies like Bitcoin, has made billions of dollars in peer-to-peer transfers at a fraction of the price of the traditional banking system. This technology allows participants in the $ 50 billion + virtual goods economy to track, own and trade in these goods without permission. It allows real-world goods to cross into the digital domain, with verified ownership and tracking just like that of the digital. Although the cost of storing data or performing a calculation on the Ethereum blockchain is thousands and millions of times higher than the cost of performing the same functionality on Amazon Web Services. A developer can always create a  #8220;central #8221; app or even a central currency for a fraction of the cost of doing the same on a decentralized platform **because a decentralized platform, by definition, will have many iterations in its operations and storage.** Bitcoin can be thought of as the first, very basic, version of this global community-run cloud, though it is primarily used only to store and move the Bitcoin digital currency. Ethereum is the second and slightly more sophisticated version, which expanded the basic principles of Bitcoin to create a more general computing and storage platform, though it is a raw technology, which hasn #8217;t achieved meaningful mainstream adoption. ## 1.1 WHY IS IT IMPORTANT TO PAY THE EXTRA COST TO SUPPORT DECENTRALIZATION? Because some elements of value, for example bits representing digital currency ownership, personal identity, or asset notes, are very sensitive. While in the central system, the following players can change the value of any credits they come into direct contact with: 1. The developer who controls the release or update of the application #8217;s code 2. The platform where the data is stored 3. The servers which run the application #8217;s code Even if none of these players intend to operate with bad faith, the actions of governments, police forces and hackers can easily turn their hands against their users and censor, modify or steal the balances they are supposed to protect. A typical user will trust a typical centralized application, despite its potential vulnerabilities, with everyday data and computation. Typically, only banks and governments are trusted sufficiently to maintain custody of the most sensitive information  #8212; balances of wealth and identity. But these entities are also subject to the very human forces of hubris, corruption and theft. Especially after the 2008 global financial crisis, which demonstrated the fundamental problems of confidence in a highly indebted banking system. And governments around the world apply significant capital controls to citizens during times of crisis. After these examples, it has become a truism that hackers now own most or all of your sensitive data. These decentralized applications operate on a more complex infrastructure than today #8217;s web but they have access to an instantaneous and global pool of currency, value and information that today #8217;s web, where data is stored in the silos of individual corporations, cannot provide. ## 1.2 THE CHALLENGES OF CREATING A DECENTRALIZED CLOUD A community-run system like this has very different challenges from centralized  #8220;cloud #8221; infrastructure, which is running by a single entity or group of known entities. For example: 1. It must be both inclusive to anyone and secure from manipulation or capture. 2. Participants must be fairly compensated for their work while avoiding creating incentives for negligent or malicious behavior. 3. It must be both game theoretically secure so good actors find the right equilibrium and resistant to manipulation so bad actors are actively prevented from negatively affecting the system. # 2. NEAR NEAR is a global community-run computing and storage cloud which is organized to be permissionless and which is economically incentivized to create a strong and decentralized data layer for the new web. Essentially, it is a platform for running applications which have access to a shared  #8212; and secure  #8212; pool of money, identity and data which is owned by their users. More technically, it combines the features of partition-resistant networking, serverless compute and distributed storage into a new kind of platform. NEAR is a community-managed, decentralized cloud storage and computing platform, designed to enable the open web in the future. It uses the same core technology for Bitcoin and Blockchain. On this web, everything can be created from new currencies to new applications to new industries, opening the door to an entirely new future. NEAR is a decentralized community-run cloud computing and storage platform, which is designed to enable the open web of the future. On this web, everything from new currencies to new applications to new industries can be created, opening the door to a brand new future. NEAR is a scalable computing and storage platform with the potential to change how systems are designed, how applications are built and how the web itself works. It is a complex technology allow developers and entrepreneurs to easily and sustainably build applications which reap the benefits of decentralization and participate in the Open Web while minimizing the associated costs for end users. NEAR creates the only community-managed cloud that is strong enough to power the future of the open web, as NEAR is designed from the ground up to deliver intuitive experiences to end users, expand capacity across millions of devices, and provide developers with new and sustainable business models for their applications. The NEAR Platform uses a token  #8212; also called  #8220;NEAR #8221;. This token allows the users of these cloud resources, regardless of where they are in the world, to fairly compensate the providers of the services and to ensure that these participants operate in good faith. ## 2.1 WHY NEAR? Through focus, we find that Platforms based on blockchain technologies like Bitcoin and Ethereum have made great progress and enriched the world with thousands of innovative applications spanning from games to decentralized financing. However, these original networks and none of the networks that followed were not able to bridge the gap towards mainstream adoption of the applications created above them and do not provide this type of standard that fully supports the web. This is a result of two key factors: 1. System design 2. Organization design System design is relevant because the technical architecture of other platforms creates substantial problems with both usability and scalability which have made adoption nearly impossible by any but the most technical innovators. End-users experience 97 #8211;99% dropoff rates when using applications and developers find the process of creating and maintaining their applications endlessly frustrating. Fixing these problems requires substantial and complex changes to current protocol architectures, something which existing organizations haven #8217;t proven capable of implementing. Instead, they create multi-year backlogs of specification design and implementation, which result in their technology falling further and further behind. NEAR #8217;s platform and organization are architected specifically to solve the above-mentioned problems. The technical design is fanatically focused on creating the world #8217;s most usable and scalable decentralized platform so global-scale applications can achieve real adoption. The organization and governance structure are designed to rapidly ship and continuously evolve the protocol so it will never become obsolete. ## 2.1.1 Features, which address these problems: **1. USABILITY FIRST** The most important problem that needs to be addressed is how to allow developers to create useful applications that users can use easily and that will capture the sustainable value of these developers. **2. End-User Usability** Developers will only build applications, which their end users can actually use. NEAR #8217;s  #8220;progressive security #8221; model allows developers to create experiences for their users which more closely resemble familiar web experiences by delaying onboarding, removing the need for user to learn  #8220;blockchain #8221; concepts and limiting the number of permission-asking interactions the user must have to use the application. **1. Simple Onboarding:** NEAR allows developers to take actions on behalf of their users, which allows them to onboard users without requiring these users to provide a wallet or interact with tokens immediately upon reaching an application. Because accounts keep track of application-specific keys, user accounts can also be used for the kind of  #8220;Single Sign On #8221; (SSO) functionality that users are familiar with from the traditional web (eg  #8220;Login with Facebook/Google/Github/etc #8221;). **2. Easy Subscriptions:** Contract-based accounts allow for easy creation of subscriptions and custom permissioning for particular applications. **3. Familiar Usage Styles:** The NEAR economic model allows developers to pay for usage on behalf of their users in order to hide the costs of infrastructure in a way that is in line with familiar web usage paradigms. **4. Predictable Pricing:** NEAR prices transactions on the platform in simple terms, which allow end-users to experience predictable pricing and less cognitive load when using the platform. ## 2.1.2 Design principles and development NEAR #8217;s platform **1. Usability:** Applications deployed to the platform should be seamless to use for end users and seamless to create for developers. Wherever possible, the underlying technology itself should fade to the background or be hidden completely from end users. Wherever possible, developers should use familiar languages and patterns during the development process. Basic applications should be intuitive and simple to create while applications that are more robust should still be secure. **2. Scalability:** The platform should scale with no upper limit as long as there is economic justification for doing so in order to support enterprise-grade, globally used applications. **3. Sustainable Decentralization:** The platform should encourage significant decentralization in both the short term and the long term in order to properly secure the value it hosts. The platform  #8212; and community  #8212; should be widely and permissionlessly inclusive and actively encourage decentralization and participation. To maintain sustainability, both technological and community governance mechanisms should allow for practical iteration while avoiding capture by any single parties in the end. **4. Simplicity:** The design of each of the system #8217;s components should be as simple as possible in order to achieve their primary purpose. Optimize for simplicity, pragmatism and ease of understanding above theoretical perfection. ## 2.2 HOW NEAR WORKS? NEAR #8217;s platform provides a community-operated cloud infrastructure for deploying and running decentralized applications. It combines the features of a decentralized database with others of a serverless compute platform. The token, which allows this platform to run also, enables applications built on top of it to interact with each other in new ways. Together, these features allow developers to create censorship resistant back-ends for applications that deal with high stakes data like money, identity, assets, and open-state components, which interact seamlessly with each other. These application back-ends and components are called  #8220;smart contracts, #8221; though we will often refer to these all as simply  #8220;applications #8221; here. The infrastructure, which makes up this cloud, is created from a potentially infinite number of  #8220;nodes #8221; run by individuals around the world who offer portions of their CPU and hard drive space  #8212; whether on their laptops or more professionally deployed servers. Developers write smart contracts and deploy them to this cloud as if they were deploying to a single server, which is a process that feels very similar to how applications are deployed to existing centralized clouds. Once the developer has deployed an application, called a  #8220;smart contract #8221;, and marked it unchangeable ( #8220;immutable #8221;), the application will now run for as long as at least a handful of members of the NEAR community continue to exist. When end users interact with that deployed application, they will generally do so through a familiar web or mobile interface just like any one of a million apps today. In the central cloud hosted by some companies today like: Amazon or Google, developers pay for their apps every month based on the amount of usage needed, for example based on the number of requests created by users visiting their webpages. The NEAR platform similarly requires that either users or developers provide compensation for their usage to the community operators of this infrastructure. Like today #8217;s cloud infrastructure, NEAR prices usage based on easy to understand metrics that aren #8217;t heavily influenced by factors like system congestion. Such factors make it very complicated for developers on alternative blockchain-based systems today. In the centralized cloud, the controlling corporation makes decisions unilaterally. NEAR community-run cloud is decentralized so updates must ultimately be accepted by a sufficient quorum of the network participants. Updates about its future are generated from the community and subject to an inclusive governance process, which balances efficiency and security. In order to ensure that the operators of nodes  #8212; who are anonymous and potentially even malicious  #8212; run the code with good behavior, they participate in a staking process called  #8220;Proof of Stake #8221;. In this process, they willingly put a portion of value at risk as a sort of deposit, which they will forfeit if it is proven that they have operated improperly. ## 2.2.1 Elements of the NEAR #8217;s Platform The NEAR platform is made up of many separate elements. Some of these are native to the platform itself while others are used in conjunction with or on top of it. **1. THE NEAR TOKEN** NEAR token is the fundamental native asset of the NEAR ecosystem and its functionality is enabled for all accounts. Each token is a unique digital asset similar to Ether, which can be used to: a) Pay the system for processing transactions and storing data. b) Run a validating node as part of the network by participating in the staking process. c) Help determine how network resources are allocated and where its future technical direction will go by participating in governance processes. The NEAR token enables the economic coordination of all participants who operate the network plus it enables new behaviors among the applications which are built on top of that network. **2. OTHER DIGITAL ASSETS** The platform is designed to easily store unique digital assets, which may include, but aren #8217;t limited to: * **Other Tokens:** Tokens bridged from other chains ( #8220;wrapped #8221;) or created atop the NEAR Platform can be easily stored and moved using the underlying platform. This allows many kinds of tokens to be used atop the platform to pay for goods and services.  #8220;Stablecoins, #8221; specific kinds of token which are designed to match the price of another asset (like the US Dollar), are particularly useful for transacting on the network in this way. * **Unique Digital Assets:** Similar to tokens, digital assets (sometimes called  #8220;Non Fungible Tokens #8221; (NFTs) ranging from in-game collectibles to representations of real-world asset ownership can be stored and moved using the platform. **3. THE NEAR PLATFORM** The core platform, which is made up of the cloud of community-operated nodes, is the most basic piece of infrastructure provided. Developers can permissionlessly deploy smart contracts to this cloud and users can permissionlessly use the applications they power. Applications, which could range from consumer-facing games to digital currencies, can store their state (data) securely on the platform. This is conceptually similar to the Ethereum platform. Operations that require an account, network use, or storage at the top of the platform require payment to the platform in the form of transaction fees that the platform then distributes to its community from the authentication contract. These operations could include creating new accounts, publishing new contracts, implementing code by contract and storing or modifying data by contract. As long as the rules of the protocol are followed, any independent developer can write software, which interfaces with it (for example, by submitting transactions, creating accounts or even running a new node client) without asking for anyone #8217;s permission first. **4. THE NEAR DEVELOPMENT SUITE** Set of tools and reference implementations created to facilitate its use by those developers and end users who prefer them. These tools include: * **NEAR SDKs:** NEAR platform supports (**Rust** and **AssemblyScript**) languages to write smart contracts. To provide a great experience for developers, NEAR has a full SDK, which includes standard data structures, examples and testing tools for these two languages. * **Gitpod for NEAR:** NEAR uses existing technology **Gitpod** to create zero time onboarding experience for developers. Gitpod provides an online  #8220;Integrated Development Environment #8221; (IDE), which NEAR customized to allow developers to easily write, test and deploy smart contracts from a web browser. * **NEAR Wallet:** A wallet is a basic place for developers and end users to store the assets they need to use the network. NEAR Wallet is a reference implementation that is intended to work seamlessly with the progressive security model that lets application developers design more effective user experiences. It will eventually include built-in functionality to easily enable participation by holders in staking and governance processes on the network. * **NEAR Explorer:** To aid with both debugging of contracts and the understanding of network performance, Explorer presents information from the blockchain in an easily digestible web-based format. * **NEAR Command Line Tools:** The NEAR team provides a set of straightforward command line tools to allow developers to easily create, test and deploy applications from their local environments. All of these tools are being created in an open-source manner so they can be modified or deployed by anyone. # 3. ECONOMIC Primarily economic forces drive the ecosystem, which makes up the NEAR platform. This economy creates the incentives, which allow participants permissionlessly organize to drive the platform #8217;s key functions while creating strong disincentives for undesirable, irresponsible or malicious behavior. In order for the platform to be effective, these incentives need to exist both in the short term and in the long term. **The NEAR platform is a market among participants interested in two aspects:** * **On the supply side**, certification contract operators and other core infrastructure must be motivated to provide these services that make up the community cloud. * **On the demand side**, platform developers and end-users who pay for their use need to be able to do so in a simple, clear and consistent way that helps them. Further, economic forces can also be applied to support the ecosystem as a whole. They can be used at a micro level to create new business models by directly compensating the developers who create its most useful applications. They can also be used at a macro level by coordinating the efforts of a broader set of ecosystem participants who participate in everything from education to governance. ## 3.1 NEAR ECONOMY DESIGN PRINCIPLES NEAR #8217;s overall system design principles are used to inform its economic design according to the following interpretations: **1. Usability:** End users and developers should have predictable and consistent pricing for their usage of the network. Users should never lose data forever. **2. Scalability:** The platform should scale at economically justified thresholds. **3. Simplicity:** The design of each of the system #8217;s components should be as simple as possible in order to achieve their primary purpose. **4. Sustainable Decentralization:** The barrier for participation in the platform as a validating node should be set as low as possible in order to bring a wide range of participants. Over time, their participation should not drive wealth and control into the hands of a small number. Individual transactions made far in the future must be at least as secure as those made today in order to safeguard the value they modify. ## 3.2 ECONOMIC OVERVIEW The NEAR economy is optimized to provide developers and end users with the easiest possible experience while still providing proper incentives for network security and ecosystem development. **Summary of the key ideas that drive the system:** * **Thresholded Proof of Stake:** Validating node operators provide scarce and valuable compute resources to the network. In order to ensure that the computations they run are correct, they are required to  #8220;stake #8221; NEAR tokens, which guarantee their results. If these results are found to be inaccurate, the staker loses their tokens. This is a fundamental mechanism for securing the network. The threshold for participating in the system is set algorithmically at the lowest level possible to allow for the broadest possible participation of validating nodes in a given  #8220;epoch #8221; period ( #189; of a day). * **Epoch Rewards:** Node operators are paid for their service a fixed percentage of total supply as a  #8220;security #8221; fee of roughly 4.5% annualized. This rate targets sufficient participation levels among stakers in order to secure the network while balancing with other usage of NEAR token in the ecosystem. * **Protocol treasury:** In addition to validators, protocol treasury received a 0.5% of total supply annually to continuously re-invest into ecosystem development. * **Transaction Costs:** Usage of the network consumes two separate kinds of resources  #8212; instantaneous and long term. Instantaneous costs are generated by every transaction because each transaction requires the usage of both the network itself and some of its computation resources. These are priced together as a mostly-predictable cost per transaction, which is paid in NEAR tokens. * **Storage Costs:** Storage is a long term cost because storing data represents an ongoing burden to the nodes of the network. Storage costs are covered by maintaining minimum balance of NEAR tokens on the account or contract. This provides indirect mechanism of payment via inflation to validators for maintaining contract and account state on their nodes. * **Inflation:** Inflation is determined as combination of payouts to validators and protocol treasury minus the collected transaction fees and few other NEAR burning mechanics (like name auction). Overall the maximum inflation is 5%, which can go down over time as network gets more usage and more transactions fees are burned. It #8217;s possible that inflation becomes negative (total supply decreases) if there is enough fees burned. * **Scaling Thresholds:** In a network, which scales its capacity relative to the amount of usage it receives, the thresholds, which drive the network to bring on additional capacity are economic in nature. * **Security Thresholds:** Some thresholds, which provide for good behavior among participants are set using economic incentives. For example,  #8220;Fishermen #8221; (described separately). [Full Report](https://medium.com/@CoinExInstitution/near-project-report-8b360b6c9b43)</TEXT>
