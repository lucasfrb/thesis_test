    <TEXT>I enjoyed it on the first listen through, but the second listen really did it for me. I described it to a friend as not being able to see the  #8220;song for the notes #8221; on the first listen. There #8217;s just so much to take in. But the second time round and every listen since, the songs are just so friggin good.</TEXT>

    <TITLE>Did not realise what a difference charcoal makes!</TITLE>
    <DATE>2020-09-19 08:18:47</DATE>
    <TEXT>My first cook on my offset turned out great, but it took about twice as long as it should have because I was using what looked to be fancy charcoal from b amp;q. It was all tiny shreds and dust and would reach temp or hold temp before it burnt to ash. I #8217;m now using what seems to be decent charcoal, bigger more sturdy lumps and my cooker is running so consistently. Pro tip: the charcoal in the big yellow bag from the range is cheap af and somehow fantastic. My gf bought it for me assuming charcoal is charcoal, and it #8217;s the best even though the packaging looks like a cheap knock off. Highly recommend</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I #8217;m cooking on a cheap offset cooker. Tepio brand. It #8217;s my first foray into this stuff so didn #8217;t want to spend too much, but this thing is loads of fun and making real good stuff for me so far. I #8217;ve only done a pork shoulder and ribs thus far, but hoping to get another cook of some kind done before the good weather ends for the year in Cardiff.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>That seems to be the thread favourite. Will definitely get a bag for my next cook. I was worried how long I #8217;d be able to get the Range charcoal cos the brand doesn #8217;t look very official. Big K seems to be everywhere  #128077;</TEXT>

    <TITLE>Does anyone have any tips or recommended products for cleaning your smoker?</TITLE>
    <DATE>2020-09-22 13:23:55</DATE>
    <TEXT>I #8217;m using a cheap offset smoker, only two cooks in but I bloody love it. I want to keep it clean and rust free and in as good condition as I can because I like to take care of my things, but also because where I live (Wales) the weather is so often shit that there will be long periods of time when I can #8217;t cook on it. It #8217;ll just be sitting under it #8217;s cover, Hoping it doesn #8217;t rust or mold etc. At the moment I #8217;m just scrapping it down, removing ash, soap and watering with a kitchen sponge/scourer then paper towel drying and leaving to air dry as long as possible before covering. Any tips and tricks you can recommend? And does anyone know of more reusable products to use instead of kitchen sponges? Every clean kills a new sponge/scourer and half a roll of kitchen towels and it feels wasteful.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I mixed salt, pepper, cayenne, sugar, tomato paste and olive oil into a sort of glaze-y smear-y paste, applied that and then smoked for 3-4 hours at 225. I saw a recipe online that suggested shorted cook time, but I think cos it was at the far end of the cooker and also it #8217;s only my second cook it took a little longer. It was really good once it was done tho! I cut the florets into little bites and put some buffalo sauce along side for dipping, like veggie smoked wings.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Haha, to be totally honest with you, the cauliflower was 100% to justify cooking ribs to my vegetarian girlfriend. But it was very nice regardless  #128514;</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I was actually looking online for some gasket tape that I saw recommended in YouTube for cheaper cookers, but this sounds like a great idea. I #8217;m trying to practice and work my way up to bigger cooks and will definitely be doing this! Is there any easily available cut of beef you #8217;d recommend as a stepping stone to brisket? Having looked at sourcing brisket in the U.K. it #8217;s pretty expensive and harder to come by, so I want to practice on something a bit smaller/cheaper but will give me a similar process/result.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>That is a solid point about the gasket tape, I #8217;ll definitely take your time foil approach, from your video it doesn #8217;t look to difficult to rig up! I #8217;ve just followed your channel! Good to see some U.K. representation on there! That brisket jiggle in episode 1 is phenomenal, very much looking forward to seeing the process for that one!</TEXT>
