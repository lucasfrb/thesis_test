    <TEXT>Yes the designs are our own. Those STLs are ripoffs someone made a little while ago and started selling on Amazon. If you look closesly ours are actually pretty different. These are much lower quality. They don't really fit the cardboard pieces that well and they aren't very nice. They do resemble ours somewhat.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Yeah I am in that sub as well. This one just seems like it has more of the creative-minded side of board games in it. But yeah popular games that can be enhanced well with 3D items. We actually do make an azul item, but we could definitely find other things to make. For Terraforming Mars, we were never really able to find things we felt could significantly improve gameplay. All the other ones are new ideas for me so I'll definitely check them out. Thanks a lot!</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Yeah for sure. That's good advice. The reason that we have them as flat is because each square is traversable so characters can actually stand on our pieces. Too much design on top makes it to where a character can't stand on them making it so that gamers can't use them while playing. Also, most of the pieces have cut-outs on top to incorporate the normal cardboard pieces that come with the game.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>That sounds awesome and could definitely be a future avenue for our company. Unfortunately right now we are extremely small with only me and two others running it. Only one of us is adept at designing and one has some experience to make preliminary models of pieces. We don't have the workforce and speed to do too many models at a time. Currently we are trying to choose one maybe two new games to design for to expand our catalogue (right now we only make pieces for Gloomhaven and Imperial Assault). What you're saying is definitely very interesting, however, and hopefully at some point in the future we can look into this as a serious potential avenue for us. Thanks!</TEXT>

Do you thin that we should try to make a second Gloomhaven set, adding traps and other pieces that we don't yet make? That is the biggest thing we are considering at the moment, but we aren't sure if we'd get any repurchases from people who already have our first set.</TEXT>

    <DATE>2020-02-26 18:53:10</DATE>
    <TEXT>I just finished a couple FE games which honestly I can't recommend enough, but it's time to get through some Zelda games. My first Zelda game was BOTW and I loved it so much I knew I had to play other ones. I had started Twilight Princess a while back and now I'm going to finish it. Just picked up the Master Sword a couple nights ago. Once I beat this I will play OcarinaOT which I already have, then hope to buy Majora's Mask. By that point I imagine BOTW2 will have come out and I will play it. Is Majora's Mask worth playing at this point? It seems pretty awesome but I haven't really heard how good or bad people think it is. These are the only Zelda games I really hope to play anytime soon but I'm pretty excited. Maybe after these (or some at the same time) I will try to play FE Awakening.</TEXT>

I remember playing it a little bit at a friend's house a while back and I enjoyed it some then even if I didn't really understand it. I think I'll give it a go but I'm definitely way more excited for OOT as I've heard it's one of the greatest games of all time. Thanks for the insight!</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I would suggest smash. Super awesome improvement on an awesome series. You'll find Odyssey's playthrough to be much like BOTW but much less fun. I've beat Zelda twice now without having gotten past the second world on Odyssey. It just really isn't that exciting, and if you've played Galaxy it is a huge letdown. Smash's story mode isn't the greatest, but it has a huge variety of game options and is just really fun to piddle a couple of hours away on without getting too sucked in. MK8 doesn't really add anything at all new to the series so would not recommend that at all. For a non-hyper immersive AAA game, Smash is definitely the one I'd go with here.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>DLC for BOTW is a great option for awesome new challenges and features. Pok #233;mon Let's Go is also pretty fun (haven't played Sword or Shield yet). Odyssey is not my favorite, but I've seen others enjoy it. I would not recommend FE Three Houses. One game that I played for over 100 hours is Sid Meier's Civilization. It's pretty interesting and absorbing for a few playthroughs. Mostly when I'm on my switch, I'm either playing Smash or replaying BOTW so you definitely already have the best ones.</TEXT>

Not sure if you like Pok #233;mon at all, but Let's go Pikachu was my first experience and it was pretty awesome. Nice and chill, but with fun action. Animal Crossing is fun too though for a little while. Get's old quick for me though.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Splatoon 2 is a pretty good game, but it really didn't hold me for very long. Maybe about 20 total play hours. I absolutely loved the BOTW dlc. Master Sword Trials are easily the most challenging thing in the whole game. Challenges for each champion add extra story and several more hours of content. Not to mention the numerous new side quests for awesome different armors from other games. Master Mode was really cool for me and warranted another playthrough of the game. Overall Splatoon is a fun game, but I would definitely recommend BOTW DLC. Well worth the $20 for me.</TEXT>

    <TITLE>Unit Leveling</TITLE>
    <DATE>2020-08-30 17:14:28</DATE>
    <TEXT>I know there was someone on here a while back asking about the best strategy for leveling units really high while playing normal mode. The recommended strategies were using the fallen allies xp spots over and over on maps or even just getting one xp point at a time. Once your unit gets about 20 levels higher than an enemy, you only get one xp per kill (even with an experience gem). I have found that you can level your unit much faster if you get their faith skill high enough to have heal. If you take the unit you want to level along with one more unit that can tank some hits into an auxiliary battle you can just heal the tank over and over. This yields about 80 xp per heal or 130 per heal if you have an experience gem. If your unit also gets restore, monster battles can give you an opportunity to do that as well. If you can get the right class to give double the faith magic uses, you can pull about 2500 xp per stage. It takes about 30 turns, but it #8217;s much better than getting 35 per stage solo running. I don #8217;t know if this will help anyone, but I figured I #8217;d put it out there just in case.</TEXT>
