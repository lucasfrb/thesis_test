    <TITLE>How do accents happen?</TITLE>
    <DATE>2020-03-11 12:39:31</DATE>
    <TEXT>Like if you take the UK for example... It had around 37 dialects and I'd wager it has even more accents. For example Stockton-on-Tees is right next to Middlesbrough and they sound faintly different. But why do they sound different? You have people living in close proximity to each other, so why don't they all sound like each other? Leeds is about 20 minutes away from Bradford, so why don't they sound the same? Newcastle is next to Gateshead, why don't they sound the same? Middlesbrough is close to Hartlepool etc. You pick up an accent from living with people with the same accent, so why are there so many accents?</TEXT>

    <TITLE>What's the difference between rock and metal?</TITLE>
    <DATE>2020-03-12 15:31:14</DATE>
    <TEXT>Like it isn't just "more distortion" because a lot of rock bands use heavier distortion such as Arctic Monkeys earlier stuff and Rise Against. It isn't just being darker either because a lot of rock bands are dark. Listen to Pink Floyd's The Wall for example. Metal isn't more complicated because progressive and psychedelic rock can be very complex and a lot of metal is very basic e.g Black Sabbath and Megadeath. Rock isn't happier sounding, because a lot of metal is happy. Power metal, hair metal etc. So what actually is the difference? What separates them?</TEXT>

I'm aware both are available in each country, but why do Americans prefer belly bacon? There's less meat and more fat. Back bacon is all meat with a little bit of fat around the side.

    <TITLE>Why does mainstream music constantly change genre?</TITLE>
    <DATE>2020-03-13 13:10:11</DATE>
    <TEXT>Pianists used to be the rockstars of the 1750's-1850s. Then it changed to Violinists. In the 60's and 70's it was all about Rock and Roll and boy bands. Then there was the Hair Metal scene in the 80's. That was short lived and soon replaced with Grunge. Grunge died with Kurt Cobain and then Nu-Metal and Brit Pop took over. Then we had Third Wave Ska with bands like No Doubt. That became unpopular. Then in the mid 2000's we had hip hop taking over with Eminem getting to the height of his career. That was replaced with DJ's like Example, David Quetta, Chase and Status, Calvin Harris etc. Then two music genres became mainstreme, Dubstep and Metalcore. Both were short lived and now we have Trap and Cloud Rap. Why does this happen? Like not only does something become massively popular, it becomes uncool the moment it's not in the spotlight anymore. It's not cool to listen to Nu-Metal anymore. It's not cool to listen to Dubstep anymore etc.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>It's like I've conditioned myself to write all of my music in Cm. You could say "learn other scales" but that's assuming I don't know any other scales, which I do. I just can't stop playing in Cm. It's a trap I keep falling into. It's like stealth archer in Skyrim. Everything just eventually goes back to my comfort zone (C minor). It's the same with chords. I keep going back to E5 | Cmaj7 | Gsus2 | D5 On guitar I keep getting stuck using the G minor scale. If I'm not writing music on piano, I keep going back to F #252;r Elise. How do I escape my comfort zone? It's making my music suffer and sound samey. Sometimes I don't even notice. I'll play something like Gm | A#/F | D#maj7sus | Dsus and then be like "Fuck, that's in C minor again!"</TEXT>

    <TITLE>Are there any similar artists to Aristotle Roufanis?</TITLE>
    <DATE>2020-03-19 01:07:13</DATE>
    <TEXT>In art galleries his photos are displayed on a massive scale, sometimes more than 10ft across; which is quite modest when compared to the resolution of his photos. His work can be shown at 100ft wide without losing much quality. [They're cityscapes designed to be drowned in.](https://photos.lensculture.com/large/2b14e2a2-15a5-43b5-ad24-6edc7a204cbd.jpg) They're so big that individually pinpricks of light can be enlarged, explored and lived inside. [Each lit window is a person.]( https://www.bjp-online.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/yTt2o.jpeg) They have lives, possessions, individuality. But never are two lights on next to each other. Never do you get a sense of connection, just this strange solidarity of a few specs of life. [Each alone in a void.](https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/AnzQ089ftT993GAtU1f6RDdpdRPb3NF_8NJrqOmztX5o-zL6lSqwv3hXUh6Bzjh-iiA_yJG9iwgbOA9F9cfqhseUxA=s900-c) [If you look at this photo, you'll soon realise it's impossible.](https://i.pinimg.com/originals/cf/59/d7/cf59d7a4c3a835e1f229dcf28fad07f0.jpg) Paris has never been this dark. Not even blackouts are this kind of quiet. Roufanis's compositions are thousands of photographs taken over months, painstakingly stitched together and digital edited to create an immense, seamless collage of emptiness. Roufanis is communicating a feeling. Something that everyone can relate to. A sense of being lost and swallowed up in someone far bigger than you. [They don't feel alive, but intimate in a way that mixes solidarity with empathy](https://photos.lensculture.com/large/807e31c1-7e85-43ac-82f0-998c180d34ca.jpg)</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I would date someone who's transgender or genderfluid. That doesn't make me pansexual, I'm still bisexual. Except from a few rare exceptions such as intersex people, most people have a binary genetic sex. Either genetically male or genetically female. There's dozens of gender *identities* but that isn't the case with what your biological sex is. Even if you are transgender. You are a male TRANSitioning into a female or vice versa. Transitioning genders. Transgender. To me, pansexuality seems arbitrary. It sounds like "I'm not bisexual, I'm different. I need to differentiate myself." In my opinion, if gender isn't a factor of if you would date somebody, you're bisexual. Please feel free to correct me, because I'm confused as to why the term "pansexual" exists.</TEXT>

Boulevard of Broken Dreams, Holiday, Wake Me Up When September Ends etc. Nickleback also weren't hated for making misogynistic lyrics back then. Arctic Monkeys just showed up with I Bet That You Look Good on the Dance Floor etc. There was rock everywhere. This faded away and R amp;B took over. Then rock came back in 2008 with bands like Kings of Leon, Kasabian, Foals etc. Songs like Use Somebody, Fire, Electric Bloom etc. They were absolutely massive. Now rock is out of the mainstream again. It won't last forever. Things come in and out of popularity all the time.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I'm an aspiring film composer and In light of the he-who-shall-not-be-named virus, I composed a piece of music called Containment. It is what I believe would be fitting of the ending to a pandemic movie where news reports broadcast the virus has been officially eradicated. There's a lot going on in the composition. The chord progression is Em | Cmaj7sus | G major | Bm/F# and then at the end it's Cmaj7 | E5 | Gsus2 | D5 Instruments used are a cello, viola, violin, double bass, piano, french horn, tubular bells and I included a kick drum mimicking a heartbeat and a closed hi-hat with a highpass filter to mimic a ticking clock. https://youtu.be/curheoXFCzA Is it well composed?

    <TEXT>Lamentoso. That means it's supposed to be played in a "mournful or grieving manner". What is that supposed to mean? You can only follow the correct notes and tempo. Other than that, all you can do is change the velocity you hit the keys and which pedals you're using. Leggiero. That means lightly or gracefully. How is that any different from pianissimo? Brilliante. Play in a showy, spirited and sparkling style. Just... What? Vivace. Translates to lively. Again... What? Words like Calando and Forte make sense. None of this makes sense to me. You can only play the notes shown on the sheet at the tempo shown on the sheet. All you can really mess around with is the velocity and pedals. If you do anything else, you're not playing the correct notes and/or the correct tempo. Can someone explain to me why these are used?</TEXT>

    <DATE>2020-03-27 19:50:42</DATE>
    <TEXT>I don't know if I worded it correctly since my music theory isn't great. What scale could I borrow from to have a harmony that's in key with this rhythm? G6 sus | A13 sus | Em/G6 (no 3) | Emadd11 | Em/G6 (no3) | A13 sus So that's one part of it. It goes 3 beats on the G6sus, 3 beats on the A13sus, 3 beats on the Em/G6 (no 3) then it hammer ons to a Emadd11 and then pulls off back to a Em/G6sus, then 1 beat on the A13 sus. To explain the hammer-on. The chord is 075000 and then that 5th fret on the D string hammer-ons to a 077000 and back to a 075000. And the A13 sus at the end is just to get back to the start of the rhythm. So what scale could be used with this?</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I have a lot of imperfections in my face. A damaged blood vessel under my eye that's left a permanent red mark, a couple of enlarged pores, dark circles etc. The majority of the make up tutorials out there aren't natural. Even the ones claiming to be natural use eyeliner and sometimes some eyeshadow. That's not what I want. I just want to conceal imperfections. Think of the kind of make up used on male models and actors? I don't want lipstick to give my lips an entirely different colour, I want them to be the same colour they already are, just fuller and more uniform. I don't want my skin to be paler or darker than it already is, I just want it to be uniform and flawless. Like I just want to use it to 1. Make my composition uniform 2. Draw attention away from what I don't like in my face 3. Enhance what I like about my face</TEXT>

Today it isn't hard to mix rap with metal or dubstep with rock. It's the norm. It isn't out of the ordinary to have glitch with beatboxing or do whatever your creativity takes you to do. You can mix classical and electronic music now, it doesn't matter. Imo the biggest artists who do this are Enter Shikari, Bring Me the Horizon, Twenty One Pilots, Yungblud and Halsey. They arent consistent, their songs are random and you never really know where it's going to go. Rather than working on a formula or the success of their old albums, they just write music **they** like. It's music for themselves rather than music for the fans. They just write music they think sounds good to them with complete disregard of how it's going to be accepted or any "fans" complaints about them changing up their sound to something they don't like etc.</TEXT>

Sometimes the watet is grey when the tide is more aggressive or during a storm. It's not just the north sea though. The Irish sea is the same. I live in Rhyl now and Rhyl, Prestatyn and Llandudno are the same. Dark blue, opaque, depressing sea. I get it has a lot to do with minerals and plankton, but why is there many places where the North Atlantic looks picturesque such as southwestern France and northwestern Spain? As well as many places on the eastern coast of the US. And then literally every bit of water surrounding the UK is grim and depressing to look at?</TEXT>

    <DATE>2020-04-03 20:29:25</DATE>
    <TEXT>I agree with the idea of feminism, but I also don't see it as an important part of my life. It was important in the 1800's and early 1900's when women didn't have a lot of power, but now imo the power struggle is more nuanced. I'll explain this in my next point. While I agree with feminism, I don't agree with a lot of feminists, because a lot of them seem to disregard all of the problems men have. For example having a bias towards women in court (custody for example) or men being seen as providers and have often times unrealistic expectations of what they should be capable of. I see men and women as being both privilaged in their own area and neither of us have equality. We're both privilaged in different areas and we're both exploited by our gender. But a lot of feminists see it as "But it was male patriarchy that caused the problems for men" which is a moot statement because I didn't ask for this society I was born into. I'm living in a bias I never made. So would you say this makes me a feminist?</TEXT>

Hair is their to protect your crotch, being hairless makes you more hygienic since there's no hair to soak up sweat and other bodily fluids. If you're a female, it makes wiping and being on the flow a lot less smelly too. So yeah, is it more beneficial to wax or leave it?

    <TEXT>You probably have tiny white dots on your balls or labia. These are fordyce spots.  gt;Fordyce spots happen when sebaceous glands, which moisturize your skin and are usually covered by your outer layer of skin, become enlarged and appear as tiny white spots. Everyone gets them, they're not an STI. It's a sebaceous gland that's become blocked, basically. Then you squeeze it and all this white stuff spirals out of it like a pimple. Satisfying.</TEXT>

Which makes no sense because energy drinks have more caffeine in them than coffee and tea has only half the amount of caffeine yet drinking twice as much tea doesn't curb the withdrawl from not having coffee.</TEXT>

    <TITLE>4 points I believe is crucial to make a good horror game</TITLE>
    <DATE>2020-04-12 14:32:09</DATE>
    <TEXT>#Tragedy in story You have to feel something for the antagonist. If there isn't some kind of human element, the antagonist becomes unrelatable and the audience detach from it. Poignancy also works. The fallen hero kind of antagonist. Marguerite Baker in Resident Evil for example.  gt;Marguerite was once a caring, loving, dutiful, kind, and traditional aged housewife who became twisted under Eveline's "gift", becoming a demented, sadistic, insane, and psychopathic shell of her former self. Being able to see her former self through the psychotic and sadistic shell she's become makes her so much more terrifying. It humanises the monster. #Setting The location should be familiar and comforting. That's what makes the demo P.T so terrifying. The corridor is unsuspecting, lived in and homely. Then it gradually becomes more and more threatening. The danger should take place in somewhere you would normally feel safe. #Playing on expectation to build tension. Here's a scenario. You hear a noise from the basement. You go into the basement, find there's a shadow looming in the depths. You turn the lights on, it's just a pile of washing. You turn around and leave the basement. You see a figure standing in the hallway. You approach the figure, it's just a mannequin. You turn around and a ghost walks right through you and disappears. Fake scare after fake scare for the audience to be on their seat not knowing when the real scare is going to happen. #Subtlety So you're playing a video game and have to enter a specific room numerous times. There's a mannequin in this room. It's cluttered and doesn't stand out much. Blends in with the scenery. This mannequin is scripted though. After looking at it, turning away and looking at it again a certain number of times, it changes to a mannequin with its head smashed off. You might notice it and think "Woah, that's fucked up. Who did that?" or it might escape your attention, but stay lingering in your mind thinking"Something about this room is off."</TEXT>

    <TITLE>Why was Manhunt and Manhunt 2 so controversial when there are games that do the same thing and received no controversy?</TITLE>
    <DATE>2020-04-15 14:04:18</DATE>
    <TEXT>You can kill whoever you want in GTA III. You can run people over and see your wheels leaving blood tracks. By the end of GTA your body count is probably 10x higher than at the end of Manhunt. However you kill someone in Manhunt and it's barbaric because "the only purpose of the game is killing people." The only thing to do in GTA is drive and kill people. You do missions involving killing people to get money to buy better weapons to be more creative in how you kill people. Yet GTA III didn't get nearly as much controversy as Manhunt. You're rewarded for being creative about how you kill people in Manhunt 2. This gets controversy. What I find funny about it though is Prototype (released only 2 years later) is ridiculously more violent and just like Manhunt you're rewarded for being creative about people. There's an achievement for running over a certain amount of bodies with a tank in 7 seconds. There's achievements for killing a certain amount of people in a single whiplash etc. However Prototype doesn't get half the amount of controversy despite being more detailed and gory. Manhunt is branded as perverted. Fallout 2 has just as much sex in it and it came out in 98. All the other examples I've given are open world games. It seems gore and violence is treated differently in open world games. Why is it barbaric to wrap a bag over a mans head in Manhunt but it's fine to decapitate someone with an axe in Skyrim?</TEXT>

None of these people even need to like The Killers, Queen, Nirvana etc or have seen 28 Days Later. They don't even need to be into rock music but still know what it is. Why?</TEXT>

    <TITLE>How do you increase drive?</TITLE>
    <DATE>2020-04-17 04:04:52</DATE>
    <TEXT>Drive is triggered by dopamine. Dopamine is what makes you want/anticpate something. It's often confused as the payoff, but that's similar to morphine. Like dopamine is feeling hungry, driving to a restaurant, smelling the food, ordering the food, waiting for the food etc. Morphine is the first bite. Dopamine is the get up and go. It's been experimented on with rats. Rats without dopamine didn't even have the drive to get food. They would eat food when handed to them, but when put in a dish, they had no effort to walk over to the food. So how can I stimulate dopamine production and make myself actually **want** to do stuff?</TEXT>

    <TITLE>Does rumination syndrome have a cure?</TITLE>
    <DATE>2020-04-17 14:29:15</DATE>
    <TEXT>I'm not asking for medical advice or how to get better. I'm just asking if it can be cured. It's a motility disorder characterised by effortless regurgitation of food. I think it's the diaphragm that it effects because of the way I regurgitate. I push my diaprham down and tense my abs and then heave. It's like I'm making my diaphragm push the food out of my stomach and then heaving it up my oesophagus. Obviously this isn't a problem because I'm in control of this. I can just make the decision to not do it. The problem is when I have hiccups (which is why I believe it's my diaphragm) or when I've overeaten, it becomes out of my control. My body will just do it whether I like it or not. It's like involuntary bulimia. Like your body is bulimic and you can't do anything about it. Can it be cured? Are there exercises or surgery or anything that can make the diaphragm behave normally?</TEXT>

    <DATE>2020-04-18 17:37:06</DATE>
    <TEXT>This is just a rant. If you don't want to read it go to below the heading for the actual post. Getting kinda tired of people saying Ezio's trilogy is the best game in the franchise. It's the most popular, yeah. You're basically saying "Ezio trilogy is my *favourite* game in the series." There is no best Assassin's Creed game. Everyone's favourite AC game varies from person to person. A lot of people's favourite is Black Flag. Some people prefer Origins to everything else. My personal favourite is the first game and I'll stand by that no matter how many people tell me I'm wrong. I prefer the stoic, silent, not so flashy, gets the job done and gets out kind of assassin. Basically Alta #239;r. It was also AC2 that introduced all the pointless fluff like buying weapons (I'd rather be automatically rewarded for playing the game like in AC1 since I didn't buy the game to buy Rome), health bars (we're in a simulation. There's no health. We desynchronize, not die) monopoly, beating husbands etc. Point being. Don't tell people their opinion is wrong. Your opinion isn't right either, everyone's opinion is valid providing it's harmless. #Back to the original point... What's your favourite Assassin's Creed game so far? What is it about the game that makes it your favourite and what are you hoping for in the next installment? I miss the liberation/tower missions from the older games. Love it when the map is hostile until you free it up e.g Far Cry, Brotherhood etc.</TEXT>

There was an experiment similat to Milgram's back in the 80's. I can't remember the name of it, but college students were asked to shock an unknown person in the next room. Students who were not wearing a nametag and had a hoodie on were more likely to shock the person than students who were wearing a nametag and no hoodie. So the feeling of anonymity played a role in it. Then there's also Darren Brown's The Experiments. In the remote control gameshow episode, due to everyone wearing a mask and getting into the mob mentality they made the guys night absolutely hell. Even having no problems with choosing for him to be abducted and arressted. There's no way you can say every person in that crowd was evil. It was the anonymity.

I'd be in assembly hall and everyone would recite the pater noster then sing a hymn. I grew up in an atheist family and felt a bit baffled by the fact that most of the kids there (most not even old enough to have a developed opinion on religion) are idly singing hymns not even realising what any of it means or that they're worshipping a god they may or may not believe in. The icing on the cake is there were 2 Sikh kids in my assembly hall wearing a Rum #227;l and reciting the Lord's prayer. How inappropriate is that? In a lot of circumstances, you send your kid to a Catholic school because it's all that's available, not because you yourself are Catholic.

    <TEXT>Like I get it, they suck when youre a low level. I first ran into them when looking for caravans with Cass at like level 9 or something and died in seconds. But when you have a sniper rifle and high sneak level, they go down like flies. One shot them from around 30m away. So yeah... High level energy, guns or explosive + sneak + VATS and you're winning. They're not even that scary. I have a crippling phobia of wasps and Cazadors don't have that distressed buzzing sound to make them scary. Sound design could have been way better. Also Entomologist. There's no reason to not get Entomologist. It's too helpful.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Sexuality isn't something significant. Do straight people ever make their heterosexuality a big deal? Do they join a community for straight people? They don't, because sexuality isn't something that's important. It plays a role in who you're attracted to, that's it. Like I'm bisexual and I don't give it a second thought. Nobody would know I'm bisexual unless they asked me because I don't see it something that needs to be addressed it's kind of nobodies business what my sexuality is. It's like me joining a community of atheists. Completely unnecessary.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I keep hearing about how it isn't safe to be gay in the US and that there's a lot of homophobia still present. I'm bisexual and have live in an impoverished conurbation in England. I used to see homophobia all the time (mainly by kids because I was a kid at the time) but since around 2008 I haven't seen nearly enough homophobia to call it "a problem that needs addressing." People here generally don't see anyone else's sexuality as any of their business.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>When I was in primary (elementary) school the was this kid who's entire body and face looked like he had keratosis pilaris. His skin also felt rough and bumpy. It appeared to be genetic because his mum and older brother were the same. Definitely wasn't keratosis pilaris because it normally occurs after 10 years old and it only affects small patches. This was literally all over his skin everywhere. They were also albino so I don't know if that has anything to do with it.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>The number of humans killed per year by Mosquito's is up to 1,000,000. The number of humans killed per year by humans (murder) is 475,000. Snakes is 50,000 and then dogs is 25,000. Those are the 4th top causes of animal related deaths worldwide. Yet there are more people scared of harmless animals such as spiders, wasps, sharks and rodents than there are people scared of dogs. I'm not saying people should be scared of dogs. What I'm saying is if you're so comfortable around dogs, why are you so afraid of a rat or a spider? I have 3 teeth marks in my arm from a Japanese Akita and that wasn't even a bite, I was nipped. She was playing. I've never once been bit by a spider. You're 28 times more likely to be killed by a dog than a spider and at only 25,000 dog related deaths per year, spiders are harmless. 25,000 divided by 28. You do the math.</TEXT>

    <TITLE>Games should be more like Mirror's Edge</TITLE>
    <DATE>2020-05-07 02:32:41</DATE>
    <TEXT>I mean the first Mirror's Edge, not Catalyst. What the first game does is it focuses on one area (parkour) and tailors the game to that. Linear story, level based progression, set pieces are varied and colour coded to enhance ease of access, gameplay and progression. It picks something and then sticks with that one thing as the driving force of the game. Too many games are trying to please everyone and consequently please nobody. If you mix too much into the pot, each individual area becomes watered down. For example the original Assassin's Creed purely focused on being an assassin following the creed and nothing more. Then AC2 introduced beating up husbands, races, monopoly etc. Things nobody bought the game for. I.e straying away from the core gameplay. We bought the game for blades to go into throats and running on top of rooftops. If I'm playing a stealth game, I'd rather play a game that does stealth perfectly (Metal Gear Solid 3: Snake Eater) than a game that has a watered down stealth (Far Cry 3) with a "Play as you want" kind of approach. Games developers should have the balls to make a game that's like "This is the genre of the game. You're going to play the game this way and if you don't, you're gonna have a bad time." What do you think made Thief: The Dark Project so much more beloved than Thief? That exact mindset. It was a stealth game and nothing more. It wasn't a "Play as you want" kind of game.</TEXT>

Whereas countries like Hondorus, Samoa, Cameroon, Sri Lanka, Laos, Lithuania etc aren't very well known. It's not due to size either. Estonia is a small country, but many people have heard of it. Cote d'lvoire is a large country and most people haven't heard of it. So why are there a lot of countries where when you mention them people are like "What's/where's that?"</TEXT>

    <TITLE>How can I build muscle and stay lithe at the same time?</TITLE>
    <DATE>2020-05-11 14:51:31</DATE>
    <TEXT>I used to be muscular when I was 15. Then a year later I developed bulimia and I'm still recovering from it. Currently managed to work up to eating 2 meals a day. Back when I was 15 I was eating between 4-6 meals every day and training in the gym every single day for 20-30 minutes. I used to weigh 69.8kg at 5'5. Now I'm 5'7 and 57kg. Currently (slowly) gaining weight, I was 52kg a year ago. So what I mean by "lithe" is I used to have what you could call a [swimmers body](https://cdn.swimswam.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/Swimmers-Shoulder.jpg) there was muscle there, but I was in no way stacked. How can I get like this again with my current condition of struggling to eat 2 meals a day?</TEXT>

    <TITLE>I've never played Tomb Raider before, where should I start?</TITLE>
    <DATE>2020-05-17 15:37:57</DATE>
    <TEXT>So I believe there's 3 timelines. The Survivor Trilogy (newer games) are the origins of Lara Croft. Then there's the Legend Trilogy (Legend, Anniversary and Underworld) and there's the Original Series which is Tomb Raider to Angel of Darkness. I could be wrong so if I am, correct me. What makes no sense to me is all of these different timelines share one game in common with each other. Tomb Raider is an adaptation of the Tomb Raider Film which is based on Tomb Raider Anniversary which is a reboot of Tomb Raider. Which means all of these seperate timelines/universes aren't separate at the same time? It confuses me. Anyway, where should I start? Note: I still enjoy PS1 games so how dated something is doesn't make it less appealing to me. I'd only avoid the PS1 games if the story is generally just awful.</TEXT>

    <TITLE>Why do people go to self defence courses?</TITLE>
    <DATE>2020-05-31 08:01:13</DATE>
    <TEXT>The majority of self defence courses show you how to defend from an attacker based on a fabricated idea of what the attacker is going to do or how he's going to react. It's impossible to know. All you can do is have enough wit to be able to react quickly to whatever he throws at you which is something that comes from experience rather than something that can be taught. It's pointless saying "you do this, then this, then he'll move his arm here, then you do this" because there is no guarantee at all that it's going to turn out that way. He might just duck under you and deliver 5 quick jabs to your ribs and you're on your knees unable to breathe. Knife defense is a joke as well. Most cases of knife related violence involve the attacker concealing the weapon and striking when he's already close to the target. You cannot defend yourself from that. You're literally fucked. Making money from false hope. Why do people go to the courses, take it seriously and actually buy into it?</TEXT>

    <DATE>2020-06-04 19:44:50</DATE>
    <TEXT>I live in the UK so this came as a shock to me. The term jaywalking doesn't even exist here, most people in the UK probably won't know what "jaywalking" is since we simply call it "crossing the road." It's a normal thing everyone does. Anyway, shouldn't it be down to the individual to look after their own safety and make a calculated decision on if crossing the road is safe or not? I think it's a bit ridiculous to be fined for crossing the road when a car is a good 50m away and it's obviously safe to do so.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I've been duct taped to a chair and had duct tape over my mouth as a joke when I was 9. 20 minutes later I was free. Kept moving my mouth, eventually enough of the duct tape become unstuck that I could open my mouth. Bit down on the duct tape and literally chewed it to pull it away from my mouth. Wriggled my wrists until the duct tape was loose enough to manually peel it off. Then hopped the chair over to where the scissors are to cut the rest. Duct tape isn't that strong.

    <TEXT>Like if someone is speaking to a Japanese person, they'll often jump to Japan as a topic to talk about and talk about events that are happening in Japan (e.g the Olympics) or politics/news surrounding Japan. Why? It's like stating "You're different. Lets talk about that." If I moved to America and everyone started talking about the Queen or tea and crumpets or whatever I'd get sick of it fast. Like if that was people's way of "breaking the ice." Your country shouldn't be important. Not taking note of someone's ethnicity shows "You're one of us. We're on the same level. We're equal." Like if I was talking to a Chinese person for the first time, I'd just talk about the same stuff I talk about everyone else with and not focus on the fact they're Chinese.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Is it mental or physical? Do people really have different pain tolerance to each other or are the people with a" high pain tolerance" just able to take their mind of it more easily than others i.e mental strength? Like I've had exposed bone in my shin from a nasty dent and it just felt like a bruise but I get a minor burn and I won't shut up about how much it hurts. I've fell in a bush of nettles and didn't complain about it, but I hit the back of my head of a wall and I'm in tears. What I'm saying is when it comes to some types of pain, I'm great with it. Other types, I cry like a little bitch. So is it really pain tolerance or is it just being used to one pain over the other so you're already mentally prepared for it before it happens? Like boxers can be punched in the nose and shrug it off because they're used to it. Someone who has never been in a fight though will probably be scared of anything hitting them in the nose.</TEXT>

    <DATE>2020-06-16 15:43:17</DATE>
    <TEXT>I'm talking about injuries in cutscenes that are canon to the story. In the reboot, Lara would have been dead 5 minutes in when she falls on a spike. Even if it narrowly missed her organs, the dirty water would have eventually got to her. Not to mention she pulled the spike out, so blood loss is a factor to consider as well. She'd probably die of blood loss within an hour of the injury. Probably sooner because she's in wet clothing in freezing rain and would get hypothermia. Shit like this goes on throughout the whole trilogy. How can you claim a game is trying to be realistic when she's back on her feet moments after getting out of a bear trap?</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I love the amount of damage A Light in Shining Darkness delivers but the fact it can only shoot 6 times before reloading puts me off a bit as that means one VATS sequence is dedicated to reloading more often than say if I was using a weathered 10mm pistol. A weathered 10mm pistol doesn't give out as much damage though. What would you say is a good middle ground between damage and magazine capacity? I was also considering Sleepytyme but it has roughly the same damage as the Weathered 10mm. I need something with enough DPS and damage to be effective against mobs like Tunnlers and giant radscorpions.</TEXT>

    <TITLE>Were games really better in the PS1/PS2 era?</TITLE>
    <DATE>2020-06-20 23:51:47</DATE>
    <TEXT>I've come to prefer PS1/PS2 games over newer games. I find that games as of now have a fixed formula and very rarely stray far from that formula. LT to aim RT to shoot for example or A or Y always being to jump and A or X being to interact. B or L3 is almost always to crouch. Not just controls, gameplay too. If you see chest high walls, you know there's gonna be a shoot out. Quests are usually either fetch quest or go kill somebody. Puzzles are becoming easier. Especially with things like glimmering objects saying "This can be interacted with." Kills the exploration. It's like games have ADHD now. You're not allowed to be stuck for a couple of minutes and spend time scratching your head. The game wants you to be constantly in this repetitive gameplay loop that's used in almost every other game. Compare the classic Tomb Raider to the LAU reboot and then to the survivor reboot? It gets easier and easier with each reboot. Games were just more experimental and less predictable back in the day imo. Newer games don't feel fun. They rely so much on this "perfected" formula that almost every game I play feels like "This feels like I've already played this game before, just it's reskinned." They felt more like games rather than a brand or a product.</TEXT>

    <DATE>2020-06-21 12:18:03</DATE>
    <TEXT>I was recently called a luddite and went away and looked at what one is. Basically people who prefer to read books than browse social media. Prefer to visit a theatre than a cinema etc. The reason I was called a luddite is because I don't buy the newest technology. If a new phone comes out that I want or a new game console or TV, I wait 3-5 years until it's significantly dropped in price and then buy it. I'm still using an XBox 360 and probably won't get a PS4 until the PS5 comes out. My phone is a low tier Samsung that came out 3 years ago etc. Does this make me a luddite because from my perspective it's just "I like having money and if I wait to buy things, I can keep more money." Like games cost  #163;50 on release date and drop to  #163;4 a couple of years later.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>It's an environmental issue that could be stopped by just not buying caged eggs. If nobody bought them, they'd go out of business. All the chickens would be killed off, but none of them would be suffering. Besides, the eggs are tiny, covered in blood, feathers and shit and are prone to having blood spots in the eggs anyway. It's literal pennies more to get free range and only a few pennies more than that to get organic eggs. I don't see the benefit other than being literally less than  #163;1 cheaper than they are. They're tiny, covered in filth, supporting malpractice. Whereas you could pay like an extra 57p to get large, clean and eco friendly eggs. Free range hens aren't treated great, but still better than caged hens.</TEXT>

If the UK were a state in the US it would be the 12 largest state since it's literally the size of Idaho. It's tiny.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>What gives a human sentience is they're able to think rather than just do what their commands tell them to do. We were all single-celled organisms at one point without any sentience. We evolved through mutation and it was mutation that gave us sentience. There must have been one organism that had sentience before everything else? So if you programmed a lot of loops into AI (I'm talking petabytes of coding here) so that every situation had thousands of possibilities, but somehow placed mutations (or imperfections) in these loops to prevent the AI choosing the best possible outcome or just one at random and instead choose based on experience, goals and needs (I.e the AI is able to make mistakes but also learn from experience) Would it be possible to create sentience?</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I can only stop myself after I've realised I've done it. It's automatic. I've tried bitter nail polish but it's not bitter enough to bother me. It's got to the point where my fingers smell septic from the amount of skin I've bitten off. I've done this since I was a kid. It started with nail biting, then I moved onto the skin around my nails and now I bite close to the nail bed.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>The XBox 360 E. It's a smaller, untested, less stable version of the 360 slim with no VGA support and costs literally the same price as the slim. Why would you want to downgrade whilst spending the same amount of money? The 360 slim is flawless. I've had one since 2011 and it's yet to fail me. Actually, while on the subject... Nintendo did the same with the Wii V2. The V2 is a shitter and more expensive version of the Wii. Why change something that isn't broke, make it worse and them raise the price? Sony did it too. PS3 super slim is less stable than the PS3 and PS3 slim. The differences between the XBox One, XBox One S and XBox One X are noticeable and get better with each version. The difference between the PS4 and PS4 Pro are worthwhile. The PS2 slim works better than the original PS2. The PS3 slim works better than the PS3 original. But the PS3 super slim, Wii V2 and XBox 360 E aren't tested, unstable and generally fail within a couple of months. Why make them?</TEXT>

    <TITLE>Religious indoctrination should be kept away from schools</TITLE>
    <DATE>2020-07-09 22:08:20</DATE>
    <TEXT>I went to catholic school. I didn't really have a choice as every school in my town is a catholic school. Thankfully the religious shit ended when I went to secondary school. It's generally accepted that children cannot consent, so why does everyone turn a blind eye to religious indoctrination in schools? They're children who cannot consent, who don't understand that they're being indoctrinated and aren't mature enough to make an informed decision of what they believe in. I used to have to sit in the assembly hall every morning and recite the lords prayer and sing hymns. We all had to and that's the problem. Some of us were already born into a religion that's not Catholicism. There were 2 sikhs in my assembly hall. One wearing a rum #225;l and the other wearing a patka so their religion was blatant. It's insensitive, arrogant and downright abhorrent that the head teacher conducting the assembly just let them recite the lords prayer ignorant to the fact they're going against their own religion. I'm not against religion, I'm against forced religion. Praying in assembly halls, having priests come into your classrooms like "Y'all heard about Jesus?", visiting churches etc. Religious education should be replaced with equality and diversity. Religious education (from my experience) is centred around Catholicism and occasionally touches on other religions though it's a very minor part of the curriculum (the only other religion I learned about in school was Sikhism and visited a mosque once). Unless you what to study theology which it won't be helpful anyway due to it being centered around one religion, it's not a very helpful subject. Equality and diversity focuses on identity. Gender, religion, cultural background, class backgroud etc. It can tie in nicely with any social science or public service you may wish to specialise in. It also helps with understanding the way society shapes us, how people work and why we are the way we are. Luckily for me, R.E was no longer mandatory after I was in 9th grade (13-14 years old) and **was** replaced with E amp;D. However, I'd have benefited more from those 8 years of R.E being replaced with E.D since it's a more versatile subject.</TEXT>

    <TITLE>How come some people have a really low tolerance to sour things and others (like myself) absolutely love anything that's sour?</TITLE>
    <DATE>2020-07-12 23:57:01</DATE>
    <TEXT>The only argument I've seen to this is 1. We have a natural aversion to anything sour due to survival instincts and the idea that spoiled food is sour. This seems like bs to me though because literally every citrus fruit is sour. 2. Super tasters and non tasters. I'm not a non taster and I absolutely love sour stuff. I wouldn't put it past me that there's supertasters who don't mind sour stuff and non tasters who hate sour stuff. Like it's not simply just not liking it. People who "don't like it" also have an intense physical response to sour things. Why do some people do and some don't?</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I grew up with a SEGA Genesis instead so I haven't played a lot of Nintendo games that aren't on handheld. Going back to the SEGA genesis games with the mega drive collection for the PSP I found it was kinda meh. Echo the Dolphin, Sonic, Comix Zone and Phantasy Star were good but they're were all easily outshined by the PS1 and Dreamcast imo. Is it just nostalgia? I have a feeling if I got a SNES I'd get bored once the novelty wears off.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>My dad used to play Smackdown! 2 almost every day back in the late 90's. He hasn't played it for years and then I brought my 360 to his house a couple of years ago (he hadn't played it in around 9 years) and challenged him to a game of Smackdown Vs. Raw 2008. He kicked my ass on it despite me having more experience with it. Then I challenged him to a game of Tony Hawk's American Wasteland. I beat him by several hundred of thousand points. I'd only played the game for 4 days. What I'm asking is how come some people can pick up a new game and be either terrible or great at it depending on the type of game? I almost always play either FPS or AARPG games but I can pick up 2D fighting games like Tekken and Mortal Combat or skateboarding games and be reasonably good at them enough to understand most of the combinations. The only platformers I've played in my childhood were Crash Tag Team Racing, Spyro and Rayman 3. Never touched a platformer since I was a kid until I picked up Mirror's Edge and Assassin's Creed and breezed through them. Then if I pick up a game like FIFA or GTA or Hitman I'm shit at them and don't know what I'm doing. Tl;dr there's games I've played that I have some experience with that I'm terrible at and there's games I've had no experience with that I'm decent at. Why are people better at some types of games than others even when playing for the first time?</TEXT>

When I played Tekken 3 for the first time, I had absolutely no experience with memorizing combos or quickly inputting them but I'm pretty good at it from the first time playing it. Learned all of Kings moves in around 2 days. Then there's games I've had a lot of experience with but are still terrible at, for example bullet hell games where you have to dodge dozens of objects to stay alive.</TEXT>

Boss's aren't random and they'll do each move in a specific pattern and you have to learn the pattern to counter effectively. 2. Minions. I love when there's like 20 weaker enemies around the boss to keep things from being too easy. 3. A second maybe even third form.</TEXT>

    <DATE>2020-07-16 12:05:56</DATE>
    <TEXT>I had this idea of guns blowing up on you. Weapon deterioration is already a thing, but it's kind of basic. Just another stat bar that gradually goes down. Guns go boom on you if the bullet gets stuck in the chamber or if the chamber is damaged. This basically destroys the gun and makes it useless and also potentially maims you. So it would be great to see that in games. Like when a weapon is under 40% condition it has a chance of blowing up on you and the probability increases the lower the condition. If it blows up on you, it takes a portion of your health away depending on the ammunition and makes your gun unusable. It would be an incentive to keep your weapons in good condition. What are some of your ideas that have never been used?</TEXT>

    <DATE>2020-07-17 02:40:56</DATE>
    <TEXT>I don't know anyone and have a difficult time finding people on the internet who are unaware of the damage mental illness has. A cretin could understand depression can be crippling at the worst of times. I don't mean this in an insensitive way. I have my own mental illnesses and know what it's like. I'm just saying everyone is pretty well informed these days. The topic doesn't need to be popularised or made the forefront of anything. It seems like a fad now for plots in movies or newspaper headlines to have something to do with mental health. We don't do this with physical illnesses. Like you don't see a guy in a wheelchair on TV and that's his character, he's a cripple. You see that a lot with mental health though. "One of our characters has schizophrenia, look how trendy we are!" Just feels like being "woke" about the seriousness and how common mental health is is being shoved down our throats. 20% of US citizens either have, have had or will have PTSD at some point in their life. 10% of the world are sociopaths. 25% of the UK has, will have or have had depression. It's so common that we're all aware, we don't need awareness spoonfed to us. Tl;dr we're being made aware of something most people are already aware of.</TEXT>

She also had kids. Warning signs are subjective to the individual. Some people give nothing to go on. A school should cope with the loss of a student the way the already do. Conduct a memorial assembly and hold a charitable event. Basically, all of your points have answers.</TEXT>

    <TITLE>Why is it commonly believed by non-smokers that smokers don't like smoking and only smoke because they're addicted?</TITLE>
    <DATE>2020-07-17 04:32:12</DATE>
    <TEXT>I'm asking because it's really not that difficult to wrap you head around why a stimulant would feel good. A lot of us don't quit simply because we literally have no desire to. Absolutely no interest in quitting. It's highly addictive, but it doesn't mean it isn't pleasurable. Why would we continue after our first ever cigarette if it didn't give us a rush of euphoria? The American Cancer society freely admitted that close to 90% of smokers got pleasure out of smoking and that's why it was difficult for them to quit. Think about it, it normally takes a week for addiction to set in. You don't have just one drag of a cigarette and become addicted. It takes a lot of nicotine to create the chemical imbalance. So if it requires continued use, why would we continue using it unless it was enjoyable? I'm addicted to coffee but I still get a rush of euphoria if I drink a cup of coffee after going a little too long without one. Coffee and cigarettes are stimulants and stimulants make the user feel good.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>There's coffee addicts who have this mindset about smoking though. Like they don't stop drinking coffee because they enjoy the taste of coffee and the hit of euphoria and comfort it brings, but then they can't apply that same logic to why addicts don't want to quit smoking and assume they simply can't because they're too addicted.</TEXT>

Yard Foot and Inch when it's Height, Football, Snooker Cues, Carpets and pretty much anything else. Weight is Metric when it's food, unless it's a steak or a burger. Imperial when it's a persons weight. Car efficiency is measured in Miles Per Gallon, but the Fuel is sold in Litres. Recipes for cooking food can and will contain both measurements (I feel this is just to fuck with us)</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I absolutely hate the idea of rope arrows. There is no way an arrow could support your body weight. It would snap immediately. I get its a video game and not everything is supposed to be realistic, but I just can't suspend my disbelief that much for it to be logically sound. If rope arrows were used in a fictional game like Kingdom Hearts, I could completely get behind that. In games like Thief and Tomb Raider though, it's a dumb concept. A grappling hook would have been better and more believable than a rope arrow. The fascination with the feats in games like Tomb Raider and Thief is their actions are supposed to appear conceivable, not do things where you're like "Yeah, no."</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I was in a relationship for 4 years and it kind of just stagnated. We eventually got to the point where we never had anything new or interesting to talk about because we pretty much knew everything about each other. Conversations started becoming scripted and repetitive. My ex wasn't happy for at least the last year of our relationship, maybe more. It started to feel like a loveless relationship. I severed the relationship so she could have a chance at being happy with someone else. It's been around 3 weeks and I think she's starting to feel happy now, at least she told me she's happy. I frequently keep finding I miss her though and I don't know what to do with myself. I just keep telling myself that it's for the best, we weren't compatible, she's happier now etc. Since I was in a relationship for so long and also moved location, all of my friends are gone. I tried getting in contact with them, but I'm just a relic of their life. They've moved on, got a job, have kids, go to uni etc. I just don't belong in their life anymore. So I'm alone now. So I don't really have any distractions from missing her.</TEXT>

    <TITLE>Why do people often confuse being well spoken for being intelligent?</TITLE>
    <DATE>2020-07-21 16:54:40</DATE>
    <TEXT>I'm by no means dumb, but I'm not intelligent either. I'm as average as you can get. But because I can read, write, spell and have a large vocabulary and put words together "eloquently" I'm viewed as intelligent by most people which sets unfair expectations of me that I'm tired of correcting. This was apparent when studying painting and decorating in college. The majority of the people in my course where below average, likely failed school. I was viewed as a genius when in reality I was average and everyone else was way below average, but because I was smarter than them and they mistakenly viewed themselves as average... I've been around enough people who are top of their game to know I'm far from being intelligent and have a lot to learn.</TEXT>

    <TITLE>People hate Apple now because Steve Jobs basically WAS Apple</TITLE>
    <DATE>2020-07-26 23:43:20</DATE>
    <TEXT>Looking at all of the iPhones back to back, the performance gets better with each installment. Even between the 6 and the 7, the change isn't massive but still significant. The problem is the marketing. Since Steve Jobs passed, the marketing has just tanked and as a result Apple has been overshadowed by brands like Huawei and Samsung. The same thing happened to Samsung. Look at the recent Samsung advertising, it's basically "Here's our new phone. This is what the camera can do. Buy it." Just talking about the camera and nothing more. Which is probably why Samsung is being overshadowed by Google Pixel and OnePlus now. The phones have always been good and have never reachef a plateau. It's all just advertising. The advertising is half assed now. Also without having Steve Jobs (a remarkably charismatic man) as the face of Apple anymore.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Since around 2016 it seems all the latest flagship phones focus primarily on the camera. Especially with Samsung, 80% of their ads is talking about only the camera and the other 20% is usually about streaming or battery life. Being someone who rarely uses the camera on my phone, I just don't understand it. If you wanted a really good camera, wouldn't you just buy a camera?

    <TEXT>In Fallout and TES games. The principle is basically "Marvel at me taking control away from you while I leave you completely defenceless for 5 seconds." It's at it's most infuriating when you're trying to stealth and can get away with taking 2 enemies out if you do it in quick succession, but you can't because you got a crit which causes the killcam to give the other enemy enough time to be alerted. You could argue "Yeah, but you can turn it off in Fallout." It doesnt turn it completely off, it just makes it less cinematic and changes the view to 1st person. You still get killcams with cinematic kills turned off.</TEXT>

    <TITLE>Why do some subs require a text body even when the title is self explanatory and requires no further elaboration?</TITLE>
    <DATE>2020-07-28 14:35:37</DATE>
    <TEXT>I'll use r/unpopularopinions as an example. I could make the statement Will.I.am is a terrible singer. Not unpopular, I know. I just couldn't think of one for this post. Anyway, the title is self explanatory. I think Will.I.am can't sing. Why would I need to elaborate on that? The whole point of the sub is to give an unpopular opinion, that's my ~~popular~~ unpopular opinion so that should meet the criteria for it to be posted, right? It isn't r/changemyview where I have to form an argument for people to counter. It's just a sub where you give an unpopular opinion and people upvote it if it's unpopular and downvote it if it's unpopular. So why do a lot of subreddits require a text body even when there's nothing more to be said without simply repeating yourself? What more can you say other than "If you listen to him sing, it sounds bad. So he is bad at singing."? That wouldn't even meet the word count.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Sex dolls are one of the few things moving the advancement of AI forward. The silicone design for sex dolls is basically the basis of what the CPU will be housed in. The AI Sophia has been granted citizenship in Saudi Arabia. So she has the rights a normal person would have. Given that AI cannot act on free will and simply follows commands set by the admin, would owning an advance sex doll (a possibility in the future) be on the same lines as rape/sexual slavery?

    <TEXT>I have no formal diagnosis, but I do completely lack emotional empathy. I can understand what a person is feeling and what their thought process may be, but I have no idea how to share their emotion or how to react to it. Basically I can't feel what another person is feeling. I've been outcasted a lot of times because of my lack of empathy. I feel alienated most of the time and there's such a taboo on anything resembling sociopathic tendancies that it's difficult to talk to people about it without getting disgust in return. I am also not a sentimental person. I have no sentiment in anything. Christmas is meaningless, birthdays are meaningless, every day is just another day. This is an issue with most sociopaths, they're bored by everything. Boredom can eventually lead to suicidal behaviour, drug abuse and other reckless behaviour which is another issue with ASPD since sociopaths are more prone to risk taking and abusing substances/sex/gambling. Therapy cannot cure that. You don't learn empathy, you develop it and if you don't develop it during those critical stages of development, it's gone.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Suicide can be both rational and unhuried. I've wanted to kill myself for literally half of my life. The only reason I haven't is I have no means of doing so painlessly, like a gun. I could use peroxide, but injecting that into your veins takes 15 seconds to kill you and is very painful, pain I'd rather go without. Considering how long I've wanted to and how much I've thought about, contemplated and reasoned with the idea, I would say it's rational. The idea that all mental health conditions can be cured is fallacy. NPD can't be cured and doesn't go away, ASPD is the same. So for people like those, it is just the same situation as a physically disabled person wanting euthanasia.</TEXT>

    <TITLE>Why do a lot of people consider werewolfs to be better over vampire lords?</TITLE>
    <DATE>2020-07-29 22:09:32</DATE>
    <TEXT>This has been a thing ever since the Dawnguard DLC released, but why? - Werewolves cannot walk on water, Vampire Lords can. - You can join the Dawnguard and be a Vampire Lord at the same time so you also don't exactly miss anything. - It's easier to level as a Vampire Lord since you just kill enemies (with ranged magic) and get EXP. Whereas for werewolfs, you have to eat their heart which is time consuming and breaks the flow of battle. - Vampire Lord has more abilities - Vampire Lord has boosts even when in human form and debuffs can be countered with enchantments and leveling. -50 to health magic and stamina? Legendary skills and no level cap makes that issue non-existent. No regen? Enchanting. Weakness to fire? Go with Dunmer or... Enchanting. Don't have any perks in Enchanting? Legendary skills... - Vampire Lord allows you to summon undead and gargoyles. Way better than Ice Wolves and Werewolves. Don't want to miss out on summoning werewolves? Get the Beast Stone and summon a werebear, even better. - Can revert form at will **and** not have to re-equip all your items. - At level 252 and a half I played a fully leveled Werewolf and at the same level switched to Vampire Lord. Vampire Lord was stronger. Both one shot most enemies, but Vampire Lord has range. If you just like the aesthetics of being a werewolf or it fits into your roleplaying, that's fine. But other than being able to sprint faster than a horse, what does a Werewolf have over a Vampiee Lord? Edit: Also forgot to mention Vampire Lords are undead and gain better spell effects from Necromage. With 940 health I can replenish over 2/3 of it with one dual cast grand healing spell.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>My gear is pretty good. I used Ahzidal's gear to give me an extra 10% enchanting bonus. Made fortify smithing gear which has a total of something like 112% fortify smithing to increase my weapons and armour. Armour rating with shield is something like 1200-1300. Hemelt has fortify archery and 70% magic regen. Chest has health regen and fortify heavy armour. Boots have fortify stamina and two handed. Gauntlets have fortify one handed and archery. Shield has fortify block and magic residence. Ring has magic resistance and fortify archery and necklace has magic resistance and fortify heavy armour. Needless to say, I can stand in front of a legendary dragon on legendary difficulty, make a cup of coffee, come back and I've lost 5% of my health which is regenerating. Then kill it in 3 duel flurries with dagger and mace. All without exploiting the game. Just using 100 enchanting and Ahzidals armour.</TEXT>

Its also a novice Conjuration spell that costs like 84 magicka or something. You get him in the Soul Cairn. Look for his skull (should be on a pedestal) and return his skull to his owner.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>You can be a Vampire during the day. All you get is - -50 to health, magicka and stamina - no HMS regen - as well as a constant 50% weakness to fire day or night Every single one of those can be countered with enchantments, perks, racial bonuses and standing stones. My armour alone counters all of those issues and the -50 to HMS is negligible since I have 940 HMS anyway.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>When was magic ever weak? I can take out a snow sabre cat with one icy spear, a snow bear in two icy spears. Frenzy is overpowered and works on literally every enemy when dual casted. Just cast frenzy and let everyone duel it out. Backstab the victor. Paralyse is also overpowered with mass paralysis being a joke. Grand healing is basically playing on god mode. Being a vampire doesn't mean you have to play at night. Even at the start of the game you can find items with regen. Mid game just enchant your own. Being a Vampire Lord, you get a much more powerful character just with some debuffs you have t control, but they are easy enough to control through leveling and enchanting. You also don't even have to have any perks in enchanting. Do The Book of Love quest to get 15% magic resistance and choose The Lord Stone to get another 25%. That 50% weakness to fire becomes a 5% weakness to fire.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>"Examples of 6G performance requirements are a peak data rate of 1,000 Gbps (gigabits per second) and air latency less than 100 microseconds ( #956;s), 50 times the peak data rate and one-tenth the latency of 5G." If that became a thing worldwide, any further improvements would be unnoticeable. A data rate of 1,000 Gbps would be insane. 5G is only 500 Mbps. Latency of 100 microseconds would be so fast that it would be probably impossible for us to notice any difference if it got any fasrer than that. Would 6G be a plateau?</TEXT>

Maybe play candycrush or a similar game. You can do all of that and more on a  #163;120 phone. Then I show them what their phone can do and either they never do it or explicitly tell me "Nah, that's too complicated for me." Then why buy it if you're going to treat it like a low tier phone? Why not just buy a phone for your needs, which in this case is a low tier phone? Why waste money?</TEXT>

Coupled with the Alterteration perks, that's 70% resistance to magic as well as my natural 50% fire resistance to fire counteracting the 50% weakness to fire. Then the additional 30% resistance to magic from my armour. 100% resistance to magic whenever I have my shield. Armour rating with 940 health too and fortify heavy armour enchantments. I'd 100% recommend using fortify one handed/two handed/unarmed. When your skill is over 100 almost every attack gets you a cinematic kill.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>You could argue "It shows you thought about them." "Happy Birthday/Mother's Day/Valentine's Day etc" also shows you thought about them. How does a  #163;3 piece of cardboard that's gonna end up in the bin in a week showing you care? We get people cards for no other reason than it's simplistic ritual we've seen and been told to do since birth. We do it for no other reason than it's expected of us and feel some kind of guilt if we don't because of how culturally ingrained it is. Imo going out of your way for someone is showing you care. Aiding someone in financial need, taking one of your days off work to spend time with someone, giving emotional support to someone whether it's cheering someone up or cheering somebody on. Taking 5 seconds to stop by the card section when you're picking up your groceries... that is not going out of your way for someone. Cards are meaningless. "Hey I got you a card" "Heh, you haven't contacted me in 6 months and suddenly care because its my birthday" Sound familiar? It's a shallow gesture.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Honestly, I'd be content with a simple "Happy birthday." Maybe a gesture like someone getting me a coffee or something, a gesture that involves somebody actually take time out of their day to spend time with you. Card to me just seem a bit standard. Like someone got me a card simply because that's the norm. So it makes me question "I wonder if any thought at all actually went into that." Gifts are a bit eh. If someone really takes their time to consider who I am and what I like and what would be a good gift for me, I'm happy. If someone gets me something random just for the sake of getting me something e.g a shirt with a tacky design on it that's not even in my size, I feel offended and would have felt less offended if they didn't get me anything at all because it shows they don't even know me.</TEXT>

For example when sharks "sleep" they're still alert of everything since they're not actually asleep, they're just in a low energy state. Wasps are the same. They go back to their nest and tend to their young through the night. Basically never sleeping, just resting.</TEXT>

    <DATE>2020-08-01 10:44:31</DATE>
    <TEXT>For example Silent Alarm by Bloc Party is described as being social commentary  gt;"Silent Alarm does not contain a solitary lyrical centre and simply observes people's lives.[10] Okereke wanted to leave individual listeners space to make their own conclusions, but has admitted that the record "operates in the realm of cultural politics"" And Common Dreads by Enter Shikari is viewed as sociopolitical  gt;"In Common Dreads, the band's lyrical subjects concern socio-political topics, like in "Step Up", a song that critiques free world trade. The song "No Sleep Tonight" speaks about the ecological situation of today. The song "Fanfare for the Conscious Man" contains lyrical connotations to the injustice of the various wars the government were engaging in whilst Enter Shikari were writing the album, the line, "Our gracious queen should grasp her crown, and take a good fucking swing at Blair and Brown" confirms the anti-war views of this song. The band expresses further political ideas in the song "Juggernauts" where the closing line is; "The idea of community will be something displayed in a museum", when coupled with the anti-capitalist and hopeless tone of previous lyrics, can be interpreted as a Pro-Collectivist stance." What's the difference? Aren't they both just talking about problems in society? Is the only difference being social commentary focuses on a group or individual and sociopoltical focuses on a nation?</TEXT>

    <TEXT>For example, Skyrim has only stayed relevant for this long because of the modding community. If there weren't any mods for the game, it probably would have died a year after release. Fallout 4 is honestly quite shit without mods. It tries to mix being an RPG with being an FPS and the result is a watered down version of both genres. I'm sick of people saying Skyrim is a great game if you pick out the right mods. It's a buggy mess without mods. If you need mods for it to be playable, then it's a bad game.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Humans take 18 years to grow from a baby to an adult. Cats which have a much shorter lifespan only take a whole year. It would make sense for Elves who live for hundreds of years to take hundreds of years to reach maturity. For example, if your average elf lives for 800 years, it would make sense for the elf to not be considered an adult until they're around 250 and their maturity reflects. Like if an elf is 200 years old, they're portrayed as being young and naive.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I don't mean in terms of race, but white history. Medieval castles, dragons, the whole political system (kings/jarls), the wildlife, the wilderness. All of it just screams medieval europe. It just lacks a certain charm that Morrowind has imo. It's a fantasy world, but it doesn't feel alien. It doesn't have the same fascination that silt striders, mushroom houses, dwemer, bull netches etc have. It feels too familiar and safe. You've seen and read about it hundreds of times because its our own history/stories rather than one entirely fabricated. There's already stories of trolls, dragons, bandits, assassins etc. A story of a dunmer tribe who craft armour out of chitin and plate resin with scratchy voices living under a volcano that's slowly killing them... That's fresh.</TEXT>

    <DATE>2020-08-03 20:56:37</DATE>
    <TEXT>1. It's a much better decision to wait 2 years for the updated console. PSone, PS2 slim, PS3 slim, PS4 Pro, XBox 360 slim, XBox One X etc. If you want a more powerful and relevant console, it saves you having to buy the standard and updated version to just go ahead and buy only the updated version. 2. If you buy on release date, you have a new console with barely any games to play. What if you don't like any of the handful of games only available? You're fucked for 2-3 months. 3. By the time you buy the updated console, the games it launched with will have dropped significantly in price. For example, RDR 2 is only  #163;15 now. Would you rather pay full price for one game or get 3 games for  #163;15?</TEXT>

    <TITLE>Why is circumcision so popular in the US?</TITLE>
    <DATE>2020-08-05 05:24:10</DATE>
    <TEXT>Body mutilation/modification goes against Christianity and the US is heavily Christian. Also the foreskin is there to prevent disease. A dirty uncircumcised penis would be a dirty circumcised penis because the person behind the penis is the problem, not the foreskin. Not to mention the area it was circumcised would be more prone to infection than an uncircumcised penis. Then there's also the build up of keratin (calluses) which causes lack of sensation after decades of rubbing since the glans are now forced to be an external organ and rub against clothing. Not to mention it disrupts pH balance. There's no positives to circumcision other than some people believing it looks nicer. I can't see someone veing rejected because they're uncircumcised. That's like rejecting someone because they have puffy nipples. There's enough interest to make it to the bedroom, I doubt being uncut or cut would be a dealer breaker. Even if it was, she's done you a favour by leaving, because that's shallow af. Why is it so common? Like, imagine if people started performing a labiaplasty on their daughters because "its cleaner." Everyone would be in uproar. Just have a shower, it's not hard.</TEXT>

    <DATE>2020-08-06 00:33:11</DATE>
    <TEXT>Dogs have a smell and you can smell if someone is a dog owner by their smell. Cats have a smell and you can do the same with cats. People also have a natural smell. This is unique though because everyone smells different and has their own natural smell. My mum smells like dry sugar puffs (a cereal), my step dad smells like pickled onions, my brother smells like sun cream etc. I can even notice my own smell, I smell like cannabis and fresh ham for whatever reason. So humans have a natural smell and that footprint can extend for quite a distance. I live in a three storey house and on the top floor, I can smell who's sitting in the living room based on what I can smell coming downstairs. I can tell the direction of the smell and who's sitting in the living room and who's sitting in the kitchen. This only works for people I'm familiar with since I obviously need to correlate the smell with the person, so because of this I can also smell if there's strangers (unfamiliar smells) in the house. So I understand **why** I can do this, but is it normal? Can most people do this? I've asked people and they look at me like I'm weird, but personally I think everyone does this on a daily basis without realising they're doing it.</TEXT>

So with skin being as thin as this, why does something like falling on gravel only leave a minor abrasion rather than major skin loss such as an avulsion?</TEXT>

    <TITLE>Why do some people exclusively only wear anything that gives them max DT?</TITLE>
    <DATE>2020-08-07 07:04:43</DATE>
    <TEXT>For example, what's the point of wearing power armour? It looks cool, but you run painfully slow with it on compared to light armour. It's also overkill, basically playing on god mode once you put the armour on. Might as well lower the difficulty to very easy while you're at it. It's gamebreakingly (is that a word?) OP. Power armour just feels unnecessary and feels impractical. The extra DT isn't worth slower movement speed. Unless you wanna punch deathclaws, what's the point? The same with daedric armour in Skyrim. You don't need it. There's people who play on master difficulty with just mage robes. I'm on adept with fine clothes and haven't died once yet. Instead of experimenting with different sets, why would someone just pick the best possible armour in the game and go with that? I personally love badlands raider armour with an unmodded hunting rifle in New Vegas. Gives a Mad Max feel to my character. Which imo is far better than staying with the elite riot gear, sierra madre reinforced armour, T-51b power armour etc just because of the DT. Tl;dr stop being a pussy and wear something creative.</TEXT>

    <TITLE>Why is female sexualisation in media viewed as bad?</TITLE>
    <DATE>2020-08-07 09:14:30</DATE>
    <TEXT>In comics, video games, films etc people are typically depicted as being perfect. By this I mean men will be the height of manliness. Look at Bruce Wayne... 6'3 chiseled jaw, deep masculine voice, physical peak condition etc. His standards are unrealistic but they're intentionally unrealistic because he's supposed to be portrayed as powerful, manly etc. You're not supposed to be able to relate to him. He's supposed to be above you. The same goes for women. Women leads are depicted as "the perfect feminine form". They don't have massive boobs, but they have perky, healthy boobs. Having medium sized full breasts is seen as a sign of good health/nourishment. They are still powerful and in peak physical condition. They have abs to show off. You could argue their outfits are skimpy but so are men's. Again with Batman, you can see every crevice in his body, his suit is skin tight. Just because Batman isn't showing off any skin, doesn't mean his outfit isn't skimpy or sexualised. Look at a latex goth or dominatrix. Heavily sexualised, but barely showing any skin. Women in media aren't adhering to the male fantasy. They're adhering to what is perceived to be the ideal woman. Not just by standards men have set, but women as well. People often don't think about females sexual attraction to women. They typically like the same thing men like. So what I'm trying to say is women are portrayed as they are for all of the same reasons men are portrayed as they are. They are supposed to be viewed as sexual symbols. They are supposed to be attractive. They aren't supposed to be relatable. They aren't supposed to have a physique that's easy to achieve. They're drawn that way because that's their intent. To be a physically perfect male/female. The women complaining about this don't seem to have a problem with the standards men are set to in games and rarely touch on it. So it appears to be a sexist thought of "Men don't need to cover up, but women do. Women showing skin is immoral." Which is absurd because they're literally being sexist to their own gender.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I disagree with your view in the female ideal being entirely fabricated by the male fantasy. There are men who prefer smaller breasts, men who prefer chubby girls, men who prefer tall girls etc. Lesbians don't like women with perky/full breasts because it's the norm. It's because we're hardwired to view it as healthy/have a natural allure/attraction. They don't prefer women with hourglass figures because it's what is the norm. They prefer it because, well... Why would they prefer a masculine waist? They're lesbians. I'm not speaking for all lesbians. I'm just saying in general/what most people like/the common preference etc.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Whenever I'm writing music on piano, everything is wrote in C natural minor. Whenever I write anything on guitar it's in E natural minor (aeolian). I know other scales, it's just hard to break away from writing in my comfort zone. I don't know how.</TEXT>

    <TITLE>Is there a name for when you pluck chords instead of doing a down or upstroke so every note is played at the same time?</TITLE>
    <DATE>2020-08-12 15:54:53</DATE>
    <TEXT>For example the chord C 7 G 8 C 8 My thumb would pluck the bottom string, my index finger would pluck the 5th string and my middle finger plucking the 4th. Sometimes I'd create a peddle not by plucking the bottom string, then the 5th and 4th at the same time. C----7-----7 G----8-----8 C 8-----8 I'm aware it's just a power chord, but I'm talking about the plucking. Is it just called "plucking chords"? Pizzicato maybe? Idk.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I frequently play like this but have no idea how to write it down in terms of  #8593;  #8595;. I strum with my thumb and index finger at the same time. My thumb does a downstroke on the first 3 strings and my index finger does an upstroke on the last 3 strings. So if a I played a C chord, my fingers would be hitting them in this order e----0 B-----1 G------0 D---2 A--3 E-0 That's neither an upstroke or a downstroke.</TEXT>

    <TEXT> gt;I actually remember learning about this when I was younger. In fact, I remember getting mildly annoyed during social studies or history class when my teacher kept using the word negro instead of black because I thought she had so much initial stress on it that I thought she was doing it to take a piss. I made a light hearted sarcastic imitation of it to the girl next to me. Apparently, that girl had asked the teacher about it the day before and back when she was growing up the black people didnt like being called black and preffered negro. Anyway, this whole discussion about words and their connotation is quite interesting.  gt;In American society, while the word negro wasn't used in as racially charged slurs as the other, it was the word the oppressor/the Man/the Other traditionally used to name blacks in America through slavery and segregation and beyond. (That's a whole other ELI5.) "Black" (not necessarily capitalized) doesn't have those same connotations and is also the term people choose to call themselves. Also, "negro" is almost a 'dated' word in America's use of the English lexicon; it has archaic tones in relation to current American society and terminology and has fallen out of general use and favor in our language.  gt;That's not really the issue. The word "Black" was used far more offensively during the years of slavery than "Negro", and during the Civil Rights movement many civil rights proponents including MLK and Malcom X would use the word Negro, talking abougt "The Negro Struggle" and such. A quick search on "is negro offensive"</TEXT>

    <TITLE>Why do vampires kill each other so often?</TITLE>
    <DATE>2020-08-16 17:27:57</DATE>
    <TEXT>If you're outnumbered by mortals, it would make sense to keep close together and form some kind of diplomacy among vampires and even send vampires to turn other mortals like what Vingalmo has you do. Why do Volkihar vampires plot against each other? Why do other vampires attack Volkihar vampires? Why do vampires attack me when I'm a vampire? Seems a bit counter-productive. I know why they attack you in-game but is there any lore reasons why you're not auto-assigned to a vampire faction where vampires are friendly with you?</TEXT>

Lesser vampires don't care for their own kind and offer each other as a sacrifice etc. They all just destroy each other.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>No. It's humour. A lot of people hate that kind of humour, but I've had just as many people find it funny. Look at black comedy. A lot of people are offended by it, but look at Frankie Boyle on a live set, the audience are laughing despite him picking out the audience with things like "I could watch you being raped and not feel a flicker of emotion." Audience erupts with laughter. Humour is subjective, but what I'm asking is why do people hate sarcasm when there's nothing initially offensive about it?</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I just call it the "dad voice" because that's where I recognize and adopted it from. It's an authoritative kind of tone but also angry. It's like when someone remains calm, but you can feel anger in their voice despite their voice not raising in volume. Like when your parents scold you, but are calm. Emphasis will often be put on words such as "What are you doing? No, stop. **Look** at me. **What** are you doing?" It's basically like displaying anger/annoyance/displeasure without yelling and using tone and expressions to subtly signify that anger. The only word I can really describe is "authoritative" but I don't know if that does it justice.</TEXT>

    <DATE>2020-08-19 00:12:47</DATE>
    <TEXT>They're both basically "omnisexual". If you're attracted to men and women, there's no reason you wouldn't be attracted to MTF or FTM since it's someone who is in the between stage of transitioning to what you're attracted to. If you're bisexual, there's no reason you wouldn't be attracted to somebody who is gender queer on non-binary since they still have a binary sex and you're attracted to both of them. If you're bisexual, basically as long as it meets the criteria 1. It's human 2. It has a pulse 3. The person is legal 4. You're somewhat attracted to them Then you're basically attracted to everyone. Pansexual people follow that same criteria. Why are they seen as different? Gender is a spectrum but sex is binary and bisexual people are attracted to both sexes i.e everybody (just like pansexual people). It just lowkey annoys me when I tell someone I'm bisexual and they're like "Oh, nice. I'm pan" and I ask how it's different to being bisexual and they tell me they're attracted to everyone, not just men and women. Then I tell them I'm attracted to whatever I find attractive providing it's human and legal. They then tell me that makes me pan like them even though I'm clearly bi.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I asked this in r/nostupidquestions and got this "Both dilution and temperature will change the flavor but maybe your palette is more sensitive to a specific flavor that you don't like when that happens. Do you also have issues with cilantro? That is a genetic flavor issue that makes cilantro taste like soap, maybe you have something similar to the peat in some whiskeys that isn't apparent until its cold or watered down."</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Not only have I been successful with women, I know a lot of men who are successful with women. I'm not even that attractive, a solid 7. Slightly above average and that's just because I put effort in how I dress/smell/my hair etc. For men to get women, you just need to be funny/iinteresting Have something to talk about that isn't dull, be able to make a woman laugh etc. Men being successful in dating and finding it easy isn't a rare thing. The internet will just have you believe that. As well as women don't have it as easy as you'd like to believe. ~~Men won't just go for anyone (some men will, but they're usually simps).~~ No self-respecting man will just go for anyone that gives him the green light. They have to be attractive. As well as (unless you're looking for casual sex) there has to be an interesting personality there. Back to appearances. Unattractive women do exist and there are a lot of them. There's just as many women who have a hard time finding a boyfriend. I know people from school who 6 years later they've still never had a boyfriend. It's a confirmation bias. Similar to seeing people in your newsfeed thinking they have a better life than you when really all they post is the highlights from their life and you see none of the bad shit. Edit: Oh and for that guy who's comment got deleted who said women don't have to pay for meals. Neither do men. It's 2020. Loads of women treat guys without even being asked. Almost everyone tends to have disposable income now.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I identify as my biological gender which is male. However, I completely disregard my gender. Like it doesn't influence anything such as the way I dress, the way I act, mannerisms etc. Obviously I follow the law such as using the correct toilets/changing rooms. I just see social rules as invalid to me. Does this make me non-binary? I always thought non-binary is when you have this belief that gender doesn't exist.</TEXT>

Kinda like a therapy session with myself. Helps me understand my problems whether financial, social, organization etc. These aren't personalities. Just characters in my head. The characters kind of symbolise a certain person I need in my life such as a therapist, doctor, job coach etc. Then my brain is like "I'll give you the next best thing."</TEXT>

    <TITLE>Why is rape such an offensive word?</TITLE>
    <DATE>2020-08-23 06:43:08</DATE>
    <TEXT>For example if you're playing a video game with someone and you say "You're about to get raped" how is that offensive? Rape means a lot of things. One of the most common definitions being  gt;an act of plunder, violent seizure, or abuse; despoliation; violation: "they raped the countryside" It's not a one size fits all word. Like shit for example, it isn't just excretement, it's also comparing something to excretement or even just a general exclamation. When you say to someone in a gaming setting "You're about to get raped" it's basically just "I'm gonna dominate you" or "You're about to get rekt". It's not like you're making a rape joke. You're just using the word rape in place of dominated because that sounds kinda SM/kinky and it's weird.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>For example, cartoon violence such as Tom and Jerry is allowed to be shown because it's a cartoon. Comedic sexualisation such as the Devil's asscheeks in Cow and Chicken is one of the reasons it's never seen on Cartoon Network before 9pm.</TEXT>

Then the man bun started becoming popular in 2013 (I mean an actual man bun, not the tiny shaved ponytail weirdness). It seems everyone has started cutting their hair again.

    <DATE>2020-08-29 12:09:10</DATE>
    <TEXT>Guys are generally more hairy than girls. Guys generally have more ass hair than girls. Even though girls have less ass hair, they still tend to keep on top of it more than guys who almost never touch their ass hair. Why would you need to shave your ass hair? It's really simple if you think about it. You have 3 options really. 1. Shave your ass hair and be clean all the time. 2. Don't shave your ass hair and shower ever time you've been for a poop 3. Don't shave your ass hair and rub your shit into your ass hair every time you wipe like melted chocolate on a carpet It's gross. Why don't guys shave their ass hair? I'm asking as a guy who shaves his ass hair for this exact reason.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I've watched my step dad, my dad, my ex and a few other people who aren't used to 3D games play. So this is just what I've observed from watching their hands. When I game, the left analogue stick is almost always pointed forward. I use the camera to turn and the left stick just keep me moving. Think of it as a car. The left stick is just acceleration, the camera is steering. People who are new to 3D games don't do this. They try to move left and right with the left analogue stick which is a lot harder to do in combination with keeping the camera steady than if you were just using the left analogue stick to move forward and the camera to turn. So if you see someone struggling, share that with them. Keep the left stick forward, move around using the right stick. Turning the camera to look left and right while you're moving forward will cause your avatar to move in whatever direction you're looking. Change direction with your eyes, not your feet.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>It sounds like you're being too heavy on the right analogue stick. If you feel like it, give Skyrim another try but this time do this Left analogue stick: Keep it moving forward Right analogue stick: Barely touch it. Adjust it so you're looking straight ahead and then just loosely rest your thumb on it. Finely tweak it left and right when looking around. Try to make it so your sense of direction is in relation to where the character is looking, not where his feet are moving. Also there's the offchance you might find it easier to play with invert Y (up is down and down is up) I'm on of them. If it's still difficult, try toggling it on in the settings.</TEXT>

"I'm scared of kids" doesn't really equal "I have an irrational phobia of kids and being around them makes me extremely uncomfortable and stresses me out for no rational reason at all. I also see them as unclean and don't want to be around them whenever I can avoid it"</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Whenever I see people speak Japanese with English subtitles, the thing they're saying in English is something like "I like his expressionless face and the cat leaves it as is" and the actual words in Japanese takes around 10 seconds to say. Triple the length of time it would take to say in English. Basically... Why does it take so much longer to say the same sentence in Japanese than English? Japanese people sound like they're speaking really fast, but they're not. The words are just really long. Why?</TEXT>

    <TEXT> gt;Of course some of this dislike may come down to simple preference, but for those cilantro-haters for whom the plant tastes like soap, the issue is genetic. These people have a variation in a group of olfactory-receptor genes that allows them to strongly perceive the soapy-flavored aldehydes in cilantro leaves. I have this gene. If I drink whiskey, I enjoy it. If I put ice in it, it tastes like dish water. Doesn't matter if it's a low quality Jack Daniels or a quality Red Breast or Glenfiddich. It tastes disgusting the moment I add ice to it. Could the change in temperature cause a flavour similar to cilantro to come out? Is it this gene why I can't drink liqour with ice in it?</TEXT>

    <TITLE>Why are toys so bad now?</TITLE>
    <DATE>2020-09-10 20:40:39</DATE>
    <TEXT>I'm only 23 and looking at the toys my siblings have grown up with, they're objectively worse. For example, kinder eggs now just have a toy with two pieces that snap together. When I was a kid, it has 8+ parts that has to be placed together. It took around 5 minutes to build and needed a manual found in the capsule. You could argue it's to prevent choking, but worldwide only 10 children have ever choked on a kinder egg. The toy is in a massive capulse that's not only hard to swallow, but hard to open. Transformers don't have as many moving parts now and aren't as intricate. It used to take around 5 minutes to build the larger transformers, now they take a couple of seconds. It isn't just because I'm older either, I'm talking about transforming them now looking back on transformers I kept from my childhood. The smaller transformers are also simpler too requiring moving only 2 pieces for it to transform. Back in 2005 McDonald's had transformers more advanced than that and only cost  #163;2 for the Happy Meal. These things cost  #163;7 and transform in two steps. Speaking of McDonald's, Happy Meals too. You used to get decent toys with them. For example the transformers [from 2002](https://i.ytimg.com/vi/jeH4ju23uQg/maxresdefault.jpg) I mentioned earlier or [these video games](https://i.redd.it/alckxugh10w31.png) or [these video games](https://i.pinimg.com/originals/27/e0/71/27e07194d0eefb645ec69a780d47aa8e.jpg) or Beyblades are terrible now. They used to look like [this](https://vignette.wikia.nocookie.net/beyblade/images/1/16/Turbo_g.jpg/revision/latest/scale-to-width-down/340?cb=20111129110656) and came with 6 parts you could swap out with each other. Very customisable. Now they're a solid object that doesn't come apart. Also some of the metal rings had bits of flint on them that created sparks when they came into contact with a brick wall or other beyblades. It was cool af when you were 8. Now they don't have that. Toys are just trash now. Why?</TEXT>

    <TEXT>So, the Gaboon viper has the largest venom delivery by volume of bite (King cobra in second place) and the black mamba has the most potent venom out of any snake (King cobra also in second place). So between these 3 snakes, which bite is deadlier? I'm aware they can all kill within less than a minute, I'm just asking to entertain the pointless question</TEXT>

    <TEXT>A lot of wild cats such as lynx, cheetahs and snow leopards have no interest in humans and only engage when threatened. I've seen YouTube videos of people who have cared for tigers for well over a decade and they seem tame when you're experienced and know how to handle them. Apparently (outside of rare cases of man eating tigers) they only snap when cornered or resource guarding. Apparently mountain lions are hyper aggressive and will always be the aggressor, but I've also heard this about tigers. I'm not asking which can kill a human most easily, I'm asking about their temperament. Which is most likely to attack a human?</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Is it some kind of opiate like morphine? For example if you're sat in a restaurant waiting for your food. You can smell food all around and you and it's making you excited for the meal. That's dopamine. If you smoke and you are craving a cigarette, that's dopamine. Dopamine is the chemical that gives you the drive to do something. Rats without dopamine won't go out searching for food and will only eat when food is put in front of them. It's the motivation chemical. So what chemical is that reward? The pleasure you get from finally tucking into your food? The pleasure you get from the first drag of a cigarette etc? Is that morphine?</TEXT>

    <TEXT>It's the norm for men to be interested in fashion. Fashion caters to the male gaze just as much as it does to women. Look at brands like Emporio Armani and Hugo Boss. It's normal for men to take pride in their appearance. Going way back into the 50's successful men were well dressed and groomed. Manscaping is normal. Barbers have been styling beards for centuries. If caring about your appearance makes you a metrosexual, does that mean all other men are slobs who don't look after themselves? It seems odd that a term was made up to describe the majority.</TEXT>

Fear of being in the sea, being near the sea, being in large bodies of water, fear of animals in the water, fear of sailing etc. They're not even remotely close to each other.

    <TITLE>Why are people scared of spiders?</TITLE>
    <DATE>2020-09-25 22:32:52</DATE>
    <TEXT>I keep hearing the same bs answers of "through natural selection" "our ancestors survived by being scared of them" "it's a primal fear" etc. This isn't a loaded question or a rant. I'm explaining why this premise is nonsensical and asking for sensible answer that isn't halfarsed. Humans killed by animals per year Mosquitos: 1,000,000 deaths per year Humans: (murders) 475,000 dpy Snakes: 50,000 dpy Dogs: 25,000 dpy Tsetse flies: 10,000 dpy Spiders don't even make it in the top 10 with only 7 deaths per year. They are not a threat. Even something extremely venomous such as a Sydney funnel web spider. It's highly unlikely to just walk up to you and bite you just for the sake of it. You're not food to spiders. It knows you're too big to even attempt killing. Spiders still have a self-preservation instinct. They aren't gonna fuck with something that titans them in comparison unless cornered of threatened. I mean wasps do, but those are eusocial. Spiders are not. So what is the real reason we're scared of spiders? It's clearly nothing to do with survival because their threat level is trivial. People are scared of bats. Less than a tenth of a percentage of bats have rabies and yet they still evoke fear. Dogs are more likely to bite, give you rabies **and** kill you than a bat or a spider combined and yet there's fewer people scared of dogs.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>What I'm trying to say is if someone is scared of a spider and doesn't have any traumatic experiences with them, the fear obviously comes from what the spider looks like rather than its threat level since it's threat level is minimal. We could simply step on it and the threat is erased. So what is it about the way a spider looks that makes so many people hate them?</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Brown recluse and black widows are the only medically significant spider in the US though and they are highly unlikely to kill. Also a brown recluse bite only turns to necrosis when left untreated for weeks. If you treat it immediately, you'd only have painful swelling for a couple of days. If a black widow bites somebody with a normal immune system, you're looking at vomiting, muscle tightness and tremours but in no case are you going to die. Only a small percentage of black widow bites lead to death (not even 1 death per year) and it's usually the elderly, pets or babies.</TEXT>

It wasn't exactly bullying, because they didn't target people weaker than them. They didn't care who they were fighting as long as they got to fight. A lot of times it's blatent assault though because they'd keep pestering you for a fight, insulting you trying to get you riled up to take the first swing, then when you still walk away they'd just take a swing. This didn't end in school. Now at 23 I still see groups of 16-21 year olds hanging around stores targetting people to have a fight with them.</TEXT>

    <DATE>2020-09-28 23:01:49</DATE>
    <TEXT>They don't really interact with you like a mammal or a bird would. Insects are basically just expensive decorations. You hold a tarantula and all it's probably thinking is "This is a weird tree man!" Even with extremely intelligent spiders such as regal spiders, they just see you as a moving surface to climb on. With snakes, they have 3 modes. They either wanna eat you, think you wanna eat them and fear you or they see you as a source of warmth. Most snakes will skip the first two and move straight to coiling around you to stay warm, but it's not really affection is it? It's basically using you as a rock to bask on for warmth. The lack of interaction is why I don't understand the appeal. It's basically like having a complex tamagotchi. Edit: Because I know it will get said **I know** arachnids aren't insects.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Tech has a way of creeping into our life and becoming a necessity. Nobody had any need for a mobile phone in the 80's. You'd rarely have bosses calling you. You wouldn't need to call anywhere to get a job, it was all done via handing a resum #233;/CV into the workplace etc. Then it got to the point where to find work you had to be on your phone with a Yellow Pages book. Your boss would harass you over the phone asking if you can make it into work. Working on call started becoming more common etc. Everybody has a mobile phone now. Everybody has a number now. Then phonecalls became replaced with emails. You now need an email address if you want a job. You apply to places through websites such as Indeed. Your primary way of contacting your manager is through email etc. Everybody has an email address now. So what if RFID chips replaced currency? You go to work and earn credits on your chip. You pay for things by scanning your hand and credits are deducted. Or maybe instead of currency your RFID chip holds crucial information such as your medical history, your criminal record, your passport etc.</TEXT>

Whether positive or negative, it's giving you information and telling you a message and there's hundreds of clones of this same message that have been reposted ad infinitum which causes rapid fire of the same message, essentially molding your opinion and even your way of thinking via repetition (e.g memes have completely destroyed my sense of humour to the point where "E" is funny).

    <TITLE>Not liking vegetables as an adult isn't childish</TITLE>
    <DATE>2020-10-03 08:10:01</DATE>
    <TEXT>Some people have a texture aversion, some people just really don't like the taste regardless of how it's prepared or cooked. Some people don't like the smell, I absolutely hate the smell of cauliflower. Smells like literal farts. It also doesn't make you unhealthier. You can get all the vitamins you're not getting from vegetables in other foods such as eggs, nuts, seeds, grains etc. Diet isn't the only thing that makes you healthy or unhealthy. How many obese vegans have you seen? The real childishness is asserting your opinions on other people. Having some heightened sense of superiority because you eat something other people don't like. Most people like vegetables, that doesn't mean that everyone is obliged to like them to not be seen as childish. It's not as simple as just eating it until you like it. I could be in a situation where the only thing left to eat is vegetables and I would choose to starve to death. That isn't childish, it's knowing I wouldn't enjoy my life if that's the only food that was available. I know what I like and what I don't like, what's wrong with that? In cases where someone has a sensory aversion or ARFID it's on the same level as calling someone a literal manchild for not eating fish because they're allergic to it. It doesn't kill someone with sensory aversion to eat vegetables, but it causes them distress and physical responses such as vomiting. My gag reflex kicked in when I felt adventurous and tried a tomato. I threw up the moment I bit into it. I tried eating a sprout once and my throat closed up and I literally couldn't swallow it. It's more than just "I don't like it."</TEXT>

I had no preconceived notions of "vodka is stronger than whiskey so it's going to get me drunk faster" I thought "40% is 40% so it will be the same" so there was no placebo effect. I drink vodka a little slower than whiskey because the taste is harsher despite getting drunk faster with vodka than whiskey. To reinforce that it is not a placebo, I genuinely believed I would get more drunk from an 18 year old whiskey than a 7 year old whiskey. I still didn't get drunk from an 18 year old Glenfiddich despite thinking I would, so it is absolutely not a placebo effect.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>The NES, the original GameBoy, any keyboard from the 90's, old PC's, the original PlayStation and PSone, those mice that had the ball underneath. All of them are a disgusting gray colour. Why not white since plastic is basically a milky white when it's first made? They really were beige, they weren't white and it just yellowed from age. I remember when my school first got computers in 2001 and all the Dell PC's were a disgusting beige colour.</TEXT>

    <TITLE>Why did game companies in the 70's and 80's have ridiculous names?</TITLE>
    <DATE>2020-10-09 08:20:04</DATE>
    <TEXT>Magnavox Odyssey is probably the only name that works. Single word for their product. Odyssey. Can be interpreted to mean adventure. Sells their product as something that's fun. For example, compare the name "Atari VCS/2600 Sears Video Arcade" to "Atari Jaguar". Which one sounds more appealing as a game console? PlayStation. A station that plays games. The name is simple, memorable and sells. Something like "NEC TurboGrafx-16" doesn't sell and it came out in the same generation as the PS1. Nintendo, Sony and Microsoft all have names that can be abbreviated too. PS5, XBone, SNES etc. Why were names like "Mattel Intellivision" a thing? Mattel sounds like somewhere you buy kitchen appliances from. Tl;dr why were game companies in the 1970's and 80's so piss poor at marketing?</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I don't mean when people are completely hammered and slurring. I mean when they're just buzzed on alcohol. There's a noticeable change in their voice. Louder, less monotonous, more colourful, sometimes even comedic. Sometimes it gets a bit bouncy and enthusiastic. It's not like they're happier. A person who's drunk sounds different to when they're happy. It's like happiness mixed with excitement but also the mask falls and they're just being themselves. Like there's less of a filter on not being weird.</TEXT>

Sony and Microsoft have released a digital only PlayStation 5 and the XBox Series S. I suspect this is to prepare us for consoles potentially moving to being completely digital with the next gen in 2026-2027. However, people still buy movies when they're first released. Second hand shops such as CEX still sell new movies that people have traded in. I saw hundreds of copies of Joker around 3 weeks after it came out.

    <TEXT>Female hyenas have more testosterone than male hyenas. Not only do they have more testosterone, they have so much testosterone that their vaginas resemble a penis, as in they have a large clitoris that connects to the womb and bladder, operating [much like penis](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Gerald_Cunha/publication/7825103/figure/fig3/AS:752872702636034@1556510248834/Drawing-of-a-pregnant-female-spotted-hyena-with-a-fetus-in-a-uterine-horn-A-segment-of.png) Because of this, with how much of a tight and long squeeze it is to get the cub out, 60% of all first time mothers end up having a stillbirth from suffocation as well as many mother's don't make it themselves through childbirth complications. How are their numbers so steady?</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I can drink a super sized mug of coffee and effortlessly get 8 hours sleep right after drinking it. I don't know if it's because it's a warm drink, but coffee is just relaxing. Feel good chemicals. Coffee also doesn't wake me up. I don't know if it's because I naturally wake up feeling alert but I don't feel **more alert** when I drink it. Just the physical stuff like faster heart rate. I know most people's knee jerk reaction would be "tolerance" but I've never reacted to coffee. I started drinking tea when I was 2-3 and started drinking coffee when I was around 8. My parents have told me it never turned me into a gremlin that couldn't stay still. Edit: spelling.</TEXT>

    <TITLE>When your favourite AC game is the first game and you know it isn't going to get a remaster because most people don't care about it</TITLE>
    <DATE>2020-10-15 16:35:18</DATE>
    <TEXT>It's my favourite for a few reasons. - feels most like a simulation. No health, only synchronisation meter. Ezio's trilogy removed this with health portions, but it came back in the Kenway Sega. - You don't need to buy anything. Your equipment and skills upgrade just from advancing the story - Other than flags which were put in there as a joke (the devs admitted to just wanting to know if anyone was stupid enough to bother collecting all of them) there's no pointless collectables littering the map - No weird side content that detracts from the main story where you're like "Why am I making furniture? Why am I buying shops? Why am I beating up husbands?) etc. Side content should add to the story imo e.g glyphs in AC2 and Brotherhood. - You feel more like an assassin in this game than any else. Strict order who always abide by the tentants. Solid gameplay that's simple. Survey, collect enough info, assassinate, flee, repeat. - I feel like Alta #239;r had the strongest character progression, Edward being a close second. - No microtransactions. The game just stayed pure to being what it was advertising itself as and I love that. I'm not saying it is flawless. It has a lot of flaws. Mainly in the parkour not being as responsive. A lot of people make out like this game is unplayable though. Maybe it's because it was my first AC game, but I went back to it 2 days ago and it's still just as good as I remember. Definitely not unplayable. Repetitive, yes but it's kinda supposed to be. It's the design. You're supposed to be a real character doing his job as an assassin which would be repetitive. It's repetitive because it's trying to retract from being fictional. Just kinda sad knowing it's never gonna get a remaster. Edit: I also love the minimalism. MD only has continue|quit. Main menu is minimalistic. Gameplay UI is minimal with only a sync bar and a map with only the most important info. Just feels more immersive where you're not looking at the UI all the time and focusing on the actual game instead.</TEXT>

It can kind of be explained, I mean you could argue it's because we're playing as Desmond so the voice we're hearing is Desmond's imagining of what Alta #239;r sounded like and that's why everyone speaks English in the games.</TEXT>

The M in ATM means machine so you don't have to clarify it's a machine. It's just an ATM. Same with the N in PIN. It's just PIN. Adding "number" to the end is pointless. Sahara means desert.

    <TEXT>I'm not saying they're universally comfier for everyone. They're just more comfortable to me. They're worse than the XBox One controller with their crappy D pad (kinda got better with the transforming D pad) but the contour is perfect for my hands. I also love having the home button in the centre rather than at the top. Less reach to press the button (and I have massive hands). To press the home button on the XBox One controller, I'd have to take my hand away a little bit from the right grip to press it. I don't have to do this with the 360. I also love having a battery pack on the bottom without having a flush pack because I don't like my hands touching each other when playing. XBox One controller also feels more angular and less curvy imo. I don't like it. If there was a and XBox 360 elite controller that had the additional buttons the XBox Series X controller has as well as the adjustable analogue sticks and adaptive triggers, it would be my perfect controller.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>That's interesting. I make up stories about the people I'm talking to on the fly. For example say I'm in a kik group and there's someone called Alva, I'd say something like "Alva wasn't always called Alva. She once went by the name of Amoztli Ixtaccihuatl, 'The White Book' in our tongue. She was a fierce warrior for the Chalca tribe and would fight bravely. She was captured by the enemy tribe of Tlahuica where her head was sliced off with a dull khukiri and her body burned to ash. She remembers this pain well and still continues to lurk around the chat rooms of kik enacting her revenge until she some day becomes powerful enough to return to her mortal form. The only way to truly destroy Alva forever is to set fire to the shruken head crafted from her remains."</TEXT>

    <TEXT>It has better parkour than the newer games but imo Revelations has the best parkour. AC1 feels too slow. Oftentimes I would be dangling on a ledge because I'm not in the right area to climb up, so I have to shuffle ever so slightly to pull myself up. I'd find myself getting stuck in a corner often too having to run up a wall and back jump off the wall to get out. The parkour in the Kenway saga is really nice too. I didn't like Unity. Too fast, felt like you were spiderman and looked a bit weird like frames were cut out of the climbing animations.</TEXT>

    <TITLE>What's faster at transferring information, USB-C or USB 3.0?</TITLE>
    <DATE>2020-10-17 23:30:58</DATE>
    <TEXT>My external hard drive connects via USB to [micro USB 3.0](https://static.bhphoto.com/images/images1000x1000/1551263714_1458266.jpg) (not to be confused with [micro USB](https://cdn.alza.co.uk/ImgW.ashx?fd=f3 amp;cd=MK070p1) and it got me thinking about how it compares to [USB-C](https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/61ZY5jcW3BL._AC_SX569_.jpg). Which one is faster, USB-C or USB 3.0?</TEXT>

    <TITLE>Assassin's Creed 1 is the only AC game that feels challenging</TITLE>
    <DATE>2020-10-18 23:18:17</DATE>
    <TEXT>You start out with only a sword and a hidden blade. By the end you only have an extra short dagger and some throwing knives. Travelling through Kingdom requires you to blend otherwise you will be engaged in combat at very early levels when you have like 5 bars of health and can't ~~combo~~ counter kill. Guards get suspicious easily and the suspicion lasts quite a while before you're safe to exit blend, oftentime needing to be far away from the scene of the crime. Guards get even more suspicious later on in the game where the only way to survive is to blend. Enemies feel smarter. They often go to grab you but it's a bluff to break your defense for another enemy to attack. There's no health. You gotta exit combat and wait for sync to regenerate or be doing so well in combat that sync isn't an issue. Climbing towers felt more like puzzles. Getting around guard postings was more like a puzzle. AC1 is basically the only entry in the series that is a social stealth game. I noticed this as soon as I finished it and went to AC2 and suddenly I can walk around guards clearly dressed as an Assassin. The suspicion metre was dumbed down to be replaced with notoriety which makes the game easier IMO, just keep it below  #190; and you're fine. As well as rather than having specific hiding places, you can just tail people and hide that way. Beggars are no longer a challenge because you can just throw money at them then they were removed entirely in Revelations iirc. Tl;dr the game hasn't been remotely challenging since AC1. It AC2 turned it into a power fantasy rather than a social stealth action. It feels like there's no consequence to your failure as if the game just wants you to play it however you want because it doesn't have the balls to tell you it's a stealth game and you're gonna play it like a fucking assassin or you're gonna have a bad time. Edit: game terminology</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Counter attacking is only useful in the "nobody saw if nobody was alive to see" mentality. Actually trying to stay out of sight of guards and picking off guards on rooftops to navigate (especially when you don't have throwing knives yet) is hard. AC1 is one of those games where although it is challenging to stay undectected, it's more rewarding because fighting guards every 2 minutes sucks ass.</TEXT>

    <TITLE>Why does betting on greyhounds sometimes pay out a lot and sometimes pay out nothing?</TITLE>
    <DATE>2020-10-19 09:45:02</DATE>
    <TEXT>First time I ever bet on greyhounds, I had  #163;1288 by the time I fininished. I bet a reversal on 2, 4 and 5 and they all came out in front, winning me  #163;1,000 from a  #163;3 bet. It got to the point my winnings was funding my gambling and I was spending the sites money instead of my own. Then the next day I get 2 would finish 1st and 1 would finish 2nd. Very specific, but it won. All I won back was  #163;4 out of a  #163;2 bet. Now I'm winning an average of  #163;1.50 at a time. Why?</TEXT>
