    <TITLE>Period pain?</TITLE>
    <DATE>2019-11-01 00:32:11</DATE>
    <TEXT>Still waiting for official diagnosis (can't get to my GI until February) but everyone's very sure it's crohn's. Does anyone else have a history of getting bowel pain passed off as period pain? When I first started getting my period my cycle always had horrific cramps through my abdomen to my anus. Every doctor passed it off as period pain, regardless of where it happened in my cycle. I've been using IUDs for 10 years now (just got my 3rd in) and don't have periods anymore but the pain is still there and it's always followed by bad bowel movements. Looking back, I've had this my whole life without realising that what was happening to me wasn't normal. I was told as a kid everyone bleeds when they poop sometimes, and not to worry about it. Years of growing pains in my joints. Years of resistant reflux that gets worse when I'm having bowel issues. Years of iron deficiency (I was about 13 when I had my first liquid iron supplement). Because it was all stuff I thought was normal I hadn't mentioned it to my GP or GI until earlier this year. My GP was horrified that none of this had been investigated.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I've been planning a weekend away with my mother for months now. It's been the one thing in my horrifically bad life that's kept me going. Went to sort out the finances for it today. To find out I can only get half of what I need. It's my fault for relying on my government benefits advance payment system (yay centrelink) but it's always been $650. Every 6 months for over 5 years. Now it's just over $300. This apparently is the last straw of my coping strength. I'm sitting on my kitchen floor fighting the urge to touch my oven racks that have been preheating for awhile. This is what I deserve I guess.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I've been having a really bad year. And the last few nights have really shown my girlfriend over nearly 8 years doesn't really love me. She can't. Or she wouldn't say the shit she did. How the hell can u be blamed for her daughter abusing me? I hadn't said a word to the spoilt bitch and she started on me. And now I'm the problem? She made it pretty clear she's fed up with me being sick. Currently dealing with an undiagnosed chronic illness, most likely crohn's disease and apparently the depression caused by the fact I'm fucking terrified is bringing everyone down? I can be sure all she's going to focus on when I pick her up from work (11pm pick up again. Because she's 45 and doesn't have a licence) is that I cut. Won't matter if I'm crying. That gets ignored. She literally told me if I have issues to talk to my psych. 90% of my appointments is trying to cope with her kids. Because they're killing me. It's all killing me. I'm usually casually suicidal. Tonight I'm trying to fight the real urges. So many options to me. Eeny meeny miny Moe.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>My SO is a huge shepherds/cottage pie lover, especially over winter but whenever I make one it's always super oily (I'm assuming, runny orange liquid). I've tried using different grades of mince (ground) and different types (beef, veal, lamb, veal/pork mix). Using lean mince often turns out too dry and doesn't have a lot of flavour. I've tried draining the meat after cooking, using no oil when cooking. Is it just the way it has to be? Made on from Gordon Ramsay's book tonight, and while it was freaking yummy it was still super oily.</TEXT>

    <DATE>2019-11-16 11:44:55</DATE>
    <TEXT>For years I've struggled with reflux, diagnosed as GERD. But after tracking my symptoms closely this year I'm finding my reflux is worse when I'm ha ING bowel issues. Almost like the pressure /inflammation of the bowel is pushing the acid up and I often can't get relief until the bowel attack has passed (worse when I've got sticky mucus poop). Please tell me I'm not the only one? Doctors has been trying to solve my reflux for years and even on maximum doses of somac and (up until recently) rinitidine I've still needed antacids. My GI doesn't think it's a sphincter issue as he's done 3 or 4 upper scopes.</TEXT>

    <DATE>2019-11-18 11:41:21</DATE>
    <TEXT>I could post here every day. Every day I read a post here or on other groups with people talking about symptoms I never knew were not normal. Just learnt about erythema-nodosum, which I spent over 6 months with. Golfball sized lumps on my shins that nobody could explain or fix. They just put it down to a reaction to medication I was taking. FML. But the actual reason for this particular post is that I'm having more and more daily stabbing gut/bowel pain that nothing is helping. It happens just before I need to poop and I'm pooping a billion times a day. I can almost follow the poop pain down the length of the bowel. If I lived anywhere else I'd take myself to the ER because I'm getting scared, but my city has no GI. They'd stick me on a saline drip, give me some painkillers that won't help and send me home. Because I'm not bleeding horrifically they'll once again tell me it's period related. My GP agrees with me that there's no point in going because I'll end up being labelled a drug seeker or hypochondriac. Fuck this. Fuck not having an official diagnosis. Fuck not being able to get the right help.</TEXT>

    <TITLE>Your significant other does not have to be available 24/7!</TITLE>
    <DATE>2019-12-03 23:48:11</DATE>
    <TEXT>So many threads in relationship advice subreddits are about someone not replying right away. Or texting 'enough'. Or being left 'on read'. Or just generally being unavailable by text/social media. This dependence on people being available 24/7 is not healthy for relationships. People need space. People need to be allowed to be busy without having to feel guilty, or like they have to justify it. People need to be allowed to not reply if they don't feel like it. Yes, sometimes it's a sign they're not into you, ghosting, drifting away, cheating, whatever. But often it's just they're busy. Or asleep. Or needing their own space. I've seen relationships end purely because someone didn't text enough, or within a certain time frame. (my teenager and her friends had a set limit and if guys didn't reply in that time frame they were dumped). So basically the dependence on people being available 24/7 is unhealthy and ridiculous.</TEXT>

    <DATE>2019-12-12 13:29:53</DATE>
    <TEXT>Just feeling so overwhelmed right now. My (34F) wife (45F) of nearly 8 years has 3 kids (28F, 24M, 18F) who are all major causes of chaos and stress in our lives. This will probably be jumbled. Sorry, it got so long. Right now the oldest is 28 weeks pregnant. To an abusive ice addict who had to be removed by police for DV. She's dated many of these 'men' this year. This week she went into early labour, which meant she had to be airlifted to a major hospital over 5 hours from us. We've got her 7 year old son while she's away, my SO can't take any more time off without losing her job. They've managed to stop the labour and are trying to get a flight to send her home, but then she has to come stay with us for a few weeks on partial bedrest. The middle child is a repeat registered sex offender. He was found with nudes of his (then) 14 year old girlfriend and over 5000 messages in 3 months that can't be called anything other than grooming. He got released from jail in august and while he can't come near us (he's legally banned from our city) he's still able to cause a fuck load of guilt for my partner. Youngest turns 18 this weekend. My SO's ex husband and the almost 18 year old went behind our backs to plan this almighty booze fest. At our house. We were never asked we were told. We've NEVER allowed drinking in our house. Neither of us drink but the teenager is a serious binge drinker, has been for about 3 years. The only thing she is excited about with her birthday is booze. Legal age here is 18. I don't want this at my house. I don't want 50+ drink people at my house. In my yard. Near my pets. She's horrifically spoilt, and will have many tantrums between now and her party. Like screaming tantrums. I've had to tell my SO I am not helping set this shit up. I'm paying for the food for this thing because that's how the finances worked out. We have separate finances because my partner has major impulse spending issues. This week most of her work pay went on rent, so I'm the only one with money to buy our groceries and the shit for the party. I know my partner will even it out next fortnight (usually she buys me art supplies) but I also know how ungrateful this kid is. My partner works as an aged care nurse, so works fucking hard for little thanks. She's back on probation with her boss because she's had over 70 days of sick leave/unpaid leave in 12 months. If she wasn't so good at her job they would have sacked her. She also has fibro which flares when she's stressed. She works evening shifts, 3pm-11pm. She doesn't drive, so I have to do work drop offs and pick up because we can't afford taxis that many times a week. I have bipolar and borderline personality disorder. Both are fairly well managed, but obviously stress makes things wobbly. Due to the work pick ups I can't take my night meds until after 11, so I'm usually still awake at 1-2am. Oldest step daughter is so useless she can't get her son to school (they're a 5 minute walk to his school) on time. So we've been doing his school drop off every morning. So I'm out of bed at 8 to do the driving for that. I'm also waiting to be diagnosed with crohn's disease. They're 90% sure that's what it is, I just can't get into my specialist until Feb next year. So I'm dealing with all the fun symptoms of that, a main one being fatigue. I'm trying to hold my partner together, so she can function. I'm more than happy to do that, that's what relationships are for. But I'm not able to hold myself together as well. My main support is my best friend, who lives on the other side of Australia and who my partner deeply resents. I'm sitting here at 12.20am after making sure my partner got a chance to debrief from work before she went to bed, to make sure my grandson was fed, showered and felt safe enough (he's having major trust/anxiety/abandonment issues due to the trauma of his mother's choice in boyfriends) to go to sleep. I've had to drop most of my hours at work, which is a job I absolutely adore, because I just can't handle juggling everything on top of being so exhausted all the time. Started at 30 hours a week. I'm down to 3-4, and I have to sleep for at least 4-5 after that. I'm tired, I'm sad, I'm exhausted, I'm anxious, I'm scared and I don't feel like I can add more shit to my partners list of stress so I'm keeping it to myself. I have my mother near by, but I can't be totally honest with her about most of this because her answer is always for me to move back in with them. My mother has mild Munchausen by proxy issues so loves the idea of having me back under her roof and sick. Due to everything happening this week I totally forgot about the appointment I had with my psychiatrist yesterday and that may come with a $250 missed appointment fee. And I can't get back to see her until January because she's off until then. I need a hug. Or to cut myself. Edit: I just accidentally snorted a bug up my nose which apparently is the last straw of my holding it together</TEXT>

Cook some garlic off in the bacon fat, then use that to make a roux. I then add cream to the roux until it's the texture I'm after. There's still something missing and I'm wondering if it could be white wine? I had a cream sauce recently that had Chardonnay and it was beautiful. I'm not someone who drinks, we don't have alcohol in the house (we have a boozy teen) and my partner isn't 100% sold on the idea that something like that will make much difference.  #8203; Any advice?

    <DATE>2019-12-28 09:38:25</DATE>
    <TEXT>I don't usually post or visit the subreddit, but I know it's going to be more likely to get answers than other quieter ones. My BPD is basically in remission. I don't act on my thoughts/impulses unless I'm insanely distressed. I'm also in a long term (almost 8 years) relationship that I've managed to stay faithful in. Which kind of brings me to my question. When ym BPD was out of control I was incredibly hypersexual, like a lot of us I guess. Sex was a way to control my life, relationships and emotions. But since I got myself a committed partner, one who I don't need to keep reeling back in, one who is sticking around, the idea of sex is just... Ugh. I have no libido, no drive and to be honest I don't remotely miss it. My partner is usually OK with our lack of sex (seriously it's been years) because she's had issues with men and sex for years, but sometimes I feel like she resents me. I can usually just play it off that it's because of my chronic illness because I know she won't understand that I just don't want sex, with her, with anyone. Please please tell me someone here gets it?</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I have a Lego and vehicle obsessed 7 year old grandson and as always there's just never enough wheels. We've picked up every bulk Lego sale from our local buy swap sell Facebook group but there's rarely wheels. Not looking to spend heaps (under $100) but eBay only has little 'bulk' sets. He's after different sizes and we don't have a Lego store near us. Any advice?</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I'm struggling. Big time. So I talk to my best friend who's known my over half my life. This pisses my partner off because she's got some irrational jealousy of my bestie. But if I try to talk to my partner she's always got shit worse. I'm struggling with an undiagnosed chronic illness that had been quite debilitating last year and will continue to be until I get some diagnosis. My partner has fibro. I know she's hurting constantly, that she's tired and works a fuck load more than I can right now. But working helps her fibro. If I tell her I'm in pain, or tired or fucking depressed because I feel so useless because I can barely work, I get reminded she has it worse. She's somehow forgotten the years I was the only one working.</TEXT>

Tired of having to be the bitch who reminds my partner that we don't need to buy more shit we're never going to use (seriously, I have a garage full of 'restoration projects' that we get rid of just to get more. Sick of being the bitch because I think a 7 year old needs to be told no and have it mean no. Not no and then giving in minutes later. Sick of watching my SO being abused by her 18 year old daughter and being told to just ignore it because there's nothing she can do about it. A product of never being told no. Tired of feeling like I can't talk to my partner about how much I'm struggling because she's struggling too, but still works 30+ hours a week when I can barely manage 4 right now. So I feel guilty for being sick. Undiagnosed chronic illness is bullshit and I think my partner thinks I'm exaggerating and I'm just lazy. Why am I even here?</TEXT>

    <DATE>2020-01-19 01:00:56</DATE>
    <TEXT>I've never seen this sub before, and I'm so please it exists because people just don't understand that it's not that i hate my step-kids, it's that they're so toxic I can't deal. I know a lot of the shit comes back to my SO's parenting style (or lack there of). I have 3 step kids and 2 and a half step grandsons. None of my own. My partner is their mother.  #8203; Starting with the oldest. 28 biologically, 16 mentally. She had a diagnosed mild intellectual delay, but is perfectly capable of living on her own. She has a 7 year old son and is a few weeks off popping out another kid. Because of her delay she's incredibly easy for guys to take advantage of. She had over 5 boyfriends last year (they got 'engaged within days every time) which doesn't sound like a lot until you realise she moves then in with her within a week. In the house her son is in. Without knowing the guy anywhere but facebook. Unsurprisingly she always meets drug addicts and abusers. Usually both. The father of her baby is an Ice user who was removed by police for going on an ice rage and trying to kill them both. Usually it doesn't ever matter what these guys do, she takes them back over and over every time. Her son rarely has real food when she's in these relationships because all her money goes on these guys. She won't listen to us, the police, children's services, women's aid or any mentor she's had through healthy relationship workshops, these guys love her end of story. She has over 15 AVOs out against boyfriends she's had over the last 5 years, including the father of her baby AND the one of her 7 year old.  #8203; Next in line is the 23 year old. Registered sex offender. Multiple offences. The hard part is all these girls are totally willing and consenting, but they're always 14/15. Last jail visit could have been 20 years for child porn and grooming a minor. But the girl did a victim statement saying how much she loves him, wants to marry him and how her parents supported the relationship. Which they did. They had moved him in with them. The police couldn't find evidence of actual sexual relations so couldn't get him on that. He's legally barred from our town. He has a beautiful 3 year old son he's seen twice. Thankfully the mother of the child lets us have a relationship with him. He has serious mental health issues, but refuses to do anything about it.  #8203; Then there's the newly turned 18 year old. Spoilt and entitled as hell. Has rarely ever been told no in her life. Never has consequences for her actions or words, which means she has no issues abusing everyone until she gets her way. My SO was sexually assaulted for year by the father of the oldest 2 kids, and this kid has NO hesitation using it against her. She never sincerely apologises for anything she says, because she feels she was 'standing up for herself' and is never in the wrong. She hates me because I do say no. I will NOT let her abuse me the way she does everyone else and still give her what she wants. All she wants from me is money and to be driven everywhere. NOPE, unless it's something my SO needs to be at. So now her idiot father drops everything (including work) the second she needs to be driven somewhere even though we have a decent public transport system (she's too good for the bus) and most places are in walking distance. She can literally be abusing him while they're driving and he will still take her, buy her takeaway (because she tells him we never buy groceries) and pick her up at any hour. Gives her money at the drop of a hat too. Then he comes complaining to us that he's sick of being used.  #8203; Lastly is my beautiful 7 year old grandson. He's right on the edge of the autism spectrum and is a year behind developmentally. He missed over 80 days of school in the last school year due to his mother not caring enough about school to get him there (education department have standing court orders to see if his attendance picks up this year otherwise it's court and big fines, we end up being the ones to get him to school every morning even though they live literally around the corner from the school) AND having Munchausen by proxy behaviours. This kid knows the name of many ambulance drivers because he's been in the thing so many times. He's been taken because of colds, skinned knees and a blocked nose. He had an underdeveloped lung when he was born which has been taken care of and isn't causing ant issues except drainage issues over winter, which he has a nebulizer for but she won't use it because she likes him being a 'sick' child. She actually complains that he's not autistic enough for her to claims a full carers payment. He's 7 and is in regular counselling (talk therapy and behavioural therapy) due to the trauma of all the boyfriend his mother has had. We're fairly sure he's been physically or sexually assaulted but he won't say yet. His counsellor says he displays many PTSD behaviours. He never feels safe in his own house, our house is his safe house. I can guarantee he will be living here full time by the end of 2020, because his mother will NOT be able to handle 2 kids, she can't handle 1. We've got things in place with children's services for us to have him if/when he gets removed, but we're put off fighting it because she's not a bad mother when she's single, she does the best she can and he never goes without. When she's single. Having 2 kids will change that big time, so we know this is the year and we're ok with that. He also gets the 'no rules, boundaries or consequences' from my SO. I'm the firm one who makes him have those things. So many people say I'm too strict on him, and maybe sometimes I am, but he knows it's because I love him and I'm one person he always has respect for.  #8203; I'm 34. this is not the life I thought I'd have. it's hard not to be resentful when my SO won't change anything about our life. It always gets put back on me. I have borderline personality disorder and bipolar, but I'm the fucking stable one.</TEXT>

Up until recently I've never even considered it any kind of trauma, and even then I'm iffy about it. I'm basically invalidating myself I guess.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Today has been a hell of a day. I have a super important doctor appointment in 10 days that I've waited almost 12 months for. My SO spent the money that was put aside for it. Well, I had to use it to fill the gap in the rent that was there due to all her afterpay (take it now,pay for it later) payments came out (most of which i didn't know about). I don't get paid until 2 days after my appointment. She somehow made the fact I was so stressed I was in tears about her. So I dropped her off at work, came home and had a massive vomit inducing panic attack. Once my emotions had turned off I was able to apply for some of my superannuation under financial hardship, so that will cover my appointment. Went to comfort eat. Fridge is hot. Freezer is hot. Everything is squishy. SO is still at work. Wanted to rage, called my mum instead to bring her car fridge over to save the important stuff. She's going to help us buy a new one tomorrow. Saved the stuff I could from the fridge, had a huge cry on my mother's shoulder and we decided to have an out of town us day tomorrow. She went home, I went and had a shower and indulged in some much needed destructive behaviours. But I didn't rage. I found solutions. That to me is a win. Now I've raided my hidden snack drawer and am going to eat until I feel betterish This year has been bullshit already and I want a new one. Edit: picked my SO up from work. Everything was ignored. Didn't get any kind of comment on fixing either issue. Didn't get any kind of question about if I'm ok (spoiler: I'm not). Basically I get more support from random people on Reddit and that's depressing as fuck.</TEXT>

If I could walk tomorrow I would. My head keeps making lists of what I HAVE to take (pets, my car, my game consoles, my nail polish collection, important papers) and reminding myself most things are replaceable. I'm sadly having to do this without her finding out until I'm all set, until I have a place to go. Opening a secret savings account and putting my name on the public housing list tomorrow. I have no idea how to make sure I get the things I need out. Some stuff I'm going to start moving over to my parents house under the guise of my mother needing to borrow it (mainly hobby stuff). I've never ended a relationship with someone I've lived with. So I have no actual idea.</TEXT>

    <DATE>2020-01-29 09:00:47</DATE>
    <TEXT>In 2 months I'm leaving my defacto partner of 8 years. We don't have kids or joint finances, just the lease in both our names. I've read NSW tenancy laws and apparently I can transfer the lease and bond into her name. Does she need to agree or sign anything for that? I'm worried about her screwing me over if they can't afford to keep living in the house. She pays the rent now, I pay other bills. I'm trying to have as much organised before I tell her, because I don't know how it's going to go. What recourse do I have if she won't let me get my stuff? I have an idea of what I'm taking, mostly stuff I've bought myself with my own money. I'm leaving all my furniture except the fridge my mother just bought us that I'm the one paying off. I'm planning to tell her 2 weeks before I go. Chances are she will want me out the second I tell her which is fine, as long as I can get my stuff because some is irreplaceable. What have I forgotten that I need to do legally?</TEXT>

    <TITLE>Update on leaving my SO</TITLE>
    <DATE>2020-02-12 01:23:50</DATE>
    <TEXT>So. It's been a week since my deadline for leaving. I decided the night before to give her a chance to see how prepared I was to leave. So Tuesday last week we sat down and I talked. I got to talk to her and she listened. She didn't get mad at me, or accuse me of being defensive like she has over and over before. I got to voice everything that I needed to. That I felt I had to leave or I'd suicide. That I felt like I was just a car and not a person. That I felt she was showing her kids it was fine to treat me like shit because she never pulled them up on it. That she needed to decide if I was important enough to make a priority. It hit her hard. She never ever thought I'd leave. She saw I had stuff packed, that I had info on the legal stuff and she realised how fucked up everything had been between us. For the first time I was heard. She didn't make promises because I told her I couldn't trust her promises anymore. I told her she had until the end of February to prove to me it could be different. It's early days but it's been a complete change. We're communicating better, we're enjoying spending time together. We're making each other our main priority. She's pulling her brat of a daughter up verbally when she's nasty to me, as it happens not in text messages afterwards. Which her daughter is hating but finally my SO is seeing I'm not the one causing that shit. I'm also no longer expected to keep doing stuff for this person who is abusive to me any chance she gets. She's saying no to her other daughter and grandson more often about staying with us constantly. It was becoming 3-4 times a week because her daughter would manipulate her into saying yes and they're both so high maintenance it would just cause more stress for both of us. I'm being allowed to voice my frustrations and when I'm upset. I'm being told that what I do for her and for her kids is appreciated. She's also actively working on getting her driver's license which has been a major source of frustration for years. She knows I'm also expecting us to start relationship counselling. So basically I'm still prepared to leave at the end of the month if this current change doesn't last, and she's 100% aware of that and determined that it won't come to that. For the first time in months I'm not fighting for this by myself. I don't feel like I'm drowning. I'm not suicidal and haven't self harmed in 7 days. I'm cautiously optimistic but also aware this may not last and I'm prepared for that as well.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>So I use 2 part resin. The discussion always comes up on groups about whether to measure by weight or volume. The logic is to do it by volume because each part is a different weight. I thought if you used scales and used the tare button in between then it would be the same weight for a 1:1 ratio. I have better results going by weight than volume but now I'm wondering who's right.</TEXT>

    <DATE>2020-02-17 06:51:29</DATE>
    <TEXT>Been struggling with chronic illness for at least 12 months. Actually my whole life but the last 12 months it's really escalated. Still no diagnosis. Maybe Crohn's. Maybe fibromyalgia. And I know if it gets called fibromyalgia it will because they don't know. My SO has fibromyalgia and our symptoms are so different. Even the ones we share are so different. And I know stuff like that will be different for everyone but even the text book stuff doesn't fit. But due to symptoms like migraines and chronic fatigue I had to drop my job from 30 hours to 4 hours. Now I can barley manage that. After not being able to work for any of February my boss is replacing me. This is where being a casual sucks so hard. I get it. I hate it. I hate myself. I hate this illness. What else is it going to take from me?</TEXT>

    <DATE>2020-03-08 22:36:44</DATE>
    <TEXT>My cats (3 or 4 years old) were feral (wild I guess) kittens that have tamed into indoor cat lives really well. One has always been skittish when it's come to people coming into the house. They've both always been a little anxious about people coming into the house, because we have a grandson that comes regularly who is prone to chasing until he corners them. It's something he's always reprimanded for and is getting better but he still makes them anxious. A few weekends ago our house got broken into twice in 3 days and since then we're dealing with frequent fights, urination outside the litter box (one has always peed on any wet towels she can find, now she just goes wherever) and they're both extremely clingy and vocal when they can't find us. They hide if they hear someone coming to our front door and can take hours to come out again. I know feliway is considered a go-to for anxious cats, but it's not something I can afford right now ($50+ just for the diffuser part). Can lavender oil help in the meantime? It's basically all I have handy.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>How do you know if a tattoo can be fixed? I spent 6 months saving to get a tattoo by an artist I've been following for a few years. Should have cancelled when he didn't have my design finished until I reminded him the night before. I had asked multiple times before and got told her was working on it. Basically I didn't realise until I was there that he can't draw, only trace. So my roses are great because Google. But the rest isn't great. It was meant to be my reward of 12 months self harm free and now it just makes me sad and I don't like it enough not to cut near it, which was part of the goal. So how do you know if something can be fixed? It's over 12 months old and he did it ok so the ink stayed really well. The stencil wasn't this wonky in the face, and I'm not a wiggler when I sit. http://imgur.com/gallery/aT3WA0E</TEXT>

I know some dead skin is normal, but nobody I know has it like this. It has been this way for years, at least 10. I suspect I have KP, but don't think it's related. Any thing else I can try?

    <TEXT>For over 5 years my identity has been "disability support worker". I had a job I loved SO much. It was the most satisfying job I've ever had. But then I developed a chronic illness that I'm still waiting for a diagnosis on and had to give my job up. I slowly went from 30+ hours a week to 4. 4 hours that I could barely ever get to. After months of my amazing boss being so understanding we came to a mutual agreement that I needed to be replaced. So now who am I? Depression has hit HARD this last week and my poor SO has been copping behaviours we haven't seen in ages, specifically splitting. But my job loss happened in February, why's it only hitting this hard now? I know I currently am being squished by the anxiety the whole world is feeling so that's not helping. Please tell me someone else knows what I mean by that. I'm 100% that I'm feeling every single person in the world anxiety right now. I'm so empty. Don't even want to lose myself in game land. Poor Arthur Morgan is getting neglected big time. My Stardew Valley farm is frozen in time. I spent 2 hours in front of my PC just staring at the desktop because nothing caught my attention. I can't art, I can't craft. Surprisingly I'm still keeping up with my housework! I just... Blah. Everything is beige.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I'm a step grandparent to a 7 year and and newborn, my partner is the mother of my stepdaughter. Stepdaughter has a significant history of moving abusive and drug addicted men into her house that always end up needing removal by police and AVOs put in place. She has at least 5 current AVOs in place. She will move them in within days of meeting them or becoming 'engaged' which is basically what she calls every relationship. Her 7 year old is showing signs of PTSD and is in therapy literally for trying to overcome these relationships he gets dragged through. We've found out she's met a new boyfriend on Facebook. So it's time we start looking into legally what we can do to protect those children. FACS are well aware of the situation, and she's in thin ice with them after the baby daddy went on an ice fueled rampage and threatened them both with a metal pole. I'm assuming a family law specialist is the way to go, but legally what options are there for protecting them?</TEXT>

    <TITLE>Grounding myself when disassociating</TITLE>

    <TEXT>So I have a super volatile relationship with my stepdaughter. She's basically who I was before my diagnosis but far worse. So she causes me so much anxiety. I'm basically at the point that her perfume makes me disassociate. I have asthma-like reactions to perfumes to begin with but because it's me she doesn't give a fuck so "forgets" she can't wear it and come into the main part of the house. 8 years and she forgets. So that adds to anxiety surrounding her. Is she going to make me feel like I'm having an asthma attack? Is she going to start going off her head about some bullshit? 2 days ago she was screaming at me that I hate her because I'm jealous of how smart she is. Because I asked her if maybe she could not abuse her mother while she was at work. (That shit is a whooooole other story) she's 18 by the way. 18 and has no issue with being horrifically abusive, manipulative and entitled. Basically if BPD and NPD had a baby... She will use her own mother's history of sexual abuse as a way to win fights. Usually when I disassociate scent is what grounds me. But what am I meant to do when it's scent that's triggering me?</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Been over 12 months since my GP picked up on the fact I have a chronic illness. Have had the symptoms all my life, thought it was normal. It was only the sudden and unbearable joint pain I mentioned that made her start looking into things. Some things point towards Crohn's, some towards HEDS. My partner has fibro and I'm terrified of it being classed as that. I know if it does she will expect me to handle mine the way she handles hers and I can't. She's working super hard right now because she's an aged care nurse, and I'm currently unemployed because of this illness so I feel like I can't add to her burden about my health. I'm fairly sure she's sick of it anyways. Was meant to have a colonoscopy within 90 days. Yep. Looking at 6-8 months now due to the virus and the backlog it'll create. Can't have anymore painkillers, worried about getting a clot. Just sad and tired today. Sick of feeling like I'm ruining everyone's day by not being sunny and cheerful. Life has been stressful again and that's made me worse, the weather changed to winter suddenly and that's not helping the pain. Don't feel like I can keep dumping this on my BFF either, she's having her own health issues</TEXT>

    <TEXT>TL;DR: have a med shortage, have some BPD reactions, partner is suprised. Due to the Aussie government deciding that you can't get more than a months worth of medication at a time and me using an older script that hasn't got the right dose I've been at half meds for 4 days. Somehow my partner of 8 years forgets that I have BPD. When I'm stable it's like she thinks I'm cured? Finally got some sleep last night. Got woken up at 8.45 by an unexpected visit from the step daughter and her sons (yep, what's Corona? Her youngest isn't even 2 months old yet, plus they went on public transport) so I was annoyed and grumpy. Because they have zero ability or consideration for other people and I got woken up rudely. And yet somehow I'm the one in trouble? Got told I'm always angry. I'm always taking it out on her. She can't understand why I'm so reactive. I don't think I've done anything wrong. I didn't yell, I didn't get angry or rage. I left the house to prevent those things and took our dogs for a walk. So once again I've ruined her day off. All because I wanted to sleep in. I'm in a huge amount of physical pain due to the chronic illness they still haven't worked out. She has seen me typing. She will assume I'm bitching about her to my BFF, even though I know I'm banned from doing that.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I'm having a hell of a time with obsessive anxiety related thoughts. I'm constantly (pretty much every waking hour) having mental conversations to justify why I'm doing something I'm doing (cooking, using the bathroom, sitting on the couch, walking down the stairs). 90% are aimed at my stepdaughter who is the major cause of my anxiety. I can't interact with her in any way without her flipping out and getting seriously abusive. I can't even be in a room she wants to be in. Great times. I currently feel like I don't belong in my house. I just live here. I'm so wound up all the time, constantly fight or flight. Barely sleeping and when I do it's only 1-2 hours before the anxiety wakes me up. So my relationship is suffering as well. There's a lot of resentment there in the first place for how this nasty individual is allowed to treat people in her life, neither of her parents have/will pull her up or give her any kind of consequences. Especially now that she's 18. But now I've got this obsessive thinking happening that I'm sending so much time trying to hide from my partner because I don't want to put anymore shit on her. I do have a psych I see regularly and try to practice DBT (also have BPD) when I'm stressed but the anxiety is winning. Currently on: Valdoxin 25mg Lamictal 300mg Circadin Deralin 20mg Edit: I'm now lying in bed obsessing over this post and telling myself to delete it because nobody cares anyway.</TEXT>

    <DATE>2020-04-23 08:39:16</DATE>
    <TEXT>If you read my post history, I've had 8 years of issues with my youngest stepdaughter. She's abusive to me and her parents (and her boyfriend and friends), she's manipulative. She's not above using her past "trauma" (her past never affects her unless it suits her, and she won't specify to anyone what happened, it changes to suit her needs) as a tool to get her own way, or my partner's history of abuse to the same end. She's got no empathy. No compassion. She genuinely doesn't believe she's doing anything wrong. It's everyone else's fault. Always. We had a 45 minute screaming tantrum with all kinds of abuse accusations because she was asked to wash the two loads of towels she had created by herself. It was over 15 towels in 7 days. I'm not allowed to speak to her, look at her or listen to her. She asked me a question today and then had a fucking meltdown because I answered it. Sadly both her parents get this too. But they both allow it. There's NEVER any repercussions except heated text exchanges which mean nothing. She can abuse either of them and 20 minutes later turn around, ask for something and she will get it (usually a lift somewhere because she can't possible be seen on public transport) She's meant to be leaving in January. How the hell can I keep doing this until then? She's the only one in this house who's getting what they want. I will NOT let her be the reason I self harm. I refuse to give her that power. If your entire group of friends who have known you for over 15 years tell you you're toxic and refuse to have anything to do with you, doesn't that say something? I'm so done with people blaming this on her age. As she's constantly screaming as us, she's an adult. I wouldn't be any kind of surprised if she gets a big fat BPD diagnosis. But everyone I know with BPD is highly emphatic. I love my partner, but how much longer can "she will be gone soon and life will be different" be something I can cling to? I don't know what I expect posting here. But there's nobody I can talk to. Everyone in my life tells me to leave. But of course it's never that easy.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I have an 18 year old stepdaughter who is exactly how I was at 18 before my BPD got diagnosed. She hits every criteria for BPD and that makes it so hard to live with her. The only difference is she doesn't have the empathy or compassion I've come to expect in people with BPD. I'm usually able to just shut up and ignore her crap. But today I just couldn't. I have a major chemical sensitivity to perfumes and aerosols. It's been that way my entire life and she's known about it for the whole 8 years I've been with my partner. She doesn't give a fuck. I once again reminded her about it. She flipped out. Again. Apparently me asking her to not wear so much of it is abusive. She also tells her friends and boyfriend (I feel so sad for him, he's vulnerable and she takes advantage of that) that I verbally abuse her every day. Most days I don't speak to her or look at her because it will trigger her into a rage. And she's too gutless to take it out on me, she takes it out in her mother in the most horrible way. Last time she told my partner that she deserved the sexual and physical abuse she got from her ex. Today I got told I'm faking my chronic illness. I lie constantly. I'm jealous she's so smart and beautiful. Apparently I've spent 8 years trying to get my partner to send her away (wtf?) because I'm so jealous. Then she started sending my partner abusive text messages because she's blocked on my phone and she knows her mother is an easy target who rarely fights back. She can go from rage to happy in a split second. She's had so many life long friends dump her and tell her she's toxic since finishing school last year. She's made and lost so many friends this year and of course none of it is her fault. It is usually because they get sick of her push/pull, taking advantage, playing them off against each other and expecting them to drive her everywhere without paying for fuel (how can a friend expect a friend to pay for fuel?!?) She has no responsibilities. No consequences. Nothing. She refuses to help around the house because she's an adult and doesn't have to. She refuses to clean up her own shit because she knows my partner will do it. She is the reason I nearly walked out this year. I know I'm not perfect. I know I'm reactive. But I'm trying. I just don't know how much more I can take. She's the only person who can drive me to rage. Thankfully it's a rare thing now, but I'm prone to a physical rage and sometimes I do want to hurt her. I haven't and I most likely never will but God do I want to. The way she treats her parents is the most disgusting thing I've ever seen. But they allow it. Her father is constantly copping her shit then comes to us and says "I don't know why she's like this" as he lets her abuse him then still does everything for her any time she asks. For so many years people have told me she will grow out of it. She's growing into it. I hate to diagnose, but if it's not BPD it's definitely a cluster B disorder. She wants to be a fucking psychologist. Her own psychologist is known in the mental health community to be more harmful than helpful. She's currently being investigated due to some client allegations. She encourages my stepdaughter to play the victim. To use it almost proudly. Tells her that her behaviours are perfectly ok because she's had trauma. Fuck I hate the word trauma now. "I can't do that, I'm depressed because of my trauma" every single person on this planet has experienced trauma. This "psych" has encouraged her to make a formal complaint against one of her teachers for being abusive to her in class. The poor woman asked her to stop talking. But it made her feel victimised and triggered her PTSD. This doctor has told her she has PTSD and OCD. Nobody can work out how she's come to that conclusion. Drowning. Dying to burn myself. Not letting her have that power. Sad.</TEXT>

    <TITLE>Just starting to realise how much my mother messed me up</TITLE>
    <DATE>2020-05-29 03:23:35</DATE>
    <TEXT>(there's no flair for: please tell me I'm not alone) My mum was never able to cut the apron strings when it came to me. Growing up my dad worked away (80-90s, no phone contact) for weeks at a time so my brothers and I were all she had. And she clung hard. I never had to learn to self soothe, how to manage my emotions because she was always there to do it for me. She really thrived when I got severe depression. Loved it. Loved having me so dependant on her. I lived with them until I was in my late 20s because she had me so convinced that I couldn't manage on my own. She's never got over the fact I moved in with my SO 7 years ago. My brothers are both on the other side of the country so I'm all she has nearby. In my teens my dad developed something called cerebellum axatia and after a near fatal fall at work had to stop working so he became a very angry man which caused my mother to hang onto me even harder. I was a teen and the main mental health support for my mother, while dealing with my own (then undiagnosed) bipolar and BPD. My doctors are very sure my BPD is caused by my mother with a mix of never knowing if or when my dad was coming home. He nearly died twice that I know of on site at work. Neither time did he tell us, his boss did. So now, I'm in my 30s. My mother is a very unhappy resentful woman. Loathes my father and is very open about telling me about it. Hates that she's a full time carer to someone who's also a very angry person. Today she suggested I run him over so she can have some peace. In a totally casual way. I don't think she's joking anymore. Any time I have any kind of medical procedure she tries to invite herself "to help" me. Had a colonoscopy last week and she spent over a week trying to convince me to leave my partner at home and let her take me instead. By turning it into a 2 night holiday for me and my partner I avoided that. I nearly left my partner earlier this year and had to talk to my mum about it because I would have had to move back in with them. My partner and I are working on our issues and I didn't move out. I now get regular guilt trips from my mother about how much she was looking forward to me moving "home". Like she's hurt that I feel my relationship is worth trying to save. I get that she wants to spend more time with me, I do. But it just causes me so much anxiety and sadness. My partner is resentful of her because of all this shit so that makes it hard too. I have enough shit causing major anxiety in my life without her adding her shit on top. She refuses to get any kind of help for her mental health. I can't explain to her that it's seriously affecting me when she does this stuff. So I try to avoid seeing her. Which makes me feel guilty. Some days I'm convinced I'm the bitch daughter from hell as they used to call me. I'm ungrateful for the years she supported my mental health because I can't support hers. I'm so exhausted. I'm basically a 5 year old in a grown ups body</TEXT>

    <TEXT>My partner and I are having the same fight as usual. She's the martyr as usual, I'm the over critical too emotional, defensive one who will never listen to what she says. today she tells me I need to control my emotions because she can. I remind her yet again I have something in my fucking brain that makes it so much harder to regulate my emotions and I do a fucking good job at it now. She tells me she does too. She has depression which means she struggles to regulate her emotions so she knows how hard it is. I'm sorry but what the actual fuck. I'm literally here trying to tell her that she needs to admit fault for once and she's telling me that she's got emotional regulation issues? She has issues showing emotions. Of not ignoring them. Not with the fact they completely control her life and brain and body. She's not an emotional fucking time bomb. But hey, she totally knows how I feel. I rarely tell her how I'm feeling. I rarely tell anyone. Because if I try to tell her the second I get some kind of emotion in my voice I get accused of being defensive. Which fucking makes me fucking defensive. So that proves her right and I just shut the fuck up and SH instead. Edit: now I'm getting "I'm not going to talk to you while you're being irrational"</TEXT>

    <DATE>2020-07-22 12:05:58</DATE>
    <TEXT>So I've been having a bad BPD style relapse over the last month or so. But now that I'm more of a quiet borderline girl it's a slow spiral into hell. So I went and saw my GP last week (yay me, waited until crisis point) and she stuck my back on Seroquel for a month just to stop my head racing all the damn time. Seriously, my anxiety was so out of control that my brain was almost turning itself off. I was convinced I was losing my mind because I just became so fucking dumb. Losing words, getting lost, forgetting things the second I heard them. I voiced the fact that after being off Seroquel for 3 years it felt like I was failing by going back on them. She made me stop and listen. She said that it's no different to someone with asthma who's had it under control for years. Sometimes there will be some trigger that nobody can predict or see coming, so they add in extra help (medication) until it's passed and then go back to their usual routine. She heard me, validated me and reassured me. I went back yesterday for a follow up (I'm 100 times better than I was, love Seroquel) and we got to talking about the nature of BPD. I'm her most managed borderline patient so she can often get a different perspective from me. I told her my theory that we don't necessarily grow out of the BPD traits and behaviours, that I think we just learn to turn them inwards instead. I know I'd rather take it out on myself than others like I used to. I told her that even with all the therapy my thinking patterns are the same, I just have that filter between thoughts and actions that usually works really well. I also told her how I've learnt the biggest reason behind BPD behaviours is control. Lack of, needing. I've always been at my worst when my emotions (and therefore my life) were out of control. So I'd do ANYTHING to feel like I had some kind of control. So, manipulation, SH, disordered eating, risky behaviours, impulsive behaviours. All of it, for me, was about control. That obsessive need for control. She took notes. She's going to talk to her colleagues about it and see if they've had other patients voice the same kind of thing. And I know she's not patronising me. She heard me. She validated my point of view. She thanked me for adding my insight and changing how she looks at BPD recovery. Yes she's only a GP, but she specialises in mental health and is always learning about things like BPD because they're so misunderstood. Some doctors are just amazing and make up for the years and years of shitty horrible ones.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I'm so starving for attention in my relationship that my emotional mind is telling me all the things I should be trying to get it. I have a box full of my medications that would get some attention if I gave in to my urges. I've been struggling with an undiagnosed chronic illness for 12 months. I had to give up my much loved job because of it, the thing that gave me my own identity. I feel like the person I was has died. And all my partner of 8 years can do is remind me the reasons why she resents me right now. Of all the reasons I'm the issue in our relationship. Of how frustrated she is that I'm not working. I get a disability allowance, I have for 15 years so I am contributing financially to this family. But it's not enough. Today I find out that I'm not "sick enough" for the specialist to want to see me until February. I'm fucking devastated. Told my partner. No reply. Nothing. No discussion. No sympathy. Nothing. So I'm all sliced up again. Was clean for 2 weeks. Fighting so hard not to do those things I want to do to get attention. From someone. Anyone. Back to my GP on Tuesday. She's insisting on seeing me fortnightly right now, after my meltdown 2 weeks ago over much the same thing. Why am I 15 emotionally again? I'm 34 for fuck sake. At least it's bedtime and I can take my Seroquel and pass out for a few hours</TEXT>

Happens every time she's told no, or needs something from someone. Never mentions it any other time. Refuses to disclose it. Refuses to do anything about it.</TEXT>

Edit edit: anything it can find says it's unrecoverable Edit: yes I know about backups, the day I was due to back up was the day my computer died My PC died a few weeks ago and the new one I bought has a SSD. I've been trying to transfer my files from my old HDD to the new one and my local computer company wants at least $100AU for that. I bought a USB to SATA unit, but the software included with it only seems to let me use it as a backup drive. And I can't get the software to recognise the HDD. Is there better software? Can I even do it with this unit? I bought it after seeing on Google that it's what I could use. The unit connects fine and the HDD starts running Please help me, I'm desperate and can't afford the $100 after buying a new computer. I need my uni assignments!

    <TITLE>How to stop constant false allegations?</TITLE>
    <DATE>2020-08-21 00:13:33</DATE>
    <TEXT>My stepdaughter made a huge mistake dating some druggie. They've been broken up for almost 12 months but now his new girlfriend is causing an incredible amount of shit. They both seem to believe my 6 month old grandson is his and are openly (they've admitted it to the police) making false allegations to the police and FACS. She's been accused of prostituting her kids, of keying this guy's car. Of driving past their house hurling abuse. Of abusing and threatening them at the doctor. Of using drugs in front of the kids. Of so much shit. All of which has been proven false every time. There's AVOs in place both ways but that doesn't cover this, which I knew it wouldn't. These people keep getting their friends in as witnesses and so far it's gone to court once. And has ended with her getting a 2 year good behaviour bond even though they were able to prove she didn't do it. I have a feeling she got mouthy in court. Is there any steps that can be taken to stop this happening? We have a terrified 7 year old grandson in the middle of this.</TEXT>

    <TITLE>Afternoon mood crash</TITLE>
    <DATE>2020-08-21 06:24:43</DATE>
    <TEXT>I've been doing a lot better mood wise lately, especially if I'm out of the house. My house is one of the biggest causes of anxiety for me, but I'm currently unable to change my living circumstances. Or remove the person who creates the anxiety. Once I get home from being out and about all day, just driving up the driveway can crash my mood. Which then makes my partner annoyed/angry (I feel like she's angry, she claims she isn't, but she starts talking in short sentences or monosyllables) which makes me frustrated and upset. I was helping her bring wood in, nearly tripped over the rug and would have fallen on the fireplace. She took offense to how I said "I'm about to fall on the fireplace" and now she's barely speaking to me. Which triggers a lot of my abandonment issues, which she knows. Then apparently I was unloading the dishwasher aggressively. Afternoons have always been hard, especially if I've been in an ok/good mood all day because I'm exhausted by the end of the day. So my mood will crash even without the added stress of coming home. I wish I knew how to stop it. How to make my partner see that it's not something I'm choosing, that it's one of the few emotional responses I can't control. Edit: going to sit and play cities: skylines for awhile and watch my trams</TEXT>

    <DATE>2020-08-30 03:57:47</DATE>
    <TEXT>I got a massive ear infection in March/April. Took 2 rounds of antibiotics and a slight perforation before it healed. I lost hearing in the one ear for weeks. Now I'm left with the fun wooshy tinnitus (diagnosed by my doctor, I know it's the blood but it's worse than that). Most days there's a kind of pressure that goes along with it and days like today it brings on nausea, dizziness and headaches. The only thing that kind of helps is pressing on the ear (kind of pushing my tragus into my ear) until the feeling stops, but that could literally just be a placebo thing. I am so fed up. And nobody gets it. "Oh, I hear the blood in my ear too", yeah but do you feel it wooshing through? Does it make you feel seasick? So close to tears from it today.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Rage had always been my biggest and first emotional response. Pure blackout rage. I've been known to physically lash out (gave a kid a black eye in grade 2) at others or myself. Sadly it's taken years and years of DBT and mindfulness therapy along with just maturing in general to be able to control it. The only medication I ever found that helps the rage (I have bipolar as well so medication is essential anyway) is Seroquel, so I assume a lot of my anger is anxiety related because Seroquel helps my anxiety so much.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>My dad has cerebellum ataxia which apparently isn't common? Took him 20 years to get it diagnosed after all the usual things like motor neuron got ruled out (by the "oh you're not dead yet" method) Our local neurologist got him involved with our local university which is a med school as a final year exam case study. In the 4 years he did it only 1 student got close to diagnosing him. The others were always so interested in his case and often followed up with the neurologist to see how the case was progressing. Basically none of his other doctors had ever cared the way those students did. They saw how this affected all aspects of his life, how it decimated his mental health where most doctors still don't care to know that stuff</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I can't work full-time time. Keeping myself stable is such a big job in itself that working full time (or part time in some jobs) means I have to choose between doing my job well or keeping myself well. I'm very lucky I have a disability support pension and my partner works basically full time. I may have once had a rage fit and thrown a cast iron stapler at a fellow co-worker once. Luckily he was known for being antagonistic and my boss just said not to do it again.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I've just been on a much needed week away (following covid restrictions) with my partner. It was amazing. We reconnected, I was relaxed for the first time in months. Driving home yesterday I made sure to remind her that my mood would crash over the next few days. God, normal people have a mood crash after a good vacation. I thought she understood. It's now 9.30pm. she's literally angry at me because "you've changed since we got back" I did my best. I tried to stay out of everybody's way today. I kept to myself and just shut up. But I guess that was wrong to? This is what she messaged me: Its the way you huffed and puffed about the house all day. You complained about lots of little insignificant things. I reminded her that we had discussed it. She told me that she didn't think it would be this extreme? What the fuck? Me asking her to remind her daughter to clean up her shit in the kitchen is extreme? I don't shout. I don't yell. I don't swear at anybody. I don't raise my voice. She's never going to be happy with me or what I do. Now I feel like I've totally fucked everything up and I deserve to hurt like I've obviously hurt everyone and now I just want to carve all the skin off my legs</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Thanks for your reply, I did manage to keep myself safe and calm myself down. It's so infuriating for me because I did exactly what we've agreed on. Staying out of the way is what she's always agreed was best in the situations because she says I ruin everybody's day (I ruin everything for everyone all the time apparently) if I talk to people. I wasn't angry. I wasn't yelling. I wasn't taking anything out on anybody because there wasn't anything to take out on anybody? I was tired and sad and that was it. But people love that I have these disorders they can use to make me responsible for their shit. If my mood is affected by the moods of those around me I'm the one who gets blamed for affecting the mood in the house. I'm not being spoken to today. Which will of course be my fault too. I don't know why she hates me so much TBH.</TEXT>

You're currently in a dip in the road and you're dealing with it the best you can. If that's self harming for right now, well, it is what it is. Not a failure in any way. I'm saying that you do need to tell him you're struggling. It will take some of the pressure off of you which might help the self harm urges. He's going to be more sad and disappointed you haven't come to him for that support than they face you have self harmed. Also, my BFF is over 1000km away, and is an amazing support for me! So I'm sure you and your BF will find something that works!</TEXT>

I refuse to even go there. This year has been so shit. Then once you start adding everything else on top of that it is like drowning. Is there any way to talk to HR or someone at your work to see if you can work something out? Reduced hours even? If it's financially possible of course which I know for a lot of people isn't. You've got so much to deal with it's no wonder you're struggling as hard as you are. I wish I had better words for you, but all I have is that you're not alone. At all.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I'm going to guess the drunk kissing was sloppy and full on. So really it wouldn't be a surprise if he tried to make that move on her, it may have been that all the signs were pointing that way. If you're frenching some guy at a party chances are they're going to assume it's leading to sex, so it was up to her to say she didn't want to. Which I know is hard but it's easier than potentially fucking up some guys life over a drunken kiss To me it seems like a "oh fuck I can't believe I did that" moment that she's trying to explain away to make it seem like she's "not that type of girl".</TEXT>

    <TEXT>The good news is it is possible to live with BPD managed! The bad news is it takes hard (fucking hard) work and time (so much time), but it's worth it to have stable relationships. Are you in DBT? That's the gold standard therapy for BPD, but it's hard to access in a lot of places. Working through DBT skills is the best way to get these behaviours under control. The other good need is a lot of the extreme behaviours can be "grown out" of in some ways. As people with BPD our emotional control matures far slower than we're maturing biologically, so as your emotionally mature it gets easier to rationalize what's happening.</TEXT>

Having BPD isn't your fault, you didn't ask for it. Remember that relapses do not undo all the progress. Because it shows there's been progress.</TEXT>

Even as a teen I loathed how much "fun" people found it to share their graphic SH photos (lol, back in the 00s) on their LiveJournal blogs. At that age they just don't get it. They don't get how much it will affect your life forever. They don't get how dangerous it is. How hard it is to stop when you've been doing it for 20 years because you didn't want to been considered that kind of self harmer so you just didn't tell anyone so you never got help. It's all a game. A fucking dangerous game. It's right up there with the proED behaviours.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>My parents never made a boyfriend sleep in a separate bed/room when he stayed at ours. I've always had male friends (and did scouts with a troop that had a co-ed tent situation) sleep over and we've always shared a bed. So when I started having boyfriends sleep over at 15 or so it seemed stupid to tell me I couldn't share a bed with them? My mother figures teens are going to fuck, at least I'd fuck at home where it's safe. I didn't lose my virginity until I was almost 17 and that was with sleepovers most weekends. So parents are more realistic about sex and their kids. You guys are adults and in a relationship so it's kind of expected you will be having sex. At least this way you're not having to sneak around to do it.</TEXT>

I can go and do groceries at my local food pantry without an issue because I know one bag is always $15 regardless of how much you cram in there. Anywhere else?

Then it became a place to share anyone who dares to make any kind of suggestion about improving your situation.

    <TEXT>No? He dated 1 14 year old? He's now in a relationship with a girl his age. He's only ever dated within 1-2 years of his age, this was the only time he's done anything like this. And no, it's not because he's so good at keeping secrets. He's far too up himself not to tell us about every girl, in detail. He not blameless in any way. Neither is the girl. It was a shitty situation. The only reason I shared it was to show that sometimes parents are more than happy for their kids to be in inappropriate relationships.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>So planning dinner for tonight. I have chicken drumsticks marinated, broccoli and cauliflower I need to use. So duh, cheesy broccoli cauliflower bake. Then trying to work out whether to do rice, pasta or potatoes. My partner keeps telling me I don't need to do any of those. My head keeps saying it's not a meal without that kind of starch? Growing up every meal had at least one of those 3 things. So it feels incomplete to not use one? I suggested a potato/broccoli bake but that got vetoed, we've had pasta a few nights in a row and a bunch of rice. So I guess my question is, is it ok to not have that starch?</TEXT>

She got fed up of being harassed and bullied by dogs with owners who think screaming "he's friendly" is enough to have your dog under control.

She was a super social dog before all this, and it was a super hard adjustment for both of us when she changed. Luckily we have so many places out of town we can take our girls (we have 2 older ones and an idiot) that's guaranteed to be dog free and means they can go swimming and eat dead things to their hearts content! I did the "mines not!" thing, but then started being rd that fighting is what dogs are meant to do, and that it's totally fine. So we stopped going to dog places.</TEXT>

That morning as she's starting lunch (we do Christmas lunch) she decides, as a non drinker, to let her 18 year old, who's a junior alcoholic, make her a drink. An hour later she's passed out on the bathroom floor after being so drunk she tried to take shit out of the oven without oven mitts.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I'm on my 3rd Mirena and I'm not finding this one as effective at controlling my period as the last 2. With the last 2 I had maybe 1 period in 12 months; and it was super light, basically just spotting, with no pain. On my 3rd one which is almost 12 months old I've had regular (every 2-3 months) painful periods. My period is basically what it is without any kind of contraception. Hours of horrific pain and very heavy bleeding. The only reason for me using the IUD is period control, as other method cause my bipolar/BPD to be harder to stabilize. Haven't been back to to doctor about it yet, but will be soon.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I'm in the process of changing my mood stabilizers, so obviously my moods are going to be out of whack. Right? that's expected isn't it? A girl with BPD and Bipolar without the right level of mood stabilizer is good to be kind of emotional. Except that my head is clearer than it has been in months. But somehow my partner has decided I'm a horribly out of control wreck. She hates being with me. I'm constantly lashing out and irrational. Because I insisted she said something that she claims she didn't. It happens all the time. She thinks she said something and hasn't, or has said something and doesn't remember. But it's always me who's remembering wrong. But because I'm not backing down and admitting that I'm wrong I'm currently being accused of going off my head. I'm not yelling. I'm not swearing. I'm actually very calm. Well I was until the personal attacks started. Now all I want to do is burn all my skin off. Went and sat in the bathroom with my blade for 15 minutes and didn't cut. Because I know if I do it'll just be another way I'm manipulative and making myself the victim. This whole thing is trash. I'm trash.</TEXT>

Oh, they don't know yet because they're travelling 4 hours back from my dad's cancer scans. So surprise I guess? I brought as much stuff with me as I could by myself.

    <TEXT>My recently ex partner hated that I'm as close to my best friend as I am. Even though she lives on the other side of the country so we never see each other and they've never met she couldn't ever get over the jealousy over that friendship. But I'm not dropping someone who's been in my life for 20 (omg) years just because my partner has taken some kind of dislike to her. I shared just as much (and more) with my partner but there's always been so much she just doesn't understand about me that my best friend does.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Stayed at my mother's house recently and she has one. At 4am it decided it was cleaning time. Then got bogged on a mat and kept sending my mother messages telling her it was stuck on a cliff. Stupidest thing ever.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Bleach will always damage the hair it's used on. If done carefully it can minimise the damage but there will be damage as you're literally stripping the hair and removing the proteins. Edit: there will be people who say their hair hasn't been damaged by bleach, but it's a damaging process. Sometimes the damage just isn't very visible.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I find sexting with women far more satisfying than with men, I'm guessing because women tend to be able to voice things in more than a "stick my dick in u" way.</TEXT>
