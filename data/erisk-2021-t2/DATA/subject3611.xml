    <TEXT>I've played since 1997, I was 16, and I have never broken 100 "legitimately". First 4-5 years I had old mixed set of irons and a bent wood driver. Next few years I had better clubs but spent more time drinking than taking the game seriously. Next 3 years I took the game very seriously but never took lessons so even the 60+ rounds a summer (I got free staff golf) wasn't going to do much if all was focused on was keeping my head down and my arm straight. For the next 9-10 years I had to sell my sweet sticks due to tough financial times and thus played maybe once a year with a 22 year old set of burners. Finally back into the game, got a sweeet new set but more importantly I'm reading a lot about the game, (Harvey Pennicks Little Red Book, so key) have lessons booked for next week and I also got a Zepp golf, I highly recommend as it can give you a lot of information about your swing, and don't want to jinx my first round but crushing them at the range like I never have before. TLDR; played for over 20 years and never broken 100.</TEXT>

    <TITLE>Should I buy one?</TITLE>
    <DATE>2017-04-28 01:33:38</DATE>
    <TEXT>So my Kia Sportage was written off Monday and I will soon be looking to buy new wheels. I didn't mind the Kia so getting another one is an option but I have loved the Renegade since I first saw them last year. So far this is purely aesthetic as I have not taken a test drive yet. My friend who does a lot of good research before buying anything tells me these and FCA in general are no good. Few guys at work that are fairly knowledgeable enthusiasts tell me these are junk. My father is a mechanic with 40 years experience and he says he would never buy anything Dodge, Jeep or Chrysler in a million years. So I ask you guys who own one, especially anyone who's had the vehicle for a year or two, are they wrong? After 20 years of driving and half a dozen cars I'm starting to think for the most part a car is car is car. Are these reliable? I've heard the 9 speed auto is terribly laggy, is this true? How is the wheel and wind noise on the freeway? My Kia got at least 500 km to a 60 litre tank how do the Renegades compare? I bought the Kia purely based on stellar reviews etc., and while it was decent there were things a didn't like. I want to get into another smaller size SUV but other than the Renegade and maybe the Cherokee I don't really like the look of most of the other stuff out there, and if I do like them they're usually out of my price range. Thank you in advance for any help guys hope to be posting my purchase here soon.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I just checked mine based on this years scores and it says I'm at 13.6 but before you tell me to F off I've spent close to $4000 CAD on equipment, books, lessons etc., so if you guys haven't done that then even better off in my book. Also just as an offer of help if welcomed, my first round was 130 and through 8 rounds I've gone down at least one stroke or more to my last round of 92, biggest factor in my mind is putting practice on a cheap Hank Haney mat just about every night for 2 hours or more. I'm putting 2 or less about 95% of the time. I'm just gonna run barefoot in the dark into my kids playroom now ;)</TEXT>

    <TEXT>He just went almost 2 years without being punched in the face, at least professionally, maybe if he had learned before that he wouldn't have been so fucked with his taxes. Anyways side argument to add, forget money and estates etc altogether, something as simple as mixed medications that could lead to accidental death can easily be avoided simply by being able to read. I will stand by this particular argument until the day I die, if you don't learn to read you are a fucking idiot. I would also like to clarify 100%, I completely understand that there are individuals on this earth that are perpetually denied or in some way unable to learn to read. When I say fucking idiots I am referring to anyone who has logistical access to the required education and simply does not for most if not any reason. In his case he has massive amounts of money and a profession that does not require constant attendance, with even half a million dollars and maybe 2-3 weeks I'm sure he could at least reach an 8th grade level. Fortunately for him he has a lot more money and a lot more free time.</TEXT>

It frustrates me personally, I work in construction and meet a few people every few months or so that are in their 40s 50s 60s that can't read yet will completely tear into some new guy that maybe can't run a jackhammer on his first try. Most of these guys make 100k+ a year and many only work 9-10 months out of the year. They have plenty of time to snowmobile and fish but can read the danger and warning signs.</TEXT>

As another comment mentioned earlier, using the internet would even be difficult if not impossible without the ability to read. So I stand by my judgment of him being an idiot as all of that struggle you mentioned, as formative and influential as it may be, he is a grown man now capable of making his own decisions and if he is deciding against bettering himself in such a basic way then he's an idiot in my opinion.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Got blackout drunk at a ball game in my twenties. Woke up the next having spent my last $100 on a black collectors Louisville slugger. Apparently on the way home from the game We stopped at the beach to smoke weed and used it to hit rocks into the Lake, luckily just a few minor dings from that asshattery. I was also missing my cellphone and had vomited all over my friends washroom. Ended up selling the bat on eBay a few years later for around the price I paid.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Total head game. I practice and follow the fundamentals and start hitting it great, straight and far and it feels so good. Then human nature kicks in and you think  #8220;I can get more, maybe another 5, 10 or 15 yards #8221; and before you know it you #8217;re chunking or hozzling shots trying to kill the ball.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I would avoid WGT subscription personally, it loses connection a lot and misses far more shots than the SkyTrak range software. Too frustrating to use for me and for the $150 I regret it. TGC is definitely cool but personally I can #8217;t justify that much money for a game that costs less than $50 on other platforms especially considering how much the SkyTrak already set me back. SIM golf is fun but ultimately I got the LM for practice so I can do without.</TEXT>

It #8217;s not as bad as Genipher maybe but why do it in the first place, to distinguish him from other Jadens? I just think it #8217;s a needless alteration to an already established name. It isn #8217;t the end of the world but as someone named Jeremy who still has to spell out his name to most people I am just glad my folks weren #8217;t douchebags and named me Jairumy.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Ugh millions of people have kids when their financial situation doesn #8217;t even come close to meeting the requirements, some of the poorest people in the poorest places have the most, like 4+ kids usually due to reasons of religion, lack of education or no access to alternative family planning practices. Millions more pop out half a dozen despite living in the shittiest most dangerous places on earth with no positive outlook. There are tons of people who don #8217;t even want kids but have them anyway for various bad reasons. The fact that family #8217;s like the Duggars and Jon amp;Kate+8 are a successful form of entertainment just tells me the majority of people don #8217;t take the idea of having and raising kids seriously. I #8217;m not going to go through all of the reasons it would take all day but in my opinion the majority of our species can barely handle operating automobiles and being a good parent is much harder than driving.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Lmao I, sir, did at no point wish sterilization upon anyone, nor did I suggest that there should be any rules or laws put in place to do so. I believe in total free will. I personally believe this is a problem with no solution. If I were ever going to wish anything regarding this matter it would be that people around the world simply make better choices based on common sense and logic instead of emotions and religious views or what people would think about them. The tv programme is not the evidence but the millions upon millions who clearly find those shitshows entertaining instead of disturbing as they likely should. As for me myself, I am 37 and grew up comfortably enough but to be fair in many ways I still act like a 17 year old. I am also a father. If you need to confirm any of this there are a few posts in my history that should enlighten you. I also include myself in this, I am someone who probably should not have had children. I am a selfish person with both my time and my resources. She got pregnant and like all men should do, I told her that it was 100% her choice and I would support her in any way that I am needed. Up until the day my son was born I never wanted to be a father. Despite growing up in relative comfort I am somewhat cynical and didn #8217;t want to bring a child into this shitty, hostile overpopulated dumpster fire of a society, and I am self aware enough to know that #8217;s a bit of an excuse to hide the truth that I didn #8217;t want a child in my life at the time. The choice was made however and since the moment my son entered this world I wouldn #8217;t change it for anything. I do the best I can despite my flaws but I know there are less like me and more like the type that would do much less if anything at all.</TEXT>

I never said that strictly poor people shouldn #8217;t have kids or are the bad parents nor did I say anything close to the idea of them bringing down society. Again the people I have mentioned in this are all people, rich, poor whatever. Also reading philosophy, history and literature is a great thing to do but if you can #8217;t argue or debate without quoting someone every few lines how do you even tell if you have original thoughts or opinions of your own anymore? People you quote may have had noble ideas but noble ideas don #8217;t always play out so well in real life.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Cops are generally lazy and unhelpful when I have called them. 6 years ago on a rainy night I watched a guy in a pickup lose control doing twice the speed limit on my residential street, he did a complete 360 off the road onto someone #8217;s lawn and took out a real estate sign then drove off. I followed them as I spoke to the police and once they pulled into a driveway of a house the lady on the phone told me that there isn #8217;t anything they can do now that the person appears to be home. Keep in mind this could have very well been an impaired driver. When I sarcastically suggested that I could rob a bank and as long as I get to my driveway I #8217;m Home free she got snarky and said she would send an officer out to my neighbourhood to investigate. She told me the officer would need to talk to me, at this point it #8217;s past 11pm and I have a new baby sleeping in the house, asked if the officer could call my cell phone instead of knocking, I was told they don #8217;t have cell phones lol in 2012. So I waited outside in the cold for almost an hour when a cruiser finally showed up parked 3 doors down from the accident scene, shined their spotlight on the house the were in front of (3 doors down from the actually accident scene lol) then after a few minutes I started to approach them to talk and they drove away. Completely useless lol.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I #8217;m not even going to look that up because even if it #8217;s true and I, for the sake of argument agree with your apparent belief that driving as slow as you like on a busy street in rush hour doesn #8217;t make you a huge inconsiderate jerk, the problem that you then fail to see which was more the issue to me than the speed (I #8217;m honestly not at all a ragey driver and I was in no hurry really) was the likely heavy cabinet half hanging from her trunk, unsecured that could fall out into moving traffic at any moment hence her slow pace. Still don #8217;t see a problem then don #8217;t know what to tell ya fella.</TEXT>

Make assumptions about my character all you want this kind of shit is unsafe, dipshit stupid and unnecessary. Edit: judging by the comments and downvotes I think I figured out what #8217;s going on here. This is a subreddit for normal people to laugh at and judge idiots in cars driving poorly and/or unsafely, I think maybe some of you got a little confused and think it #8217;s like a forum or group for idiots in cars to discuss things  #128514;</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Surprisingly there are no official regulations in Ontario, I didn #8217;t bother checking other places. A google search will show a pretty decent consensus that their use in situations like this is controversial and from what i saw in some forums quickly was its mostly frowned upon. I wasn #8217;t really inconvenienced much, I posted about it on the internet, Reddit specifically, a subreddit about idiots in cars, which even if you #8217;re correct and 4 way flashers can be used pretty much whenever you feel like it is totally no prob bro  #9996; #65039;the cabinet teetering in and out of her trunk should qualify her being posted here. I #8217;m not justifying anything, even though I wasn #8217;t upset by her behaviour the dozens of people honking at her behind me and while passing her further down the road is all the justification I would need if I needed any. The only thing I kind of regret a little is that I can #8217;t jump on you for resorting to name calling because I #8217;d be a hypocrite after earlier alluding to you guys as the subject of this subreddit. Also I like how you refer to the couple dozen people on this thread as the internet  #128518;</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I work at a CANDU station in Ontario and one of the biggest, most watched and drilled safety rules we have is anything with wheels (tool boxes, compressors, push carts etc) has to be tethered with a steel cable to something structural. According to experts at our site had things been tethered and prevented from rolling all over during a seismic event (namely the backup cooling generators) Fukushima would not have been nearly as bad. Not always necessarily design flaws, just not eliminating all possible hazards. I #8217;m not sure what it #8217;s like in the rest of the world but there is just about zero possibility of a disastrous event at a Canadian nuclear facility. The amount of safeguards and procedures in place just don #8217;t allow it, trade of is you get a couple hours worth of work done in a full day lol.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I have one, the Zepp 2 I believe. My intention is not to burst any bubbles, mine could be defective, but when I have used it in conjunction with my SkyTrak, a couple other high end simulators and a trackman that was at a course I visited it was not consistent at all with the data from the other devices and they were all pretty close to each other. Like my average driver club speed with Zepp is like 110 and with all the sims it #8217;s more like 90. Anyway it still seemed good for plane and stuff like that just kind of humbled me once I compared the data.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Maybe except the skytrak matched up much closer to Trackman and other presumably accurate simulators. It is possible skytrak #8217;s calculated reading is just more reliable than the Zepp. Again my Zepp could just be a lemon. The Zepp reading has to a calculated one too based on hand speed as the Zepp unit is attached to the hands and not the club.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>This. The prequels were dogshit and despite the original 3 the sequels have further tarnished the franchise forever in my opinion. As for Harry Potter I feel like anyone born before 1990 isn #8217;t all that into it. Whereas Marvels been making fans since the 60 #8217;s and the bonus fact that they #8217;re really entertaining accessible movies on their own just adds an even bigger fanbase and to wrap it all up they #8217;ve been able to connect it all with so much chemistry, ya sorry but personally I agree with OP this is unlikely to ever be replicated.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>That #8217;s kind of a stupid way to look at it. Nobody is saying the Germans are bad. That #8217;s like saying as an American I hate when people talk about how bad the KKK is. You aren #8217;t a Nazi so why should it bother you. Also as others have stated below it #8217;s not a competition. Pretty much anyone that kills even one person out of arbitrary hate or for money or for any other reason other than in self defence or protecting others is equally a piece of shit in my books. The fact that some of them hit numbers in the thousands and millions doesn #8217;t necessarily make them worse, they just maybe didn #8217;t have anyone to stop them as quickly. My girlfriend in high school was an exchange student in Germany in the 90 #8217;s and from what her and Yuri her exchange counterpart tell me most Germans hate the Nazi history and that there is a deep national regret about it.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>You can make a case that it #8217;s unrealistic and depending on the movie can pul the viewer out of the moment but I highly doubt there has been a history of bad drivers and collisions based on this. I could be wrong and I don #8217;t feeling like looking bro any further but it just seems silly to me to think that people would be inattentive drivers because they watched movies with people driving.

    <TEXT>Also LOTR was great I #8217;ve been a huge fan since I read the books as a kid, but I don #8217;t feel like the movies are at all like the MCU. Definitely not stand alone movies unless you #8217;ve already seen or read. They were filmed simultaneously so not really replicating what Marvel has done keeping the cast members on board for over 10 years across over 20 films. No really crossover element involved either unless you count Gandalf and a few others in the Hobbit movies. Great epic films but still not on the scale of the MCU, imho.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Totally agree on that what I think we meant but it was a while ago, was the combination of epic scale, accessibility, timeline of production and most importantly the crossover aspect of characters/actors with very little recasting along the way but the more I write about this the more I #8217;m seeing how pointless it all kind of is being such a vague and broad topic of comparison  #128514;</TEXT>

    <TEXT>That #8217;s what I figured for the sentiment, fair enough. I wanted to play the uncharted series a few years back, before the collection came out, I asked around on Facebook, ended up getting 6 offers from friends, none of them wanted a dime, I got a nice fat body off a friend and was tempted to take the rest of them up on their offers and make a big trade in at EB but my conscience got the best of me. If you have social media though try a shout out first people can be very generous.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>This seems just stupid and obvious to me. YouTube is a video application/site, this they should be known for video content. Wanna watch a music video? YouTube. Want to just listen to music? Sotify, radio, satellite, Apple etc. Too many of these companies are trying too hard and spending too much money trying to be everything. Some with success but most not. Netflix is awesome, Disney plus, if you want their content or franchises also awesome. prime is a must for me because of The Expanse and I #8217;m sure they have other decent content but they are doing something Apple is also doing with their new service, if I am paying x amount of dollars for your service I want to open your app and see everything available with the service I am paying for. I do not for fucks sakes want to find a movie or show I #8217;m looking for and when I click to watch am asked to subscribe to x service on top of the original service I am paying for, that immediately causes me to cancel my trial or membership and will proceed to pirate said content. Apple you are a hardware and software company, you #8217;ve now spent millions on the Morning Show, and as ok as it was I will not be keeping your service past the trial date. Studios! License your content to Netflix etc, if you all keep trying to run your own streaming services with their own monthly fees we #8217;ll all eventually get fed up like we did with cable, say fuck it, and pirate your shit.</TEXT>

Jose Bautista was killing it for years after 2010 and even when they finally made the cover of The Show that year they decide to do a separate US and Canada cover, like despite 52 homers etc. Anyway as much as I get US teams/players draw more money I just feel there are certain times where it goes to far so to speak. Again just my opinion, I #8217;m not furious over it and I #8217;ll likely forget it by the morning. No big deal.</TEXT>

If Harden or Giannis jerseys sell the most I get that they stock more of them, but there were zero Toronto jerseys, a couple tshirts. Maybe they were sold out maybe not, I have a bunch so I wasn #8217;t bummed out not being able to buy one just thought it would have been nice to see more it #8217;s a big store, and mainly I just don #8217;t think it would hurt their Harden sales to have both finalists in the front of the store.

While a security guard was watching over it waiting for police to arrive a guy with a machete and a tshirt wrapped around his face ran up grabbed it and took off in a pickup truck. Small island though and witnesses recognized the special edition truck and the guy was arrested shortly after. Maybe it #8217;s a regular occurrence lol.

So what you #8217;re basically asserting is that you don #8217;t approve of Trump based on what he says or does but rather to spite people who you dislike despite not actually knowing them. Not only that but if you in fact do realize he #8217;s a rambling idiot then you #8217;re basically voting for someone who could do harm to your country and therefore do harm to yourself and your family, again just to spite someone like myself who incidentally does not live in the US and therefore is largely unaffected by the outcome anyway. You #8217;re basically saying  #8216;I don #8217;t like the bad thing cause I #8217;m an idiot, I #8217;m just pretending to be an idiot to piss off smart people #8217;.

I say you #8217;re immature because of the comment you made about boomers dying off for cheap housing. Reddit is mostly people with half a brain so it does seem like Fuck Trump a lot but that #8217;s partly because he #8217;s a fool. Sometimes reddit is Fuck Bezos, sometimes it #8217;s Fuck Musk even, depending on the sub you #8217;re in it can differ who is hated. Most of Reddit hates Trump this is true but here #8217;s the thing though, most of the world hates him as well. I lean way left and at 39 I #8217;m learned that a good 90% of the politicians out there, left or right are full of shit, out to take more than they give and will say anything to get elected. Trump however is on another level of stupidity.</TEXT>

We did one of the great jobs, you say, 'How's President Trump doing?', 'Oh, nothing, nothing.' They have no clue, they don't have any clue. They can't even count their votes in Iowa, they can't even count. No, they can't. They can't count their votes. One of my people came up to me and said, 'Mr. President, they tried to beat you on Russia, Russia, Russia.' That didn't work out too well. They couldn't do it. They tried the impeachment hoax. That was on a perfect conversation. They tried anything, they tried it over and over, they've been doing it since he got in. It's all turning, they lost. It's all turning, think of it, think of it. And this is their new hoax. But you know we did something that's been pretty amazing. We have 15 people in this massive country and because of the fact that we went early, we went early, we could have had a lot more than that." He begins talking about the virus saying the Left is politicizing it, proceeds to list previous confrontations he #8217;s had with the democrats in the past which he lists as hoaxes, then says  #8220;this is their new hoax #8221;. If you really don #8217;t see that as Trump downplaying this then I #8217;m speechless. Honestly he #8217;s said dozens of other things over the past few weeks to downplay this when he could have been acting responsibly, yes obviously a pandemic leaves no other choice really than reactive behaviour but he simply reacted slowly and poorly. On top of that he #8217;s looking to make it even worse by opening things back up on Sunday. But Murica right!</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I believe you #8217;re right. I had a chrome bumper and plain black grill. Lol I actual ordered some 3m 2080 wrap, it #8217;s a good idea and could work but I tried to do it alone with no experience. It looked ok from afar but the closer you got you could see how bad I did, like a garbage bag wrap around the bumper. I ended up finding a steel one for $140 as I sat frustrated from the wrap, painted it myself. I #8217;m gonna give the wrap another try on the rear in a week or so, I think the rear will be easier and I #8217;ll have someone help this time.</TEXT>

The whole neighbourhood is full of them though, I got home from work one July day in 2016 and sat in my car and watched them play tag (really) and chase each other and I counted 26 of them across 5 different properties.</TEXT>

The guys graphic indicates the right side even though his filler spout is on the left, you said left side of car right side of pump which makes no sense if he pulls into a station facing a pump he could back into the left side of the pump from that perspective. More important still is that there are fuel nozzles on both sides of gas pumps so a dash graphic indicating which side of the pump to pull up to would be stupid  #128514;</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Depending on the course and local laws they may have no choice but to enforce those rules. They get busted with outside alcohol they could lose their liquor license. That being said I #8217;m pretty sure most places (local laws) stipulate that if water isn #8217;t provided it #8217;s fair game to bring. My home course has been good they let me bring my little soft cooler out with water even though they have a cart out there. They know I haven #8217;t worked since March  #128514;</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I have a question. When you #8217;re perusing your favourite subreddits and you come across a post about something you have no interest in I assume you don #8217;t click on it but rather flick your thumb upwards to continue browsing. Now when you come across a Trump related post, which I assume from your comment you have no interest in, does it hurt or take longer to thumb up? I #8217;m just trying to figure out why or how the Trump related post fucks up your day so much that you feel the need to comment (which probably takes 1-2 minutes or more) rudely on someone else #8217;s post versus just thumbing up (which in reality probably takes the same amount of time as thumbing up the other two dozen posts that don #8217;t interest you, 1 secondish).  #129335; #127996; #8205; #9794; #65039;</TEXT>

I don #8217;t know if you agree with this at all but if you truly do realize how bad Trump is (maybe not for you personally, but for many he is the difference between a bright future and a grim one or none at all) think about any people on Reddit who may be American, may have a vote, personally I think if all of these incessant posts can push even one or two of them toward a Biden vote then it #8217;s worth it.</TEXT>

    <DATE>2020-10-06 13:30:51</DATE>
    <TEXT>I think I need help from any ladies here but not sure maybe some husbands can help too. My wife says when we go out together she feels like people look at us and wonder what I #8217;m doing with her, as in I #8217;m so hot and her not so much (her opinion of herself, she #8217;s the sexiest woman alive IMO). It affects how much we go out (never) and it makes her afraid to dress up nice feeling like she attracts more attention if she does. Anyone have any advice of anything I could do/say that may help? Update: hi everyone, I posted this the other morning at work and it #8217;s been a hectic week but I have been reading everything you guys have said. I would like to sincerely thank you all for your kindness and wisdom. I kind of knew that this is a  #8216;problem #8217; that I cannot fix, which is extra frustrating because I literally fix all things inanimate so it #8217;s not something I cope with easily. I have done or do just about everything you all suggested. I try not to be over the top or insincere with her and it #8217;s tough when I have a picture of her as my wallpaper because I like to see her throughout the day, and she will roll her eyes or ask me to change it. I guess I was hoping for some golden piece of knowledge or some sorcery of words that simply do not exist. Unfortunately this is indeed an issue she will have to address herself, unfortunately for me she has so far refused any form that may come in (medication, therapy talking to me about any of it etc. I really do appreciate what each of you has shared with me and to those of you that are unhappy with yourselves or reading this thread, I truly do hope you are able to, for a lack of a better term  #8216;figure it out #8217; one day, you seem like good people and good people deserve to be happy.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>The biggest thing for me in all this is that I can #8217;t fathom a motive behind any of these changes. Like when apple removed the headphone jack it was a dick move kinda but it made sense when you look at the AirPods and they wanna sell AirPods obviously. Again dick move but at least they had a reason. This isn #8217;t like Sony #8217;s said but  #8220;hey we #8217;ve added this or this change replaces this thing we took away #8221;, they just fucked with it and stopped. Big wtf from me.</TEXT>
