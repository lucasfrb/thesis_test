    <DATE>2020-10-19 10:38:28</DATE>
    <TEXT> #8203; Hi, my birthday is coming up and i want to ask my parents for a gaming pc. I know most gaming PCs are expensive, so i tried to create a cheap build. It rounds up to about 680 USD without shipping or a monitor or a keyboard or a mouse. So, i'm asking help because i'm very new to building a PC. I'm asking help to the experts for cheaper alternatives to my pc parts, that will still do well more likely than not. Here is the build: MOTHERBOARD: ASUS TUF B450M-PRO GAMING (AM4) MOTHERBOARD CPU: AMD RYZEN 5 3500X 6-CORE 6-THREAD 3.6-4.10GHZ 32MB 65W CHASIS: INPLAY METEOR 02 WHITE ATX TG MID TOWER CASE GPU: GIGABYTE GTX 1650 WINDFORCE OC 4GB GDDR6 GV-N1656WF2OC-4GD RAM: GSKILL RIPJAWS V 8GB DUAL DDR4 3200MHZ CL16 F4-3200C16D-8GVKB PSU: CORSAIR CV550 BRONZE 550WATTS 80+ POWER SUPPLY M.2 SSD: ADATA XPG SX6000 LITE M.2 NVME 128GB (ASX6000LNP-128GT-C) HDD: WESTERN DIGITAL WD BLUE 1TB 64MB HARD DRIVE WD10EZEX https://preview.redd.it/ymj3h4dd51u51.png?width=750 amp;format=png amp;auto=webp amp;s=450952250d4ab9f92af6a9abb03a14ea99be0ba6 These are the parts available from where i live and i would rather you not change the AMD RYZEN 5 because i still want a good gaming pc. Honestly, i'm not looking for a pc that will run 140 FPS +. A gaming PC that will run games smoothly. A PC that isn't slow. A PC that can run most games at 110 FPS below would be great. I'm sorry if what im asking for isn't realistic, but i thank all the people that try and help me out.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Hi, my birthday is coming up and i want to ask my parents for a gaming pc. I know most gaming PCs are expensive, so i tried to create a cheap build. It rounds up to about 680 USD without shipping or a monitor or a keyboard or a mouse. So, i'm asking help because i'm very new to building a PC. I'm asking help to the experts for cheaper alternatives to my pc parts, that will still do well more likely than not. Here is the build: MOTHERBOARD: ASUS TUF B450M-PRO GAMING (AM4) MOTHERBOARD CPU: AMD RYZEN 5 3500X 6-CORE 6-THREAD 3.6-4.10GHZ 32MB 65W CHASIS: INPLAY METEOR 02 WHITE ATX TG MID TOWER CASE GPU: GIGABYTE GTX 1650 WINDFORCE OC 4GB GDDR6 GV-N1656WF2OC-4GD RAM: GSKILL RIPJAWS V 8GB DUAL DDR4 3200MHZ CL16 F4-3200C16D-8GVKB PSU: CORSAIR CV550 BRONZE 550WATTS 80+ POWER SUPPLY M.2 SSD: ADATA XPG SX6000 LITE M.2 NVME 128GB (ASX6000LNP-128GT-C) HDD: WESTERN DIGITAL WD BLUE 1TB 64MB HARD DRIVE WD10EZEX These are the parts available from where i live and i would rather you not change the AMD RYZEN 5 because i still want a good gaming pc. Honestly, i'm not looking for a pc that will run 140 FPS +. A gaming PC that will run games smoothly. A PC that isn't slow. A PC that can run most games at 110 FPS below would be great. I'm sorry if what im asking for isn't realistic, but i thank all the people that try and help me out.</TEXT>
