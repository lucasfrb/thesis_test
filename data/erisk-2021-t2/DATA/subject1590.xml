    <TITLE>Any chance of a PayPal option for Alpha Squad?</TITLE>
    <DATE>2012-09-07 20:28:57</DATE>
    <TEXT>So long story short, my type of card has issues being recognised on anything SOE related. Me (and a few friends) have had this problem for at least a year now. Anything from PSN to any SOE games can't be bought with these cards (they're a type of VISA btw). Anything else, anything will work like normal. Just not anything Sony. But, PayPal does work as far as I can tell. I was just able to use PayPal to buy Station Cash. It's definitely an issue with SOE being unable to read my type of card. While PayPal handles that side of things easily. So I've twittered the usual PS2 crowd and posted on the forums about this with no real response. So now I'm hear, hoping there's someone who can help me in any way. It's frustrating to say the least when I've got to work this hard to give them my money...</TEXT>

    <TITLE>Discussion: Reviews</TITLE>
    <DATE>2014-10-19 15:19:50</DATE>
    <TEXT>I thought this subreddit could do with some constructive discussion. Something to break up the usual stuff. So, for this week anyway, lets talk about how reviews should or could be done. Polygons latest review of Bayonetta 2 built up a lot of controversy due to it's low score compared to the majority of other reviewers. The main reason being the reviewer marking it down for having sexist themes and so on. The usual argument is that it's his opinion. I'd argue that the system in place on most sites makes that a tough point to push. The review system in most sites is score based. That score is then fed into Metacritic which, from we have seen, publishers take an interest in. One that stands out is Fallout New Vegas and the contract Obsidian had with the publisher. They had to reach a certain score on Metacritic to receive royalties. And they missed this mark by a single point. Another issue is that even though it's a single persons opinion, they are giving a game a score that the whole site backs. It's the score Polygon gave as far as the average person knows. And every reviewer has a different idea of what a review score means. One persons eight is another persons six. It just muddies the whole thing. When someone looks up review scores weeks or months after a games release, they aren't going to see the individuals opinion, they'll see a sites review. This is less of an issue for Youtubers. Like Angry Joe. He gives you a 20 to 30 minute review and then a score. But it's clearly his opinion and you can base your decision off of that. Personally, I'd like to see score just fade away. I get that they need a summary at the end so I'd just like to see a summary list of pros and cons. Then you can just base you decision on whether any of the pros or a cons would affect you decision to buy it. But that's just my opinion. I know a good few people who prefer review scores. If wanted to change the standard of how reviews are done, what would you change?</TEXT>

    <TITLE>Final Fantasy X/X-2 HD audio issues</TITLE>
    <DATE>2015-07-31 13:28:28</DATE>
    <TEXT>Hi, I bought Final Fantasy X/X-2 HD for the PS4 the other day. It's as good as I remember but there's one issue I'm having. The audio is a bit choppy. As in sometimes sound will cut out for a brief second. This can happen either during gameplay or even CGI scenes. I've tried using headphones plugged into the controller and audio trough the TV, same result. Is this a known issue or is it something on my end? Thanks. EDIT: Just to add, I've had no issues like this with any other game.</TEXT>

    <TITLE>[Rebirth #1 Spoilers] Superman</TITLE>
    <DATE>2016-05-27 11:46:08</DATE>
    <TEXT>So. I haven't really seen it brought up here and maybe there are leaks out about this already but, can we just talk about Post Superman for a minute. There was a bit of dialogue in Rebirth were this hooded character, Mr Oz, says that Post Supes and his family are not what they believe they are and neither was New 52 Supes. So mix that in with the knowledge that the New 52 universe is the Post-Crisis universe, just altered by a powerful force. Post Supes believes his universe was gone and that he and his family were refugees on a new universe, a new Earth. But this is his Earth, he, like Wally, weren't altered or changed due to Flashpoint and Dr M because they were outside of the universe/multiverse at the time. So if he is the Superman of this universe, what does that make New 52 Superman? Possibly a creation of Dr M to fill in the hole Post Supes created? Not saying New 52 Supes had any knowledge of that, just that Dr M needed a Superman for the Earth.</TEXT>

    <TITLE>For those who still suffer from stuttering</TITLE>
    <DATE>2018-05-25 23:43:42</DATE>
    <TEXT>Ok so I'm making this thread for every poor soul who has gone crazy searching for an answer for why this game stutters for them even on high end systems. You've tried everything from setting graphics to low, locking the framerate to 30fps, trying the special-k mod and every other tip and trick out there. I've done all of this, I've even changed from a 6600k with 16GB ram to an 8700k with 32GBs of ram and a fresh Win 10 install. I didn't upgrade specifically for FFXV but I was definitely interested in seeing if it would fix the stuttering/hitching. It didn't. I have a GTX 1080 btw. But I seem to have finally fixed my issue. All I did was went into my Nvidia Settings, Manage 3D settings, Program Settings where I selected FFXV and then changed Power Management Mode to "prefer maximum performance". I've been running around the Hammerhead area with zero stutters since. That's the first time since I've had the game. I'm presuming the other power options, Optimal and Adaptive, caused my GPU to fluctuate which caused the stutters. Now maybe this won't work for you, but if you're just googling for an answer and come across this post, give it a try.</TEXT>

I'd be shocked if they weren't dying for another reason to get rid of her. And this was their chance to do so. What Jim looked at was the end of something much more toxic than he realised.

    <DATE>2018-09-15 14:56:36</DATE>
    <TEXT>So how much harder is Super Strong Monsters? I'm about to start the game but after looking around and seeing comments about how easy the game is I thought I might do Super Strong Monsters but then it seems to be that you eventually hit a wall at that difficulty. So the choice seems to be Very Easy or Very Hard. Anyone have real experience with **both** options? I'd try Super Strong but I'm worried I'll end up reverting to normal mode after it ramps up the difficulty too high and then I'm far too over leveled for normal. **Edit:** I've decided to go with *Reduced exp from easy fights* as a sort of middle ground between Regular and Super Strong Monsters and so far so good. It pretty much puts a halt to grinding Exp once you hit a certain level in areas and I don't feel like I'm trying to avoid battles in fear of over leveling. Plus I can grind for gold if I want without over leveling. It might be something I turn off in the later parts of the game but for now it balances things out nicely for me.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>If I remember right, when they had the story about Half Life 3 being cancelled by Valve, they brought up that it's partly because of gamer backlash like with Mass Effect 3 and that Valve worried they'd receive similar backlash. Which never made much sense to me. Simplest answer, to me at least, was that Valve wasn't interested in game development and isn't their main source of profit anymore and finally pulled the cord on something that was pretty much dead in the water anyway. I don't think the likes of Valve or Sony give a shit about gamer backlash as long as it doesn't effect profits too much. And even then, I don't really remember any real backlash against Sony last year. Alanah is probably right, they're just putting everything into PSX, Nintendo has proved you can just do your own thing in the age of streaming.</TEXT>

It's basically a supernatural murder mystery and that just interested me a lot more than P5s story that seems to revolve around society. And since I come from a small town, the setting appealed to me more. But when it comes to gameplay and style, P5 wins out. It's so much more refined and polished than P4s.</TEXT>

    <TEXT> gt;Even the deceptive upbeat tone of the game juxtaposing the murder mystery is on-point when you consider the overarching theme about "Truth", and how it's about rejecting the harsher truth for favorable lies. I also found that upbeat tone gave a sort of creepy vibe to it that kept me on edge early on. Like, you're in this quiet rural town and this young girl in your class is found murdered only days ago and here you are walking alone with this upbeat background music. I always felt like the killer could be watching you. I felt like everything was slightly "off". Helped that it was my first Persona game so I had no idea what to expect.</TEXT>

If I had some back up maybe something would change but, as much as I like my coworker, he's a bit of a kiss ass and hates any conflict so will smile and nod to everything while also agreeing with me about the current situation. Big issue I have is the lack of real roles and organisation. Everyone is doing everything. I got it to a point where I had certain roles and my co-worker had others and within 6 weeks one of the the owner had a coworker doing my jobs because he wanted them done asap instead of the next day (made no difference as it wasn't time sensitive) and my coworker had enough on his plate as it was so I took on some of his and now we're back to square one.</TEXT>

And it's pretty much come true, he's been drowned out by not just the other Spider characters but by the number of other heroes in 616. When he first came on it felt like every other page had another hero character shoved in. In Ultimate, the character had room to breath and develop with a far more interesting story of him inheriting and trying to make the Spider-Man name his own. Even Spider-Verse realized that was a more interesting take. Sure there's other Spiders but he's the only one of his universe and his Parker still died.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I've always found that Superior reads so much better now that it's finished and you can go from start to finish as the actual run felt dragged out and you're just waiting for Peters return. As a finished series it feels more like 1 big complete story, a beginning, middle and end with real character development. But, I ended up reading the bulk of Janes Thor in the space of a week and honestly, it felt kind of hollow in comparison. The bulk of it is just Jane reacting to Malekiths plots while building up to the actual War of the Realms once they got past the mystery of who Thor was. Overall it feels like, from the start of the War of the Realms arc, that it's Thor Odinsons story with Jane just stepped in while Aaron set up the pieces for the main event and then puts Odinson back into the spotlight. It wasn't really bad or anything but nothing really memorable except for Russell Dautermans art and the Shi'ar gods (really cool design). I'm looking forward to seeing what the MCU does with Janes Thor, that could end up being far more interesting and the idea of passing on a legacy makes more sense in the MCU when it's a given that certain characters will bow out permanently as actors move on.</TEXT>

    <TEXT> gt; That GE however will likely either decimate the Tories and get the Brexit party into power Like, Farages Brexit Party? I don't know, I don't know enough but I wouldn't have thought the party even has the numbers to get into power? Seems more like a quickly done up protest party. That and I think Nigel would shit himself and run if it even came close to that. I seriously doubt he wants any kind of real responsibility in any of this, he just wants the fame and money.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Especially with Bungie. They really made their games back then for a specific platform with specific hardware. They squeezed as much as they could out of the 360. Even when the 360 had the feature to load whole games on to your HDD for faster load times, Bungie warned people not to do that with Halo 3 as it wasn't built with that in mind and would actually cause slower loading. Because they made the game to load off the disc in such a specific way. And Reach, from everything I've seen and heard, is far more complicated. I do not envy 343 trying to untangle all these unique *solutions* Bungie came up with for the 360. It's why I can't imagine MGS4 on the PS3 would ever get a port. That game was solely made for the PS3 and it's very unique hardware, I'd bet it would be an absolute nightmare to port to anything else.</TEXT>

Nearly 5 years at this job and I swear it's slowly eaten away at me mentality and physically. Tbh I'll probably be let go within a few months at this rate. It's one of those jobs were everyone's smiling and super enthusiastic and so on, on the surface anyway. Family run with endless micromanagement and rules that could change at a moments notice that you'd have to be a mind reader to keep up with. It feels like an abusive relationship. Faking that shit 5 days a week is nigh on impossible and after so many years it's starting to show how I just can't anymore.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I really liked episode 1 and thought it set things up nicely. I was looking forward to how it would continue but every episode after that felt like episode 2. The writing just was't there. And I wasn't a big fan of Jodies Doctor being another version of Tennants doctor. At least that how it came across to me. I thought nothing of it in the first episode because usually, right after regeneration, they're full of energy and quirky and weird because they've just been reborn and don't really know their personality yet which usually takes shape throughout the season. But it never came. As Jodies Doctor said: "Right now, I'm a stranger to myself. There's echoes of who I was and a sort of call to who I am and I have to trust all of these new instincts. Shape myself towards them." But, since the season didn't really progress much, she didn't progress either. Just, give them better writing and some kind of direction for the show at least.</TEXT>

So maybe Eddie finally couldn't get enough meals in and met his own end. Though I don't think Venom even had a host the last time we saw it in Miles Ultimates Spider-Man run before Secret Wars so Eddie could be long dead.</TEXT>

So Raditz at the beginning is a higher level with higher health, attack damage and so on so it's not just an even fight. Still, it would have been nice to have the original Dragon Ball story in this, even if it just served as the prologue or something. **EDIT:** And I hope it goes the opposite way too, like we play as Trunks vs lower leveled Frieza or Vegeta destroying Android 19.</TEXT>

In the Ultimate U, he was free of that, living up to Peters legacy was something that is a part of his character but that was it. Also, Hickmans Ultimate run was just great.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I've found last season and this season to be very weak if at times just awful but I thought this was the strongest episode so far. Plus I found the "new" Doctor genuinely entertaining. It's meant to fuck with continuity, even the Doctor doesnt understand what's going on. It doesnt sync up with any timeline we know of and the whole point is to figure out why. It's a part of the whole seasons overall plot that was started back in ep 2 of last season. And I think this "new" Doctor was actually far more interesting imo. Morally she's a lot more grey for one, had the confidence and "presence" that the Doctor always had that I dont think Jodie has really pulled off yet. She honestly felt more like the Doctor than the actual Doctor. Plus we got a Jack Harkness cameo which I loved. I'm fine with others not liking the episode but for me, it's the most fun I've had watching Dr Who in a long time.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I don't know, I can definitely see and feel the difference between 60 and 120 FPS. It feels buttery smooth and is a bit jarring going back to 60 if you're used to 100+ in a particular game. But it depends on the game too. I'll notice the difference a lot more when playing something fast paced like Apex Legends than I would in Yakuza Kiwami 2 or Res 2 Remake. Not that I think we'll ever really hit 120 FPS in many games, especially with 4k in mind. But it would be nice to see it in older games. Something I hope the PS5 will do too, just to see what something like GOW can do in uncapped mode.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Yeah it's very noticeable in any fast paced FPS game. I play Apex quite a bit and trying 60FPS when I'm used to 100+ felt so different. But I'll happily lock a game to 60FPS if it's slower paced and helps offer a more consistent framerate like Res 2 Remake.</TEXT>

All of the Midgar section was about fighting Shinra and rescuing Aerith at the end. As far as I can see from what has been shown so far, Sephiroth is there as a hallucination like he was in most of FF7. And Cloud already had blackouts in the Midgar section so it isn't a big change really.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>DC seems to have an issue where they can't decide on the next generation. They either put them in the spotlight and build them up or they shelve them for no obvious reason. Seems to be DC Editorial constantly fighting each other on whether to keep the same status-quo of the last few decades that they grew up with or develop new interesting characters. Dick Grayson was always a fan favourite but he constantly has to deal with either being in the spotlight or getting absolutely shit on. Latest being the whole ["Ric"](https://i.pinimg.com/originals/c8/01/cb/c801cb874c3b71a1f8b2b24b465bd9df.jpg) stunt. Wally has had the same issue, getting completely wiped from continuity until reappearing in Rebirth which was met with huge positivity only to [destroy his character](https://insidepulse.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Flash-Forward-1-spoilers-3.jpg) for a mediocre and forgettable story. And now Jon who was introduced in Rebirth, was a huge favourite and help enrich and develop the Superman story. Only for Bendis to shelve him, then age him up in a horrendous way ([imprisoned in a volcano for years by an evil version of his own dad](https://www.cosmicteams.com/legion/profiles/images/legion4/superman-v5-09.jpg)).

Then it would take me way longer than average to pass the game due to not having as much time. So when I finally get round to the next game on my list, it could have been out for a few months. It definitely has its pros. You'll have a game that should be polished after patches, the hype has died down so you have proper expectations so you're not as likely to be disappointed and you'll nearly always have another game to play right after you finish one. And it's cheaper. Usually.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Just to play devils advocate here since I think it might be a bit of a gray area in some cases and worth talking about. Say someone was made redundant say 2-3 weeks before the crisis. If it can be shown and proved that they had a chance at employment recently with businesses (interviews, etc) and that those businesses now have to close potentially causing that person to loose his or her chance at employment then I think a case *could* be made. Now I'm not going to say they should be automatically given the extra payment but I think it warrants a look at by a case by case basis. Not that I would think this is something someone who has been unemployed for a year should be qualified for. More like someone who was unfortunate enough to be let go or made redundant at the same time this all kicked off leaving them with little to no options in employment. Worth a thought anyway, it's a complicated situation to be honest and it's all fairly new territory for us.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Well that's my job gone. Completely closing up shop over the next 2 weeks and that'll be it for good. To be honest I was already thinking of leaving, was burnt out and the owner wasn't listening to anyone, wasn't taking in any advice, just business as usual and focusing on little things rather than the big picture. It was like putting out a house fire by watering the garden plants. The writing was on the wall and this whole crisis just sped things up a few months. I'm fine though, got a pretty generous redundancy and savings that I've been building for a while and I'm debt free. That along with the  #8364;350, I could go a solid year without work and not change my spending habits. Not that I would but at least I'm not stressing out about money like a lot of people right now. Plus the stress of the place has definitely been affecting me both mentally and physically. My stomach has been doing back flips, I had a constant headache from stress and anxiety and I've just been low on energy. That all pretty much washed away after the announcement. Gonna focus on me for a little bit, go binge my Netflix and game backlog, read a book or two, relax and then get myself in order.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>This week will be interesting. I know more than a few people who can't sit still for 5 minutes let alone two full weeks. Since the announcement on Thursday night there's been enough going on to distract everyone but now the real test of patience begins. By next week I'll be shocked if there aren't people who'll just break the "lockdown" rules because they can't stick it anymore. And I keep seeing on my facebook feed people arguing about how long this will really take, answers ranging all over the place. Some thinking we'll be in the pubs by Monday 13th after we *"kill off"* the virus to those thinking we'll be locked in our houses till December. Some of those arguments are getting heated too. Like, don't freak out about that stuff. I just look at what the HSE is saying. Which is, as of right now, that they're planning for a peak by 10th-14th but that they "do not know for sure when the peak would be". And that's it, no point in losing your mind studying charts or percentages trying to crack it, just have to be patient and wait it out.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>From Simon Harris when asked on the radio today if the restrictions will continue after Easter Sunday:  #8220;*Will the measure be extended beyond Easter Sunday? I #8217;ve got to be truthful, I don #8217;t know. I think these measures are so restrictive and significant that you cannot leave them in place for a very long time.*  #8220;*The judgement call our doctors had to make was, what is the right time to bring these measures in? So what we #8217;re planning to do is going intensively at this now for a couple of weeks so that when we get to Easter Sunday we can see some progress.*  #8220;*Everything can #8217;t go back to normal  #8211; it would be a complete fantasy to think that would happen. This virus will be with us for many months but is there some things we can lift on Easter Sunday? That is what we are all hoping.* #8221; I know too many people who imagine after these two weeks we'll just slip back into our normal lives over the next week or so. Like, I'm not saying don't be positive and optimistic but at the same thing you have to be realistic otherwise you're gonna find all this a lot harder to deal with long term.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>They dont seem to know themselves yet. Going by comments by the government, they'll evaluate the situation once we start getting near the end of the current lockdown. But we most likely wont be seeing things go back to normal anytime soon, just revisions and tweaks to the current restrictions. Hopefully loosening some restrictions in some cases. To quote Simon Harris yesterday: "Will the measure be extended beyond Easter Sunday? I #8217;ve got to be truthful, I don #8217;t know. I think these measures are so restrictive and significant that you cannot leave them in place for a very long time.  #8220;The judgement call our doctors had to make was, what is the right time to bring these measures in?

    <TEXT>Some people have no sense at all. I only went to the local shop for bread, eggs and milk and I spent a solid 20-25 minutes waiting outside. Just because two pensioners would not stop chatting inside the shop and then spending forever digging through their purse for change, then deciding they want something else, then strolling over to get it, then deciding they want a lotto ticket and so on. Eventually the person behind the till just grabbed his stuff and "helped" put it in the car. But the pensioner just turns around to chat to the one behind her. Cashier has to tell them to move on. All the while some fella parks up, gets out and strolls up to the shop. Before he goes in I tell him to go back behind me and he gets thick, says he's only picking up milk and I tell him so am I but we all have to wait. So he decides to stand right behind me, I have to tell him to step back and he aint happy about that but does it. Then someone else comes along and tries the same thing, I tell him the same thing and he goes right next to the other fella and they chat away about how mad all this is and complaining about how long this lockdown is. Lads, there's a reason this is all in place and their the kind of people that cause this shit to go on longer than it might have had to if we had all just done what we where told. It aint rocket science. Jesus christ, I've a headache from just picking up some fucking milk.</TEXT>

It seems to be a bit random so I doubt were seeing accurate results. Wouldn't shock me if tomorrows numbers are either well into the 300's or even lower than today. Until this shortage is sorted it's gonna be all over the place in results. I don't know about ICU or deaths, I haven't seen anything about how those are being included.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Well this just came up from Simon Coveney: *"I think people do need to realise that these restrictions may go on for some time," Mr Coveney told a briefing this morning.* *"We've set an initial period but I think it may well be that we will need to go beyond that initial deadline, but again that will be a decision take with the best public health advice."* [Link](https://www.rte.ie/news/coronavirus/2020/0402/1128025-government-launches-new-community-call-initiative/) And Simon Harris had a video on twitter yesterday going over some stuff including questions. Obviously one question was asking if the restrictions will be extended. To summarize it, his answer was basically: *We need to see how things go, the more progress we make the more likely it is that we can start to look at how we can ease those restrictions. No one wants to leave these restrictions but we have to do what we have to do to save lives.* If I had to take a guess, this will be extended until the end of April for now. Best outcome is restrictions are eased for that period but I doubt even they're sure yet.</TEXT>

Also noticed at least 3 different businesses who have been closed as they're non-essential have the lights on today. Still closed to the public as far as I can see but still. Not sure why, maybe the owners or managers running in to grab stuff but it's a bit weird multiple different businesses doing this at once. We're not even a full week in to this "lockdown".</TEXT>

    <TEXT> gt; I genuinely start to worry how many businesses will even be able to open again once the lock-down is over. This is me probably being overly optimistic but my hope is that when this finally comes to an end, we'll see a bounce back. People are going to want to go out, eat out, shop etc after having all that taken for so long. So while there'll no doubt be businesses that will struggle and close during these restrictions, there'll hopefully be room for new ones to take advantage of that new potential. And unlike last time, the government won't be bailing out the banks with billions of euro that ended up crippling us, that they'll support the local businesses and the average person affected by this so when the time comes we can hit the ground running. I know that's super optimistic and simplified but it's a hope I like to have.</TEXT>

They likely have different plans in place but it's gonna rely on the next few days on what one is gonna be used. If I had to guess, they'll make some kind of announcement on Thursday or Friday next week. It could be an extension of the lockdown by a week or to the end of the month or we could be lucky and it'll be loosening of some restrictions, be it travel distance, some non-essentials re-opening, etc. I doubt we'd be that lucky but we're all just figuring it out as we go.

    <TEXT>In terms of mental health during the the lockdown, I'm actually doing pretty good. It's one of those times were the internet has made a world of difference. We have all forms of media from shows to movies, books, games, music, etc that we have near instant access to. Plus being able to chat to people pretty easily online, through FB, Whatsapp, etc. Even able to video chat with the grandmother while shes under lockdown at the nursing home. Even being able to learn something new, be it a skill or language is easily available online. All this kind of stuff makes current life a whole lot more bearable than if this had happened pre-broadband. Now sure, I had plans for this year in terms of changes in my life from work to relationships only for this lockdown to put everything on hold. It's basically put everything on hold for the year, which causes anxiety at the idea I'm wasting a chunk of a year of my life, it's the same part of my brain that just randomly screams at me that I'm not doing enough because I decided to sit down for more than 10 minutes. Also, no amount of running hits the same itch I have for going to a proper gym, god I miss the gym. But then I just remind myself everyone is in the same boat and it's out of my hands. When the dust settles I'll hit the ground running but for now I'll do what I can.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>They said we would have had a peak in 20 days from now if we hadn't done anything with 100,000 cases a day. And it would have been 40 days from now with around 60,000 cases a day if we had stuck to the first restrictions just before the lockdown. Now they're hoping that we won't have a real peak, but that we'll retain numbers similar to now but over an extended period of time as long as we keep doing what were doing now.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Same Lockdown as the last 2 weeks. Non-essential businesses, schools and so on closed. No travelling beyond 2k of home except for essential needs like grocery shopping. And Garda #237; extra powers that were put in place recently to enforce restrictions (such as fines of up to  #8364;2,500 and up to six months in prison in worse case scenarios) have been extended to match the lockdown extension.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Yeah, it's all gotten a bit out of hand. This was all kind of funny at first but it devolved pretty quickly. Now everyone is just overreacting and trying to act the victim.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Well, finally shaved the head. And I think I actually prefer it. Plus it's a lot fucking cheaper in the long term.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>DLSS 2.0 is what I'm most excited for in the future. If done right it be a huge performance boost for lower to mid level cards.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I'm noticing some are starting to crack a little. Not surprising, it's been 3 weeks or so since the lockdown with a little over 2 more weeks to go before we know what happens next. It's not the majority or anything, just a few. Bunch of Guards up by the GAA breaking up a fairly large group this morning. I was walking the dog and the lads who weren't kids were kicking up a storm. The other night they had to break up a house party. The owner of the local shop was giving out at how some aren't following the social distancing rules in place (only 2 in the store at a time and following the floor guides). Said they had no problem the first week or so following the rules but they're getting lax about the rules as time goes on. I'd say it's still only a small minority but things are bound to slip a little as time goes on.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>This lockdown has been the easy part compared to what might come next. At some point restrictions will slowly ease up but how a lot of businesses will function is gonna be tough to figure out. Not to mention if you lost your job during all this it's gonna be tough to find a new job in this current environment. Hell, I had a drivers test coming up just before this all kicked off, so that's been on hold which limits a lot of my future plans. This has all been necessary obviously, but we're in for a tough few months no matter how I look at it and I see no end to that until an actual vaccine arrives that will let us all get back to normal. And that aint happening in 2 weeks to say the least.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Well if theres one pro to all this it's that I've time to binge video games again like I'm a kid. I passed Final Fantasy VII Remake last night, usually that would have lasted me at least 2-3 months but passed it after a little over a week. I see Simon Harris came out saying we cant get complacent over the restrictions just because were keeping it under control right now. Makes sense, I've noticed some are letting things slip, be it chatting with people while not keeping distance, ignoring shop rules and Guards had to crack down on local lads going up to the local GAA. It's been weeks now with another 2 to go, people are bound to crack a little. Unfortunately until we have a real vaccine, things just cant go right back to normal, there'll have to be some restrictions even under the best conditions. Otherwise all this work put in up to now will be lost and were right back to square one. The good weather isnt gonna help either. **Edit:** Think I'll start Persona 5 Royal, probably the only chance I'll have to play a game that huge.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>No spoilers, you've still a good bit to go. My full playtrough was hitting 40 hours. I think there's around 17 chapters in total and you should be around chapter 7 or 8.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Apart from the ending being overly complicated and meta, I didn't mind the end result basically being "the story now doesn't have to be 100% the same". That's fine, no issue there with me so far. But the whole Zack multiple timeline stuff has me concerned this is going to get incredibly convoluted on top of a story that is already complicated enough. I was hoping this remake would actually try to simplify and streamline the original story a bit while fleshing it out. I don't see how that can end well or not need a whole wikipedia section trying to explain even the most basic elements of it to understand. We didn't need the whole time ghosts to explain changes either, most people didn't expect a 1 to 1 remake when the first game was just Midgar anyway.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Very, very good overall. Characters feel more fleshed out and if you're a fan of the original there's more than a few scenes that'll make you smile ear to ear. And genuinely funny, goofy moments too. It remembered that the original wasn't always dark and gritty. Not many sidequests. They're pretty basic but don't take much time. Overall, I'd recommend the game. Without any spoilers, the ending is interesting. I'm not crazy about it but I'm not gonna spoil anything.</TEXT>

That's fine, no issue there with me so far. Don't see why we needed an in-game story for that since it's a remake not a remaster but whatever.

    <TEXT>Yeah, like right after the first Reno fight at the church. I was genuinely annoyed when they showed up and pulled me out of the scene. A better option is that more Shinra soldiers show up right as Cloud is about to finish Reno, start shooting and Cloud is shielding the gunfire and Aerith says they can run into the back room. Better flow and can lead to a scene of Aerith giving out to Cloud about trying to kill Reno which connects to the scene further back of Tifa being scared of Cloud talking about killing Johnny which can lead to some character development.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Their playtrough of Last of Us had me roll my eyes a few times when Troy would stop any conversation to let everyone know how well acted the current scene is and then go into how deep it is etc. Felt like it happened every 10 minutes. I can't remember what part it is but Troy tried to dramatize the behind the scenes of a part the game cutscene only for Nolan to say he doesn't remember it happening that way as he was on scene that day. Love the guy but he kind of gets a bit self absorbed at times while Nolan is a bit more care free and goofy, doesn't take himself that seriously. I think that's what kind of made Retro Replay work though.</TEXT>
