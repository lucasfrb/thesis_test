    <TEXT>First of all, hello. I did not come here to fight. But I want to bring clarity to everything, and of course this is my own opinion. I want to say that it all started in March 1918 with the killing of 10,000-20,000 Azerbaijanis by Armenians. Let's start with September days - what is being done here is in the hands of the Ottomans, so I do not know how right you are to blame us. The resurrection of every country is with blood. The Ottomans shed this blood. Khaibalikend - The man in charge was of Kurdish origin. If you read the continuation of this massacre, you will see that after the arrival of Azerbaijani soldiers, the Armenians were placed in their homes. The Shusha massacre - was a committed by the Tatars, directed by a commander of Kurdish origin. They said that you have to be in the same population after that. But the Armenians committed the March genocide. Kirovabad pogrom - Empty. There is so much misinformation that it is not clear who is right and who is wrong. Some may call it the genocide of Azerbaijanis. After that, it started after the Armenians killed civilian Azerbaijanis in Karabakh. My uncle helped the Armenians in Sumgayit and Baku to leave. They said how the Armenians living in the neighborhood built beautiful houses. At least we could be good friends. It is too late to correct mistakes. I may be wrong. Just fix it properly.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Do you know what you are saying? It was the Armenians who did this in the 1988-1994 wars. The war has already been started by Armenians. It has been going on for years. As I said, we did not bring them to the war zone. They stay where they want. It is Armenia's job to bring civilians to the war zone. Do you give up the land you have lived in for so many years? Imagine that ur family was killed there. If he doesn't want a war, why did he keep soldiers in another country?</TEXT>

    <TEXT>It seems that you did not know about the Karabakh genocide. Old, young and children were killed by Armenians. Is this your referendum? How right is it to have the right to land after killing Azerbaijanis? It is madness to send civilians to a place where war is going on. We are not responsible if they are injured while clearing our lands from enemy soldiers.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>[Here](https://aqreqator.az/az/cemiyyet/1039452) picture of two children killed by Armenians. I did not say that I am not trust both sides. I just said the numbers are exaggerated. It is very interesting why the Khankendi and Karabakh armenians were not moved during the war. Does Armenia want to kill civilians to justify itself? Aha I watched. There is probably injured ppl. After the return of Karabakh to Azerbaijan, the rules will apply to both sides. The Defense Ministry issued a statement on this. He does not lie about it. If he lies, he knows what awaits him. He's not stupid.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>What you didn't understand that it was a counterattack. If they want to continue living there, they should not complain that "they opened fire on us." We are waging war on our lands. I said that these massacres started in March and 10.000-20.000 Azerbaijanis died there. Not hundreds, thousands Azerbaijanis. If so, then let's look at Russia's occupation of Georgia as normal or Turkey's occupation of Crimea. Thanks! After winning, I will share a photo from Karabakh  #10084; #65039;.

But I think that Armenia should have evacuated civilians before firing. If they are smart enough, they will see Azerbaijan is right. The death of hundreds of other Azerbaijanis would be very bad.

    <TEXT>l am surprised why the Armenian people still support him. This is a man who moves his people to hell, he promotes Nazianism similar to Hitler's ideology. He says that Armenia is ready for negotiations, and then goes to Karabakh (occupied territory) and says: "Karabakh is ours and we will not give them a gram of land!', Despite the fact that Armenia has occupied additional 7 regions, which have nothing to do with Karabakh! This person propagandizes the ideology of Great Armenia, so that you understand, it is as if Putin stands up and says, "We are returning the USSR! We are capturing all countries." Sometimes it seems to me that the poor Armenians who live abroad do not know what the politicians are doing with their country, with their people. Pashinyan tells everyone that poverty in the country and all sources of troubles in Armenia are Turkey and Azerbaijan, well damn it, are you serious? Think about what this person says, it's stupid. Not a single Armenian president allowed himself the statements that Pashinyan speaks now at the international arena. Everyone turned away from Pashinyan, he sends young guys to die. Pashinyan has been actively provoking Baku since July. He did this in order to completely break off the negotiations, thinking that this would force Russia into conflict over geopolitical goals. He also hoped that Armenia would be supported because "We are Christians and we are one of the oldest peoples in the world" (Remember Hitler) But it doesn't work that way. No one understood what Pashinyan wanted, as a result, the patience of the Azerbaijani government ran out and they launched a counterattack, since everyone was already tired of the fact that Armenia was attacking Azerbaijani villages with impunity, everyone was tired of the civilians of Azerbaijan being killed for 30 years. The Azerbaijani government has been trying to conduct peace negotiations for 30 years. Don't believe the Kardashians. If someone's voice is louder, it does not mean that it is right.</TEXT>

    <TEXT> gt; Hi, do you think it's considered genocide, or a massacre? What will change for you? Would you be more relieved if I said it was a massacre?  gt; How were 500,000-1,000,000 Azeris displaced You mean, could Armenians have killed them? If this is the question, the headline of the newspaper is the answer.  gt; if Armenians wanted to end the Azeri race why weren't the massacres widespread? In fact, they did more massacres. The March and Guba genocides are examples of this.  gt; If what the Azeri government is saying is true and we wanted to get rid of the Azeri race why was the highest massacre only 161 deaths? 12,000 Azerbaijanis died in the March genocide.  gt;I'm not saying you denied the occurrence Armenian massacres. I was just pointing out the fact that some Azeris might've just learned about the Khojaly massacre and didn't know about the ones done to Armenians. WTF? I take this as a joke. If you tell this to any Azerbaijani, he will call you ignorant. The Khojaly genocide is said to every Azerbaijani from the first to the last grade. It is even written on the back of books.  gt; but would you concede that most Azerebjianis also don't know the whole story/picture. Believe me, they know everything by heart.  gt;Both governments don't want their people to know what happened if it makes them look bad so both the Armenian and Azeri government don't openly talk about/teach about the full story. Many Azerbaijanis live in Sumgayit and Baku. In other words, even if they do not say what happened in the lessons, a very old Azerbaijani knows what happened to the Armenians.  gt;Also, don't you think the Azeri government wants to demonize Armenians for nationalism purposes? Same is true with the Armenian government. Yes, it is racism on both sides.</TEXT>

    <TEXT> gt;I just don't like the characterization of calling it a genocide since it's weaponized against Armenians to lower the severity of the Armenian genocide. (This is mostly done by Turkish lobbyists who if asked about the Armenian geocide say Khojaly genocide when they aren't comparable. I did not know much about the dispute between the Ottomans and Armenia. I heard that the Armenians revolted in the Ottoman Empire during the war.  gt; I was saying if Armenians wanted to exterminate them/genocide doesn't make sense we didn't kill more. We didn't want to kill them there obviously could've been idiots who killed civilians, but it wasn't organized. The killing of 613 people seems to have been organized. Because I don't think you have an idiot in your army who can kill so many people. Maybe there is?  gt; You didn't understand what I said "Azeris learned about Khojaly massacre, but didn't know about the ones done to Armenians. I'm saying most Azeris know about times they were killed by Armenians. However, they don't know about the times they killed Armenians most of the time. (They are not to blame obviously their education system will not cover that) If we look at all the figures, we see that more Azerbaijanis are killed. But I don't want to start a conversation about who killed more. Cuz this is disgusting. But yes, many teenagers don't know what happen in Sumgayit and Baku. Just as Khojaly is not included in Armenian history lessons, Sumgayit and Baku pogroms are not included in our history lessons.  gt; Even the times Armenian civilians were targeted? My main thing I'm trying to get across is it's important to look at both sides and see the full picture. Azerbaijan is just bombing own city. Armenia can send civilians back to Armenia.</TEXT>

Apparently, only Armenians are worried about not sharing. No no 500,000 dead. Do Armenians drive tanks with cartons? Money is invested in Azerbaijani manats. It works. Considering that we are in a war and money is going to the army, the value of the manat is very good. Good to know. How can we know that the Armenians would bomb the second largest city? This is a disgrace. Yes, I like tank fucks.  gt;international terrorism ASALA liked that. LOL. I would like to remind you of the train bombing committed by Armenians in Baku.

    <TEXT> gt;Bruh you said every Azeri even the children are even more interested in war than ever, I think you count you, yourself to all Azeris, don't you? You said you want war and I said we won't step back then! You need to read better. You understand my words differently. I do not remember using the word 'children'. But after the Armenian fire and the start of the war, the Azerbaijanis became very angry. I did not say I want a war. I said that if there is no way to peace, we will fight.  gt;There are also some photos of Azeris holding false posters with those pictures, so they are being used, not from you but still. Yeah, Sure lol  gt;The Armenian church of Shushi (Shusha) is older than Azerbaijan itself, I mean even Coca Cola is older than Azerbaijan itself. Armenians have been living there on the other hand for centuries. So why do you think it is only your homeland, why do you think it should be part of Azerbaijan and not independent? Why won't you read some historical facts, which are obviously hidden by your states propaganda. Use the Internet via VPN if it is restricted or if you are afraid to go to jail for that. Aaa yesss ZE GRIIT TIGRAN or something like that. You say that if Lenin rises, I will gladly give my lands to him. It doesn't look like a smart idea.  gt;I have already answered where is the connection of Aliyev's clan and propaganda by dishonoring of the victims of other massacres like the Armenian Genocide (using their picture for own propaganda) or Khojaly Yeah I remember that bullshit. Or am I?  #8203; Edit: Going to sleep. I'm tired of empty loops. Good night</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I was talking about Lenin, not you. You can't understand We had to talk about the ethnic cleansing living there. We had to talk about the ethnic cleansing living there. In fact, Karabakh was not given to Azerbaijan, Karabakh remained in Azerbaijan. It has never belonged to Armenia. It is a fact that 60-70 percent of your culture is stolen from Azerbaijanis and the Turks. If Armenia leaves Azerbaijan land, there will be peace. You know very well who the invader is. We are talking in the comments of the Independent newspaper at the moment. At least pay attention.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>In fact, there is. After the start of the war, Armenia thought that it would continue the occupation with the support of the Russian army and create Karabakh. Russia said the war did not take place in Armenia. Armenia is alone now :( It seems that while fighting terrorism, you forgot for a moment that you created terrorism. LOL It seems that you are very worried about Azerbaijan's support from Turkey. Yes, he will take a step back after the re-capture of Karabakh. Yerevan was Azerbaijan land. Unlike Armenia, we are not occupying Yerevan and leaving thousands homeless. Because we are not terrorists</TEXT>

I am not saying that Azerbaijan is free to bomb. I mean, the civilians had to be removed before they opened fire. The fact that Karabakh is a country is already empty. Such a thing will not happen as long as Azerbaijanis live. I repeat, Azerbaijan is bombing own lands.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Armenia was firing because thought that military support would come from Russia when the war broke out. Russia did not provide military support to Armenia. If Russia had helped Armenia, Azerbaijan's re-capture would have failed. But it did not happen. Russia left Armenia alone. Azerbaijan's recapture of Karabakh continues successfully. If not successful, all countries would begin to recognize Karabakh as a country. At this moment, Aze MoD posted a video. Watch on youtube and see how the Armenian army violated the ceasefire. Aliyev's start of the operation does not mean that Azerbaijan started the war. Armenia should have thought before violating the ceasefire. Those living there are not civilians of Azerbaijan. Azerbaijani civilians have been expelled from the region.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>There will be no such place after the war. No, they belong to the Karabakh region. You probably haven't read the resolutions well. Even if it is related to those around it, the occupation still continues there. ( Yes, the whole world belonged to Armenians lol ) Negotiations will end only if all Karabakh belongs to Azerbaijan. This event will take place soon. Do Armenians believe in this tale? 3 apples fall from the sky during the story? I will come to Karabakh with both the army and peace. Maybe I talked to a couple of Armenians about how they lost.</TEXT>

    <TEXT> gt;Where did I say that? The link you said about Armenia violating the ceasefire is from Azeri Mod. I said that's from the Azeri MoD I didn't say to believe Armenian MoD.  gt;  gt;I said. if Azeri government says Armenia violated ceasefire, and Armenian government says it was Azerbaijan, no one really knows right? So if that's the case why don't we implement independent ceasefire monitoring by OSCE. The country that speaks out against Azerbaijan is Armenia, which says it opened fire for the first time.  gt; ? Proof, Armenia technically already won the since they captured the lands in the 90s. They don't want more land they have no need to start new battles. Azerbaijan on the other hand wants to take back the lands etc. If they do not want more land, why do they hold 7 regions except Karabakh?  gt; It's not about the age you asked if OSCE requested ceasefire footage, I said they have asked for there to be ceasefire violation detector machines. This still does not confirm that Azerbaijan started the war.</TEXT>
