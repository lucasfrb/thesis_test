    <TITLE>Holy cow, I've just started watching this show!</TITLE>
    <DATE>2019-10-26 20:23:42</DATE>
    <TEXT>And it's crazy!  #128514; I don't watch a lot of trashy/reality TV but my one guilty pleasure was Catfish. This was suggested to me when I needed something in between Catfish seasons. I'm only on episode 3 but impressions so far: Russ  amp; Paola - I like Paola but she's definitely using Russ. I think she does like him but she's there for the lifestyle! I feel for her a little bit with his family and friends being so religious and conservative. His family in particular look like they could suck the fun out of any room! Also, at the beginning I would've sworn blind that Russ was gay. They're at it like bunnies though so he's possibly as deep in that closest as it's possible to get. Or he's bi, and only half of him is in that closet. Louis  amp; Aya - she's nice, he's an utter slob who I can't imagine making an effort with anything. His ex-wife is an utter bitch. Run Aya!! Mike  amp; Aziza - she's using him. 100%. He's a gullible idiot but he's seriously punching and it makes him look a little pathetic. I don't blame her for not sleeping with him, he's creepy! Alan  amp; Kirlyam - she's very sweet and I think does love him. He is ultra religious and already shows signs of being insanely jealous, possessive, controlling and insecure. What could possibly go wrong.</TEXT>

    <TITLE>S2 E2 first watch. Is Danielle really that deluded?</TITLE>
    <DATE>2019-10-28 11:24:53</DATE>
    <TEXT>She's sweet but does she really think a 26 year old, good looking guy is madly in love with her?? I see middle aged women like her in the newspapers here in the UK all the time. Usually they've been on holiday and met a hot guy half their age who "instantly" falls in love with them. They pay to bring him to the UK, get married then, shock, horror, suddenly he's either having affairs, spending their life savings or just disappears.  #128580; I'm the same age as Danielle and I just want to slap some sense into her!</TEXT>

    <TEXT>When I was a kid my grandmother introduced me to eating Weetabix sliced in half and buttered, rather than with with milk and sugar, like most people eat it. Real butter is obviously prefered but margarine can be used if necessary. Ever since this is the only way I've eaten it but I've never met anyone else who does and most people think I'm weird!</TEXT>

    <TEXT>A couple of weeks ago WoWprogress started not wanting to update my main character. I mostly keep it updated at the minute for the battle pet progress but it's suddenly replaced my main char in the progress list with an alt I hardly play, thinks my main only joined my guild this month (been there for 12 years) and even when updated isn't showing the latest pets I've collected or leveled. I tried to google but can't find any recent similar complaints. Does WoWProgress just not like me lol? Anyone had anything similar happen?</TEXT>

    <TITLE>I'm missing Wildstar badly. Can anyone recommend another MMO that has a good base/housing build type feature?</TITLE>
    <DATE>2020-05-20 15:43:43</DATE>
    <TEXT>So, I'm a regular WoW player but I was captivated by the housing in Wildstar (and pretty much the whole look of the game, to be honest) and it was my creative outlet whilst still being in a social mmorpg environment. Wildstar was just perfect. I loved the races, the zones, the stories. But it was the house building that really got me. The sheer level of customisation was insane, even from the start. I've tried to find something similar but I'm at a loss so any help appreciated! Thanks. Edit: Thanks for the great suggestions everyone! I have a few games to check out now.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Sooo . . . I want to get some mods that change the style of my farm buildings BUT I have several farms on the go and I want different "looks" for each of them. I'm not that clued up on mods but I'm not sure if this is possible or would I need separate copies of the game to do this?</TEXT>

    <TITLE>Looking for advice on flushing.</TITLE>
    <DATE>2020-08-12 12:03:56</DATE>
    <TEXT>So, I'm just starting to research switching my plants to semi-hydro and one of the things I'm unsure about is flushing. I know you should do it weekly while the plant is adapting and growing it's new roots but what about long term, with established and big plants? One of my plants is a Strelitzia Reginae and she will get pretty large eventually. The idea of having to somehow flush such a big plant is a bit worrying! How do others deal with their large plants?</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Honestly, a dehumidifier is a solid investment. I had a lot of humidity and damp issues in my place and a dehumidifier sorted it. If you did want to go the cheapest route, [these portable units](https://smile.amazon.co.uk/dp/B00F1DNYPE/ref=cm_sw_r_cp_apa_i_ExWsFbB90HS3A) are really good. I have one in my boat and it works well. Keep in mind you do have to keep buying refills for it though.

    <TEXT>For anyone interested, this is [@ ashpinehouse](https://instagram.com/ashpinehouse?igshid=1516jcplbfu8m), an Airbnb outside Boston. It's a beautiful place with a lot of lovely rooms so I have no idea why THIS particular one gets shared over and over. The photographer is [Christopher Funk](https://instagram.com/cfunk44?igshid=10c0dzxqqqg3m). He has a very distinctive style and often puts up projector screens (with Netflix, Disney etc) as part of his photography sets.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>In small farm cottages in the UK it was historically common to come in via the kitchen at the end of the day, due to it usually having a stone floor/being easy to clean and then cleaning up there ready for dinner. No such thing as "boot rooms" etc. in small cottages. Outdoor shoes would commonly be kept by the kitchen door. Since this place is trying VERY hard to look English, I'm pretty sure that's the idea they were going with by having boots there.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I'm an Airbnb owner and I can confirm that hiring travel photographers is not uncommon, especially if you have a rural or upmarket place. They stay, they do photographs, video, social media posts and can be quite good exposure. Although, if I were to pay for something like that, I'd go with [@ dirtandglass](https://instagram.com/dirtandglass?igshid=1oee7vnp67odl). His photos are still staged BUT they seem so much more real and accessible than those of this photographer.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I'm a complete novice with SH so this is a major learning curve for me. So far, and completely unexpectedly, it's the succulents that seem to be taking to SH the best. Here's where I'm at on day 10: 1. Burro's Tail propagation. Three leaves placed on top of leca. Small reservoir of water with Superthrive. Tiny roots on all three prop leaves. One prop has two small budding leaves. 2. Kalanchoe Blossfeldiana. Old plant, has been cut right down several times in the past. In water with added Superthrive. Leaves are still a little droopy but it is absolutely FULL of baby water roots! 3. Neon Pothos cutting. Baby plant, had roots when I received it and it went straight into leca with Superthrive water. It seems neither happy nor sad. Roots look okay, cut one rotten one off. Doesn't seem to be any new water roots growing though. 4. Alsobia Dianthiflora. Propagation attempt via cuttings from my adult plant. Water with Superthrive. Cuttings are neither dying nor showing roots. Placed them back in clean leca for a further attempt. Pleased with the results so far. I'll be taking my Peace Lily out to check roots in a couple of days and I think I will attempt to switch my baby Strelitzia over to SH next.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Yep, student loans are silly in the UK. You don't even start to pay them off until you start earning a certain amount every month and the repayments are riduculously low. I worked with someone who had four years worth of university student loans and he paid something like  #163;20 or  #163;30 a month on them.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Good luck getting any of those things in a UK house. Our places are small and mostly always two floors. Edit: that said, this IS decent advice. My partner and I live in our forever home (we're in our 40's), which we're currently renovating. It's pretty small BUT we're turning one of the downstairs rooms into a guest bedroom. The upstairs loft will be our bedroom suite but we have the peace of mind of knowing we have a downstairs bedroom if either of us need that.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>This sub isn't *really* for rating, it's for showing off your space and/or asking for constructive advice. We **like** to help here so, if you're actually asking for advice, it's much more helpful if we can see more of the room, not just a small portion of wall. Still, assuming you're legit and not trolling us, I'll give my two cents worth. 1. The wall colour is pretty bad. It makes it look old, scruffy and, quite frankly, nicotine-stained. Please change it. White, light grey, or even a feature wall in a more bold colour. 2. The pictures don't match as they are very different styles of art. Your space will look much more put together if you find a style or theme of art you like and stick to it. 3. It might be the angle, but the picture doesn't look centered over the TV. Fix that if you can. 4. The models under the TV. Just no. Collections are great but they can look crazy cluttered if they aren't displayed correctly. You want some nice shelves or even a display cabinet.</TEXT>

I follow a ton of home decor accounts (if you tell me what style you like, I can probably suggest some good ones). 4. Pinterest. This is probably the big one for me. I'm about to start a full house renovation and extension. Something that we've been planning for over a year.

    <TEXT>He was a phenomenal actor and a massively popular teen idol. I had posters of him on my bedrooms walls and I bawled my eyes out when he died. His life was a bit of a [rollercoaster ride](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/River_Phoenix), unfortunately. Hippies, sex cults, busking, drugs.</TEXT>

It's bad enough that guys make comments about pink setups, we don't need other women doing it too. To answer your question though, if you actually took the time to look through this sub you'd see a variety of colours and styles in gaming setups. This sort of "all girls" comment irritates the hell out of me tbh, and seeing it in this sub isn't nice.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Oh I did look and meme account means nothing, it's just an excuse horrible people use to get away with sharing or saying controversial things. Does it make you feel all edgy and cool? Disguising the use of despicable people or acts under the "lol jk" banner does not make it okay. Edit: a longer deep dive into your profile (shudder) suggests you are *severely* messed in the head and could really do with some therapy. And I mean that sincerely. I have no idea what you look like but you seem ugly on the inside and that's a choice, you don't have to be. Looks don't stop people from having relationships (plenty of ugly people are happily in love) but women can sense a porn/anime addicted mess from a mile away.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I definitely second the World of Warcraft idea! Most cities (Stormwind, the human city, especially) have lots of great bars and pubs where you can buy drinks, sit down, dance and generally have a good time. Plenty of Halloween fun goes on too. AND *(although* ***PLEASE*** *check this because I'm not entirely sure if trial accounts can access it*) if you time it with the Darkmoon Faire being up (first Sunday of the month for one week) you'd have access (from human and tauren starting areas) to a whole fun fair with a roller coaster, zoo, rides, and all sorts of faireground attractions and games. If you're in the EU, I'd be more than happy to help out (with booze, games etc.). :)</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I was very much a "not like other girls" growing up, and probably into my 20's, but I honestly don't think it had anything to do with misogyny. I grew up in a neighbourhood full of boys. I was one of them. BMX's, video games, building dens, all of it. They never treated me different and I never heard them speak down to or about other girls, in fact they often asked me advice on how to talk to girls they liked. Parents were cool. No boy or girl definitions on toys. I had barbies, action figures, trainsets, toy cars and dolls. Later on I went to an all-girls high school. That's where I realised that realised that everything I loved wasn't the "norm" and that I had no interest in clothes or makeup or any of the things that everyone else seemed to love. I made a couple of friends and it was a very inclusive environment but I was still the weird one, the geek. I thought I was the only one, because I never met any other girls like me. It's really only been as an adult that I've found other women who are geeks and gamers like me. I've also realised that I can be a geeky gamer AND still be girly. TL;DR: I think a lot of the "not like other girls" comes not from misogyny, but from having not yet found "your people".</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Believe me, the mods have been petitioned, begged and pleaded with. For months. A bunch of us tried messaging them, over and over, asking them to either hand over the sub or take on some active mods. Nothing. I even tried to get forced control of the sub but, because the mods do occassionally post elsewhere on Reddit, I wasn't able to. We gave up in the end and went off and created r/CozierPlaces as a "replacement" sub. It shouldn't have been neccesary but it was. Last week someone DID finally get a reply off a mod, who admitted he isn't fussed about policing the sub and is happy for it to run itself.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I laughed WAY to hard at that last one! In my mind, the issue is less about gender roles and more freedom of choice. My partner supports whatever I'd choose. He was happy when I had a career but he was happily supportive when I wanted to rely on some passive income to leave my job to stay home and homeschool our daughter. Turns out, I loved being at home so I never went back to work. I get to have all day doggy cuddles, keep the house tidy(ish), cook (which I love) and baby my houseplants. It's all about the freedom to choose and having that choice respected.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>In the UK, that wall colour is called ["Magnolia"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magnolia_(color)) and everything (from rentals to new builds) is painted in it because it's considered warmer than white. It's universally hated though and I wouldn't be caught dead painting one of my places in it.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I definitely see where you are coming from but there's also an argument for just being able to make your space somewhere fun. For example, I'm just starting to renovate my home. I know interior design, I know the "rules" and I'll be breaking rather a lot of them. Themed rooms, for example, are a nono yet I'm planning to turn one of my bathrooms into the inside of a spaceship. Tacky? Maybe. Fun? Definitely. I think I've just reached the point in life where I worry very little what other people think and I'm using that as an excuse to go off the tracks a little, creativity speaking. The best advice I've ever seen was, surprisingly, by an interior designer, who said "if you love it, it works". I think there's a lot of truth there.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I don't really agree with this. Or, at least, it's not going to be the correct advice for everyone. For example, someone completely sedentary and living on junk food, yes, this approach will work initially. On the other hand, using myself as an example, I didn't exercise much but my diet wasn't awful. I knew how to eat healthy and I've always cooked from scratch but my portion sizes were out of control. I was never really able to gage *how much* I needed to eat. I *needed* to measure and weigh my food to bring that under control. Counting calories is the absolute best thing I've ever done. It's easy, it's sustainable long term and, I'm sorry, but it's **plenty** healthy. 1600 calories a day gives me room to eat healthy meals and have the odd treat and still lose weight. I don't feel deprived, I feel in control.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I absolutely agree with this advice! I (F) started weight lifting two months ago, at the same time as I started cutting calories to lose fat. For the first six weeks the scale didn't more as I reaped all the "beginner gains". Now the scale is moving but I also have visible muscle. The reality of this is that I know I'd look a lot better a lot faster than I would if I waited to the end before lifting.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>It's extremely likely that you are building muscle. Muscle is denser than fat so often losing body fat while gaining muscle results in the scale not moving but measurements will go down. I started exercising just over two months ago (with weights) and the scale didn't move for at least the first six or seven weeks. Once that initial muscle gain slows, the scale will start moving. Also, don't discount counting calories. Many people vastly over or under estimate how much they are eating. You need to know for sure. Get an app like MyFitnessPal and log everything you'd eat on a day where you are just eating what you want to eat (not worrying about portions etc.). Do that for a week and then you have an average daily calorie count. Now take around 300 off of that but never go below 1200 at the absolute lowest. As an example I'm on 1600 and still losing weight. Calories don't have to be super low.</TEXT>

    <TITLE>Some questions about haworthia seedlings.</TITLE>
    <DATE>2020-09-21 13:44:48</DATE>
    <TEXT>I have a handfull of baby haws that I've grown from seed. They are maybe a few months old now (they all have a third leaf growing). They are currently a bit less than 1cm tall, in small seedling pots, in a very gritty mix and getting watered about once a week after completely drying out. Currently sitting on a very bright windowstill but slightly protected from direct sun. I just wanted to check if I'm doing it right or if there is anything else I need to be doing? They were getting a lot of direct sun until recently but I think they were getting a bit of sun stress so I've shaded them slightly. Should I be leaving them in their seedling pots for a while? What sort of age/size can they be moved to more permanent pots? Any advice appreciated!</TEXT>

    <TEXT>More info: My dad was in the merchant navy for many years and loved everything to do with ships and the sea. He built this home bar from scratch. The bar counter is completely hand-built, each beer bottle was placed individually and some had lights in them. All the memorabilia was collected by him over many years. The ships wheel in the second picture is authentic and was fitted to a bearing in the wall so it could actually be turned. The large picture on the wall (HMS Victory in Portsmouth harbour) is a rare print of an etching and the only one of it's size in the world as my dad knew the person who owned the original and gained his permission to make a print of it. My parents had many many house parties in this bar!</TEXT>

And the bonus of it being a very small country is that you can live outside of a city, pay a decent rent and still easily commute into the city for work. I rent out a couple of properties in a small town that's in easy commuting distance of the nearest city, and even London at a push and the rent for the one bedroom apartment is  #163;550 a month.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>In all fairness, some of the people with nice setups might have saved for years to get to that point. I think it's a little harsh to call it bragging when they are just proud and happy. Using myself as an example, I'm not rich but gaming is my only big hobby so I *do* sink a lot of money into it. I'd be pretty upset if I posted my setup here and people told me I was bragging. I also don't think that people who DO have money should be shamed for it. I moderate a couple of subs and I see so much hate directed to anyone who is clearly well-off and I just don't get why. It's jealousy I guess but surely it's nicer to just be happy for people.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I just wanted to chip in to say that I was also unable to get a rescue dog and it wasn't for lack of trying. We were desperate for a family dog. We wanted either a sweet lapdog or a calm, gentle medium breed. Had to be a healthy breed, so no Frenchies, Cavaliers etc. We did not want to have to deal with a dog with trauma, super high energy or behaviour problems. The first issue we had was that all the rescues near us were full of staffies, huskies and lurchers. Any dog remotely fitting what we looked for was often on a waiting list and reserved instantly. The second problem we had was that we had cats and rabbits. That made rescue staff nervous and none of the dogs that "may" have been suitable were breeds that we wanted. Third issue was that our garden is open to a river and is "fenced" along one side by a dock. That was an immediate rejection by rescue centers, it turns out. We only now have a dog because we rehomed a beautiful golden retriever from friends who were emigrating. Our next dog will have to be from a breeder, out of necessity, but you can bet your life that we will spend *months* researching breeds and breeders first.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I bought a rooted neon pothos cutting and put it straight in leca just over a month ago. Only one leaf and a few roots. It seemed to take a bit longer to adjust than some of my older, more mature plants (none of which are pothos though, to be fair). Checked it yesterday and it's finally getting some water roots and what looks like the start of a new leaf.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>When I sterilise my leca, I put in a mixing bowl and pour boiling water from the kettle over it. The bowls just get rinsed and then go through a hot dishwasher cycle afterwards. Boiling it in pots, I'd honestly be more worried about it ruining the non-stick than anything else. I'm pretty sure that a thorough clean and maybe a session of just boiling plain water in it to completely sterilise it would be fine.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I bought a baby Strelitzia Reginae just under a month ago and put her straight into leca. I was somewhat unprepared for the roots, which were like multiple tap roots. The pot I put her in was probably a little too shallow and the roots were only a fraction above the water line. She took to SH very quickly (second picture is the first root check after two weeks) and now, three weeks in, the roots are well into the water and growing out the side of the pot (first pic). I'm having some serious trouble finding a tall deep pot. I do have a pot that's quite a bit wider and a few cm taller. The roots would still be in the water but she's clearly happy with that and there would be more space for the roots to go sideways. Worth repotting her into that or should I keep looking for a tall/deep container?</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Most narrow boats (at least the ones I've seen) have an entrance at both the bow and the stern. They are steered from the stern and that's generally where the "main" entrance is (usually leading into the main living space). The bedroom is typically at the bow, as I assume this one is, so that's unlikely to be the main entrance.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Out of all my plants, my pothos has been the slowest to take to the leca. It's a young plant too, a well rooted cutting. It's finally decided it's happyish and is sending out some water roots and a new leaf but it's taken double the time of all my other plants.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I have a couple of plants that will grow into big specimen plants (like my Strelitiza). So far I've been happiest with having my plants and leca in a clear orchid type pot (which I then sit in a pretty catch pot), but the orchid pots are only available up to a certain size. Then I struck gold and I found these [clear buckets](https://www.ebay.co.uk/itm/Small-Large-Clear-Plastic-Bucket-With-Lid-Carry-Handle-Storage-Container-Box-Bin/252520492623?ssPageName=STRK%3AMEBIDX%3AIT amp;var=551421097566 amp;_trksid=p2057872.m2749.l2649). You get them in ALL different sizes and they appear to be perfect for big house plants. Just take the lid and handle off. I've just bought one for my Strelitzia. I have two choices now. I can put some holes a third of the way up and just keep it like that or I can try to find a large, pretty catch pot to sit it in.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I have an elderly, long-haired, VERY fluffy, very *white* cat who sometimes suffers from an iffy stomach and isn't able to clean the resulting mess on his fur so he often needs a quick bath. Luckily for us, he's an absolute sweetheart and allows us to just hold him and soak his bum in warm water, without even a hint of annoyance. We dry him well and keep him in a warm room afterwards. If we tried that with our other cat, however, we'd probably lose our faces and most likely some limbs as well.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>High school was almost 30 years ago for me and I struggled through it all (undiagnosed ADD). Passed high school but no where near the grades needed for university. My dreams of becoming a paleontologist sunk, I ended up taking a course in desktop publishing, print and graphic design. It wasn't my first choice but it was okay and it was a six month course that gave me a twenty year career in various print shops, design agencies and newspapers, with a decent salary, so I can't really complain. Any success beyond that is just circumstance. I lost both my parents when I was in my 30s and inherited a large amount of money and several properties. I'd already left my job to look after my mom at that point so I went from being a graphic designer to being a landlord. My current passion is the renovation of an A-frame cabin that was my family's holiday home. I'm planning to turn it into a luxury Airbnb. Future plans are to hopefully add to my property portfolio, maybe with a second Airbnb too, so my partner can retire early from his job and we can do some traveling.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Yep I agree, that quote is very much "anti design". I've always felt very strongly that a home should be created around, and *for*, the people that live there. So many interiors seem to be done to impress *others,* with the needs of the people actually living there coming in second. So yes, "if you love it, it works for you" and, unless you have a need for others' approval, that's all that matters.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I was given it as a gift so it was flowering at that point. I had two others so I knew they were tricky and that everywhere just says throw it away as it's a "forced flowing" plant. Couldn't bear to do that so I trimmed it down a bit to stop it getting leggy and left it on a south facing windowsill, letting it dry out between waterings. The following winter she re-flowered. My other two never did though, so maybe an element of luck there. I've actually just converted all my plants to semi-hydro and, surprisingly, it's this Kalanchoe that's taken to it the fastest and is thriving. I'm a little worried I may have messed up her flowering cycle with such a drastic lifestyle change but we'll see what happens.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>To add to some of the other comments here, it's also feeling like, as a woman, that any choice you make is the wrong one. If you're career focused you're a hard-nosed bitch destroying traditional family values, if you choose to be a stay at home mom you're lazy, a gold-digger and a leech. If you have an active sex life you're a hoe, if you don't have sex you're frigid. Wear provocative clothes and you're a slut, dress more demurely and you're frumpy. And so on. Patriarchy takes away the freedom to choose without judgement, for both men and women. Sometimes, especially for kids, it's even worse for guys as they will get teased and bullied horribly for liking sometime vaguely "girly", whereas girls being a "tomboy" is more acceptable. When a guy can take his kids out for the day without being asked if he's "babysitting" to give their mom a break, when a woman can go online to play video games and not be told to go back to the kichen or get rape threats (r/girlgamers could tell you all about that) then we'll be getting somewhere.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>It's basically semi-hydroponics. Orginally used for orchids, it's been discovered that most house plants do really well in it. You use a clay aggregate (LECA) and the pot stands in water that contains a high quality hydroponic fertilizer. There is a bit of a transition period as the plant has to grow water roots in order to survive in the new environment and different plants can take varying times to do this. It's a bit of a faff to start with but long term it's easier than soil and the best thing is absolutely no fungus gnats, as they need soil to live in. If you're interested r/SemiHydro has a lot of info.</TEXT>

If you're in a very hot place, you might need to be a bit more careful. At the time I took this pic, she was in succulent soil mix with added perlite. I usually let her dry out quite a bit before watering, waiting until her leaves got a little squishy, then I'd put her in the sink and soak her.</TEXT>
