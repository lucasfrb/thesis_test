    <TEXT>For me, I really have two frontmen that I can't pick between with the funny part being they are nothing alike. One would be KISS' Paul Stanley. IMHO, he is the epitome of what a frontman should be. Unfortunately KISS along with Paul's ability have decreased severely over the past few years. Second would be Pearl Jam's Eddie Vedder. He sings with complete passion and (in his younger days) was so energetic. Oh, and I do love Jack White as well. I also have to give big honorable mentions to David Byrne, Bono and Ol' Blue Eyes, Frank Sinatra. Frontwoman would easily go to Shirley Manson from Garbage. I just love her voice and she comes off so genuine. One of my favorite bands, period.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I have probably around 30 or so that I consider favorites. They comprise a pretty eclectic range from KISS to Sinatra to Blue Man Group. Whenever I actually sit down to really listen to music, I usually do so on vinyl or at the very least CD. But generally I just play from my computer's hard drive through my home theater setup. I only bring this up because when I play my music in this fashion, I do so randomly from a few hundred different artist that are on the drive. Point being, I regularly listen to hundreds of different artists. Anyway, my top 30 or so in no real order would be... Pearl Jam Garbage KISS Talking Heads Blue Man Group Jimi Hendrix Pink Floyd Sixx: A.M. Frank Sinatra U2 Billy Joel Guns N' Roses Men at Work White Stripes Fleetwood Mac Led Zeppelin Amy Winehouse Venus Hum CCR Snoop Dogg Eminem Lady Gaga Dream Theater Adam and the Ants Pretenders Chris Botti Hugh Laurie Dean Martin Motley Crue I could easily go on and have very likely forgotten to mention quite a few. It also goes that I consider former members of many of these acts as favorites. Artists like Ace Frehley, Bruce Kulick, Slash and Jack White.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I've been a huge fan since I was 11 way back in 1977. That said, I see each trilogy for what it is and I am brutally honest in saying there is very good  amp; very bad within each one. If I were to list my top three (Skywalker) films, I would have to say none of the three trilogies would have more than one entry. In all honesty, even as someone who seen A New Hope in 1977 and grew up on Star Wars, I can honestly say the OT contains my favorite episode as well as one of my absolute least favorites. I guess what I'm saying is that the theory that someone automatically loves or even likes the trilogy of their childhood the best does not hold true for me. I don't love every film of every trilogy nor do I dislike any trilogy as a whole. It's one bigger story with highs and lows scattered throughout.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>First a very quick introduction. I've been into home theater since the very early 90's and have had several systems. I'm no audio engineer but I know and understand all the terminology, so no need to over explain things. Anyway, I currently have a Yamaha RX-A780 receiver that's powering Polk Audio RTi A7 towers up front. At least that's the gear important to my issue. I'm running the Polks bi-amped. No matter what I do or how I tweak the settings it seems I have to crank the volume up a lot farther than I think I should have to in order to get even moderate levels. Are these speakers that power hungry or maybe I'm overlooking something in the menu? Any thoughts would be appreciated.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>The 900 series is more for gaming as it has VRR with LFC which compensates for gaming's changing framerates. The 950 series does not have this feature. That said, the 950 is an overall better display. I'm looking to replace the Samsung we currently have and am having kinda the same dilemma as you. The difference is I am an avid gamer but I'm not sure whether to prioritize VRR with LFC or an overall better picture. Honestly, the only time any framerate compensation will likely come into play is with older, lower framerate titles. For you as someone who is not a gamer... Go with the 950 series. Even as a gamer, I'll probably do the same.</TEXT>

Anyway, players are so cheap you might as well grab a 4k machine. By the time you do move beyond 1080p your choices will likely be a lot worse than they are now. Just a thought... How about using a game console as your player? The Xbox One X is a very capable player. It will play 4k discs and you'll always have the option to shoot zombies!</TEXT>

    <TEXT>The volume seems low all the time, whether I'm running stereo or all channels. Before I was running the A7s I was using A4 bookshelves which played louder at lower volumes. No, I wasn't expecting any real volume difference by bi-amping them. It was simply recommended by several people because the A7s are power hungry. I should also note that I've connected these speakers to two other receivers, an older Aventage and an Onkyo, both with the same result.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Thanks. I was thinking the problem was something along those lines. In all honesty. I'm more prepared to replace the speakers than the receiver. I was using the A4s as surrounds but due to room specifics, running wired speakers to the back is fairly unacceptable so I'm now using a set of Music Cast wireless speakers. That was the main reason in buying the Yamaha. I'm thinking about going with a Klipsch setup for the front three and keeping the Music Casts for the rear. The klipsch speakers I'm looking at are rated at 98db sensitivity.</TEXT>

That said, IMO it only contains one great episode (III) while the other two range from the worst episode of them all to just mediocre. I can't argue against The Clone Wars as that is some of the best writing in all of Star Wars.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Sorry but I see a lot of the exact same hypocrisy going on among "fans" now as i did when the PT came out. Every criticism of the current trilogy can be said of both the OT  amp; PT. I am definitely a hard core fan and have been since I was 11 years old back in 1977. Every trilogy has at least one great episode and every trilogy has one bad one. If you want my honest opinion, the ST has less low points than either of the previous Skywalker trilogies. I know this is an unpopular opinion but I'd take The Last Jedi over The Phantom Menace and the first 2/3 of Return of the Jedi any day. Everybody whines about what Rian Johnson did to Luke Skywalker. I call BS. Rian finally made Luke a believable and honest character. Anyone who couldn't see him becoming what he was in TLJ is looking with their blast shields down. Luke's character development in that film won me over MORE than the Luke/Vader/Palpatine sequence did for the Muppet, Teddy Bear riddled RotJ. My only issue with TRoS is how it retconned and/or ignored most of TLJ.</TEXT>

    <TITLE>Opinions on bi-amping wanted</TITLE>
    <DATE>2020-07-15 02:58:54</DATE>
    <TEXT>Hello all, I just ordered a set of Klipsch RP-280F towers along with a matching center. I am replacing a Polk setup in which I was running RTi-A7 towers. The Polks were very power hungry with a sensitivity rating of 89db. I had them bi-amped to try and compensate for the fact that I had to push my Yamaha RX-A780 to get even moderate volumes levels. The Klipsch speakers that are on the way have a sensitivity rating of 98db and (from what I've been told) require much less power overall. My question is should I simply unplug the bi-amped wiring from the Polks and insert it all into the Klipsches or would I be better off using only two channels of the receiver's power to drive the new speakers? Any suggestions along with pros  amp; cons would be appreciated.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>No placebo effect here as bi-amping produced no results even though I was told it would. The problem is that I've tried the A7s on different receivers as well as different speakers on the receiver in question all with the same result... The A7s need to be turned to a higher volume setting to get a comparable level. I'd been advised before buying the A7s that they require more power than their 89db rating suggests. Even my A4 bookshelf speakers were noticeably louder at the same setting. In other words, the low output issue followed the A7s, so I have replaced them. I realize not all speakers will or even should play at the same level as another but the A7s in my case had trouble attaining moderate levels regardless of configuration or power source. I'm sure a higher end, higher powered amp would have solved the problem but I opted to replace the speakers rather than the receiver. Anyway, how loud the Klipsch speakers will reproduce bass is of little concern as I'm using a separate sub. Even (as you state) at 5db less, that's still better than the 89db of the Polks. Besides, I know the RP-280Fs produce terrific bass. My question is more of a generic one. Am I better off (on the speaker side) bi-amping or (on the receiver side) letting it supply power with two channels rather than the four needed to bi-amp?</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Thanks. Yes, I have a sub. It's a PSW12 that I purchased years ago with the A4s. I feel I'm definitely lacking the power to drive the A7s properly which is why I'm replacing them. As I said, I was told (by a few people) that they required more power than one would expect. My receiver is newer than the speakers and I've also invested in Music Cast surrounds which are useless without the Yamaha. It's really not a big deal to have to turn the volume knob a little higher. I just don't want to overwork the receiver to get simply adequate levels. I just won't bother bi-amping the Klipsch speakers. As I said, I only did so with the Polks because people advised me to, which as I also said, didn't work. That's pretty much why I posted here.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Short answer: Maybe, maybe not. It depends on the content, it's mastering, the production. The quality of the pressing, etc, etc. Analog is at face value better than digital because of its constantly variable nature. There are no gaps in the sound making it fuller and closer to natural. That said, analog media and gear has issues that (depending on you personal preference) can negate analog's big advantage. Vinyl comes with pops and a smaller dynamic range. Do you prefer a fuller sound or one free of static with more range? Even then, the recording on a record may have been recorded digitally to begin with, again negating analog's no gap advantage. From recording to manufacturing to the gear itself, analog has a more strict road to travel to sound really good. When it does, it does but that is unfortunately not often. It's easier and more common to get a CD that sounds great than something on vinyl.</TEXT>

When your TV is calibrated to 6500k it will or at least should match what the film maker intended because the film was mastered at 6500k. That doesn't mean things will look natural as the film maker may have wanted an orange tint for example. In other words, at 6500k the film maker cranked the orange up a bit. So if calibrated to 6500k the picture on your TV will look orange.The settings on your TV are somewhat dependent on room color, lighting and such. Having your walls painted close to 6500k will help get you a correct picture. This is of course (as I said) REAL nerdy. Anyway, 6500k is basically neutral. Not yellowish (warm) or blueish (cool). Pure white would be considered 6500k as would a perfectly neutral grey. How dark or light doesn't matter so long as the color itself isn't warm or cool.</TEXT>

For me, the best reasons for owning the PS4 are Persona 5 and the FFVII Remake (which isn't as good as the original). I used to be a huge Gran Turismo fan but there is no proper GT game on the PS4 and Sport kinda sucks. Then again, GT has been going downhill since the PS2 installments. I will definitely be buying the Series X first.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Personally, I think the OG Playstation had the best library of games. One of the top two overall libraries of all time. PS games have gotten less creative, safer and more westernized since then. I haven't "loved" any overall library since the Dreamcast. Of the exclusives, I just prefer what Xbox has.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Yeah I'm a lot older than you. My Son has 10 years on you! I've been a gamer since home video games have existed. IMO games continued getting better until the PS2 era. Yeah, they're prettier now but the creativity just isn't there. There used to be a lot more variety too. Now there's a small handful of dominant genres with many of them sharing similar gameplay. Basically there's a lot of following and not a lot of innovation. Today's games also lead the player by the hand too much, but I'm ranting now. As far as next generation goes, Sony seems vague and hasn't really shown much. It seems to me that a lot of what they're doing lately is remastering games that aren't that old and don't need remastering. Did Last of Us REALLY need a PS4 makeover?</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Newer games that are good are extremely good. The problem is with overall libraries which are crammed with cookie cutter titles and little individuality. Better graphics don't necessarily mean a better game. If they did why has the Final Fantasy series (as one example) been such a disappointment since the OG Playstation generation ended? Devs rely on graphics to give the illusion that games are better than they are. I'll take innovative, interesting gameplay over graphics any day. I'm not saying better graphics automatically mean a worse game because that's not the case. It's just that as gaming has gotten bigger, devs are catering to a larger audience that requires a more dumbed-down style of gameplay. The graphics aren't at fault, they just happen to be better now than when games were actually creative and innovative.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>You are absolutely correct. I love better graphics but I love great gameplay more. Gameplay is where today's games lack. Let me clarify that... it's not that today's gameplay is necessarily bad, it's more that so many games are so similar. There's just no variety. At least not like there used to be. More genres used to be a lot more well represented and many genres (today) are combing so many of the same elements that everything is starting to look and play the same. The fact that much of Sony and Microsoft's libraries are shared has cut way down on innovation and variety. When the majority of a console's games were exclusive, it bred rivalry and innovation. There isn't much of that anymore. If someone owned two different consoles, that player had access to two totally different libraries of games. Owning two consoles now gives players access to two libraries that are 90% the same. That's a big issue as it comes to variety.</TEXT>

Any surges as the power is lost or as it returns would be more likely to damage your gear. I've got all of our equipment connected to a really good power conditioner rather than a simple surge protector. Even if you never lose power, constant dirty or fluctuating power can be even worse.

    <TEXT>The TV doesn't matter so much. If it's just 1080p the player will only output a 1080p signal. Besides, flat panel TVs are fixed pixel displays and regardless of what resolution is pumped into them, they are only really capable of displaying at their native resolution. That said, a 4k disc will not play in any player that's below 4k capable. As far as Xbox goes, you'll need an S or an X model. Keep in mind that without the TV you're not gonna get 4k. Also remember that even with the TV, the Xbox One S will not play games in 4k. It only plays video at 4k. To game in 4k you'll need a One X and a 4k TV.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>In the late 80's I had an extremely close encounter (within 25ft) with a V shaped UFO. About a week later I woke up out of a dead sleep to see multi-colored twinkling lights near the corner of the room. I also seen a shadow move toward me from the side. At that point, the next thing I remember was waking up the next day to all of the (digital) clocks flashing 3:00... Not 12:00, but 3:00 which I found really strange. Anyway, yes I have definitely seen colored lights inside the room.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>If at all possible, you want the same speakers all the way around. Soundwise nothing breaks the illusion worse than the sound sounding different from one area or another. It's like having half of your TV screen a different color. That said, you can get away with it front to rear. So long as your center matches you should be good. And stay away from Bose. Probably the most overpriced, cheaply made garbage on the market.</TEXT>

Rears that sound drastically different from the front can ruin otherwise great sound even if they are excellent speakers on their own.

    <TEXT>It made perfect sense. Once learning how political the Jedi had become, how easily they were manipulated and how they'd fallen to the point they couldn't even detect a Sith Lord in the same room... Please. He also knew that bringing balance... TRUE BALANCE meant embracing both sides of the Force rather than continuing the constant conflict between the two sides if the same coin. True balance required a new grey order of Force users. Yes it was time for the Jedi to end. That's exactly why the so called balance achieved at the end of RotJ didn't last. Anyone who looked at the situation realistically could easily predict that the TLJ version of Luke is exactly what he would have become.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Basically gaming TVs will have VRR (Variable Refresh Rate), LFC (Low Framerate Compensation) and HDMI 2.1 as a bare minimum. These are features (VRR  amp; LFC) that are important for gaming but not so much for anything else. In fact some manufacturers don't include VRR  amp; LFC on higher end models that offer better picture quality. The Sony 900H is a good example. It has VRR while the more expensive 950H with a superior picture does not.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>There's still a risk of burn-in. It is inherent of OLED and there's NOTHING that can be done to eliminate the possibility. Maybe you don't have burn-in but that does not make OLED displays a particularly good choice for gaming, especially if you're a hard core gamer who will end up playing marathon sessions of the same game. Besides, I've had several people (plasma  amp; OLED users) claim their displays had zero burn-in. Guess what? Almost all of them did. I'm not saying you do but I am saying your OLED is NOT immune to it. If you think it is, you're only fooling yourself. There's a reason why you almost never see OLED gaming displays. There's also a reason why OLED warranties explicitly DO NOT cover burn-in.</TEXT>

If you're a casual gamer or one that will only play one game for short periods of time, you can probably get away with it. I am a hard core gamer and I could not play with any piece of mind on an OLED. I'm just giving advice to those who know little about the technologies.</TEXT>

I'm not saying that in a bad way, they're just not up there with dedicated audio manufacturers.

    <TEXT>Yes, November has been confirmed. MS is actually stating November in new promo material. Anyway, I own an OG One, an S and two X consoles. Of the three models the S is my least favorite. Game wise it's not really any better than the OG and it's leagues behind the X. It's also not as stable as the OG. If you want a One, the X is the only way to go. Unfortunately MS has discontinued the X, so if you find one you're gonna pay through the nose for it. I would personally wait for the Series X.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Personally, I couldn't give a crap less about achievements so I pay no attention to them at all. That said, I did 100% Test Drive Unlimited on the 360. Yeah, it felt good but not enough to make me care about achievements or gamerscore. If I open them up while enjoying the game... Great but that's about where it ends for me. Had they followed through with the original idea of them opening special stuff like avatar gear and in-game items i might feel differently but as-is I really could not care less.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Sorry but the games themselves are subjective and open to personal taste  amp; opinion. I have both and while the vast majority of their libraries are identical, someone could easily prefer the Xbox exclusives to those of the Plagitation. As of right now I'll take the Xbox over the Playstation just for Forza and PSO2. I also prefer the Xbox controller over that of the PS4 by a gigantic margin. The One X is also far more powerful than the PS4 Pro which is more akin to the One S. Of the current machines only the One X actually plays games at 4k. The PS4 Pro and One S only play and stream video at 4k. I own three Xbox One consoles and two PS4s and have not had an issue with any of them. SERIES X GAMES DO NOT PLAY ON THE XBOX ONE! Xbox One games will play on Series X. But yes, buy both if possible. All that said, might as well wait for Series X  amp; PS5 at this point.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Um, Kallax from Ikea. That said, if you don't have an Ikea close or don't want to pay $100 shipping for a $40 item (seriously)... Go for the Better Homes and Gardens version. It's pretty much identical and is easier to obtain via Amazon or Walmart. The BH amp;G units are usually a bit more expensive (by a couple bucks) but come in more colors. Kallax has far more accessories and shipping for them is within reason. They're interchangeable. Like I said the Ikea and BH amp;G units are basically identical.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I hadn't heard that. So the Series X is basically a higher powered One? What's the point of a new generation if the games play on the old machines? Just call it what it is, a One X Plus. Actually that makes no sense. Why would MS offer to upgrade an Xbox One version of a game to a Series X version if the same version would simply look better on the Series X. They are obviously different versions. If the superior version plays on the old machine there is no reason to have two versions.</TEXT>

Ten is easily one of my top five albums of all-time. Yes The Beatles are one of the greatest and most influential bands ever. I'm just not personally a huge fan. They definitely belong on any Who's the Best Ever list. Not my style but I do recognize. Queen is good. I don't not like them but I don't truly like them either. I can take them or leave them. Freddy was a good front man but again, I done think he's the greatest ever. Top ten? Sure, but not #1. Not for me anyway.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I just never understood being in one "camp" or the other. We're gamers not company spokespeople. As a gamer I want access to all games. The consoles are just the tools we use to play. The whole Console X Vs. Console Y mentality is kinda childish. I personally prefer the Xbox platform but that doesn't mean I don't or can't have a Playstation. If I had only an Xbox I couldn't play something like Persona 5 or GT Sport. It's more important to me that I'm playing those titles than being able to say I'm an Xbox guy. That said, the rumors that the Series X will be more powerful than the PS5 are not rumors. The specs have been released and it is absolutely more powerful just as the One X was more powerful than the PS4 Pro. To be honest... Who cares? I'm more concerned with the exclusive games, the online structure and the controller than a set of specs that aren't that far apart.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Yeah, this makes no sense to me. Why buy a next gen machine when it's games can be played on the old machine? MS is trying to turn consoles into PCs. One of the main features of a console is that everyone's machine is the same. One person's game will play the same as the next guys and the next and the next. Now how a game looks and plays will be dependent on the machine that person has. That's a PC thing, not a console thing. One player is on a One S while the other is on the Series X. The player on the Series X is going to have faster loading, clearer visuals, etc. With Xbox, MS is taking the even playing field away. I'm truly not liking this.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>First, it's a Sony. Sony has the best color science and the most natural looking picture of any brand. As someone who's real hobby is home theater and has been for over 25 years, I can without hesitation say the best TVs are made by Sony. Second, it's got VRR (Variable Refresh Rate) which changes the framerate to match that of the game. This will eliminate screen tear. It will also eliminate stutter down to a certain point for games with lower framerates. Third, it's an LCD. I know OLED produces a superior picture but it is also susceptible to burn-in. The chances of it happening can be reduced by playing for shorter periods of time and avoiding games with bright, static images but the threat will always be there. For home theater I would recommend an OLED. For gaming I would avoid OLED. Fourth, the Sony X900H has been receiving rave reviews from both experts and consumers. I would have purchased one already but I opted for a new set of Klipsch towers.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Yes, it is 120hz with variable refresh rate. That means it will change framerates to match the game. If a game is running at 90fps, the TV will switch to 90. No more tearing and much less stutter.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Honestly, it's a cable. It's not a big investment. Just buy the highest spec one you can find. There's no such thing as overkill when it comes to your HDMI cable. The worst that will happen is that you'll have something better than you need. And do not buy super expensive HDMI cables unless you're getting really long runs (over 25ft.). Being digital, all they have to do is get a string of 0's  amp; 1's from one end to the other. They either work or they don't. The 0's  amp; 1's will still just be 0's  amp; 1's whether you paid $10 or $1,000 for the cable. Quality only really comes into play when the cable is extra long.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Yes, we need competition. In fact consoles would be better off reaching back a few generations when almost all of any console's library was exclusive games. There was more competition which produced better games and more variety. Without the competition of exclusives, Mario would not have led to Sonic and those two would not have led to Crash. We would have simply had Mario on all three. Today's multiplatform standard has led to a giant cookie cutter landscape of homogenized games. That said, the idea of players being loyal to one console or another is childish. I just want to play games. I don't give a crap about one console versus another. What we need is friendly rivalry rather than console wars and tons of multiplatform games.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>The problem with this poll is that Grunge was never really a type of music, it was a lifestyle kinda like the Hippies were in the 60's. What we think of as Grunge music was more of a sound or vibe that was indicative of bands from the Seattle area... Much like L.A. had a distinctive sound in the 80's. That Seattle sound came to be known as Grunge because of the trending Seattle lifestyle that was associated with the music of the era. Anyone who has ever listened to Pearl Jam and Alice in Chains knows they are two very different genres of music. They both have that Seattle vibe but one (AIC) is Metal while the other (PJ) is more of an eclectic mix of Classic Rock  amp; Folk. On the other hand a band like like Nirvana sounds more like a Seattle version of Alternative and a milder form of Punk. This poll is really apples to oranges to bananas.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Nice. I kinda collect controllers. The Wife  amp; I have somewhere around 20 including four from the Design Lab. They're much nicer than they look on the website. One word of warning... The color on the Shadow bodies will scratch off on hard edges. I learned this cleaning the gap between the face  amp; the back of my original Copper Shadow controller. Just show a little care  amp; you'll be fine. That said, I wish they had more button colors and I'd really like it if they had colors that correspond to the Xbox dashboard's background colors.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>It's really strange because I'm really organized and OCD when it comes to how things are arranged. My DVDs, Blu-rays, video games, CDs are all meticulously arranged in various ways depending on the media. That said, my vinyl is not arranged at all. When I get a new record I go through the process of opening it, pulling out the inner sleeve  amp; record then sliding them into a polypropylene sleeve behind the cover. After that I hand it to my Wife who slips it randomly among all the other records on one of the shelves. The funny part is I'm fine with it. I do not understand myself sometimes.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Wow, first time seeing Blade Runner. I am so jealous. Blade Runner is one of the greatest pieces of science fiction ever put on film (one of my top five films of all-time). It's also one of the darkest and more probable futures. Yeah we're already past the year in which the film is set but I can still see the world turning out like it is in Blade Runner. Here's a piece of little known trivia... Blade Runner is part of the same universe as Alien. Ridley Scott has even stated that the Wayland Utani building is in Blade Runner's Los Angeles. The Austin Powers movies are some of my favorite comedies ever. At first I didn't like Goldmember but as time went on it became my favorite of the three, by far.</TEXT>

It can upscale to 4k but that's not true 4k, it's blowing up 1440p to take up all the space in a 4k box. The difference between the Series S  amp; the Series X is relatively equal to the difference between the One S  amp; the One X. If the Series S were capable of 4k Microsoft would say so even if that claim stretched the truth a bit.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I agree. Whether I like a particular film is dependent on that film, how it fits into the overall story and how it compares to the other films. I don't see how Disney fucked anything up any more than any of the other films did. Some people may not like where the story went... Oh well. I don't have any problem with where the story went with the ST. In fact I think what Rian Johnson did with Luke was some of the absolute best and most realistic character development in the entire saga. Some people just can't get over the fact that it's not 1977 anymore, time moves on, characters evolve and the Star Wars universe as a whole didn't remain in a state of suspended animation since the events of Return of the Jedi. Some just can't get by the notion that everything in that universe doesn't revolve completely around Luke, Leia, Han and a few other characters.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Personally, I do not like this whole idea of differing performance levels. One of the defining features of consoles has always been that they are all the same. There's no compatibility issues and no-one has a better or worse experience when it comes to how their game plays. Now we're gonna have some players (online) who have the advantage of cleaner visuals and better overall performance. MS is getting way to close to turning their console into a PC. If I want a PC experience, I'll play on a PC.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>From what I've read, the Sony UBP-X1100ES seems to be the top rated 4k player right now. It's like $500. The thing is, I don't think anyone is making truly high end players anymore. Physical media is dying plus today's consumer seems to be content buying crap like all in one systems and really low end garbage. Luckily I snagged an Oppo Digital before they got out of the market. There was also a Yamaha that was excellent but I think they've stopped making BD players too. I checked retailers that I know sold it but it's gone MIA. There is a Panasonic (DP-UB9000) that goes for a grand but the Sony I mentioned earlier has been rated the best player on more than one list.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Actually as a 25+ year home theater  amp; audio hobbyist I am not surprised at how many people don't give a crap and/or just don't know higher quality performance when they see/hear it. So many people think DVD is hi-def, MP3 is awesome and their sound bars kick ass (eyes rolling hard). They think they're getting a deal by buying a model number down or a slightly cheaper brand when all they're really doing is saving $150 while throwing the $250 they spent away. IMO, entry level  amp; budget are synonyms for a waste of money. Of course this is from my own point of view. If someone is happy with a lower level of performance... More power to 'em.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>The X is more future proof though. If someone does move up to 4k they're gonna end up wanting the X. They'd be better off at present and in the long run paying the extra $250 now.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>All I can say is games running on a One S looked noticeably worse on a 4k TV. PSO2 for example is crisp, clear  amp; detailed on a One X into a 4k TV. But played on an S into a 4k TV is grainy and flat with washed out color. If you don't have a 4k TV the S models are fine.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Cool. You don't give a fuck about 4k. Well, we have three 4k TVs in the house so I do. And yes, I do still buy discs. It may be 2020 but there are cons to not having a physical copy. Besides, the new Series S  amp; X machines are fully backward compatible... All of my OG Xbox games are on disc as are my 360 games and around 3/4 of my Xbox One games, so having a disc drive is important. Ooooh, you have a spare hard dive laying around. I'm very proud of ya. I've got spare drives too, including unopened Sea of Thieves  amp; Jedi Fallen Order editions. The thing is, I don't want to negate the benefits of the SSD. Enjoy your S, your low res TV  amp; your long load times... Peace out my friend.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>If you're tooling along at 60mph in a sports car then yes, you wasted your money. But that doesn't mean the sports car CAN'T outperform the mid-tier car. It means you personally didn't need a sports car. Now imagine you're buying a car to drive like a sports car in the company of other sports cars... Get my point? Every piece of video related equipment in our home (TVs, home theater receivers, Blu-ray players, game systems, etc.) is 4k and has been for at least 2-3 years now. It's not a matter of want vs need. It's a matter of that's the level our system is operating at. I'm not trying to brag it's just electronic gear  amp; nothing more. The Series S just doesn't stack up to anything we have. So I guess it's want and need for me. If someone plans on never upgrading their TV from 1080p (or plays on a 1440p monitor) and thinks they'll be happy at a generally lower level of console performance, the Series S should be good for that person. I'm not that person.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Yup, even a 1tb drive on the Xbox One wasn't enough. I quickly filled a 2tb HDD and had to upgrade to 4tb. Next gen games are going to be much larger than X1 games were. With updates  amp; DLC, I've got several  gt;100gb games. It would not shock me to see 400gb Series S/X games. The built-in Series S storage could end up not being able to hold two full games. People who buy the S are gonna end up spending the difference on external storage. I'd rather have the superior machine.</TEXT>

I wouldn't even consider that unless the external was also a SSD. Considering the price of those (as of today), the best option is the Seagate expansion card (or whatever it's called) because the games will run directly off of it.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Not only aren't you getting the resolution with Series S, you're also getting half the storage space. Beside that the Series S won't play the One X game enhancements. As someone with only 4k TVs in the house, I don't see the Series S as much of an upgrade over the One X. Yeah, it's more powerful in some ways but in others it's not as good. Personally, I see the Series S as a waste of $250.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Illmac, as an observer in your little debate... Yes, your feelings are irrelevant as is how the films came to be what they are. Why they decided to bring Palpatine back to life doesn't matter. The fact is that's what they did. Luke was never intended to be Vader's Son but that's what George Lucas decided to do part way through. He didn't have half the story fleshed out until he made last minute decisions. That fact is well documented. It's also how story writing works. For you to imply that new content shouldn't make you rethink old content is na #239;ve, closed minded and (in Vader's words) unwise. You may not like the new content... That's your problem, but the fact is that it is what it is whether you approve or not. The theory expressed does make sense when you look at more than just the parts you pick  amp; chose. The story goes on and new events clarify and alter past perceptions. Whether any of us like it or not, Lucas was never that deep of a storyteller. It wasn't until fans started delving deeper into what George had written and the advent of the EU that Star Wars was anything more than simplistic sci-fi.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>In RotJ, they call it the Forest Moon of Endor. Why would the planet  amp; the moon have the same name? It was also known as Sanctuary Moon. The official Star Wars Databank calls it the Forest Moon OF Endor, not Endor. Here's the copy  amp; paste... Secluded in a remote corner of the galaxy, the forest moon of Endor would easily have been overlooked by history were it not for the decisive battle that occurred there. The lush, forest home of the Ewok species is the gravesite of Darth Vader and the Empire itself. It was here that the Rebel Alliance won its most crucial victory over the Galactic Empire. As for Wookieepedia, that's open to whatever someone wants to write. Common sense and the Star Wars Databank agree it's The Forest Moon, not Endor.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Sorry, I was editing as you posted. The way the Databank words it could be taken either way. The Forest Moon of Endor could be taken the same as saying "The City of New York" which actually means New York City, so yeah your interpretation could very well be correct. So could mine. I went the way I did because it just makes more sense that the planet  amp; moon not have the same name. You could very well be right though. Not everything in Star Wars makes perfect sense.</TEXT>

Just making a snap call, I figured the planet was Endor while the moon was either Forest Moon or Sanctuary Moon. That just makes more sense to me. Still, just to play Devil's Advocate... Canon can change and future content can clarify perceptions. Sorry, I had to throw that in (LOL). But yeah, I'm tending to agree with you now.</TEXT>

I love Eminem but other than Without Me and maybe one or two others most people (outside of actual fans) couldn't name any Eminem songs. Everybody knows Sweet Child O' Mine and November Rain.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>EXACTLY what I've been saying all along. That's simply how technology advances. Everyone whines about there being a 2nd Death Star then Starkiller Base. When something like the Aircraft Carrier was invented, they didn't stop at one. It was simply the first. One would reasonably believe the Empire (then the First Order) would have made several Death Stars along with advancing new weapons from it (Starkiller Base). Palpatine putting Death Star tech into Star Destroyers is another example of the evolution of technology. Had the writers come up with something completely new  amp; different, the same people would be bitching how unrealistic that is.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>It also had a lot to do with balance. Luke knew the constant conflict between the light and the dark would never bring lasting balance. The Jedi  amp; Sith both need to end, giving way to a balanced "grey" order. That's the direction Rian Johnson was trying to go. It's also where he was trying to take Rey  amp; Kylo. As much as people hate TLJ, it was the right direction. Rather than working from that, JJ bent to fan service. Don't get me wrong, I love TRoS, but I can't stand how it dismisses TLJ.</TEXT>

The Navy doesn't have one aircraft carrier. The air force doesn't have one F-15. The Empire wouldn't be expected to have one Death Star while The First Ordet should be expected to have advanced the weapon, which is exactly what they did.

    <TEXT>While classic certainly can refer to vintage, classic rock is more of a style. Look at someone like Alice Cooper. He has the vintage to be classic rock but the truth is he's not really classic rock. He's theatrical/glam shock rock. Bands like Boston and Fleetwook Mac... They're classic rock. At the same time Greta Van Fleet plays what could be considered classic rock. It's definitely more of a style than a vintage. Thinking of music in terms of new  amp; old is a narrow minded mistake. Classic rock will always be cladsic rock. Metal will always be metal and rap will always be rap. Yeah, there will probably end up a form of rap that is thought of as classic but that will be opposed to gangsta and other forms, not age. And yeah, IMO most of it is crap.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>While I'm not necessarily arguing for Rey, your argument doesn't hold much water. Being the chosen one does not equate to being the most powerful. It simply means that person is destined to do a particular thing. If you want to say all Rey did was deflect Palpatine's attack with lightsabers, I could just as easily point out that all Vader did was catch Palps off guard and pick him up, causing him to electrify himself. As you point out, Anakin had been training since he was a child... Yet Rey defeated Palpatine in an actual fight rather than a sneak attack like Anakin had done. Come to think of, that's how he took Mace out too. The reality is Anakin didn't defeat anyone other than Dooku and Younglings in (as you put it) any significant way. Nope, what he did was take two people out who thought he was on their side. Let's not forget how Ben chopped his ass up on Mustafar. Sounds more like a punk to me. Looks like Hayden played the character correctly after all.</TEXT>

Maybe you believe characters should remain stagnant and never evolve? Seriously, all of the arguments against the ST make no sense whatsoever. The OT, PT  amp; ST all focus on different events and different but tied characters. The OT focused on Luke while telling the story of Vader's redemption. The PT focused more on Anakin, Obi-Wan and Palpatine while telling the story of Anakin's fall. Just as the PT was the story of the OT's previous generation, the OT was the story of the ST's previous generation. Ben passed the torch to Luke who passed it to Rey. Ben died in doing so and so did Luke. Nothing out of the ordinary with the ST. Palpatine simply turned out to be the antagonist of all three generations. Basically the good guys came  amp; went while evil remained constant.</TEXT>

Sony  amp; Microsoft were in a console war but no more. Sony is the only one focusing on a console. Microsoft has turned to a bigger picture. They're looking at Xbox as a family of games and services that run across different platforms. If someone isn't playing an Xbox game on a console, they're playing it on a PC or an Android. The console itself (as a platform) doesn't mean as much to Microsoft as it does to Sony because the Xbox itself is just 1/3 of Microsoft's platform. Not even 1/3 when you consider how many more people own cell phones. If Sony is looking at this generation in terms of console wars, they're doing so alone.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Yes, there was a reason I put "surprise" in quotes. I should have spelled it out more by saying he wasn't revealed as the main antagonist until the third film. But, in a sense it was a surprise (in TRoS) as you yourself pointed out, he was talked about in ANH  amp; TESB where it was assumed he was long dead in TFA  amp; TLJ. The problem with the route they decided to take was the fact that they bowed to the negative feedback of TLJ and opted for an overkill of fan service. We all know the way TRoS played out was not where Rian Johnson was taking the story, but Star Wars "fans" had to whine and complain that he gave us something different and actually developed a particular character rather than having him be the exact same person he was 30 years prior. Instead of building off of TLJ, they decided to act like it didn't exist. TLJ may not have been a great movie in  amp; of itself but where it left off story-wise could have played out brilliantly without bringing Palpatine back. That said, bringing him back did tie the whole saga together. Was it the best way to go? Maybe not but I don't have a problem with it. The fact is with Snoke gone the story needed a big villain for Rey  amp; Kylo to fight. Hux just wasn't up to that role. Palpatine was revealed as the power behind Snoke just as he was with Vader. It's actually very poetic and very Star Wars. I know exactly how the Emperor was handled in the OT. I seen them all in the theaters when they first released and was actually old enough to know what was going on beyond it being a cool movie with laser swords. Hell, I had already finished school and moved out of my parents' house by the time RotJ hit theaters, so in all reality I was a young adult in '83. The Emperor was only mentioned briefly in ANH as the person who dissolved the Senate. As you said, every empire needs an Emperor, but he was never built up to be much more than a crooked ruler who Vader started reporting directly to after Tarkin was gone. The whole Sith thing hadn't been delved into at all at that point. Palpatine wasn't a prominent or particularly important character until RotJ and was never a developed character until the prequels. Many fans have forgotten that. It kills me how a lot of people complained that Snoke's story wasn't revealed in TLJ when we had to wait for a 2nd trilogy to know who Palpatine was. Star Wars fans have no patience.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I actually just ordered the 55" from Crutchfield. The 65" is only $50 more but I've read a lot of complaints about the 65" from both consumers  amp; reviewers. Apparently a lot of banding issues. Have you noticed any of that? The 55" I ordered is out of stock so I have time to change my order.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I don't know if they even could have been done chronologically as George didn't originally intend Vader to be Luke's Father. Had he done them chronologically, he may have made that revelation impossible. The thing is, they can say this is Canon or that is Canon but events can always change until they are actually played out in front of a camera. Did Palpatine create Anakin? We've heard different things over the years. Until we actually see what happened, It's always open to be changed. George was notorious for last minute changes as well as extremely superficial changes and additions. Look at Mace's purple lightsaber. Sam L. wanted purple so backstories were created after the fact. Hell, there's even been conflicting ones for something as simple as that... It's purple because he's a more of a Grey Jedi and purple is a mix of red  amp; blue. Then there's the explanation that it's electrum rather than crystal based. It's all Sci-Fi and is open to whatever they want whenever they want.</TEXT>

    <TITLE>A quick Sony X900H question</TITLE>
    <DATE>2020-10-06 03:12:50</DATE>
    <TEXT>I just ordered the 55" X900H from Crutchfield which is currently out of stock, meaning I have time to change my order. My question is for owners of the 65" model. I've read it has certain issues (such as color banding) not common on other screen sizes. Have any of you noticed any issues and if so are they limited to the earlier manufacturing dates or been fixed in any way? Any input would be appreciated as I'm thinking about updating my order to the 65".</TEXT>

    <TEXT>As someone who's been into home theater for nearly 30 years, I remember when the rear channels were of significantly less power than the front array. Most receivers ran 100 watts up front and around 40 watts in the back. The surrounds really don't do a lot the vast majority of the time. I'd be more concerned that my rears voice matched the fronts than having them be as powerful.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Yup, the RX-V6A. I have an RX-A780 that (as much as I love) I'm gonna have to replace because I need HDMI 2.1 for our new Sony X900H, upcoming Xbox Series X and eventual (maybe) PS5. The 6A also supports VRR  amp; ALLM. I suppose I could run the Xbox directly to the TV then run eARC to the 780 but i just don't like routing my gear that way. Besides, it'll be nice having the 780 in the man cave.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>The best way I can put it is to quote Sound  amp; Vision's Mark Hudson... I respectfully disagree with those who say it's not important to match the surrounds with the front speakers. All speakers have a certain tonal character, and speakers from a given manufacturer tend to have a similar character, while speakers from different manufacturers often have noticeably different tonal characteristics. If you combine front speakers from one company with surrounds from another company, chances are that, when a sound pans from front to back or vice versa #8212;say, when an airplane flies across the room as depicted above #8212;its tonal quality will change and potentially distract you, taking you "out of the movie." This mismatch of tonal character is not always noticeable #8212;you might get lucky and have no such problem with fronts from one company and surrounds from another. But for those who are buying a surround system, or adding surrounds to existing fronts, I recommend staying with one manufacturer to minimize the potential for tonal variations. Ideally, get surrounds from the same product line as the fronts, which further reduces the odds that the tonal character will be different between the front and back.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Well, we all have a way we like things. Beside, you don't know our setup. All of the gear is in a Sanus rack mount several feet away from the TV meaning I would have to run several long HDMI cables to the TV then run audio (in whatever form) all the way back to the receiver. Running short cables to the receiver then one longer HDMI to the TV makes much more sense and allows me different sound settings for each source. Or maybe I would simply like a new receiver so I could move the 780 to our game room? If you think pursuing a hobby is a fool's errand maybe you're in the wrong hobby?</TEXT>

    <TEXT>No, the blacks wouldn't necessarily be the same and in fact are not. It's more than just the panel. It's also dependant on things like color science and FALD algorithms I have never seen a Samsung that retains both depth of black and detail at the same time. When the blacks are truly black they lose detail. Adjust it so the detail is there and the blacks become grey. Sony's blacks stay black and have detail simultaneously. As for the Q80T  amp; Q90T, they are both more expensive than comparable Sony models of the same size and only edge Sony out by less than half a point according to RTNGS.com. Even in those cases, the Sony models come out on top in a few key areas like movie watching and HDR, contrast, local dimming, gray uniformity and picture gradient.</TEXT>

Do you want speakers that are warm, punchy, bright, accurate, etc., etc... ? I just switched from Polk Audio RTi A7 towers to Klipsch RP-280F series and the difference is huge. The Polk RTi towers were warmer and more refined, where the Klipsch are bolder and have an "in your face" presence. I wouldn't recommend one over the other though because that's a personal choice.

    <TEXT>That's the one I voted for. I went through the 80's not liking The Heads, then one night about ten or so years ago I was pretty high and (some how) ended up watching Stop Making Sense. Man, what a great concert. Since then I've turned several people on to the band who all said they couldn't stand them. They're one of those bands that once you give them a chance, they blown you away. I couldn't believe how many songs of theirs I knew.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Yeah, I reached deep and pulled Hooligan's Holiday out of my ass. I may be in the minority but I love the Corabi lineup. Misunderstood is probably my favorite Crue song period. Anyway, I wanted a wild card song so I figured Hooligan's Holiday would be a great one.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>While I buy online, I get what the OP is saying. A lot of the resurgence of vinyl has to do with the loss of a connection to music that used to exist. It used to be that someone would go to a store and browse along with buying what they went in for. Listening to music meant holding the packaging, looking at the artwork and reading the liner notes. Many people miss the entire experience. It's about more than simply buying and hearing. Accusing the OP of role playing is kind of fucked up, especially from people who are part of a group that spends much of their time posting about the vinyl they've acquired. Cheating may be the wrong term but the OP has a point.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>There's only ever one ad and it's often game related or for something available in the Xbox Store. Sometimes it's for something like a car, a movie, military enlistment, voter registration and stuff like that. Whatever it's for it's presented in an icon right along with everything else. Honestly, the ad icon blends in with everything so well you might not even recognize it as an ad. I find it far more tastefully done than it is on PS4. Then again I highly prefer the entire Xbox dashboard to that of the Playstation.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Don't pay any attention to the whiny haters who can't get past the fact it's not 1977 anymore and not everything focuses on the same old characters. 7, 8  amp; 9 are very much on par with the older films. Anything negative that can be said about them can just as easily be said of 1-6. Kylo is a far more intriguing and well written character than Anakin ever was. That said, the chronological order would be Solo, Rogue One then 7, 8  amp; 9.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>They changed and adapted the story as they went, exactly as George Lucas did. It just wasn't as widely known or discussed back in the days without the internet. As finished products, yes the ST is on par with the older films. Fans loved TFA until they didn't like TLJ. Sorry but Star Wars fans are hypocritical, whiny and only ever happy retroactively. Again, any flaws in the ST can be easily said of the OT  amp; PT. You're all great at pointing fingers without ever smelling the shit in your own house.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I'll put it to you this way... I can be very snobbish about gear. I believe in dedicated everything. I have an extremely competent OPPO Digital UDP-203 4k player as well as an Xbox One X. 9 times out of 10, I fire up the Xbox to play a disc. Why? I honestly don't know. Maybe because I'm afraid of wearing out my Oppo? I don't watch movies as critically as I listen to music, the Xbox is an absolutely fine player and is far easier to replace. Besides, there's very few really nice standalone players anymore. For the price of a Panasonic DP-UB9000 you can have two Xbox One X consoles and I'd bet you could barely see a difference.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I know the risks. I'm a bigger home theater enthusiast than gamer and I read lots of articles from more sources than just rtngs. Like I said, for casual gamers or those who change games a lot, OLED should be absolutely fine. But for someone who games a lot, especially the same game or games that are particularly bright with a lot of contrast, I don't think it's worth the risk. Also, if the TV is used for heavy gaming right from the get-go before having been properly broken in, the risk goes up. That's just reality.</TEXT>

You're not going to see a huge difference with most content. I break it down like this... OLED: Better performance in some aspects (mainly blacks) - Higher price - Risk of burn-in LED: Nearly as good blacks - Brighter than OLED - Lower price - No burn-in risk A good LCD is the better overall choice for gaming.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I always prefer source to receiver to TV. If your receiver won't pass 4k @ 120hz you'll have to go through the TV first. The problem is, or could be with eARC which is still very quirky. It may work or it may not. If you run into issues with eARC, you can always fall back on a Toslink cable from the TV to the receiver. You won't get Atmos but at least it will work. I'm in the same boat right now. We have a Sony X900H but our Yamaha RX-A780 tops out with HDMI 2.0. My solution is going to be a new Yamaha V6A.</TEXT>

Calling it a fad at this point is giving it too much credit. I'm not saying there's no hope for it, but in it's current state, it's already about as big as it's gonna get. Of course that's precisely why MS hasn't marketed an Xbox VR. There's no demand right now and the excitement  amp; hype are already things of the past.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I totally disagree. Yes, Van Halen became a different band but the Hagar years were great. They went from a straight up party band to one that actually had something to say. While I love the Roth years, I took the band far more seriously with Hagar. Apples  amp; oranges. Many fans think Corabi was a much better singer than Vince Neil and consider the lone album with him to be the band's best. For me personally, I think Misunderstood (which came from that album) is Motley's best song, period. All that said, I can't chose as I like them both.</TEXT>

It lacks real soul. I've given them (Rush) plenty of chances and have a few albums. In the end, the only song I really like of theirs is Roll the Bones.</TEXT>

Besides, my Sony X900H only has 4 HDMI inputs and only 2 of them are 2.1 compatible. All that said, I'd rather upgrade to the V6A which will allow me to run things the way I prefer...
