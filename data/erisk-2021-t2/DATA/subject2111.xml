    <TEXT>I did this w the last season. Bought it like 24 hrs before season two. I had been level 100 for ages but after buying I suddenly leveled up to 280. It gave me credit for all the challenges I finished just by playing. So it unlocked everything up to that level. I missed out on things- no purple sludge guy for me. But I actually made 100 vbucks after buying season two the next day.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Sympathy! I get it- i worry about the people i care about being restrained by my food issues. Sometimes i want them to get what they want enough that i loosen my own very strict rules for where i #8217;ll eat. Ive paid for it several times. Fact is- if you #8217;re celiac- most places cant really cater to you in the manner you need. At least in person you can go back and forth- even talk to the chef. Delivery- good freaking luck.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I have gastroparesis. Symptoms you suffered sound similar. Check it out and be careful- you dont want it getting worse- no matter what it is. Also- a lot of people dont consider a fodmap diet a long term diet- more a short term diet to alleviate symptoms while you work on gut healing. I used to be strictly low fodmap. Im FAR from better but at least i can eat many fodmap foods without issue now. Good luck! Hope you #8217;re feeling better soon</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Weed helps with all of my gut issues. Just be super careful about the munchies. If I eat too much my stomach will just become paralyzed. Munchies are my enemy. But usually if I can get past that first little wave of hunger that the weed gives me I #8217;m able to ride out the rest of it with very little pain and feeling all good. I will say that when I started growing my own I had more success with the weeds affect on me as well. Most weed is grown for recreational high. I left half of my plants a couple weeks longer to grow. That left me with a heavy body high that really gets rid of most of my symptoms but doesn #8217;t affect my head as much. I can still get stuff done</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Turned 41 on Wednesday. Easy but lovely hike planned w my sis  amp; nephews. Worry the whole week before. Super careful w everything. Wake queasy. Usually would reschedule but its my bday  amp; dont want to disappoint my nephews. Hr drive from 4000 altitude to 0. Get to the hiking trail. Waves of pain make nausea insane. Consider turning back. Take meds instead. Make everyone have to sit for 25 min. Feel slightly better. Walk 2 min. Sit. Throw up. At least i can tell meds are in because it feels like hot waters being poured through the folds of my brain. Take more meds. Sit more. Walk a min. Throw up. Again. Again. Finally meds in enough to walk without being sick. Enjoy my hike. Home to terrible migraine hangover. Another threatening to flare any moment. 3 days recovering. Happy bday to me The worst was having my family (especially my nephews) see me like that. Usually I #8217;m in a dark room and nobody has to see me when I #8217;m throwing up and shaking in pain. If anything it was a lesson to continue rescheduling because I don #8217;t like subjecting my family to watching me in so much ugly pain</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I hate hearing things like  #8216;just stop feeling sorry for yourself #8217; or  #8216;helpful #8217; comments like  #8216;you just need to get out more #8217; but they #8217;re kinda right. From a person who hurts every day- just like you- this IS your life. The only one you #8217;re gonna get. This. Is. Your. Life. Now- you don #8217;t Want to live this life of pain. But can you? You are, already, aren #8217;t you? Maybe not as kindly- to yourself or other- as you could. But you are doing it. Because you don #8217;t have any other choice. Now try doing it well. Try bringing what joy you are able into your life as well as your loved ones. Start small. A friend of mind literally put a rubber band on his wrist  amp; for every negative or unkind thought- he #8217;d give himself a small snap w it and make himself think a kind thought instead. I never went that far but i do keep a gratefulness journal where each night i write down 10 things i am grateful for that day (3 is typical but im very prone to depression and 10 takes more time in a positive frame of mind). They can be little things. The good meal. Or the weird bug you saw. It sounds woo-woo but the point is to get yourself used to thinking in a more positive way. This can literally lower your pain levels since pain is a symptom of depression. Why make yourself worse. Your condition doesn #8217;t need the help. Also- im not saying to never grieve or be angry or cranky. Im get down for days sometimes. I sob big ugly tears even though in me this can trigger a days long migraine. But its ok and normal and even healthy to feel and express those emotions. But not all the time. You grieve. Then you start working on those happy thoughts again. And you don #8217;t get to batter those around you with your pain. They suffer in their own way- seeing you in pain and not being able to fix or help you. Keep that in mind and be kind. Share the emotions but not as a weapon. WE are sad that i feel so badly today. WE wish this wasn #8217;t happening and what can we do to feel better in any way- be that watching a moving on tv together or snuggling or going to separate rooms so each can deal in peace. It sucks. Ive been this way almost 20 years. It sucks every day. But mostly i enjoy my life. I can do light hikes on good days and on bad i hardly get out of bed except to use the restroom ( amp; honestly i have more bad then good- thats my reality). But every day i can find some good moments and this makes tolerating the bad a tiny bit easier.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Or you could be one of those people who despite suffering had people in awe for what they still accomplished. A huge number of people who did amazing things also suffered in one way or another. Its a dud if you give in and just sit around like a lump. Even if you cant get out of bed you could help others and be able to feel good about yourself for that. Even kind words to those desperately trying to stay above water in their shit lives can make your life have some worth beyond the suffering. I know it helped me to hear someone was there for me when i was close to choosing to opt out. Feeling pity for yourself all the time will be what leads to a miserable life. Not your condition.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Everybody is different  amp; i (so far) am not as bad as many. I have been able to control it somewhat w diet stuff and a few supplements. So maybe some of it will help you but no promises. I could just be lucky I #8217;m not getting worse. I pay a LOT of attention to my gut. If i start having issues i right away cut back on my fat  amp; protein  amp; all my fiber is well cooked or  #8216;predigested #8217; meaning i put it through a spin with my vitamix (a crazy expensive blended i was lucky enough to be gifted. Put in anything and after a few minutes its smooth and not a trace of seeds or coarseness). I take triphala - a supplement- with my food as needed. I prefer to to take it before i eat if i notice my stomach feels off- but if i get that heavy feeling that is my first sign of not digesting- i #8217;ll take it then. I just usually take a little extra. I also if it feels very bad- will take a couple oregano oil capsules. I dont no exactly why they help me. I have two theories. 1- its a natural antibacterial and helps keep the food from starting to rot as fast before my body bothers creating stomach acid. 2- it burns like crazy if you pop one in your mouth (trust me- dont do it) so maybe it stimulates stomach acid or something. Lastly- i super focus on the most nutrient dense foods. Liver. Egg yolks. Gelatin. Sea food. Etc. Give my body the building blocks to do better. Makes a huge difference for me and my pain/exhaustion levels. If you hate organ meat- they sell capsules of it freeze dried and stuff. I still have episodes and if i slack they can get bad. But when i pay attention i can get things back under control pretty quickly......usually.</TEXT>

    <TITLE>Is sugar free  amp; low carb the same?</TITLE>
    <DATE>2020-05-30 20:19:59</DATE>
    <TEXT>This is an absolutely genuine question. I know I do very badly with refined sugar- I actually get edema in my ankles and it triggers terrible migraines. I can #8217;t even have too much fruit or anything like that. And I don #8217;t have the self-control to limit myself very well. So I was thinking the best thing I could do was just cut out sugar all together. But does that mean I have to watch out for the foods that turn into sugar? Do I need to restrict things like pasta and stuff? I #8217;d really appreciate any advice from people who have already started down this route. Thanks in advance.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>My dog does it all the time. Literally twice a month cause he zooms on cement. I keep him from licking it and if it looks particularly sore i put some cream (i would for that wound!) on  amp; if he keeps bugging it i wrap it in gauze  amp; medical wrap (the stuff like ace bandage but it sticks to itself so no need for tape) for a day or two....probably consider this since its on the pads where they touch the ground. If your dog wont let it alone then he gets the cone of shame. If he still seems in a lot of pain take him in or if hes still really bothered by it on another 24 hrs or so. My guy might still look kind of raw for a couple days but after the first day or so he usually could care less about it.</TEXT>

He also has enjoyed his life quite a bit- dirt biking, sailing for months at a time,  amp; once almost dying after he crashed while hang-gliding. Hes just sore. He wakes stiff and after a days work he moved like an old man. Some old sailors told him about boron and since taking it he doesn #8217;t need the Tylenol or Ibuprofen to move without pain. A week or two without it he starts walking hunched and groaning when he moves certain ways again without even realizing it.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I agree- but hes a stubborn guy. Its the level that makes him feel best  amp; he aint gonna listen to anyone tell him to do it differently. He does at least recognize the signs that hes taking a bit too much  amp; he #8217;ll drop the amount. I think he said he feels almost like hes had too much caffeine but not in a good way. Kind of jittery and just not feeling great. I dont love it but he put himself in the hospital once several yrs ago when the anti-inflammatories he was taking ate through his stomach  amp; he almost bled out- so i keep my mouth shut about the boron. Better then the old meds.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>The supplements i had the most outstanding success with (the only thing i take now besides magnesium) are desiccated organ meat capsules. I take one of just liver, one of mixed organs, and one brain and liver. Its a night and day difference. When i take them I actually have some energy. My pain levels go down. Im able to think more clearly. My depression becomes much more manageable. My PMS symptoms are less agonizing. I even seem to get less migraines. Besides being insanely high in a ton of nutrients- the premise in organ meat is to eat what you need help with. Bad kidney- eat kidney- because it has the nutrients your kidneys need to work their best. I dont no how valid it all is but it makes sense to me and i know they make me feel so SO much better</TEXT>

    <TEXT>It looks older and healing. Id give it a couple days. Clean it and keep it dry. Make sure she cant lick it. If she gets worse or isn #8217;t getting better then take her in. I found stuff like this all the time when i worked as a groomer. The dog gets poked w a stick or bit by something and it scabs. The scab in the fur pulls on the skin  amp; it also traps everything down there. Once you open it to the air they pretty much heal on their own. Only exception was if there #8217;s something imbedded- id find fox tails imbedded in the center of nasty scabs and wounds frequently. Your pic doesn #8217;t look like that at all but im not a vet. It does sometimes help to shave the fur back just a bit so dirty fur isn #8217;t sticking to the wound. Just like a 1/2 inch all around it can help a ton.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I think its less that more education could be accomplished by decreasing the budget and more that with better educated police we could afford to decrease the budget. Honestly i cant claim to think i have a really clear idea- but it feels like we #8217;re almost on a war footing. We spend so much money on armored vehicles and weapons and defensive gear and so forth. When you contain crime by crushing the people- history says people only put up with that for so long before they decide they #8217;ve had enough. People are angry and frustrated and afraid. Nothing good comes from masses of people feeling this way. Good education. Housing with heat and water. Basic necessities like food and jackets. Programs for kids and teens (because we whine about the kids and bad parenting so how about we shut up and get more programs in place to help them). When people struggle to feed their kids and their house is falling down around them and when kids see their parents in tears of rage or sadness at their lot in life.....its hard for good to come from that Helping with those things and so much more instead of just putting more cops on the street might make things better. We have spent decades cracking down on  #8216;criminals #8217; one way or another and yet still things seem to get worse (crime is down- but distrust and rage seems higher). Fear of cops doesn #8217;t seem to stop crime If we have programs the cops are very involved in- pay them and require it as part of the job if we need to- a few days on the streets and one where they are part of the community. Where they interact weekly for hours at a time with the people and kids of the streets they work. I don #8217;t care if they #8217;re helping construct homes for the homeless or tutoring at risk kids with their schoolwork- get them around the people so they see the people they protect instead of just  #8216;criminals #8217; and  #8216;thugs #8217;. Let the people know the police as also part of their community- instead of as the boogeyman who give can and will ruin your life in a second by ending you (or a loved one) in jail or dead</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Honestly- maybe keep a food journal and try cutting out xanthan gum only if you really think it could make a difference. Xanthan gum is in dang near everything! Skin care products, most tooth paste, salad dressing- good luck finding one without it. So dont do that to yourself unless you really need to. It started giving me head to toe hives and that was the only reason i cut it completely. You could have an issue with it- or or it could be some other food or ingredient. Xanthan gum is created from a mold- and from what I #8217;ve read- people with mold sensitivity can be more prone to issues with it as well. Just throwing that out there. Good luck with whatever you try</TEXT>

I had kids i worked with who received aid from those charities you see on tv where you donate just 10 cense a day or something and help a child in need. It paid for their school uniform and schooling and food for the family. The people were great (mostly- some men were scary) and the country was beautiful- but the whole place was a big wake up call. The best areas looked the run down sections of LA and the poor areas were little more then cardboard and plywood shacks. In the poor areas they drank from the river they also bathed and did laundry in- they had no other option.

    <TEXT>Maybe you just changed your diet too fast. Even small changes in your diet can have an effect on your gut bacteria. When you are dramatically changing your diet overnight it could just be way too much for your body. Maybe even though it #8217;s tempting to jump straight in and for some people that works better #8230; Maybe you need to slowly change your diet over or maybe a month or so until you get to the elimination phase. I react very strongly to changes in my diet. If I go from my normal eating and for example cut out sugar within 24 hours I #8217;m puking my guts out.

    <TEXT>I have 100+ pound dog does not play around with other dogs. Hate even looking at other dogs. But i hike with him off leash. It took years with long leashes before I trusted him completely. He comes 100% of the time when i call- even when there are other dogs, coyotes, cats, people, dont matter- he comes. Despite this I still have him off leash only when I can see well ahead of me and behind. When we #8217;re heading towards a curve in the trail or if the entire trail is too winding- he #8217;s on leash. If I spot any people he #8217;s on leash. If I see dogs with them i call ahead that he #8217;s not friendly and they should leash their dogs Despite this I recently had an incident where two labs were off leash and the people returned my call of- he #8217;s not friendly with  #8216;don #8217;t worry they #8217;re super friendly #8217;- as their dogs bolted off leash towards me. I dropped my dogs leash and put my hands in the air. I knew keeping my hand on his leash was the worst possible thing I could do. He took several steps forward to meet them and my everlasting thanks they were super friendly and super super non aggressive. They practically threw themselves on the ground in front of him and showed him their belly. He was in full alpha dog mode- tail up and his hair up- just glaring. Ignoring him and the labs and their owners- I walked at a decent pace down the trail and called my dog. He came immediately but for minute I thought there might be a fight when the labs tried to follow him. He got pissed they were on his heel. I took a stomping step towards them and hissed and made myself look scary and the labs screeched to a stop  amp; reluctantly went after their owners WHO btw were are completely useless in this entire scenario  amp; just kept reassuring me how friendly their dogs were until finally I snapped rather rudely that their dogs might be friendly but that mines wasn #8217;t  amp; if theirs had shown any aggression mine would have tried to kill their dogs. And don #8217;t tell me that if my dogs like that I shouldn #8217;t have him out. I have complete control over my dog. If your dog is on leash there is no issue</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Personally- i hate most of puppyhood- its so much work vs once your dog is grown and knows his manners. Enjoy his cuteness and hopefully it makes up for loosing sleep  #128517; #129322; The way i do it is placing the pups in a bed by my bed also. Far away from people- as much as it might be nice to have a quiet nights sleep- is much more traumatic for the dog. I plan to take the puppy out at least twice through the night and probably as early as 6 in the morning. You want to do your best to not let them have an accident in the house- and especially in a crate. With this and taking them out every 2 hours or so and after each meal through the day usually leads to my pups being potty trained within a couple weeks- occasional mistake aside. Make sure their bed is comfy and warm. I #8217;ll throw a shirt i wore that day over a teddy bear for them to smell and snuggle. If they #8217;ve been asleep for a while and wake whining- take them outside on a leash without giving them too much rewarding attention. (If you can- take water away by 7 or 8 at night so they wont have as much to pee out.) Keep things mellow and quite- you DONT want to rile them up when you #8217;d rather be sleeping. Stand there and talk gently. Dont walk around or be interesting- bored puppies will more quickly pee or poo. If they do start going- say your potty word while they do- mine is  #8216;go pee pee #8217; for pee and  #8216;go pee pee more #8217; for poop (wish i picked better but im too lazy to train a new word to it). No joke they go on command after a few weeks (unless they dont have to go in which depending on your dog #8217;s personality- they will either pretend to go in order to please you or they #8217;ll look at you like you #8217;re an idoit #8217;). Its awesome. Back inside and back into the crate- night time is not play or even cuddle time (though a bit as they settle might be a reward for putting up with the crate for some). If they continue to whine too loud try shushing quietly or talking softly. You dont really want to do too much petting or anything when they whine because it teaches them whining gets them what they want. Even yelling is better then the quiet for some dogs (music can help with this. Or guided meditation recordings- i find the mellow even tones of the voice and mellow background music will put a ton of dogs right to peaceful sleep) If their crate is right by your bed you can try sleeping with your arm dangling beside it- maybe with a couple fingers through. Ive had some this calmed and put to sleep quickly because they didn #8217;t feel alone- and ive had some this made whine more because they wanted more then just fingers. Up to you if you want to try- not the most comfortable but if it allows you to sleep..... Cant think of much more right now. Good luck. They grow super quickly so after a couple weeks they #8217;ll likely no longer need bathroom at night so long as you take them out late enough at night and not too late in the morning. The whining usually settles after a few days of same routine- once they get used to no more night time cuddle buddies/siblings. One last thing- if you intend to allow your dog to sleep with you throughout its life you can just bring him on the bed with you and snuggle. You #8217;ll both probably have a pretty peaceful night. You #8217;ll be able to feel him up and walking around when he needs to go to the bathroom. I #8217;ve done this with one and only one of my dogs ever. It was fun and I don #8217;t regret it and eventually he did learn to sleep on his own. Eventually he even preferred it. But usually dogs are bed hogs and I don #8217;t like to share. But only do this if you intend it to be something you always do. Usually you never want to start something with a dog that you don #8217;t intend to continue throughout his life.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>It could be allergies. But as a (former) groomer my first try would be dry skin. Wet him- cover his hair well with conditioner (you should never use human shampoo but many human conditioners work great- just go for ones with the fewest chemicals and perfumes). Let him sit in it for 10 min or so then rinse. See if he seems better over the next 24 hrs or so. If that doesn #8217;t work id agree to look into allergies. Food ones are common. You could try a single source food that #8217;s preferably grain free- fish is the one ive seen most dogs clear up on. If he #8217;s sensitive to fleas it could take just a single flea to do what your saying. I worked with a pup who would loose all the hair on his butt  amp; tail from just one or two fleas. Unfortunately some of the pills and drops only kind of work nowadays- fleas more and more seem to be becoming somewhat resistant. The conditioner honestly could help with this too #8230; They don #8217;t say it on the flea control shampoos but pretty much any shampoo you left on a dog for 10 minutes at least is going to kill most of the fleas. Could be environmental- but hopefully not because those are more troublesome. There are other issues it could be- most you need a vet to figure out unfortunately. Good luck</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Dobermans are really good dogs but they are definitely high energy. If you #8217;re going to leave them home for multiple days a week throughout the day you #8217;re gonna want to make sure you plan for lots and lots of entertainment. I have a Rhodesian ridgeback so I am in a somewhat similar situation. I found very quickly that if I didn #8217;t wear him out through play and exercise he will decide at midnight that he wasn #8217;t tired and since I hadn #8217;t been playing with him I must not be either. Now he gets a good bit of his food from treat dispensing toys. That way hes kept busy and entertained. I also have a pretty good size toy box of toys that I rotate. He gets a few toys one day, different toys the next, then different again the next after that so he doesn #8217;t have a chance to get bored with them. There #8217;s more stuff but I #8217;m sure you #8217;ll figure it out. If you decide to go that path good luck.

    <TEXT>I know there have been studies where women on birth control prefer the oder of closer male relatives and those of more similar genetics vs when not on birth control- when they prefer males of greater genetic difference. This has led to women who love the scent of their husbands/boyfriend to suddenly find their partners scent off putting once they go off birth control in order to try getting pregnant. I haven #8217;t really heard of any similar studies in men but I wonder if anything hormonal/etc that could have a similar effect</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Im at a friends house and cut off from getting help. I had to hike to get my phone working. I wont have a way out of here until tomorrow. My phone wont actually call out- for some reason im only getting internet service and some texts going through so i cant get through to my vet and ive been trying since this happened last evening around 6pm My 30lbs dog went in my friends garage and ate one of those green stick/bars of rat poison. She has no idea what kind- they #8217;re over a yr old. Its a good sized bar and i only caught him eating the last piece. I didnt no what it was but my friend started freaking out and apologizing. Within 5 min i used the injector i have in my dogs first aid kit and had peroxide down him. He barfed up until nothing but clearish yellow bile was all that came. Id given him dinner about 20 min before this so it was dog food and a ton of that green rat poison. Then i got some charcoal my friend keeps for if her dogs get some lizard up here that gives them diarrhea. I know charcoal is good for poison but i dont no how much or anything. I mixed a good amount in water and used the injector to get it in him. He ate a bit a few hrs later (i mixed in more charcoal- i hope im not hurting him more) He seems ok. Hes acting like himself. Is there a chance i got it out fast enough and he #8217;ll be ok? Is my dog going to die? Please let me no anything i can do. Tomorrow as soon as the ride gets here i #8217;ll rush him to the vet</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I worked as a mobile dog groomer and about 10 years ago I was grooming a dog about once a month for this young reasonably well-off couple. They traveled often. They had a nice sized RV. The woman had had a bit of well done cosmetic work. She was very chatty and always seemed very happy. They seem to really love their life. Then I didn #8217;t go to their house for about three months. I knew the woman had been pregnant and I worried that something had happened. She has seemed less happy as she was pregnant #8230; obviously her activities were curtailed by her enormous belly and by her need to eat and drink things that weren #8217;t going to hurt the baby. Finally they had me come back out. The woman answered the door- screaming baby in arms. She looked ragged #8230; miserable. She straight up told me she regretted her child so much. That she wish more than anything that she had never had him. He had messed up their entire life. They couldn #8217;t go anywhere or do any of the things that they enjoy. She said that all of her friends and family were having kids and it just seemed the thing to do. But she said her and her husband were both realizing now that they had a baby- they didn #8217;t really want to be parents. I never went to the house again. I don #8217;t know what happened. They just never called me back out. But I hope whatever they decided to do was the best thing for all three of them I had decided at age 11 that I was never giving birth. I #8217;ve always said that I would wish to foster someday. But the thing is #8230; I can afford to be selfish. If I want to wait until I #8217;m in my 60s to foster that #8217;s perfectly fine. I #8217;m not restricted by my ovaries. I can wait until I #8217;m the best person to give a child a home. I get to live my life how I want until then. Be selfish. It might be the very best thing you ever do for yourself, your partner, and for any child you might think to bring into this world</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I #8217;d recommend maybe private rescues instead of city animal shelter for your rescue- they know their dogs much better and you can tell them your requirements and preferences and they can suggest dogs in their care that are more likely to be a good fit. A lot of these dogs are fostered (does super depend on the rescue) -many are housed with cats. I #8217;ve rescued many dogs from the local shelters- but I #8217;ve had dogs my whole life and have lots of experience training. When you rescue from there the dogs often change dramatically one they #8217;re in a home and settled- the same is somewhat true of any dog/situation- but better chance of getting what you want when the people you #8217;re dealing with know the dog well (shelter dogs most typically move in and out quickly and it #8217;s a traumatic environment which stifles many dogs natural behavior). I think if you put effort into learning what your dog needs- you can be an amazing owner even as a first timer. Just educate yourself. I worked as a dog groomer for years. I was often surprised the things that I just assumed that everyone knew that first time owners had no clue on.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Working with animals. In any capacity but in particular i was a groomer. Dogs bite. They bark and howl for hours. They have anal gland juice you need to squeeze out. They drool. And pee and poop. They will then sometimes throw a fit and fling that pee and poop all over you. When you have spent 2 hrs bathing and brushing and clipping a dogs and your are 5 min from finished and blow drying those last slightly damp place- the dog will suddenly find a way to pee or poop into the air of the dryer......im sure you can imagine the results. Then theres their owners. People- we no what a well groomed dog looks like, and we no what it looks like when you at least try, and we can tell when you dont even own a dog brush- stop lying. Dont show us pictures of show dogs on calendars and ask us to make your dog look like that. We cant- you dont have a show dog. Give that up. I could go on as im sure we all could about our respective jobs- but ya......</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Agree with all this. It is a HARD job. I am no longer a groomer because i fell on the job and broke my wrist. Didnt heal 100% and now i cant finish one job without dropping my tools and risking myself and the dog. But on the other hand- during the great recession several yrs ago my boss HIRED two new groomers and i bought a house. Never slowed down. I was grooming dogs (mobile) for people who still had me come out every 2 or 3 weeks but were loosing their houses because they had no money. People kept spending money on their dogs. Also- dont do cats if you can avoid it. They account for 10% of your business (on average) and 80% of the injuries (according to my old work).....unless you #8217;re very brave and very good- then you can make really good money off them</TEXT>

    <TEXT>(American here so had to google the size thing- sorry) i would personally go with the 90x110. My pup is just a tiny bit bigger than yours and those dimensions are actually a little wider than a crib mattress here but also a fair amount shorter- though I #8217;ve found the crib mattresses are typically longer than the dog really needs. Most of the mattresses are 4-6 inches deep- mine is 5in....12.7cm? The mattresses can be firmer than a typical dog bed so I eventually shoved an old pillow under the sheet on one side so my picky beast could rest his head on something but otherwise he loves it. Hope you find what works for you!</TEXT>

If you like it- welcome fellow groomer. Dont be afraid to take it slow. These are pets- but they #8217;re not your pets. Dogs have teeth and many will use them. You want to develop your dog-sense. Really learn to read them. Also- keep your face away from theirs as much as possible and especially while doing nails.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>You #8217;ve already been working w them in an environment where they #8217;re similarly more reactive so you #8217;ll probably have an easier time and more realistic view then a lot of people. My boss used to send the people w no experience out w me (we worked mobile) and most didn #8217;t continue. I didnt do it on purpose- but i wanted them to understand- you will get bit-  amp; all that so they would be as safe as possible for their own sake as well as the dogs. I saw a new groomer get her entire lower lip ripped off when i #8217;d been working about 3 yrs and it made me very cautious- especially until i saw they had that dog sense. But i loved working as a groomer (ended with an injury in late 2017). Its also good money if you #8217;re good with the dogs and the customers. I personally loved mobile grooming over shop any day. I was out and about instead of stuck inside all day. I got to charge more for the service and as a side effect- the customers were people who generally took better care of their dogs (i saw a lot less neglected coats and neglected dogs working mobile).</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I would always soften up hard clumps with conditioner. Just put a little conditioner on the spot and let it soak for a few minutes and then see if you can break it up with your fingers a little. And then let it sit for a little bit longer. And eventually it #8217;ll be soft enough you can just comb right out. It worked for most things. And you can do very small spots at a time and then use a damp cloth to get the leftover conditioner out. It might not be the best idea for large areas but small spots on the face or something it #8217;s always what I used on dogs that would bite me for any pain at all. And we could get it done without too much issue</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Dogs are DEFINITELY less scary than cats. I started getting shaky when they started screaming after one serious injury requiring stitches and decided i no longer wanted to groom cats. Never regretted that. On the other hand- you have to learn how to hold dogs trying to bite you......while you groom their face. Sometimes you win them over. Sometimes they are far from perfect and the customers have to be made to understand. I usually called and warned the customer or in some way gave them a heads up long before heading to the door with any less than perfectly cut dog- unless we discussed the possibility beforehand. Honestly i won them over 9 times out of ten- but sucked when it was all you could do to keep the dog from cutting itself open trying to bite your scissors and have to send them back less their (and your) very best</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Np. Just wanted to add- you can use this outside of baths. I even used it once in a while on dogs when I #8217;d already bathed/dried them and realized I #8217;d missed something. You can use a small drop of conditioner on your finger and even do little areas around the eyes without getting any in- then damp cloth corner can take off the bit of conditioner left. But there are some good suggestions on here so you probably wont need this.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Only thing I want to add- reluctantly- is to consider histamine. I went on a VERY similar diet to your purposed diet and I saw improvement but once I started considering histamine levels I saw so much more improvement in my joint pain and brain fog. It also allowed me to start bringing in more variety once I got my histamine levels down. Maybe consider gelatin/collagen. Not low histamine but even adding small amounts helped me a lot. Also- organ meat makes a night and day difference. If I don #8217;t have liver for a few days I start feeling all my symptoms soooo much. more. My energy levels go way down. It sucks. If you can afford it you can get organ meat capsules. https://smile.amazon.com/Ancestral-Supplements-Grass-Organs-Desiccated/dp/B06XP7Z1KN/ref=redir_mobile_desktop?ie=UTF8 amp;aaxitk=PkxWMDC5B04og6VJHCcHXw amp;hsa_cr_id=6135295430601 amp;ref_=sbx_be_s_sparkle_mcd_asin_2 is the brand I use. I take the multi organ- also used to use their pure liver and still take their brain (omg the brain helps my brain fog). All the benefit but none of the gross. If you can #8217;t afford try eating the organ meat (to save cash I buy liver and eat it as is. Not yum but for how much better it makes me feel I get that stuff down) Canned fish/clams/oysters are a lot cheaper than fresh but just as healthy. Super high histamine though.

    <TEXT>He can also either have something in his throat- or have swallowed something that scratched his throat. My dog ate some fox tails and kept doing something similar. I was freaking out that he had something stuck. Rushed him to the vet. Turned out it scratched his throat all up  amp; we just had to wait it out. But there could also possibly be something there. It looks to me more like hes trying to cough something up then dry coughing like they can if their hearts are going bad or something. Ive even had a dog do something similar when he had one of my moms waist length hairs caught in his throat (poor guy- helping him was kinda gross too- but least no vet visit) Take him in to be checked soon as you can if you need to- and immediately if it keeps up or gets worse or he starts showing other signs of distress</TEXT>

    <TEXT>So I have the same piercing in each ear. Took me almost a year to heal completely to where I never had any issues. I tried all the stuff my piercer and everyone online suggested and still thought I #8217;d have to take them out. So I started doing what I do for all my other injuries and after using a q-tip to get out the pus (I pushed until I heard a pop and it all came right out). Then I started putting manuka honey with a UMF rating of 15 on it. Then tiny q-tip of good quality olive oil to keep things from sticking. Sounds weird but healed it really fast. After it looked better (few days) I started honey only at night and oil during the day (i usually didn #8217;t even get any on my pillow through the night because it was only a small amount). I #8217;d rotate the earring back and forth a tiny bit (not enough for the part I touched to go through the hole) to get the honey inside and several time through the day so I didn #8217;t build up scab that would adhere to the earring (when scabs formed they also tore loose and opened up the injury again). I did this for about 3 weeks and it looked great. Stopped and about a week later it happened again. After that I just kept up the routine for about 8 weeks. Never have had an issue again since. Been about 3 years. Up to her if she wants to try- I no it #8217;s not the info you find around but it #8217;s the only thing that finally worked for me. Also- the honey thing isn #8217;t woo woo stuff- Doc #8217;s use it. There #8217;s even a doc brand of bandaids and whatnot with the honey already set to go. Learned about it when my brother ended up in the hospital with a MRSA infection in his knee. Good luck. If she can get it healed the piercings ended up some of my favorite.</TEXT>

It used to be if I searched a video on how to kill the fire ants in my yard I would see a whole bunch more suggestions on the same thing and then a couple on things I had looked at before.

    <TEXT>I #8217;m currently struggling hugely to get back on track. So I get the struggle. I once went an entire year sugar free. The first couple months for me were hard. But eventually I got to where I hardly even ate fruit because I didn #8217;t want it. A cucumber tasted sweet. But then like a dummy I thought I could control my sugar cravings. So I started having things with more sugar added and within maybe two weeks I had spiraled completely out of control. So I promise you it does get easier eventually. But for me it wasn #8217;t 30 days it was probably around the four month mark and I realized I wasn #8217;t having any cravings at all anymore. If you get there and somebody offers you a cookie or something don #8217;t be polite and take it. If you #8217;re addicted to sugar it #8217;s forever. If I can get back to that point I #8217;m never touching that stuff again</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I totally understand. When I was an older teen we had a husky mix named Lobo. He had the most beautiful howl. We lived up the street from the fire department and every time it went off he would start howling- he was the first dog we ever had that did that. He taught our other dogs. He was a wonderful dog and he died far too soon at just five years old. But the dogs continue to teach each new generations of dogs to howl. Two years ago we moved out of the city and into a rural area. It sounds silly because a lot of people find the noise annoying but I was really sad to think my dogs would stop howling. So imagine my surprise and amusement when days after we moved here they all suddenly started howling for no reason I could discern. Eventually very very faintly in the distance I could hear the tiniest bit of a siren. Apparently it was enough. It was even enough to teach our newest puppy. Lobo lives on</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I think some of it is that they also feel as though they don #8217;t get as much say the city people. My dad lives in the boonies of New York. He #8217;s in ranch country. His nearest neighbor is half a mile or so away. The people where he lives hunt and fish and do a lot of things you simply cant in the city. But the city of New York has the bulk of the people. They pass most of the laws- including restrictive gun laws, laws that restrict land use, etc- which might not be a bad thing in the city but make less sense for people in more rural areas. So the rural people place themselves against city people and their more liberal interfering beliefs. At least- this is what I #8217;ve seen and experienced. I #8217;m fourth generation California and have been a city girl until about the last two years so I have limited experience.

    <TITLE>Rattlesnake encounter triggers a migraine?!</TITLE>
    <DATE>2020-07-12 16:14:36</DATE>
    <TEXT>I live in a somewhat rural part of Southern California where rattlesnakes are a thing. I found 4 on my property last year that I relocated myself. A large part of my yard is enclosed by snake proof fencing so I can have a safe space for my dogs and nephews and niece to play safely. Well yesterday around 8:30 at night i walked out with my dogs to let them go to the bathroom. All the sudden i hear a rattle and one of my dogs jumps. I screamed and called them frantically and rushed them into the house. I did a quick check but i was sure they were fine- it was near dark and bad light but i had seen a bit of the snake and was sure the dogs hadn #8217;t been close enough to be bit- but i was scared badly. That part of the yard was supposed to be safe. Plus- the yard was big. I had to deal with the snake before it managed to hide in a toy or something. I ended up killing it- even though i feel terrible for it. I always relocate- but ive always found them in the day before. I couldn #8217;t risk loosing him in the dark. Or getting bit myself! As soon as it was done i felt the first sharp stabs of pain in my head. The tightness of my neck. The nausea. I tried everything to keep it from coming but this morn I #8217;ve been sick several times already. Cant even keep down my meds. The fear and adrenaline somehow instantly triggered a migraine. I #8217;ve never had this before. Has anyone else had an event that just instantly brought one one? This sucks so bad.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Im on day 7. Been binging on  amp; off for months. Previously i was sugar free a yr. Im dreading the next little while. I know for me- sugar craving last time didnt stop completely until i was almost 4 months in. Ugh. But i felt so SO much better. Need to get back there. I don #8217;t allow over 2 grams. Low sugar fruits like berries and most melons. No added sugar at all- even honey. Plan to lower all carbs somewhat but for now im eating rice, plaintain chips, quinoa, etc when im craving sugar. But chocolate. OMG do i want chocolate right now!!! Once im back to no craving- im sticking to it. I started allowing sugar back in last time through almond milk yogurt. I told myself i was eating something healthy but it was high sugar. I started w a tiny bit  amp; 2 weeks in i lost all control and ate sugar whenever i wanted again. Its an addiction and i fully acknowledge that now. I dont have the control for occasional sweets. I might eventually allow myself something on rare occasions while out. But sugar doesn #8217;t come into my home ever again. Thats the only way i see myself lasting. But i felt so much healthier and was in so much less pain w migraines and constant joint pain when i was sugar free. Big motivation to get back there</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Good luck. It #8217;s such a hard craving to fight- even knowing how amazing the end result will be. My brain is so darn GOOD at convincing me to just have this one small thing, just this one time- and of course I #8217;ll be perfect tomorrow. Sigh. But I know it gets better. I got to where I had no cravings. One day I realized I hadn #8217;t had fruit in a couple days just because I hadn #8217;t thought of having anything sweet. I tried for a while making a chocolate that tasted ok sugar free but eventually I gave up and surprisingly enough my craving for that went away also. My headaches went from daily with several a week being migraines, to no daily headache and migraines only about once a month. The joint pain I put down to my physical job suddenly went away completely and I felt and moved like I hadn #8217;t for longer then I want to remember. It was life changing. Part of my struggle getting back on track was the depression and anger I #8217;ve had at the return of all my pain. But I #8217;m on track and I #8217;m determined to stay there. I hope you can hold on too.</TEXT>

I realized i was being stupid and now i dont touch anything unless 100% gluten free processing and everything. Been at it 9years now. There are so many more options all the time.

    <TEXT>I actually had enlarged liver. Kidneys that weren #8217;t working right. A white blood cell count that looked like cancer. I had to see these doctors yearly to monitor but they couldn #8217;t figure out what was up. Finally my gut got into the mix. After 4 months of running to the bathroom they found celiac. First symptoms at 16. Diagnoses at 32. After gluten free and eventually oat free too- my test came back in mostly normal range for the first time in several years. I also saw a dramatic reduction in my joint pain. I used to wear wrist braces at night and just attributed it to my job. But suddenly i didn #8217;t need the braces. I still deal w issues- especially w my kidneys. But overall im much better off gluten free. I honestly am not tempted by gluten anymore. Its literally not food in my mind. Makes that aspect a lot easier at least.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I always went over the top explaining when i was needing to shave a dog because of mats. Id hold my fingers the the width apart a 7 leaves and say the whole dog will be that length (any exceptions mentioned then- like if I thought i could save the tail or face. But i also specifically mention each body part getting shaved- legs, neck, chest, and especially always if face of tail cant be saved). Then i #8217;ld specifically say the dogs gonna look extremely different and would try to joke about it looking like a completely different dog. Anything to make EXTREMELY sure they understood 100% what i was planning even if they didnt like it. And i made sure i got affirming words back so i was sure they were actually listening and taking it in. Because people are idiots. I would still have issues but usually more like i got approval from one spouse but then another picked the dogs up and freaked. But overall my issues dropped a lot once I started doing that.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I pretty commonly tell people who bring it up that I didn #8217;t pick up because i was in the middle of something or just didn #8217;t feel like picking up at that moment. People are sometimes surprised and a few have tried to be offended but i keep it casual and just ask if they don #8217;t sometimes feel like not answering? Everyone feels like this sometimes so usually thats enough. If they try to say they always pick up- i just respond that i dont. Im not arguing. Im stating a fact. Sometimes I mention i wont be offended if they do the same. I also sometimes mention that i no im important to them even if they don #8217;t always pick up and that i #8217;ll always call back before too long. And i hope they #8217;ll do the same. I also have no ringtone for texts. I only see texts if i look at my phone. No noise. So people know they cant demand my attention with repeated texts and if they ask why i took a while to respond i say i dont have any tone for texts. If they say i should- i just tell them it was stressing me out. Ive never really had anyone push after that.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Yep. It varies but often mine dont sleep through consistently before 4-5 months. Have gotten it sooner (one pup i had was 100% potty trained and slept through the night by 9weeks) but each dog is different. Pick up water by 6 or so and try giving dinner by 4:30-5. Lets them clear out a lot of their business before bed so they have less at night. If they wake you up and seem thirsty i hold a bowl and let them take a few licks and try putting it away. If they #8217;re willing to settle then you can leave more water till morning.</TEXT>

Might be worth looking into https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/20061701/ Heres one of the links I investigated before i began taking it. Its for people- not dogs.

    <TEXT>Totally with you. I went sugar free a whole year. After about 4 months i stopped craving it all together. But then i started thinking i should have small amount. Surely I could control myself by now. Nope. I am a sugar addict. No denying now. I #8217;ve been struggling with sugar a few years now. Been determined to go completely sugar free again this last month. Most i got was 7 days then slipped. Now on day 3 again. Sigh. But i know from when i did it before- I need to not beat myself up and keep trying. Eventually i #8217;ll manage it. And next time im never bringing sugar into my house. Maybe eventually i #8217;ll have the occasional rare treat out at a restaurant- but i might not. I #8217;ll have to see how it goes. Keep trying. For me that sugar free year was amazing. My daily headaches went away and my migraines became maybe one a month. Joint ache went away. Weight maintenance became so much easier. The key for me was finding food that isn #8217;t sweet that i LOVE. Food i savor every time. This needs to become my treat instead of sugar. Good luck!</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I #8217;ve got big dogs and I have the same problem. Even toys that people claim the dogs chew on for weeks will ask my dogs maybe an hour. I use antlers. Those seem to hold up pretty well. But I will say unless they can get to the core of the antler they #8217;re not interested. So I have to get split antlers. You can buy them bulk by weight from Etsy. That #8217;s the cheapest I have found. Just look around and compare prices. Don #8217;t just go to a regular pet store and get them. It #8217;s so much money that way. Some of the Kong toys hold up. I love giving my dogs treat dispensing toys. The kind where they knock them around and kibe comes out. I use that to feed them instead of bowls. Most of those are pretty hearty and the dogs are usually more interested in the food than destroying the toy. Honestly these are probably one of the best things for keeping the dogs from chewing on things they shouldn #8217;t. You want stuff that can keep the dogs occupied as long as possible. Sometimes I get felt and make my own dog toys. This I do planning for them to destroy it. I #8217;ll just cut strips and weave tight braids with a couple of knots and toss them to dogs. Sometimes they last 10 minutes-sometimes they last an hour. But felt doesn #8217;t turn to string the way a lot of other material does so less worry about the dogs getting hurt with it. You could even buy or make your own felt snuffle pad. Dogs love rooting around for tiny pieces of kibble that you #8217;ve hidden in there. If you can find them- I give my dog raw marrow bones. Outside obviously. I take them straight out of the freezer and put one down for each dog. The ones I get are cut into only a few inches each. And it keeps them occupied for quite a while. Actually any frozen treat can keep them occupied for a little longer. Sometimes I even do things like put carrots or pieces of apple into the freezer and then give it to them. Can #8217;t think of anything else off the top of my head. But good luck. I know how hard it can be. I #8217;ve spent hundreds of dollars on toys that lasted minutes through the years</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I up my fat intake. Healthy fats. But if you look at food you #8217;ll notice that when a company makes something fat free or low fat- it means the sugar level goes way up. That #8217;s how they make up for the lack of taste when they take out the fat. Besides #8230; I don #8217;t know about you but I tend to eat less in general when I want sugar and I #8217;m denying myself. Sometimes it almost seems like my body would rather just eat nothing then to eat something that isn #8217;t sugar. I joke to my sister that my body acts like a spoiled toddler. But because of this upping my fat doesn #8217;t really seem to affect my weight. But it does make me feel a lot fuller. Also you can try some carb stuff. Sometimes I #8217;ll take a handful of plantain chips and the starchy carbs help with my body #8217;s want for sugar</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Absolutely does!!! A fun game is describing a migraine to someone who barely has even had a headache in their life. They get this uncomprehending look that I wish I could wear. More than once my mom has actually apologized that she can try to help me but she can #8217;t really understand. I #8217;ve always responded that I #8217;m glad she can #8217;t understand. Super awesome though- how you took control so quickly and started looking into triggers. I lived 2 decades with doctors denying i had migraines. They insisted they were sinus since i have chronic sinus issues. So i went along with it. Suffered. Its only been the last several yrs that I started taking care of myself. I insisted a doc consider i had migraine- he agreed to let me try sumatriptan and low  amp; behold for the first time EVER IN MY LIFE a headache went away. Then i started seeing what else i could do to help myself get rid of this pain. Screw doctors- i #8217;ll do it myself.</TEXT>

I just clipped off the extra and put some septic powder on the quick. You #8217;re gonna have to keep an eye on it because the quick is now exposed to whatever he #8217;s walking on. It can be uncomfortable and they can spend a lot of time licking at it and irritating things. But with my guy once I got that part off he was mostly fine and within a few days it was totally fine.

    <TEXT>American culture is such a mishmash of multiple world cultures anyway #8230; The only time I see an issue is when people stick to the restrictions of their former country. I had a friend who desperately wanted to just be a typical girl but her immigrant parents had planned for her to marry a boy back in the old country. Eventually she ran away and did everything she could to avoid that fate. I still consider her parents American. They are citizens. But if you come to america you best expect your kids to grow up considering their life their own. Doesn #8217;t mean people dont fall in line w their parents wishes. Most of us probably do to some extent. But when they aren #8217;t raised surrounded by people with the same expectations of them #8230; and when they see their different freedoms and expectations their friends live with #8230; It #8217;s a lot harder to keep them under control. The people who embrace that fit right in the best- even when they still fully embrace and treasure their own culture.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I don #8217;t know what that is and the picture isn #8217;t very clear for me to be able to tell. But I had great success with diatomaceous earth when i was dealing with an infestation of tons of super tiny knats. It #8217;s extremely messy because it #8217;s a dust. An extremely fine dust. It will get everywhere. I used a puffer thats made to work with it and spread it anywhere I thought would help. Windowsills. Under beds. Along baseboards. Diatomaceous earth is made from the ancient remains at crustaceans and shellfish. When bugs in encounter it it covers them in thousands of tiny cuts. They don #8217;t last very long after that. Cleaning up after it sucks. But it was the first thing that finally worked for me. I just left the stuff sitting around for a few days and tried to not be bothered by the dust everywhere. But for months I stopped having an issue. A few days ago I found a couple coming in through my window just creeping in along the slider on the bottom. They #8217;re so tiny they could fit I guess. I ran and got my puffer and spread the diatomaceous earth. Next morning the windowsill had dozens, maybe a few hundred dead in the dust. Even got two flies that were buzzing around. Haven #8217;t had any more problem. If you #8217;re willing to deal with the mess this might help. Good luck</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Why? Thats how i am. They #8217;ve seen me struggle with it. They know i really do try. They know it #8217;s something i dislike about myself but because they aren #8217;t asshole and they love me they let it go and dont make things even worse for me. Most people i know who run late hate it about themselves. Most have numerous tricks and things they do to try being on time. Sometimes i can do it if i aim to be like an hr early. But not always. It hasn #8217;t ruined my life or any major events. What would the opposite of enabling be? Criticizing me? Telling me to just stay home if i cant be on time? My friend and family love me enough to want me around even with my  #8216;flaw #8217;.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Mostly to do with import/export relations though even that has good and bad. I never thought it made sense that we didnt charge large tariffs to countries who imposed them on our items. If our item is competing with a similar local item but ours has a 10-20% tariff tacked on top- it #8217;s obvious which one most will purchase. Meanwhile their item- cheaper then our own since they dont pay the same wages and dont carry the same restrictions on pollution and whatnot our own manufactures must abide by- sell quite well in our country. So our companies lose on both fronts. The company can then- 1) pay their workers less (we cant compete with countries that pay their workers just dollars a day). 2)move the company to a place where they can get the same cheap labor. They can then send their item back to us at the competitive lower price- tariff free (or nearly). Yes the costs of goods might go up in the short term. But the long term benefits to me seem logical and obvious. By placing tariffs even on US owned companies shipping us items from their factories abroad- it rewards companies who stay here and pay american worker to manufacture for them. That #8217;s one- and like i said- lot of flaws. But despite the criticism its one thing i did like that he did. I #8217;ll have to think hard to come up with another though there were a few. Not much though. Mostly i hate what hes done. Plus he #8217;s already undone or weakened a lot of environmental protection laws so i dont really trust him to keep US companies as restricted on damaging the world around them as they have been. China is super polluted and a lot of that is their manufacturing companies. I dont want more land destroyed and water poisoned and people sickened in the name of a better economy.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>The point I #8217;m trying to make is that I can #8217;t seem to change it. I have done so many things to try to fix my problem with being on time. I honestly can #8217;t do it. I seem to have a terrible sense for how long anything is going to take me. Dressing #8230; Do I leave five minutes or half hour or an hour. My hair can take 5 min but some days more. And then all of a sudden I remember that the dog has to go out to pee. And oh by the way I didn #8217;t eat anything today. Gotta grab something. It just goes on like that. But I also know myself. So for the most important things in life for instance my own sister #8217;s wedding #8230; I rented a place right next to the event. And then even though her wedding wasn #8217;t until 11 I was ready by eight in the morning. That way anything that came up in the meantime I still had plenty of time. It #8217;s not sticking my head in the sand about how frustrating it can be for the people around me. It #8217;s just something that no matter how hard I have tried I #8217;ve never been able to fix. It #8217;s something that a lot of people can #8217;t seem to change. How would being cruel about it help anything. It certainly isn #8217;t going to get me on time Nobody #8217;s perfect. I #8217;m very sure that there are things you do that frustrate the people around you. Hopefully they #8217;re not spending their time criticizing you and trying to change you. Change has to come from within. And sometimes- to my great frustration- somethings just seem to win out over your attempts to be better. Ask any over weight person about this- the struggle is real</TEXT>

I dont want to think a diagnosis will solve anything- but looking at signs/symptoms and reading peoples accounts is like reading about my life. And some of the coping strategies ive seen are things i have come up with myself over the years to help myself. But now with resources of people who are experts in this or have been living it knowledgeably for years....i feel less like one person- alone and messed up- and more like maybe i just need to start thinking differently because im far from special and so many other people deal with this.

    <TEXT>I used to get grounded from reading. It was the only thing my parents could do that really made an impact on me. I would freak out. Still do- if u take away my access to reading. Its where i hide from the world. Everything is so uncomfortable and i can loose myself completely in a book. I can deal with the world better knowing i have the ability to read at anytime- so having a phone w tons of books downloaded is a great comfort to me. Even in school- i got mostly good grades but struggled with being bored out of my mind constantly. I brought 2-3 books w me to school. Then i would read my book in class as hidden as i could. I didn #8217;t understand why the teacher spent an hour talking about something I #8217;d already come to understand and beside- they mostly worked out of the book and I #8217;d read that already. If i missed the teachers sneaking up on me they would take my book and tell me to pay attention. So I would. Long enough for them to loose interest in me. Then i #8217;d pull out my next book. I never actually got caught w my second book but I normally had the third just in case.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>For me reading is life-long. Its my go-to escape from anything unpleasant. Next- my animals. I spend a lot of time interacting w them. Others come and go. Some for a few weeks (ive learned to keep my spending on new interests to a minimum until ive continued to be interested for a weeks. I #8217;ll often get a book on the subject. If i can slowly make my way through it [non-fiction is difficult for me. Unlike fiction] its more likely to be a lasting interest). Plants- both outside plants and inside. I occasionally put off care but not by much. Im interested enough to keep up with the watering and fertilizing and whatnot. Recently though that evolved into a fascination with bonsai. Ive read everything i could and after a few weeks got myself a ficus plant i #8217;ll try turning into a bonsai tree over NEXT FEW YEARS. We #8217;ll c how that goes though. Ive never developed an interest that requires so much patience and time before.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I leave on the kitchen lights. I am usually very good about shutting off lights and stuff so when I see the lights left on in the kitchen it reminds me that there was food somewhere that I would need to take care of in someway. Not the greatest for the electric bill maybe but it works better for me than alarms and things like that because I usually won #8217;t take the time to set them. Our kitchen light is also very bright so that trick even works during the day</TEXT>

    <TEXT>A week ago i wasn #8217;t feeling like dealing with the world and at the same time my nephews introduced me to Among Us. I played for about 22 hrs straight with a few small breaks for eating. Then crashed at 5:30am and slowly cycled through the extra everything i deal with when i dont get enough sleep. Now the game is dull. I pick it up expecting it to drag me in and it just....doesn #8217;t. Kind of a bummer but not unusual.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I finished my room the day before yesterday. I have 16 house plants that were sitting on the ground for over a month while i put it off. But finally i blasted music  amp; podcasts and divided the work into 3 days. Day one was going through my drawers, closet, shelves, and toss whats trash or not needed or just doesn #8217;t belong there (room was horrendous after this but those places were ready to have things put away. Day 2 was pick up. All the loose stuff up. Clothes in wash or put away. Trash in trash. Random crap into a pile and steadily put away. Sweep the floors of any loose little crap. Day three is detail clean. I scrubbed the windows, floors, ceiling fan, base boards. After all the other work id done this took about an hour so. You can possibly do it in one day and i know very well how hard it is to get going for one day let alone multiple. I have health issues and just can #8217;t do that much in one sitting. I also dont try to make myself work on one thing at a time. I just embrace the scatter. I empty part of one drawer, then notice some loose water bottles around and gather them for recycling, in there i snag a small garbage can to make things easier. I gather some laundry but then decide to tidy my bookshelf. It all gets done still but im less frustrated with it all and myself when i just go with it Anyway- good luck!!</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I don #8217;t think you #8217;ll usually see this tip so take it for what it is but with my daith piercings refused to heal and kept having issues even six months after I got them- I started dabbing them with manuka honey. Within days any sign of infection was gone and it healed and I never had an issue again. I had tried everything my piercer recommended and I had tried what other people recommended including my doctor. Other than I refused to take out the piercing. This is the only piercing I #8217;ve had to do this with because all my others healed very easily. But if I have issues in the future I hundred percent plan to use the honey again. It worked too well for me not to</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Pretty much. Id put some on and rotate my piercing so it coated everything. I let it sit for as long as i could the first couple days. Id put on enough it wouldn #8217;t dry for a while. Then rinse it away with warm water (sometimes shower sometimes just a warm cloth. Then re-apply. I had to work and stuff so i just did it when i was home. After the first couple days it looks a ton better and then i just put some on morning and evening for a few weeks. I stopped originally after the first week because it looked so good but then the bump and discomfort started coming back so i did it heavy for a day and after that just kept it up probably a month. Never needed to again after that. I no this is unusual but i so didnt want to take them out and i was running out of options.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Any brand with a UMF rating of 15 or more (I always just get 15 because higher rating cost lot more and 15 always works for me). UMF means the honey was independently tested and certified. They literally put a drop on honey on a bacteria covered petri dish and rate it by how much of the bacteria die. I used happy valley for years but their prices recently went way up. I ordered https://smile.amazon.com/gp/aw/d/B07DBXN4R5?ref=ppx_pt2_mob_b_prod_image amp;th=1 amp;psc=1 this one yesterday because im low. Still not cheap but neither are piercing. Plus one container this size last me a LONG time. Hope you find success one way or another. I know how disappointing and frustrating it can be dealing with this</TEXT>

But if you cut out too much and your numbers improve how will you know what did it? How will you know what is safe to reintroduce. I jumped in to AIP and then struggled bad figuring out what I could bring back into my diet (the broader the diet the easier to get all the nutrients you need)</TEXT>
