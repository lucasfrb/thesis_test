    <TEXT>'''  gt;I tend to believe that liberal democracy is a strong enough idea that it can survive open criticism. Considering the growing threat of rightwing extremism, which has been facilitated by uninhibited and unrestricted so called free speech, you're wrong. The Paradox of Tolerance is proof that unlimited tolerance leads to the destruction of tolerant society, and that in order to preserve tolerant society we must censor views and beliefs that threaten tolerant society when they pose a threat to tolerance.  gt;The suppression of speech is the tool of the tyrant who, recognizing that another ideology is better than his own, persists in his ideology and suppresses all others. It is the currency of Nazi's and Soviets, not free peoples of the world. I like the part where you conveniently ignore how the Allies censored the Nazis and prohibited them from spreading their beliefs. People like you think rightwing extremists should be permitted to promote their ideologies and ignore the fact they are becoming a growing problem.

    <TEXT>'''  gt;you do know Russia and Germany were allies too right? Molotov-Ribbentrop Pact wasn't an alliance, it was a non-aggression pact with some agreements in the direction of their mutual interest, such as dividing up Poland. Stalin planned to intervene in the Sudetenland crisis by sending in a million troops if Britain and France didn't do their part. It was a delaying tactic on the Soviet's part because their army was woefully inadequate for fighting a modern war, as proven by their disastrous offensive into Finland in the winter of 1939, and Germany planned to nullify France and Britain before looking East.  gt;Then holy crap wouldn't ya know it, Germany attacked the "incompetent Stalin" and lead to the single greatest loss of human life in recorded history Except they weren't allies and the Nazis were staunchly anti-Communist, yes, even while the non-aggression pact was in effect. As was Italy. As was Japan. If you think the Soviets were part of the Axis, I, again, have to question your degree.  gt;but yeah they were allies and of course Hitler had no intention of world domination, genocide, extermination, and the final solution. He outlined his intentions in Mein Kempf, he always intended to expand Eastwards. The idea of needing Lebensraum existed in Germany for decades, they planned to emulate the other empires with a land empire instead of a sea empire. Even the Kaiserriech intended to use Ukraine like this after Brest-Litovsk.  gt;Everybody was still going to be free to speak their own language, have their own beliefs, culture, and so on in a German world. Oh I never said this, just that Germany never imposed their language or culture on territory they didn't plan to incorporate into their nation. They didn't do this in France, the Channels Islands, Norway or anywhere their occupation was ostensibly "for the duration."  gt;You're also clearly aware that Hitler made the exact same comments about Mussolini being incompetent. He commissioned a commando raid to free him from imprisonment. While he was absolutely incompetent, Hitler saw value in having an aligned state on his southern border, and in Mussolini being at least a figurehead for that state.  gt;But judging by his track record with his friends, he'd never dream of attacking his allies and making them adopt Aryan culture, changing city names, destroying conflicting history, or flat out erasing them altogether. As awful as Hitler was, no. He didn't do that. The Soviet Union wasn't an ally. If you think this, you're grossly in error.  gt;I'm saying this part as politely as I can, you're out of your league on this subject. You had it right the first time. And it shows.  gt;but Germany and Hitler fully intend to conquer the world, rewrite history, and make every living human being submit to Aryan culture. Citation needed, buddy. He planned to commit horrific acts of genocide and enact a brutal colonization of Eastern Europe, but I think you're taking your cues from Wolfenstein.  gt;Russia (Germany's ally, don't forget) (They weren't an ally. They never joined the Pact of Steel or the Axis Powers.)  gt;defeat them if not for German forces fighting on the Western front and needing to commit resources to two fronts. The war was won after Stalingrad. In fact, I'd say the war was won when Germany failed to seize Moscow in the winter of 1941.  gt;That being said... you're familiar with geography and know where Italy is right? Russia would have never reached Italy. Right there next to Austria. Which uh, the USSR reached.  gt;If Germany was able to commit more ground troops and Panzer divisions to the Eastern front, the Red Army wouldn't have even made it to Poland let alone taken back Stalingrad. Germany already had the vast majority of their forces on the Eastern Front, those that weren't committed were third string reserve forces to occupy Western Europe, or a small force in Africa. Germany didn't have the ability to conquer as much territory as it needed as quickly as it needed, they weren't mechanized enough, they didn't have enough oil, and the USSR could outbuild them, their industry dwarfed Germany's.  gt;The Luftwaffe and minimum ground/Panzer troops would have easily held the Western front. Like in real life?  gt;ITALY would be speaking German in 2020 had the US not been physically been drawn into the war. Despite no precedence for that.  gt;Bottom line dude. Bottom line is your degree must be in fingerpainting. You're trying to speak as an authority when you can't even get the fundamentals right. If you really do have a degree in history I'm a little shocked.

Both of these assumptions let you feel a sense of superiority without needing to worry about having your beliefs challenged or put any effort into learning about what is happening. There's a part of me that sympathizes with this approach, and I'm not saying this lightly. It's legitimately stressful to give a shit, and it means preparing yourself to be disappointed in countless ways, from the failings of the people you support to the failings of your neighbors for failing to see what you see.

Royal Mail's website suggests that postcards count under the same umbrella as 'letters' and are thus the same cost (starting at  #163;1.26). I was wondering if I would save money using actual stamps, or even if using stamps is a possibility at all, rather than going in the store and sending off my mail. I will likely be sending 2-3 per month. If it is possible to buy and use stamps, which should I be buying? [[link]^^2 With thanks! ''' [Sending postcards to Canada...

    <TEXT>''' Not to rain on the hate parade. But a lot of places that were "spared" early on are now getting hit hard. I think it's a combination of simply being tired, and also being out of touch with the seriousness of the virus. This is actually happening in regions that did really well with the virus the first time around. Take a look at the rates in Germany and Czech Republic, who were considered model countries in the West for their early response. They're both getting absolutely fucked at the moment. Their spike is actually quite similar to ND's. Another thing that nobody really wants to think about, is that ND is the coldest state in the mainland US. That means "winter" (what you'd consider winter in most of the South) has been there for about a month now. More people inside means more cases. This could very well be a harbinger of what's to come for the rest of the US in coming months. Are there a lot of dumbshits? Sure. Of course. But I think there's more to the story than that unfortunately. My prediction is as Winter comes, the cases are going to spike across all of the US again. We're going for Round 4, and if you look at how Europe is handling it, it's far worse than even the initial surge in cases. Europe is also in the "meh" stage of the virus as well. At a certain point, people literally just stop, and we're at that point.

    <TEXT>''' The terms up north and down south are inaccurate and I don't know if it's just me. Am I the only person that this pisses off? If you travel North to Scotland from England you haven't travelled "Up North." You've travelled North and only North. "Up." Implies altitude. I know this is a bit of a pedantic statement but I mentioned it in the pub and have been continuously told I'm wrong, and that North is up. I understand that saying up North or down South in language is quite commonly acceptable but when I pointed out it's wrong I just got berated. This isn't me trying to flex intelligence, I just want to see if there're likeminded people it pisses off.

    <TEXT>''' The books were made by monks, for monks, or upon request of the nobility. They were hand made during months, so when a village could afford a Bible, it was indeed their treasure. When a peasant showed interest in sciences, the only way to get free studies was join the clerical institution. They were simply the only people interested in keeping knowledge for the sake of knowing, and accepting peasants among the scholars. Once again, they didn't block anything, they were simply the only option available. Note : please notice that I didn't mention any religion in particular, since that's the case in nearly every religion. If you have anything better than quick empty statements in absolute terms, I will gladly keep on debating. Ironically, this is the key point of the protest against Hate speech from those who are in absolute unnegotiable maximal positions. Aren't we better? Otherwise, best regards.

    <TEXT>''' Funny how you #8217;re not allowed to draw a picture of Mohammed, but muslims recognize him on said picture. How do they know what the dude looked like if you weren #8217;t allowed to draw pictures of him? If I draw a stickman with a beard and name it Mohammed, is it the same thing? I #8217;d also like to think that drawing pictures of Mohammed being  #8221;illegal #8221; is a rule for muslims and not people of other beliefs. Seems irrational that a christian or buddhist has to follow islam rules but the other way around isn #8217;t necessary. Cows are holy within hinduism, thus you are not allowed to harm them, let alone eat them and I #8217;m pretty sure muslims do eat cows. I #8217;d say  #8221;practice what you preach #8221; but religious people aren #8217;t strangers to being hypocrites and logic isn #8217;t their strong suit anyway. Islam seems to be the most snowflakey religion these days. From patch 19.50 up until 20.00 it used to be christians, but around patch 20.00 they understood that they had to adapt to the metagame. There are still christians stuck on old patch nostalgia, but they #8217;re pretty irrelevant and nobody cares about them.

    <TEXT>'''  gt; Thus, it is widely accepted that polygyny was not the only type of matrimony practiced during the jahiliyya (pre-Islamic era), but one part of a highly variegated and diverse pool of matrimony types.  gt; Noteworthy was the fact that it was customary for men to marry women without limit, a practice that ended with the advent of the Qur'an and its divine revelation. It was common in jahiliyya Arabia for there to be no restriction on the number of wives a man could have. Often, tribal leadership tended toward polygynous marriages with the express purpose of establishing relationships with other powerful families, effectively injecting the practice of marriage with a political purpose. So according to wiki, preislamic marriages were pretty much all over the place, and polygynous marriages existed. Considering that Khadija most likely accepted Muhammad prophethood and considering that she was a powerful woman (meaning that she also understood how politics worked at the time) she most likely would have had no real reasons to oppose to polygynous relationships. I mean maybe she would (because she probably loved him) but not because it wasn't culturally accepted at the time. Funny how ultimately Islam borrows so much from preislamic traditions, it just codifies the whole thing.

    <TEXT>''' Contrary to the common belief, religion turned towards retrograde attitudes recently, soon after the industrial revolution and the adventure of the scientific method. In the middle ages religion was the only access to culture, that's why the Bible, Torah, Qran where called THE Book, it was literally the only book available. It preserved oral tradition, customs and laws. Problem comes when peasants got access to better sources, and that book was not longer the reference for everything, so the clerics lost part of their influence, so religion entered in self defence mode, creating irrational zealots. So here you have the bottom line, they are weak and their religion is threatened by our free speech and freedom of choosing away from their book. We are winning.

But this is a post about a depiction of Mohammed that's simply a historical tidbit, and imo not needless provocation. It doesn't appear to have been posted maliciously, if a little tongue in cheek at current events. OP even knows the history of the Abbot in charge of writing Mohammed in the 1140s, and has explained why he would have been drawn this way. I've seen lots of shit post comments in this thread, but nothing mean from OP. That's cool! I love history! And I'll stand by what I said tbf, if not to bring it up after an religious extremist attack, then when? One should expect consequences to their actions, yes. The discussion to be had here is about that very fact. The discussion would question whether a consequence to being blasphemous about a religion should cause one's life to become in danger, and whether that is something that should be accepted.

    <TEXT>''' For almost twenty years we have had these attacks. After every attack there is one of these pathetic demonstrations, but nothing changes and the attacks continue. If the state is not prepared to defend people from attacks by religious fanatics, then the people will have to protect themselves. The people are scared and intimidated by this religion, and feel that they are unable to criticise it, even though it causes intense negative feelings by the actions of its adherents. The media and the commentariat meanwhile, insist that the trouble is not to be found among the doctrines of the religion itself, but must be due to some other complicated reason, violating common sense and the principle of parsimony which underlies good logic.

What about the MASS COLLECTIVE acts of western terrorism for the past century? What should the Middle East say when the west came in heavy loaded with guns blazing and ended up murdering MILLIONS of its innocent civilians? Hmmm? What do you think middle eastern people were saying then? Too bad they couldnt do a damn thing about it but try their best and fight off western terrorism while being called terrorists for defending themselves on their own homelands. I recall speaking to westerners and asking them why they shot at afghan and Iraqi children and they would tell me,  #8220;because they had a weapon and fired at us so they are terrorists and we gotta protect our homeboys #8221;. How the fuck? Those kids were on their own soil watching these soldiers bomb their loved ones to oblivion, did they expect a hug? Look in the mirror.

    <TEXT>''' No you don't. Here's another example. You said they want to completely get rid of all healthcare. Where do you learn that from? Because they don't want to dismantle healthcare they simply don't want it to be undwr the government but i guess your varied mews sources all echo the same thing huh. And about people getting offended cry me a river alright. Getting offended by something of your own doing not someone else's. The black people you're talking about who get offended are part of that southern culture and goto church with them. They're a part of those friends you're so willing to judge as disgusting. If I was CNN I might just come up with a headline that says you just called all those black people disgisting and you're a racist. But again, I guess as someone whose entire self righteous view of society is based on broad generalisations and not ground reality... Southern states are more diverse than the rest of America that is teaching them how not to be racist. Just look at a map. Several counties in the south have more hispanics and blacks than white. Democrats fuel this victim mentality for their gain. And before you jump to more conclusions, no, I'm not saying racism doesn't exist at all. It does, and those "flag flying racists" as you would rather judge them agree as well. But again, you don't want to know that fo you why bother when you can just claim to be morally superior and label them as the villains. And as the critical race theory being taught in American institutions suggests, me having a brown skin gives me a moral high ground against a white person when it comes to topics regarding racism. So make of that what you will.

Aka much bigger things are going on, nobody cares if one asshole punched another asshole in the mouth.

    <TEXT>''' I can't see the downvotes (score is hidden) but you're right. Fauci initially said Americans don't need to wear masks but later went on to say Americans should be wearing masks. I wish accurate information like this wasn't so unpopular. It's important that people understand the timeline of COVID-19 and various peoples' initial responses as well as their current responses. Bob Woodward's book Rage is an excellent resource for that. I upvoted your comment by the way. Nobody fucking reads books anymore and it pisses me off. It's impossible to expect to be informed by just reading reddit and watching major media outlets' overly compressed news segments. Books are so damn undervalued...

    <TEXT>''' What are you saying should happen? What is the prescription to this problem? Have 50/50 posts about positive/negatives stories about democrats and republicans? Such a task would probably require an honor system or sophisticated bot moderation. How would you deal with the fact that most users would probably downvote the positive republican and negative democrat posts? The same problem still arises. Whenever republicans raise this issue, it ignores the fact that the vast majority of the internet is liberal due to the inherent fact that conservatism is mostly popular amongst the older generation which are less likely to use the internet and the younger generation is more liberal/progressive which use the internet at much higher rates. Conservative online forums can only survive with stringent moderation, is that a direction you'd like to head? Because that's a laughable solution, it would just mean different online forums are created and the old forum is just abandoned to be left with only conservatives and maybe some token liberals.

I do NOT need the governments permission or blessing to run a SP Sole Proprietorship (like I current in fact do) The bakery does not need the governments permission to exist. you are confusing operating rules (zoning, health codes, taxes etc..) with PERMISSION and ENFORCEMENT (corporations) and the grant of personhood. One CONSEQUENCE of our over enforcement and encroachment on the rights of individuals is "permission for everything" and this is where you confusion is coming from. I am struggling with nothing. this is not even remotely difficult or even vaguely hard for me to understand. this is such a very simple concept to me that the only struggle I experience is wondering WHY Its not computing in your mind. That is beyond baffling to me. When they EXPLOIT they stop being capitalists. why is this fucking concept so hard for you to grasp? and yes the STATE does in fact need to enforce it. this is part of what "provide for the common good" means in the constitution. The government is tasked with enforcing a free market to make sure capitalist do not BECOME cronies and exploiters. this is why we SHOULD have minimum wage. because when capitalism goes "bad" and becomes something else (like we have today) the citizens suffer. What your brain for some reason is having trouble understanding is that when these people do bad they STOP BEING CAPITALISTS Criminals are bad people. they WERE Good Citizens. they STOP BEING good citizens when they become criminals. YOUR addled mind is equating this to meaning Good citizens = Criminals because all criminals COME FROM good citizens when .... they stop being good citizens. The same applies here. Your mom's bakery is just capitalism. when she has ten bakeries and starts to have input into local legislators and starts to interfere with other bakeries starting up to prevent competition to her bakeries. SHE IS NOT A CAPITALIST ANY LONGER. WHY is this exceedingly simple concept hard for you to crasp?

    <TEXT>''' India has always been trash, first Indian people suck donkey balls still extremely superstitious, extremely religious, acts like there is no caste but deep inside all fuckers are proud of caste or hold a grudge against upper caste. Middle class in India pays all taxes, rich is well protected and poor people are also taken care by middle class. What is so bad about Modi government? I infact find more opportunities in this government. This government is very supportive of business. Gone are the days people rotting away in govt offices. Extreme left and right are always trash all across the world. If you have a good education then this government is good, else it's trash. Rape cases are always made political no matter what for votes, they don't give a fuck. UP, Haryana, Bihar needs military rule and shoot at sight. Those two states have veen causing a lot of issues, filled bandits, gangs and criminals who have no fear.

If we had a better president, a less petty president, then we all would have stimulus checks by now. They wanted to give people more money, more than 1.8 trillion.

So in 99% of cases, its completely BS that disabled people can't work. I fully support helping those that really can't work. They do often times get welfare + disability and other kinds of benefits.  gt; I've supported UBI for a long time though and had no intention of stopping work even if it had passed, though I might've worked for a different company. You just claimed you can't work. Which is it? Crazy ideas in the past have made the poor people poorer and destroyed the middle class. This will only continue destroying it and making people that work even poorer with significantly higher taxes. You seem to only be able to see the benefits and don't think about the cons like many people.  gt; Taxpayers are the ones that benefit from it. That's like saying that healthcare and roads are a burden. This is the most absurd thing I've ever heard. How do I benefit from significantly higher taxes? How do people living paycheck to paycheck benefit from it when their taxes will go up?

Did you know that, even with shutting down economies over the country for more than half of a year, 210,000 Americans have already died? Can you imagine that perhaps the number would be greater if we had not shut down? There #8217;s many ways to make social distancing in schools work, depending on the size of the premises and classes and local infection. Anyone with a well functioning in person schooling situation is fortunate for this, and it #8217;s the aspiration of every school district.

    <TEXT>''' lol this comment by /u/TunedMassDamsel  gt;Hi.  gt;My name's Amy, I'm a licensed professional engineer. I'm the only one in the state of Texas who'll touch ISBUs and make habitable structures out of them. Google "Numen Development," that's my client. ISBUs are what shipping containers are actually called. I structurally design shipping container houses. My day job is as a forensic structural engineer. I investigate structural failures and write reports and testify in court as to why structures fail. I have eleven years' experience, a masters degree in structural engineering from the University of Illinois, and I'm an adjunct professor of structural analysis and design at a local university where I live.  gt;I am uniquely qualified to tell you why this is a raging death trap from the perspective of structural adequacy.  gt;I'd like to draw your attention to a few things here, if I may... Others have already mentioned the fact that you were digging without any trench safety protocols, and the fact that you're going to be reported to the fire marshal and your municipality for failing to get a permit or follow code requirements, and the fact that this is a confined entry situation that you need a prior permit to enter, so I won't belabor those points, but I will expound on a few other things.  gt;1) The strength of an ISBU is in the rails. The walls have virtually no strength, as you discovered when you piled a mere foot and a half of soil on top of the structure and observed massive amounts of deflection in the walls. You think that you've circumvented this problem by attaching horizontal rails to the exterior walls, but the way in which you've attached the rails sets yourself up for localized buckling of the angle legs at each attachment point. I ran some quick calcs, because essentially what you're doing is creating an underground retaining wall. What you have is woefully insufficient for a saturated condition. If you get the right amount of rain, you'll end up crushing yourself.  gt;2) Also, buoyancy. If you get the different right amount of rain, you'll end up buoying the whole thing right up out of the ground. This is actually a problem we have with empty swimming pools in flood conditions. Yours will do the same thing for the same reasons.  gt;3) The thing I spend a lot of time explaining to crazy people is the following graph: [link]^^1 As temperature increases (for instance, in a fire condition), the elasticity of steel increases greatly and the yield strength plummets. While it's nice to contemplate whether or not you'd be able to survive the climb up and out of the bunker in the event of a fire, it really doesn't matter, because you've just taken all the strength out of your retaining wall and it has caved in and crushed you to death. Unfortunate.  gt;(EDIT: Upon further reflection, you'd probably suffocate first, and the soil appeared pretty clayey, so if the ground isn't saturated, there might not be a fire-induced cave-in. Not a bet I'd care to take, though.)  gt;4) I think it's really sweet that you think coating the exterior of the ISBU in a waterproof coating will stave off corrosion. You can encase steel in a two-inch thick concrete shell and it will still find a way to corrode. You do not put steel structures underground. You do not put steel structures underground. You do not put steel structures underground.  gt;(EDIT: At least not without cathodic protection.)  gt;I'm interested to see the mechanism by which this fails horribly. Please keep us posted, and please inform the executor of your estate that if you're in the bunker when it fails, that they should come back and send us a link to the related news article so that we may all learn from your experiences.

    <TEXT>''' ##[Donald Trump reiterates desire to murder terrorists' families. Donald Trump on US military:]^^1  gt;'They won #8217;t refuse, they #8217;re not going to refuse me  #8212; believe me' The GOP/Republican party in near unanimity failed to denounce him. They didn't chastise, walk-back, andor denounce an objectively and utterly uncivilized, monstrous proclamation. A proclamation made on national television. Then reiterated in a debate. Then, re-re-iterated at a rally. In fact, he was supported, nominated, and elected by the establishment and followers - who ignored such a blatant and naked disregard for basic human rights and compassion, as well as international law codified throughout the decades, if not millennia. That's evil if there is such a thing. *Spiritually to economically to human rights to basic governance, such an assertion and failure to condemn is, literally, uncivilized and monstrous. It is the antithesis to humanity's basic survival and ability to thrive.* If you want to talk strict governance and throw all semblance of decency and humanity out the window and pretend it or crimes against humanity don't exist, here's recent voting history here comparing the two parties to [decide for yourself who has more standing when it comes to legitimate and honest governance]^^2 .

    <TEXT>''' First and foremost, I don't believe in using rhetorical questions as a literary device even if they are one, so the questions I put are actual questions. Your comment is one of the largest misdirections I have ever seen on this subreddit. Fauci is clearly not allowed to say anything because as he said himself, his avenues of public communication are highly restricted. Popular shows that he decided not to mention by name have the broadcasting power to allow him to speak freely and yet he's restricted, even though he's among the most important health advisors there is - so Fauci is CLEARLY contained and it's quite frankly not possible to argue otherwise. He has support for the people already, but the WH is not allowing him to appear on the many shows that have requested for him to speak. And the one time he does get public appearance on 60 Minutes here with LaPook, you're telling me that he has nothing to fear i.e. bulletproof. That's a blatant lie. Fauci cannot say whatever he wants, his freedom is being highly restricted. This conversation is headed a certain direction moderated by the host. Can you see how they're reacting? Can you see how excited LaPook gets when Fauci talks about how "disrespecting science is like disrespecting authority?" And Fauci is saying "yeah but Trump is probably just making a statement saying that we're strong and we're gonna get through this - literally what Trump's autistic echolalia has been chanting on Twitter for eons. Yeah I'll let you make your own conclusions. From this video alone, Fauci is unable to say what he wants to say because he's talking about how he wants to say certain things. His expressions say he wants to talk but can't. We think he has the ability to speak openly, but he doesn't. Look at how beloved Fauci is protecting Trump by shifting every attack towards him by the host of that show into ways that defend him instead. It's very easy to see this especially halfway through the video. Fauci is more upset at the fact federal agents are following him everywhere than the death threats he's received towards his family. What does this say about everything I said?

    <TEXT>'''  gt; Why is she refusing to allow the stimulus checks to go out if not for political reasons? The same way you make your kids eat broccoli and corn and not just pie and cupcakes. The checks look great, and sure, they buy Trump some votes, but they don't actually do anything to solve the problems or keep unemployed people afloat. To actually help the country, you need the unpleasant stuff, like unemployment support. But that's expensive, and rich GOP donors don't want all that money to go out without them getting most of it (again) so the GOP stands in the way of it. Read something besides Fox News. This information is all over the place. You're focused on the checks because you're selfish and small minded. $1200 won't do you much good if the economy collapses. Take the blinders off.

    <TEXT>''' I've read in a school where Ramayan and Mahabharata were taught as a separate subject named 'Indian Culture', I have had the opportunity of reading our ancient texts in vernacular language. While it was not not technically a text for moral upliftment (characters were deified to some extent), I still regard them high as our ancient teachings and continually gain wisdom that was imparted thousands of years back. While in school I regarded it as just another subject, I understand now what it has done to me as a human being. It has shaped my values and principles to some extent and I continue to draw inspirations from them. A few days back, I was talking to my convent educated gf, while talking she mentioned she never had to read the sacred books and she doesn't know any of it. It came to me as a surprise but from the school I come from it was not the case and I have always had friends who know the basic teachings and storyline of Ramayana and Mahabharata. So it bothers me, should we include it as a subject of moral teachings stripped of its religious connotations or would that be of no use?

It will cause all nations around it to either submit to China's demands or build up their own militaries. Japan has already started building up it's military in response to increasing Chinese power. When multiple states need to build up their military we get a repeat of the arms race pre-WWI and increasing tensions. We don't even need to look that far back though - as recently as the 80's we had a nerve-wracking nuclear arms race with the Soviet Union that only ended once the communist state imploded due to the pressure.

    <TEXT>'''  gt;I'm a voluntarist. So a fancy word that means libertarian? Whatever bud.  gt;I'm extremely anti-authoritarian. Supporting laws so not every mentally ill person can own an AK is not authoritarianism. Parading around state capitals with guns and threatening anti-gun activists IS authoritarianism. IMO the 2A people are the authoritarians of our time, not just trump. They don't move an inch, and it makes me HATE them.  gt; I don't care what you want to do, as long as you don't harm others or violate their **property rights**. Property rights? Oh word? Like the McCloskeys love so much? The obsession with property is a dead giveaway for rightwing bullshit. Minarchism is an idea of government that is useful for only small children and the mentally deficient, as it is viewed only from the perspective of what it can do for the minarchist. They don't care what happens to other people; anti-government folks in general have a worldview of "I've got mine, fuck you". It is a very selfish view of the world and is often associated with antisocial personalities.  gt;Fuck gun laws. Fuck gun nuts and their fetish for murder toys.  gt; I don't know if you're aware of this, but there's more to it than Republican and Democrat. Pro-2A with no exceptions means authoritarian asshole. Anything otherwise is a fucking lie.  gt;Please, though, tell me again how I'm far right. See the above. Libertarianism/voluntarianism is an excuse for people who want the poor and minorities to die in the street.  gt;More like do-whatever-you-want-and-leave-me-alone-ism, but okay No, it's another excuse for being a libertarian.  gt;Here's a handy guide to determine if something is authoritarianism: Ah some cool bullshit is coming.  gt;Did a governing body do it?  gt;Yes --- gt; Authoritarianism  gt;No --- gt; Not authoritarianism I would say a lot of the terrible shit that megacorporations do is authoritarian in nature, but whatever, let's demonize countries instead of assclowns who sell out their workers.  gt;No. Parading around is doing exactly that, parading around. Once you make threats, you cross the line, but standing while armed isn't a threat. Parading around intimidates others. It's obvious fucking authoritarianism: "do what we want and let us have no restrictions on guns or we will kill you with our guns". It's so heavily implied that I laughed my ass off reading the above comment.  gt;"People who support less government intervention are authoritarians, the government isn't" The government protects people FROM assholes. I love the idea of government. They are beholden to the people. Corporations just want to fuck people.  gt;I'm going to let you think on that one, chief. Government intervention protects the vulnerable from bad actors. Not everyone can be a rugged individualist with a warped sense of masculinity.  gt;Not a minarchist. Minarchy requires a state. Voluntarism doesn't. Without a state there wouldn't be roads, food or computers. The state is a good thing. People who want to rip it down only want to enrich themselves or make others die.  gt; #129335; #8205; #9794; #65039; That's the best I can do. It's real shit.  gt;Again, supporting the government staying the fuck away from gun rights is not an authoritarian position. YES IT IS. It means people like me who don't want have anything to do with guns have to deal with some inbred loser who has access to firearms. By not moving an inch that is authoritarianism. If you want people to start a movement towards repealing 2A like we did slavery, then by all means continue to refuse to change.  gt;Telling the government to fuck off and leave you alone is not authoritarian. Screaming like little children and pointing guns at people in favor of gun control is authoritarian.  gt;No, and no. Cope harder, statist. Those who hate the state should live in the wilderness, without internet, and fuck off from the rest of us.

As you just admitted? Also what you searched is not even what I mentioned. You changed Clinton to Rodham and added in committee. I already said that the Google results debunk conspiracy theories about her being fired. So obviously I have seen the results. What part of what I said was wrong? What part of what I said was a conspiracy? As you said it's not a conspiracy, so then how is me mentioning it make it a conspiracy theory? You're completely lost on this one.

    <TEXT>''' only 28% ?? **I dont believe this for one second**. I am pretty sure a higher percentage would vote for trump. The reasons are many 1. Huge amounts of racism, if you think racism is bad here, go to India. Lot of Indian's think poorly of the BLM movement and this itself would cause them to vote for trump. 2. A lot of these guys moved several years ago and are huge fans of trumps anti immigrant focus since they have already crossed the bridge and they dont want any more of the "other kind" coming over 3. Taxes - a lot of these guys not surprisingly are in tech and have high salaries, they would love the lower taxes since it helps them the most (granted not all are the 1 percenters but a significant number do have high pay checks) 4. Anti muslim crowd -Trump has huge support due to his anti muslim focus and a lot of people focus him for that 5. Evangelical Indian christians - A lot of evangelical Indian christians I knew after trumps election in 2020 were super giddy about his anti LGBTQ focus and were delirious with joy with the hope he is going to make it a christian nation again. I am not still sure of their views since i kicked them off my friends list when they kept on posting pro trump posts coupled with christian proverbs, but I am still sure lot of them are delighted about the potential of Amy Barrett's nomination to the court and thats a huge incentive to them. Take this 72% news with a huge grain of salt..I hope I am totally wrong but this seems hard to believe..

    <TEXT>''' Yeah 65+ people don't really matter to me. 52% of my taxes go to pensions, the retirement centers are overcrowded and not affordable. They don't spend their savings and those funds could be used much more liquid by their heirs. Meanwhile we have to destroy 1/3 of our economy and get denied basic liberties (what the fuck does it matter if I drive my car from my bubble to my house after 12 at night?) while my age group has less than 1% chance of dying. It's always: "have some compassion", "think about that particular age category", "imagine the dying people". Fuck that, no one has compassion with me when I'm dealing with hardships trying to earn enough money for the state to waste over and over again.

    <TEXT>''' So this is a curiosity that I'd come across. I read a horrible story about this boy named Andrew Frankish who committed a terrible act of animal cruelty that I won't describe here. After serving his time (like 21 days!!! not enough) in jail he was allowed to change his name, which he changed to Liam Andrew White. His brother (who filmed it) and his mother changed their names and in both those cases as well their original first name became their middle name. It's not just this family either I think another criminal born with initials JV changed his name and moved his first name to the middle (there's a chance i'd be breaking the law if i elaborate further). Seems like a stupid idea if you're trying to avoid being found. So my question is when changing your name is it legally obligated to keep your first name somewhere in there? Or are these people just idiots? This isn't that big a deal but it's been bugging me for about a year now and I figured I'd just ask it here in case anyone knows.

    <TEXT>''' Gandhi was a politician (No problem in that). Godse killing Gandhi was without a dispute a gruesome act. Doesn't make Gandhi a saint though. I know Gandhi is considered as saint outside India but he was a human who had his own flaws and faults. He never raised his voice for Bhagat Singh when he was being hanged. He allowed his wife to die instead of letting her take penicillin (This is contended by many as act of love - and hence it is debatable). He had his stupid celibacy tests. He backed Nehru instead of Patel as first PM of India. All these points are open to debate i understand - but doesn't mean we don't question what is the current narrative of Gandhi. Also Gandhi allowed partition of India which was also a reason of his assassination and not just because he was secular.

I mean if you can quote just about any religion freely don't you technically have freedom of speech? From what I've seen they'll let anyone go who's quoting a religious text. Has any group misused this in any way? Do you have the hate groups going around quoting dead religions or anything? Also what is your take on the whole thing?

My entire career in the military I worked with very intelligent people, a vast majority scoring in the 90s on their ASVAB, some even perfect scores of 99. Don't blame them for not taking you. The military assuredly wants intelligent people because we solve their problems for cheaper than hiring consultants and contractors. Who do you think operates the nuclear reactors on submarines? Who does all the complex intelligence collection and analysis all over the military? I'm sorry for all of your mental health issues, but playing the victim, blaming the military, and claiming it's because we don't want highly intelligent people is extremely offensive. You clearly had other mitigating factors that limited you from enlisting, I assure you it was not because you scored too high on your ASVAB.

Our economy is stacked against us and Millennials and Gen Z both know it. I just roll my eyes at every tired and pseudo-intellectual argument I hear about how we've got it so good. They're arguing in bad faith, all they want to do is jerk themselves off about how THEY'RE the hardworkers. Go fuck yourselves. Young people work their asses off to make ends meet in ways the Boomers never had to. This is coming from someone who was poor all through his twenties and worked his way up to making 6 figures by early thirties too. I think it's disgusting that young people have had to inherit an economy of debt and austerity.

They stood by her as she tried to ban MAS from running, chased many of the leaders out of the country, imposed martial law, and pushed elections back. They legitimately thought that this was justified because Morales rigged it. As Arce just showed us, this is not the case. Bolivians won their country back due to their strong unions and constant striking, forcing the right to have fair elections in the end. Stupid neoliberals only made it harder for Bolivians by enabling fascists, once again.

HAHAHAHAHAHAHA That whole accusation has been widely debunked and defamation notices from some of the protestors have been sent out.

    <TEXT>''' A lot of it has to do with the same reason people call Sweden the Rape Capital of the World - we count and classify things different here. I do approve of our strict rape and sexual harassment classifications, but how we count deaths by COVID-19 is straight up stupid. So, pretty much no matter what the underlying conditions of persons death are, if they post-mortem classified as having traces of COVID-19, they count as a COVID-19 death. There was a case where a 90+ year old had terminal cancer, passed away, but it was still calculated as a COVID-death since they had the infection in their body. A friend of mines grandmother passed way about a month ago, also in her 90s. She had Alzheimer's, had fallen and injured herself somewhat badly and passed a few days after her fall. But, post-mortem she was shown to have had COVID-19, and the family was informed that she was classified as a COVID-death, and not had passed due to her underlying conditions and recent fall injuries... So next year I guess we'll know for sure, when we can measure previous years to this year and see what differs from our "normal" death rate.

    <TEXT>''' It's funny how you automatically assume I'm talking about Trump specifically. In fact I never called Trump a Nazi and I don't think he is one either. But you raise some good points. He is on the record for calling Neo Nazis "fine people", he fails to speak against white supremacy organizations every time he's been asked during a debate and he told a right-wing extremist paramilitary group to "stand back and stand by". Let's also not forget the concentration camps at the Mexican border where women are sterilized against their will, basically committing crimes against humanity. But even after all this, I don't think Trump is a Nazi. He's just an enabler who knows how to pander to those groups to further his own gain, which in turn gives legitimacy to all the Neo Nazis rallying behind Trump and the GOP. Trump, in the end, is the symptom, not the sickness. But the sickness has been slowly but steadily been coming out of the woodworks and they're welcomed with open arms.

    <TEXT>''' You will be downvoted for attempting to reason with Reddit on this one. For various reasons, they love Morales, and will automatically assume anyone who doesn't follow their narrative is some sort of CIA shill. The people around here are completely convinced that Morales won the election last time without voter fraud, are unaware of the massive pro-democracy protests that forced him out of power, and will explain away any suggestion that he was illegitimate by insisting that it was a CIA coup. They don't want to hear that he was being opposed by trade unions, environmentalists, and human rights activists. I am not sure that Morales drove his country into the ground though. GDP growth was pretty good, although given that the GDP was so low, higher rates of growth are easier to attain. Bolivia was impoverished when Morales took over. He left it somewhat less impoverished. For the poor Bolivians, however, it was a major step up and many of his policies were successful. From everything I have heard and read, Morales was given the boot because he was growing autocratic, not because of macroeconomics.

The scary part is that he #8217;s leveraged the 2nd amendment right in many urban areas as it relates to masking and shutting down our economy, as if Trump logically and tactically handled the coronavirus task force as such a way but instead really is doubling down on lies to cover his complete incompetence.

    <TEXT>''' The French Revolution generally is considered the starting point of nationalism in Europe, yes. I don #180;t know Hazony #180;s argument in detail, but the issue is that the jewish nationalist movement is a european movement, so Zionism really can #180;t claim to have been untouched by the pervasive influence of the european cultural milleu that shaped it.  gt;Hazony argues that the nationalism of the Hebrew Bible and ancient Israelites should be contrasted with the imperialism of ancient Greece and Rome. Is this the Schr #246;dinger #180;s OT argument where the biblical genocide happened, but not really and it was documented, but the fact that somebody figured it was worth documenting and preserving means that it #180;s not really important to the kingdom of Israel #180;s claims? The Kingdom of Israel was pressed by Empires all around it pretty much the same way the Israelitic communities in Europe were being washed by european cultural trends and politics 24/7. Claiming that they, as a pretty weak dependant state stood out as something unique and radically different in the region is somewhat strange. Even the Greek, who only had one flank towards one Empire, could not help but shape themselves in reaction to it, so on what basis would Israel who was constantly pressed by at least two, maintain such liberty?  gt;Also, does it make more sense to contrast nationalism with imperialism, or more sense to contrast nationalism with dynastic politics? How do either of those make sense? Monarchies survived the ascend of nationalism and there is no nation that deliberately picked nationalism over imperialism either. It was ethnonationalism that created strains Imperialism eventually could no longer bear, not "simple" nationalism. You could contrast the post-napoleonic situation with classic dynastic politics as at that point, placing your family members at the top of various nations basically had stopped being a meaningful tool of international politics.

    <DATE>2020-10-19 11:55:55</DATE>
    <TEXT>''' Muslims are projected to be a majority in France within a few generations. This means you really need to be more clear what you mean by France "assimilating" this (future projected) majority muslim population. At that point France will have a minority of native french people within its democracy who actually hold traditionally European values. In that sense this assimilation you speak of is basically already doomed to fail, unless you can somehow convince all these muslims to suddenly become liberal, in which case you will have a majority of liberal muslims. Seems unlikely... This is one of the reasons some people want to stop immigration, because they see the situation as being doomed in the sense that France will no longer have a "French" majority, but will essentially have a foreign population who hold foreign religious and political beliefs. So as much as you like to roll your eyes there is a very real discussion to be had here, and you really can't just write these concerns off as "racist conspiracy theory". Sources: If you use the commonly cited Pew Research articles, you won't get an accurate estimate because that is *exclusively* looking at *migration*, not birth rates between different populations already within France. Comparing the actual birth rates between different populations within the country is more accurate: [link]^^1  gt; Other studies have put the French official birthrate at 1.4 children per woman and the Muslim birthrate between 3.4 and 4 children per woman, with French economist Charles Gave predicting a Muslim majority in France in 40 years, but organizations such Pew Research say that the birthrate for Muslim women is lower, coming in at 2.8 children per woman.

    <TEXT>''' Hallo. I have been hearing many wonderful things about Germany's Christmas market. This year I am looking forward to attending my first Christmas market in Dusseldorf. Hopefully it doesn't get cancelled due to Cobid-15. Although, I have one fear. I know that Europe sometimes has problems with a certain group of people, especially around "religious" related events like what happened in Berlin in the past. I'd love to take my family to the Christmas market but I fear for our safety. If those group of people decided to cause problems cause (how much worse can 20202 get?), how likely would they do so in Dusseldorf? Or do they just stick to capital cities like Berlin and Paris?

Isn't it the collective consciousness which is working in this regard for dividing each other where right leaning media/institutions/political parties etc are focusing on their victimhood and left leaning are busy making new victims/ normalizing what is not normal just because the ignorance of Indian culture and hatred/ego due to this ignorance. And both side are calling BJP responsible (FYI.. I am not BJP supporter and I am looking for something more nationalist). All the people here are also doing the same as if wound in leg is leg wound, not body wound. People are separating oneself from whole and blaming others and calling "idiots" "lesser minds" etc. All the notion that " we are all equal irrespective of caste and religion " is pointing toward right side of above image view. We are not all equal, nature doesn't have equality in it, it has equity and uniqueness which comes from differences. The whole concept of equality and desperate attempt to reach is futile and is causing the problem in society as search of happiness causes more unhappiness. The concept of equality is always in future and unrealistic which we don't want to accept because there are religious doctrines/theology from which it is derived, imposed and imbibed in us. We should strive for equity not something called equality (which is similar to right side of image).  #8203; " There is a large silent majority in the country, who are secular, sane and believe in the foundations that this great country was built on. " The sense of superiority and ego boost with calling oneself secular, "sane" and one's belief while demeaning others, is cause of this division/fragmentation, either in form of religion, caste and now in form of secular and non secular etc. " Don't lie back and let them win. " Whole ideology that there is some war going on is imported from western ideology and is now celebrated here as if something worth celebrating. There is no war going on, and if it is, it is just in your mind. The movement of power from long lasting incumbent or establishment causes this division in anything in nature be it a cell, or idea etc and now we are talking about society and a "nation" ( I think people here see India as territorial state, not as civilization state). I agree that BJP is not doing enough of nationalist or civilization stuff and thus more nationalist government is required. Otherwise with shift of power from west to east(china), India with current state of division of left and right, Indic and non indic, religious ( not caste) etc will soon become a ghetto of crime and illegal operations etc for China, very similar to how south/latin America is for USA.
