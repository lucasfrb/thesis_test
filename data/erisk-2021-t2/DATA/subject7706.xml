    <TEXT>No, I'm not stupid. The base game already had all the maps so why should we keep re downloading the exact same textures after every single update?</TEXT>

    <TEXT>well, you could have simply said that instead of calling me stupid. You don't always have to be a dick just because you're anonymous. And to answer your question no, I do not play a lot of online multiplayer games. My busy lifestyle can't allow it.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I'm just sharing the memes, I don't make them. You must really enjoy harassing random people on the internet, don't you? Posting a meme on reddit takes 2 minutes, playing an online multiplayer game can take hours. You see where am going with this?</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Ok, but don't take it out on me. I was simply curious, not complaining. There's a difference. Speaking of toxicity, people who call other people stupid for petty reasons also make the community toxic.</TEXT>
