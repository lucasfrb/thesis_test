    <TITLE>Keto Breath</TITLE>
    <DATE>2018-06-05 02:39:02</DATE>
    <TEXT>I kissed my partner abt two hours after brushing my teeth in the morning and he said  #8220;your breath STINKS #8221;! At first I was wondering how that could be possible, but maybe this is the ketosis breath I keep hearing about? I brushed my teeth again but I #8217;m embarrassed to say hearing that from him made me excited because it must mean this is working! I #8217;ve never used ketostix so it #8217;s all off approximating my weight loss and counting macros. When this happened I was ~30 hours into a 48 hour fast that I started after already being in ketosis from  gt;20g carbs a day and IF for the last 2 and a half months.</TEXT>

    <TITLE>[TW food / BDD vent] some days are worse than others</TITLE>
    <DATE>2019-01-10 01:25:43</DATE>
    <TEXT>(preface - I've been trying to take baby steps towards a recovery mindset but I'm not quite there yet. I apologize if this is not the right space for this.) the morning after a late night binge is always the fucking WORST. I'm in the middle of a move, busy as hell and I've been nailing my step goal and \[mostly\] successfully restricting via OMAD and steadily losing. I started feeling the restriction high yesterday after fasting all day and had a pretty safe dinner out with a friend, that should have been enough but NOPE. Sonic accidentally giving me a medium ice cream blast instead of a mini blast that I ordered to \~treat myself\~ and look normal in front of my boyfriend triggered a nasty binge - for hours I nibbled on expired Kim-chi, lettuce dipped in hummus, 10 marshmallow peeps, 1/3 of a dark chocolate easter bunny (I know, it's JANUARY) - just cleaning out old hoarded food that somehow migrated to my new house. I didn't purge because I was scared of waking him up (I cough every time). woke up in HELL after taking a bunch of lax before/during binge, my partner must have heard my stomach sounding like an alien signal transmission because he whispered "hope you feel better" as he ran out the door. Instead of the productive morning I had planned I've stayed in bed stretching/squeezing myself, BM, scale, body-check, repeat. I feel like I'm trapped in a loop and I can't bring myself to leave my apartment until the number on the scale is more 'acceptable' and every atom of bullshit I ate last night is out of my body so my brain can reset. I also mindfucked myself by looking back at facebook photos of me when I was in high school and felt thin, now looking back on them I'm thinking "What the hell, was I always so chubby and I just never knew?" Cue taking more body checks, comparing. That's been the 3 hours since I woke up, by the way usually it takes me 10 minutes to get ready. My boyfriend just called me and said he'll be back to his place for his lunch break soon giving me 5 minutes heads-up, he thought I had already started my planned productive day. Now I'm upset at myself for being trapped in my head like this and digging into my time with him, I'll be lucky if I catch him before his break ends because I live 10 minutes away and I still feel disgusting, bloated, stuck. today has been one of the shittier days yet but it's not even noon, I'm going to make an effort to turn it around. I guess what I'm trying to say is that it's possible to try and break out of the loops we trap ourselves in, both cognitive loops and also compulsive behavior loops. I'm done with saying "I'll never binge again", instead I'm going to try and forgive myself and do whatever it takes to move the hell on and try and hate myself a little less for it, whatever it takes because I'm tired of mornings like this. **UPDATE:** worked up courage to post this in the evening after a full day. I did get myself out the door in time to hang out with my bf, ran all my errands, spontaneously hung out with a friend, made a snack, staying hydrated, planning to bathe tonight. resisting self destructive urges. :') trying to work up the drive to cook something for myself before midnight tonight. things can and will get better I hope.</TEXT>

    <TITLE>Tips for restricting when you have guilt over food waste?</TITLE>
    <DATE>2019-02-18 20:21:36</DATE>
    <TEXT>I #8217;m torn between wanting to eat food in my fridge just so it doesn #8217;t go bad, but simultaneously not wanting to break a comfortable fast. I feel shitty eating for the sake of eating/to get rid of food in my fridge, like a human garbage disposal. Especially if I know I would feel fine not eating it, but I feel guilty wasting it. Earlier this week I broke a fast to eat a 100cal Greek yogurt because I noticed it was 3 days expired and I didn #8217;t want it to become inedible/waste it. I #8217;ve cooked food after cutting around mold/ruined parts of fresh vegetables so it doesn #8217;t go to waste. :( a head of cabbage usually takes me a week and a half to eat. I don #8217;t eat out very much and I #8217;m one of those freaks that actually loves leftovers! I would almost rather eat expired food and get sick rather than throw it out. I #8217;m financially secure now, but I used to be very poor and I think that when this mentality started. Anyone else feel like this, and is it a subset of food hoarding? Do y #8217;all just stick to frozen foods and packaged food, should I just give up on fresh food? Or force myself to be okay with throwing out food?  #129335; #8205; #9792; #65039;</TEXT>

    <TEXT>best pancakes ever no joke. they are so big and filling for only 121 cal. you can substitute 2 tbsp egg whites if you don #8217;t have powdered egg white and use less water. the zucchini and banana negate all dryness from the oat fiber, so moist! Later this week I wanna try this recipe with mashed kabocha squash instead of zucchini and drizzle some powdered almond butter mixed with skinny syrup on top.  #128548; - (9) 87g grated/shredded zucchini (I used my mandoline vegetable slicer) - 1/2 tsp baking powder - 20g oat fiber - (53) 15g arrowhead mills protein pancake  amp; waffle mix - (34) 1 tbsp egg white powder ( #8220;egg white protein - nothing else! #8221; on amazon) - (25) 28g mashed ripe banana - 1/2 cup of water - vanilla extract, apple pie spice, English toffee liquid stevia drops - any toppings your heart desires mix together baking powder, oat fiber, pancake mix and egg white powder until evenly combined. slowly add water (I did 2 tbsp at a time) until a thick but pour-able batter forms). Add liquid sweeteners, vanilla, apple pie spice, mashed banana and zucchini. Yields 3 big pancakes. Heat non stick skillet over medium heat and use a little nonstick spray. they do hold together/flip really well but you gotta wait until they cook all the way through before you flip! Mine were 2-3 minutes per side. top with any toppings you want - I did 4g white chocolate chips (21), sugar free maple syrup, and whipped cream (15). - (30) 62g kale - (40) 2 tbsp egg beaters - (26) 26g butter beans - Tabasco sauce, sriracha popcorn seasoning, butter flavor reasoning, cumin season kale and steam 2 minutes in microwave. Add butter beans and microwave additional 30 sec. scramble egg beaters after you make your pancakes and top your vegetables with them, and add hot sauce to taste if desired</TEXT>

As part of my weekly meal prep, I steamed kabocha squash chunks in the microwave for 5 minutes and mashed them as smooth as I could with a fork and stored them in the fridge - so they were already mashed up ready to go! For the pancakes, in a small microwave safe bowl I heated the 84g mashed kabocha with 1/3 cup water, vanilla extract, cinnamon and stevia drops. I mashed the warm squash with the water until it was a smooth thick liquid - makes it easier to evenly incorporate into the pancake batter. Pour squash/water into pancake batter and slowly add another 1/3 cup water, whisking together until a thick batter forms. Cook 4-5 minutes per side at medium heat. They came out so nice and fluffy and browned perfectly - can #8217;t wait to make them again!!! I also highly recommend someone try these with mashed sweet potato too because that would be DANK</TEXT>

Bake for 10-12 minutes. while baking your crust, combine filling ingredients: - (14) 41g frozen mixed vegetables California blend (broccoli, cauliflower, carrots - I defrosted them in the microwave then squeezed out some of the extra water then chopped them into small pieces) - salt, pepper, optional few drops of liquid smoke seasoning (it #8217;s great on veggies). - (15) 1/2 wedge laughing cow seasoning. defrost veggies, chop them, put them back in a microwave safe dish with chunks of laughing cow and then heat another 30 seconds/stir so cheese covers veggies. when your crust is ready, take it out of the oven and pile all the veggies in the center of the crust and spread them out a little. Cover evenly with remaining batter and bake an additional 12-15 minutes. Top with optional balsamic vinegar (5) or green onions (3).</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Instant strawberry whipped cream found at halal market - 10g is only 20 calories and yields about 2/3 cup whipped cream or more if you use a better milk frother, blender or hand mixer. I really wanna try making nice cream out of this haha. You just add a tiny bit of water to the powder and it froths into cream https://ibb.co/hyN39m9 Cookie: sub pb chips for regular chips. I also have uploaded a recipe for a variant that uses mashed banana instead of applesauce but I used applesauce this time :) https://www.reddit.com/r/safe_food/comments/epksyn/120_breakfast_53_calorie_soft_chewy_vegan_gluten/?utm_source=share amp;utm_medium=ios_app amp;utm_name=iossmf Blackberry cheesecake topping: - (19) 30g frozen blackberry thawed with extra liquid drained out - (22) 8g whipped light mixed berry cream cheese - (0) tbsp confectioners swerve - 1/2 tbsp warm water - tiniest tiny dusting of xanthan gum (like the amount you would use to season salt - a little goes a long way) mash blackberry with cream cheese, then mash in swerve sweetener and warm water, add xanthan gum and stir vigorously and leave in fridge to set. I decided to be extra and spoon the berry cheesecake topping into a little ziplock bag with a hole cut in the corner so I could pipe it on and make it look cute. :) scramble: - (17) 2 tbsp egg white - (20) 128g canned chopped mustard greens - (3) 8g green onion cook mustard greens in a little turmeric, butter flavoring, salt, pepper and paprika. make a well in the center and pour in your eggs (I seasoned with black pepper) and let them cook mostly through before you scramble them.

I added the tiniest sprinkle of cornstarch slurry (less than a gram) to help it set but that #8217;s totally optional, didn #8217;t weigh it bc it #8217;s a negligible amount and you gotta fight the power sometimes! season to taste - I did paprika, butter extract flavoring, and cumin. nudge crab and onion to one side of the pan and pour batter over it so half your omelette holds the fillings. Allow to cook all the way through (will be golden orange) 3-5 minutes, then flip the half of the omelette with no fillings onto the filled half and flip the whole thing so it cooks all the way through. Top with everything bagel seasoning :)</TEXT>

    <TEXT>turnips are so good! When you braise them (basically boil the crap out of them) they get so tender and melt in your mouth kinda similar taste as a bite of mashed potato - (38) 141g raw turnip peeled and cut into cubes - seasonings: I used butter flavor extract, McCormick tasty  #8220;cheesy #8221; and veggie roasters Parmesan Mediterranean seasoning. - (20) 120g French style canned green beans - (4) 20g sliced white mushrooms - (10) 8g reduced fat sour cream - (4) 11g green onion add turnip cubes to a pot with enough water to cover them and your seasonings. Cover pot, turn heat to high and boil the ever-loving shit outta them. Check after 10/15 minutes and remove lid, then continue to boil until there #8217;s only about 2 tbsp of liquid left. Add green beans and turn heat down to medium and simmer. In a separate skillet saut #233; mushrooms and season to taste. Add sour cream to the bowl you plan to serve your dish in and pour in veggies, stir until the veggies are creamy. Top with saut #233;ed mushroom and green onion. This was such a satisfying dish  #129316; Dessert: I mixed 1 tbsp regular whipped cream w/ 30g low-fat cottage cheese (21) and banana split skinny syrup and added a SF jello cup (5) and one more tbsp Reese #8217;s whipped cream (same cals as regular whipped cream - 15 for 2 tbsp) and 12g diced raspberry (6)</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I pick one protein, something crunchy, a kind of fruit and fill around that with veggies! I plan out all my lunches the Sunday before the week and weigh/prep/log them the night before so I don #8217;t have to worry about it in the morning. I try and keep my lunch (biggest meal of the day) around 200-350 calories. I like warm foods, my fav thing is so combine all the veggies with some kind of sauce in a Tupperware and steam them in the microwave! Also fruit slices with stevia - apple, grapefruit, peaches or plums, berries sometimes.. also when you #8217;re feeling uninspired sometimes it helps me to move all the foods that expire/perish first to the counter and see what goes together/what meal combinations are possible from those ingredients.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>scone: - 1/2 tsp baking powder - 1/2 tbsp sugar free maple syrup - (2) 1/2 tbsp almond milk - few drops vanilla extract - (50) 15g all purpose flour - 15g oat fiber - (25) 1 tbsp (6g) powdered almond butter, half goes in scone, other half goes in icing - confectioner #8217;s swerve sweetener - (8) 15g frozen blueberries - (optional) monkfruit granular sugar to top your scone Preheat oven to 350 F Mix together 3g powdered almond butter, 1.5 tbsp water, almond milk, sugar free maple syrup, vanilla extract in small bowl until smooth. In a different bowl whisk together baking powder, flour and oat fiber. Add dry ingredients to wet and knead with spatula until a dough forms. If your dough is too dry, add just enough water for it to hold together in a ball without sticking to the sides of the bowl. Add blueberries and mash your dough into a ball, lightly press the top of it until it #8217;s the shape you want (will be more moist if you don #8217;t press it super thin). Place your scone in a lightly sprayed baking sheet and bake for 15-18 minutes. add 2 tbsp confectioners swerve to a small microwaveable dish with 1 tbsp water and microwave 25 seconds. Add 3g powdered almond butter and stir until a smooth thick icing forms. frost scone when it #8217;s slightly cooled, I sprinkled a little apple pie spice on top! scone was perfect, I was worried it might be too dry but it was soft inside and lightly crispy on the outside - just right! My scramble: - (16) 30g kale greens - (16) 17g imitation crab - (25) 3 tbsp egg white - (5) 1/2 envelope rice seasoning (sprinkle to taste)</TEXT>

    <TEXT>as soon as I took the first bite I was so hype to share this recipe!! ready in about 5 minutes for when you want a sweet breakfast in a flash. I think it has a nice sweetness but I added sugar free maple syrup, cinnamon and apple pie spice on top just because. - 1 tsp baking powder - 22g oat fiber - (75) 21g instant oatmeal (from a 100 cal packet) - 2 spoonfuls lakanto monkfruit granular 0 cal sweetener (can sub stevia) - (25) 3 tbsp egg white - (27) 30g yoplait whips vanilla cupcake Greek yogurt - (36) 40g mashed ripe banana - (2) 2 tbsp unsweet almond milk - 2 tbsp water - optional: few drops cake batter flavoring, 7-8 drops English toffee liquid stevia sweetener) mix dry ingredients thoroughly (oat fiber, monkfruit sweetener, oatmeal, baking powder). In another bowl, mash banana then add yogurt, egg white, cashew milk, water and any liquid sweeteners. Whisk until smooth and add to dry ingredients - will resemble pancake batter. spray a microwave safe bowl with nonstick spray and transfer in batter, microwave on high 2 minutes and 30 seconds. Sounds like a long time but this is a BIG BOI and it takes awhile for the cake to set evenly through the center! It will rise a LOT - I #8217;ve made an baked version of this and I actually PREFER the microwave version because it #8217;s bigger, lighter and fluffier!</TEXT>

    <TEXT>5 ingredient overnight baked French toast for less than 200 calories: - (68) 1.5 slices of zero carb bread cubes - (42) 5 tbsp egg white - (30) 70g frozen unsweetened mixed fruit - (40) 1/8 cup bear naked cinnamon roll granola - (18) 1/2 tbsp coffee creamer (I used vanilla caramel) optional flavorings/add ins I used - you can get creative: - cinnamon - butter flavor liquid extract - 2 oz birthday cake skinny syrup - sprinkle of lakanto monkfruit sweetener on top - vanilla extract the night before, whisk together egg white with coffee creamer, skinny syrup and any desired liquid flavorings and cinnamon in a bowl. Cut frozen fruit into small pieces (my blend has cherries and peach slices). add cinnamon, cubed zero carb bread and sliced fruit to the bowl and stir until the bread has soaked up almost all the egg mixture. Transfer to an oven safe bowl and top with granola, lakanto monkfruit sweetener sprinkled on top and additional cinnamon. cover with Saran Wrap until the next morning. The next morning, preheat oven to 350 and bake your French toast bowl uncovered for 20 minutes (top of bread and granola will he toasted). I drizzled a little Walden farms pancake syrup on top and it was amazing!!! Can #8217;t wait to make again, I think a chocolate banana PB2 version would be so good  #128525; Creamy omelette rice cake: - (40) 2 tbsp whole egg egg-beaters - (9) 7g reduced fat sour cream - (35) one Quaker lightly salted rice cake - tiny dab minced garlic (for omelette) and Dijon (for rice cake) - (14) 5g whipped cream cheese spread whisk together egg beaters with sour cream and garlic, season to taste (I used black pepper and paprika). Spread whipped cream cheese and Dijon thinly on rice cake. In a small non stick pan, cook egg mixture evenly on both sides (mini omelette!). top rice cake with omelette - I sprinkled a little 0 cal McCormick tasty  #8220;cheesy #8221; seasoning on top.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>usually I draw inspiration from recipes when I cook but I am v proud to say the idea for this creamy crab Alfredo vegetable casserole is 100% my own! I used riced kohlrabi because it was open in my freezer but it would be so good with cauliflower rice as well. I hope you enjoy this as much as I did! If you don #8217;t want to bake it, I am confident this would also work microwaved (probably 2 minutes). - (24) 25g chopped imitation crab (I think it would be amazing w/ cocktail shrimp or tofu too!) - (38) 10g garlic herb seasoned bread instant stuffing mix - (25) 3 tbsp egg white - (18) 30g Ragu simply garlic Parmesan cauliflower pasta sauce - (4) 20g diced green bell pepper - (25) 85g riced kohlrabi - (9) 2g earths best crunching crackers crushed to sprinkle on top (3 small crackers) - black pepper, butter flavor extract, garlic salt, McCormick tasty  #8220;cheesy #8221; seasoning preheat oven to 350 F whisk together egg white w/ seasonings and egg white in an oven safe baking dish. Rehydrate 10g of bread crumb stuffing in a little hot water until fluffy and moist (separate bowl). Reheat frozen veggie rice until it #8217;s not clumpy (it #8217;s on if it #8217;s still cold). Add crab, bell pepper, veggie rice, and garlic herb stuffing to bowl with egg white/sauce and toss until everything is evenly mixed and coated with sauce. top with additional seasoning (optional) and crushed crackers. Bake 20 minutes and let cool 5 minutes before you enjoy :) the combo of the crab with the Alfredo was amazing, almost reminded me of a frittata! Definite comfort food.  #128519;</TEXT>

Boil on high heat. While they boil, thaw frozen vegetables in microwave and cut into bite size pieces. When water in pan is reduced by half, add tomato paste (stir until it becomes a broth), seasonings and stevia drops along with California veggie mix, chickpeas, and cabbage. Simmer until there is just a little broth remaining (you want some left to steam your kale!). Add kale, diced tomato and enoki mushroom along with any additional seasonings. Continue to simmer until your broth is evaporated and kale/enoki mushroom is tender. Serve topped with cranberry orange sauce! this was the perfect blend of sweet and savory, the angel hair coleslaw (very thin sliced cabbage) and enoki mushroom mimic noodles so the dish feels a lot more pasta-like than if it were shirataki only  #9786; #65039;</TEXT>

    <TEXT>good way to jazz up a packet of instant oatmeal - this has been on my list of recipes to try for awhile and it turned out real yummy! - (100) 1 packet original instant oatmeal - 2/3 cup water - 1 oz skinny syrup (I used blueberry lavender) - (17) 2 tbsp egg white - 1/2 tsp baking powder - (13) 25g frozen blueberries - (31) 35g banana - 10g oat fiber - pumpkin pie spice (or cinnamon, apple pie spice, optional) Preheat oven to 350 F whisk together oat fiber, instant oatmeal and baking powder. Mash 2/3 of your banana and slice the rest thinly to put on top. To your dry ingredients, add water, egg white,skinny syrup, spices and mashed banana. Stir in blueberries. Lightly spray an oven safe bowl w/ nonstick spray and transfer in your oatmeal. Top with sliced banana. Bake 20 minutes! the border around the bowl has a fluffy cake like texture and the center is warm creamy oatmeal - I love how it turned out and it was sweet enough to enjoy without any additions (but of course whipped cream, sugar free syrup etc would have been amazing - maybe next time!) 10/10 will make again (maybe with raspberries, peaches and a little granola?)</TEXT>

I sprinkled a little erythritol on the top. Let sit overnight Next morning preheat oven to 350. Bake 15-20 minutes. 195 cal without additional toppings, but it felt right to mix up 1 tbsp chocolate PB2 (23) w/ bday cake skinny syrup. W/ additional PB2 this packs 27g of protein. Perfect weekend brunch before hitting the gym.</TEXT>

This only requires one bowl and it #8217;s oh so simple! Combine baking soda/powder, oat fiber, all purpose flour and granular sweetener in a bowl and stir until fully combined. To dry ingredients, add applesauce, almond milk, egg white, vanilla extract, and stevia drops. Stir gently until combined. Sprinkle 5g of chocolate chips on top. Microwave 2 minutes, or until center of mug cake is set. It #8217;s so fluffy and has an amazing flavor!! 55 calorie zucchini noodle breakfast nest - (7) 38g zucchini noodles - (16) 80g canned diced tomato - (17) 2 tbsp egg white - (15) 2 tbsp salsa - salt and pepper microwave zucchini noodles and tomato 2 minutes. Drizzle on egg white, season with pepper and microwave 1 minute 30 seconds. Season with salt and add salsa. Seriously delicious.</TEXT>

Kimchi, bean sprouts, rice seasoning (furikake), grass jelly is kind of an acquired taste but I love how it tastes with sliced cantaloupe melon and Splenda :D and it #8217;s super low cal</TEXT>

Cover and let rest in the fridge. Add 2 cups of water to a pot with a lid and add baby carrots and a little garlic salt. Bring to a boil, then cover and reduce heat to medium high, simmer for 20 minutes. Add beet and cabbage to pot with carrots and simmer covered for an additional 15/20 minutes. While soup simmers, we want to caramelize our onions! Lightly spray a nonstick pan with cooking spray and add onions. Saut #233; over medium heat until onions are soft and translucent, optional - add minced garlic (5). Add tomato paste to saut #233;ed onions and continue to saut #233; until tomato paste has softened and coated onions. Add saut #233;ed onion/tomato paste mixture to pot with vegetable soup for remaining simmering time. Reuse your small nonstick skillet for maple tofu - rinse it out and spray a light mist of nonstick spray. Add tofu cubes with sauce and saut #233; over medium high heat until tofu is crispy on all sides. Serve your soup topped with crispy tofu  #9829; #65039; * the recipe I based this off of (from the blog Full of Plants) suggests soaking cashews overnight and blending them into a cream to top the soup with. Calories for that scare me but it sounds really good!</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I love pancakes, and this recipe has a v big yield! The trick is to wait for them to cook all the way through before you flip them, they are very fluffy and crepe-like. - (42) 12g arrowhead mills protein pancake mix - 20g oat fiber - 1/2 tsp baking powder - 2 tbsp erythritol or stevia - (30) 42g fat free cottage cheese - (17) 2 tbsp egg whites - 1/4 cup water - English toffee stevia drops and apple pie spice - (22) 45g raspberries (set aside a couple to put on top) - optional: 4g peanut butter chips (21), sugar free maple syrup, light whipped cream (15) mix together pancake mix, oat fiber, baking powder and dry sweetener until evenly combined. Add egg white, cottage cheese and water with apple pie spice and stevia drops, whisk until smooth. Stir in raspberry pieces. Cook pancakes in a nonstick pan 2-4 minutes per side - bubbles will appear throughout pancake when it #8217;s ready and the edges will look somewhat dry when it #8217;s time to flip them You can smush your cottage cheese up with the raspberries before you add it too, I forgot to do that but it might result in a smoother batter. :)</TEXT>

    <TEXT>sadly I was kinda unintentionally quarantining myself pre-pandemic. I went to the gym every morning and I went to class, but I started getting ready for bed around 6:30pm last summer and my early bedtime makes it pretty impossible to have a social life. I try to go to sleep early because when restriction insomnia strikes sometimes I can #8217;t get enough sleep even with sleeping meds, and my resting HR is generally lower when I can get 8-11 hours of sleep a night. I was a little more extroverted before I relapsed into my ED, but my social anxiety has been getting progressively worse over the last few years and sometimes social stress makes me eat more than I #8217;m comfortable with. basically fear of how anxiety affects my hunger makes me avoid any social situation where food may be involved. I #8217;m so used to going to bed early now that the couple times over the last month I tried to hang out with friends I started getting sleepy around 8/9pm. I hang out with my significant other frequently but I only have 2 close friends outside of my s/o #8217;s friend circle and I haven #8217;t seen either of them in about a month.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Hunger makes it hard to sleep longer than 2-3 hours at a time. I would take ambien, melatonin AND over the counter sleep aids and still not be able to sleep through the night. Usually after waking up once or twice in the middle of the night, I wake up around 4:30/5:00 am and not be able to fall back asleep so I would just go to the gym. :( now I #8217;m eating 400-600 calories at bedtime and I added ativan to my  #8220;sleep stack #8221; (the opposite of an EC stack #8221;) and I can sleep 7-8 hours but I #8217;m not losing weight as fast as when I was having 150 - 200 calorie dinners.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>- 3 cups water (will reduce when you simmer broth) - 2 small stalks lemongrass (find in produce section with other small prepared/packaged herbs) - (20) small can pieces  amp; stems mushrooms - (26) 90g riced kohlrabi (or cauliflower) - (7) 58g raw celery (with leaves) thinly cut - (12) 30g baby carrots cut into coins - (10) 58g cubed daikon radish - (21) 42g chopped raw kale - (37) 39g medium frozen shrimp cut lemongrass on the diagonal into 4 pieces and crush the pieces using the blunt side of a large knife (helps release flavor). Simmer water with lemongrass for 30-40 minutes in a covered pot - the longer you simmer the more flavorful your broth will be. Remove lemongrass and add carrots, daikon radish and frozen riced kohlrabi. Boil uncovered 10 minutes. Then add the rest of the veggies and shrimp and simmer an additional 10-15 minutes. Season to taste with black pepper, garlic salt and onion powder  #128076; #9786; #65039;</TEXT>

    <TEXT>this slapped so hard omg! The butternut squash makes it creamy and all you have to do is throw all the ingredients in a rice cooker or instant pot. - (60) 1 lightlife veggie  #8220;smart dog #8221; - (63) 141g raw butternut squash - (17) 95g daikon radish - (25) 59g red onion - (12) 30g baby carrots - (38) 80g apple - (12) 53g cauliflower rice - (10) 85g miracle shirataki rice - (15) 1 envelope rice seasoning (I used sake chazuki flavor) - garlic salt, onion powder, 1 envelope pumpkin spice equal, 1 tsp stevia or erythritol Peel butternut squash, apple and daikon. Cut them into small bite size cubes. Cut baby carrots into small coins. Cut red onion into small slivers. Add squash, apple, daikon, carrot and onion into a rice cooker with frozen cauliflower with a little shake of garlic salt and onion powder, and stevia/pumpkin spice equal (optional but it tastes like autumn!). Add just enough water to cover everything and cook 20 minutes (mine has a cook setting and a  #8220;warm #8221; setting, I used default cook mode). After 20 minutes add miracle rice and cut smart dog into little pieces and add. Cook another 10-15 minutes. Serve topped with rice seasoning. Yields a really big bowl!</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Oat fiber!! I #8217;ve posted many recipes that use it - it #8217;s a fine flour-like powder that is 100% insoluble fiber so it #8217;s technically a 0 calorie food and it helps you stay regular. It dissolves super easily too so if you #8217;re not into baking you can add it into oatmeal or a smoothie and it #8217;ll blend right in.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I #8217;m also struggling with bulimia during the pandemic - it #8217;s gotten to the point where if I feel any food in my stomach it #8217;s a trigger to purge. im in therapy and on meds and it #8217;s beeb such a struggle.. I was taking Prozac to suppress b/p urges and I ended up purging almost every day on it. I #8217;ve realized that meds and therapy can help give you an edge over the disordered behavior urges but they don #8217;t solve all your problems. My only advice to you is to not give up on yourself and keep trying different strategies to not purge. I feel like I #8217;ve tried everything, some things that helped me were taking vitamins with a meal that I #8217;d feel guilty purging, making a meal extra spicy so I don #8217;t want to purge it, Kratom has helped me a lot too. Also delaying the urge enough is sometimes enough to prevent it. Every time you say  #8220;no #8221; to your bulimia it #8217;s a win. some days I say  #8220;no #8221; 4 times before I give in, but purging once is better than 5 times. Work on harm reduction and stress tolerance to try and get resilient enough to not let the urge to yeet break you down, and strong enough to stop yourself from letting a normal meal turn into a b/p. Just take it a couple hours at a time!</TEXT>

I personally think the texture and flavor is better when you rice it yourself.  #9786; #65039; I added celery, cauliflower and seasoned radish to a non stick skillet over med low heat for about 10-15 minutes. Green onion I added 2 minutes before serving. The red color comes from the sauce of the seasoned dried radish - a Korean grocery store by my house sells it and the owners make it fresh. I also added about 1 tsp of sambal oelek chili sauce (0) and a little sprinkle of rice seasoning (negligible calories)</TEXT>

    <TEXT>yes!! Oat fiber does NOT behave like flour. If you add too much oat fiber, the cake will either not rise or have a weird texture. I #8217;ve found the perfect ratio to bake with oat fiber is 2 parts oat fiber to 1-1.5 parts flour. Mug cakes are easier to cook so you can get away with a 1 to 2 flour to oat fiber ratio. With pancakes and waffles, you need to increase the amount of flour you use or it won #8217;t hold together (see my post history for an example of that  #129315;)</TEXT>

    <TEXT>It #8217;s really good!! I like that there are calories per tub so sometimes I eat half but sometimes I finish it and it #8217;s only 160-180 calories. Better than eating a whole pint and my binge brain gets the same satisfaction from getting to finish something. The textures and flavors are really nice and it doesn #8217;t really melt - it just softens into a sorta ice cream fluff so that #8217;s a big win if you also like to eat really slowly.

Then add the curry powder and green beans and cook 3-5 minutes until everything is hot. Add the cashew milk and Greek cream cheese spread and stir to make a broth/sauce. Add the spring mix when there is still some cashew milk liquid in the pan. simmer over medium low heat until the veggies absorb all the liquid. Microwave cauliflower rice 2 min 30 seconds if frozen and then add the curry to the bowl. Top with green onions (I added some of the green onions to the curry but that #8217;s optional.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Of course!! It was really yummy and only ~30 calories. bottom layer: blended 2/3 cup unsweetened cashew milk with 20g frozen blueberries and a few drops of vanilla liquid stevia foam: 1 sachet of ganoderma instant reishi coffee, 1.5 tablespoons of granular erythritol, 1 tbsp hot water and about 1/8 cup chickpea water (aquafaba - I #8217;m not sure how many calories are in such a small amount?) I first whipped it up a little without the aquafaba using a milk frother, then I added the aquafaba and continued to froth it until I got about a cup of thick foam. No weird chickpea taste either!! the erythritol makes it really sweet.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>- 1 sachet Trader Joe #8217;s spiced chai tea - (38) 10g steel cut oats - (15) 3g chia seeds - (40) 10g quick oats - (48) 53g banana - cinnamon - caramel stevia drops - cookie dough skinny syrup (or other flavor) soak oats, chia seeds and quick oats in boiling water with spiced chai tea bag placed on top - adds more tea flavor. I think I used about a cup of water. I use my electric tea kettle and soaked it for about an hour. Remove tea bag and microwave 4 minutes, monitoring it to make sure it doesn #8217;t overflow (I had to pause halfway through to let it settle down). Meanwhile heat a little skinny syrup in a non stick pan (about 2 tbsp) and add sliced banana, sprinkle with cinnamon, saut #233; on both sides until the skinny syrup is soaked in and banana looks caramelized. It won #8217;t really char because it #8217;s not real sugar. Stir in caramel stevia to the chai oatmeal and top with bananas and additional cinnamon if desired.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>https://www.reddit.com/r/Volumeeating/comments/g815h1/3050kcal_magic_brownies_depending_on_how_big_you/?utm_source=share amp;utm_medium=ios_app amp;utm_name=iossmf The original recipe is baked in the oven and has a bigger yield. So far I #8217;ve made this TWICE and it #8217;s so decadent and chocolatey. For my version, you microwave 4 min at 50% power or 1 minute at full power - cooking it slow and low creates that shiny and slightly brownie top exactly like the full calorie version. I #8217;ve made this using 100% oat fiber as the flour (84 calories) and it works because of the yogurt! No texture issues. My erythritol is a lot sweeter than my stevia, so for the first batch I did 15g of erythritol and it was perfect. The second batch I did 50g powdered stevia and it turned out just as good - you can flex around the sweetener as you see fit. - 18g oat fiber, OR 12g oat fiber and 6g oat bran hot cereal or quick oats - 1g baking powder - 15g to 50g sweetener, depends on which one you #8217;re using and how sweet it is - (33) 15g unsweetened cocoa powder - (18) 5g protein powder (I used Quest vanilla milkshake) - (3) 1/8 cup unsweetened cashew milk - (5) 10g egg whites - (25) 62g carbmaster vanilla yogurt, can also do 0% greek. Whisk together all dry ingredients then add wet ingredients and use a spoon or spatula to form a thick batter. Make sure it #8217;s in a microwave safe bowl. Microwave 4 minutes uncovered at 50% power, or 1 to 1.5 minutes. It #8217;ll be fudgy, melt in your mouth, but also crumble like cake!! /u/boo9817 is the OG for this</TEXT>

Press gently to seal it all together and put the roll on a plate  #8220;seam #8221; side down. Refrigerate 30 min to an hour. Cut into rolls with a sharp knife. Top with green onions, everything bagel seasoning, a few drops of liquid aminos (or soy sauce/shoyu) has green onions. serve with any remaining cucumber that didn #8217;t fit in your roll.  #129392; Have y #8217;all seen those 35 cal egg white crepes??? I think Publix has them in the refrigerated section. I #8217;ve been dying to try a lower cal version of this with vegan tuna and more avocado - once I get my hands on those it #8217;s going down</TEXT>

    <TEXT>My crepe recipe - yields 8-10 crepes. I make these for my partner all the time.. I stole one from the last batch I made for him. Combine in blender - - 1 egg - about 1/3 cup flour - about 1/2 cup to 2/3 cup almond milk you know the ratio is right when the batter is like a thin smoothie or milkshake. I don #8217;t calculate calories for his food so the crepe was kind of a challenge food for me! I just went by weight calc in FitBit app for average crepe They cook 1 to 3 minutes per side over medium heat in nonstick pan - when top of crepe appears lightly dry and uniformly tan its ready to flip (And yes - an egg white oat fiber crepe recipe is in the works  #128523; using a regular crepe felt like such a luxury!</TEXT>

You can #8217;t taste the oat fiber at all, sooo moist and melt in your mouth  #129316; #129316; #128151; - (20) 6g all purpose flour - (0) 10g oat fiber - (20) 22g mashed ripe banana - 1/2 tsp baking soda and baking powder - (42) 35g chickpeas - (30) 8g PB2 powdered peanut butter - (29) 8g vanilla protein powder (I used quest vanilla milkshake - (3) 1/8 cup unsweetened cashew milk - vanilla stevia drops, shake of cinnamon, vanilla extract - (5) 10g unsweetened frozen blueberries Whisk together all dry ingredients, then add to a blender on top of wet ingredients. Blend until a smooth but thick batter forms (little thicker than pancake batter). Slowly add water 1 tbsp at a time until reaches the right consistency - the trick is to add as little water as necessary for you to be able to pour it!! Use a spatula to transfer the goodness to a mini loaf pan (spray first with nonstick). Top with blueberries. If you don #8217;t have a mini loaf pan, you could use 2 nonstick muffin molds. I had to lick the spatula it was so good  #128557; Bake at 350 F for 20 minutes, check after 15 min and take out when the center is set - it will rise a good bit and then settle down. this was literally so tasty I #8217;m about to make it again today to eat tomorrow  #128557; #128151;</TEXT>

The streusel crumble topping was SO GOOD it really adds a lot to the meal. It was also super filling!! modifications on original recipe: - less ripe banana (20g/18 cal) - no PB2 or cocoa powder - 20g frozen bluebs added (10) - increased zucchini for volume (103g/10 cal) - added 3g quest vanilla milkshake protein powder (11) Cinnamon streusel topping - In a small nonstick pan, melt 1 tsp reduced calorie plant based margarine (15). Add cinnamon, butter flavor powder, caramel liquid stevia drops (or sweetener of choice), and 1/2 tbsp almond flour (23). use a spatula to evenly stir and toast the crumble.

Combine cashew milk, instant coffee and vegan creamer in a small microwave safe bowl and microwave 1 minute, then stir in stevia powder. Agar agar and water will boil into a thick syrup like gel - pour it into the bowl of hot sweetened coffee cashew milk and whisk a couple minutes until completely dissolved. Refrigerate 2-3 hours to set. white chocolate protein fluff - 4 ice cubes - 3 tbsp white chocolate skinny syrup - (32) 8g casein protein powder - (17) 2/3 cup unsweet cashew milk - (7) 2g xanthan gum Whisk together xanthan gum and protein powder in a dry bowl. Add ice cubes, skinny syrup, and cashew milk to a blender. Evenly pour protein powder/xanthan gum on top. Cover and blend on high speed 5-7 minutes. It will expand a LOT into a thick fluff. You really can #8217;t overmix this - just keep blending until it stops growing. Serve with coffee cashew milk pudding, 0 cal chocolate sauce and 2 crushed caramel rice cakes (18). Mix 3g chocolate PB2 powder (11) with a tbsp of skinny syrup and drizzle on top.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>This was a super happy accident - can #8217;t wait to to fill the bread with tuna salad, PB2 cottage cheese and SF strawberry jam, tofu scramble and cheese.. you can cut this into 3 54 calorie pieces and get creative! This will be the base of my breakfast, lunch and dinner tomorrow  #128514; https://www.reddit.com/r/1200isplenty/comments/gcey89/sometimes_messing_around_in_the_kitchen_turns/?utm_source=share amp;utm_medium=ios_app amp;utm_name=iossmf I followed this recipe to a tea (is that the expression?) but I used keto friendly zero carb whey protein isolate powder (so this is homemade zero carb bread!!!)and I added a few drops of butter flavor extract and a little sea salt on top. No other modifications were made! I whipped the egg white into stiff peaks using Ky ninja blender (the mixing bowl), and I whisked together the protein powder and psyllium husk before sprinkling it into the blender. This was a one bowl one blender recipe!! This is what it looked like before I flipped it over - I was anticipating it to be like a Jimmy Johns French bread but I was amazed when I flipped it over and it was hollow  #128561; this was painfully easy - definitely making again  #128523; https://ibb.co/KbBP9Wr</TEXT>

    <TEXT>/u/scumbagacademic gave me some winning tips to make my spring rolls come out neater and I will share them with you! The first attempt to make the spring rolls was a mess but second time was a charm. Summer rolls (92 cal): - (35) 1 sheet of rice paper roll - (23) 35g raw mango - (11) 47g thinly sliced white cabbage - (23) 43g thawed medium cooked shrimp with tails removed - (0) 1 small  #8220;knot #8221; of shirataki noodles (about 30g) - (0) small shake of Thai spice seasoning soak rice paper in lukewarm water for literally 5 seconds then drain and let it continue to soften - it will feel stiff at first but it continues to soften after you drain it. If you soak it too long, it gets slimy and won #8217;t gold together so the trick is to only soak a few seconds! Thinly slice cabbage and add to a bowl with shrimp, shirataki and Thai spice. Toss until evenly spiced. Your rice paper should be ready now - it will feel slightly sticky. Add your fillings and line up the mango evenly along the center line. Fold the short ends of the wrap (horizontally) and tuck the fillings in, then roll it up (vertically) as neatly as possible and cut in half. Served with 0 cal liquid aminos with togarashi seasoning added to dip. Salad (38 cal): - (10) 44g spring mix/spinach 50/50 blend - (14) 39g grape tomato sliced in half - (5) 28g pepperoncini - (4) 18g diced baby bella mushroom - (5) 2 tbsp sugar free skinnygirl raspberry vinaigrette Top lettuce with veggies and drizzle on dressing last. I enjoy eating my salads with chopsticks!</TEXT>

I really enjoyed it - this was my second time making your pudding  #128522; Kratom is a legal recreational/medicinal compound that has pain relieving, energizing and anti-anxiety properties and you can get different strains that have different levels of the different effects. I drink a cup every morning because it #8217;s like a caffeine-free preworkout that lets me exercise longer and I feel euphoria from it instead of pain. It #8217;s also a good appetite suppressant!</TEXT>

    <TEXT>103 cal Macrobiotic barley soup recipe: https://ibb.co/xY1WqCD This is from my favorite macrobiotic cookbook! I made kind of a shortcut version because I don #8217;t have a pressure cooker and it turned out amazing. I made 2 servings at 103 cal each, I used ginger powder instead of raw ginger, 1/4 cup pressed barley soaked overnight, baby carrots, 1 can pieces  amp; stems mushrooms saut #233;ed with onion, hatcho miso powder and I added a stalk of crushed lemongrass to the broth and removed it before adding the mushroom and onion. Really delicious and satisfying soup!! The mushroom spinach veggie dip: https://www.reddit.com/r/LowCalorieCooking/comments/gmvgl7/mushroom_spinach_smoked_paprika_dip_with_veggie/?utm_source=share amp;utm_medium=ios_app amp;utm_name=iossmf I used fat free sour cream instead of cottage cheese. Really yummy!</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I beg to differ!! I find a lot of high quality non-perishable health foods and diet foods and brand name sugar free syrup (like Torani and Jordan #8217;s) there. I have purchased chia seeds, coconut flour (same brand as Whole Foods), rice cake rolls, and keto cookie mix there (among many other good finds) that were all equal in quality to food I purchased from a big grocery store and often I find low calorie snacks there that I cannot find anywhere else. My favorite almond and cranberry puffed rice bars (70 cal) I have only ever been able to find at TJ Maxx and HomeGoods! Is it possible you may have a biased opinion against discount chain stores?</TEXT>

    <TEXT>it feels so good when a recipe idea you have turns out PERFECT the first time. These pancakes are so fluffy with a mochi texture and they are so easy to flip - the batter was the exact right consistency so next time I think I #8217;ll do 3 big pancakes!! I hope you enjoy this recipe  #129395; I purchased the Ube Mochi pancake mix from Trader Joe #8217;s - so worth it 10/10! Bought it because another redditor shared their pancake stack  #128525; you can substitute tapioca or Mochi flour with an extra 1/4 tsp baking powder, or use regular pancake mix if that #8217;s what you got but the texture will be like a regular pancake 6 main ingredients: - 20g Oat Fiber - 1/4 tsp baking soda - (94) 32g (3 tbsp) Ube Mochi Pancake Mix - (24) 27g mashed ripe banana - (25) 3 tbsp liquid egg whites - 4 tbsp water - 1 tbsp birthday cake skinny syrup Heat nonstick pan on medium heat. Whisk together all dry ingredients. Mash banana and egg white together in a different bowl until smooth. Add all liquids to bowl of dry ingredients and combine - pancake mix will be very thick but pourable! Cook pancakes 2-3 minutes per side. 55 cal cantaloupe cream protein frappe with preworkout jelly - (5) 85g raspberry jelly set with preworkout powder added - (29) 87g cantaloupe melon - (21) 6g quest vanilla milkshake protein powder - 5 ice cubes - 1/2 cup water - 1 tbsp birthday cake skinny syrup add jello to the bottom of a glass. Blend together the rest of the ingredients and serve poured over jelly. It #8217;s fun to suck the jelly up the straw and this drink is very refreshing!</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I hope you like it!! If you like jelly and pudding I recommend picking up some agar agar - you can set any liquid into jelly with it (and throw it in the blender for a jelly drink) and it #8217;s 0 cal because it #8217;s all insoluble fiber. You can also use arrowroot powder to make cashew/almondmilk pudding! Glucomannan pudding is more edible with mashed banana and PB2 added but the texture is still..not awesome</TEXT>

    <TEXT>this recipe is inspired by a dear friend of mine from peach! Only 5 INGREDIENTS and it #8217;s a great way to repurpose leftover Chinese food - you can sub with cabbage and liquid aminos if you don #8217;t have mu shu vegetables. It #8217;s my favorite low calorie Chinese food because it #8217;s just cabbage with mushroom, broccoli and green onion with a little scrambled egg. I estimated 45 cal for 100g mu shu vegetable - I ate all the protein out the night before so the leftovers were lower cal  #129395; - (0) 1 bag miracle noodle shirataki fettuccine - (60) 1 quorn meatless chick #8217;n fillet - (45) 100g leftover mu shu cabbage and veg - (25) 55g sliced envy apple - (3) 9g green onion and Trader Joe #8217;s mushroom umami seasoning heat nonstick pan over medium heat and  #8220;dry fry #8221; shirataki - this makes the texture more like pasta and removes the funky shirataki smell. Microwave frozen quorn fillet 45 seconds and slice into little strips (it #8217;ll finish cooking in the pan). Add mu shu vegetables and quorn and let it saut #233; with a little nonstick spray until the edges of the quorn are crisped. Add apple and a shake of mushroom umami seasoning and cook 2-3 more minutes. The apple with the sweet soy from the mu shu is a great flavor pairing! Serve topped with green onion.</TEXT>

Heat and lightly spray a nonstick pan w/ cooking spray - first stir fry the zucchini for 5 min because it takes longer to cook. Add mushroom and bell pepper and cook another 2-3 minutes. I use medium high heat so it crisps up the veggies. Add smart ground last and seasonings. cook another 2 min and make sure the seasoning is evenly distributed. Serve topped with tzaziki! It balances out the spice of the sambal oelek really nicely!</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I made a meal plan w/ 3 low cal meals and 2 snacks set at timed intervals to try and combat my bulimia, but I had a hard time waiting from 2pm to 5pm to eat so I binged and purged. Yesterday was b/p free, I am determined to get 2 days in a row and I #8217;m not going to stop trying new things to stop b/p until I can get a clean streak. Not trying to punish myself and feel even worse, so I #8217;m trying to focus on what I CAN do (exercise and meal plan) instead. In a vicious cycle where I binge on safe food right after my ambien hits, not purge because I #8217;m too tired, anguish on the scale the next day and exercising for 2 and a half hours to see if I can sweat back down to yesterday #8217;s weight. Feeling trapped.</TEXT>

PB sauce - 5g PB2 + sugar free maple syrup. SinFit brand blueberry syrup. Topped w/ 30g fresh blueberries and 36g frozen blackberries. My trick is to use 45g cold sugar free Oregon spiced chai (or cold sweetener chai tea) instead of water!! The cake is super moist and has a great chai flavor that pairs well with the berries.</TEXT>

Really moist too! - 16g oat fiber - 15g erythritol - 1g baking powder - 3g glucomannan powder - 1 tsp matcha powder (5) - 28g unsweetened applesauce (12) - 1/2 tsp vanilla extract (1) - 1 tbsp skinny syrup (I used white chocolate) whisk all dry. Whisk all wet in a separate mixing bowl and pour into dry. You will have a fluffy THICK cake batter - this is what we want  #128548; spray your microwave safe baking dish with nonstick, pour in the mug cake batter and microwave 1 min 30 sec. let cool The French toast: - 55g soon or silken tofu (26) - 1 tbsp sugar free maple syrup - 1 tbsp skinny syrup (white choc) - 1 tsp matcha powder (5) - 15g coconut cream (30) Combine all ingredients in the blender. Pour into a shallow bowl. Cut your cake in half horizontally (separate into 2 layers) and cut each of those pieces in half. Heat a nonstick pan over medium high heat, spray with nonstick, dip each piece of cake in the batter and cook until toasted on both sides. Serve topped with remaining batter This  #8220;batter #8221; also makes an amazing fruit dip or pancake topping! You can add chocolate instead of matcha, change up the skinny syrup, get creative.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>my dear friend sent me this recipe and I told her I would make it and share it to Reddit! Both the brownie and the custard are delicious on their own, but they #8217;re even better together!! Custard (86): - 10g sugar free chocolate pudding mix (32) - 1/2 cup unsweetened cashew milk (13) - 120g canned pumpkin (41) - 6 tbsp stevia powder Whisk pudding mix into cashew milk and let it thicken for 5 minutes in the fridge. Add pumpkin, stevia, and pudding to a blender and blend until smooth. It will firm up a little bit in the fridge but keep it #8217;s perfect smooth pudding texture. Pumpkin Brownie (93 cal for whole pan - spoon for scale) - 24g oat fiber (1/4 cup) - pinch of baking powder - 3g cacao powder (13) - 7g sugar free chocolate pudding mix (22) - 1/4 cup stevia powder - 120g canned pumpkin (41) - 1 tbsp egg white (8) - 20g unsweetened applesauce (9) - 30g skinny syrup (I used white choc) Whisk together all dry ingredients. Whisk together all wet ingredients. Fold wet into dry until evenly mixed. Batter will be very thick, this is good! Add parchment paper and a little nonstick spray to a loaf pan. Transfer batter to loaf pan and smooth the surface with a spatula. Bake 15-20 minutes (less time = fudgier, more time = cakier). I did 17 minutes for a fudgy center and cakey surface. Serve with custard either hot or chilled! Custard is also delicious warm. Recipe also on my Instagram @lowcalorieyum</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Yes - I actually took before and after pictures! I was so excited I made it to 7 days because my jawline was looking slimmer, my skin was more even and my glands weren #8217;t so swollen I looked like a snake trying to swallow an egg lol. Over the past 6 months the longest I #8217;ve gone without purging was 7 days in December and 13 days in March. :( I purge almost every day, I #8217;m lucky to get 2 purge free days a week. I really want to get another streak but I get so hungry after over exercising and restricting that I usually snap after I leave the gym to b/p. It #8217;s a horrible cycle and I can tell you from first hand experience that restricting and over exercising will only make it worse. One thing that helped me immensely was using the app SHYE (see how you eat) and actually trying to eat something at all the meal times suggested by the app and not eat outside those times. I find eating at regular intervals interrupts my b/p cycle because I don #8217;t want to purge the  #8220;good #8221; food I decided I should have and I look forward to mealtimes. Meal planning helps a lot too. Whenever I deviate from  #8220;the plan #8221; it always ends in disaster lmao, just sticking to it and trusting it has helped me avoid potential binges in the past - knowing you will eat again and knowing what you #8217;ll have gave me some security that contradicts the feelings you have that 1. The food you want is taboo and 2. You #8217;ll never get to enjoy it again. When I plan meals that satisfy my cravings like spicy food or healthy desserts I don #8217;t feel like I #8217;m making a compromise i guess. Now that I know what works for me, I just have to believe that I deserve to feel good in my body and I deserve my meal plan - it #8217;s really hard to not sabotage myself with instant gratification delivery or fast food because I feel like I  #8220;deserve #8221; to purge and feel like shit. You gotta challenge those beliefs. If it helps I also lose weight faster when I eat 3 small meals a day because I #8217;m not binging - just give it a chance to work :)</TEXT>

    <TEXT>This is a perfectly thick and creamy pudding and it takes less than 15 minutes to make! You can use cornstarch instead of arrowroot powder if that #8217;s what you have. I used a frozen banana but you can use a fresh one too! This has the same thick texture as jello pudding. - 1.5 cups unsweetened cashew milk (38) - 2.5 tbsp arrowroot powder (12) - 50g banana (45) - 1/2 scoop chocolate peanut butter vegan power pro protein powder (49) - optional: stevia drops or skinny syrup for extra sweetness 1. Combine 1 cup of your cashewmilk, banana, protein powder in a blender until smooth. Add mixture to a small pot and heat to a low simmer. 2. Whisk arrowroot powder in remaining 1/2 cup of cashew milk until it dissolves. 3. Pour arrowroot mixture into simmering pudding mix and continue to simmer and whisk until mixture starts to thicken. When it #8217;s ready to set in the fridge, pudding will be thick and stick to the back of a spoon. 4. Transfer pudding into a bowl, cover, and let set in fridge until cool and thick - I let mine sit overnight but it should be ready to enjoy in 2-3 minutes Optional toppings: - 55g fresh strawberry (16) - 1 tbsp cocowhip (15)</TEXT>

    <TEXT>- 1 medium Japanese eggplant (121g peeled, 36 cal) - 92g broccoli (29) - 121g canned diced roasted garlic tomato (25) - 100g vegi rice cauliflower with broccoli (1/2 package 18 cal) - 28g roasted garlic sauerkraut (10) - 48g green onion (16) 1. Preheat oven to 400 F. Cut Japanese eggplant in half vertically down center and place skin side down on a lightly sprayed baking sheet. Sprinkle with sea salt and let sit 5 min to allow salt to draw moisture from eggplant. 2. Add raw broccoli (cut into small pieces) to pan with 1/3 cup water on medium high heat and steam broccoli until water is evaporated. 3. Roast eggplant in oven 10-15 minutes. Remove from oven and wait for it to cool long enough to peel the skin off - it #8217;ll easily peel (best eggplant hack). Weigh roasted eggplant without peel and cut into bite size pieces to pan with broccoli. 4. add sauerkraut, tomato, green onions, and vegi rice. Season to taste however you like (I did sea salt and  #8220;Nashville hot chicken seasoning #8221; w/ cayenne and paprika to make it spicy). Serve and enjoy hot!</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Yields 8 super fluffy mini pancakes!! - 20g oat fiber - 12g arrowhead mills protein pancake mix (42) - 4g self rising flour (13) - 1/4 tsp baking powder - 2 tbsp erythritol - 42g fat free cottage cheese (26) - 2 tbsp egg white (17) - 2 tbsp skinny syrup - 2 tbsp water - 40g frozen raspberries (26) Preheat nonstick pan over medium high heat. Whisk together all dry ingredients. Mash cottage cheese in a separate bowl until curds are mostly smooth. Add egg white, skinny syrup and water to bowl with cottage cheese and whisk together. Fold in frozen raspberries, reserving some to put on top. These pancakes take a little longer to cook per side than the average pancake and they #8217;re a little more delicate, so be patient and flip gently!! I promise they are worth the extra TLC. This recipe works best with 3 #8221; pancakes, any bigger and they might be tricky to flip! Enjoy topped with raspberries and sugar free pancake syrup.</TEXT>

Add wet to dry, whisk into a batter (will foam up). Microwave 2 minutes.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>The coconut flour and protein powder thickens it - flavor is very smooth and yummy, no tofu taste at all. I have another recipe for vegan edible cookie dough posted here that used applesauce as a base and it #8217;s more like a true cookie dough but it #8217;s more calorie dense and better for a topping (put it on oatmeal or nice cream) - this is more protein and it #8217;s less calorie dense - I had it as a stand-alone breakfast! Would also probably be yummy spread on safe pancakes or waffles or as a dip for fruit</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I am not sure - self rising flour helps a lot w vegan baking without the dairy products to make it rise! Oat fiber doesn #8217;t really behave like flour in baking recipes, but if you add reg flour 2:1 ratio the oat fiber adds volume while the reg flour bakes like normal. If you did 1/8 cup flour 1/8 cup vegan protein powder I bet that would totally work!! I would add a couple tbs of applesauce too because the oat fiber can be a little dry  #128076; Also if you are gluten free you could use tapioca flour, almond flour or coconut flour instead of self rising and do 2 tsp baking powder</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Sweet Acorn squash souffle #769;  #128150; dont know what 2 do with your squash? I microwave it for 6 minutes, scoop it into a Tupperware and it #8217;s all prepped to go into recipes for the week! This recipe is so deceptively easy and comes together in the blender. Crust: - 1/2 piece of my oat fiber banana bread (43) ** you can use a crumbled oat fiber mug cake as crust, crushed cookies or crackers - whatever you want! Since the souffle #769; batter is wet you do not have to add any moisture to crust, if you want you could even go crustless! Souffle #769;: - 75g acorn squash (30) - 2 tbsp egg white (17) - 10g erythritol - 5g oat fiber - 3g tapioca flour (11) - ginger powder, cinnamon, pumpkin pit spice - 1/2 tsp baking powder - optional: English toffee stevia drops Preheat oven to 350 F. Lightly spray baking dish or line with parchment paper. Combine all ingredients for souffle #769; in blender, blend until smooth, pour over crust, bake 20-25 minutes until top is golden. It will rise in the oven and settle back down when it cools. This was so good I #8217;m making it again tomorrow!</TEXT>

    <TEXT>as soon as I took the first bite I was so hype to share this recipe!! ready in about 5 minutes for when you want a sweet breakfast in a flash. Or you can bake it like I did this morning - 350 F for 25 minutes. I think it has a nice sweetness but I added sugar free maple syrup, cinnamon and apple pie spice on top just because. 1 tsp baking powder 22g oat fiber (75) 16g quick oats (0) 13g erythritol (can sub stevia) (25) 3 tbsp egg white (27) 30g nonfat plain green yogurt (36) 35g mashed ripe banana + 10g garnish (2) 2 tbsp unsweet almond milk 2 tbsp water optional: few drops cake batter flavoring, 7-8 drops English toffee liquid stevia sweetener), additional ~10g thinly sliced banana for garnish mix dry ingredients thoroughly (oat fiber, monkfruit sweetener, oatmeal, baking powder). In another bowl, mash banana then add yogurt, egg white, cashew milk, water and any liquid sweeteners. Whisk until smooth and add to dry ingredients - will resemble pancake batter. Microwave 2.5 minutes OR bake 25 minutes at 350F! It #8217;s rockin both ways, I only bake it because it stays warm longer.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>the trick is microwaving the pancakes for 25 sec as soon as they #8217;re done cooking because they fluff up even MORE - I think it #8217;s the egg whites but it could be maybelline... anyway the assembly of these pancakes requires just a blender, a bowl, and a nonstick pan  #128548; pulsing all the dry ingredients together in the ninja bullet is the easiest way to make sure everything is even. - 22g oat fiber - 2 tbsp skinny syrup - 10g erythritol/monkfruit - 1 tsp baking powder - 38g egg white (21) - 1g psyllium husk powder (3) - 1g glucomannan powder (0) - 2g ground flax seed (11) - 26g raspberries - optional: 3g white chocolate chips (16), 9 drops English toffee liquid stevia Pulse oat fiber, erythritol, baking powder, flax meal, psyllium husk, glucomannan in dry blender into fine powder. Add raspberries to bowl and cut into little pieces with a spoon (set aside 1 for garnish). Add skinny syrup and egg whites to raspberries and mix smooth, whisk in dry ingredients (no additional liquids needed). makes 4 small pancakes that cook 3-4 min per side over medium heat - they take a little longer to cook per side than the average pancake but it #8217;s worth it!! 48 calories for all 4 without chocolate chips. you can use psyllium husk, glucomannan and xanthan gum semi interchangeably so if you only have one of them see if you can substitute it in! I #8217;ve found this ratio best but please do experiment. If you like them more moist, add a tbsp of unsweetened applesauce to the batter.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>The secret ingredient is riced cauliflower and no you can #8217;t taste it at ALL!! The key is to prep it the night before and let it set overnight - pop it in the oven the next morning for perfection  #128150; this does have egg white in it - microwaving it before you put it in the fridge makes it fluff up at LOT and partially cooks the steel cut oats so they #8217;re super soft and fluffy when you bake them the next day. This recipe works best with riced cauliflower that is NOT frozen so it #8217;s not too wet - I buy a head of cauliflower and pulse it in the food processor for my recipes. - 85g riced cauliflower (20) - 80g peeled Apple (38) - 2 tbsp caramel vanilla skinny syrup - apple pie spice to taste - 1 tbsp nut pods plant based creamer (10) - 15g steel cut oats (60) - 3 tbsp egg white (25) - 4g protein pancake mix (14) - 2 tbsp fat free whipped cream (5) 1. Peel apple, cut 2/3 into small pieces and slice remaining apple for garnish 2. Add steel cut oats to oven safe baking dish and pour over 1/2 cup boiling hot water. Stir in cauliflower, pancake mix, skinny syrup and creamer - season with apple pie spice. 3. Stir in egg whites until mix is smooth. Top with apples for garnish and additional apple pie spice. 4. Microwave 2 minutes - it will fluff up a lot! 5. Cover with tin foil and let set in fridge overnight. 6. Preheat oven to 350 F. Bake 25 minutes. Let cool, top with whipped cream and enjoy!</TEXT>

    <TEXT>78 cal without cereal topping!! This recipe yields 2 servings - whole recipe is 156 cal. All you need is a blender and a small pot to simmer! I enjoy this pudding warm like a custard as well as chilled!! - 60g banana (54) - 25g pure pumpkin pur #233;e (10) - pumpkin pie spice and English toffee stevia drops - 1.5 cups cashew milk (34) - 1/2 scoop vanilla plant based protein powder (46) - 18g arrowroot powder (12) 1. Whisk arrowroot powder into 1/2 cup cold almond milk. Set aside. 2. To blender, add banana, pumpkin, protein powder, 1 cup almond milk, pumpkin pie spice and stevia drops. Blend until smooth.

    <TEXT>Yummy and easy twist on protein fluff!! Adding the yogurt gives it a creamier meltier texture but you still get the volume of a trad protein fluff  #128150; Fluff: - 1/4 cup dragonfruit skinny syrup (or any fruit flavor, can sub cashew milk) - 1 frozen strawberry yogurt tube (50) - 2g xanthan gum (7) - 8g casein unflavored protein powder (29) - 4 ice cubes Toppings: - 1 gt; sprinkles - 20g blueberries (11) - 30g raspberries (14) Whisk together xanthan gum and casein powder. Add dragonfruit syrup, 4 ice cubes, frozen yogurt tube to food processor and pulse for a second just to combine (helps powders clump less). Sprinkle around the casein/xanthan gum mix and blend on high for a looooong time (4/5 minutes) - will triple in size. Transfer to a bowl, add fresh fruit and freeze until you #8217;re ready to enjoy! Take it out to thaw for 15 minutes before digging in.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>This 45 cal stir fry is very high volume and tasty!! Season with your fav seasonings - I used butter spray and Tabasco sauce  #9829; #65039; - 1 bag miracle noodle fettuccine Shirataki - 153g diced celery (20) - 3 tbsp egg white (25) Drain shirataki and microwave 2 minutes (removes shirataki smell and gives it a more pasta like texture). Stir fry celery, season to taste. Add shirataki to pan. Stir fry until thoroughly heated, push noodles and veggies to side and add egg white to space in the pan. Scramble and then mix thoroughly, add any additional seasonings and enjoy!</TEXT>
