    <TITLE>[TOMT] [MOVIE] Horror/Scifi movie from pre-1984</TITLE>
    <DATE>2013-12-12 16:02:04</DATE>
    <TEXT>I'm trying to figure out a movie I saw a few times as a kid, hopefully someone here might be able to figure it out. It probably is from pre-1984. It was a low(er) budget scifi movie that (as far as I can remember) was about a space-prisoner transport ship that crashes outside some average rural American community in the fall/winter, and there were three monster aliens that escaped and started killing off the townspeople. The alien cop takes the form of a human and hunts the three aliens with the help of a human woman (she doesn't know he's an alien). She was probably a reporter or a cop. Each monster he kills, he uses something from that to kill the next one. I remember one had lobster claws, and he took the poison from that one to kill the next one, etc. The end of the movie, the aliens human disguise is gone, and he's in the shadows and asks the woman not to approach him, but she does anyway, and sees he's a creepy looking creature with bulging orange eyes. Then a cop blasts him with a shotgun. The end. Anyone have any ideas? This movie creeped me out as a kid, and I'd love to find it again and see how bad it really was.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I assume that Arlovski spent that fight getting over being back in the UFC, he'll probably be back to himself next fight. Too bad for Schaub, if he had realized how nervous Arlovski actually was, he might have actually pushed forward. I still think Schaub won that one, regardless of how bad the actual fight was.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>So I was watching episode 10 - at the start, why did the LAST truck to arrive at the Hansen's Disease center have to drive through a locked gate? Did the driver of the second to last truck get out and lock it behind him, and the driver of the last truck was like "locked gate? Screw it".</TEXT>

    <TEXT>My thoughts as I was watching **Syzygy** - Apparently the episode was named when a cat jumped up on the keyboard. * I grew up in the part of the country this episode takes place in, and these people don''t sound remotely like they are from that area. Maine and New Hampshire are constantly fighting for first place in the "America's Worst Accent" Olympics. * Van Wilder ends up dead after trying to do a good deed. Scully is pissed about whatever. The otherwise religious Scully ain't buying the religious stuff. Could it be... SATAN? * So... the local high school's satanic goat mascot is just coincidence?  #8220;Maybe if we weren #8217;t virgins we wouldn #8217;t be so scared #8221;  #8211; you know, I think you #8217;re right.

    <TEXT>There has been a fair amount of critiquing, if not complaining, earlier on (valid or not, I'm not judging), but as someone who falls squarely into the demo for the podcast, I love it. More than anything, I love that Kumail and his guests are full willing to point out some of the stupid and goofy shit that happens in each episode, while really respecting the show. That really makes the podcast for me. I have tried to listen to a podcast involving another old show (a pretty good show, in fact, but will remain nameless so I don't "out" the podcast), but damn, the hosts were so fanboyish and serious in their fan-love for the show they were talking about, they completely overlooked some of the ridiculousness and raved about the "brilliant" plot and were just so earnest about the whole effort that I couldn't handle it. Meanwhile I'm seeing all of the nutty things that make no sense in each episode, but were never commented on. You can still be a fan and make fun of the stuff in the show that doesn't make sense or might be unintentionally funny. Also, I love the banter, and c'mon, we've all seen the episode at least once, or we wouldn't be listening (and if you didn't watch an episode, why are you listening) so we don't need a detailed rundown of plot points from start to finish. Something that I've always hated in other tv show podcasts, and I'm grateful that Kumail and co. skips them or just does a basic treatment, and brings up details as necessary as the conversation goes forward. If you are talking to some of your friends about an episode of a show you've seen, do you run down the plot points and storyline? No. You talk about the stuff you liked, the stuff you thought was awesome, the stuff you hated, and other shows and other random things that the episode reminded you of. Since I obviously land right in the bullseye of the target demo and Kumail's sense of humor is right up my alley, I can't really offer much in the way of critique except to remind Kumail - this is your thing, man, don't let the whiners put pressure on you to change things up unless it actually makes sense to do so. I love it as is. Unlike all the other podcasts out there, it's like hanging out listening to friends talk about a show you like, and that's all I really want. Keep it up!</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Despite cringing furiously at the idea of Melrose Place, I hit play on episode 2, and have listened to about half so far. I could totally listen along with a show with you guys. BUT I don't think I can bring myself to actually watch Melrose Place. But later on, different show, yeah, I could see that. Melrose Place... that's a bit of a tough sell. I don't really have any criticisms, every podcast does things differently. Maybe your intro sounded a bit contrived, like you were reading but trying to sound like you were just talking, and almost pulled it off, just came up a bit short. And the JRE riff at the start should probably be changed, it's just too much. So, I'm sold on the idea of you guys doing a podcast and your style, I'd listen. But.. Melrose Place... I don't know if I can get over that.</TEXT>

I noticed it on Netflix and kept putting it off until I found the podcast the week it started.

    <TEXT>**Piper Maru** - What a great episode! Seeing the soldier actually lift the gate to let Scully through seemed strange, like it was just a giant prop (probably was). I don't think I've ever seen a gate that wasn't automatic. Mulder, don't touch the slimy Frenchman! Don't... oh, too late. Am I the only one that thought it was strange that the Frenchman's wife ran away from him about 30 seconds after him acting creepy? In reality, isn't that a little strange, unless he had a history of smacking her around? Wow, Geraldine has an old school musket under the desk! (Oh, guess that's with a "J") Hmm.

Logic being, you have time to watch and comment on the x files episode up front (also giving us time to comment before the podcast, and giving Kumail plenty of time to catch up on reddit comments before his podcast), and then comment on the podcast episode later. So, all in the same place, easy reference.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Point being, I don't think that very many people want two identical topics for each episode (one for the show, one for the corresponding podcast episode). That's all. One thread for both the podcast and the episode, put up whenever. Although, since we normally watch the episode before the podcast ep is up, I'd prefer it to be up before the podcast episode, but I'm fine with going with whatever everyone else wants to do. Mostly, I'm just happy to be here. For a while there were two identical posts, one for the show episode, one for the podcast episode, and that was confusing.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I tried to watch Millennium twice. Once on TV during the first run, I think I was in college and wasn't able to follow it, then I tried it about 2007 and just couldn't take it seriously. The whole 1999 end of the world thing, the occult conspiracy, and the rise of the serial killer things seemed so hackneyed after the cultural shift after 9/11. Millennium just seemed dated and out of touch at that point.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Court ranks, bushi alliances, and calendar would probably take some work, but it will go on the list. I think in Ep116-117, the point is that the "name" is preserved and bestowed like a corporation. People would be adopted in to the "family" to preserve the name, which carries all the political/social cachet (rank/privilege/or historical value), and people adopted in would either be doing it on behalf of their own clan and/or to be given headship of their own clan if they were not the first son, or maybe even as a simple social boost conferred on them to get a better "name". There were a lot of reasons. For example Mori Motoharu and Takakage were adopted in to other clans to take them over on behalf of the Mori, but also to install them as heads of their own clans. They were no longer part of "Mori Inc.", but they were a benefit as allies, and as younger sons, also gained position as clan leaders. It was less about the individual name, and more about continuing to extend the "family" name into the future, even if the majority of members after a certain point were not even related to the founders. In the case of Motoharu and Takakage, they gave up the Mori name, but in order to benefit it. Not sure if that directly addresses the question... And, yeah, 2016 should see us with some pretty good interviews.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>This is pretty much all fiction. The Samurai were a social class you were pretty much born into by the Edo period. You couldn't just "become" a Samurai. Prior to the Edo period, it was more fluid. Hideyoshi stopped social mobility, making it a much more strict social order. You were a Samurai or you weren't at that point. It wasn't so much that he gave dirt grubbing peasants the option of staying a farmer or becoming a Samurai, but it was mostly to tell the country Samurai, "either you stick to the land and give up your swords, or you fall under a Daimyo" - it was his way of taking the power out of the countryside and getting it under his government. All the notions of honor and fidelity and killing yourself when your lord dies is mostly BS. You might want to check out the Samurai Archives podcast, there are a few episodes that tackle these myths and misconceptions.</TEXT>

    <TITLE>The Samurai Archives Japanese History Podcast</TITLE>
    <DATE>2016-05-13 19:36:29</DATE>
    <TEXT>Hi everyone! I didn't see any Japanese history podcasts anywhere here, so I'm tossing out ours. We cover Japanese history from stone age Japan to generally the end of the 19th century, although we've touched on WWII, and our (obvious) focus is the history of the Samurai. It's basically the podcast for samurai-archives.com. Our episodes are quite rangy, we go from straight up academic discourse on historical events, to breaking out the whiskey and debating historical douchebaggery of Samurai warlords. We also try to mix in other disciplines, including philosophy and psychology, and do interviews as well. We've had on armor experts, martial artists, academics, other history podcasters, and have covered academic conferences. We keep Japanese history as a base, but get quite broad, so there is usually something for everyone. Questions, comments, and so on are welcome. Itunes: https://itunes.apple.com/us/podcast/samurai-archives-japanese/id430277324?mt=2 *Most recent 115 episodes* Website: http://samuraipodcast.com/ *All episodes* Twitter: http://www.twitter.com/samuraiarchives Reddit: r/samuraipodcast/ Facebook: https://www.facebook.com/Samurai-Archives-104533213984/</TEXT>

    <TEXT>First off, the fact that I have to watch the X-Files on Hulu instead of Netflix sucks, because I had never intended to actually ever get a subscription to Hulu. But that #8217;s my only option at this point. So far season seven seems to be extremely uneven; terrible episodes mixed with great episodes mixed with quirky one-offs. My running commentary as I watch: Right from the start the music is telling me this is going to be one of those  #8220;quirky #8221; episodes:  #8220;The Mystery of the Mouth Stealer #8221;! Hey! Will Sasso! Wait #8230; Am I to believe that Anson found a genie wrapped up in a magic carpet in a storage unit? Who wrote this? What sort of Sherlock Holmes magic caused Mulder to realize there was a Genie granting wishes? Giant plot hole. Predicable ending, I saw Mulder #8217;s third wish a mile away. All in all, a typical quirk episode. Not great, not terrible. Better than the worst episodes of the season, but not as good as, say  #8220;Brand X (with Jigsaw) #8221; or  #8220;Fight Club #8221;. That being said, the fact that Mulder just sort of pulls the idea of a Genie straight out of the depths of his ass truly boggles my mind. Worst writing ever.</TEXT>

    <TITLE>Do antidepressants cause any permanent changes in the brain that persist even after stopping them?</TITLE>
    <DATE>2018-11-04 17:38:23</DATE>
    <TEXT>Just curious if we know if/what changes may be permanent. Obviously there are short term changes, or changes that take place while a person is actively taking antidepressants, but is there any evidence of changes beneficial, toxic, or otherwise from long term use that persist even after you stop? Examples could be personality changes, enlargement or shrinking of brain structures, neurogenesis or neurotoxicity, whatever. My understanding is that there are probably beneficial changes that come from relieving the physical stress on the brain caused by depression - anything else?</TEXT>

    <DATE>2019-06-05 16:11:33</DATE>
    <TEXT>I'm trying to figure out which Samurai film has two samurai warriors in full armor engage in one on one combat on the field of battle in front of both armies, and one grapples the other to the ground and kills him with a knife. I believe the context was that one calls out the other, so rather than the two armies battling, the two Samurai fight each other in front of the armies. It was a color movie, pre-2000, possibly Akira Kurosawa, but I'm not sure. And if a Youtube link exists, that would be great too.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>The reason for this is because they have absolutely no idea what they're talking about. By the 16th century, Japan was fielding armies as large or larger than any country in Europe at the time. Battle strategy was absolutely essential to survival for a Sengoku Daimyo. Calling out other samurai to fight one on one was a thing of the distant past by then. In the entire 16th century there's only a couple examples, and they are notable because it never happened. By 1600, the lead up to the battle of Sekigahara involved 200,000 men engaged in battle and castle sieges across the country, with the decisive battle taking place in October of 1600, with probably over 25,000 dead. It's all nonsensical gibberish.</TEXT>

And a random undergraduate degree like history, political science, or psychology *only* qualifies to get you in the door. And since you won't qualify for a job requiring intellect with a random undergraduate degree, you'll be doing work that doesn't require intellect, it requires you to grind meaningless details for 8 hours a day, 40 hours a week.

    <TEXT> gt; The warning about items not transferring when changing ships or tools is super obtuse, especially since there #8217;s no indication that transferring can (or even should) be happening at that point. Honestly, it feels like there should be a post-exchange step or something where transferring occurs. I had this happen too. What does this even mean? I was trying to buy an exploration frigate - they don't actually hold anything, so there is nothing to transfer, and I was just buying it, you can't exchange anything for them.

    <TEXT>I'm also on Xbox One - and ZERO space stations ever show up in my teleport list anymore. Only my bases. Makes it impossible to try to fly to the center while also teleporting back to my base. I have to build a base before I teleport, otherwise I can't teleport back to where I left off. Very annoying. The ability to filter is completely gone.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Has anyone else had this happen? In both Euclid and and Elkupalos galaxies I have found systems that were obviously discovered by someone else based on the names, but show me as the new discoverer, and allows me to overwrite the name - in other words, there is no indication that anyone has been there, but the name of the system and the names of the planets are obviously named by someone and not random. I just came across "Eugene" system, which held planets Dixie and Pixie. Another system I found was JasonIUSA. I don't think any of that comes up randomly for systems or planets. I'm wondering if people who haven't played in a long time are losing their claims, or what's going on. I'm on Xbox One.</TEXT>

It was a good match, but zero intellectual connection. Another old girldfriend was an ISTJ - there was nothing there, no connection at all. We were both utterly miserable almost from the start. But me being an indecisive INTP let it go for a little over a year. A long, miserable year.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>This is not historically accurate. "Ninja" weren't a separate class of trained martial artist assassins in black pajamas. They weren't even known as ninja, they were "Shinobi", which were simply another word for spies. There was no such thing as an assassin clan of ninja that farmed out their services. That's just not historically accurate at all. There was no mountain clan of assassin spies who offered services, but just Samurai who would infiltrate other clan's lands as a spy. This whole black pajama wearing assassin clan ninja thing was a fiction that came later, and really isn't even connected to the Shiniobi, except as an inspiration. This is a huge misconception, unfortunately no one chooses to actually read a book.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Do a DNA test through 23andMe and [Ancestry.com](https://Ancestry.com). You'll get matched with hundreds or thousands of relatives, and also have your mother do one, it will tell you which relatives are related to you via your father that way. Then start contacting your closest relatives on your father's side. You'll find it eventually. I have over 2000 relatives showing, and about 10 people who are second cousins or closer. People who do these tests are usually interested in genealogy, and will be able to help you out. I'd say get this in process while you do the rest of the stuff.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Every time I sync my iPod Touch for about the past 6-8 months iTunes deletes every podcast episode on my iPod, and then proceeds to re-add them to the iPod. This has been driving me crazy. Instead of a 1-4 minute sync, the sync now takes 40 minutes. I have googled this and can't find an answer, and would really appreciate help. Windows 10 laptop, currently iTunes version 12.10.6.2. I never changed any settings as far as I know, but this started suddenly around 6-8 months ago, after 9-10 years with no problems.

    <TEXT>The reason that Tsunetomo wrote the entire book was because he was let go by the new lord of the clan he worked for when the new lord became of age (the lord found Tsunetomo to be a hard-headed and obnoxious old man with a hard-on for the good old days of yore, and his contemporaries agreed) so Tsunetomo wrote the book which amounts to a "You yung'uns get off my lawn!". He was a bitter old man angry because law forbid him to kill himself when his old lord died, and who hated the "modern" times that he lived in, and wanted a return to the time of wars that he never experienced. That's the historical facts, but everyone \*not\* in Japan has romanticized and blown his mostly forgotten book out of proportion. His book was long dead and forgotten until Imperial Japan resurrected it before WWII. It should all be taken with a mountain of salt. Side Note: Bushido was invented during the Edo period, long after the wars were over to justify the existence of a mostly useless warrior class in peaceful times.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>No, knowledge isn't passed on genetically. One could theorize that there would be side effects that would benefit future offspring: educated children will theoretically prefer educated spouses over uneducated ones, so over a number of generations if "intelligent" people are hooking up, the offspring would in theory benefit from the genetic components of intelligence that are passed on (since you need at least a little extra intelligence to get an advanced education). Also education raises socioeconomic status, so offspring would gain from those benefits, like not going to terrible schools, probably not living in a place with lead based paint to eat, better food, less environmental stress, less mental health problems. The sum total of this benefit over generations would probably at least prevent cognitive declines.</TEXT>

    <TITLE>Does the Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle describe a literal or figurative effect?</TITLE>
    <DATE>2020-07-02 15:25:30</DATE>
    <TEXT>At the most basic level, the Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle is usually described as observing something changes it. Is this literal, as in the instrument you use to observe it bumps it and changes its velocity/location etc? Or is this a more woo woo particle physics effect where something resolves or happens by the simple act of observation? If you blindfold a person next to a pool table, give them a pool cue, and have them locate the balls on the table with the cue (with the balls moving or not), they will locate them by hitting them, but in the act of "observing" (hitting them), their location is then changed. Is this a representative example of the Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle? There is a lot of weirdness and woo woo around how people understand what the Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle actually is, so a basic and descriptive science answer would be great.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>During the Sengoku period, the Samurai-Daimyo relationship was *very* quid pro quo. The vassals followed as long as the Daimyo provided. And in most cases "provided" meant land. Daimyo fought constantly during the Sengoku for land for their vassals, not so much because they were trying to "take over the map". Takeda Shingen kept going North into Shinano not just to have epic battles with Uesugi Kenshin, but for land and sea access for his vassals. They needed land, and they needed salt, and if he couldn't provide, they'd get rid of him, just like he did with his own father. The whole Bushido concept of a Samurai would die for his lord or do anything for his lord is all Edo period invention. If the guy above you doesn't provide, you don't do what he says. And in a lot of cases that meant that the lord would find himself on the wrong side of a sharp blade.</TEXT>

Proactively encouraging video games and anime can backfire, considering most people rarely read the rules and rarely consider what they are posting. I have spent the past 4 years deleting the most random video game, anime, and martial arts nonsense you could imagine. My pie in the sky dream would be for this sub to be exclusively about *history* in whatever context, but again, the volume of weird random tangentially related stuff like Samurai T-shirts and electronic Euromusic from youtube layed over an image of a temple, or pictures of ahistorical robo-demons in Japanese armor has been overwhelming. I'm mainly looking to trim out that stuff and leave all of the history, in whatever form. If you scroll through the history of this sub, you'll see it's awful light on straight up history discussion.</TEXT>

    <TEXT> gt; I think just random videos of Aikido or Kendo should be removed unless its posted as a visual aid for someone asking a question, In the 4 years I have modded this sub, there has never been a martial arts related post that wasn't a dude in Thailand in a wifebeater hitting a chair with a stamped Katana or some guy cutting bamboo or slicing a lemon, or "hot chick does a kata wearing something that definitely isn't a gi", and there has never been a question attached. Hopefully that will change going forward.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>It was created during the Edo period, after the wars were long finished, to give the bloated bureaucratic class who happened to carry swords a sense of purpose. Most importantly there is no formulated set of rules, it was a general philosophy that wasn't really established as much of anything until the Meiji period, and in particular after that in the 1930s.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I wanted to make an official post since this subreddit is partially run by staff from the Samurai Archives. This might only be interesting to a handful of people here, but the hosting company for the Samurai Archives website and Wiki is shutting down in December, so after about 21 years on the internet, I have decided to discontinue the website. The main site hasn't been updated in about 13 years, and still mostly contains HTML dating back to 1999, so I don't really see a point in finding a new host and shelling out a yearly fee for what has really become just an online archive for a very old website. Unfortunately the [Samurai Archives Japanese History Wiki](https://wiki.samurai-archives.com/) will also go down with the ship. The wiki went up in 2007 and currently has well over 7,000 Japanese history articles. I'm looking at creating a new wiki, although it will have to be done from scratch, so I don't really know what will happen with it. All that being said, the [Podcast](https://www.samuraipodcast.com/) and [Forum](https://www.tapatalk.com/groups/japanese_history/) will still be around. And who knows, maybe eventually a new website will develop. Anyway, thanks to all the supporters over the decades!</TEXT>

    <TEXT>A few thousand hits a day, a couple hundred bucks a year. The problem is the Wiki software, it was heavily modded and customized, so moving to a new SQL host would be a difficult task that would require database and coding expertise far beyond myself and my resources. Regardless, I wouldn't be giving anyone anything. Someone could have light administration privileges, but there's no way I'm transferring anything to anyone.</TEXT>
