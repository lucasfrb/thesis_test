    <TEXT>This episode had me REELING. It seriously made me incredibly anxious, as I cannot handle thoughts of mortality but that is beside the point. I have so many questions. Mainly about Bojack's dad. Why was he not there? Why was secretariat like a stand in for his dad? I mean it could be that Bojack considered secretariat more of a father figure then his own father but his mother was no motherly figure and she was there. It can't be that he never made amends with his father as he did with Beatrice because Herb was there, and he explicitly told Bojack that he did not forgive him. I heard somewhere that the dinner party was filled with people who's deaths affected Bojack, but then why was Crackerjack there? He died when Beatrice was a child, and his death never affected Bojack directly, unless you count Crackerjacks death impacting Beatrice and in turn Bojack. Also why was (I don't remember his name but the guy who died in the fire) there? Or the uh... lemon guy. Why had Bojack had the dream before? Was it a reference to past near death experiences? His personal fight with mortality? Why was the bird there and why was the tar dripping the whole time, also why did Bojack puke the tar if the tar represents death? Why did Sarah Lynn sing the same song Gina did?</TEXT>

    <TEXT>If Bojack had had the dream before then he was used to nearly drugging himself to death and then waking up. He was so used to his self destructive actions not having lethal consequences that he assumed they wouldn't, until he didn't wake up at the part he always did. Then he realized what was actually going on. I find it interesting that he goes on to ask Herb does anyone ever wake up, because he has before, its almost like once he went into the performance room he lost all of his power.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>It is interesting though because if the show did end there, that whole last episode, even with the title talks about the regret these dead characters have in regards to their suicide in secretariats case. It ends with Bojack panicking that he is going to die, and secretariat is nearly forced back into the door. Its the view from halfway down, and they are both entirely powerless, maybe if that had been the last episode it would have produced copycat syndrome, but it definitely did not frame suicide as a positive thing.</TEXT>

    <TITLE>I have had this condition and knee pain for 4 years now send help</TITLE>
    <DATE>2020-03-22 08:55:24</DATE>
    <TEXT>I am 14 years old and have had osgood schlatters for 4 years. I have been running and doing track and field for much longer then that and that is how the problem came about. Everywhere on the internet says it goes away it around 2 years on its own, or when you stop growing, however I have not grown at all since August 2019, around 7 months ago and I have noticed no difference in my pain. I am concerned, and really want this issue resolved before I start running for a high school track team as I am tired of this condition interfering with my running and causing me pain on a daily basis. Any ideas about why this condition has lasted so long for me or why I still have pain despite having stopped growing? What can I do to run track in high school without constant knee pain.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I think it was also so that people watching could more easily relate, and see themselves in bojack. If he was a human, then subconsciously our brains could go, oh I don't have black hair, or oh I'm not this etc. but with a horse, none of us are horses so we are identifying ourselves with his feelings and behavior and we can relate to him on an emotional level without any physical appearance based boundaries as we might have with Diane.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I have experienced the same thing. I've dealt with guilt for years for feeling responsible for my friends suicide attempts. But I have learned that you have to put your emotional health above the emotional health of others. You just do. If that makes me selfish then it makes me selfish. If that makes me a terrible person who is responsible for the suicide attempts of others then sure, but I am not a professional and I was really not capable of helping these friends especially at the time. It really hit me when Diane was saying how she felt after getting that voicemail from Bojack at the pool. When she made him promise that he would be okay if she moved across the country. That fear of needing to get away from someone but fearing they can't survive without you is so terrifying, and so real. It is not Diane's job to keep Bojack alive and I am so glad the show addressed this because it is a real problem. When I had severely suicidal friends who made me feel responsible for their lives I was 11 years old. It was emotionally damaging for other reasons but I remember I would come home and just cry because I honestly felt so scared all the time for feeling so responsible, and yet so powerless. Not a lot of people talk about this and I'm glad Bojack Horseman did because it is so important. Yes you should reach out for help. I'm not saying you shouldn't. I'm not saying that reaching out makes you a selfish person, or a burden. That's what makes this so complicated, because I never want to make people who are struggling feel worse about sharing their experiences, but one person should never be fully responsible for your health, life, and emotional well being. It is severally damaging and unstable for both people involved. Not only does it sometimes result in fear and overwhelming responsibility for the solo support system, but it leaves the person reaching out dependent on one person, which can be dangerous if that person needs a break, or has other responsibilities, or other friends. It's like Diane said when she moved out of Bojacks house. He was bad for her. He was bringing out the worst in her and she needed to get out of there and get her life back together. Lots of love to anyone struggling, I hope your pain eases soon.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>first of all, I apologize for my nail polish. Second of all, this scar is probably about a month old, and I had cut it with a few other  #8220;syro level #8221; cuts nearby. I remember specifically (TW) pinching the skin before cutting this one, and the skin split a lot like styro cuts do (TW over). I moved on with my life and the other cuts done at the same time with the same blade around as deep are all the same color of pink and even, although they #8217;re all keloids. This one is raised too, but the top of it is white and looks like a much more faded scar, while the other half is dark purple with darker red spots, darker then any other scar I have, even the ones where I cut deeper then this. Then even weirder, the side of the cut, like right next to it is discolored, and looks orange. I thought it was a shadow for the longest time but no, the skin is actually discolored. Does anyone know why this scar looks this way? Should I be concerned? and is it always going to look this way or will it eventually fade like the others?</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I #8217;m genuinely curious. I hate everything about myself. Every single bone in my body every single inch of my skin every word I mumble and every movement I make I loathe with everything I have. And it #8217;s torture. And I don #8217;t know how to deal with it because I fucking hate myself so much. I hate that I look like this. I hate that I got one fucking body and it looks like this. I hate how I #8217;ve ruined it with binge eating and self harm, I hate how I #8217;m too depressed to take care of it. I can #8217;t even distract myself. Every post on social media every scene of a T.V. show is just pictures and videos of girls who are prettier than me. Every hobby I have is just a reflection of what a failure I am. I don #8217;t know what to do anymore, I will never be good enough. Nothing I ever do will ever be good enough. I will always be this failure and this ugly disappointment</TEXT>

    <TITLE>I #8217;m irrationally terrified that my boyfriend committed suicide and I just don #8217;t know yet</TITLE>
    <DATE>2020-08-21 20:32:53</DATE>
    <TEXT>okay so this is going to sound really irrational and I know it is but ive been panicking about it for days. So I am 14, and my boyfriend is very depressed and suicidal. A little over a week ago he was texting me about being super unstable and I was trying to be supportive. I know he has a therapist and a good relationship with his mother so he has a support system. Anyway he flaked on some plans which is fine. Idk if the excuse he told was true or if he was just feeling too mentally ill which is totally fine. Then a few days later he texted me  #8220;I #8217;m going to miss your kitten, and you #8221; kind of out of nowhere and I found it really strange. At first I though shit is he going to break up with me or something, but he was going camping and so I though maybe he won #8217;t be able to talk to me for a while without service?? I didn #8217;t know. Anyway we kept texting once he left to go camping and be was joking about suicide and stuff which he does a lot. Then he didn #8217;t respond for 48 hours. We haven #8217;t gone more than a day without talking in months, never two days. its really unusual, he hasn #8217;t even read my messages. I can no longer see when he #8217;s been active on instagram and I know he is probably just somewhere without service or maybe his phone is broken but Ive had some trauma with people close to me and suicide before and I keep spiraling into what if hes dead what if hes in the hospital what if he killed himself and I keep having panic attacks and I #8217;m so fucking scared and idk what to do. I don #8217;t want to just casually text him hey are you in the hospital and did you try and kill yourself because I know I #8217;m probably wrong I #8217;m just so fucking anxious and so scared I just want to know that he is okay. Edit: he texted me and just had no service for 3 days camping</TEXT>

    <TEXT>heres something that really really helped me with health anxiety.  #8220;Fear doesn #8217;t stop death, it stops life #8221;. its kind of cheesy but I had really bad health anxiety and mine was avoidance based so I never wanted to go to the doctor. thinking about this helped. like I #8217;m not going to go to the doctor anyway and being scared that I #8217;m sick is not going to make me any less sick, it #8217;s just going to make the rest of my life miserable</TEXT>

    <TITLE>Being a perfectionist does not have "pros" and "cons"</TITLE>
    <DATE>2020-09-25 17:34:32</DATE>
    <TEXT>I've seen a lot of people try and argue this, how being a perfectionist has pros and cons and as someone who is an extreme perfectionist, I disagree. At the very least there is no argument to me over if being a perfectionist is a good thing or not. It's not just oh it has advantages and disadvantages because good grades and a work ethic isn't much for the price you pay. I can't do anything I love anymore. I can't get out of bed, I can't get dressed, I can't look in the mirror because it will never be good enough. Nothing I wear is ever good enough, my body is a failure, everything I say is wrong. I might have to quit the sports I used to love because every time I practice I break down crying because I'm not good enough. I procrastinate constantly because I have too many missing assignments and thinking about them makes me feel like a failure. I hate every single thing about myself, I hate every single thing that I do. My life is a miserable race and nothing I do no matter what is ever going to be good enough. It's never going to make me happy. I am a failure of a human being and I hate myself and I don't know how to be any different. That is a hefty price to pay for any "pros" that being a perfectionist gives you and it pisses me off when people try and argue that being a perfectionist is actually a good thing.</TEXT>
