    <TEXT>I have this issue too and it makes me INSANE as it triggers my ocd. No fucking joke, im close to deleting youtube from my phone because of this shit. But I think I found a solution (didnt test it yet, but sounds like it could work and hasnt been suggested before I guess). At [https://myaccount.google.com/language](https://myaccount.google.com/language) you can change your language and select other languages you can speak. Now the bad thing about this is to completely disable any translation you would have to select ALL languages. And there are a few hundred of them... So yeah, its not the perfect solution, but its a good solution just for the content you watch. However, videos that arent your language probably still will be translated... IT MAKES ME SO FUCKING INSANE WHY ON EARTH WOULD GOOGLE DO THIS SHIT</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Not really. Its not 100% free, its just a free version that has less functionality than premium. With premium you can connect to better servers and better connection and you can connect to more. With free youre limited to like 5 countries or so.

    <TEXT>Gotta be honest, neither is superior. Its all about preference. You might compare android phones to each other, but you can barely compare iphones to android phones (if you want to say which is better), because they use a completely different software, which is the main reason why you even get an iphone or android phone (obviously not counting those who just buy iphone for the brand). Although you can compare them in certain aspects, like camera, battery life, screen, speakers, processor etc. but iphones dont lack in that regard so I dont see the reason, why people start the discussion, that iphones are so inferior to android phones, in the first place</TEXT>

It all started 8 hours ago, when the bot posted the "spotify-cheese"-meme but didn't post the link in the comments of the mirrored posts. Now, the bot hasnt posted anything for 4 hours, although its supposed to post something every 20 minutes. R.I.P. in peace me_irl_bot  #128532;</TEXT>

    <TEXT>There is a difference between depression and being depressed. Depressed is the feeling and actually a symptom of depression. One can say they feel depressed without being diagnosed with depression. Just as I dont need to diagnose you that youre sad when youre sad, because youre well aware of it. And I think depression is one of the easier things to "diagnose" and when people tell me they are, my first reaction isnt "did you get diagnosed?". Yes, many people self-diagnose wrong and feel sad a few days and say they have depression. But when there is someone with maybe even suicide attempts, felt depressed for years already which you can see looking at that person then I dont need them do be clinically diagnosed to believe them and I would never judge them for saying they have depression without having been diagnosed.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>My Blackwidow Chroma V1 has some lighting issues. The 1 (Numpad) and the A key have issues. In Spectrum mode their colours are offset. They can light up in all colours (so I assume the RGB lights arent broken), but they show the wrong colour at the wrong time. Now whats even weirder is when I go into reactive mode (where a key lights up after being pressed) the A and 1 key dont light up at all. Instead a few keys around them light up but with different colours... Super weird. I recorded a video that shows the effect, at the beginning the keyboard is in Spectrum mode, then later I switched it to reactive mode and showed that all keys work fine (they light up green when pressed) besides 1 and A: http://imgur.com/a/nEf8vwM Can this be fixed with software? (As I assume its not a hardwareissue) Btw I dont have warranty anymore</TEXT>

    <TEXT>My problem with taking the quest tho is that ultimately I want an Index. Going Quest - gt; Index is really expensive and although with the Vive - gt; Index im still going to pay more than just Index, I at least have something to play with (im super impatient lol). Besides yeah, I will want knuckle Controllers, but at least the Vive Controllers give me the opportunity to play with the Index till I have the knuckle controllers. It just feels like going for Vive - gt; Index is least money wasted if I want an Index in the end anyway and im not patient enough to save up for it.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Thing is eventually I want the Index, but spending 1000 #8364; on it all at once is too expensive, especially considering its going to be my first headset. My thought process is, that with the Vive I can test if VR really is something for me and if it is I can upgrade to the Index without having to spend too much all at once as I've already got the base stations and controllers. If I were to get a Rift S, upgrading to the Index would only be possible by buying the whole kit and thats too much. Besides resolution, is there anything else about the Vive thats not good? I dont care so much about resolution, refresh rate is more important to me. And tracking. If the Vive is comfortable and has good tracking it just seems like the better choice to me.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Yes, im planning to get an RTX 30XX GPU. And yeah, im definitely waiting for the Quest announcement anyway. For me its kinda a question between the new Quest or a Vive and then Upgrade to the Index. And I know, the Vive is super outdated right now and not very good. However its kinda just like a Rift S but with a bit worse resolution but on the plus side I am getting 2 Base stations and 2 Controllers I can use with the Index. My thought process is that if I am going to upgrade to an Index anyway, the worse quality of the Vive compared to other headsets in a similar price range in exchange for 2 base stations and controllers is worth it. It gives me more flexibility.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Is it possible to control an App that doesnt support shortcuts? For example I have LSC lamps but the LSC app doesnt support shortcuts. My goal is to turn on the lights, whenever my alarm goes off in the morning. I was thinking about maybe recording my input in the app or something like that, but I am wondering if thats even possible. So yeah, is there a way to control apps, that dont support shortcuts, with shortcuts?</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Thanks, I will look into it. Interesting with Voice control though. If thats a thing, thats possible, where my iPhone would automatically detect any options in the LSC app, so I could control it with my voice, then where is the problem making my iPhone navigate through it automatically. I mean, this just proves the iPhones ability to at least recognize all available options in the app. Incorporating that in the shortcuts app would open like infinite possibilities.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>This has probably been asked a lot before, but I am getting super impatient. Estimated shipping date is between 21st - 28th, so somewhere between monday to the monday after.

If it goes to "preparing to ship", how fast can I expect it to deliver? My impatience is killing me ngl</TEXT>

I am also quite close to the netherlands (germany), I believe my AirPods and Pencil (they also came the first day of estimated delivery) came from Hong Kong or something, so knowing that my iPad might come from the Netherlands gives me hope. It just sucks that its saying "processing" and there isnt anymore info about it. Its like 3 days till first day of my window and the window is still one whole week. By now they really should be able to give us an accurate shipping date :/</TEXT>
