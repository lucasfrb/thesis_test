    <TEXT>Wouldn #8217;t call it brutal really (I think) I met this amazing woman one night while waiting for the bus home from work, she was drunk as anything and wanted me to go to subway with her so she didn #8217;t have to go alone. I went and we was laughing and joking, got her on the bus with me and walked her home. She gave me her number and said to call her at some point. We met up a couple times had a few drinks went dancing and built a good little friendship over about 2-3 weeks, we was both very flirty with each other and always making innuendos. So I thought fuck it lets ask her on a proper date, like wine and dine romantic walk kind of date. I give her a call and say that I like how we #8217;ve gotten on over the last couple weeks and asked her about the date. Her exact response  #8216;hahahaha no no no I don #8217;t have those kinds of feelings for you you were my last option for when my friends let me down for going out and doing something #8217; I literally had no words and since then I haven #8217;t heard from her or seen her at all....crushed lol</TEXT>

You #8217;re not a good person and are defo a creepy fuck. You were 21, an adult and had plenty of chances to say no and stop it. It #8217;s not like you were both drunk met in a club and she was saying she #8217;s old enough. You didn #8217;t stop it though. So yeah congrats.

    <TEXT>Why though, you say you justified it because she was the one making the moves, that makes it fucking worse tbh because as an adult you have the bigger responsibility of making morally correct choices. My advice, my honest advice is no one got hurt, she didn #8217;t get knocked up and it wasn #8217;t rape. You are obviously torturing yourself enough thinking about it. Just crack on with life, you #8217;re the one that has to live with what you did.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Why does everyone have such a problem with the things I #8217;m saying. Those of you who have done this and knew what you were doing, fucked a kid. I #8217;m English and the legal age is 16 does that mean I #8217;d fuck a 16 year old.....no. Just because it #8217;s the law doesn #8217;t make it right. Some laws the legal age is 14 does that mean you #8217;d fuck a 14 year old because you #8217;re legally able to do so ? If I #8217;m coming off too harsh I do apologise for that but ffs the amount of you justifying fucking basically children because it was a mistake and it was technically legal is fucking worrying EDIT: I love how people are still downvoting the fuck outta me because they don #8217;t like what I say but aren #8217;t talking to me about why they don #8217;t like what I say hahaha</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Well I think the word teen at the end of their age maybe has a factor, and like I said early some countries it #8217;s legal to fuck a 14 year old. I #8217;m almost 27 and the legal age in my country is 16. Could I fuck a 17 year old. Yes. Would I ? FUCK NO....no you don #8217;t use law as a measurement doesn #8217;t mean you can fuck a 15 year old because they #8217;re mature though.</TEXT>

Also I #8217;m not punishing him I #8217;m speaking bluntly, he #8217;s admitted to knowingly fucking a 16 year old not every person is gonna be like, you made a mistake and you #8217;re not a bad person.

    <TEXT>As promised my  #8216; #8217;Karen #8217; #8217; story hope you all enjoy and that there #8217;s not too many mistakes lol there is a TL:DR at bottom ................ So about 4 years ago I worked for a company called LIDL a German based cheap supermarket that also had a brother company called ALDI (REMEMBER THIS) I was a till monkey hadn #8217;t been there long so was on till for 8-12 hours a day and nothing really else other than putting stock back that had been left at the tills. I catch on pretty quick with new jobs and situations and one day (Sunday) which is busy for supermarkets in Blighty as people think that they #8217;re gonna run out of food within 24 hours I had a queue backing up, no worries I do what I can without rushing the customers too much, I can #8217;t help but notice a head popping out of the line every now and then and looking straight at me, now if you #8217;ve worked retail especially a till monkey you #8217;ll understand when I say you get pretty good pretty quickly at noticing people,stuff and things without even looking. I must #8217;ve looked for a fifth of a second but she was a fucking PRIME EXAMPLE of a Karen, literally had the shitty hairdo with coloured streaks in it, yoga pants on and huffing and puffing so fucking loudly you would #8217;ve thought she was trying to get into one of the little pigs houses. She gets to me and before she #8217;s even out the item on the register I know that the fuck is going on.....BANG  #8216;whenever I but electricals from you guys it always breaks and I #8217;m always having to return it #8217;......(me looking her deadass in the eyes and don #8217;t even reply)  #8216;well aren #8217;t you going to say anything, get your FUCKING manager here NOWWWWW #8217;  #8216;look darling if you #8217;re gonna talk to me like that you can leave and come back another time #8217;  #8216;REEEEEEEEEEEE (basically) How FUCKI..... #8217;  #8216;swear at me again, I can take you the exit where you can come back another day once you #8217;ve calmed down, or you can calm down now and we can get to the bottom of your issue #8217; (don #8217;t forget I already know what #8217;s going on) people are obviously fucking starting to pay attention now cus even when she #8217;s trying not to she #8217;s still kicking a fuss, she takes a deep breath and says very slowly (cus I #8217;m a r....e...t....ard) whenever I buy electricals from here I always have to return them may I please (that hurt her) speak to a manager about a refund and compensation) I smile at her.....not a normal smile but like the fucking Grinch ear to ear and the calmly reply to her  #8216;if you take it back to ALDI where you brought it from I #8217;m sure they will be willing to help #8217; FUCK MEEEEEE I #8217;ve never seen someone go so red before....ummmm im not sure how to finish this so yeah that #8217;s my  #8216; #8217;Karen #8217; #8217; story TL:DR Stupid cunt brought back a faulty to the wrong store but the story is so worth a read rather than the TL:DR</TEXT>

    <TEXT>So about 4 years ago I worked for a company called LIDL a German based cheap supermarket that also had a brother company called ALDI (REMEMBER THIS) I was a till monkey hadn #8217;t been there long so was on till for 8-12 hours a day and nothing really else other than putting stock back that had been left at the tills. I catch on pretty quick with new jobs and situations and one day (Sunday) which is busy for supermarkets in Blighty as people think that they #8217;re gonna run out of food within 24 hours I had a queue backing up, no worries I do what I can without rushing the customers too much, I can #8217;t help but notice a head popping out of the line every now and then and looking straight at me, now if you #8217;ve worked retail especially a till monkey you #8217;ll understand when I say you get pretty good pretty quickly at noticing people,stuff and things without even looking. I must #8217;ve looked for a fifth of a second but she was a fucking PRIME EXAMPLE of a Karen, literally had the shitty hairdo with coloured streaks in it, yoga pants on and huffing and puffing so fucking loudly you would #8217;ve thought she was trying to get into one of the little pigs houses. She gets to me and before she #8217;s even out the item on the register I know that the fuck is going on.....BANG  #8216;whenever I but electricals from you guys it always breaks and I #8217;m always having to return it #8217;......(me looking her deadass in the eyes and don #8217;t even reply)  #8216;well aren #8217;t you going to say anything, get your FUCKING manager here NOWWWWW #8217;  #8216;look darling if you #8217;re gonna talk to me like that you can leave and come back another time #8217;  #8216;REEEEEEEEEEEE (basically) How FUCKI..... #8217;  #8216;swear at me again, I can take you the exit where you can come back another day once you #8217;ve calmed down, or you can calm down now and we can get to the bottom of your issue #8217; (don #8217;t forget I already know what #8217;s going on) people are obviously fucking starting to pay attention now cus even when she #8217;s trying not to she #8217;s still kicking a fuss, she takes a deep breath and says very slowly (cus I #8217;m a r....e...t....ard) whenever I buy electricals from here I always have to return them may I please (that hurt her) speak to a manager about a refund and compensation) I smile at her.....not a normal smile but like the fucking Grinch ear to ear and the calmly reply to her  #8216;if you take it back to ALDI where you brought it from I #8217;m sure they will be willing to help #8217; FUCK MEEEEEE I #8217;ve never seen someone go so red before....ummmm I #8217;m not sure how to finish this so yeah that my  #8216; #8217;Karen #8217; #8217; story TL:DR Stupid cunt brought back a faulty item to the wrong store</TEXT>

It has its problems for sure but the game itself is amazing albeit even if the side quests are a tad to much fetch and return although the fan service is great during them</TEXT>

    <TEXT>What's that got to do with smelling children Trump is fucking awful I'm not denying that in any way shape or form, but Biden isn't right dude it wasn't even like once the amount of photos and videos of him being weird around kids is too many to just say he's a man who's softened due to losing one of his own</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Where the fuck did I call him a pedo or even suggest that, all I said is he's weird around kids. If someone smelled my kids I wouldn't assume Pedo but I would assume not exactly right. You're getting super angry over me not liking Biden even though I don't like Trump either. Your shit is weak and I forgot why I don't comment or more stuff, thankyou for reminding me.</TEXT>
