    <TEXT>Its undeniable that many such situations are bad, but animals like chickens for example, while they do have a brain and feel pain, they don't really care where they are because the only thing on their mind is eat sleep cluck repeat. Working on a free range chicken farm was surprising, because most of the chickens didn't leave the barn when the gates opened.

By the time you're 20 you should have the qualifications to get a full time job. But you have to remember that you're not going to get your dream job or even a job in an area you like.

Now i am unable to attend any real social gathering and have no way to make friends that i know of. I can't drive, I can't go anywhere 18+ (pubs etc.), I can't make friends at work and I don't go to school. On top of this I have no preexisting friends in my new town. What should I do?</TEXT>

    <TEXT>and vice versa. soon to be fathers should need the mother's permission not to get an abortion A child is the legal responsibility of both their parents, so the decision to have one should be made by both the parents Sure the woman is carrying the child, but it's legally both the parent's responsibility. It is irresponsible not to because even if the father is unaware he is a father he can and will be forced to pay child support for the next 15+ years. Don't even try saying he accepted the risks when he chose to have sex, because having a baby is a huge responsibility and should not be decided based on one person's decision. Furthermore, if the mother chooses to go against the father's will, they should forfeit their right to claim child support.</TEXT>

    <DATE>2019-07-31 12:16:36</DATE>
    <TEXT>Myth describes dragons as large, typically four legged fire breathing monsters. But, if a creature of such a design were to exist, It would either have to have a wingspan hundreds of times it's own bodylength, or become tiny. I put it to you, that if dragons were to exist to the same design as your average dragon, they would be comparable in size to the humming bird, typically hunting small insects and using fire only as a last resort in self defense. Go forth with your updated, biologically possible dragon in mind, and think "wow, dragons would be a pretty cool pet"</TEXT>

    <TEXT>The human brain is wired for addiction, even for things you wouldn't consider addictive. For example, when you go to the toilet, you suddenly need to go to the toilet more than you did when you realised you need to go to the toilet. The same works for masturbation. I'm sure that all of us decide to masturbate more in our bedrooms or shower than we do in the living room. To combat this, I assigned specific actions to specific locations. Bedroom for reading and sleeping, bathroom for cleaning etc. I did the same for other locations around the house. (The key to nofap is making no note of the absence of it, but rather the presence of other things) Not only does doing this combat addiction, it also matures your brain, and causes it to value routine. Next time you experience to urge to do anything, make note where you were at the time. I assure you this will be a location where you are most likely to experience that specific urge. Good luck bros</TEXT>

    <DATE>2019-09-24 13:30:36</DATE>
    <TEXT>If you're ready for a long, emotional, personal off topic post this one's for you.  #8203; So it's no secret that NoFap changes the way you think, but for me it has given me insight far beyond what I thought I could reach. I've been studying psychology in my off time, which I'm sure contributed somewhat to this epiphany, but I maintain that it was mostly my journey in NoFap. For reference, I'm 17 years old and I've only just started acting like I'm older than 14, and I'm learning that it's true; Ignorance is bliss For a long time I was emotionally barren. Psychologically I choc this down to my parents, who split up soon after I was born, which until recently I thought were useless. But upon examination of they way they were raised, they did remarkably well. My father's father was very absent, he was a geologist who spent most of his time travelling, rarely visiting the wife and kids. My grandmother as a result became an emotional wreck. Leaving my dad with no decent parental influence. But enough backstory. I'm assuming, from my memories of childhood that my father tried his best to offset the damage his parents had caused by being emotionally available. He tried very hard, but failed. The specific memory that provoked this chain of events happened when I was about 4. Dad was intent on kissing us and tucking us in when we went to sleep each night, but he had horribly scratchy stubble which made me ask him to stop. (I really meant to ask him to shave) A decade and a half passed and I realized that there have been many instances when my father tried to do the things he wanted to do with his father with my sister and I, but every thing he tried I rejected. I can't imagine how dad felt at this, but it's essentially prompted me to mend my emotional ties to my dad. TLDR: NoFap mended my relationship with my father Thanks to anyone who read this, and also good luck. It means a lot to me that anyone took 5 minutes out of their time to hear my story.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>To truly be successful at nofap, you need to become less resistant to it, and to do this you need to lower your general resistance. Don't feel like going to the gym when you know you should? Resistance. Don't feel like reading when you should be? Resistance. Don't feel like meditating? Resistance. To be successful at nofap, you need to lower your resistance to every other activity as well. That means you have to go to the gym when you don't want to, read when you don't want to, meditate etc. etc. Anything that you know you should be doing but don't feel like doing, do it anyway, because that's the only way you can lower your resistance to good habits</TEXT>

    <TEXT>So the basis to the idea is that people are sorted into groups of 100, and those 100 people are treated legally as one person, but they all have jobs and the earnings for those jobs are pooled into one and averaged among each member of a community. This I believe would create very strong ties within communities, and would give access to jobs more readily, as employers would be more likely to give jobs to members of their community, as it would give them a bonus as well This would also give communities an opportunity to specialize in one area, because if a doctor is hiring people from their community, eventually the entire community becomes doctors</TEXT>

    <TITLE>Due to my complete inability to do art, I'm going to describe to you my favourite race</TITLE>
    <DATE>2019-11-18 10:17:52</DATE>
    <TEXT>I haven't named them yet, and I will probably continue to leave them nameless until I finish their conlang, so I can name them in their own language. My race resembles large mantises, typically black, brown or dark green in colour, with 4 large hind legs attached to the bottom of their chest and 2 humanoid arms capable of fine manipulation. They have 2 large spider like eyes, capable of seeing visible light along with some of the ultraviolet and infrared spectrum. In terms of clothing they usually opt for coloured loincloth, although those in positions of status sometimes opt for more extravagant attire. My species is a sub-hive mind. They unquestioningly share the ideology of their queen, but are free to make their own choices and have their own emotions and ideas. Most interestingly, my race has 2 separate languages, which they use for different purposes. The first is a kind of loud, whistled language, which is typically used to share knowledge, ideas and facts. They can raise their voice in this language deafeningly, so it can be heard for kilometers around them. The second is a language of emotion. It is used in quiet conversation with people that they know and trust, and is sometimes used in conjugation with their first language in order to help convey meaning. It is uncommon for this conjugation of language to be used in conversation with strangers or acquaintances, but is customary when speaking to the queen or other nobles. It is most often used on its own in situations of intimacy or vulnerability. This language is spoken in low clicks and trills that are impossible for a human to replicate. edit: forgot to add combat. When in combat, this species wears no armour, instead relying on their speed and agility. They typically fight with a spear or a weapon which requires speed to be used effectively. Archers are uncommon, because it is considered cowardly to use one, but occasionally they will steal bows from the other race that inhabits my world to assist them in certain situations. This race values courage in battle, as their front is well protected, but their abdomen is vulnerable</TEXT>

    <TITLE>Went through a creating spree today. Unfortunately I'm a terrible artist, so I'll describe to you my favourite creations of today</TITLE>
    <DATE>2019-11-24 11:45:09</DATE>
    <TEXT>I call it Crimson Grass. Through a magical accident which I won't go into, a creature was created that was animate, but possessed the power to photosynthesise. From it a new group of creatures evolved. The main body of this creature is almond shaped and contains a rudimentary brain and a heart. It grows 2 types of roots, many small strands to collect and transport nutrients and water to the body, and some large paddle shaped roots with which it pulls itself into the ground. Once the paddle shaped roots are level with the main body, they begin to grow upwards and develop chlorophyll. Once they reach the surface they begin to photosynthesise. When the grass is attacked, it emits a high pitch squealing noise to warn it's neighbours, then it and its neighbours retract their leaves into the ground by contracting the muscles along the underside of the leaves. This is a slow process, and usually involves the top of the leaves being eaten, resulting in blood loss. This is where they get their name. Crimson Grass reproduce through their small roots, seeking out their neighbours roots. When they reach a neighbouring root, they fuse, then grow a shoot up through the earth containing seeds. Once it reaches the surface it pops open, spreading seeds as far as possible. A decendant of crimson grass are the Ents. They deserve a different name, because their only similarity to Tolkien's Ents are that they resemble trees. Unfortunately I couldn't think of a better name. The part of the ent that protrudes from the ground resembles a short Boab tree, to keep a low center of balance when moving, and also to contain nutrients and organs. The submerged roots sprawl far beneath the tree. They take up as much space as possible around and under the tree, in order to outcompete the flora of the land. The second type of roots are small and fast growing. They move parallel to the ground seeking out the most nutrient rich earth. Once the earth has been drained of its available nutrients, the Ent detaches the majority of it's large roots, leaving only enough to walk with, and detaches all its small roots. It then travels in the direction that its small roots detected the best soil. Occasionally an Ent will bloom and should it be pollinated, it produces a tuber that eventually grows to become a young Ent. Of course the higher order creatures that inhabit my world recognise Ents as weeds, or perhaps pests, its hard to say. They attempt to remove any Ents they find. They are unfriendly towards flora, leaving great masses of roots behind that prevent trees and shrubs from growing there, whilst simultaneously draining the soil of nutrients and taking them to be deposited elsewhere. This results in patches of bare dirt where an Ent once stood, on which nothing can grow. Thanks for reading</TEXT>

    <TITLE>Magic in West Dunia and the Mage Lords</TITLE>
    <DATE>2019-11-25 08:25:19</DATE>
    <TEXT>All magicians in West Dunia are descended from The First Mage, called Amaziah. He and his wife, Adea had 6 children. The first child which we will focus on was called Reth. He lived a peaceful life with his wife Nea, content with living his life without using his power malevolently. They had 3 children, Zuberi, Kando, and Niagh. Kando was lost as a child, and was not found. Legend claims that he crossed the mountains to the east, and fought a great battle with the eastern natives, at the age of just 9 After his father's death, Zuberi observed his cousins children and recognized that their power was far less than his fathers and grandfathers. Determined to pass on the full extent of his power, he channeled it to swaying the minds of the people. It was not long before he became King, and with his authority, he decreed that his sister was to be his own. They became the first of the Mage Lords, and after them 3 generations of incest passed, until the corrupted king Sefu was overthrown by the people, and his children murdered. Thus ended the line of the Mage Lords The other descendants of Amaziah were not so concerned with their waning power, instead becoming skilled craftsmen, monks, and warriors Amaziah's youngest son, Shomari, studied with the monks and became a celibate, although this didn't stop him from creating life. He spent much of his life creating and animating paint and stone. he became a skilled artist and stonemason. He gave his works his knowledge and philosophies, even carving a perfect copy of himself in stone, complete with his own memory and personality. Many of his works survived thousands of years. His own statue advises the king and teaches philosophy 3000 years after his death. There's more to come I'm sure but this is about as far as I got today. Thanks for reading</TEXT>

    <TITLE>In regard to benefit lists and depreciative posts [Meta]</TITLE>
    <DATE>2019-11-30 09:16:38</DATE>
    <TEXT>We're on a dangerous boundary because we only understand what works, not what is biological and what is a placebo. If we constantly idolize full NoFap and list benefits and whatnot, it sets an unreachable goal, but once reached all the perceived benefits manifest themselves. Whether this is from a placebo effect or not I can't say, but it is clear to me that people with low streaks feel daunted by this goal, and are thus less likely to achieve it, regardless of the placebo effect once achieved. On the flip side, depreciative posts, that being posts that claim coomers are foggy, dumb, anxious, you name it, will not motivate people. It will actually make it harder to quit. This is because people with very low streaks are bombarded with posts saying that when you relapse you become a worse version of yourself, impacting their self image and resulting in a positive feedback loop of relapse, feel bad, small streak, relapse, feel slightly worse, streak and so on. Motivational posts such as these, while they seem positive in the moment, when looked into become extremely negative. In the struggle to quit, NoFap actually has a negative effect on people with low streaks, because they become less of what they were when they started because they're constantly reminded of what they aren't. Einstein said "If you judge a fish on it's ability to climb a tree, it will live it's whole life believing it's stupid" People with low streaks are barely able to drag themselves out of the water onto land, so this constant comparison drains motivation like nothing else. In conclusion, I believe that all posts regarding any benefits of NoFap, and any consequences of relapse are overall negative towards the progression and rehabilitation of people with particularly low streaks. Hope I made sense. I'm not the best at getting my point across.</TEXT>

    <DATE>2019-12-04 01:14:28</DATE>
    <TEXT>Edit: ~~mental illness~~ social deprivation Primates generally masturbate in times of boredom or social isolation. It's a symptom of failure to be a part of society. There are exceptions, but humans aren't one of them. The biggest example of masturbation as symptoms of mental illness is in Genie, the victim of the forbidden experiment. She was deprived of almost all social interaction until the age of about 14. She was a chronic masturbator, and it took years of therapy to get her to stop. This is the most extreme case, but it likely applies to everyone on this subreddit. Something went wrong in your lives, and masturbation is a symptom of that. The only way to challenge your addiction is to remove the cause of your addiction, and it won't be easy. I suggest that most of those reading this check out r/nosurf, r/StopGaming, r/GetSuave and other improvement subreddits</TEXT>

Greatness of soul will be lost, which cant stand out unless it disdains as petty what the mob regards as most desirable" - Seneca, Moral Letters What we consider harmless indulgences can easily become full blown addictions. We start with coffee in the morning, and soon enough we cant start the day without it. We check our email because it's part of our job, and soon enough we feel the phantom buzz of our phone every few seconds. Soon enough, these harmless habits are running our lives. The little compulsions and drives we have not only chip away at our freedom and sovereignty, they cloud our clarity. We think we're in control-but are we really? as one addict put it, addiction is when we've "lost the freedom to abstain." let us reclaim that freedom.</TEXT>

    <TITLE>The push for socialism in first world countries is based solely on young people thinking they have the right to luxuries</TITLE>
    <DATE>2020-02-13 07:17:01</DATE>
    <TEXT>Here in Australia I'd say about 98% of people under 25 have never experienced true poverty. Ive had young people tell me they've gone days without food, except they have all this star spangled technology to make their life more interesting. It's even worse when there are jobs aplenty, but they don't want those jobs, they want a job they enjoy. I try to tell them I say, you don't have the right to enjoy your job. About 5% of people in Australia are unemployed, yet somehow people under 25 who won't work a shitty job think they're entitled to compensation. Saying capitalism is bad for poor people. Once I knew a meth head, let's call him James. He wasn't on social security, he was cut off for not looking for a job. He still managed to pay his rent, afford food, and buy meth. What he did was trade meth for broken electronics, fix the electronics, then sell the electronics back to the druggos he bought them from. Talk about Capitalist innovation. Living on the dole is even easier. It's the easiest way to live, and yet there's still a push for higher social security wages and it pisses me off</TEXT>

    <TEXT>What the fuck did you just fucking say about me, you little bitch? I'll have you know I graduated top of my class in the Navy Seals, and I've been involved in numerous secret raids on Al-Quaeda, and I have over 300 confirmed kills. I am trained in gorilla warfare and I'm the top sniper in the entire US armed forces. You are nothing to me but just another target. I will wipe you the fuck out with precision the likes of which has never been seen before on this Earth, mark my fucking words. You think you can get away with saying that shit to me over the Internet? Think again, fucker. As we speak I am contacting my secret network of spies across the USA and your IP is being traced right now so you better prepare for the storm, maggot. The storm that wipes out the pathetic little thing you call your life. You're fucking dead, kid. I can be anywhere, anytime, and I can kill you in over seven hundred ways, and that's just with my bare hands. Not only am I extensively trained in unarmed combat, but I have access to the entire arsenal of the United States Marine Corps and I will use it to its full extent to wipe your miserable ass off the face of the continent, you little shit. If only you could have known what unholy retribution your little "clever" comment was about to bring down upon you, maybe you would have held your fucking tongue. But you couldn't, you didn't, and now you're paying the price, you goddamn idiot. I will shit fury all over you and you will drown in it. You're fucking dead, kiddo.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I recently read a book which had a tip on eye contact that I've found gives very positive results. They called it sticky eyes. Basically you keep looking at people for a second or 2 after you or they finish talking. You come across as more trustworthy for some reason. Also it only works well in a group setting, or when you have something else you should be looking at. I have no idea how to hold eye contact in a 1 on 1 setting. Another technique they described they called epoxy eyes, and it's for when you want someone to feel special. It also only works in a group setting. Basically you make eye contact with someone after someone else finishes talking. It makes it seem as though you're interested in their reaction to what was said, and people like it</TEXT>

This must be an assumption based on the fact that other strains of coronavirus can be worsened by having asthma Edit: "So far, there has been little information on people with asthma with COVID-19. There has been at least one publication suggesting no effect of COVID-19 on asthma.1 But, it is important to note that there are several other coronaviruses that normally circulate and cause cold/flu like symptoms. These viruses have been shown to cause asthma episodes or attacks. So, whether COVID-19 can cause asthma episodes or attacks remains to be seen." https://community.aafa.org/blog/coronavirus-2019-ncov-flu-what-people-with-asthma-need-to-know</TEXT>

I've noticed a similar feeling as when I was PMOing daily. I think about it more often now that its more readily available. It's very distracting. When I was on PMO I always had it at the back of my mind, a constant thought, because it was always available, and now the same's happening wity sex. I don't think it's a particularly healthy phenomenon, and I don't know if I should tell my gf that I can't do it as often as she'd like</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I think it would be really cool if they could collaborate so the player could play them all in one playthrough, with like an elder scroll or daedric lord that transports them back in time to be able to do the Morrowind or Oblivion questlines. I don't think it would be particularly difficult to do, and it would be awesome.

I've been looking into dog psychology for a while, and in the case of the average, not abused dog, they're actually quite manipulative. Specifically in the case of my sister's dog, she's learned to act almost human, so human that she can extort stuff from my sister by triggering an emotional response. I believe the "unconditional love" shown to us by dogs is a combination of manipulative behaviour and the desire for reassurance, rather than a symptom of Stockholm syndrome</TEXT>

    <DATE>2020-04-30 00:00:12</DATE>
    <TEXT>So, round year 7 (age 13 or so) I could fit in a locker and had done so on multiple occasions. I was in a class that had a few of my friends lockers in it, and the bell went for lunch, so I decided I was gonna scare my friends by jumping out of a locker. I climbed inside the locker and asked someone to close it, they closed it, grabbed an unlocked padlock and locked it on the locker. Now I didn't know what was going on, I thought they might have put a padlock on it, but not locked it, but nope, the dipshits locked me into a locker with a lock they didnt know who owned. It turned out the owner of said lock wasnt at school that day, so I was locked in a locker for bout 30 minutes before they decided to get the master key Vice principal shows up, takes me and the locker locker to his office. We both get 3 weeks in school suspension because they want to "discourage it from happening again" 3 weeks of suspension because some dumb shit decides to lock me in a locker</TEXT>

    <TITLE>Ideas for a crime side-quest for a modified DnD game?</TITLE>
    <DATE>2020-05-15 09:02:23</DATE>
    <TEXT>My players are getting bored of combat, and I wanted to spice things up in the RP sector. Basic theme is a town that's basically being run by brigands, who are holding an alliance with the campaigns main villains. They run the local mine, and provide the antagonists with weapons in exchange for money and the promise of influential power. The original quest was a bit lame and combat heavy, so I'm changing it up. Most of the townspeople are being kept quiet through blackmail, and the rest through bribery. Any ideas or criticisms?</TEXT>

    <TITLE>Had an idea for a cross between communism and capitalism. I call it communal capitalism</TITLE>
    <DATE>2020-05-16 03:32:35</DATE>
    <TEXT>The basis of the idea is that people live in communities of 100, give or take a few, and within that community, each individuals income is pooled and equally divided among the community. Individuals can choose to marry outside their community, and in doing so either move to their spouses community, or both move to a new community. Individuals can choose to move to a new community without marriage, but they don't get to choose which one, and get transferred to a middle class community Outside the communities, capitalism functions as normal  #8203; I think this would help equalize income, so poor people can transfer to middle class communities, but also promote a healthy amount of nepotism, as hiring people within your community provides you with more available income  #8203; Any criticisms or questions?</TEXT>

    <TEXT>These ideas exist because they're persistent with nature. Humans are just animals, and sure we've grown beyond our natural instincts, but you cant deny, nature is sexist. Take Chimps for example, our closest relative. It's not uncommon to find a lone male chimp, but it is to find a lone female chimp. Realistically for primitive humans, being alone for a man was dangerous, but being alone for a woman meant death. Consider also the fact that historically, women were the ones that stayed home and looked after the children, and men went out to get food. This has always been the way until the 20th century, which is evident through ancient texts and archaeology. Quite probably women have always lived longer than men, because women never had to fend for themselves. How's that for sexist?
