    <TEXT>I remember when I first started watching Highrollers. I had just started my second year of University and events of the previous year meant I was struggling. I fell back into watching the Yogscast and saw that Kim was in a regular stream, so I caught up. And it was incredible. I fell in love with all of you, I fell in love with all the characters, I fell in love with Dnd. I'm in Japan now, so timezones mean I won't be able to watch live, but I wish you all the best, though I know it will be great. Thank you Mark for allowing us fans into this amazing world you have created. :)</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I went to Japan earlier this year. I was struggling mentally on my own, a nervous wreck and it was the first time I'd gone away without my parents. It was a study abroad trip to learn to teach English. At the beginning of the trip I could barely speak in front of people and have them hear me, the thought of teaching a class made me feel sick. By the end of my trip, I had taught part of 2 classes (surprising the teacher because he could hear me at the back of the classroom), played guitar on stage and even sung at karaoke. I had become more confident and my teacher was worried it would disappear when I went back home. When I came home I got a lot of bad news. My Grandad had been diagnosed with cancer while I was in Japan and nearly died on the operating table to remove it. Some of the baby rabbits born just after I left had passed away (I had seen pictures and was excited to meet them) and one of my dogs had a stroke. My mental health started getting worse again and my confidence went. Then I did the unthinkable, I went to the doctors. For the first time in the 6-8 years I had been suffering I told my Doctor I needed help. I started on medication to help sort out my anxiety and depression and began counseling to sort through the bullying in my past. I'm the last few weeks it has got a lot worse. I'm finding it harder to control certain thoughts but I have the support I needed all those years ago. I told my flatmates about it and they have reacted with nothing but kindness, and I've told my Mum, something I thought I would never do. Japan was the beginning of a journey I never thought I'd have the strength to take, and it's been hard but amazing at the same time. Sum up: Went to Japan which started the journey of sorting out my mental health problems I had been struggling with by myself for 4-8 years.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Not mine, found it through HAT films: Two prawns were swiming around the sea one day, the first one was called Justin and the second was called Christian. They were continually being chased and threatened by a shark that inhabited the area. Eventually Justin had had enough so he said to Christian "I'm fed up with being a prawn, I wish I was a shark, then I wouldn't have to worry about being eaten all the time." As he said this a large mysterious cod appeared and said "Your wish is granted" and, believe it or not, but with that Justin turned into a fearsome shark. Christian was horrified and so immediately swam away as he was scared of being eaten by his old friend. As time went by Justin found his new life as a shark to be boring and lonely, none of his old friends would let him near them as they thought he would eat them and so they just swam away whenever he approached. It took a while but eventually Justin realized that his new menacing appearance was the cause of his sad plight. Then one day he was swimming all alone as usual when he saw the mysterious Cod again, he thought it'd be better if he could go back to his old life and so he swam towards the cod and beg to be changed back. The cod worked its cody magic and suddenly Justin was a prawn once more. With tears of joy streaming down his cheeks Justin swam straight to Christians home as he opened the coral gate the happy memories came flooding back he banged on the door and shouted "Christian it's me, Justin, your old friend come out and see me again!" Christian replied "No way! You're shark now and you'll just eat me, I'm not being tricked into being your dinner" Justin shouted back "No I'm not a shark anymore that was the old me, I've changed, I found Cod I'm prawn again Christian!" #65279;</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I relate to this a lot, not feeling like I deserve to get better, that I'm just faking it and its all for attention. I spoke to the mental health advisor at my uni and they said a few things. 1) Everyone deserves to get better. People wouldn't help you if they didn't feel that you needed help. The people who are helping are doing it because they love you, your brain just doesn't want to believe that. 2) You may not have been diagnosed but it doesn't mean you are not suffering from a mental health problem. For some reason, people believe that in order for how we feel to be true we need a label. If you are struggling you deserve help, whether you have a diagnosis or not. 3)You may think that everyone at your age goes through this but that doesn't mean you don't deserve help. Everyone handles life in different ways, some of us turn to self-harm, others to drink whereas some people can cope in safe ways. There's no normal way to cope with things. When I'm feeling bad I hurt myself, when my Dad's feels angry he punches doors, when my flatmate feels bad she dances or sometimes hurts herself. It's our way of coping. 4) Some parents find the idea of self-harm difficult to discuss. I emailed my mum to let her know 2 months ago and we haven't spoken about it once. Its distressing but its a lot to deal with, finding out your child hurts themselves. Its difficult getting help, its become such a comfort for us. But you do deserve getting help. Even if you believe you're doing it for attention it doesn't make it any less important. You deserve to get better, everyone does, your brain just doesn't want you too. (sorry, reading back it seems like a lot of rambles, but there's a group of people here who are willing to help if you need it, and I'm sure there are people around you who will too.)</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I have already given the perfect gift. I gave it early because the person it was for was not expected to last until Christmas. It was for my Grandad, I changed my last name to my Grans maiden name and his last name, to carry on their names and make him proud. I showed him the deed poll confirming it on Monday 17th December, after I came home from University and found out how bad he had got in the few weeks since I last saw him. His reaction made it all worth it, he was so proud and he was so happy. That was one of the last proper conversations I had with him, after that he went downhill quickly like he was waiting for me to come home so he could to tell me in person. Sadly he passed away at 2:30 am Christmas eve, but that will always be the best gift I have ever and will ever give. R.I.P Grandad, love you more than I could ever put into word.</TEXT>

    <TITLE>Nintendo switch- I can now finish games!!</TITLE>
    <DATE>2019-01-01 03:56:33</DATE>
    <TEXT>(Sorry, long post) I've always struggled with completing games, I get frustrated with myself while playing and end up putting it down and never picking it up again. The first game I ever completed was Luigies mansion 3 years ago, I had been playing it for as long as I can remember. I've played Mario games, Zelda games, Pok #233;mon games and never completed any until the Nintendo Switch. I brought it with Breath of the Wild, which I completed, and then got Mario Odessy, which I also completed. Christmas day I got Pok #233;mon let's go pikachu (because you can catch growlith in the wild and I love growlith.) I started playing it straight away, and though I've been busy since Christmas I've put in just under 30 hours and have finished the story line. I remember playing fire red when I was younger, getting frustrated and putting it down to find my brother had deleted my data. I now have this childish joy that I've finished a Pok #233;mon game for the first time! I still have 50 Pok #233;mon left to catch, which I am so excited to do. To some of you it may not seem like much, but to me this is an incredible start to 2019.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I ended up cycling to school because I was heavily bullied on the bus. One day, as I was cycling past the group that bullied me, one of them shouted that they were going to kill me. Of course, when I got to school I told the people who were meant to deal with bullying and they told me to 'toughen up' and that there won't be able to harm me anywhere on school ground. 2 weeks later some of the group was caught on CCTV passing a knife around. It was then that I stopped telling people if something bad had happened, I would keep it to myself and punish myself because I thought it was my fault if anything bad happened around me. It was only a few months a go I went and got the help I need, but even when my grandad passed Christmas Eve from cancer I managed to convince myself that it was my fault. Seriously fuck the school I went too.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Well I have four dogs so prepare for a long reply. They are all greyhounds, 3 ex-racers and one who didn't want to race: Maisie- she didn't want to race. When we got her she was nervous, we had to carry her outside to go to the loo. Now, 8 years later she's enjoying her puppy years. She comes up to you for cuddles, dives under my legs when I sit on the floor and throws her stuffed toy around the sitting room. She's a sweetheart, and it's always funny to watch her dive under her bed Sophie: she is the complete opposite of Maisie, she loves attention and her tale is always wagging . When she wants to come in she'll rub under her chin and her neck on the door. When she comes up to you for cuddles, she'll do what I can only describe as foot stamping (she goes from foot to foot) which is adorable to watch. Fanta: she loves cuddles and playing with her teddy bear. If I sit on my seat she will try to climb up on me, she has punched me in the groin before. After she's eaten she rubs her snout on the ground. She is also playful, and randomly runs around the house. Rocket: he's an old boy and has lost most of his teeth. He has an overbite and eyes my mum fell in love with. He loves boob ear scratches (where he will rest his head between someone's boobs and get them to scratch his ears.) Though he's old, he has moments where he jumps around and barks for either sausages (a treat we give them) or to go out. He also has a tendency to pee on his front leg and the first the we walked him he kicked shit all over me.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>So, in on Christmas day 2015, the last Christmas with my Gran, she got me some Rookie retro quad skates and a set of protective gear. I have been obsessed with the idea of rollerskating for as long as I can remember, but I've had constant problems with my ears which affected my balance. My balance has improved greatly, I can finally balance on one foot. But, I can't seem to get the hang of skating. It terrifies me. I gear up, put on my skates and as soon as I stand up I freeze. The only way I've been able to move is on the carpet, but I really want to skate outside. Last time I tried a stood there in tears because I just wanted to move but couldn't bring myself too. Has anyone else experienced this? What's the best way to overcome this fear? I know that I'm bound to fall at some point and that it won't hurt too much with all the gear, but honestly, it terrifies me. Sorry, this is a long post, any advice would be greatly appreciated.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Thank you, everyone, I discovered the carpet in the conservatory is thin with tile underneath, so it's not as easy as carpet but not as difficult as outside. So, I've decided to begin on that. I've been slowly moving on that, practising falling and getting used to my feet moving on wheels. I'm going to have a look for a rink near me, maybe ask my mum to come with me (she skated a lot when she was younger.) Thank you all for your advice, I'm going to take it slow and try not to overthink it.</TEXT>

    <TITLE>Question about heels</TITLE>
    <DATE>2020-01-11 22:08:54</DATE>
    <TEXT>So, I see a lot of skates with high heels like the moxis and that lot. However, my skates don't have as high as a heel, there more like speed skate, and I constantly feel like I'm falling backwards. I can't afford new skates so I'm wondering if putting aa heel rise in the boot would make it easier or if it would make no difference at all. I hope it makes sense.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>My biggest regret is not being there with my cat when she had to be put down. I had just started university, was about 30 minutes away from home, but my parents didn't tell me until they came up to visit, (she was put down on the Monday, they visited on the Wednesday.) I'm not angry that they didn't tell me, but she was put down with my dad in the room (who she hated and I don't honestly blame her for) and when he visited on Wednesday he complained that he had to pay an extra  #163;20 for an injection to calm her down. So, I've told my mum that if anything happens to one of my dogs and they need to put down, I wanna be there. We had a scare last year with my oldest dog (who turned 14 today) got heatstroke, (he overworked himself at a vet appointment.) I carried him into the vet (quite difficult as he's a greyhound) and stroked him as they administered liquids and tried to cool him down. Luckily he was fine, but when I wasn't with him dealing with it was a lot harder.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I'm so sorry, it is the worst. I knew she didnt have long left as she was losing weight and had a growth on her cheek (my dad refused to get it check, I dont honestly got on well with him for many reasons.) But the first main pet I lost was a retired brindle greyhound called peter. One morning before school he was sick and wasnt interested in going for a walk, so i told my mum to take him to the vet. He had a tumour on his stomach, and though they performed an operation he didnt make it through the night. I'm a bit further away from my pets at the moment, but I'm back home at the end of the month. I'm the one who takes them to the vets (they are a lot calmer when I'm with them, especially the youngest one who suffers from anxiety.) I do make sure to talk to them over the phone, but I am scared of losing them. But sadly they dont live as long as us, but as long as we give them the best life we can, that's all that matters.</TEXT>

His breathing was laboured, and he was chugging water (he had been unable to keep anything down for 2-3 days prior.) Firefighters came, then ambulance, a 45 minute journey was shortened to 15 and the doctors where working on him before he even got out the ambulance. He was diagnosed with type 1 diabetes, his blood sugars where the highest the doctor had seen caused by some medicine recommended by a doctor that he saw the day before. The doctor said he was lucky to be alive. That shit was scary, though his sugars are relatively under control he's a teenager now so he doesn't always check them when he should, luckily it has not been that serious since.</TEXT>

Outside I just freeze up, constantly feel like I'm going to fall backwards and then get annoyed at myself cause I just want to skate. Like today, thought I'd try near a wall so I can hold on for balance, stood up for like 5 minutes and just couldn't move. It sucks....</TEXT>

    <TITLE>My brother(19) stole my(22) sex toys. Rant</TITLE>
    <DATE>2020-05-18 16:38:21</DATE>
    <TEXT>To say I am angry is an understatement. For as long as I can remember my brother has stolen stuff from the family, money from mum, food and drink from the fridge without asking. Hes stolen medals from me and my original pokemon cards. Well, I discovered my sex toys were missing, went in his room and found one. Then found the rest of them (he only took 3/5, the other two obviously went interesting to him because they were all in the same box.) So, today I ripped his room apart to find my stuff, first my sex toys and then the medals he stole and the pokemon cards. I am angry. I told no one about the toys because they are private. But I had to tell my mum so she can help me look. Mentally, I was not in a place to tell her about them, I'm not ashamed of them per say but I like to have some secrets that are healthy. I cant lock my room because the cat likes to sleep on my bed, if i buy a lock box hell steal that and break it open (we used to keep chocolate bars in one in the fridge and one day it mysteriously broke.) Hes stolen from me for so long and nothing has been done about it, he gets away with it all the time. So know i have to clean and disinfect them, lord knows if i will ever be able to use them again because i dont have positive memory with them now. I'm going to have to store them differently (he threw away the packaging which I used for storage.) I'm angry, I'm really angry. I dont know if i can handle even looking at him when he comes home, cause I want to knock his teeth out. Edit: he used one of them and its ruined because he didnt clean it. Also used all the lube (it was nearly full and now it's pretty much empty. Told mum hes got to transfer the money to me so I can get a new one and she doesnt seem bothered at all. Edit 2: I have ordered an indoor camera for my room (cant look the door because the cat likes to sleep in my room and needs constant access.) I am setting up an old phone as a security cam for now, but I'm going to catch him doing it then probably get authorities involved. Last update: hes paying me back for the toys he stole and the lube he used. I have an old phone set up as a CCTV camera and a proper one coming in the mail. Mums shouted at me cause I brought it up and she cant kick him out cause theres "nowhere he can go." The last two days have felt like a year, my mental health has worsened considerably and I have felt like I'm going to be sick constantly. I'm going to look into getting my own place (with a trusted friend) but that's probably not going to happen for a while. Life just sucks right now.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>For as long as I can remember my brother has been a thief. He's stolen everything, money, music discs, electronics, everything. Well, today he went too far, I won't go into details here but let's just say its disgusting. If you go into my reddit history you'll see what I mean (NSFW if you do.) What can I do? I've set up an old phone in my room as a camera until the one I've ordered arrives. I can't add a lock on the door because the cat likes to sleep in my room and needs easy access. I'm at the end of my tether, he's 19 and still thinks it's okay. Nothing is working. It doesn't feel serious enough to call the police, I don't want to waste their time but it might turn to that. But is there anything else I can do, I'm in UK btw, if that helps Edit, just to say my parents know. My Dad does not know the details of today's discovery, but Mum does.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>My Grandad passing away/ after he passed. My gran passed away from cancer in 2016 just before I started university and it was the first time my grandad had lived alone because she was his first and only love. When I started university I stayed with him during the holidays so that I could get university work done and help him with anything he needed help with, mostly gardening. I went to japan on 2017, my second year of university, for a study abroad trip and came back to discover that he had had an operation to remove his penis because it became cancerous. He had been struggling for a while and it was horrible to hear him suffer. We hoped that would be the end of it, as you can probably guess it wasnt. Christmas holidays 2018, my last year of undergraduate. I knew my grandad was getting I'll again, he had some more appointments and had a few more bad days, but I generally thought it was just part of recovery. I had started to get help with my mental health after my trip to japan so came back on the monday instead of the friday so I could have an appointment with the mental health advisor. My mum picked me up, everything seemed fine. We chatted in the car, told some jokes. I remember saying that I hope it wont be like last time I was back, where a growth my grandad had burst and he spent the night in hospital. She didn't say anything and I didnt think much of it at the time. I got back and there was a note on the front door, I didnt read it at the time as I was excited to see my grandad and the dogs. Came into the house and the dogs got excited, like they always did when I came back. I sat on the floor and made a fuss of them, my grandad was upstairs but I thought he might just be on the loo, or having a shower. My mum came in and said to come upstairs. So i did. He was laying in bed though i had seen him about a month earlier he looked a lot worst. He looked exhausted and told me that it wasnt good, that he wouldn't be around for much longer. A few days later, 2am christmas eve I went upstairs to go to bed. I stay up late with the dogs, kick them out so that they dont wake my mum up to early so I regularly go up after midnight. This might was no different, I knew we had a busy day ahead of us as christmas is always a big event so sorted a few things out before I went up. I walked upstairs and heard a gurgling noise, it was my grandad who had not been asleep for a couple of days now. I woke mum up, she called Macmillan and her brother and we knew it wouldn't be long before he went. He passed away just after 4am. The gurgling was because he couldn't swallow and had a build up saliva. He passed away holding my mums hand and in his other nad was a picture of my gran. I went up when mum came down to tell us (I couldn't stay upstairs because I was getting really stressed) i went up and saw him. He looked like he was asleep, its only because he wasnt snoring that I knew that he wasnt. Hes body was taken away in the morning, and we took his dogs upstairs because they kept waiting for him to come downstairs (the dogs dont go upstairs) and their reaction was heartbreaking. They ran into his room and looked around, even looking at the bed for him. They started whining, before settling down on his quilt (which became their bed, long story.) We got ready for christmas and had what was both the best and the worst Christmas. Death in general is difficult. I am really lucky to have some incredible memories with my grandad, but everytime I think of those memories I cant help but think of him laying in that bed, looking so helpless just wishing I could do something. Another one is when my younger brother almost died, but that's a long story and this comments long enough.....</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Give him a place to hide, or that's just his place and try not to disturb him there. We have a greyhound who was incredibly nervous when we got her, wouldn't even go outside by herself. A year or so later she was running around and playing, but didnt like people sitting on the floor, now (about 5 or so years later) shell bark because she wants me to sit on the floor for cuddles. It's a lot of work, but it is worth it. I wish you all the luck hes so adorable.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>So, I have half a bottle of lube that I cannot use (long story, but even looking at it makes me want to be sick.) How can I get rid of the contents? Is it as simple as throwing it down the sink, or should I just throw the whole bottle in the bin (not ideal, as I want to recycle it) Its water based lubricant if that helps. Thank you</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I'm sorry for you lost, theres nothing that can be said to make it better. But, part of the dissertation I'm currently writing involves losing someone to suicide, and in my reasearch I've learnt that there are so many resources for help. Look for local groups for people who have lost someone close to them to suicide, I am sure there are subreddits offering support. Dont try to fight it alone, talk about it and how you feel. Mourn him, remember the happier times with him. I dont have any links on hand as I am on mobile, but when I go on my laptop I can add some links. Again, I am sorry for your lost. But you are not alone. There is help out there.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Maisie is a 10 years old rescued greyhound. She never wanted to race so my grandparents adopted her at a young age in around 2012. When they first got her, she was nervous. Would not come out of the corner. My grandparents had to carry her outside to go to the loo. A year after they got her, she started going up to my gran for strokes and playing, throwing a tennis ball around and tearing up the lawn. After my gran passed in 2016, she started barking until I sat on the floor so she could dive under my legs. She never used to like people on the floor. She still has nervous moments, does not like strangers in the house, walking sticks or other dogs approaching her while we are out for a walk. We have 2 other greyhounds and all 3 of them are mischievous as anything. We dont bother buying dog beds because she dives under them and throws them around destroying them in just a few weeks, so we use old quilts which they all love if not more than dog beds. She still plays a lot, has started playing with soft toys (though squeakers scare her.) She was deemed un-adoptable and I'm glad my grandparents took a chance with her. We cannot believe how much her face has changed. It was only because I was looking through some old photos and took a double take.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>NTA But I'll tell you from experience, be prepared for backlash. I changed my last name from my fathers last name, to my grans maiden name and the name she took when she married my grandad. I changed it as I did not feel like part of my dads family, never really got on with them or my dad. I changed it in 2018, was going to announce it on christmas as a gift to my grandad (who was more of a father to me,) sadly he didnt make it till christmas but I told him beforehand and he was over the moon. My dad however, was livid, along with my aunts, uncles and cousins on his side. I'm female, I have two brothers who can take on the name. In the end, it is your name. You have dealt with bullying because of it, you have to live with the name for the rest of your life. In my opinion you choose your name. Your not shaming your family history, your just changing your last name and there is nothing long with that</TEXT>

    <TITLE>I am fed up with having to deal with my brother when I no longer feel safe in my family house (Rant)</TITLE>
    <DATE>2020-09-15 12:40:22</DATE>
    <TEXT>My brother (19m) is a thief, and a liar, and all around an arsehole. You might remember me from 3 months ago when I posted that he stole and used my sex toys. Well, he paid me back, I have a CCTV camera in my room now, but nothing else has been done. I am on edge all the time. My mental health has taken a downfall, if I forget to put my camera on I feel sick. At night, I'm scared hes going to come into my room and do god knows what. I don't feel safe. But I'm the one having to accommodate for him. I'm the one whose meant to forgive and forget what he did. He has been brought a new laptop that cost  #163;1,7000 (that's hes meant to pay back monthly but I know hes not going to), mums constantly bragging about what's happening at work because everyone apparently loves him there. And I am getting so frustrated. He doesnt pay rent, he doesnt help around the house. I feel guilty for not paying rent (parents came up with a deal that I wouldn't have to pay until I've finished education and work full time, I finished this month and currently job hunting) and I feel guilty if I spend time in my room during the day. I stay up late at night so that the dogs dont wake mum up to early, and feel guilty if I have to go to bed early. I am at the end of my tether and there is nothing I can do. I'm expected to just forgive that he violated my privacy. But the fact is, I cant even see an advert for sex toys without feeling sick, cant even hear about sex without feeling like I'm going to vomit. I am working so hard to improve myself and hes getting away with doing nothing. No one is listening to me when I say I dont feel safe, all my mum says is that it wont happen again. But it will, I know it will. Hes been stealing off his family for as long as I can remeber and he is never going to stop. Sorry for any mistakes and if it doesnt make sense, honestly just wanted to vent because no one else is listening.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I know, it came from the fact that I am normally awake longer so it wasnt a problem.I used to live in this house with my grandad before he passed, and he was an early riser were as I found it easier to do work at night. At the minute, we are getting our house rewired so I'm having to get up earlier which is messing it all up. I'm slowly working through this task I've set myself, but because I'm the only other female I've always been the one to help out where as my two brothers dont. I did today spend most the day upstairs, something that normally makes me feel bad, and I've just gone "fuck it, I need to day where it's just me." Regarding moving out, a friend and I have agreed were going to get a place together (they dont have a great home life either) but covids knocked the plan back. I'm trying to sort out a lock for my door, but that's unlikely to happen.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Gizmo is our second black cat. Our first was Sooty. I got her when I was in primary school, we were taking my youngest brother to pre-school as i was off sick. His preschool was less than a 10 minute walk from our house, and because I was too young to be left alone I was taken with her. On our way there, a parent (whose child was also at preschool) was followed by this small black kitten that was meowing. The parent was annoyed, and told my mum that she was just going to dump her. My mum was horrified and offered to take the kitten of her hands. This is the true story, we tell another story to my dad but that's a long story. When we got back, she settled on my lap and did not move, even when the window was open. We got on like a house on fire, she spent every night asleep on my bed, would sit on my lap every morning before school. The last photo I have of her is just before I left for uni where she had stretched herself over my lap. She was put to sleep in my first year of university,. Gizmo was given to us by a friend of my uncle while in second school. She was tiny, used to get under the cabinets and go behind the dishwasher. We were meant to take her to the local cats protection but we fell in love with her. Shes meant to be my brothers cat, but she spends most her time in my room as his doors always closed and mine is open. In the future, when we get another cat after gizmo has gone were probably going to get a black cat. They are so stigmatised and our local shelter has loads (we have dogs so not currently in a position to get another cat.) Sorry, long reply  #128514; hope it makes sense</TEXT>

    <TEXT>1st- person was going to dump a black kitten and told my mum while dropping my brother off at pre-school. We took her in with the plan to take her to our closest cat shelter, but I ended up falling in love with her so we kept her. That was in 2006, she was put to sleep in 2016. 2nd- uncle calls us asking if we can take a black kitten overnight, her owner is allergic to her. We take her in, again to take to the local shelter and we just kept her. Shes 7 now, loves sleeping on my bed and has moved house with us. Long story short, dont leave kittens/cats with us to take to the shelter, we keep them.</TEXT>
