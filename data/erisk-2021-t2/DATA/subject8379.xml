    <TEXT>https://youtu.be/hA4iKSeijZI This shows it pretty clearly. Obviously you can't have graphic deaths on youtube as that's against their terms of service. The closest thing to this that has happened in my country is 'Bloody Sunday' in Northern Ireland. It is widely talked about and we try to learn from it as a nation. Even then, no western nation has done anything near to the scale of killing that China did here, and if we did we wouldn't cover it up and not admit our mistakes like China does all the time. Even if every nation did this you shouldn't defend your own government doing it.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I think you're kinda missing the point of the article. Once the lockdown is over people will flock out to socialise again. However, people are realising that commuting to work every day to have meetings that could be done over the internet and pretending to look busy for 3 hours of the 8 you "work" every day is a waste of everyone's lives, and doesn't help companies either. By doing some of your work at home there would be less pollution and money spent on fuel, and people would have more free time to actually enjoy life, whilst companies have the exact same productivity as before. I call that a win-win. As well as this, the pandemic has pushed universal basic income into the mainstream eye. It helps to alleviate poverty, and makes the economy stronger as people are less anxious about spending money but still want to work to increase their wealth as UBI is that, basic. After this there's going to be a lot of debate about how we run society, as a lot of our lives before this pandemic were harmful, both to our own lives and the world around us.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>To input a bit of hope into the conversation, a crisis caused by this lockdown as well as environmental benefits that are evident from it may be the push that we need for real societal change. Let's be real, if the world continued business as usual nothing would change. People would continue to excessively consume, commute to work, etc until we fell off the proverbial cliff in regard to climate change. A widespread shift in societal attitudes from COVID-19 may be the thing that sets in motion changes that allow us to overcome a lot of the environmental challenges that you listed, and at the very least it's put hope into the public consciousness regarding them.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>This is why wind and other renewables, and nuclear power are in the west's interests in regards to energy independence. Fossil fuels (and solar because of rare earth metal mining being concentrated in China) are too uncertain to be reliable for energy independence. Wind power with nuclear providing baseload for the grid would give us security as the components for them and nuclear fuel are produced in western nations. Transport is a bit of a sticking point here, as electrification isn't going to be a quick task.</TEXT>

This is 100% China's fault, but the US isn't going to be able to hold China to account if it neglects its international standing like this and hands over influence in organisations like the WHO.

    <TEXT>But this isn't supporting the CCP, why do you keep saying that? Pointing out how the west should improve its international actions whilst a crisis is underway so that it can better hold China to account is the exact opposite of what the CCP wants. A strong democracy relies on evaluating your government's actions, and the existence of a strong and fair US is very much against China's ideal world. After this is all said and done it'll be too late, those who stand to benefit from the chaos, aka China, will already have done and people will say that it's too late. The Chinese are likely to use this crisis to strengthen their leverage in companies and organisations worldwide, the west needs to counter them in real time and not leave it until after the damage is done. And yes my account is quite new, now that universities are closed I have a lot more free time to argue and shitpost haha.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Inaccurate comparison. Thimerosal is used as a chemical preservative and disinfectant OUTSIDE the body. When used in vaccines it prevents microbial growth in the solution before injection, but once it enters the body it is diluted to the point that it is inactive. In order to cure an infection inside the body different methods are needed to broad spectrum chemical disinfectants. The concentration that a chemical disinfectant needs to be in to destroy microbes would indiscriminately kill all internal human cells it contacted. When trump asked his team if you could possibly use disinfectants that "work in a minute" by "injection" to "clean the lungs" he knew damn well that he was referring surface disinfectants, because medicine inside the body wouldn't "work in a minute" without killing the host. The look on his team's faces when he was asking them showed that they also think he's a fucking idiot. Your blind loyalty to trump is blinding you to the fact that the POTUS was speaking on the same level as a child who didn't understand why you can't drink the bleach in the bathroom to help your sore throat. Everyone enabling this madness is leading the US and by extention the entire western world off a cliff face. Recongnising a senile idiot isn't hatred, not wanting to remove him and defend your country is hatred to your fellow man.</TEXT>

Mail in voting works and is one of the main ways to vots in most other developed countries and fraud isn't committed because they don't use easily hackable electronic counters. The republicans claim that mail-in voting rigs elections, even though the US has been using vulnerable electronic voting booths, to distract from the fact that they don't want mail-in voting to drive up voter participation. Republicans have been gerrymandering and suppressing voter turnout for decades, they're a party of crooks.</TEXT>

The scale of the atrocities listed here however doesn't compare with the current industrial ethnic/cultural cleansing and oppression that China is inflicting on its non-han chinese citizens. It's like comparing America's school shootings to the the Rwandan genocide. On top of this, if you posted a Chinese equivalent of this on the Chinese internet it would be scrubbed almost immediately and the police would show up at your door to take you away for 're-education'. The very fact that you are able to post this on an american website shows that comparing the US to China is nonsensical.</TEXT>

Psychedelics can reliably and powerfully put into you a new appreciation of the present moment, but often you can slip back into your post-trip mindset quite quickly. Whilst it works slower, meditation can make this a part of your daily routine instead fleetingly after a trip. I am convinced that when I meditated heavily in the past it helped me to re-sensitise my brain to dopamine as I regularly turned off from the rush of modern life. It brought back my appreciation for the everyday world around me, and for this reason I wholeheartedly believe that everybody in modern society would benefit from practising it.</TEXT>

The push back against hydroxycholoquine isn't a conspiracy, it's the fact that there are so many unknown dangers with it such as an unknown rate of heart problems in people taking it for covid. Hospitals shouldn't prescribe any drugs that haven't gone through a proper clinical trial process to access these dangers and if it's even effective in the first place, it's unprofessional, unscientific and quite frankly reckless. This applies to hydroxycholoquine, remdesivir and any other drug for covid as it's a very new disease which we don't entirely understand yet.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>There's a massive crisis that's affecting everyone's lives, and the PM is spending all of his time and effort trying to protect an unelected bureaucrat who broke the rules that he imposed on the rest of us. I feel like this is a reasonable response from the media, this is a big deal. (Also I hate that 'the media' have become some kind of boogeyman term that people have started using.

    <TEXT>SS: This article talks about India's 'One Sun One World One Grid' (OSOWOG) plan. This can seen as a potential competitor to China's 'Belt and Road Initiative' (BRI), at least in the area of power generation infrastructure. As China's BRI has drawn criticism from environmentalists as it often finances carbon-intensive projects, the OSOWOG plan could serve as an environmentally friendly alternative that would promote investment into infrastructure whilst still allowing countries to uphold the Paris Agreement. With China's BRI and the US-led 'Blue-dot network' already existing as competitors however, it may struggle to attract bids from developing nations. Do you guys think that this will be a major competitor to those two initiatives, or is India too late to the game for it to make any major impact?</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I'm not a 'dem', I don't identify with a political party lol. I think you're fundamentally misunderstanding what's going on here. We're not blaming the virus itself on Trump, we're blaming the mishandling of the crisis on him and his administration. The US and South Korea had their first cases at about the same time, the US now has over 100000 confirmed deaths whereas SK has less than 300. There is no reason for this other than gross mishandling of the crisis by the US government. Trump was literally at rallies calling this shit a democrat hoax whilst SK was busy being proactive. Honestly though? If that doesn't at least get you to think then nothing will, to you politics and this virus just seems to be a team sport with no real-world consequences. To me it isn't, because of governments fucking this all up I actually know people that have died of coronavirus. And for that reason I hope Biden wins by a landslide and Trump ends up in prison for treason. His administration's incompetence has killed more americans than the war in vietnam. Have fun just blindly following everything the government says without question.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Either of two things. First, it would be a lag in reporting due to the VE day bank holiday, meaning that the increase is due to the figures catching up with the real death toll. Or, people have stopped obeying the lockdown and now we're going into a second peak. Excess deaths seem to be a much more reliable indicator of pandemic deaths up to that point than the official count either way. This second option wouldn't surprise me on the slightest.

    <TEXT>America has a truly shocking mental healthcare system compared to the rest of the developed world because of the for-profit healthcare system. Voting for Biden isn't likely to fix it as he isn't left wing enough to create a socialised healthcare service like lots of Europe has, but Trump actively makes it worse by removing safeguards against healthcare corporations screwing people. The republican party platform is deregulation at all costs, his administration's removal of environmental protections for the sake of profits is an example of this. In a country with a functioning mental healthcare system this woman would get help, the republican party is fundamentally against any system that doesn't put profit over the health of people like her. Vote for Trump, kids.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Pretty sure Starmer supports a lot of Labour's policies that were present in the 2019 manifesto, like increasing investment in clean energy and completely overhauling the universal credit system. He and his shadow cabinet aren't quite as left-wing as Corbyn was so I can imagine that some of the more radical ideas from the manifesto will be scrapped and redrawn as he becomes more established as leader. So far a government lead by him looks like it'd be a hell of a lot more rational than the one we have at the moment.</TEXT>

If they didn't know that they had been purged then they would have no reason to believe that they were not registered, for the last election I was still registered from the one before it. Now if a load of people from student and minority communities, which were the ones that seem to have been preferentially purged, show up to vote and then can't then that could shift the results of an entire election.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Basically there has been a boundary reshuffle that has been long overdue in order to make constituencies more fair. However, incompetency in the government has caused 9 million people to be purged from the voting roles during this. This is an issue as those purged from the roles may not be aware that they have and assume that they don't need to re-register come the next election, potentially leaving millions unable to vote as they didn't know that they were unregistered.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Mate calm your tits. This isn't about bullying minorities into voting, its the fact that millions who were already registered have been purged from the roles without their knowledge, meaning that millions who want to vote may not be able to next time as they would think that they were already registered from the last election, and so may not check until it is too late. This lack of oversight, either inadvertently or not you can't be certain, massively benefits the conservatives as those purged largely seem to be from student and minority populations. It's not about forcing people to vote unwillingly, it's ensuring that everyone that wants to vote is able to in order to maintain the fairness of voting. A healthy democracy relies on the fact that everyone who wants to vote is able to without obstruction.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>That's irrelevant. A lot of people may only check if they have a reason to believe that they've been purged since they last registered and then miss out, not everyone out of 9 million will check before the next election. It isn't an issue if everyone is aware of these changes, but I guarantee they won't be. It'll undoubtedly cause people who thought they are able to vote to miss out, and in my eyes that's a failure.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Gonna have to disagree with you here. Many people will see these voting registration campaigns and think "I already registered last time there's no need to check" because they hadn't seen this news. This could be through no fault of their own, they may just lead extremely busy lives and not keep 100% up to date with politics. I'm hoping that voting registration campaigns let everyone know that they may have been purged and that it really is only people that can't be arsed miss out, but in reality this will definitely rob some people of their vote.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>And even though the current conservative government has been trying to gut it for years the NHS is still one of the best healthcare systems in the world. We get healthcare on par with the quality that america gets, but in the end have to pay much less per person as its purpose is people's health and not profit. The NHS needs massively reformed, but its a far cry from being as broken as american healthcare.</TEXT>

The current government is frothing at the mouth at the opportunity to privatise the NHS and so have been systematically gutting its services in an effort to justify selling off parts of it to private companies. You're right about germany, it's what an idealised version of our health service would look like.</TEXT>

Trump was a well known associate of epstein's, and admitted he knew that epstein liked "girls on the younger side".

    <TEXT>I honestly don't know how people can still believe the stuff about 'the swamp' and how he's an outsider. He may have been a businessman instead of a career politician, but he's as much a part of the swamp that he claims to fight as any other DC corporatist. I mean him and his administration basically just looted the treasury to hand out hundreds of billions to wall street with no oversight in the coronavirus bailout. Do not make the mistake and think he cares about anyone other than himself and his rich friends. You don't "have to love and support trump" at all, trump is controlled opposition to the status quo to make people believe that they're fighting the power when they're actually voting against their own interests.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>In the UK there were more than 2 major parties competing for a majority until very recently, increasing voter apathy sped up the decline to the 2-party system like in the US. I got the histories mixed up but the point still stands, less voting means faster decline. FPTP is inherently flawed, but if everyone in the country voted instead of a politically active minority then the options would be more representative regardless. Reform is needed though you are right, but the only way to have a shred of a chance of that happening is to get EVERYONE involved with politics, and start by voting a literal fascist out.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>In this context Trump literally is one of them though? He was a close friend of Epstein and knew of/likely participated in his sex ring, hence the quote from Trump himself: "I #8217;ve known Jeff for fifteen years. Terrific guy. He #8217;s a lot of fun to be with. It is even said that he likes beautiful women as much as I do, and many of them are on the younger side." Your belief that Trump is fighting some battle against the establishment, when he's as much a part of the globalist/wall street elite as the rest of them, is distracting you from the fact that he has very likely raped kids.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Dude all we want is for the mods to do something about the constant propaganda/low quality posts from blatant Trump PR accounts. I'm not even from the US so I don't care much for either party obviously, but the constant reposting of stuff about biden/the dnc being satanists who killed seth rich and shit every single day without fail from the same accounts is stifling organic discussion in this subreddit and turning it to shit. Mods shouldn't allow their subs to be taken over by shill farms.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>You can get a reusable, washable fabric one for a couple of quid if you know where to look, and can just not stuff it in your pocket. Even crude fabric coverings have been shown to offer at least some protection to you and to others if you're an asymptomatic spreader, there's really no downsides other than feeling a bit uncomfortable if you're not used to it. I have to wear them at work for 8 hours a shift so people can wear them for 20 minutes whilst shopping.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Fair enough, I can't do anything to convince you at this point if that's your view. Just try not to fall into the trap that this only affects the 'weak and pathetic', although young people do not tend to die from COVID-19 a sizeable minority of those 'recovered' suffer long term effects like shortness of breath and chronic fatigue due to reasons that we're only just starting to understand (see the 'long haulers' on /r/COVID19positive). A face mask is a mild inconvenience compared to even the possibility of having covid aftereffects for months or even years on end. How is an incomplete covering worse than none at all by the way?</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I'd argue that the real conspiracy is that the tories keep paying all of this lip service but leave the rules intentionally vague so that nobody follows them, and then when things inevitably go tits up they can blame the public for the government's minimal effort. The same thing happened with pubs, all of the 'rules' put in place are not legally enforceable by police. They're still going for herd-immunity but want to blame the public for the deaths along the way.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I was referring to the 'hedonistic treadmill' where you hover around a baseline on average no matter your situation (barring depression/mania etc). However you are right, upon starting university and moving away fron home I did have a noticable increase in motivation that lasted for years. I attributed this to the more stimulating environment away from home. I think I was a bit vague about the 'discipline' bit. I believe that through personal discipline you can form motivation into a habitual behaviour, but something that you don't necessarily have to rely on to get things done.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>The first time I ever combined ketamine, weed and nitrous on the offset of an mdma experience I seemed to be stuck in a loop. Every second I could see my friend get up of of the sofa and then snap back and do it again for about 15 seconds, but i could still look around like I was in theatre mode in a halo game. Ever since then I have had strange thought loops on weed. Haven't had full on time loops on just weed though, more like a strange deja vu type feeling that makes me feel like I'd just experienced that moment.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Your partner is right, if you have any symptoms that you suspect may be covid but aren't sure then you should book a test and self-isolate until you are sure that you dont have it, doing otherwise would be extremely irresponsible. Your boss would probably agree that this is the right course of action if you told him you had covid-like symptoms, if he gets annoyed then he is in the wrong. If you book one of the early morning slots it is possible to get the results the same day so it wouldnt be a long wait. My case back in april started off as a slight scratchy throat and a groggy feeling before it developed into a bad fever later in the week. It's better safe than sorry, especially with the number if vunerable people you could come into contact with on public transport.</TEXT>

In terms of self care, make sure that you get plenty of rest and keep hydrated! You'll be fine soon if you do have it. What I also think helped me was vitamin d supplements i got off of amazon, as there is a statistically significant correlation between vitamin d deficiency and how severe your symptoms feel.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>There's so many coincidences because often there has to be for the system to be stable. See jupiter's moons for instance; ganymede, europa and io share a ratio of 4:2:1 in their orbital periods, they're in a 'resonance'. This weird coincidence is a kind of survivorship bias. The reason that their orbits have remained stable for this long is because bodies with similar masses in an orbital resonance with each other like this stabilise each other's orbits.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>It's a little more complicated than this. As the moon's orbit is elliptical it can vary in angular size quite a bit in the night sky, look up 'annular solar eclipses' for an example of this. Total solar eclipses happen when the moon is either the same size or bigger than the sun in the sky. It is often quite a bit bigger as well, as total eclipses can happen for several minutes at a time, and the moon's orbital speed means that it moves half a degree compared to the rest of the sky every hour. The '400' coincidence is in part an approximation of whats really going on. Still weirdly close though I'll give you that, but a coincidence in my opinion.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I've seen this before and I have mixed feelings about it. I personally believe that a lot of these are cases of synchronicity, there's so many different parameters to describe celestial bodies that there are bound to be a lot of coincidences like with the sun-earth-moon circumference thing. Some of those point can also just be picked apart because they can be explained. The moon's orbit is almost spherical and we only see one side of it, both because of the gravitational interaction with the earth's oceans. Over billions of years the moon tugged on the earth's oceans at varying degrees in each orbit, but the oceans also attracted back. This interaction circularised its orbit, and also sapped energy from its rotation, 'tidally locking' one side to earth. The largest impact craters being concave is quite a difficult one to explain, but it boils down to the fact that when a large impacter hits something at celestial speeds, the surface can be treated as a liquid during the impact, creating a [complex impact crater](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/a/a5/Complex_Impact_Crater_Formation.png) with a central peak. The mascons thing though?? Very interesting topic and I don't personally know why they're there, but they likely came from an atypical formation compared to every other body in the solar system. The prevailing theory is that it was formed from another planet impacting earth, but that has also been called into question.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I just find it ironic that the right wingers most paranoid about voter fraud from the left are the ones pulling this shit. Once again, everything the Q cultists accuse others of is projection. It should be obvious now that the entire 'movement' is a psyop.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>The meta-data says that the emails were created 4 months AFTER they were dropped off at the shop, now why would that be unless they were faked for the purpose of propaganda?</TEXT>

    <TEXT>SS: The metadata in the supposedly leaked Hunter Biden emails say that they were created 4 months after the laptop was dropped off at the repair shop. The emails also appear to have been created in 2019, compared to the date that Rudy gave (2015). This suggests that this entire expos #233; is a fabrication being pushed as pro-government propaganda, and makes the swarm of recent submissions on this subreddit about it look very much like an organised shill campaign to sway the US election dishonestly.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>SS: The warranty expiry date for Hunter Biden's laptop hard drive appears to imply that it was manufactured 6 days after it was supposedly dropped off at the repair shop. This inconsistency seems to indicate that we're not being told the truth regarding this expos #233;, lending at least some credit to the idea that the emails are a fabricated smear campaign intended to unfairly benefit the incumbent government in the upcoming US election. Some content may well be factual, but if this is not Hunter's hard drive then the data must have been compiled and put on to the hard drive by a third party. This means that the actual facts and fabrications that may have been added in to benefit the current government may be impossible to distinguish between. All this also makes the unrelenting torrent of Hunter posts on this subreddit look more and more like a pre-planned shill campaign.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Even though this is very draconian, at least try to be accurate. Yes there is a ban on household mixing, but only in enclosed indoor settings. This rule is also pretty much impossible to enforce for everyone as the UK government continue to drag their feet like usual. Also where in the article are you seeing this "only 1 social contact thing"? Can't seem to find it.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>The hard drive warranty implies that it was bought 6 days after Hunter supposedly dropped it off, and the metadata suggests that they were created years after they were supposedly sent/received. Also nobody has seen the original emails, just pdf 'copies'. It's highly likely that a lot of the information was fabricated and compiled as a smear campaign.</TEXT>
