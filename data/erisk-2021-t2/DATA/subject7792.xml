    <TEXT>So this guy at Bank of America is saying that he thinks the debit machine counted his money wrong... I'm pretty sure they were talking about checks. The manager says to the guy"Machines don't make mistakes. People do." Then when the guy leaves and they start talking about how they we're suprised that the money even went through... They had their armed guard next to the guy most of the time, and then they stood at the door watching him until he left. Not sure what was going on... But I wanted to laugh so hard when he said machines don't make mistakes.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I had a Seminary teacher have us draw the person we hated most, and then throw darts at the picture. It was supposed to be optional to do it and I said I didn't want to. They told me I had to, so I did... But I had no feeling behind it because I really didn't want to. Then the lesson went on to reveal a picture of Christ behind the board we had put the pictures on... I totally think the teacher should have let me opt out like I wanted to, because that would have been a better lesson.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I'm looking at purchasing the new Subaru Forrester Sport 2019... I want to make sure when I have them build it for me that I get all the upgrades that are worth it, but not getting the ones that are not... I can't build it until the end of the year, but I'm wanting to get prepared... Actually even if you have an older one that the options are still relevant that would be cool too. Edit: Wow thank you all so much for giving me your input! This will totally help me decide on what is worth upgrading! I was worried I wouldn't get much of a response, but this has been very informative. I look forward to to seeing even more great posts. Too bad about those stereo systems... It seems I might have to ask for a custom job on that? If anyone got the upgrade please let me know if you have the same issues, or if it really is better.</TEXT>

I tell her that it has already been claimed. She pretends that she didn't get the message that was sent immediately after the address was sent. Then she tries to argue that it is not yet Noon. I was like, what the hell? I told you I needed to be contacted by 12... I have delt with too many flakes on Craigslist, so I am strict about time. If she had called to confirm that she was going to pick up the ink I would have given her a bit of cushion for pickup, but she didn't even confirm. #128551;</TEXT>

    <TITLE>Unintentional Bloody Malicious Compliance With a Teacher in 5th Grade</TITLE>
    <DATE>2019-02-03 04:30:51</DATE>
    <TEXT>I had a math teacher that had a strict rule of no leaving the classroom for ANY reason without first consulting her. Preface: Now, all through school I had had a problem with each year I would get a horrible bloody nose due to the dry cold weather. I knew each of the school nurses over the years of school, and they knew to expect me in there office with a fountain of blood coming from my nose.  #8203; I was sitting doing homework when I felt a wet sensation on my nose, I automatically used the back of my hand to stop it from dripping and when I pulled my hand back I saw it was blood. MC= I knew my teacher had written someone up for a legit reason for leaving without asking her, so instead of rushing to the nurse I cupped my hands around my nose as it was at this point freely flowing. I walked over and asked my teacher if I could go to the nurses office (My hands couldn't contain the blood and at it has started dripping down my jacket). The teacher says yes! Go NOW! I tell her I need someone to open the door as my hands are filled. Someone opens the door, and I rush out. Now the door was to the outside and had a garden area, so since my hands are overflowing at this point. I'm sure some poor sap who has to maintain the garden wondered who was killed in that area, but at least I didn't have any blood disease or anything... I get to the nurses and she takes care of me, but is furious with my teacher and says she will have a talk with her about this. After the nose bleed she has me drink some juice and eat a granola bar, as I am feeling quite dizzy from the blood loss. I lay down on the bed and she lets me rest until I feel up to going back to class. My Mom was called to bring a new shirt as mine had been ruined. (I looked like I had killed someone in a very violent method, as the blood had also run down my arms...) She knows I get these nose bleeds, and wasn't too worried(I had seen multiple doctors about this issue), but was shocked to find out that the Teacher had made a rule that was so insane. I told her of the student who had gotten in trouble for a legit reason, and she actually thought it was funny I had bleed all the way to the teacher's desk. Consequently horrifying the teacher as I dripped blood from my hands in front of her. My Mom would have talked to the school, but I asked her not to, because I was already embarrassed about the whole thing. The next day my math teacher tells the class that if someone needs to go to the nurse they can leave without asking,and that she will just require a note from the nurse. I'm not sure if the nurse was the reason for the change in her policy, but it could have also been the blood trail I had left in the classroom when I went to ask her for permission to leave. Totally unsafely she had students clean up my blood trail instead of calling for a janitor to do a bodily fluid clean up. (I found out about this afterwards,but she had no idea if I had something that could be transmitted through blood...)  #8203; Also to understand the trimumphantness of this, she was also the teacher who had to apologize to the class because she called the entire class stupid because NO ONE could understand a particular math problem that she had not taught how to solve well enough. (I mean if the ENTIRE class got it wrong... it isn't the class lady!) She had the misfortune of having a kid who had a lawyer for a parent and he told his Mom, and she came in and let the principal know that if he didn't make her give an apology or if she ever did this again she would be taking the school to court for it... Well a LAME apology ensued after that,..  #8203; So the teacher got a bloody mess for being such a stuck up witch... Edit: apparently I need to explain that the legit reason the other kid had was that he needed to throw up...</TEXT>

    <TEXT>This isn't my story, but my sister's... One night she was driving home with a friend after a party. They were in the middle of nowhere and it was Forrest on ither side of the road. They noticed that a white dog kept popping it's head out of the brush every couple minutes always in front of them and then it would watch them until it disappeared, only to show up further down the road. At first they thought there was a pack of dogs since it had to have been going way faster than a dog could possibly run. They were getting a bit spoked at this point and decided to speed up. Their only issue was that the back of the van decided to pop open at that point. But they were due to see the dog show up at any second, so they decided if they went for a couple minutes without seeing the dog, the passenger would jump out and shut the back. They kept driving, but slowly and they didn't see the dog. Finally my sister stopped the car and the friend ran to shut the back. As she got to the back the white dog pops it's head out behind the van. They girl jumps in the van and they speed off, looking in the rearview mirror, the dog slowly walked to the middle of the road and then just sat down staring at them driving away...</TEXT>

    <TITLE>My Mom betrayed my trust... ?</TITLE>
    <DATE>2019-05-03 00:57:53</DATE>
    <TEXT>So, I feel like I should give a bit of my background to make this make sense... I have been treated for Borderline Personality Disorder, one of my symptoms is feelings of abandonment... I also have been diagnosed and am receiving treatment for Bipolar 2 Disorder. The difference between regular bipolar and bipolar 2 is that my heightened emotions are Suicidal thoughts starting to seem rational, rage, depression. My normal without medical marijuana is a state of constant suicidal thoughts. Every second of every day. With medical marijuana my normal state is the suicidal thoughts almost totally are silent. No constant thoughts of how I could use anything I can see as a means of suicide... Just the random thought that flitters away. Now I have a VERY strong bond with my Mom, but the rest of the family I don't. They have absolutely no sympathy for my condition, and think that I should just find something to distract myself. Right before I found that marijuana could make my life livable and even go so far as to giving me hope for the future... Well I was in the beginning stages of planning my death. Medical marijuana saved my life, literally. Now,my parents, my brother, and his family live within 30 minutes from my house and I visit usually bi weekly. My brother just got a new job on the other side of the country. My parents are planning to move with him to the other side of the USA. The new state doesn't even allow medical marijuana. My Mom was planning to move me with them since I need a strong support group to keep mentally well. I immediately looked up the marijuana legality issue and told her that until marijuana is legal over there, I would not be able to make the move. One night I started to have an extreme panic attack and I started texting my Mom because I could barely breath. I couldn't talk and kept getting dizzy from the lack of so I texted my Mom about what was going on. I told her of my insecurities and that even though I was putting up a good front for my siblings and would never let tell them, I was not happy about the news of everything. I was happy my brother was getting a great opportunity, but otherwise I was freaking out... And my suicidal thoughts were back... (I have learned years ago that I could talk to my Mom about this stuff, and she wanted to know when I was struggling with it). I told her everything I was going through, but I didn't ask her to stay because I know it would be too much to ask for. So I take a low dose of the marijuana to calm down because it's getting worse and then I start to feel better. So we ended our texts. My Mom usually knows what she can and can't share with my siblings.(Remember I told her I was keeping up a good front, congratulating my brother, and not complaining to them at all.) She goes and tells my siblings the whole damn thing! Then she thought it would be a good idea to tell me at work that my siblings said that I was making the choice not to go, and I just needed to get over my depression. They also told her that I was just trying to manipulate her. And so on and so forth. I was pissed that they would be so callus, but then I realized that, wait I didn't tell them because I knew they would react that way... Why did my Mom tell them things I had told her in confidence. I asked her. She said she didn't see the big deal and why was I so upset. I tried to explain it to her and she totally blew me off. I don't know this person, my Mom understands that I talk to her about things like I would with a counselor... How did she not see. But she kept insisting that she was totally in the right to have divulged the whole thing to someone I had told her I was purposely not telling... What the hell? Am I over reacting getting hurt by what she did, and am I over reacting by feeling like I can no longer trust her with sensitive information?</TEXT>

    <DATE>2019-05-30 04:34:09</DATE>
    <TEXT>I have a really old house (asbestos siding if that gives you a time reference) and I think it has the original septic tank (concrete) ... I'm low on money right now, and it has decided to... Well, crap... It's full and I need it pumped. I'm worried about having that done though because I can't afford to replace the current one. I have no other signs of issues, except my plumbing is getting backed up and our plumber said it looks due for a pump... I'm just wondering if someone comes over and pumps the tank are they required to report if a septic tank is... Questionable? Also, if I call them to pump, do they need to inspect it? No other problems I have noticed, even when I checked the web for signs your septic tank needs to be replaced. I'm worried, but I need this crap taken care of.  #128523; I'm mostly worried because a section of the underground plumbing needed replaced due to roots. And the house is like Uber old. 75 years I think... Maybe more.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I would say Most of the population is either confused or just happily ignorant about what pies our country has it's hands in. Well with a media who wants to discuss random things that are not worth watching, yet they don't even care about the things that matter... I don't care about Kim Kardashian or any other celebrities opinions about stuff that isn't related to what they do... Why is it that the media doesn't cover our actions in other countries on the front line news? I feel like the news has dropped the ball with reporting what is really going on. They just want ratings and talking about war and relief efforts don't bring a crowd after a while... So they half ass it. If there is a news outlet that covers that kind of stuff and keeps opinions out of it... Please let me know. I would watch that. The Hill so far seems to be the closest one I can find. Not to say we are any worse or better off than other countries... I do agree we need to clean up the parties. I listen to my own party, and they no longer have my best interest in mind... But the horrible part is that the other side has even less of my best interest in mind. Sorry if I rambled on... I am just so tired of all the corruption everywhere.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>No, actually let them know. I always feel awkward for just sitting down and watching TV while a "guest" is working... If more people were to say to me something to the effect of "Ok, so I am going to go do my work, I just need to know where you will be so I can find you if I need you." That is a subtle way to let let the overly courteous people off the hook. I was raised that if you are the residents of a house if a nonresident enters you take care of them. It honestly would be a relief to me... and to you just to let us know in a kind fashion. Just the perspective of a customer that tends to hover more than she should. But tries to just sit down and watch TV because I know hovering is annoying. #128530;</TEXT>

It frustrates the hell out of me and if I have poorly planned and my mood stabilizer is no longer getting full doses... Well I can't really hold in my annoyance at this. So we keep getting at each other's throats, and now after getting my medicine back to normal I can think to myself that arguing him is like playing chess with a pigeon in the end the bird just craps on the board kicks over the pieces and struts around like he won the game. I'm wondering when I asked God for patience... Because if I ever made the mistake of asking for it , I totally didn't mean to.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>The bottoms of the shoes of overpronators show wear on the inside edges of your heels and on the inside edges of the balls of your feet (the side toward the big toe). You seem to have this on one side. For #160;overpronators, the problem is that their foot is too flexible. The feet of overpronators collapse too much and don #8217;t get a good, rigid push-off when they step because their foot is rolled in onto their arch. Taylor explains this can lead to problems such as soft-tissue damage, ankle, knee, and hip-related running injuries.Experts agree that a runner who overpronates should be wearing motion control shoes. Motion control running shoes are constructed by using a stiffer heel and straighter last (or shoe form). In turn, this guides the foot and corrects weight transfer. #160;</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I went over to my parents house and saw my nieces... My sister and her husband don't understand that I almost never promise anything, but instead say that I will try to do something... Which is basically the same thing for me. I only promise if I am able to do the thing right then... So... It can get really stressful when someone is trying to make you promise something in the future that doesn't even have a set date. My sister doesn't understand that I help my parents on a regular basis, since I am the only kid who is nearby... So just because she has intensely been helping my parents for the week that she is here... That means I get to relax and not be the one helping. She seems to think that I never do anything for them and that I am a slacker or something... WTH? You have 7 days of work I have the rest of the year! I know I am just complaining... But you asked. My sister and I are like oil and water... I also have major anxiety issues when it comes to family, so that makes any interaction with several family members exhausting to begin with. Don't get me wrong I love my family, and I would love to be around all my nieces more... But it drains me to overcome my anxiety. Honestly I have come leaps and bounds from how I used to be. I used to interact for a few minutes and then go back to my room when I was still living at home. Now I can be out there with everyone for hours... It just takes it's toll.</TEXT>

I was at the end of my rope, and they had recently legalized cannibus in my state. I tried CBD and it didn't help... I then tried THC as a last ditch effort. It worked! I can keep my mind clear by taking it regularly. So basically I can say that weed helped save my life. #128513;</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Start talking to someone. Ask about them about themselves and answer any questions they might have about you. It's a great way to pass the time and you start to get to know people really fast. Plus if you are a really good listener, kind, up beat, and are trustworthy, people always are wanting more interaction with that kind of person. I might not be like that internally but I really don't want others to know everything that is going on with my personal life. I have generalized anxiety disorder... Or something like that... I find interaction with others to be exhausting, and emotionally draining because of my anxiety... But when I actually start talking to people about them it tends to help me with my anxiety. The focus becomes them and I get to direct the conversation with little questions and having common ground stories builds trust and companionship... When I break it down it sounds very manipulative, but manipulation is not always bad. Everyone manipulates some just are jerks about it and they somehow got the lime light. I try to manipulate those around me so that their life as well as mine is better... Nobody feels manipulated at the end of the day, and I have just improved both of our situations.</TEXT>

I mean if I am going to give someone unsolicited advice it's because I am trying to help the person. Example: someone on Offer Up had posted a ticket for sale, but had left the info needed to utilize the ticket on the picture. I advised them that someone could steal the ticket info and just print out a new one. They were grateful for the advice. This example is just an easy one to realize that unsolicited advice is actually a good thing half of the time.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>One of my cats taught me to never make a wish that I didn't really want to happen. When I was a little kid Oreo my cat attacked my arm and I had to have two guys pry him off of my arm. In anger I wished him dead, and within the month he had been killed by a raccoon. I have always felt responsible for that. Now every time I have the thought I wish so and so, I immediately think of Oreo and ask myself if I really would be happy if so and so happened. I take back most of my wishes made in anger and it actually helps me to gauge if I am totally over reacting.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>If it wasn't their cat, and stray cat then I think this kind of reaction from a shelter is not cool. On the other hand If it was their cat, then the fact that they were giving up the mom and keeping a kitten... They deserve the trouble, because obviously they don't see pets as family. Edit: An average cat litter is 3 to 5 kittens... So doing the good deed of taking them to a shelter would have cost this family between $600 and $1,200 to surrender just the kittens less the one they will need to get taken care of later. Then the Mama cat is going to be another $300. If it was a stray, who in their right mind would think charging the person who was nice enough to seek help for the kitties around $1,200 - $1,800 to take in the litter and get the kitten they want fixed and vaccinated. On the other hand if they only had to pay $300 for the one kitten they were keeping... That's fine... But if the police had to get involved I'm guessing it was a large amount.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I didn't read it as them wanting all of the stuff done, but more as the shelter forcing them to pay for ALL of them to be dewormed and fixed. Which is totally insane if they found the cat as a stray. A big reason that so many stray cats are out there is due to this kind of thing, it's ALSO not the family's fault for finding a stray cat. If it was a stray cat then the shelter should have directed them to the places that fix cats and then rerelease them. Yes, they should take the kitten they want to keep to the vet and get shots and fixed... Not everyone can afford to get a whole family of cats taken care of, but we can take care of the one we decide to keep. I have two cats that I rescued, they were ferals that were captured. I got them for free and then I was able to take the two to the vet to be fixed and given shots. I would NOT have been able to get a whole litter taken care of. My cats are well taken care of, even have a litter robot. Being able to afford taking care of one cat is very different from being able to afford getting a whole litter taken care of and then keeping just one of them.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Thank you for the back story. I was just going off of what was said in the comment I was replying to. With the back story of having taken care of mama cat for several months it is their cat at that point, and they should have gotten it spayed so no little kittens would be homeless... And for them to want to give up the one that they had been taking care of for months shows a lack of compassion... I couldn't imagine giving my boys up.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>You seem to have missed half of what I said, as I was saying that it should not be their responsibility if it's not their cat. But if you understood my position... then what you are essentially saying is that if someone can't afford multiple animals then they shouldn't have the one they can afford. Plenty of people can afford one animal, but can't afford multiple animals. You do realize that the comment said $300 each, not for all of them... I got my boys first visit for much less than that. (Fixed and shots) My boys were captured and I found them through the grapevine. They were free, but they needed the visit to be vaccinated and fixed. If you give them away to contacts, then it's expected that the people receiving the cat will do the first vet visit/ vaccination and fixing. I probably would have never gotten my cats if I had realized how expensive they were... But thankfully I didn't realize, and now they are my boys. I love them so much, and I make sure that they are taken care of. I had to adjust my life for them, but they are worth it.</TEXT>

Nope. Let take it one step further. 90% of marijuana users drank milk before ever experimenting with marijuana. This means milk is the gateway drink to drugs! At least if you use the same logic. The real truth in statistics: Answer what percentage of marijuana users proceeded to harder drugs? Then you will get the truth.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Not Catholic, but why does Catholicism make the church leaders abstain from marriage? Many of the Apostles had wives... So why must the priests abstain from marriage and then after marriage have sex with their wife. Honestly I think that they would fix most of the problem if they changed those rules. From an outside perspective that is why the Catholics have such a big problem with sexual misconduct. Can a Catholic fill me in on why priests are expected to abstain from marriage and everything that goes with it?</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I gave my two weeks notice two weeks before inventory. It was my way of giving the store manager the middle finger, the last straw was when they fired my former manager for something we are pretty sure that they staged. The person who was the "victim" of being called a bitch after she left the isle was given $100 and one of the best lower level managers was fired. My former lower level manager had been collecting complaints about our new store manager, since she was an uber #itch, and would treat employees like crap, encouraging back stabbing among everyone. The entire store was grumbling about the treatment, but this lower level manager was actually reporting it to the higher-ups. (Policy was that you would remain anonymous) The bastard she reported it to broke policy and tattled on the lower level manager. Then this happens... Coincidence? I think not! I figured if a star employee like her got fired...I had no job security. So since the #itch was on a firing spree (she had fired several other perfectly good employees. ) I figured I had no job security, so I quit... But I made sure to hold out until right before inventory. A couple other people decided to quit right after I did. I didn't keep it a secret that I quit because of the store manager sucking at her job, and that the lower level manager being fired was the last straw. It turned out to be a great decision. I don't regret leaving, I found a better job after I left.</TEXT>

But I'm tired of people getting so hysterical about the doomsday predictions. Prediction after prediction has not happened... Go back 30 years and look at the predictions/"facts" that were made by the same groups that are pushing the current climates change emergency/doomsday narrative... They have NOT withstood the test of time. Just remember the story of the boy who cried wolf... When someone keeps calling hypothesis facts, eventually people stop taking them seriously... Yes, the seasons are changing... I don't think anyone would deni that... But climate has always been fluid... Ever changing... I mean, if you want a natural example just look at the Ice Age ... People were not polluting back then so why is it melt? It's a natural thing to have climate change. I just don't believe getting hysterical about it will fix anything. Good intentions don't necessarily fix things... Sometimes it makes them worse.Example: California forest fires... They suppressed the small forest fires only to find out that if you do that, the forests become like a tinderbox... a ticking time bomb, one much more devastating wildfire than several small forest fires. All done with good intentions.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Make sure to get at least two kittens, contrary to popular belief, they are very social creatures. They will be able to entertain themselves, so it helps let out energy... Your furniture will thank you. If you can afford one, get a litter robot. I got one after realizing how often I had to scoop to keep the litter box clean... This automatically cleans it and I just have to pick up a bag and toss it. Watch Jackson Galaxy's before you get a kitten video. https://youtu.be/sg5o0gX7Tws He gives a ton of good info through out the movie.</TEXT>

Do it at home, it's legal (in places that legalized cannibus) to do that at your place or someone else's place, but in a car and in public it's not. I want the entire United states to legalize pot... But if people don't follow the rules in the places that have already legalized pot... Well that's a point that the opposition will press.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>My grandpa was in WWII and his base was under attack by the Germans. He hid under his bunk because bullets were going right through the walls and everyone was diving for cover. In the aftermath the Germans were going around killing those who survived, but the German who came across him looked at his name patch and didn't shoot him. (My family is mostly of German heritage... So German last name.)We believe it was due to the fact that his last name must have reminded the German soldier of someone from home or something... But basically I'm here because a German soldiery spared my grandpa's life.</TEXT>

I almost committed suicide due to the constant hate coming from her(even my friends from her other class knew how much she hated me, as she would talk about me to the other class...). I was a kid and had an adult heckling me, allowing, contributing, and even encouraging bullying towards me. I had major depressive disorder for 20+ years after that. I hope she found herself in a place like I was. I recently found a medication that works, and so I have gotten out of it. But I have no doubt that she literally destroyed the majority of my life.</TEXT>

Has actually been really a leading leader on hiring women to important positions. The CIA as an example: Trump not only appointed Gina Haspel as the agency #8217;s first female director but also made Elizabeth Kimber the first women to lead the agency #8217;s clandestine service  #8212; rewarding the CIA #8217;s  #8220;band of sisters #8221; who have toiled to keep the country safe since 9/11.

    <TEXT>I can empathize with those feeling though. Have you thought about going to a counselor? They are very helpful. Meditation can help. If you want exercises that help Marsha Linehan did a lot of work with DBT skills. They are coping skills really help. It's ways to feel ok. Also get in contact with friends and family. Talk to someone about it. And if you are ever really to the point of suicide, just don't. If you are in a state that cannibus is legal, then go to a dispensary and get some THC and get high. You will feel better for the moment. It will get you past the moment, and you will then be able to contact someone and get help.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Damn, I wonder if you were talking to a really new counselor... Or something like that. I hate that they did that to you. I was extremely cautious, and my counselor thought I had very light situational depression at first... Then I was tired one day an annoyed. So I opened up to him and I told him a big portion of what hell I had been going through. I was later told I major depressive disorder and another disorder And I was only asked if I felt I needed to be in a hospital, I said no. I went home. But then started seeing him twice a week until I started getting better. Maybe if I had told him everything at once he would have done the same thing... Or did you open up over several sessions?</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Yes, but the emotional manipulation makes it a scam. OP was scammed by a professional scammer. Think about it... If you never ask for money, you sound a hell of a lot more genuine. Also, if you don't beg for money and people see or know you are in need, they tend to be more giving and less on guard. It's a smart way to scam specifically because you never asked for money. If it had been me, thankfully I don't carry cash on me, so it would have probably been a $10 tip instead of a $5 tip. Not a big difference, but she would still have the same amount of karma against her in the end. So hopefully she will have something happen to change her outlook on life, and give up scamming generous people.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>My Dad who is only in his 60s is at deaths door, and has a very poor quality of life. He is in constant pain and constant nausea... His mind if going because of the pain medication... I'm torn between praying the doctors find a way to extend his life or that if the quality of life can't be improved, for him to pass on. I don't want him to go through the torture is going through right now, neither does he. I also work for my parents business, and it is currently failing after being in business more than 35 years. Connected to that is that I require cannibus for mental health issues and it has not been approved for mental health purposes in my state. Honestly, I was at the point of planning suicide, it was that bad of depression. I figured after over 20 years of being suicidally depressed it got to the point where I no longer could fight it. I was too tired. Then I had a prompting to try THC, a mind altering drug, and it altered my mind in the right way. I now have a clear mind, when before it was always a soupy fog of suicidal thoughts. So yeah, it's nessesary. THC pills have been the most effective medication I have used, yet it's not covered by insurance, and I still have to pay for it as if I use it recreationally. So I'm paying a pretty penny for my medication while I am neck deep in debt. I might look like I'm doing fine, but that new car I have is making life really hard because I didn't understand all the expenses that came with a new car. Plus the fact that while I was dealing with depression, I got a bad habit of shop therapy... So when people ask how I am doing, I lie. I say I am doing great. The closest I get to telling them is saying "as good as can be expected". Unless they are my extremely close friends and then I might actually tell them some parts of what is going on.</TEXT>

Even the murderers and rapists think that pedophilia is basically the worst crime out there. Yeah, if a person is attracted to children, but seeks help and stays away from kids... I feel bad for them, because that must be hell. But when they act on it, I believe they have crossed a line that you really can never come back from.

    <TEXT>I would have to agree with you on that. In the documentary I watched, they showed the statistics for rehabilitation and such... The numbers speak for themselves. Somehow Germany's "jails" work... USA ones just contain the criminals, they don't help them become law abiding citizens. It was actually in my Criminal Justice course, that I learned our jails tend to make low level offenders become high level offenders. My teacher was a cop, so law enforcement is aware of the problem... They even had us each design a juvenile detention center, that we felt would rehabilitate rather than encourage elevation in crimes committed. I designed mine like a coed boarding school mixed with a technical college. It even had a lap pool. I really didn't realize how bad the current system is/was until that class.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I most definitely agree that prisons work better if done the German way... The documentary that I watched showed the statistics, and the prison in the USA that was trying to adopt practices of the German prisons was showing improvement on rehabilitation of criminals, especially the lower level offenders... They had added pet care, and more availably to programs within the prison to develop sellable skills. From what I can remember (forgive me if I'm wrong, it's been like 10 years since the class) even the state run prisons do the same thing... So I'm not sure how much of it is to keep people in... Within the last few years they have had to release low level offenders, because of overcrowding... So I don't think they would hurt for more people anytime soon, if they used more German prison styles. I learned in my criminal justice course how our prisons actually encourage low level offenders to become higher level offenders by the need to become part of a group within the prison. So when low level offenders leave the prison, many of their strongest connections are with higher level offenders. They get into the gang on the outside and journey deeper into the criminal world. Then their fate becomes almost set in stone... Even our juvenile detention centers do that... That is sad. Our Police officers know, and my teacher (a cop) was definitely pro changing the system to reflect Germany's. Sorry if I sound scattered, it's really late where I am, and I'm about to go to sleep. To summarize: The USA would do well to study and implement a system more reflective of the German prisons.</TEXT>

I had been playing on the floor of my bedroom and an "aggressive house spider" came charging at me. I now have arachnophobia because of the incident. Those spiders a huge by the way. The reason it was in my room, was because my room had the entrance to the attic in my closet. I used to wake up to huge spiders on my ceiling...

    <TEXT>I'm allergic to the sun... So yeah, more harm than good is a definite for me. The best way to fight the sun is to wear stuff like the cooling under armour long sleeve shirts, and long pants that are cooling as well, and a hat or visor. (I can't wear sunscreen, because it makes my reaction worse, yes even the totally natural sunscreen) While my methods are more extreme than most, it's a very effective way to block the sun, and it won't wear off in the water. LoL On a side note SunPill has worked wonders for me with prolonging my allergic reaction towards the sun. It actually doubles the time I can have direct exposure to my hands, feet,arms, and legs... So about a half hour in the direct sunlight and I have to get out or I'm covered in hives... an hour and they will become blisters. Plus they are itchy. Yet I enjoy the sunshine... So cursed is the one that loves what hurts them the most... LoL, actually skin cancer is in my family history, so maybe it's a blessing in really good disguise.</TEXT>

The Mayor has too many hands in too many pies, so the rich are above the law... And our stupid Mayor also wants to appear to be charitable, so they can't enforce laws on the homeless. Then the cops are too lazy to go after the gangs that are starting to pop up in the area. Basically they have become more or less a really bad joke. Why do we pay taxes to have them when they don't actually enforce the laws on everyone equally. I don't hate them per se...

If so, is it worth losing your job, or even the stress of fearing a possibility of losing your job? I take it for medical reasons, so I m not really one to talk about recreational use... Other than that little bit.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I would want a tattoo to appear on my back of black wings, then when ever I want to fly the tattoo would transform into real wings... But because this is all magical, the wings would defy physics. They would be the size we tend to draw angel wings, and they would not necessarily need to flap to fly. It would be more of a physical manifestation of the power to fly, rather than the tool to fly.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I had a bad reaction to medication, and it got me super high. (My roommate said that I looked like I was on speed.) The scary part was when I was in the emergency room, and I plummeted. I became super suicidal and the stupid doctor was threatening me because I crumpled to the floor and was inconsolable. I told him what was going through my mind and he took it as a threat, rather than just me describing what my condition was. He threatened to have me committed. I had been taught by my counselor to keep doctors informed about my mental status, because it's not a visual thing. Instead of helping me, he made it worse and he violated my HIPA rights by discussing my condition with my roommate. If he had asked I would have allowed it, but he never asked for permission to discuss my mental health with my roommate. On the positive side, I learned to fight for my rights and to establish that I am just informing doctors about the internal fight that is going on.</TEXT>

A stalemate between the two decisions seems to be what I saw. So, you find that religion will always be the reason. Even when atheists in America do it... Since the reason atheists in America do it is societal acceptance, pressures, and normalcy from being a Christian Nation. Christians started the nation, so it became a normal thing to do. People started questioning why we do it... Claims were made and then studies done to prove or disprove the claims. Otherwise Americans would be more like other countries that basically only religion is the determining factor. Oh, and by the way I saw more penises than I ever wanted to see...

    <TEXT>Harry... in combination with the last name Butts. ... I was reading a news paper from way back in the day (we found it when remodeling an old house)and one of the people it talked about was a Mrs. Harry Butts. That means so jerk parents named their boy Harry knowing full well his name would be Harry Butts for the rest of his life. On the other hand, that woman must have really loved him since she would be reffed to as Mrs. Harry Butts the rest of her life. So kudos for true love and shame on the parents who thought they were funny.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I'm so sorry  #128148; That is always a hard thing to do. Our cat Midnight had to be put down last year due to injury. He had lived to the age of 15 years and was an outside cat. (So a long life for an outdoor cat, but we will miss him dearly.) I now have two indoor cats that needed me as much as I needed them. I can say from experience that while a new cat will never replace the previous one, it does help for me with the pain of losing a beloved pet. Taffy ,Midnight, Grimshaw, Kibbutz, Oreo, Rascal Flats, Black Bear, and our little gray kitten that we only had for a short time before someone stole him will always be remembered and loved. (Yes I have grown up with many different cats)Sometimes people feel they are betraying a past pet by getting a new one... I figure if you rescue an animal, you are instead allowing another cat another chance in life. Plus for me Mac and Tosh have helped heal my heart. (Grimshaw was my first cat in my own home and losing him ripped my heart to pieces, I was never going to get another cat... But then Mac and Tosh couldn't find a forever home and I caved... Best decision ever, they saved me.) Just wanted to give some advice I wish I had gotten before I made the stupid decision not to rescue anymore cats, because I couldn't handle the heart break... I didn't realize that while my love for Grimshaw will never fade, the painful memory of losing him has faded and the positive memories are what have stuck with me.  #129392; Now the little punks have taken over half my house.  #128514; That's cool, because they are so dang cute  #128525; God Bless!</TEXT>

    <TEXT>The crazy part is that a ton of the people who are talked about as having BPD on that hate group chat actually seem to be talking about NPD. The huge difference between the two illnesses is that the BPD doesn't do it for manipulative purposes any more than the average person uses their emotions to manipulate... When our Dr Jeckle becomes Mz Hyde... We almost feel as if we are watching a movie play out... Or maybe a volcano would be a better example. Some volcanoes in Hawaii constantly are spewing out lava, but it's easy to know where to be to stay safe. That would be the average person... But those with BPD are more like the Mount St Helens of volcanoes, where if you were anywhere in the state near it you were effected. It was devastating. One thing to remember is that from the ashes of a volcano rise the best crops, and the most desirable land. It's just the price you have to pay for the extremely good farm land.

    <TEXT>I understand self hate, but I'm not really understanding why you think kissing his friend AFTER breaking up is vile.(You didn't cheat, it was already over...) I do on the other hand understand how losing a best friend or favorite person would cause a lot of turmoil. I think you might be coming down on yourself too hard. Did any of your mutual friends say anything that made you feel they didn't want you to be around them anymore? I have had times when my friends just thought I wanted space, and only hooked back up with them because I desperately needed a friend... Only to find out that they were wondering when and if I would ever come back. I get into moods that I isolate myself to protect others from the extremes I experience... So people tend to leave me alone when I hide. Punishing yourself really isn't a healthy thing to do. More often than not it just causes more problems. Now, know that I am saying this knowing it's much easier said than done. You might also look into DBT skills to help.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Don't go off your medications without a doctor's approval! I have BPD and I have never understood why people will do that, as it's really very dangerous to do. Talk to your doctor and suggest you start a new medication, because you don't like the side effects of this one. I have gone to my doctor before and told them the current medication was not working and I have never had a doctor refuse to take me off one I no longer wanted to work with. There are usually alternative medications.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>No prob! I was on a medication that dulled all of my emotions(at the time that was what I needed), when I switched after 2 years of it I was surprised at how much it had numbed me. I was crying at every movie (weird to cry furring horror films, LoL) and a lot of random things would have me crying for joy or sadness. So when you do get off of it, just know that you might feel some intensity with the emotions that it was suppressing if you have been on it for a long time.  #128523; Having BPD you probably already know, but Incase you don't, you need to set some boundaries before you start coming off the medicine, you could very easily be extremely horny once the medicine wears off. And we tend to act on extreme emotions, so you don't want to make the mistake of acting on it in the moment. If you set up boundaries it can help you with not making mistakes if you get super horny. LoL.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>The reason goosebumps show up is a tiny muscle that surrounds the root of every hair #160;on your body. When the muscle tightens, a small bump appears on your skin. If you get too cold, your brain #160;alerts your body that it should take steps to warm up. Goosebumps are one of those signals. They're also an attempt to trap warm air next to your skin and let you hold on to your body heat.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>The time I had so high of a fever that when my Mom felt my forehead she jerked her hand back as if she had been scalded. I was hallucinating continuing a dream about being a soldier at war. I had crawled into a grave yard in the dream. I kept flashing in and out of reality, it was a miracle that I didn't fall down the stairs trying to get to my Mom. I was immediately put in a cool bath, and my temperature was taken at 104 F I didn't go to the hospital or anything, but the consulting nurse said if my fever went up even by a partial degree that my parents were to rush me in to the ER. Seems that it was a really close call, and in today's world I would have gone to the hospital for a fever that was inducing hallucinations.</TEXT>

My parents ALWAYS tell me they KNOW I can do whatever I have failed at, even if I let them know that I truly tried my hardest. That's the same thing as telling me that I never try hard enough. Side Note: I'm spiraling right now and it feels like crap. The company I work for just closed there doors because they can't afford to keep open. I have no job now and I am always terrified to look for a new job. Just took a 1.5 mile walk and still can't center myself...</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I had an outdoor cat latch on to my arm and attack with feet and teeth. I screamed and it took two men pry the cat off my arm. I respect some cats can't go from play time to cuddle time now. Although I never became afraid of cats, and actually have two indoor cats today. The way it changed my life: I was a little kid and had not learned the lesson not to wish for things you want when you are in the moment. I wished that our cat Oreo would die. He was killed by a wild animal that week. I have always remembered that and how I felt when I found out he had been killed. I cried and felt really guilty about it. Now even over 20 years later I still remember that incident, and it always reminds me to be careful what I wish for. Not sure if this counts, as the cat only mauled my arm...</TEXT>

If it goes through the correct procedure to become law, I wouldn't have an issue with it at all.

    <TEXT>LoL that one is easy! Would 100% not teach my kids homophobia. My experience changed my parents' opinion of gay people.I was a extremely homophobic little kid, but for my parents to see me figure out that I was a lesbian... They saw the depression I went through. I almost killed myself several times because I hated myself... I started cutting... I mean I was attracted to the same gender, I was a freak in my reality. I had been taught only perverts were into that... and that it was a choice. When they saw that I had no choice in the matter, they realized that it wasn't a choice. That the homophobia was rediculous. (Like my Dad was freaked out, almost to the point where it seemed he thought it would be contagious. He even freaked out when he saw me watching the Ellen show.) Now I am cool with being a lesbian and my parents, while worried about how to get me to heaven, love me the way I am. I honestly think it's sweet they worry about me, because I understand that the way I am living is not really all in line with what they believe is needed to get to heaven and be a family for eternity. I would be insulted if they didn't worry, as that would mean they didn't want to be stuck with me forever. LoL</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I might be a lesbian, but anyone can answer that. It's very different for different people. I had a crush who was super cute, until I actually met him. He turned out to be a narcissist asshole and guess what... It was almost immediately after meeting him that I was no longer attracted to him. *Yes, I'm a lesbian and had some crushes on guys... I was a kid and trying to figure it all out, but he was super feminine and I used to get teased by my sisters that he looked like a girl... When I was growing up it was still a very well used insult to call someone gay, so the thought that I might be gay hadn't even crossed my mind.What made him attractive to me was how feminine his features were... * On the other hand, I got to know a girl online and very much liked her... We swapped pictures, and while she wasn't my normal type, it was her personality that I was initially attracted to. After the initial shock of not having the image in my head be correct (it rarely is), I came to find her super attractive physically as well. It took sorting out my initial shock, but honestly it was her personality that I was most attracted to. So if you want a healthy relationship it's often the personality that is the make or break for relationships that will last. The girl who is only attracted to looks will eventually leave you, for someone who looks better. While the woman who likes to talk to you, and values your opinion is a keeper. Then again what do I know? I have not found a healthy relationship yet, but this is what all the books say.  #175;\_( #12484;)_/ #175;</TEXT>

I have had many conversations with people who don't wear masks and people have their own reasons, but the more common ones are government overreach and just simply that the information on it changes almost daily, if not hourly. So what the hell do they actually KNOW about this virus? Is the idea. I wear a mask out of common courtesy,(Plus I got a really cool one and it makes me feel like a little kid again! lol) but I understand not wanting to wear one because government officials are overreaching their power.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>We had a realtor that was the nicest person, I remember Peggy coming over to our house several times because my parents always used her. She loved to visit because she was mildly allergic to cats, but could still be around them... She would always make sure to say hi to our cat Taffy. She was very good at making you feel acknowledged... As a kid I often was shooed away by my parents, so having a business person who actually would acknowledged me and be ok with me listening in and learning... That was amazing! Please be this kind of realtor.  #9825;</TEXT>

    <TEXT>A flatmate offered to go with me to see a counselor if I needed some support, and revealed to me that seeking mental health was actually a show of strength by admitting weakness. All of us flatmates had been talking about depression and suicidal thoughts. I mentioned my issues with suicidal thoughts very lightly and nobody thought it was weird... I then afterwards was talking with her asking how often she had suicidal thoughts... She said it was not often, but if she was really depressed it would start. I told her I thought of it constantly and had even mildly attempted it. (Took a lot of pain pills) She then discussed with me that having suicidal thoughts constantly was not normal and I really should seek counseling. She mentioned that she was going to a counselor herself and that it really helps. I finally don't feel suicidal constantly, it took over 10 years to find the right medication, but I really appreciate that she offered to go with me, and that she let me know that going to a counselor was just going to the doctor for treatment. The only way it reflects on you as a person is that it shows that you are mature enough to understand that we all have weaknesses. That sometimes those weaknesses are something we just can't strengthen alone. Our mental health might even be more important than our physical health.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>2020 I got more confidence and started to workout. I have been able to lose a little over 50 lbs and that has helped with my confidence even more. I got a dog this year and I am currently working on my house. Negatives of this year is that I lost my job due to the social distancing, and had a crush friend zone me, but yeah... all things considered things are going pretty good right at the moment. I believe I was planning on how and when to kill myself in 2018... But it could have been 2017... So... Like I said all things considered... I'm much happier now.</TEXT>

I thought about calling my parents who lived pretty close to me, but decided I didn't want to wake them up. I kept trying to figure out where exactly the noise was, since it had stopped... But it sounded like something was in my yard at this point. I hear what sounds like my name bring called. I nearly died of fright, but it sounded familiar... So I followed the voice, then realized it was my Mom on the phone... Apparently my phone called my Mom and she was freaking out wondering why I was calling at 2am in the morning. I was super relieved. We talked about what I was freaked out about, and my Mom said it was probably just a raccoon, as they make noises that can be mistaken as a child screaming. But yeah, I was alone... and that noise was strange.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>That's good, as they need forever homes. Dogs are expensive and a lot of time and energy... Not everyone can handle being a fur parent. I'm glad to hear that you are doing your best to get them into furever homes. If I could I would take one off your hands, but yeah... Not possible. I want to get a second dog, but I can't afford one at the moment. LoL my new boy Jack is already hurting my pocket book... But the little guy is worth it.  #9825;</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Had a skinny bitch complain because she couldn't beat me in weight lifting... It was the only thing I excelled at in PE. The damn PE teacher started doing a body weight vs weight lifted. FUCK YOU LAURA! You can't be the best at EVERYTHING! I was a loser in middle school, and that bitch couldn't handle that the girls who usually did poorly in gym class regularly because of being overweigth. It was the only PE activity that I found to be fun... She fucking ruined it for me. GO TO HELL LAURA! Yes, still salty.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Calvin and Hobbes is one of the best cartoons ever! It gives us philosophy, but in a way that can be easily understood. When I took a philosophy class in college we looked at several Calvin and Hobbes comic strips over the semester. My teacher would start class with something that would catch people's attention, usually a joke or comic that had to do with philosophy. She understood that a 2 hour course was a bit of a stretch when you are used to 1 hour courses. Best teacher ever! Miss Sims, you are amazing!</TEXT>

I now have to deal with a very hard to deal with mental disorder and will probably never be able to totally forgive my Mom and Dad for it. I love them, but when the past abuse gets stirred up I spiral and feel like a passenger of my rage. I have pets, and learned early on to leave when I get really mad. But you can't just leave a little kid.</TEXT>

I have relatives who have birthdays all around mine, and she fell and hit her head a couple days before my birthday. She was taken off life support on my aunt's birthday and died on mine. My Mom's birthday is two days after mine and one of my cousins birthdays was the day after mine. I found out everyone was afraid of losing her on their birthdays, so I prayed for it to be mine... So while it was sad and sucked to happen on my birthday, I was actually happy it happened on mine rather than anyone else's.</TEXT>

I wanted a balance of the two sides of logic, not an extreme on either side. Instead of balancing our government parties have become more bipolar each year. And the leadership of both are narcissistic jerks. If it wasn't so sad it'd be funny how similar the two parties are when it comes to negative traits in leadership. At least that is my opinion...

    <TEXT>When I realized that basically every parent out there is guilty of child abuse at some point. Some just excel at it... A very sensitive and specialized "job" of raising children is given to novices, but "a thing worth doing is worth doing badly". In other words, even if children are damaged, they usually grow up to be functional adults... So at least the job got done, with relatively few casualties... is the hope. Oh yeah, and when our leaders, celebrities, and so on act like little children, bickering, exaggerating, and tattling... Then seem surprised that their target retaliates, or giggles when the other side reacts the way they wanted them to.</TEXT>

It's a good business practice for vets to do this, as it brings loyalty. I had to take my dog in to the ER vet this weekend, and the ER nurses were super helpful... I only hung up on hold because he had started to squeak through his nose... They gave advice, and were actually in the middle of getting more when I had to hang up and rush over. So, I only told my story as an example... But yeah. Good on you for rescuing! I have nothing against buying dogs from responsible breeders, but personally I think rescues are my favorite.

    <TEXT>Means that installing cameras in your car is a good investment. Then the bad police can be caught with their pants down, and can be socially pressured to be removed from position or have to be retrained on what is acceptable use of force. On the other side of things this is why America needs to get rid of the laws that make it so you can't go after them for abuse of power... (Since I hate "social justice") They need to be held accountable, but we also need to realize that they are human and make mistakes just like everyone else, it's just that their mistakes seem to hurt worse and more people. Watched a documentary on YouTube about a guy who was misidentified and beat to the point of needing hospitalized. He defended himself BEFORE they identified themselves as officers of the law. They were not uniformed officers, FBI and detective. They didn't apologize for the mistake instead they then charged him for 3 felonies pertaining to him trying to get away from what he thought was a mugging. He can't go after the FBI agent and detective legally because they are protected by the law. That is wrong, there is video proof of over use of force. And they actually had the cops called on them because people were afraid they were going to kill him. I think he didn't hit the news hard because they are focused on the abuse of power towards minorities getting this treatment... My opinion is it has more to do with America's unofficial class system. On a slightly different note : I would 100% want a Black woman like the one in the footage as a witness on my side after watching the footage. She was the one who was most outraged by what was happening, and was courageous enough to speak up. I don't know what it is but almost every Black woman I know has spunk like that, it's a trait I wish I had, so I totally look up to the Black American culture around women for being like that. ... Although an alternative of having a Karen of any culture would be great too... It would be like fighting fire with fire. LoL... Edit: Ok, I'm confused. I just got called a Social Justice Warrior, yet I specifically stated that I didn't like social justice and would rather have the law changed. That way we can prosecute in court. The problem is that right now our only real option is to use social means to force "justice". I want real justice, not this half assed bulldozer media and political judgement crap. Social Justice is too often wrong, and goes against my firm belief in the innocent until proven guilty system. Yes, it's a rant and it's long... I have nothing to prove myself as being right, and would love others to suggest other ways to fix the current situation, because this is the best course of action i can think of.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Yes, sadly in all systems of government, eventually they will be taken over by narcissistic bastards that will use and abuse the system of power. America has proven capitalism can be just as corrupted. I don't care who you follow politically, neither side has your best interest in mind. They have been bought off. When politicians come into office with average or above average wealth, and leave millionaires... You know that they made "deals" that had nothing to do with helping their voters, otherwise they wouldn't have needed to be paid off. They are no longer for the people, they have been purchased and have their own best interest at heart. No matter how much they kiss ass to the public, they will only do what they think will benefit themselves most in the end. A leader needs to be more interested in their follower's needs, than their own. Otherwise they are just a hypocrite with a lot of power, and potential to ruin stuff.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I have never lived in a communist country, so I'm not going to pretend to know what it's like. I have only watched countries fall apart or abuse their people under communist rule. I'm sure that those who live in communist countries have very much the same view as me, but from the other side. Like they get taught the evils of capitalism. The thing I have heard, from someone who lived in China was that the positive side of capitalism is not taught there or at least it wasn't when she lived there. On the other hand I have been taught the positive side of communism. I actually love the idea of it, I just think people are too flawed to not corrupt it. Now, I have admitted capitalism is corruptible too, but from what I see the people have more power to complain and get things changed in a capitalistic society.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I actually agree with you on that point. I think it should be a goal to live in harmony like that. I just think, that as a society our judgements in whom we have chosen to lead us throughout my life, that I have been old enough to care have been bad people...Too many narcissistic bastards. In my opinion, when Joe Biden was picked as the nomination this year the democrats done F'ed up. Not a chance in hell I would vote for that pedo, I'd rather have a misogynistic pig who cheats on his wife than a pedophile. I was backing Andrew Yang. I love his way to make my childhood fantasy a reality, have machines take over our Jobs, not in a bad way... But to give us more time with family and friends, doing important things that will make healthy adults, rather than these poor broken ones that are now becoming adult children because they didn't get enough attention and love as a child. If you want to look up the united order, it's a religious version of the communist society... I like it better, but again I don't think we as a people are ready for it. Now, I'm not saying that I want to force people into a religion. Please don't, mistake me of saying that... I'm just saying I like that model better. Mostly because from what I understand communism dictates your actions, where as the united order you are expected to self govern, and if you are not willing to do so you are asked to leave the community until you are willing to do so. So, I think we actually agree on more than we disagree on this subject. Part of the reason I wanted to agree to disagree, was because I do desire a solid community. One in which neighbors would help neighbors instead of building fences to protect themselves from real and perceived threats. Sorry, this one was pretty long... and mostly just a big post of opinions.  #128517;</TEXT>
