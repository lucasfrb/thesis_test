    <TITLE>Does anyone know any good sources on the empowering potential of humour in activism?</TITLE>
    <DATE>2019-09-04 17:11:21</DATE>
    <TEXT>This is a little bit out there but I am conducting some research around gender and sexuality for my dissertation and one of things that has come up a lot with my participants is how they use humour to make light of everyday experiences of sexism and homophobia. They are in no way diminishing how shitty these experiences are but rather ridiculing the absurdity of the way their oppressors thing in a way that subverts and reclaims power (I guess?). Anyway, because there are so many great well read activists on this page, I wanted to ask if anyone knew of any good sources that look at the power of humour in such circumstances. I did try Google but I ended up with a lot of shittystuff on how sexist and homophobic humour is good and not offensive, which is obviously a far cry away from what I'm looking for . Edit: just to give an example, one scenario was making fun of how gay the queer pride and all male straight pride parade was and another was joking about homophobes doing homophobia badly by showing me a really ridiculous comment that was supposed to be offensive but missed the mark</TEXT>

    <TITLE>Can anyone recommend any literature that challenges reductive biological understandings of gender and sexuality, specifically understandings that rest on differences in brain structure?</TITLE>
    <DATE>2019-10-19 09:24:58</DATE>
    <TEXT>I recently read a study that claimed trans people had the brain of the opposite sex, a similar claim that has been made about gay people in the past. Someone responding to article challenged the idea of a male versus female brain for not only ignoring a great deal of overlap between the brains of different genders but also failing to account for how observed physiological differences could be the product rather than cause of the social organisation of gender I.e. in a world less demarcated by gender or with a different organisation gender, such brain structures would look different. I'm already familiar with critiques around intersex so ut is this last part I'm most interested in reading more about. If anyone knows any could literature that focuses on how biological differences are actually created by norms, attitudes and behaviours, i'd love to hear about it.</TEXT>

    <TITLE>Can anyone recommend any good literature that explores how online activism, particularly LGBTQIA+ online activism, has enabled new possibilities for organising and resisting offline?</TITLE>
    <DATE>2019-10-22 15:14:04</DATE>
    <TEXT>Just to provide a bit of background info, over recent years, I have noticed a strong queer resistance to the commercialisation of LGBTQIA+ culture. Though the commercial gay scene/pride events have long been criticised for privileging white gay cis men, it is only in the last few years (in the UK at least) that I #8217;ve seen serious offline resistance to commercial gay culture. There have been lots of protests at mainstream pride events for being trans-exclusionary/whitewashing queer history, and there seems to be a resurgence of a much more politicised scene aimed at providing spaces for groups within the LGBTQIA+ community who have long been excluded/forgotten. Anyway, I #8217;m interested in knowing if anyone has come across any good literature that a) explores the recent emergence of this much more radical intersectional queer culture *offline* and b) considers the internet #8217;s role in facilitating this. There is lots of literature on how the internet has afforded LGBTQIA+ people with new opportunities for identity work, community building and activism *online* but I #8217;m interested in literature that goes further in considering how such possibilities online have enabled some of the changes I #8217;ve witnessed offline.</TEXT>

    <TITLE>A story about successfully challenging transphobia (as a cis person). I #8217;m not sure if this is the right place to share this but I thought I #8217;d share because it seemed to work.</TITLE>
    <DATE>2019-10-25 20:50:00</DATE>
    <TEXT>Before I start, I just want to say that I understand that what I #8217;m about to describe might be very difficult for a trans person if confronted with a transphobe but it could potentially be a useful technique for allies? Anyway, here goes. I was recently at a queer/ feminist conference having an interesting conversation with someone about how sexuality is fluid. To my surprise, this person went on to say how she didn #8217;t agree with trans women because she felt they were assimilating with a type of femininity that feminism has been trying resist. You know the score. Anyway, I was quite tired and socially anxious so I didn #8217;t start arguing with her (as I usually would). Instead, I just started talking about a few trans people I know that challenged her perspective. I spoke about how my one trans friend, who I #8217;ll call Adele, had issues with some trans women bullying her for not conforming to hyperfemininity and passing when she came out. I told her how this friend strongly identified with women who were caring and empathetic, like her mum and grandmother who were both teachers and activists, and that she rejected what she has has described as catty competitive femininity. Immediately this woman started talking about her own experience of feeling like she had to live up to certain types of femininity because of cis girls in school. I told her my friend described these women as the mean girls of the trans community, which she could really identify with. After that, i just said trans women, like cis women, express femininity in a range of ways, sometimes they hurt other women by expecting they live up to certain standards of femininity, but so do cis women. I said that if we want to critique that, shouldn #8217;t we just talk about shitty women behaving that way In general? To my surprise, she actually agreed. After that, we started talking about expressions of femininity in general. I mentioned that if she had an issue with trans women being hyperfeminine even if they were not pushing such femininity on to other women, that was different, but I asked her how trans women wearing say make-up or revealing clothing is any different from the many cis women that do the same? She couldn #8217;t answer. I didn #8217;t get into the whole discussion around how more normative expressions of femininity are not oppressive because I felt it would deflect from my aim for the conversation, which was to get her to see that regardless of where she stands on such issues of gender expression, trans women, like cis women, express themselves in lots of different ways and shouldn #8217;t be singled out. Again, if she has an issue with women wearing makeup, why single trans women out when cis women also wear make up. She seemed to buy it. I also mentioned that none of the trans women I know live up to the kind of femininity often presented by trans women like Caitlyn Jenner in the media (not that such expressions of femininity are bad thing, her politics aside of course) . I asked her if she had met many trans women, which surprise surprise she hadn #8217;t. I suggested that maybe her idea of trans women was limited by limited media representations. I asked her to imagine what I would think of cis women if the only cis women I #8217;d met were from magazines and TV. She got the picture. Anyway, sorry for waffling on. I just wanting to share this story because it was first time I actually felt like I got through to someone being so outwardly transphobic. I #8217;m attributing it to being non-confrontational, which has not been my usually method when handling bigots of any variety. *However *, I understand that this isn #8217;t always possible, nor should it have to be when facing confrontation! This isn #8217;t some attempt to tone police but for rather to share an encounter that actually seemed to get through a lot of the ignorance and misinformation that surrounding this woman #8217;s opinions of trans women.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Hi everyone, I'm writing a social science paper on the democratising (albeit limited) effect of digital media and communication. I've nodded to the fact that such potential is limited by digital censorship in various countries such as Iran, Belarus and China. However, this got me thinking about whether, or perhaps a better question would be to what extent, people in such countries overcome such institutional barriers through the likes of VPNs? Would ordinary people in say China have the skill to overcome such institutional barriers, and if so, does anyone have any idea how common it is for citizens to bypass such limitations. I am guessing some things have already been written about this but I'm not tech savvy and have no idea where to start.</TEXT>

    <TITLE>What do people think about gender differences in retirement ages?</TITLE>
    <DATE>2019-10-31 09:47:44</DATE>
    <TEXT>I was talking to a friend from The Czech Reblic Recently, and she told me that during communism, women were able to retire several years earlier (I think 5 years) for every child they had because women were required to work and often ended up taking on the majority of childcare. While heavily gendered and problematic, this got me thinking that perhaps that is one of the reasons women we're able to retire earlier elsewhere? And if it wasn't, shouldn't women taking on such extra work be granted earlier retirement? Here in the UK, there has recently been a big increase to women's retirement age, which has hit a a lot of women who had children and worked at times when men did nothing at home. And then of course there are all the women that still take on most/all domestic roles in addition to working full time. For that reason, I many women should be able to retire earlier, or at least, primary care givers who have also worked,i.e. mostly women, should.</TEXT>

    <TITLE>What do people on this page think about free speech?</TITLE>
    <DATE>2019-11-04 12:51:01</DATE>
    <TEXT>I know this is not strictly feminist but it obviously has implications for feminist politics and activism. I'm not talking about platforming or no-platforming but rather state censorship. A part of me would love nothing more than for the state to *completely* stop the spread of misinformation but I'm a) sceptical of the idea that state will ever have our best interests at heart when it comes to defining what is misinformation and b) worried that this will set a precident for censorship against marginalised groups in the future. Edit: I'm not someone who feels there needs to be less regulation than there already is. In fact, as a European, i would argue that some countries need more regulation. I think the definition of free speech in the US is particularly toxic and quite frankly, in the case of broadcasters like Fox News operating, not so democratic . However, i do have concerns with how governments may abuse such power against marginalised groups in the future. Im a feminist but wanted to ask this question to other feminists because in the past, I've seen other feminist on this group express some really interesting perspectives on the topic.</TEXT>

    <TITLE>I was just wondering what people here think about this article about not being into period sex?</TITLE>
    <DATE>2019-11-12 10:54:40</DATE>
    <TEXT>A few people on Facebook are labelling this misogynistic but I know lots of women who are also not into having sex during periods. I am sure that for a lot of people this is very specifically about period blood but given how many people are queasy around blood in general, I'm sure many would object to any kind of sex where blood was present. I've noticed that some people try to rationalalise such aversions with comments like 'how many guys objecting to this are into anal', rightfully exposing the irrationality around concerns around hygiene, which i totally agree with. However sexuality is not always so rational (and im not sure it ever will be). People don't always fully understand why they like/dont like various things, particularly when it comes to sex. If we were to start to get people to think rationally about this stuff and engage in sexual practices accordingly, there wouldn't be much grounds for people to be grossed out by the likes of feet and watersports when engaging in say rimming because the latter is no more hygeinic. It strikes me that a common denominator in what grosses people out in sex is anything connected with unfamiliar odour, which triggers feelings of uncleanliness *even* for a great many things that are more clean than many other things they engage with. Again, it's irrational but im not sure its always something a person change. I'd be interested in people's thoughts. https://www.facebook.com/10513336322/posts/10158393868391323/ Edit: i just wanted to make it clear that im not defending anyone who says period sex is disgusting because such statements are not only often hypocritical, as many saying such things engage in lots of things that are less clean than blood.

    <DATE>2019-12-02 09:24:19</DATE>
    <TEXT>Just to be clear, I'm pro choice not pro-life because I don't see a fetus as life, at least not in a human sense. However, I met someone recently who said he was pro-life and considers life to start at conception but would always vote for and respect the choice of those that are pregnant because his personal feelings on the matter are not relevant. I could have had an argument with him about how I think life doesn't begin at conception but I didn't because I kind of felt that doing so might be counter productive, *but* I'm happy to be challenged on this, especially given that his opinion was not without implications. For example, while he would always respects a person's decision to have an abortion, if his partner had an abortion, he would break up with her. I guess this could come down to the whole thing of freedom of choice not being freedom from consequences *but* such consequences seem unjust to me. That said, people do break up all the time when one person is ready to have kids/wants to have kids and the other doesn't, so I guess for him, conception is just one of the things that make him ready.</TEXT>

Interestingly, because her activist circle is very queer, she actually gets a lot of crap for passing as cis and wanting to medically transition. She has been called a traitor before. It kind of reminds me of the whole argument of whether women should wear make up or not. It's like, how about just let people decide for themselves. It's interesting that you bring up the colourism thing.ive been reading some stuff around racist sexual preferences for my PhD and of the studies actually looked at discrimination in relation colour. It was a study on Asians and lighter skinned Asians were not discriminated against to the same degree. Interestingly, the lighter skinned Asians also had more of a preference for white people and were more likely to discriminate against other racial groups.</TEXT>

    <TEXT> gt;That said, people regularly overestimate the power of parental socialization and underestimate the power of self-socialization and peer socialization. There are so many parents who are totally surprised that after raising their daughter without gender biases, she suddenly still enters a "frilly pink dress" phase. (As the researchers in this study noted, parental preference seemed to have no influence on that.) As a sociologist, I couldn't stress this enough. The only time I'd say parents can have a more significant impact on children is when parental socialisation results trauma, but even then, how that trauma is embodied and played out is constituted and reconstituted through a whole range of other relations. Peer relations, as you say, are often massively significant</TEXT>

While i agree that such claims are extremely rare, i wouldn't be surprised if they were more common in physically and psychologically abusive relationships. If someone is abusing someone, it kind of goes to reason that they may at the very least *threaten* to do this as a means of control. I've been with a controlling abusive partner (a man), and in my experience, those kinds of people do anything they can to make you feel powerless.</TEXT>

Abusers manipulate and control people in lots of ways, so it is the abuse in general that should be condemned.

Pop John Paul II was very much against them to the point of even blocking condoms sent to Africa. In Ireland, contraception was illegal between 1935 and 1980. I think since the aids crisis, catholicism became more relaxed on the issue but there are still many that hold on to the belief.

    <TEXT>Yes, I know, but this is probably because the catholic position on this is now a lot less extreme since we got the internet. Also, the idea of life beginning at contraception is fairly exclusively catholic from what i know, whereas the idea that life begins at conception is shared and still fairly dominate across most Abrahamic religions. It's not surprising that google has a lot more results for that, especially given that it's only the really extreme Catholics that disagree with condoms nowadays. Had we had the internet back when condoms were illegal im Ireland, those results would likely be much different. Most Catholics dont have an issue with contraception now, and those that do are not necessarily as extreme. I was in a high school in very early days of the internet. I imagine a lot has changed since then. For one thing, my teacher would be fired for saying what she did. Edit: if you google "contraception is murder" it doesn't conflate the two terms.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Of course it doesn't make sense, but since when has that stopped religious ideology. I was only sharing what some Catholics believe and what my catholic RE teacher taught us, i wasn't endorsing it.  gt;Replace the words with synonyms and what they're saying is "life begins at condoms" That is exactly what they are saying, hence why some Catholics equate condoms and masturbation with murder. It is completely illogical but some do believe that (thankfully not so many anymore). This is why the catholic church has been slower to accept condoms than other Christian denominations. The idea that sex is for production and life beginning at conception was dominant across all branches of Christianity, but Catholics attach moral value to the wasting of sperm itself. I guess their logic (absolutely not mine) is that God intended that sperm to become something and therefore condoms kill the life that God creates. This is not just my RE teacher. My Catholics friends and parents had similar experiences. My mum is also an atheist now and we have had discussions about this. Perhaps it varies between places but this was definitely a commonly held belief in Ireland at one point (and my family are Irish Catholics) Edit: its not like extreme Catholics are known for adopting their beliefs to scientific reality</TEXT>

    <TEXT>It is a mindfield to be fair haha. Also, I don't know where you're from but remember catholicism is a lot older than other denominations of Christianity, which is why a lot of Catholic beliefs are much more strongly linked with superstition and disconnected from logic and rationality. Take for example the wine and bread Catholics receive at church. Catholic doctrine holds that this is the actual body and blood of christ, where as protestants believe that this was just symbolic, hence why they don't receive communion in church. It is probably also worth considering how catholicism has a much harsher and oppressive history when it comes to sexuality, and the idea that condoms equate to murder is obviously much more effective at preventing their use than the idea that sex should only be about reproduction. Of course none of it makes sense but for a long time, people believed this stuff anyway, and there are still plenty of followers that still do. Edit: interestingly though, in the UK, Catholics are actually less conservative on sex than protestants today. I think this is because the history of catholicism in the UK has been a lot more oppressive than other catholic countries, which I think has led to many Catholics being highly skeptical of the churches intentions. Take for example sex before marriage and pregnancy out of wedlock. My great grandmother was disowned and sent to England for being pregnant. This was extremely common. Many women in Ireland were even institutionalised (and killed) in convents. There is a great film on this called *The Magdelene Laundries*. However, my partner is polish and he told me that while such women we're judged harshly in Poland, it was never quite as extreme. I think this may be why there has been a lot more anger and resistance towards the catholic church in Ireland amongst Catholics than in Poland.</TEXT>

    <TEXT> gt;I told my husband i don't wanna know about her and her baby. Generally NTA but i would say that this potentially could make YTA. It is possible to be supportive and listen to your husband whilst setting up boundaries for contact with them. She is still his sister, and he is still his nephew, so this comment seems a little harsh. You can listen to him and support him without having them around for dinner. I think there is some middle ground here.</TEXT>

    <TITLE>Is anyone aware of any research exploring whether or not internet users politics differ from non-users?</TITLE>
    <DATE>2019-12-15 15:47:59</DATE>
    <TEXT>Here in the UK, there has been growing polarisation of voters by age. Interesting, social class is no longer a strong predictor of voting behaviour but the division between older and young people seems to be growing . I was wondering if anyone had looked at this in relation to the types of media people consume, for example, whether older people being more likely to rely on broadcast media and newspapers makes a difference to younger people with access to a much wider range of sources and political participation online. Perhaps older people that use the internet are less conservative than those that don't? I know there has been a lot of critiques about the internets participatory democratising potential give that online news consumption is not inherently active so the internet may not make as much as difference as i imagine but it would be interesting to engage with some studies that have explored this</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Thanks for this. This is all still really helpful. There is a lot of literature on online news consumption and online activism that I've also found useful but nothing that looks at differences between internet users and non-users.  gt;there online news sources are a combination of algorithm and self selection making cause and effect difficult to separate  #8211; Definitely. I dont think it is possible to say the internet is automatically any less biased. I guess like anything, it comes down to how the internet is used, which depends on a whole range of variables. However, there could still be some differences between say online and offline news consumption because of the more participatory nature of online news consumption (i.e. sharing, commenting on existing material and people producing there own material). That said, self selection bias and filter bubbles call into question the extent to which the internet empowers users. Not everyone is so active in how the use the net. That said, there is some evidence that internet users are exposed to a wider range of ideas and perspectives despite filter bubbles, but nothing I've seen has looked at this in relation to age and political attitudes.</TEXT>

    <TEXT> gt; 1.  #8288;Offering to carry my stuff. Ok, if you offer once, I decline and you're ok with it, I guess i could say it was nice. Even if it's really weird that you decide to be nice only to women. But if I decline and you keep insisting, sometimes with comments like "oH c'mON you're nOT gOiNg to cArRy tHaT by yOuRsElF!!" or "aw, you dont let me feel like a man", or even trying to grab my stuff without my permission... Ugh. That's not nice and I cant imagine why anyone thinks he's being nice in such situations. The only time I kind of did this was when a friend/boss was carrying a ridiculous amount of stuff from a conference to the tube, which was about 10 minutes walk away through crowds in London. She had a bagged up dismantled swing that she brought for an art project and a massive suitcase. I got the impression that she was saying no because I #8217;m a guy and she was making the point that she didn #8217;t need my help because she said she could manage as she is always lugging loads of stuff around. I made a point of making sure she knew that I knew she could manage (that was never a question), but as we were both going to a meal together and I was only carrying a small backpack, I just said,  #8216;are you sure? I honestly don #8217;t mind. I know you can carry it but there is no way I would want to lug all that stuff around on my own. #8217; I #8217;m not sure if this was the right thing to say or do but she smiled and accepted the offer. I got the impression that she knew that I would also accept help from her and that if she had been a guy, I would have also offered to help. In fact, the only reason I #8217;d not offered to help anyone else at the conference was because nobody else could have managed bring so much to begin with. She is more capable than anyone else I work with so I didn #8217;t for one second think she *needed* my help.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I can recommend a few books. They don #8217;t necessarily use the term toxic masculinity but they explore some of the issues you raised. Walkerdine and Jimenez #8217;s *Gender, work and community* is very good. It explores intersections of masculinity and class in relation to industrial history and the profound sense of loss that has accompanied deindustrialisation. Bell hooks has also written a lot about black and working class masculinities, and the impact of limited possibilities of competing for status has on avenues for otherwise proving and validating self-worth. If i remember correctly, her book * Feminist theory: from margin to center* tackles this . In both cases, what is identified is almost an overcompensation of masculinity because the status promised to white affluent men through competition is harder to achieve for men marginalised by race and class..</TEXT>

It #8217;s hard not to be hurt when you hear someone say  #8220;I hate men #8221; or whatever. This is such a great response, especially this bit because I feel that if someone is willing vent about others in this way, they should be willing to take it when they are the ones with privilege. I guess for me, the only time i'd consider the use of such statements wrong is when a person is not willing to allow other marginalised groups to express themselves this way because such hypocrisy is a mark of privilege. As a man, I used to take this kind of thing personally but then I realised that I myself used such hypocrites against other privileged groups because I'm also working class and queer. I use hyperbolic statements like this when frustrated by class/heterosexual privilege quite often</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Perhaps I've misread you but if you acknowledge that men are all different, then what is wrong with using words like fem to describe different experiences of being a man that come with presenting as feminine? You are right in saying men shouldn't have to describe themselves as fem but unfortunately, we don't live in a gender neutral world so being fem *is* something that marks my experience of being a man as somewhat distinct from gender conforming men. I identify as a femboy because this experience has become a part of my identity. I also want to make a point of reclaiming fem as something i am proud of in world where my feminine traits have so often been marked as shameful. I am proud to be a femboy in a world where 'fem' and 'boy' are so often held in opposition.</TEXT>

    <TEXT> gt; if you ask most people "are femboys men" they will either "have to think about it" or say no. To be fair, if the -boy in femboy isn't able to signify that someone is a man, those people really don't have a good grasp of the English language (and English is my 2nd language). Not only that, fem- refers to how i express myself, not my gender identity, so those that fail to see that fem and boy do not oppose each other are conflating gender expression and gender identity. I think you will be hard pushed to find any femboy that identifies as a woman, so this is nothing to do with what those words represent to me, it's to do with people with different identities projecting their own expectations on others. If they don't want to identify as femboys, fine, but how others describe themselves is really none of their business. If they don't understand and know what femboy means, they can ask someone who identifies as such rather than just assuming they know what it means. Edit: i feel like comments such as 'femboys is insulting' are symptomatic of a society and culture which constantly tells people how they should identify and express themselves. I know that you didn't say that but that was the original post i was responding to.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Ah ok, thanks for this. It's useful to heard from someone who knows more about the US context. It is useful to get some background on things that wiLl have affected her political compass position.  gt;It is true that the U.S. is significantly more right-wing than Europe overall (at least when it comes to economic issues - it is arguably more left-wing on social issues, like LGBT rights). Going slightly off topic but as an LGBTQ person i have to disagree with this (at least in terms of western Europe). Europe has anti-discrimination laws protecting LGB and T people in housing, employment and access to goods and service. These things are protected by EU law so apply even in the more socially conservative countries in Eastern Europe. Also, many countries in Europe have had marriage and adoption far longer than the US, and hate crimes against LGBTQ people (particularly violent hate crimes ) are much lower.  gt;I'm not sure why your co-worker thought she was right-wing She may, like me, have lacked a good understanding of her and put too much trust in the article i shared. Also, she is from Sweden which is particularly left even by European standards so perhaps that skewed her judgment?</TEXT>

With the exception of Poland, most other non-western European countries are very small populations. Population wise, western Europe is definitely the majority of Europe.  gt;I'll take the most of the U.S. for being trans above pretty much anywhere else in Europe - including many western countries like the UK or Sweden. I can't speak for trans but as a queer working class person, the healthcare alone would put me off the US. Not just that, i feel the threat of violence is always such worse in the US even for those that are not queer nevermind those that are. The countries you mention do have transphobia but violence against trans people is minimal in comparison to the US. Have you come across any research that suggests these countries are more conservative for trans people because i know LGBTQ people in all the countries you mention that definitely consider most of the US more conservative because of how.mich more religious it is. Religion is quite rare in the UK. Ive never even met a young person that goes to church. Im surprised you mention Portugal as somewhere you'd live because I've lived there and it is far less progressive for LGBTQ people than Sweden and the UK. Spain and Portugal are not at all alike on that front. Perhaps its different for trans people but for LGB, its really hard there in comparison to other western European countries. It's even more conservative than some former communist countries like Czech Republic.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Ah ok. For this i would guess that family is probably more accepting here because of our lack of religion (but this may vary in more religious nations like France). I think that the thing we have a problem with here is that trans people are misgendered and not recognised but there is no religious morality attached to the way trans people live their lives if that make sense. I think this is probably why we have less violence against trans people. It's not that trans people are seen as immoral or bad but that they aren't recognised, which of course if problematic in a whole range of other ways but i think it probably results in less violent hatred. When it comes to family, i feel like the limit of any kind of moral code on LGBTQ lives probably makes it easier for families to learn to get over over their prejudices when faced with potentially losing their kid over it. I know quite a lot of trans people and only one wasnt accepted by family, and that one person is from a strict catholic background. Edit: I've just looked up trans rights in Europe and I'm really surprised. We do have EU wide protection for trans people on employment but trans hate crimes are not protected EU wide. I'm going to educate myself more on this because i didn't realise trans rights were so behind. I knew that trans people struggled more but i thought that legally, they were protected the same as LGB people</TEXT>

If I like wearing them despite cultural norms dictating otherwise, I don't see why some women would not feel the same. Even if we lived in an ideal world where women were not expected to wear them (or to go to the other extreme, where women were judged for wearing then) I think it's fair to assume that some women would still choose to wear them because some men choose to do under those circumstances. Obviously cultural norms and social expectations placed on women will impact the extent to which women wear such items so I agree that those expectations should be criticised, but that can be done with casting judgment on individual motives for wearing them.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I was particularly surprised by Haraway as well, mainly because i consider her work more radical (not that Butlers work isn't radical).  gt;It's worth considering the fates of lots of people (men and women) who were brilliant progressive radicals in their 20s and 30s and then started slowly inching rightward as they got older Yes, i think this is a really good point. I know this is true of older relatives in my family. However, my relatives cynicism made also made them more apathetic and less politically engaged. I guess I'm still surprised about these two academics because their work is still radical. If there work had also become more normative i wouldn't have been surprised. That said, neither of them speak so much about class politics in their work. I guess i just assumed their class politics would be more radical because of their work in other areas.  gt;to the point that you hear about a prosecutor who threatened to imprison poor and working class mothers when their kids missed school and think to yourself " So admittedly, when i wrote this post, i put a lot of trust in how the article positioned Harris but I'm not from the US and didn't know much about her. Some of the people who responded said that she isn't that right wing but this suggests otherwise. I was never suggesting she was a republican or anything. I knew she was a democrat but the democrat party, like the labour party here in the UK, houses a lot of fairly right wing candidates. For a long time in the US and UK, the so called left has been dominated by centrists that in reality are pretty right of the centre when it comes to economic issues. This comment about working class mothers actually goes beyond the kind of thing i would expect to hear from those centrist Blairite candidates. In the UK, i can't imagine any labour leader, even someone like Blair who Margaret Thatcher declared her greatest achievement, saying such a thing. This is the kind of thing i would expect to hear from and out and out Tory (conservative). Perhaps this is an isolated incident but based on this of alone, I'm actually quite shocked and disappointed about Butler and Haraway supporting her. As i mentioned elsewhere, it could be that i am just too detached from American politics to be able to empathise with their logic. Perhaps they feel like candidates like this are the only ones who stand a chance of winning in the US but, correct me if I'm wrong, it does seem that this is not the case with the rising popularity of people like Warren and Sanders. Edit: just to go back to my point about being surprised at Butler and Haraway because they are still very much active in politics and academia, as a phd student, the older academics i work with in social science and cultural studies are all still very left. I always put this down to the fact that their lifes work has involved keeping up to date and informed on social issues and polticis. I feel that unlike many younger people who become more conservative as they get older, life has not got in the way of them continuing to be politically active because it is their job. However, when it comes to people like my parents, having kids and working full time meant they had much less time to invest in politics. This is all anecdotal though!</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Except the OP wasn't asking them to be quiet. They were free to play together downstairs. The only boundary in place was screaming outside the bedrooms. That is not unreasonable at all. I have similar experiences to what you described growing up but this is hardly the same. Its not like the kids are on their own and have to sit in silence. Also, he is only asking them to keep the noise downstairs for an hour or so after they wake up.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>True, although if that was a reward he promised on the condition they were quiet, i think taking them would have sent mixed signals. He could always give them a chance to earn that back the following day. I wouldn't have took away their games though, but that's just me. If it works, it's only a couple of days and they get their fun uncle back. There are many uncles that wouldn't punish nephews/nieces so harshly but at the same time wouldn't spend so much time keeping them entertained. My uncles let me get a way with murder but from what he has described, i'd of much rather have had an uncle like this as a kid. It sounds like they get a lot from him so even if sometimes that is taken away when they misbehave, it still sounds like they have a great uncle</TEXT>

    <TEXT>As we were talking about US politics the other day, can i ask if there are any well known US politicians you would label as centrist because i feel there may be some differences in how this term is used in the US and UK. For example, here in the UK Tony Blair was considered a centrist even though he represented the left political party. That was because he was economically right even though he was socially left. As such, Blairite has become a synonym for centrist here. When we discuss US politics here, people like Obama and Clinton are also frequently positioned as centrists for similar reasons. Is this also the case in the US?</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Thanks, this is really helpful. Its great to learn more about this because most of my knowledge of US politics comes from mainstream news coverage.  gt; I would also say Obama was - though he enacted a lot of change in social policies, more so than Blair, to my knowledge I'm not sure on this to be honest because i dont know enough about Obama. I know Blair did a lot for LGBTQ rights. He removed section 28 (a homophobic law enforced in schools), legalised adoption (which included adoption from religious adoption services), offered equal immigration status for gay couples, legalised civil partnerships, introduced employment and housing protections, and introduced the first gender recognition act. To be honest, i think almost all present LGBTQ rights and protections were secured under Blair. I think for his time, these changes were fairly radical. We have had employment protection and adoption for almost 20 years now, which was way before a lot of places. I dont know too much about his social policies beyond LGBTQ politics if im honest but from what i understand, he was pretty socially left in terns of social policy but right on economics and actually really neoconservative when it came to foreign intervention and war.  gt;In the UK, I suspect these Democrats would fit the Lib Dems most naturally, though New Labor overlaps that, if I understand it correctly. Yes, you are right. New Labour was pretty much where LD is now, although i think that LD used to actually be slightly further left than New Labour (although it wasn't perceived as such, hence why Thatcher considered New Labour such an achievement. They were successful at marketing themselves as left while continuing the neoliberal project.  gt;Rather like British right-wing press claiming Miliband was the most commie communist that has ever communed with the spirit f Marx, if I correctly understood how he was portrayed. Haha yes, until Corbyn arrived. Corbyn was considered much further left than Milliband.</TEXT>

Once you have been allowed grow up, you can't become a child again. This woman should respect him as the *adult* his mother raised and not try to undermine the autonomy his mother gave him by treating him like a child again. What better way of honouring his mum that being the man *she raised* rather than the man his step mum who hardly knows him wants him to be. I think this woman is being massively disrespectful to his mother by pushing so hard to fulfill this role. Its actually quite abusive and im all for disrespecting those kinds of people.

There are some fetishes which are near enough impossible to dislodge, for example, things like foot fetishes. However, when it comes to things like race, fetishes emerge from racial features in relation to problematic stereotype and misconceptions. When those misconceptions are dislodged, race as a object of attraction no longer holds it's appeal because the fixation was never just on racial features, unlike say the foot fetish which is an attractions that develops much more disconnected to society and culture.</TEXT>

They were both Czech working at a hostel in Prague. Czech professional culture is not usually gendered in this way because being too friendly and overly familiar with strangers is considered rude in Czech culture and isn't expected from men or women. This is often why tourists often consider service in Prague cold. However, western (particularly British and American) tourists are more likely to complain about Czech women behaving this way because the women in particular are behaving in ways much further away from western gendered norms .</TEXT>

    <TEXT>It could be either/both narcissism and anxiety to be honest. NPD and anxiety disorder *can* interlink and are both often associated with trauma. It is impossible to diagnose what it is 'more down to' from the limited information available. To get at the root cause a thorough psychological assessment is needed (and I say this as someone with a PhD in social science and psychology). No medical professional worth their grain in salt would be a quick to diagnose this as narcissism without further evaluation. The behaviour is typical of people with NPD but anxiety could also trigger it. Due to the lack of information available , I have given her the benefit of the doubt and suggested it could be anxiety related. I would not rule out narcissism but I also wouldn't be so quick to label her a narcissist. Also, even if she does have NPD, her narcissism would trigger anxiety when she isn't centre of attention. NPD is a lot harder to treat but it has in many cases been treated to a degree.  gt;she probably won't even acknowledge that it's a problem, never mind address it. You don't know this. While it is true that people with NPD are often reluctant to acknowledge they have a problem and seek help, this is not always the case. We don't know how she as an individual will respond to the advice here. Either way, we are in agreement that this behaviour needs to be addressed if not by her, by the OP.</TEXT>

If they value other attributes, I disagree that this is objectification because the desire for dark eyes, while exclusionary, would be in relation to other things that make up a person as whole. If this was the case, they wouldn desire anyone with dark eyes because it would never just be about eyes. Given that being attracted to dark eyes doesn't exclude any given race, I don't see much wrong with this. However... *I'm only dating my girlfriend because of her perfect dark eyes*  gt;Yikes. Not only is this objectification out the yin-yang, but you should probably see a psychologist before you wind up as a season premiere for whatever tv show replaces Criminal Minds. For realsies. This is most certainly objectification because it reduces a person to nothing but their eyes. Edit: to link this to a fetish of my own. I have a foot fetish. For me, nice feet and a partner happy to indulge my fetish is necessary for me to have a sexually fulfilling relationship. However, I'm not with someone because they have nice feet.

    <TEXT>I mean, there isn't really a democratic mandate, and i say this as someone who would never support LD. The leave campaign was found guilty of being in breach of electoral law. Had they overspent as they did in a general election or legally binding referendum, there would have been grounds for the Supreme Court to *enforce* another election/2nd referendum. However, because the UK only has advisory referendums, the court couldn't invalidate the result because the result was never sovereign. As a result, we have ended up with an advisory referendum being used to push for something that would not have been allowed from a legally binding one. This is far from democratic. That said, i agree that the position on the EU is complex and that there are good reasons for wanting to leave. However, i think the leftists that voted brexit are idealists. I hope I'm wrong but what i feel they have voted for is for the UK to become the 51st state of America. I think that rather than resisting neoliberalism within the EU, brexit is just going to result in even more neoliberalism and lack of state regulation because the British electorate is ideologically closer the US than it is to many countries in the EU.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Perhaps, although i also don't see the harm in that particular bias. Unless it feeds some kind of systemic oppression, i kind of feel like it is nobodies business and perhaps even wasted time and energy that they could use to reflect on things that do contribute to systemic oppresion. I don't have dark eyes but I'm not about to start a social justice campaign against those that wouldn't date me for it because while it isn't something i can ontrol, and something i may be excluded for, I'm certainly not marginalised by it, and to suggest otherwise kind of undermines the real importance of focusing on preferences that do emerge from/ contribute to systemic oppression. I feel that my and their time could be better invested in focusing on the stuff that is systemic. I'm sure someone with such a dark eye fetish, like all of us, has hundred and one other things they could be working on about themselves that contribute to systemic issues. Id rather they focus on those things, and i say this as someone who is systematically discriminated against in sex and relationships because I'm a feminine gay man and masculine gay men are higher valued. That and things like racism are are things i think people should spend time reflecting and working on. I think it's also worth recognising that we all have biases and none of us will ever be 100% bias free, so the best we can do is work on ourselves to the best of our ability with the limited time we have. I feel like in the world we live in, we should prioritise the systemic stuff given that even that is not something that any individual will ever truly break free from. As black gay man i know once said to a white and primarily straight group of University students he teaches, he knows they are racist and homophobic because even he is racist and homophobic. If he cant fully eradicate biases internalised from growing up gay and black in a racist and homophobic culture, his white straight students sure as hell cant. However, what we do is work on understanding and lessen our biases, but this takes self reflection and time invested in understanding of where these biaes and fixations come from. I feel that it is not only easier to address biases emerging in relation to things like gender and race as opposed to something as arbitrary as eye colour, but also, i feel that it's important for people to prioritise those biases. Edit: i guess i see the discrimination from eye colour as being something that occurs at an individual level (a bit like when an individual black person is prejudiced against white people). It is no a systemic social problem and i feel social justice should be focusing on systemic social problems.On an individual basis, there are a million and one things that may make us unattractive to someone. I feel.that it only becomes problematic when those thing emerge in relation to sexist, racist or classist norms. It is then where i feel reflection is needed but outside of that, i think a persons sexuality will always be discriminatory and exclusionary in certain ways at an individual level. *only* dating people with dark eyes is very discriminatory but it is still at and individual level</TEXT>

    <TEXT>No it's not rude. Not everything means the same outside of your culture. As I mentioned, In Czech it is considered rude to be overly friendly. Service can come across cold because of *cultural differences* but it isn't as if the workers there are shouting or getting angry with customer; their expression is just fairly neutral and direct but that can come across as rude to people from different cultures. If they started providing American style customer service, many locals would find it strange, fake or even rude because it is considered overly familiar and unprofessional (the opposite). However, as mentioned, western tourists often give Czech men a break because their formal and distant manner is more likely to be read as professional. To a Czech person, it is normal whether from a man or woman. There is no gendered expectation in this regard. I am not Czech but I lived there for a few years. When I first moved there I did think people were cold and therefore rude but once I got to know the culture, I realised it was just different. People are quite distant and formal with strangers *but* when you get to know people, that changes. The thing I loved most about this was that at no point did I ever experience anyone being friendly unless they meant it because until someone gets to know/like you, the relationship is distant by default. There was something really honest about this. Nobody pretending to like anyone they couldn't possibly know they like. If you are visitng a foreign country, locals shouldn't have to change cultural norms to please you. If you don't like the culture, don't go, or better yet, take the time to get to know the culture.</TEXT>

    <TEXT> gt;having many options in Tinder Have you considered that different patterns in dating can be related to misogynistic attitudes that disadvantage women. I am currently reading a lot of literature on online dating for my thesis, and while you are right that women (in general) are more selective rendering men less popular on such sites , there are a number of explanations for this which do not amount the women having privilege at all. Guys don't have to worry as much about the threat of violence when they arrange to meet women, and when it comes to having sex with lots of people, they are far less likely to be judged (in fact, it is likely they will be praised for doing so).  gt;being able to systematically meet someone of a higher social class What's to say that it is not men driving this trend by failing to see women as full people and dating people based on nothing more than looks. Why is it assumed that women seek partners that are a higher social class when this could be the result of men not being interested in how successful a women is in education and class (or worse yet, not being comfortable being in a relationship with a woman with higher status). Furthermore, there is also the issue of men in general have great economic power and privilege rendering them less depednant/concerned about stability that could be offered by a partner.  gt;a man does not usually judge a woman for working on the minimum wage Perhaps because so many only value women based on looks. This is hardly evidence that men are egalitarian on such issues.  gt; Women do not want to give up the privileges of dating. if society stopped slut shaming women, dealt with rape culture and the threat of violence, addressed pay inequalities (and links to assumptions about childcare), and valued women on more than just looks, we just may well see a shift in gendered desires and motives around dating. The things women have to negotiate when it comes to dating do not amount to privilege *at all*.</TEXT>

The UK is fairly expensive but Nordic countries and places like Switzerland are a lot more expensive. I very much doubt it would be possible to get married in Switzerland for under $20,000. I know a few people in the UK who have done weddings on the cheap for the amount you paid but that would not be possible in a place like the mountains because our national parks few small and few and far between so they are very high in demand. Also, the weather here is often crap so we are more dependant on venues. It can be done but for that price, you would be talking a cold buffet or perhaps a BBQ... certainly not a sit down meal and an open bar for hundreds of guests. My cousin got married in a pretty shit venue in one of the cheaper parts of the UK and her wedding cost $20,000 because of drinks and food .</TEXT>

    <TEXT>But in many places, nobody is forcing every woman who is able to get pregnant to carry and give birth to a baby. There is still a degree of choice. I know plenty of women who could have had children but chose not to (some who got pregnant but had termination). I don't see why i as a gay man who does not want kids should be forced into military service because most heterosexual women are monogamous and want kids. That's not my concern. Personally, i would never have a kid biologically anyway because of environmental concerns. If i do ever have kids, it would be theough adoption. Also, to defend military service (forced) on the basis of choices made by the heterosexual majority is incredibly heteronromative. Sexual minority men shouldn't be forced to do military service because the heterosexual majority are more likely to have biological kids. Also, aside from organising society according heterosexual norms, it's also really crappy for the many heterosexual couples that do no want kids. Military services shouldn't be organised around the expectation that women will have kids. Edit: to go back to your earlier comment, i do not consider having kids of military service to be duties to my countries. I could say that my decision not to have a biological child is my duty to my country given climate change and overpopulation. I don't because i think people should be able to freely choose whether they want kids but i object to the idea that having kids is a duty. I also dont think military service is a duty because i think it's an oppressive institution. As such, i would not choose to work for them.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Its nothing to do with being a mind reader. If you live with someone who is on a tight budget, it becomes fairly evident that they are on a tight budget whenever you try to do/buy anything together. Also, if they live together, they are most likely aware of how much each other earns and cost of shared bills etc. It doesn't take much deductive reasoning to work out whether splitting a food bill 50/50 when your consuming most of it is fair. Maybe the reason she is not communicating it is because she has a partner that just isn't that attentive to her needs, which is hardly grounds for good communication. I do think that she does need to communicate better *but* i also think this is something that shouldn't have to be said, so I disagree that she is more of an arshole.</TEXT>

I'd say one is empowering for everyone because of consent while the other is only empowering for the creepy sex pest.

They were just saying that in a society where women are expected to have kids, men may be expected to serve, which could be seen as separate but equal . However, they said they disagree with those expectations, which i agree with because not all women want to have kids, and even if they do, they may just want to adopt. Also, men that dont want to have kids shouldn't have kids to serve to balance choices those that do make. And then what about trans men who are men but also may have kids. I think to be truly equal nobody should be forced to do any of it.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I get you, although unless women were being forced to have children under this scenario, I still don't consider this separate but equal because of the lack of choice and autonomy in forcing men to do military service. There are plenty of extra responsibilities men, women and enbies who *choose* to have kids could take on the lessen the burden of their pregnant partner. I feel that when it comes to balancing things out, the focus should be on the non-pregnant partner taking on extra so at home and at work to assist their pregnant partner during pregnancy so that the two of them can raise a child. This would then fit with both partners raising a kid for the good of society, and it would still be a choice. Edit: I also think that in a society which truly believed that having kids was some kind of greater good, maternity and paternity pay would be much better.</TEXT>

    <TEXT> gt;In the reading you speak of, do you have any empirical evidence to back up this claim? (That preferably doesn't come from self-reported "studies" done by feminist groups or gender studies folk.) You shouldn't even need to studies to get this. Just look at the body language of women when strangers approach/bother them in bars and night clubs and that compare that to the body language as men. You could make your own survey and go around asking people but I don't think self-reports are necessary because it's pretty visible without even asking .There are also plenty of stats around the disproportionate level of violence women face from partners, so that is of course going to contribute to them perceiving men as a greater threat because men *are* a greater threat to women. You mention being afraid of other men and feeling you have to protect women but that is from other men. You said yourself that you wouldn't worry about violence from a date but you would from men around you. You're are worried about violence from men just like many women. Perhaps if you were dating men, you would be more on guard, especially give that the threat of violence would not necessarily be in an open public space like a bar but at home.</TEXT>

    <TEXT> gt;Balancing childcare (e.g. woman gives birth and man does then stay at home with the baby for a few months) would be great but I don't see a lot of couples doing that unfortunately This is true but I don't think couples that don't have kids should be held accountable for dynamics of those that do, not least because it's heteronormative but also because plenty of couples do navigate this stuff. I know a couple of stay at home dads who stayed at home - on because the father wanted to but the mother didn't and the other because of a practical decision made because the other earns a lot more. I don't think decisions of primarily hetero couples should be used as framework for organising gender in other areas of life, especially not through forced labour.  gt;But obviously as feminists we should work towards a world where that is the case and abolish the military draft. Definitely.  gt;Also thank you very much for understanding my point, it seems you are the only one :D No problem. I didnt at first to be honest but after speaking to you more about it, I could see where you were coming from. It just goes to show that it's good to talk stuff through without jumping to conclusions. The first draft of my initial comment was actually a little antagonistic but I'm glad redrafted it because we wouldn't have had this discussion otherwise, and my assumptions would have been wrong :-).  gt;I think society expects people to do a lot of things without paying them. It used to be really important for society that people are religious and go to church every Sunday for example, but that also didn't pay. People were just shamed if they didn't. Societal constructs aren't only upheld by money. That is true. I guess my comment about money was more about the hypocrisy of a society that says something is important but does nothing to support people doing it. I guess my comment to those that believe that people should have kids would be for it to put their money where their mouth is because if they are not willing to pay for this stuff, it's questionable as to whether they actually care about any greater good of society to begin with. After all, having kids that will grow up to contribute to society costs lots of money. Maternity/paternity pay, education and healthcare all matter, but somehow those spewing these nonsense expectations don't care about those things. I remember reading something recently about pro-lifers that said they they are not pro-life, they are pro birth, because if they actually cared about life they would support policies that actually give kids more of a chance in life.</TEXT>

    <TEXT> gt;I wrote I worry about violence from other men and women. Not just men. But then you said you wouldn't be worried about violence from a date, so clearly your concern about violence from women is not as great. Also, I'm curious as to why you worry about violence from other women when you are on a date but not from the woman you are dating, given that in both circumstances it is common to not know much about anyone in these scenarios. Edit: also, I didn't day men don't face/worry about the threat of violence, I said they don't face/worry about is *as much*. That said, I take your point about male on male violence, which is valid, common and often just as extreme. However, this violence is nothing to do with with women, so is it is unlikely to impact heterosexual dating. Edit 2: when it comes to thinking about the threat between genders rather than within any given gender, which is an important distinction for evaluating hetero dating patterns, men face less violence and the violence they do face is on the whole less extreme. Men have far less to be on guard about when it comes to dating women than women dating men (not as individuals but on the whole, which is what we need to be looking at when considering statistical differences in dating patterns).</TEXT>

    <TEXT> gt;a man is made very uncomfortable by this possibility he could suggest going Dutch This! I guess an issue that may arise if nothing is discussed beforehand is that it may be expected last minute, but then he still has the option to not pay for her half or pay it and never see her again. As a gay man, I have little experience of any of this though. Going dutch in my experience has always been the default and never something I've had to discuss. I've never been in a situation where anyone was expected to pay for anyone. One guy did once pay for me but only because the place he suggested was expensive and I asked to go somewhere else. I think that if the location is surprise, the person asking should pay by default (or at least offer) because there is every chance the person asked can't afford it but if two people pick a place together, any issue around cost should be discussed beforehand and nobody should be expecting anything. Personally, if someone arrived for a date in a place we had agreed on with no intention/means of contributing, that would be red flag to me. I would probably end up paying for it if I was the the one who asked them out but id have no interest in seeing them again. However, I'm not sure how common this actually is because the women I know certainly don't expect it.</TEXT>

    <TEXT> gt;That's precisely why I'm asking for empirical evidence Just google it. As a man myself, I'm astounded that you can't see why women may be more on guard around men than men around women (in general). Women are actually less of physical threat to men, not least because of average physical differences making it harder for many women to tackle attackers but also because women commit far less violence against men, and the violence they do commit is less extreme. It stands to reason that women have more to worry about because far more men are threat.  gt;Now you're switching it up to "violence from a date". I thought the date bit was implied by the fact that I was responded to comments about tinder dating.  gt;You're only concerned with violence when the victims are women, you fail to consider other perspectives. This is what I mean about feminist studies not interested in truth--you just want to advance your preconceptions. As a man who has actually faced violence from men and women, I can assure you I do not just care about women. However, despite my experience, I am not so on guard around women because for the most part, I'm much bigger than most women and I know that what I experienced is not as common. I'm actually more onguard around men, like women, because men are the bigger threat.  gt;On the other hand, there were 4 incidents caused by drunk entitled women all involving assault. (Pulling my girlfriend's hair, shoving me hard out of the way with their hips, etc.). You see, here in Europe this kind of behaviour is far more common amongst men in my experience. However, putting that aside and running with this for a second, I don't see why incidents involving drunken women being violent on a night out would make you afraid to meet women for date because that kind of violence is often dealt with in a public place. When it comes to dating, the types or violence men are more likely to commit against women matters. That doesn't mean that lots of men don't, like women, put up a guard when arranging dates with women because of traumatic experiences and fear of being murdered or raped by an intimate partner but it does make such worries statistically less likely and less strong, which of course is going to result in some gender disparities in how people navigate the dating world.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I agree to an extent but I'm reluctant to say they are an arsehole big time given that the OP is clearly trying to navigate a complex relationship with his mother and avoid anything that may trigger her issues with drugs and alcohol. They do need to deal with this but as someone who has grown up with a mother with similar problems, knowing how to approach such scenarios can be excruciatingly difficult and psychologically challenging. For me personally, even challenging my mum on fairly basic everyday stuff has taken a lot of building up to, sometimes even at the detriment of my own mental health, so I can empathise with the OP *a lot*.</TEXT>

It's not fair but i knew that it is my mum who will go off the rails when i haven't because like the OPs mum, she is not psychologically stable.

    <TEXT>I mean, a lack of willingness implies that this is nothing but a choice. I've put my mother before my bf before because I've been worried about what my mum might do. The idea of choice is like saying, well you could choose to put your bf first and let your mum jump off cliff. This is obviously an extreme example but i have been in plenty of situations where I've been afraid to approach things because this has felt like a real possibility and been a legitimate fear. These kinds of relationships can really limit rational judgment, and if the OP is unable to approach the situation rationally because of very legitimate fears and concerns affecting judgment, his choice are going to be limited .  gt;and blaming his gf for not being happy being the issue, that led me to my judgment Yes, this is wrong. Understandble perhaps because we often try to justify what seem like impossible situations we find ourselves in, but this is wrong. Like i said, i agree that he needs to address his gfs concerns. I guess i am just a little biased because i can really empathise with having a mother like this. It's difficult to manage and support them one on one, nevermind navigating a life outside of that. I do really feel for the OP *but* i think he needs to find away because if it gets in the way of other relationships, that's not healthy for him or his mother.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Thanks. I do agree with you, and i have had actually to work through this a great deal. I'm now much better at setting boundaries for my mother but it took time and was very difficult,mainly because i worried about her (and she gave me good reason to). I guess when you grow up in a household where you are forced to deal with a parents mental health problems from a young age (a parent which either does not or in some cases cannot respect boundaries), it can become quote difficult to navigate these relationships in later life. Many of us in this situations have grown up putting our parents before ourselves so its not surprise that we end up putting them before our partners. My response was not to defend the the OP but rather to question whether he is an arehole because i feel this scenario, which rightfully infuriating for his gf, is very complicated. It needs to be addressed but at the same time, a little tension and pushback *in the beginning* is perhaps normal and understandable for someone having to navigate such complex relationships.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>And of course she is not being unreasonable. He is wrong in that regard. However, having been in his shoes, i can understand a little pushback and defensiveness because he is navigating a very difficult relationship with his mother and addressing that could end up creating tension with her. Him saying everything is fine and reasonable is at the same time him saying he doesn't want to fuck up his relationship with his mother and/or send his mother off the rails and then *feel* responsible for that (especially if he has grown up with a dependant mother). All of this is going to make him defensive and irrational, which i think is massively understandable. I think this is perhaps something which is harder to grasp for those who haven't undergone the psychological trauma of having an unstable dependant parent. *I do* think that the OP needs to address this and that he is wrong thinking his gf is unreasonable *but* i understand why he would genuinely believe she is unreasonable because admitting anything different is probably difficult (perhaps even terrifying) on a subconscious level. I think this is an irrational defence mechanism because of very complex relationships. There may well be psychological constraints on his ability to think rationally because of past experiences so im reluctant to call him an arehole but i would say this is unhealthy and needs to be addressed for his gf but also for himself. Therapy could help.</TEXT>

    <TEXT> gt;In addition to the great cost to his own mental well being This is exactly why i think he needs to address this, even if that means therapy. It is unhealthy for everyone around  gt;Like, OP, this kinda made him an asshole. I can't speak for your relationship but based on the info i have from the OP, im not sure if i would consider him arsehole because this is a mental health problem. Like any mental health problem, addiction etc, it can be difficult to think rationally and admit there is problem. It is common to make be defensive and make out as if the problem is located elsewhere when you feel like your entire world is going to fall apart if you don't. This isn't necessarily a rational response but rather a subconscious defence mechanism. When people do this, they are unaware they are doing it and truly believe they don't have a problem. That is a sickness and not an arsehole move in my books because being an arehole requires more conscious intent. Perhaps im biased as someone who still has a relationship with an unstable parent. I have learnt to navigate it but it took time. I don't think i was ever an arehole for putting my mum first, i was psychologically damaged by growing up with her so dependant on me, so it took time to work out. I think i would have become an arehole had i not addressed it but a few roadblocks along the way are totally normal when navigating a relationship like that. For me to say the OP is arehole, i would want to know a) how long this have been creating tension and b) now that he has had advice from lots of people here, is he willing to try and address the issue.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Sorry, i hope i didn't come across as if i was dismissing your comment. I actually do agree, it is really valuable info because i think all of us in some way or another have struggled with boundaries, particularly when it comes to people we are close to. I think the OP is perhaps struggling to see the boundaries being overstepped because of his love for his mum and fears about what addressing the issue might do to her. While i think it is understandable, it is also irrational because of his closeness with his mum. His gf as somewhat of an outsider is in a position where she is able to see things more clearly and rationally, but getting him to realise that may take a bit of work. Hopefully some of the comments on here will push him to address it. Like you, i did and it actually made me a lot happier in myself and a lot of the things i feared would happen didn't. My mum wasn't happy with some of the things i said to her but she got over it and actually doesnt push as hard anymore.</TEXT>

    <TITLE>Is it ok to ironically victim blame male rape survivors to point out double standards?</TITLE>
    <DATE>2020-01-06 16:30:48</DATE>
    <TEXT>I have come here to ask this after following a Guardian news article on a serial rapist that raped dozens of men. Lots of the Facebook comments were saying things like "what was he wearing?" to rightfully point out the kind of crap women have to deal with but i just felt like this was insensitive and not the time or the place. I've seen lots of satirical videos joking about these double standards, which i think can be a great way of exposing/mocking hypocrisy but i just felt like it was wrong to post this on such an article given that the victims and their families could see it. I'm not sure whether using actual victims as a vessel to promote this stuff is right. I know that women have to face this stuff all the time but I don't think it is at all helpful to balance things out by sayings things that harm male victims. It feels somewhat like a race to the bottom. https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2020/jan/06/reynhard-sinaga-jailed-life-drugging-raping-men-manchester?CMP=fb_gu amp;utm_medium=Social amp;utm_source=Facebook#Echobox=1578313724 Edit: as someone pointed out, there is no comments on that link.

    <TEXT> gt;In my own journey towards good mental health, I have to acknowledge that there are "reasons" for many things. These reasons are not "excuses". Despite, or more accurately, because of my own history of mental illness, I have to take and accept responsibility for the things I have done and the people I have hurt. My actions may have been understandable, but they were still wrong, and many times, I was still an asshole. Now that you've said this id probably say im half way on the issue only because while i do agree that we need to take individual responsibility, with mental health there is a tendency to emphasise individual factors and ignore wider social, material and culturel constraints on wellbeing. Some or us have to battle things others never have to, so the responsibility for the problem kind of lies between the individual and society. That said, if he wants to keep his gf, blaming other factors isn't going to help and it is only through taking responsibility that he is going to fix this. Those wide factors enable me to empathise with his experience but if he wants what is best for himself and others, he needs to address those issues.  gt;I guess I kinda disagree with you. I don't think that anyone "intends" to be an asshole. If people were only assholes when they wanted to be, there wouldn't be a need for this sub. Yes, good point, although this particularly blind spot could run particularly deep, which is why im reluctant to label him an arsehole</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Thanks for this. I hadn't even thought about all the other problematic stuff that is often said to male victims. You just got me thinking about how when the woman is a perpetrator, it is often assumed that the man wanted, racially if he had an erection. Hadn't even thought about people assuming they are gay (and I'm gay myself). On the other side of the coin, if the accused is gay, I can imagine some people taking male victims of men more seriously not because the victim has male privilege but because they are homophobic and assume that all gay men are capable of this kind of thing.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I think in some ways for sure, although as a gay man I do consider myself privileged when it comes to issues surrounding sexual violence and assault just because of how pervasive it is for women. While there is a lot of normalising harassment within the gay community, I've never felt afraid or anything. I think the power dynamics are often (but definitely not always) more equal. That said, if I was a male survivor I'm sure i'd feel differently.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Yes sure, no problem at all. On the gay scene, especially in gay clubs, touching without consent is very common and often even embraced. It is really common for gay men to grab strangers arses or grind up against them as means of expressing interest and it often works because so many are doing it one another. It's really shit for those that don't want to be involved in that but there are enough that do it to normalise it if that makes sense. The point at which a lot of gay men consider something harassment/assault is very different. From my own experience (as someone on the receiving end of this), I think there are some differences between dynamics between men and women. For example, I don't like it when this happens but comparing my experience to stuff i've witnessed around female friends, i feel that gay men are less persistent. Whenever this has happened, i've told them to to  #8226; #8226; #8226; #8226; off and it has always worked, which is definitely not the case when I see this shit go down in straight clubs. I think this why, despite not liking it when this happens, I have never felt threatened. Also, because of how engrained it is in the culture, they just move on to someone else until they find someone interested (and there will often be someone who is). As for why, I think that it is probably rooted in a few things. I think that it most definitely linked to hegemonic masculine attitudes towards sex. However, because of the more equal power dynamics between gay men than between men and women, I don't think a lot of men feel particularly threatened by it so they just let it slide, even if they are not participating in this kind of behaviour. I think the other thing it may be linked to is the history of men having sex with men, which was very much non-verbal and in many cases just about sex because it had to be hidden. As for your last question, it is starting to be addressed a lot more, particularly in the wake of #metoo actually. Younger queer men grow up in a culture where consent is being discussed and they are bring that to queer spaces. I think there are some spaces that are a long way off but from my experience, it happens a lot less in bars and clubs than it used to. I hope this is all useful. If you are interested in learning more, i can try and dig out some blog articles I've read on it tomorrow.</TEXT>

To be fair, the responses on here have been great, which i thought they would be, but just wanted to clarify because the comment i was responding to on pinknews was getting a fair amount of likes and laughs.

    <TEXT> gt;Don #8217;t porn actresses (even independent ones) face market pressure to do more and more extreme things to make money? It doesn #8217;t seem like they #8217;re actually in control, the consumer is. Speaking as gay man that once did porn, yes, but I always negotiated this with stuff i already enjoyed doing. I never did anything i was uncomfortable with. I did a few things that i wasn't completely into but as an independent actor, I was never forced to do it and i wasn't bothered by doing it. It terms of power and exploitation, my argument would be that any work is exploitative. I sold my body in accordance with market demands for money but the alternative was to sell my body as labour in accordance with market demands. When i say i was empowered by porn, I'm not saying that i had complete free will to produce anything i wanted for reasons you started *but* I felt more empowered than inwipd have done selling my body as labour for minimum wage. Within current global capitalist context, it was most enpowering option I had at the time. I could have survived on minimum wage because i had no debts or people dependant on me and at the time, i lived in a fairly cheap area, but i didn't want to just survive. Earning more and working less on the whole made me feel more free. Also, it's changed a lot now but i feel that for a long time, the debate around porn has been very heteronormative. There is a long history of gay porn being positive for representation because it was one of the few places queer men could get validation in a society where non-heterosexual sex was absent. Also, a lot of queer men have relied on porn because they have not felt comfortable hooking up/dating in real life because of their marginalised sexual status. The gay porn industry is far from ideal but it has been useful in some ways.</TEXT>

    <TEXT> gt;In fact, I actually find the most compelling feminist criticism of various religions/denominations comes from women who are part of those communities -- which makes sense, given that they tend to have insider information that atheists wouldn't have. Just to piggy back on this, i read a really good article criticising homophobia in the church recently and one of the things it problematised was the way in which atheist feminist and queer activists deal with it. I wish i could find it again to share but essentially, it argued that that a lot of atheists end up reinforcing problematic doctrine because like the conservatives interpreting religious texts, their argument against religion rests on those same interpretation. They will say things like, the Bible is wrong because it says being gay is wrong, which reinforces the idea that the Bible says this for all that follow, whereas queer theologians will deconstruct those interpretations and offer alternative translations which open up religion so that people can negotiate religious and non-normative sexual identities.</TEXT>

My work involves building on existing, not just looking at data through theory that already exists but also considering what the theory is unable to tell me about the data and come of up with new ways of understanding gender dynamics to account for what I find. I also teach on a generic sociology module which includes a couple of lectures and a seminar on feminism, so I have take somewhat of a lead in teaching feminism, although I do always try to make my lessons as participatory as possible so that the students I teach (who are primarily women) have a chance to challenge ideas and voice their own perspectives. Edit: I should also mention that I teach standpoint theory, which acknowledges gaps in knowledge resulting from my position and experience as a man, so while I may discuss issues concerning women in my classes, I frame that discussion as my insights from theory and research as an outsider, which allows my students to bring in personal narratives that sometimes fit, challenge or expand upon my understanding</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I mean, this is victim blaming because these men can't change the fact they got drunk, nor is blaming them going to stop people getting drunk. The most effective means of stopping this from happening is through focusing on the rapist himself because even when people do try to play it safe, predators find a way. It's like when women get raped walking home and people say, why didn't they get a taxi? This completely ignores the fact that sexual assault often happens in taxis. I know people who walk home alone because they feel it is safer because of bad experiences in cabs. Not just that, most rape and sexual assault doesn't even happen with strangers. You might like to think that this kind of thing could be avoided but even if these men hadn't have been drunk, there would have been others that were. The rapist would have found people regardless. And even in a hypothetical world where nobody is ever shit faced, someone like this could still find ways of drugging people</TEXT>

    <TEXT>How is that derailing? I stated facts. The most prolific rapist is a man, which is shit for men and something men *should* be concerned about. As a man who is could be attacked by men like this, I feel that feminism offers the best solutions at addressing the problem because feminism deconstructs rape culture and takes victims claims seriously. All of this is good for these male rapists. I don't see how blaming feminism helps these victims at all. What I see here is the fact that when feminists say men pose a disproportionate threat when it comes to sexual of violence, they are right and that by agreeing with them, i myself as a man can work towards reducing the risk of men like this ever raping me. However, if you have any insights as to why a man raping loads of men is women's fault, please enlighten me.</TEXT>

    <TEXT> gt; No ones attacking feminism here, the fact you assume that shows alot. Talking about how bad white men have it is attacking feminism. I ne #8217;er made this about men having better or worse, you did. As for it being men #8217;s fault, it is obviously not the victims ms fault but the rapist is man. Most rapists are men. That is a fact, and acknowledging that fact is important for male victims of those men. Men and women who are not rapists should be united against those that are, which includes female rapists but there is no ignoring the fact that most rapists are men. Your failure to acknowledge the importance of that leads me to think that you don #8217;t actually care about addressing the problem for Male victims, which, as a man who is at risk of men like this, I find concerning. I never stated the stats. It may well be that men are just as likely to be raped as women. I never stated anything otherwise. However, if we want to help male victims and reduce the risk of this happening to them, we need to focus on who is doing the raping and that is men. These are not the same men as the male victims. As I said, I am man myself so I have a personal investment in doing something to challenge the men that are the problem.  gt; Yes by twisting from focusing on the men attacked to the men doing the attacking you derail If the goal is to reduce the number of male rape victims, who do you suggest we focus on because I fail to see any solution other than focusing on those that commit these crimes. Again, provide me with a solution on how best to reduce the number of male rapists that are threat to both men and women without identifying the characteristics of the perpetrators and the i will listen.</TEXT>

    <TEXT> gt; Funny in a sense? Yes. The idea of saying this kind of thing to any victim makes me feel a bit sick tbh. Perhaps if I had experienced assault I would feel differently but I #8217;d like to think it would give me more empathy for those that had. Obviously, these posts are not directly targeting victims but it is not a stretch to think that victims and their families may be following the news coverage. As others have mentioned, women have to deal with this all the time but men do face their own struggles around rape in relation to homophobia surrounding men raping men rape and erasure surrounding women raping men because a lot of people assume that straight men can #8217;t be raped. Men may not get asked what they were wearing but they are exposed to different means of downplaying and undermining their experience, which, like women, results in many not coming forward brought deeply engrained shame and fear that they won #8217;t be taken seriously, given how shit things are for rape survivors in general, I don #8217;t think these posts cause more harm than good. Edit: I #8217;m not saying that the prepped posting this stuff are at all as bad as those from people who actually victim blame because from what I #8217;ve seen, they are actually form people that support victims.

    <TEXT>I think that #8217;s a good point because it calls out the double standard but still shows respect for the victim and advocates for better justice for all. That said, I think It is worth mentioning that on the articles I #8217;ve read, some have been blaming the victims for being drunk so victim blaming was happening, even if it wasn #8217;t to the same degree. Also, If it had been a female perpetrator, the comments would have been different because lots of people still like to think that women can #8217;t rape men . I think there are also some problems with comparing cases of men raping men with men raping women because there are many powerful people that may take men raping men more seriously not necessarily just because of misogyny but because of fears rooted in homophobia. In fact, the fact that many men don #8217;t take male victims of women seriously would suggest to me that the reason cases like this are taken so seriously is more because of homophobia. In a case like this where the perpetrator was gay, they may be more likely to assume guilt just based on the assumption that gay men are predators. I think there are double standards all around which operate in different ways to make victims feel ashamed and afraid to come out. I think that whatever people do to address double standards, the barriers for any victim needs to come first.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>As another northern male, i find this discussion quite interesting because of intersections of class. The word love (or duck depending on location) are very much ingrained in class in the north, and it really isn't gendered in the context the OP described. Men also call men love. That said, tone and context are massively important. While in my hometown, i would not be surprised if a cashier in a supermarket called me love (irrespective of gender), there are contexts where it is used patronisingly. My mum is a working class woman and a feminist and also wouldn't mind because for her, this is a part of working-classness (middle class people in the north don't use these words because the way in which they perform politeness is more distant and less familiar). That said, there are times when she has been offended and its always down to tone. If for example she was making a complaint in a store and someone said 'look love' in a patronising way to undermine her complaint, she would get angry. However, i feel that middle class people and people from less working class areas often fail to read these nuances.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>So as another northern working class male, I think you are right in identifying the context in which you used it isn't gendered because men even call other men love (or duck depending on the region) in such settings. Similarly, in South Wales, people call each other beaut. I think these terms of endearment are very much a working class thing and are primarily used in working class post industrial areas with strong histories of community and close social ties rendering what some people consider overfamiliarity just normal polite everyday interaction. I do think a discussion of the nuances of how these words are used is important from an intersection feminist point of view because they are so classed and as you say, not gendered. That said, i think it is important to note that they can still be used in a gendered way. For example, my mum is a working class feminist who has no issue with men or women calling her love, and she calls everyone love herself. However, there have been times when she has been angry at being called love and it has always come down to tone and context. She would have no issue with being called love by a cashier in tesco but if she is making a complaint and someone said 'look love' she would be angry. I feel that when it comes to love being used in a patronising way, it is gendered because men are more likely to use it this way when speaking to women. However, I also think that in this context, love becomes less of a working class thing. I feel that men that would not ordinarily call people love do so when they want to patronise women in such contexts.</TEXT>

People can be an arsehole accidently. As for whether or not sex was his goal, I'm struggling to see what could be the goal from sulking after someone says no. I think the question of what he would have done if she had said yes after that needs to be taken seriously not just for her but for him because those kinds of actions often result in sexual corrosion and could land him in a lot of trouble. I don't think going easy on him is particularly useful for the OP or her husband.

    <TEXT> gt;The sulking could not be about the sex exactly, it could be a bad day. Whatever other things he had going on that day, she said she didn't want to sex, he responded by asking for sex *again*, she said no *again*, and then started to sulk directly after in response to her saying no twice. Had she had sex with him after his 2nd request, he would not have been sulking about her not having sex so the sulking is absolutely about her saying no to sex. Not just that but her failure to give into his sulking (another no to sex) was met with anger (shouting) and entitlement (telling her that she couldn't sleep in the same bed because she wouldn't have sex with him). None of this is ok but the last part is particularly bad. How many no's does she have to give? His response was completely unacceptable no matter what else was going on his life. People who do arsehole things are not inherently bad people. Most arehole moves, even some of the most a abhorent crimes people commit, can be linked back to other things that are going on or have gone on in people's lives but when that baggage results in responses to social situations that hurt others or put them in uncomfortable coercive situations, the person has to own that baggage, acknowledge they were an arehole and move on. That is how someone who does arehole things can show they are not an arehole person.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>My point is that when we see stats showing that women are more likely to date/marry someone with more money, the focus is on how it is because they are gold diggers. However, these stats *could* be skewed by a) men generally earn more money giving women less opportunities to marry down than men b) men not wanting to date women with higher statuses/saleries and, to bring me on to the point you've highlighted, c) men being more likely to marry down the likely scale because they only care about a women's looks where as women *may* be more likely to marry someone with similar levels of education and status. All of these things taken together would skew the stats that show that women are more likely to marry up. Edit: if someone is with you for nothing but looks, you are not just passive, you are non-existent. Kind of like a blow up doll. I'm a man and i could not imagine being with someone who i didn't find interesting. I'm dating a human, not a robot.

It varies but often this is tied up with some kind of fetish for being dominated and humiliated by the 'cuckqueen'. It's also become more common between men who have sex with men but from what I've, for these men it is more about watching and exhibitionism rather than dominance and humiliation</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Not the OP but I guess an increase in the number of men into being cheated on by their wives/partner? I'm not sure if it is some futile effort to suggest that feminists are to blame for men being into it. From what I've read, it does seem to be on the increase and is starting to become more common even amongst queer men but my guess is that these men were already into being dominated and humiliated and that cuckholding has simly become a more popular means of expressing that (although I'm sure that there a men who would like to believe that this is all about women having too much power, despite the fact that there are still on the whole way more female submissives on the BDSM scene)</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I mean, this particular fetish is definitely generated but then so are other fetishes. On the whole, their are more female submissives. For some reason, this one gets men off. It also seems to have become quite common amongst men who have sex with men. I know a couple of gay men that do this. As for why the increase, my guess would be that male cucks already got off on being dominated and humiliated by women and that as cuckoldong has become more visible on the internet and on the BDSM scene, it has become a new avenue in which they explore this.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>It's not something I'm into but i know people that are. As i posted elsewhere, i agree that there has been an increase but i think it's just a case of people who are already into being dominated and humiliated becoming aware of it and using cuckolding as another avenue for exploring that. It is gendered (i.e. there are more male cucks) but then so are lots of fetishes. On the whole, there are still way more female submissives so if this post is some futile effort to make it look like women have too much power, it fails. As for why it's gendered, my guess is that the idea of woman cheating is more humiliating because men are socialised into feeling entitled to women. This is all just speculation but I definitely don't think feminism is at all responsible for the increase.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I'm not just going by what is visible online. There have been studies done on this. I dont have any to hand but I'm sure you kind find data on google. Similarly, when it comes to gay men, there are more submissive gay men to dominant gay men. These things are rarely balanced. Anyway, as per your question as why the increase, as i said, it could just be that all of these new male cucks were already into being dominated and humiliated and that as cuckolding has become more visible on the BDSM scene and in porn, these men have started to use cuckolding a means of exploring those desires. Even if there were equal numbers of male and female submissives overall, this could still stand because not every sexual practice is enjoyed equally by both genders. Take foot fetishes for example, women can have them but it is more common for men to have them. And then there are people with rape fantasies. When it comes to exploring those fetishes, it is almost always men that play the dominant role. Edit: here is an article about one study but there are plenty more. There are even studies on actual BDSM clubs etc. I don't see why female dominants would be that less likely to be active online. There may be less female BDSM practitioners looking for sex online but there is no reason to assume that this would have such a significant impact on on the ratio of doms to subs. We can still calculate what % of such women are dom and sub and compare that to the % of men that adopt these roles. https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/blog/unique-everybody-else/201502/personality-traits-bdsm-practitioners-another-look?amp</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Of course this study is only representative of reddit and isn #8217;t representative of the general population or any other bdsm community online. However, studies on other online communities have demonstrated a similar pattern. The fact that there has been a lower % of female doms in pretty much all of the literature I #8217;ve read on online spaces is still very interesting because I can #8217;t think of any reason why there would be any less female doms online when female submissive are active. That said, if you have any information on why female doms may be less likely to be active online *when* female submissive are so active online, I #8217;d be really interested in hearing it. Also, if you have any data that shows female doms are more common offline, again, please share. I acknowledge that a lot of the data we have is limited but it #8217;s all we have and I am yet to see anything on any space (whether that be offline or online) that backs up what you are saying about there being equal proportions of female/ male doms. The assertions I #8217;ve made about why there is an increase are speculations because there is no data on the increase in cuckolding. However, I do have a background in social science and psychology and I specialise in sex, and I feel these are speculations are worthy of investigation and consideration. I #8217;m not going to be able to prove them because I #8217;m not about to conduct a study in response to a reddit post. The one thing I can say for sure is that an increase in cuckolding does not necessary mean there has been an increase in people wanting to be humiliated and dominated by their wives. If someone is into being humiliated, the ways in which they may fulfill that desire may can change as they see or hear about things they hadn #8217;t really thought about before. Cuckolding has become more visible within the BDSM community, so it is definitely possible that the increase in cucks is related to people who were already kinky looking for a new outlets to explore masochist desires they already had as they #8217;ve become bored of other things they do to fulfill those desires. That is not an unreasonable speculation.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>That's cool, don't worry. I think understanding and awareness on both sides is useful here. A lot of feminist discourse on this doesn't always consider region and class differences in language. Like most activism, discussions around language tend to focus on middle-class understandings and sensibilities. I did read one feminist blog post that explored this particular issue though. I'll see if i can dig it out and post on here. Since going to uni in the south, I've ended up modifying my language a lot to conform to middle class ways of doing things to fit in, and i dont think that is a good thing so i think these kinds of discussions are important to have. However, as it stands, people aren't really thinking about it so i would say it's best to play it safe with people who are unlikely to understand or know about the nuances of how these words are used.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Ok, so there is no research to back up your assumption at all. The research I #8217;ve mention is limited but it is all we have. Given that there is absolutely no reason I can think of as to why female doms would be less active online *when* female subs are, I stand by my initial claim. Research is never perfect so we have to make assumptions with what we #8217;ve got.  gt; Also I never said that there were as many female doms as male doms. I said there were as many female subs as male subs. Ok, so perhaps there has been some miscommunication. The research I #8217;ve read suggests that women are less like to be dom (and by extension more likely to be sub). However, in terms of the absolute numbers of female subs versus subs, I have no idea.  gt; One obvious reason there might be less female doms online is that our sexist society finds female dominance very hard to deal with - it is repressed rather than respected. It #8217;s understandable that female doms might be more private. On the flip side, our patriarchal society champions female submission. This is a fair point. However, as someone actively involved in the BDSM scene, these assumptions are far less strong on that scene compared to the wider society because it is very open sexual culture. Despite the imbalance I #8217;ve spoke about, there are still great deal of men looking female doms so being a woman and a dom is very much normalised on the scene. I #8217;ve never seen anyone on the scene question why a woman is dominant, even though many outside that scene do. On the BDSM scene, female doms are normal and expected. Also, within popular culture, I feel that a lot of representations of BDSM focus on the figure of the dominitrax, which is very different to the way vanilla sex is representated in which it is usually men that are more dominant. Not just that, even if the assumptions about female dominance did make female doms more private, a lot of fetish accounts make use of anonymity for obvious reasons anyway, which gives them that privacy. Also, if you actually visit a site like fetlife, you will see that the submissive profiles contain way more stigmatising information that people would want to keep private. A profile from a female dominant saying she wants to humiliate guys is nowhere near as stigmatised by wider society as someone who wanted to be urinated on. In my experience, people disclose a lot of stigmatising information on this site, especially subs. That said, I do think you have a point about repression because of wider societal attitudes toward sex and power. I don #8217;t for one second think that the imbalance reflected is natural or biological. I think that there is the potential to have as many female doms as male doms but societal expectations make that less so. Societal expectation are internalised. They don #8217;t just stop us from being public about ours desires, they actually impact our desires. The societal expectations you mention are actually used in lots of the literature to explain why there is less female doms.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I'll try find it:-).  gt;And I totally agree about the centralisation of activism around the middle class I never really used to notice it but i think it's big reason why so many working class relatives i know have switched off on a lot of identity politics. I'm not someone who believe we just need class politics without identity politics or anything but i think class needs be talked about more in discussions around identity and language. From my experience as a gay man, it's not just white working class men that are resistant to a lot of social justice activism. I know plenty of working class women and working class LGBTQ people who are the same. Even my mum who i mentioned is a feminist gets frustrated by the failure for a lot of feminism to think through class. That said, this sub is great. There is a massive difference between mainstream feminism and actual feminism but unfortunately, a lot of people on see the mainstream.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Ok thanks, this has definitely given me a lot to think about. I guess the main question i would have in responsive to the study you sit is that it doesn't measure preferred roles. I'm definitely a sub but of i was asked if I'd ever fantasies about being dominant, the answer would definitely be yes. There are a lot of switches and people the identify as dom and sub but can still get of on fulfilling the other role. That said, you are right about male subs being sexually entitled, and that could definitely be off putting for female doms, *but* so are male doms, which would be off putting to female subs, so this in itself doesn't convince me that female doms would be any less like to go online than female subs. If anything, when it comes entitled misogynistic men, it is the subs that end in the most vulnerable position. I do take your point about female doms not being as respected on the scene but i stand by my comment about lots of people using the site anonymously and sub profiles containing way more stigmatised information than simply identifying as a woman and a dom.  gt;I 100% agree that if there were a difference it would be socially conditioned. If you can point me towards some good literature  #8216;to explain why there is less female doms #8217; then I am all ears. However, you also say that research suggests that women are less likely to be Dom and  #8216;by extension #8217; more likely to be sub. But that  #8216;by extension #8217; really doesn #8217;t make sense. There isn #8217;t some cosmic balance of Dom and sub. Women can be neither Dom nor sub, therefore even if women are less likely to be Dom it does not follow that they are more likely to be sub. Anyone suggesting that it does, is genuinely talking nonsense. And again, I am not talking about proportion of Doms. Ok, so there seems to be miscommunication here because im speak about proportions within those practicing BDSM, so im not interested in those that are neither dom or sub, or the absolute numbers of men versus women practicing. Im interested on the ratio of doms to sub (preferred role), so when i said by extension there are more subs, i wasn't referring to absolute numbers. For example, if 20 #8453; of female BDSM practioners prefer to be dom, 80% prefer to be sub (i know this is far too simplistic because some are 50/50 and identify as switch). Similarly, if 80% of male BDSM practitioners prefer to dom, there is is only 20% left for subs. Thats what i meant when i said if there are more doms, there are less subs. Sorry, i worded that badly.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Haha no worries. I had the feeling there may have been miscommunication. As for what im counting as practicing BDSM, im referring to those that identify with the label and participate on the the BDSM scene (whether online or offline). For me, as a gay, man, my interests mostly centre around that but I've used sites like fet life and been interested in wider literature around online and offline communities and spaces for meeting people. However, you raise an interesting point about BDSM practices that go on outside of the community and identity. Personally, the community is the place where ive mostly met people with whom i feel able to be open and explore. Those active in some kind of community also make me feel safer as a submissive because this is where a lot of the discussions around consent etc go on. The few encounters ive had with people that are into dominating but no necessarily identify with BDSM culture have unintentionally crossed boundaries because of problematic assumptions about what it means to be a sub. Those encounters have always been very fifty shades of grey. Edit 1: As for studies, i only have the one on Reddit to hand but the ones I've seen over communities show an imbalance towards doms as well, even when switches were taken into account. Every study i i have read in response my specific research question an imbalance towards male doms within bdsm spaces, whether that be online or offline. However, you are right that this excludes the practices of those that practice bdsm but dont identify with the subculture, and it certainly doesn't include those that dont practice. However, the latter group I'm less interested in. 'Vanilla' sex comes with its own set of complicated power dynamics. Also, the % i just provided were made up to show how i was thinking about it proportionally i.e. the ratio of subs to doms in relation to gender in any given space. I think this research is useful because a hell of a lot of people, like myself, rely on these spaces to meet people into BDSM, so the imbalance does matter, even if it is not wholly representative. I know im contradicting myself a bit in this response but that's because i agree with some of the wholes you've identified in my previous comments</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I mean, like any research, it has more use to some than others. To those who only use the community to engage in these practices, this research is not restrictive and is actually really relevant because it captures dynamics they are going to negotiate. However, there are limitations and it doesn't reflect the dynamics for those engaging in practices outside those communities. I think more research is needed to reflect different people. No study will ever be fully generalisable to all practitioners because different contexts can make so much difference. Also, i guess those that dont practice within a community are going to be harder to recruit. I did read one study that randomly selected different people for telephone interviews on sex, which tried to address BDSM in a broader sense. I can't remember if it looked at gender so much though. I will see if i can find it and check it out. If it does, I'll share i with you. Sorry if i came across confrontation. At first i thought you were disputing my claim as an anti-feminist person on the group so i may have got too defensive. It was only after you started to share why you felt gender dynamics may be different online that i realised you weren't. I think it was because of the nature of the post. I think there are men that would like to think that any increase in cuckolding is because of feminists trying to dominate and control men, so when i read your initial critique of my comment, i made assumptions that this is where you were coming from. Its interesting what you say about communities of identity because the same applies to the lgbtq identity, which privileges white affluent men. I guess the issue in this case is that the wider society also privileges men. I do know women who feel that BDSM culture is way more focused on issues around consent ( but this will obviously vary). There was actually a study on consent comparing male BDSM and non-BDSM pactioners (defined in a broader sense by practices rather than identity and involvement in community) attitudes towards consent, and the former scored better than the latter. Come to think of it, it may have been the same random sampled study i mentioned. If it is, i should be able to find it if you are interested?</TEXT>

    <TEXT> gt; yeah, maybe restrictive is the wrong word - I mean that it #8217;s limited and it #8217;s limitations would need to be recognised. You couldn #8217;t use the info to say  #8216;there are more female Doms #8217; (or whatever it proved #8217;) without clarifying that you meant within that community specifically. Ah ok, yes I agree.  gt; And yes, I think I reacted defensively too because the line  #8216;women are more likely to be subs #8217; is so often used by men with a sexist bias and a vested interest in believing that that is true. As with this particular extreme, particularly depressing thread: https://www.reddit.com/r/AskMen/comments/28sjgx/what_percentage_of_women_do_you_think_prefer_to/ Yes, I can why you thought that on reflection, and I think even amongst those pointing to dynamics within communities, there can be a massive tendency to essentialism roles and ignore the fact that just the desires people have and roles they assume are connected to wider social and cultural relations, so even if we could prove that women who engaged in BDSM were more likely to be sub than men engaging in BDSM, this would never be evidence that women are naturally more submissive. I think i read your comment as anti feminist because I #8217;ve read feminist papers in the past that have tried to say there are more female subs in order to criticise power dynamics within BDSM and suggest that it is often women who take on those roles. Just to link you to the articles I mentioned, this is the first one on consent. The same size is small and it is only representative of niche groups but it looks at people within and outside the bdsm community. http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/00224499.2016.1168353 The random sampled telephone surgery actually has a huge sample and large response rate. It isn #8217;t he same article as I thought. It is looking at wellbeing differences between genders. There is some interested stuff around coercion but it is unable to conclude whether this is because of BDSM or great exposure to sexual encounters where coercion is more likely to occur, but it is still interesting . Unfortunately it doesn #8217;t ask for roles, which is a shame because it would have been a really good opportunity to ask about that given that it is looking at practices rather than members of any given community. However, this was interesting.  #8220;Our finding of higher proportions of female BDSM participants relative to male BDSM par- ticipants than has been found in past research may be a reflection of the fact that our data were col- lected from a sample of the general population, rather than from BDSM clubs or other subsamples of the population [20 #8211;21,23,26]. #8221; https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/j.1743-6109.2008.00795.x</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Yes, I should have been clearer about who and what was included in that claim. The study you share ddid still show an imbalance though, which I still find interesting. I don #8217;t think it reflects an essential imbalance but perhaps people conforming to social expectations not necessarily consciously but subconsciously. For example, it also finds that slightly more men than women fantasise about being forced to have sex - but most people associate fantasies of being raped with women. This is true. I think with something like rape, these other narratives of wanting to be forced to have sex need to be told. I only skimmed over that study yesterday but I #8217;ll take another look .</TEXT>

That #8217;s fair  gt;The desire can be wired before actualisation, sure. But if you never want it to happen, that is different to wanting it to happen but being ashamed of actualising it. That #8217;s true. I guess we would need data on why they don #8217;t want it to happen. It may not just be shame but could also be fear of putting themselves in a vulnerable position. I had that as a man so I could imagine that this may be an issue for some women who are more likely to be coerced and assaulted etc. I guess there is also the stigma against women being more sexual and expectation for them to be passive, which I don #8217;t think is necessarily the same as being submissive in a health BDSM scenario because of the sub paradox. As sub acting on their desires is expressing a lot of sexual agency and their ideal partner is someone that will respond to those needs, where as some people may not really act on their on desires so much and just fulfil those of their partners. I think there are things that may explain less women actualising such desires but I #8217;ve never read anything on this so I #8217;m just speculating.

    <TEXT>I mean, we know from wider research that fear and shame do restrict whether people actualise fantasies, and the defects of shame and fear on actualisation are not always equal, as demonstrated by Queer literature. I was saying that shame or fear fed into all of this but that it could for some and that may be more likely amongst certain groups than others because of power relations. However, as I said, this is just speculation to point to the limit of what those stats tell us. I think all of these observed differences can shift and change in relation to the expectations society and culture places on different bodies. As I said, I myself have have or acted on stuff because of shame (sometimes not even aware that shame was the reason until a later date). I know lots of people, especially queer people, that had similar experiences. This isn #8217;t to say that this difference is because of that It may explain *some* of the reluctance to actualise fantasies. It may well be that the effect of shame in actualising these fantasies is the same for both genders, which would result in there still being more men who actually want to be subs. We don #8217;t know this bough until it is researched. However, if I was designing a study to explore the effect of shame on the actualisation of sexual fantasies, particularly stigmatised sexual fantasies, I would probably hypothesise that women would be disproportion effected because societal expectations placed on female sexuality, objectification and the expectation to put other peoples desires before their own. However, this is just a prediction based on my understanding of power relations. I could be completely off the mark but a study would need to be conducted to answer the questions I have. As for why we are submissive though, I don #8217;t think stats are that great. We have focused a lot on stats and gender differences, which I know I started haha, but I actually think that when it comes to understand what make any one person tick, qualitative data is more informative. While stats are interesting to look at men in relation to women, they fail to capture the complex relations of why any individual is like they are. There will always be people that fail to fit what the stats tell us and to understand why, we need to speak to them in order consider a much wider range of variables. As I said, for me shame has been a barrier. Even if it generally isn #8217;t for other, it still has been for me. So if I was in that study, that would be one person for who shame would be significant. I actually have a fairly decent re my submissive tendencies come through have spent lots of time in therapy and reflecting on experiences and moments in my life when these desires started to emerge (and who they were attached to). For a long time, my desires were unhealthy because I was re-enacting trauma. However, I have moved on from that now by only engaging in play with people I can trust. For me, i am almost certain it boils down to trauma but my trauma does cause my desires. It did but my desires are now actualised in a way which enables me to take control of scenarios in play that have otherwise been oppressive. Now his is not to say every sub is submissive for this reason at all. My story is just one story amongst countless others Edit: this isn #8217;t to say stats are pointless or anything otherwise I would have had his discussion with you. I think they can tell us lots of things but they are irreducible to any single person. To go back my question of shame, if hypothetically it was shown that women were more likely to not actualise due to shame, that would be very concerning and would beg questions around how female sexuality is seen and treated by wider society and culture. However, this would not be grounds to assume a single woman who does not want to actualise a fantasy is doing so out of shame because there could still be any number of other reasons for this. Edit 2: also, the reasons you gave for women not being active online could in part be why women are less likely to actualise fantasies, but again, we dont have any data on this</TEXT>

    <TEXT> gt;We do know that shame impacts whether people actualise fantasies, but saying  #8216;I don #8217;t want to actualise this #8217; is very different to saying  #8216;I feel ashamed to actualise it #8217;. Of course but if the study didn't measure why they didn't want to actualise it, it is possible that shame was a contributing factor. If i had been in this study before i actualised my desires, i would have fallen into that category. My shame wouldn't have been considered because if the study didn't ask why i didn't want to actualise it. This means that way the variables were categorised has limitations and further questions which could be addressed through another study. As a researcher, shame is something i would be interested in exploring in this data. It may or may not be significant but i would hypothesise it could be for reasons stated. That doesn't mean it will be.  gt;You could divide it into four categories: 1. People who don #8217;t feel ashamed and do want to actualise it 2. People who feel ashamed but would still actualise it if they could break through that shame 3. People who feel ashamed and never want to actualise it because of that shame 4. People who don #8217;t feel ashamed and also don #8217;t want to actualise it Yes exactly. This would be an interesting thing to explore i think.  gt;You #8217;re theorising that this 32% of women were number 3, but they could equally be number 4. I totally get that we are both hypothesising though. Im not, im theorising that the 32% could be distributed across any one of those 4 categories (as could the men), and that a study exploring this *could* tell us something different about our comparison between men and women if (and only if) shame came up as more significant for women than men. This is why i said shame *may* explain of of the observed differences. However, im not saying this would be the case. Im simply trying to illustrate how the stats never give us a full picture of what is going on because considering new variables can (not will) completely change what we can interpret from the data. This is one of the reasons im a qualitative researcher. I do have some appreciation for stats for some things but there are always huge limitations, even in the most perfectly designed random sampled study. Edit: when i say a study exploring this could tell us something different, im saying that if for example 30% of women ended up in category compared to only 10% of men, shame would become something that is is more likely to effect women actualising than men. However, i am not saying it explains why all women(or men for that matter) do not actualise fantasies.</TEXT>

    <TEXT> gt;but overall you think that shame might play a big part in why many women said they didn #8217;t want to actualise their desires. Im saying it could for some. We dont know because the existing research hasn't explored this. I was quite clear that i was speculating on information that wasn't explained by the previous study and that further study would be needed to test those speculations. I never said shame explained the differences in that study you share but rather that i thought it was something worthy of exploration. Of course not all the 32% would fall in the third category. It is a big might but given that we know shame can limit actualisation for some people and that women are shamed more than men for sexuality in lots of ways, I think it is an interesting question. *I am certainly not saying it is the answer*.  gt;I don #8217;t think the same. My theory is that shame is not a large factor here. If it was I would expect to see similar results between men and women. I #8217;m not saying it #8217;s a non existent factor but I don #8217;t think it accounts for the variation And that is fair enough. I'm honestly not sure how larger factor shame would be but given BDSM practices are stigmatised, i would be interested in finding out. I wouldn't expect to see similar findings for men and women because i think men are subjected to less stigma for exploring their sexuality, but again, i could be wrong. I'd be interested in finding out either way. I mean, the stats you shared themselves show a gender imbalance so perhaps different imbalances exist around different further research questions. Whatever the result though, I feel the explanation for differences would be social and cultural and not biological ( or at the very least, a mix of all of these things).  gt;I think throughout this discussion I #8217;ve shown my awareness of the limitations of statistics (I have repeatedly been drawing your attention to the limits of stats you have shared, and when I first shared this data I pointed out that it was limited) - I don #8217;t need to be reminded of that. You have. Sorry if it sounded like i was suggesting you didn't . I just felt that you didn't understand my position, for example when you suggested i thought the 32% were all ashamed to actualise. I never said that. I said that shame was possible contributing factor for some people not actualising (men and women) and that this contributing factor may be gendered but i didn't mean to come across as if i was saying it definitely would. I'm sorry if this wasn't clear. I was pointing out the limitations not because i thought you didn't understand them but so that i could more clearly articulate how what I'm interested in is responding to those limitations because i wanted to make my own position more clear in response to you misunderstanding what i was saying (which may well have been my fault. It is late and im not very articulate right now!) Sorry if it came across patronising. Edit: ive actually really valued your insights. The study you shared really challenged a lot of assumptions i have. I was just interested in thinking about it further because I've really enjoyed discussing these questions with you. That is why when i made my initial speculations i was really interested in what you thought about them. When we were talking about why women dont join online communities, that was also speculative without data but i thought you made loads of interesting points that indefinitely hadn't considered. I'm sorry if i made you feel like i didn't value what you had to say. We obviously have different theories for different reasons and limited data, so i was only ever theorising on what id be interested in study. I wasnt suggesting i know the conclusions of what those studies would be Edit 2: ignore my first point. I can see that you recognised that you were not saying i thought everyone fell into category 3. Your assertions there are right. That is what i was arguing and you disagree that this would be relevant. I misread your earlier comments as saying that shame definitely would not be relevant even thought it hadn't been tested for but i understand now this isnt what you were saying. We just have different theories</TEXT>

    <TEXT>It's worth pointing out that some psychiatrists don't think schizophrenia was to blame.

Chamberland suggested that #160;Magnotta #8217;s earlier diagnosis of schizophrenia in his late teens #160;was the result of #160;drug use." https://www.google.com/amp/s/www.cbc.ca/amp/1.2852607</TEXT>

I mean, if you read any study using stats, there is a lot of writing involved because you have had to interpret findings. You also have to talk about whether or not something is statistically significant, to what degree, and with what margin of error. All of these things are visible for the mathematical calculations themselves *but* there is a tendency for people to do the calculations but not understand what the output tells us.

    <TEXT>I'm gay not trans but i can really relate to what you are saying about trauma. Not so much now but definitely in the past. It's a tough one because we have worked on our trauma through detaching ourselves from religion but so many queer people cant, so that leaflet for a queer friendly church could be really useful and help someone who has been traumatised by a more conservative church. The other thing i wanted to mention was something i read by a queer theologian which was really interesting ( i wish i could find the article for you but i couldn't). Essentially, what she said was that when we oppose religion on the basis of it being oppressive and hating x, y and z, we reinforce the idea that the religious doctrine says what the homophobic and transphobic priests say it does, but it doesn't. They are reading from translations (albeit mainstream ones). The original texts are actually quite ambiguous and can be translated in lots of different ways. Also, whether or not Christians should be concerned with anything in the old testament is up for debate. As such, she argues that we should be focuses on what these religions could be rather than what we are told they are, because when we say the Bible is actually homophobic we are telling those that will follow Christianity anyway that homophobia is sin. I hope this makes sense. I struggled to articulate it.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Of course not. And for the record, I'm gay. I'm not defending homophobia. My point is that no activists from any group in the past would be worth quoting if we hold them to todays standards. A couple of years ago in the UK there was a women's match celebrating 100 years since the right to vote but not all women could vote. That right did not extend to all women and many suffragettes would have been racist and homophobic. However, it didn't stop people celebrating the movement. It's possible to celebrate the good things that people said and did whilst remaining critical of the bad things. The MLK quote makes and important point that still holds value.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I'm not, as clearly stated, I'm saying that pretty much every social justice movement back then was problematic. That doesn't mean I think it was ok, far from it. However, that doesn't mean that every single thing each movement fought for was bad. We can criticise MLK for his homophobia and misogyny without erasing his positive contribution to the civil rights movement. The civil rights movement, the suffragette movement and the LGBTQ rights movements all had faults, and i have absolutely no issue with those faults being caller out. However, If you are suggesting that people shouldn't listen to anything MLK had to say because he was homophobic, that same sentiment should be extended to all activists of that era who had blind spots to social injustices outside there own. Unfortunately, it seems that people are quick to hold MLK to account and shit all over the good things he achieved way more often than they would say the suffragettes of LGBTQ movement. That double standard is racist IMO. edit: also, while i agree that we should call out historical injustice, that injustice can still be contextualised within a particular social, material and cultural relations. As an SJW in the 21st century, i like to think that i stand up for justice because I'm an inherently good person. I'm not. Just as nobody is born a racist, a homophobe or a misogynist, nobody is born woke. Had i been born 100 years ago, i dare say my outlook would have been very different because i would have grown up in a society with different people and different ideas. Society and culture produces social injustice. We can call out problematic parts of history but i personally feel that this incessant individualising of social injustice is unhelpful because it does nothing to help us understand and change the social, cultural and historical relations that produce things like homophobia. Hell, as a gay man, I would have probably been closeted and homophobic myself back then because it would have been very difficult to find validation and pride growing up in that world. This is not to say everyone would have behaved that way back then. There were of course many people that challenged the system but they were a very small minority, which means the vast majority of woke people now wouldn't have been woke then had they been brought up in that context. Just to repeat, i do not think that makes it ok *at all* but when i judge individuals of that era, that context matters.</TEXT>

What you can do is just take the Jamsey Cramsalot Inhisass Facebook profile, do a reverse image search, and it'll show you where that image has been posted before. And from there, we were able to find the website that the picture was actually posted to initially. But it was kind of a male pornography website. So we're scrolling through all these pictures you know, next, next, next, and boom. We find a picture of the one that Jamsey's using without the Santa hat. So we knew that Jamsey had appropriated that image and added a Santa hat for his profile picture. So we knew, "Fuck, this isn't the kitten killer. " So we approached the Facebook group and said, "Hey, you know, it can't be the killer. Like, this cannot be him. " And they dug their heels in. "Nope, this is the guy. This is it. We're gonna get this guy. " We were dumbfounded. Absolutely dumbfounded.

    <TEXT>That video was uploaded on the fake profile with the image stolen from the porn site. The guy that killed himself was the porn star, not Jamesy. Jamesy was either Luca or some other guy but he was not the porn star that committed suicide. That is why they were so keen to make the group aware that he guy in the picture was not Jamesy. If the guy that had committed suicide was Jamesy, they would have had no interest in telling the group to leave him alone because they weren #8217;t going to protect a cat killer. We still don #8217;t know who Jamesy was but it wasn #8217;t the guy who killed himself. The guy who killed himself was the porn star (albeit a lot older because it was an old image).

    <TEXT> gt; Jamesy was an internet troll who took a picture of timmy the porn actor, cropped a santa hat on, and used it for his fake profile, where he uploaded a video of a cat being burned alive. This is correct but we still don #8217;t know who Jamesy is. Jamesy was not the guy they hunted down and drove to suicide because they hunted down the guy in the image, who, as you acknowledge, wasn #8217;t Jamesey. This is why the hosts of documentary told the group that the guy in the image was not Jamesy but they hunted him down anyway and drove him to suicide. I #8217;ve literally just rewatched that entire segment of the documentary. I stand corrected on Jamesy being Luka. It doesn #8217;t say that. However, the guy that they hunted and killed wasn #8217;t Jamesy, it was the guy in the image Jamesy used.</TEXT>

I mean, Timmy was not necessarily the porn stars real name and I was under the impression that the image was really old and that the guy that killer himself was  #8216;Timmy  #8217; but older. Anyway, whether it was the porn star or not, it wasn #8217;t Jamesy (whoever he may be), which is really sad. This is the problem I think with the internet.

    <TEXT>so in the documentary, they go from talking about how the group wouldn #8217;t listen to them when they said the guy in the image (Timmy) wasn #8217;t the cat killer. They then go on to say that  #8220;somebody had made the discovery of the real person #8217;s identity #8221; (Edward) who committed suicide. However, when they said they discovered the real persons identity, it isn #8217;t clear whether they are talking about the guy in the image or the guy who made the profile. I assumed it was the guy in the image because that is who they were talking about and warned the group not pursue before the documentary wen straight on to talk about Edward committing suicide. They call Edward Jamesey at one point as well, just to add to the confusion. However, given that they are hunting a cat killer anyway, had it been the actual person who created the profile, I would have been surprised if they had been so persistent in trying to get the group to leave him alone. After all, at this stage, Luka hadn #8217;t killed any humans so if they were willing to hunt down luka, they wouldn #8217;t have had an issue with the group hunting down another cat killer that did something just as bad. Here is the transcript...  #8220;So we knew that Jamsey had appropriated that image and added a Santa hat for his profile picture. So we knew, "Fuck, this isn't the kitten killer.

People are out for blood, you know, when this kind of thing happens. Emotions can get the better of you. Your inner fire is just argh! Not long after this, Jamsey had actually taken his own life.

    <TEXT>Yes, that #8217;s what I was thinking. It #8217;s a real shame that they didn #8217;t explore this more in the documentary. They jump so fast from talking about the porn star being hounded to then going on to talk about Edward. They never actually mention that the group stopped chasing the porn star and moved on to Edward, which was what made me think that Edward was the same guy. However, after looking at the transcript, I #8217;m not sure if you were not right all along and that Edward was the troll that created the Jamesy profile.It may have been that Edward ad seen the group hunting Luka, used that picture to make himself look like Luka, and then posted the video. After reading around it just now, apparently that video was really old so people think that Edward shared a video he found online rather than killed the cat himself. If that is true, I guess it wouldn #8217;t have been Luka because Luka would have just made a video.</TEXT>

    <TEXT> gt; ok, i thought it was a first upload wise Me too but apparently people have been saying they saw the video circulate several years prior. After reading this, I have to say that i don #8217;t think the profile was Luka because I don #8217;t see why he would use an old video. However, a troll wanting to fuck the animal rights activists might, so I guess it was Edward who made the profile and shared the video. I would have liked to have read more about Timmy though so if you find that article, let me know :)  gt; yea, the doc is a bit all over the place, many people have something against it, and i can see why, but i must admit, i enjoyed it, and i even enjoy this aftermath of finding all the details and stringing them together more. Yes, me too. I had a few issues with it. I thought it was very sensationalist and could have been more informative but I found it interesting and enjoyed watching it . The thing that pissed me off was the bit at the end when she asked if we as viewers were complicit. Given that many of us d about Luka after he was imprisoned, we certainly were not complicit. I think the question of the whether the group was complicit was an interesting one because the guy clearly got off on the attention he was getting from it. However, I think anyone who is willing to harm anyone for attention is dangerous regardless.  gt; maybe i liked it so much because they covered it so poorly and they kind of force you to dig a bit yourself if you want the whole story. Yes, I can see that. I think there are certain things that should have made it in there because the majority of people probably won #8217;t spend that much time investigating further, which can end up resulting in people being misinformed somewhat, but I don #8217;t think it was terrible.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>That's true. That said, I do think it is worth considering that just because someone has schizophrenia doesn't mean everything they think, feel and do is a product of their illness. In this case, the prosecution certainly didn't see his schizophrenia as relevant because he was tried as criminal. I'm no expert but I do have a psychology degree and I've studied social science up to PhD level. I have to say that I agree with the psychiatrists that supported the prosecution , who said his crimes were way too organised for someone having a psychotic episode because such episodes are characterised by disorganised chaotic thought. In Luka's case, we are talking about years of very precise and organised planning. Not just that, it is worth considering that his previous diagnosis of schizophrenia could have been wrong. Drug induced psychosis temporarily mimics the symptoms of schizophrenia. I know people have mentioned his father had schizophrenia, which does increase his chances of also having it, but the risk of developing the disorder is still low at 10% (compared to 1% of the general population). Also, to go back to point about drug induced psychosis, I wouldn't be surprised if someone with a schizophrenic parent would be more susceptible to developing such temporary reactions to drug abuse. Some people think that he has used his medical history to claim insanity. I think this is possible. From what we know about Luka, he was extremely manipulative and his crimes were incredibly calculated with lots of forward planning. His experience with drug induced psychosis would have definitely given him enough insight into the schizophrenia to mislead people conducting the psychiatric evaluation into a wrong diagnosis. Personally, I would not support him being tried as a criminal if his crime was a result of paranoid delusions. I remember reading last year about a mother who killed her child because of a psychotic where she though all the other kids were going to be killed if she didn't sacrifice her own. It was absolutely tragic but it was clear to the defence that she was not of sound mind in the lead up, during and aftermath of the crime because she was manic and out of control. As such, she was sent to to a mental institution rather than prison.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Thank you. I mean, I must admit that schizophrenia is not my area of expertise. I have some insight into from my studies and my mum is psychiatric nurse, so I've learnt a lot from her. From what I do know, I'm highly skeptical but as with any case like this, we have limited information. As you say, none of us will ever truly know. Even psychiatrists are limited, which is why some psychiatrists are contesting his original diagnosis. One thing I didn't mention that someone mentioned was that he also had links to the far right,which I thought was interesting considering his victim was Chinese (although I haven't had chance to look more into these claims to be honest). There is definitely a lot to unpack. I recommend this news article if you are interested in what other psychiatrists had to say on the matter. https://www.google.com/url?sa=t amp;source=web amp;rct=j amp;url=https://www.cbc.ca/amp/1.2852607 amp;ved=2ahUKEwit3JTBtYHnAhXUnFwKHXvsCWkQFjABegQICBAB amp;usg=AOvVaw2hjtRKzj-J6ZHLjIWQJX0W amp;ampcf=1</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I means, It #8217;s nothing to do with being misunderstood. If people use females when referring to males as men , as is often the case when females is used as anything other than an adjective, they clearly do not see men and women as equivalent terms because of assumptions they have about women. I mean, I see females used in contexts online that I never hear applied to men. As a noun, males is hardly ever used in comparison, unless we are talking about scientific contexts and nature documentaries. That said, I think this is an American thing. The only time I have heard women referred to as females here in Britain is in a British comedy sitcom where the father always asks his son whether he has been dating any females. The word females is included to mock the father, who is an out of touch old man. His use of the word females in an unfamiliar context where we would never use the word males is supposed to be creepy, and when asked the question, the son always cringes. However, it seems what is being mocked in that sitcom is a pretty standard thing in the US.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Ah ok, this makes sense to me now. I think in this particular case, I'd argue that it is less about personal preferences because of the shaming aspect. The shaming (particularly the homophobia) makes it a social feminist problem because she is passing judgment on his gender expression. Also, nobody has the right to expect people to fit into their gender ideals whether it's personal preference/attraction or not. The use of shame to police gender boundaries reinforces the gender binary and puts people under pressure to conform to unhealthy expectations. If she is not attracted to him anymore, fine, but she doesn't have to stigmatise him. Edit: I think it's also worth thinking about how personal preferences are not born out of nowhere. It's clear from the way she treated him and her homophobia that she has internalised lots of prejudices and biases around what it means to be a 'real straight man', so it's possible that he personal preference is tied up in that prejudice. That said, the thing that i feel needs addressing here is less her preference (regardless of whether it is rooted in prejudice) and more the way she goes about expressing that preference through femme shaming and homophobia, which contributes to toxic masculinity, homophobia and arguably to a gender binary that makes men like the OP less desirable</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I mean, personal sexual preferences do not emerge out of nowhere. Like any desire, they emerge in relation society and culture. We only need look at some of the queer/feminist/crtiical race studies literature on say sexual racism to see that people's reasons for excluding a particular race are often rooted in prejudiced assumptions. Even when people have preferences for BAME, these often emerge as a result of fetishisation, again rooted in prejudice, for example, the assumption that asian women are submissive or that black men are aggressive and dominant. When it comes to incels, it is possible that some of the reasons they have been rejected is down to societal prejudice, for example, that a feminine man is 'gay' (which is homophobic) and therefore less desirable, which i do think is something that can be talked about because femme shaming is often discussed in literature on gay men's sexual preferences. However, the issue i see with the incel community is that it doesn't question gendered societal biases that may lead to some men being deemed more desirable than others based on arbitrary constructions of masculinity but instead blames all women (and feminists aiming to deconstruct gender expectations). While it is possible that some of these men may have been shamed and excluded because of hetero normative patriarchal gender expectations, the way in which they often respond to this is misogynistic, which, unsurprisingly, makes them less desirable even to women that would not judge them on their masculinity. Edit: another thing that comes to mind is the double standard. Incels shame what they call the Stacey's of the world dating the Brads. They are angry at popular women getting with popular guys but they themselves are only interested in those popular women. They shame women for being superficial and fake for rejecting them based on superficial markers of beauty whilst they themselves reject women who don't live up to societal expectations (i.e. those they refer to as the Beckys). To go back to what I mentioned about discussions withing the queer community around how gay men often exclude men that aren't masculine enough, it would be the equivalent of feminine gay men calling out masculine gay men's femmephobia in dating while only being wiling to date masculine gay men themselves (and blaming everyone gay man who is masculine for their inability to do so). That is when a fair a valid critique of societal expectations and prejudices aiming to create a fairer and more inclusive society for all becomes nothing more than personal sexual entitlement. Edit 2: i must admit that my knowledge on incels is limited so if I've missed something and got anything wrong, please let me know .</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Adjectives are not bad. The OP is complaining about these adjectives being used as nouns despite being adjectives. For example, there is a difference between talking about 'female students' in a study and referring 'the females'. If i said, how should i support females (noun), i could be talking about about female dogs, cats or humans. However, if say how can i support female students at my university (adjective), i am not dehumanising women because female is simply modifying the humanising term 'students'. I would never say how could i support women students because women is a noun and not an adjective. Nobody is saying that we have to stop using male and female but rather that when we use them incorrectly, it is dehumanising (especially for women because women are more likely to be referred to as females instead of women than men are referred to as males instead of men).</TEXT>

    <TEXT> gt;1. If your wife has been caring full time for 2 year old twins, she is not "out of work" holy shit. I totally agree with this 100%  gt;Her job is waaaaaay harder than yours, believe me. I mean, it may be harder but it could also be equal. I know people working 60-70hours a week. Who knows what the OPs position is? Depending on their socio-economic position, he could be working multiple jobs to keep them financially above water. That doesn't make his work inherently harder but it doesn't necessarily make it waaaaaay easier either. Also, the difference is kind of relative. I never want kids because it sounds like way too much hard work. I know women that have had kids and gone back to work because they find it easier than looking after kids, but then I also know women who have had kids because they find more fulfilling at home. Also, what about people whose paid work involves looking after the kids of several parents that don't want to stay at home. I'd argue that this is just as hard. I also think whether or not someone enjoys their work, whether that be at home or in the work place, can have an impact on how challenging it is so i don't find it particularly helpful to say one type of work is inherently harder. Its subjective. However, i agree that the OP is TA for suggesting his wife wasn't working and that 'he doesn't mind'. However, when it comes to the spending, i think it is ok to mentioned that they are living beyond their means. I don't think it is unreasonable for anyone to want to avoid getting into debt. If the OP is already working a lot of hours and is unable to work/earn more, the only way of avoiding debt is to either by making cut backs or for his wife to get paid work and for them to then share childcare. I think it is one thing expecting him to financially provide because his wife is providing in other ways, but those financial provisions cannot be expected to be unlimited. $300 on make up is a lot of money for some people. At the moment, that is more than i pay in rent. Depending on the OPs income and job prospects, that kind of spending could be a huge issue. I personally wouldn't be able to afford to be with someone with those kind of spending habits. I feel like a fair thing for the OP to do would be to budget for shared expenses and then split any remaining disposable income between him and his wife.</TEXT>

    <TEXT> gt;1. ESH. Y T A for saying she has to get a job. I mean, if she is not willing to budge on spending, which as you say makes her suck, i think finding a paid job is necessary because nobody should be expected to get into debt. I think the OP sucks for assuming she doesn't already have a job but providing his current income is shared between them so that they are both being said an equal amount for their work and contribution to the family, i don't see anything wrong with telling her she needs to find paid work to fund her extra expenses. My partner and i split our income but recently i have been working more hours than him because i need a new laptop and our shared income is not enough to cover such extra expenses.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>NTA. I agree that it is a dated misogynistic tradition and understand why you wouldn't want it. I guess today, it is less about giving the woman away as property and more about showing support for your marriage/choices, but it does still have a history that people understandably want to beak free from. That said, given that the meaning of being given away has changed now that women don't need to the permission of their fathers to marry, have you considers maybe finding some other way of including your parents in the ceremony so that they can publically show their support? You could even include your husbands parents. I mean, if you are rejecting outdated traditions, why not rewrite some of the rules? You could have all your parents 'give' you away.</TEXT>

The only time I've heard women referred to as 'females' is in a British sitcom about a family, where the father always asks his son if he's dating any females. However, this isn't supposed to be taken seriously. The joke is on the father for being old fashioned because whenever he says it, his son cringes because it's the kind of language you'd expect to hear in a nature documentary</TEXT>

I think the best thing to do in these situations is express your feelings and support when she needs you but the rest of the time, act like things are normal. If he is that much of an arse, she should eventually realise it but if people are constantly telling her to leave him, giving her ultimatums or refusing to be a part of her life while he is around, she may well end up feeling more dependant on him</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Nearly all the trans inclusive feminists I know are post-structuralist. Post structuralism doesn #8217;t mean denying women exist. It is simply about acknowledging that the category woman does not exist as an essential immutable characteristic, and that it is irreducible to any universal single narrative. Intersectional feminism is post-structuralist because it acknowledges the multiple possibilities of what it means to be say a woman in relation to class, race, sexuality, place, age, education etc (and in doing so responds to critiques of earlier structuralist/materialist feminisms that marginalised differences within women. I do think that post-structuralism and queer theory *can* sometimes fall into the trap of making it impossible to define and talk about differences but it doesn #8217;t have to (it all depends on how postmodern it is). However, while a radical postmodern approach to gender falls into the trap of erasing differences and making it difficult to talk about women, a radical modernist approach falls into the trap of universal definitions of womanhood that erases the experiences of women or colour and working class women . When it comes to trans people, it is actually feminists that reject post-structuralism that are exclusionary because their understanding of how oppression works is essentialist and reductive .</TEXT>

    <TEXT>You are right. I think a lot can be gained from the ambiguity (I.e. understanding gender oppression as something that is irreducible to assigned to genitals, thinking about how intersections of class and race result in different embodiments of say man, woman or enby). However, it can be taken too far. I think early post-structuralists like Foucault, who has often been referred to as a coset structuralist, and Butler, who is arguably more structuralist than Foucault because of her feminist Lacanian insights, is a far cry away from radical postmodernism. Unfortunately, the way in which such complex theories often end up trickling down overemphasises the ambiguity, fluidity and different possibilities of resisting categorisation and classification (although personally, I feel like this is often a result of people not fully understanding the post-structural or queer theory they are drawing from). I am currently questioning the utility of post-structural theory and queer theory on LGBTQIA politics for my PhD thesis, and I agree that it can be problematic, particularly when it comes to interactions of race and class, which can impose strong material limits on things like sexual fluidity and individual sexual emancipation. Just as earlier structuralist work ignored intersectionality under the guise of universal definitions of  #8216;woman #8217; or  #8216;gay #8217;, more contemporary post-structuralist thinking can end up individualising things to such an extent that it becomes ahistorical , apolitical and asocial, detached from any structural concerns that impact some groups more than others. However, I reject the idea that post-structuralism is the problem because structuralism also completely ignored certain marginalised groups. For me, it #8217;s about developing theories that respond to the limits of both modernism and postmodernism. I guess it is important for people to consider what they mean by post- . We do not exist outside of structure but we do exceed structure because we are not completely devoid of agency. We can talk about women without reducing woman to something universal because the boundaries of what it means to be a woman are always being negotiated, challenged and pushed (which is not to say that women have agency that exists outside of systemic pressure). Edit: I should mention that I think a big issue with poststructuralism and queer theory is how inaccessible it is. It is only after several years of reading it that I was able to see that it wasn #8217;t completely denying structure but rather trying think beyond structure in roster to theories possibilities of resistance and social change. I think this is why the way these theories trickle down can end up being problematic. People use buzz words like  #8216;it #8217;s a social construction #8217; as if social constructions have no bearing on lived reality and we can just embody new one #8217;s at the flip of a coin. I have noticed an overlap between discourse of gender abolitionists and that of people talking about gender through post-structural queer theory. However, I #8217;d say this overlap is more due to people not fully understanding the theory because they have not engaged with how it is applied in sociological/psychological research and have just relied on ideas like  #8216;gender and sexuality is fluid #8217;. They are fluid but the process of of change is far far more complex and not always something that can be reduced to individual will</TEXT>

    <TEXT>YTA for not seeing a baby as a fully fledged human. I get that you feel uncomfortable around babies because I did too. However, this is something that people have to get over when they have babies in their lives (unless of course they don't care whether the baby grows up to like them). You think that your interactions don't matter because she's just a baby but this is incorrect. In many ways, such early pre-verbal interactions are some of the most important to development. You may not see it but babies are developing a distinct sense of self in relation to those around them. They may not be asserting themselves and relating to the world in a way that you can comprehend but this doesn't mean they are mindless creatures. I had this argument with someone recently, who said babies don't care what adults think. A good example to demonstrate why this is wrong is when a parent leaves a baby to cry rather than constantly giving into the baby's needs. Through this process, a baby starts to recognise itself as something distinct from it's caregiver and adapts it's behaviour in line with what their care giver expects of them. In essence, the baby starts learns to care about what others think in order to get what it wants. I really would recommend trying to get to know you niece because you may be surprised by how fast you get over your discomfort and actually learn to connect with her. It's not about being able to speak to her. Even when a child does start to speak, the way they express themselves can be really weird to those that have no experience with kids so it is still really difficult for a lot of people to even connect with young children. Before my nephew was born, I struggled to interact with all small children because I had no idea what to say to them. However, when you spend more time trying to get past the discomfort of not knowing what to say or how to act, you learn, and as you learn, you see start to see how much these interactions matter because this seemingly mindless creature starts develop a relationship with you which is actually quite specific and different from the relationship it forms with others. I'm going to leave you with this video my sister shared on Facebook last week of a father interacting with his baby. The baby is preverbal but it is very clear from her body language that she has developed a very meaningful relationship with her father. She is not just some stupid baby. Analysing the video from a psychology perspective, this is some A* parenting but actually quite rare precisely because parents often fail to recognise how connected their babies really are to what's going on around them. https://m.facebook.com/story.php?story_fbid=10156593444281378 amp;id=9335481377</TEXT>

I am currently writing up my thesis and realised that I have used gendered pronouns throughout to refer to previous work of people who may or may not identify as male or female but I'm thinking about changing all my citations to the singular they because while many of the people I cite will probably identify as male and female, it is likely that some won't (and given that in most case it is what they say rather than how they identify that is relevant to my work, their gender isn't relevant so I'm not about to research the identities of every author. The only thing that concerns me is that in some sense, gender does matter for representation. For example, I have made a conscious effort to not just cite dead white men, and using neutral pronouns for everyone would obscure that.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Thanks for this. When I put the author at the end it isn't a problem but when I cite that 'author (year) found x' and then want to carrying on talking about other findings from their work, I'm forced to either use pronuns or repeat the authors name. The latter option is fine once or twice but sound strange if referring back to them several times.  gt;Typically you can look authors bio's up to get an idea of how they are talking about themselves. Queer/non-cis academics are frequently out. This is a good idea. My research is on gender and sexuality and pretty much everyone im citing is feminist or queer so their bios should mention pronouns if it's something that matters to them. I guess I didn't want to assume they were he/she if they don't mention anything but I guess within the field I'm in, they would</TEXT>

    <TEXT>We have a guide for how the thesis needs to be laid out from our university but the referencing system is Harvard. There is definitely no mention of pronoun use in any of it. I mean, the singular they has always been accepted as the correct form when speaking about someone whose gender is unknown. I remember one of my led lecturers complaining that people always cited her as he instead of she and that if they didn #8217;t know, they should use they. I guess the issue I #8217;m having is that I don #8217;t know the pronouns of most of the people I #8217;m citing, which is why I am thinking of defaulting to they. I #8217;m almost certain this would be accepted grammatically because the issue of whether or not we should use gendered or non gendered pronouns is not a question of grammar but a philosophical question of how and when we can know gender.</TEXT>

People are free to reclaim it but as with every word with an oppressive history, I don't think we can expect everyone to reclaim it. Asking me to call someone 'it' feels like asking me to call someone the reword (which has also been reclaimed). I would happily use any other pronoun but I have an issue with it. I know it has been used to describe out sentient being but in the context of speaking about humans, it's been used to objectify and dehumanise people. My grandfather, a holocaust survivor, was referred to as it. I'm sorry but for me, using this word goes far beyond mild discomfort.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I think this is spot on for a great many cases and rings true to those that oppose a range of other social justice causes, although, and i'd be interested to hear what you think, i feel that this kind of defensiveness can be just as common if not more common amongst people that actually care about social justice. In my personal experience, I've encountered a lot of this defensive amongst people who support various progressive causes but don't like to see themselves as oppressors i.e. single issue activists, whether that be feminists, queer activists or class activists, who only focus on their own oppression. I'm a white working class gay man and for a long time, i didn't acknowledge my male privilege or my white privilege because i was so locked into the intersections of my experience that disadvantaged me that i couldn't see how i had any special advantages. The idea that I was contributing to other oppressions when i was fighting against sexual and class oppression took me a long time to recognise. Similarly, I've seen middle class white women downplay their class and race privilege. In fact, a white feminist friend shared a post on Facebook reducing white supremacy to the patriarchy, which, while definitely connected in a great many ways, kind of ignores the role white women play in the reproduction of systems of racism. Another friend who is a woman of colour actually challenged the post on this basis but my friend inititally refused to acknowledge it. She eventually came around but i think she was resistant at first because the idea of contributing to some kinds of oppression as someone heavily involved in fighting against other oppressions was difficult for her to admit. I've experienced something similar around white men being blamed for homophobia. While it's true that white men have historically played a disproportionate role in producing heteronormativity, the actions and attitudes of everyone (including queer people) contribute to it.I guess we don't like to think of ourselves as anything like those we are fighting against.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>A $3000 loan for someone who will be working in finance in London in a few years is not enough to end up in a serious financial hole. Someone on minimum wage in the UK could make the repayments on that amount providing they don't have other debts or children. To be honest, as someone who lives in the UK, i really would not recommend moving to London if a 3k loan to attend something as huge as your sisters funeral is such a massive financial concern. Also, if you have saved enough money for the next two years so that you don't have to work, there is nothing stopping you from getting a part time job alongside your studies so that you don't even have to take a loan. There are options and i feel like you should take them for something as big as this. You say you are responsible with money but if that were true, your two year plan would have accounted for emergencies. I'd recommend working part time not just for the funeral but for any other emergencies that could emerge over the next few years. If it isn't already clear, YTA, unless of course you don't value your relationship with your family for whatever reason. Sometimes other people we care about should come first. It seems that most people here are in agreement on this but you don't seem very receptive to their opinions. If you really didn't think there was anything wrong with missing the funeral, why post AITA? If you have been thinking about this enough to have to ask the question, it seems you aren't really sure. If that is the case, I would recommend the $3000 just to be sure not just for your family but for yourself because once you miss this, there is no going back. If you have any doubt, just go and worry about the $3000 later. You have two years savings, the potential earn a little but more money part time, and you take out a small loan to cover any short fall after that. Give this and your future career prospects in London or NYC , $3000 really is not a huge amount of money and especially not enough to end up in debt.</TEXT>

Although, from what he has said, that doesn't even seem necessary, given that he has 2 years worth of savings, no job and no debts. He could make back the 3k working part time alongside his studies or just take out a small loan before removing to london, which would be easy to pay back given his job prospects</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I agree with most of what you're saying but i still think he question of whether someone's right to drink trumps someones right to refuse to serve precisely because of this  gt; once the child is born and it has been damaged, the criminal courts might hold mother responsible. Aren't those that enabled this also responsible? If i had been serving a pregnant person in a bar on a regular basis to the point of intoxication and their child ended up damaged, i would certainly feel responsible and I'm sure many of those around me would hold me responsible. Even if i was not held criminally responsible, i could be held morally responsible and face social repercussions from those around me. And then there is the issue of whether or not the person i was serving was deemed of sound mind. In my country, it is illegal to sell alcohol to people too intoxicated because they are deemed unable to consent to drinking more. If anything bad happens, the seller can be held criminally responsible. As such, if it was deemed that a pregnant person was not of sound mind i.e. if they were deemed an addict, a bar tender could be held responsible for harm caused from serving alcohol. My mother is an alcoholic. She was not when she was pregnant with me or my sister but if she was to fall pregnant now, she would struggle to control her drinking. If she was pregnant and found out someone had been serving her alcohol, i would definitely want them to be held accountable for any damage caused to my hypothetical sibling after birth I do think there are lots of situations where alcohol should be served. As others have mentioned, people are not always buying alcohol for themselves. I would never refuse alcohol in a shop and would have no issue serving a round of drinks to a pregnant person in a bar because i have no way of knowing what they plan on doing with the drinks. However, if the person showed any signs of being intoxicated or if i saw them drink more than say a couple of glasses of wine, i would stop serving them and would probably refuse service if i saw them again because i have reason to believe their intention is to be intoxicated and i do not want to contribute to any damage that could be caused to their child.</TEXT>

    <TEXT> gt;there is no  #8220;right to drink #8221; unless we are talking about booze they made at home and drink at home. even then we are talking about right to privacy and only in some places. I mean, it depends where you live. In my country, it is illegal for a private business to refuse sales of goods and services to people on the basis of range of protected characteristics but being pregnant is not one of them.  gt;and the courts would have to prove the server knew they shouldnt serve them, Definitely. This would probably be difficult, especially given that it is likely that they were not the only ones serving alcohol. Also, many sellers wouldn't necessarily be aware that the alcohol was for the pregnant persons consumption. However, if there is absolutely any chance that a seller could be held criminally responsible for the consequences of a sale, I think it is reasonable for a seller to refuse to serve *if they know* the pregnant is going to get drunk. If it is expected that sellers don't discriminate on the grounds of pregnancy, it should be written into law that they cannot be held responsible for the consequences. The purchaser would need to be held fully accountable for there choices. However, this could be an issue when serving people who are already drunk. In my country, sellers are already held criminally responsible for serving someone who is too intoxicated regardless of whether someone is pregnant or not. However, If someone is pregnant and intends to see it through, the question of what is too intoxicated changes. I feel that the pregnant person should have to have take full responsibility for the consequences if we are to expect people to serve them. However, that would already be more responsibility than is demanded of non-pregnant people. I guess my last point would be that this isn't just about being held criminally responsible but also morally responsible, which could be a huge issue for people in small places where everyone knows everyone. If I sold alcohol to someone I knew was heavily pregnant and i knew intended to keep the baby, i could face a huge amount of social backlash from friends and relatives if anything bad happened to their child. As such, i would only feel comfortable doing it if i was obligated by law. However, in most cases i have no idea about whether someone is buying alcohol for themselves and/or wther they intend to see the pregnancy through. In those cases, i wouldn't refuse to serve. Edit: i agree with all of your points about not knowing whether someone intends to keep the child. I am referring to cases when we know that is not the case. I used to work in a small village pub where we knew a lot about our customers.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I mean, the small village in from is on the outskirts of a city in a country that is largely atheist. I don't really know anyone who practises religion. My town is very left politically. I have never met any pro-lifers and I am openly gay. Small cities here are nothing like those in the US because small villages are always pretty connected to cities. As for my morals, I am not passing any moral judgment. My concern is purely about servers putting themselves at risk of social or legal repercussions. As I mentioned, I would have no issue serving someone who was pregnant except for under the very rare circumstances that I know a person intends to keep the child. I feel that if a seller faces potential legal or social repercussions, the question of whether they sell becomes about their bodily autonomy as well. What i would prefer to see is drinkers held fully responsible and a law that means prevents discrimination on the grounds of pregnancy to match that because that way, the seller cannot be prosecuted, but more importantly, then can not be held socially responsible by their employer or the friends and family of the pregnant person, or even the pregnant person themselves, in the case of miscarriage or harm caused after birth. I don't think this is much to ask. If we are saying servers should always do x, there should be protection on place that means they are protected from legal and social repercussions, especially given that these jobs are incredibly low paid. Edit: just for the record, i do not feel morally responsible for someone else choices. This is purely about making sure i servers cannot be held morally or legally responsible by others. The current system provides bar tenders with choices and that choice means they may be held responsible by others. I say get rid of the choice and allow drinker to take full responsibility. I'm of the opinion that those that want to drink will drink anyway. If information and education isn't enough, not serving them isn't going to stop them getting intoxicated. I say let them make their own choices and if harm is cause after birth, then hold them responsible.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Thanks. It is also illegal here but on their website, they say they ship here, so I'm not sure if there is some loophole. The law we have is really vague. Basically, in order to get around all the legal highs, they released a really generic law that prevents the sale of any psychoactive substance. A friend said that because micro1pd is selling pills to be consumed in such low doses, it may not meet the criteria for what is deemed psychoactive. It is strange because someone could just take 10 of them and have a full trip but then i guess there are lots of legal substances that become psychoactive if people exceed the recommended dose. That said, this is all speculation. It may be illegal regardless. Now i know they are a reputable vendor, I'll give them a try and see :-)</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I think this may have something to do with lack of exposure. When i moved to my current city, i remember feeling the same. However, having since seen and met lots of men who dress feminine, i now have absolutely no issue with it. I think the first thing you need to address is the the idea that this reaction is somehow innate and cannot be changed. Clothing styles are social constructs. It's completely arbitary that dresses are designed for women. What you are dealing with is a life time of repeated exposure to certain items of clothing being associated with certain genders. It is the disruption to that which causes discomfort. However, exposure to people disrupting that can lessen it, but it won't if you don't believe it will. If you have it in your head that you will always feel this way no matter what and are not open to the possibility of change, it won't happen. Try to expose yourself to more gender non-conforming men online. That could be a good start. I think the idea that you cannot change this makes you YTA. However, if you recognise that this discomfort is something you can work on and reflection on you, not gender nonconforming men, i would say NAH. As for the sexual aspect of this scenerio, NTA.

    <TEXT>If would separate transgender in trans women and trans men (or just stick with women and men). If you need to reduce the number of categories, you could include non-binary as a generic term for anyone who does not identify as male or female, but in that case, i would definitely add a write in slot for other. I think it all depends on how you define and operational the terms in your research. In some research i did in the past, I stuck with 3 options (men, women and engy) because otherwise the sample size of those that identify with genders beyond the binary would would have been too small to draw any statistically significant conclusions. However, another way of doing this is to start with a beoad list, see how many people identify with each label, and then decide whether to collate them later. Edit: if you are listing trans separately, i would also say label men and women cis men and cis women because otherwise it looks like your suggesting cis people are the default.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I think this is the issue with statistics in general. The only way we can get meaningful data on trends that can be extrapolated across entire populations is by isolating variables, which inevitably comes at the cost of erasing the complexity of individuals. However, so long as the limitations are acknowledged, I dont see anything wrong with this. Statistics have a place. As a gay man, I could look at any statistics on men and masculinity and declare them invalid on the basis that it failed to consider any number of intervening variables that mark my experience off as different from that measured in a given study. However, that doesn't mean the statistics are completely useless. As a social scientist myself, i personally prefer to adopt a mixed method approach. I prefer qualitative research methods but quantitative data can be useful. Both have strengths and limitations. Also, when people complain about the limitations of individual academics' work, i feel some understanding should could given to the fact that many of us are on temporary insecure contracts and working up to 40 hours a week teaching, lesson planning and supervising student before we even get chance to do reaearch which has to be conducted, analysed and published within a limited time frame with an ever increasingly diminished budget. There are many structural factors that limit academic freedom, especially when working for universities in poorer countries with less funding. Academics are constantly having to negotiate this and make compromises to be able to do anything, so of course there are limitations. However, i feel the important thing is for academics to be open and honest about those limitations. Finally, i think it is great that the OP came here. Within academia, there is an increasing demand on researchers to involve the public in the design of their projects. This isn't necessarily about getting people to do our homework but rather acknowledging that irrespective of our areas of expertise, we have blind spots and biases result from our lived experience. The best way to address that is not read books but to actually speak to people and groups who are impacted by what we are doing</TEXT>

Like you, i also adopt a participatory approach to research precisely because reducing people to numbers is IMO always a micro-aggression when researching marginalised populations. However, given that this project is specifically on micro-aggressions, i guess it more problematic. I think they definitely need to offer an option for participants to self -id, but even then, i would question the use of quantitative data for a project like this.

Definitely.  gt;They seemed to be doing it on behalf of some kind of business though, which makes me feel less generous/ I missed that. I actually thought it was maybe for an undergraduate project or something but if not, that concerns me too. I mean, community action research is great for empowering people but that isn't necessarily the goal of a lot of business. I can imagine marketing companies investing in research developed to make money by offending and hurting people less (quantitatively speaking) as opposed to actually helping people. I guess they could be working for an NGO but then, i would be surprised if an NGO would employed someone with such limited background knowledge to do such a project. The fact that transgender was listed as a separate gender was a huge red flag for me. Whether someone identifies with the gender they were assigned at birth should be an entirely different question.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I mean, I'm not a SJW type on Tumblr. I'm a social psychologist with a pretty good understanding of where this kind if discomfort comes from . You obviously don't need to work on this if you are not going to openly express yir discomfort to people but personally, I found it quite liberating not to care. Life is too short for feeling uncomfortable about what other people. These feelings are not born out of nowhere. It's one thing not to want to sleep with someone but quite another to be trigger by what clothes someone where. This isn't born out of nowhere. It develops because we are told men should be men. As someone else said, why is it that people have no issue with women dressing masculine? Go back 50 years and almost everyone would have felt uncomfortable around feminine men (in some countries most people still do). However, there are countries today where most people don't have those feelings.</TEXT>

    <TEXT> gt;if male judges give female offenders lighter sentences for the same crimes, maybe men in charge don #8217;t necessarily give men a leg up? I definitely agree that the issue is men but I would argue this is because patriarchy also depends on men subjagating other men. Also, the whole thing around telling boys to 'man up', which produces toxic masculinity that harms everyone including the men themselves, is something that men and women participate in when raising/taching boys. I think feminist theory can be useful for addressing some issues men face because lots of problematic assumptions about masculinity come from attitudes towards women.</TEXT>

I feel it was for me, not anyone else, to say whether working for a private company was more or less exploitative. Personally, having people trying to force me to work for private companies and not do sex work *was* oppressive and exploitative because those people were trying to force me to sell my body for far as money than I was able to make doing sex work .</TEXT>

I'm not saying you should do nothing, especially given that you like the work you do and the chores you do around the house, but I feel it is only fair that she does more. Perhaps you could think about just splitting the jobs she really hates?

I think most of us would accept that our identity and sense of self in relation to others is at least to some extent a product of the society and culture we grow up in LEven our truest self, i.e. the self when nobody else is around, is tied up in lived experiences, desires, anxieties and traumas that emerge in relation to social, cultural and historical relations. Had any of us grown up 100 years ago or even today in a completely different culture, our sense of self and identity in relation to those around us would be different. I feel this is what is being expressed by the idea of performance and identity as matter of doing rather being because identies do shift a great deal across time and place.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I'm really glad you pointed out the grammar because I have actually come across a lot of people using trans as a noun not because they are transphobic but because they have a very poor understanding of grammar. It is a big issue here in the UK because for a long time, grammar wasn't really taught in schools because people assumed it was something that could be learnt intuitively. While this is true for many middle/upper class children with lots of exposure to people speaking proper queens English, it is not true for everyone. Some people need to be taught the rules of the language to counter mistakes they've routinely read/heard. As a working class person, I've had to teach myself grammar. Several years ago, I wouldn't have been able to tell you the difference between trans women and transwomen, and it had nothing to do with my attitude towards trans people. I just didn't understand the language. Interestingly, since grammar has been put back on the syllabus, there has been a lot of resistance from middle class leftist parents complaining that kids are being worked too hard by having to learn grammar they never had to learn completely sidelining the fact that not everyone is privileged enough to be surrounded by people always speaking gramatically correct English. They expect everyone to speak proper English but complain about grammar being taught in our schools :(.</TEXT>

From what I understand about the US, service staff are paid less because of the expectation to tip, so when you buy a meal, the restaurant in selling it cheaper because they are expecting you to foot some of the cost of service. For that reason, if I was in the US as a tourist, I would always tip even if service wasn't great because I wouldn't see the tip as an extra in the same way I do here. The only time I wouldn't tip in the US would be if the service was that bad I expected the waiter/waitress to be fired.</TEXT>

    <TEXT> gt;Women are not at an economic disadvantage, at least in the UK Not true. The pay gap exists. While some of this is down to women's career 'choices', those choices are not detached from social expectations such as having to take on the burden of childcare. Also, jobs perceived as feminine pay less (and some of those jobs used to be much more highly regarded when performed by men). And then there are things like this. Men on average inherit more money than women, and inheritance gives people a competitive advantage.  gt;What makes you think I have an advantage at school from my wealth? I'm not taking about things like private education. I'm talking about things like being able to go to school well fed and not having to take on caring responsibilities for relatives because your family couldn't afford that kind of thing. These kinds of things result in lots of children missing school and going to school hungry and tired (if they even get to school). And then there are all the other challenges associated with poverty that kids face. Private school and not having to worry about student debt is bonus but it isn't the only mark of privilege.  gt;What privilege does someone have moving from Pakistan to the UK in the 1970s? Please tell me what privileges a brown immigrant child who barely spoke a word of English had in the 70s? The fact that you can inherit so much money and say you don't need it is a privilege. You have literally inherited more money than some people living in the uk earn in their entire life and you act like it's nothing. That is privilege. If you can't see that, I am not sure I will be able to convince you otherwise but I will try. There are different types of privilege and oppression. Class privilege is real but that doesn't erase various disadvantages and privileges someone may have around gender and race (interestingly you were quite quick to deny gender privilege when you said women don't face an economic disadvantage). Im sure you and your sisters have faced lots of issues around racism. I wasn't denying that at all. I also have no idea what your parents had when they came here. They may not have had any economic advantage over others when it came to their success, and even if they did, im sure they face other barriers in terms of race as well. Again, one oppression doesn't erase other privileges. However, their success would have given you and your sisters an economic advantage over kids from less affluent backgrounds. There is nothing wrong with this but it is a kind of privilege, which is why we have inheritance tax to level the playing field (a playing field that is biased against working class people and many racial minorities more likely to be working class) Tax funds services that enable people from less affluent background to have more of a chance succeeded. Statistically, you were always more likely to succeed than someone from a working class background. Inheritence is a huge issue when it comes to suataining economic inequality. I mean, just look at some of the richest people in America who are still profiting from money inherited from slavery. Obviously that is very different from what you describe because it's not like your a billionaire benefiting from generations of inherited wealth but im just trying to make the point that inheritance sustains privilege along economic lines. Obviously your advantage over working class people is nothing like their advantage over anyone 99% of us but it is still and advantage that made people like you far far far as likely to ever have had to rely on things like food banks etc etc.</TEXT>

I'm not sure if this would apply to getting out of paying inheritance tax but it would certainly give them the right to divide money between the kids however they want. I dont think the sisters can legally object to 50/25/25 if that was what the parents asked for. With regards to the house, even though it was solely in the OPs name, they could still be legally entitled to 50/25/25 even if he didn't offer if the sisters could prove his name was only on their to avoid tax.

    <TEXT> gt;Men have men-centred issues that people should work on. I think a lot of these issues are just issues that don't need some overarching movement I would agree this, although I feel that on certain issues, the discussion needs to go beyond men just talking amongst themselves about those issues and does require some kind of activism against assumptions of society as a whole. The main I am thinking of here is boys being told to man up. As a queer man, those kinds of expectations hurt me a lot growing up, but even straight cis men can be affected in lots of ways by such expectations to adopt unhealthy toxic masculinity. I guess for me, this would fall under a very loose definition of men's rights because those expectations are society wide, reproduced by both teachers and parents of all genders.</TEXT>

I find it odd how when they choose, they're feminists but if you choose, you anti-feminist. It's similar to the discussion around makeup. If I as guy wear makeup, im so brave for going against social expectations but if a woman wears makeup she must be doing it for men. She couldn't possibly (like me) be wearing it for herself [sarcasm]. As others have said, the issue isn't about choices but rather expectations that shape choices and put some people under more pressure to conform to rigid expectations. However, even in the absence of such expectations, some people may still choose to take on such roles in the home. Those roles are just as valuable even if they are often not recognised as such, although if I was to stay at home, I would expect that recognition from my partner.

    <TEXT>I mean, what man? A black man, a gay man, a working class man, a working class black gay man? While we may say men are privileged in certain context, that privilege may shift and change in relation other variables so I dont think it is possible to get such a definitive figure. We can say that certain types of men are more likely to experience privilege but when it comes to individual men, lots of factors may enable or displace that privilege.  gt;Studies that have controls, and keep variables constant etc. But studies that do this rely on abstracting variables for measurement which in real life dont exist independently of the countless other variables that are not measured (variables that are constantly changing according to with who, what, where and when we are interacting). IMO there is no such thing as objective reaearch because individuals are far more complex than a handful of categories. However, research can give us an indication of some kind of power imbalance. However, the limitations or statistics mean that we can define privilege in such universal way. I'm a critical realist so I'm interested in casual tendencies that can be measured rather than cause and effect. The former considers how certain variables are *more likely* to lead to certain outcomes but unlike the latter, avoids assuming that those variables cause certain outcomes. Whether or not they do or no is dependent on a whole range of other variables that may come into play</TEXT>

    <TEXT>As I said, I dont think we can tell whether one individual is more privileged because if we are looking at individuals, so many other variables come into play. What we can observe are things like whether men are more likely to be accepted into certain fields. That doesn't mean that every man in said field is accepted because of privilege or that every woman is rejected because she is a woman, but if we observe that women in general are less likely to accepted into that field, that is evidence that men *are more likely* as a group to experience an advantage - *more likely* not guaranteed. To put it another way. When I teach my students about economic privilege, they often come back with examples of people from working class backgrounds becoming successful. This is a good example of bow individuals within an oppressed group can still succeed and and access privilege. However, when thinking about working class people as a whole, we know from statistics that those that experience class mobility are the exception and not the rule. As a rule, being working-class makes someone least likely to be economically successful than someone who is middle class. If I was faced with two babies in a hospital ward, with one from a middle class family and one from a working class family, and told I had to bet money on which one would be most economically successful, I would bet on the middle class one because the odds are staked in their favour. Those odds are to some extent measurable, but that doesnt mean the working class person won't end up more successful, it just means that they are less likely to be. Edit: for the record, I am not subscribing to an idea of male privilege that can exist independently of other intervening variables. I am a man from working class background in a very middle class careers. I recently had a middle class woman tell me that it was easier for people like me to get into the field, which I challenged because people from my class background are actually far less likely to even get the necessary qualifications. While I mat have advantages of over working-class women entering my field, I certainly didn't have advantages over the privately education person I was speaking with, so I reject these simplistic notions of privilege. A bit of wider context is necessary when evaluating this stuff because there is no such thing as man versus woman that exists independently of race, class, sexuality etc. The kinds of men and women we are comparing are going to change what we can say about privilege. This is true for any social science research. When different variables come into play, power relations shift. Quantitative research is always limited, which means we can't use it to make absolute judgement about any single individual, but that doesn't mean its useless</TEXT>

    <TEXT> gt;So does this mean women more likely to enter a field are privileged in that field? I don't see why not. I mean, there are various issues around assumptions made about men working with children.  gt;We're talking bets now, which means probability. IQ is the largest predictor of life success, before wealth. So if you had two babies from different classes, to maximise your chances I'd bet on the baby with the higher IQ (not that you can test a babies IQ) Do you have any stats in this? Also, as you say, we don't have access to IQ do if I had to bet, I would bet on class because we know that kids from more deprived socio-economic backgrounds are less likely to be economically successful and gain higher education. A working class person who ends up with a high IQ may have an advantage against class barriers but that doesn't mean class barriers don't exist. Inherited wealth affords many advantages. Also, middle class kids are less likely to end up going to school hungry. They are also less likely to end up missing school or going to school exhausted because they have to take care of siblings and sick relatives, and that's here in Europe where we have healthcare and some welfare provision. If I was better on kids somewhere like the US where poor people are literally left to die and given nothing, I would double my bet on a rich kid being more successful. A working class person with the equivalent IQ of middle class person is less likely to be successful. Again, this is not to say that every middle class person will succeed or every working class person will fail. Privilege doesn't work like that. It is impossible to determine where any single individual will end up but as groups, some people stand more of a chance</TEXT>

    <TITLE>A question about families of choice within LGBTQ ballroom culture</TITLE>
    <DATE>2020-02-12 12:04:27</DATE>
    <TEXT>I have been reading about ballroom culture in the US and how black and latino LGBTQ youths kicked out of there homes would join balls and be taken in by houses led by elders within the community that took on parental roles. I was just wondering if there was a similar phenomenon within the white LGBTQ community, or perhaps homeless white working class LGBTQ youth were welcome in ball culture? Just to be clear, I'm not asking whether there was a white ballroom culture, I'm asking whether older white LGBTQ people provided such support for LGBTQ youth. I'm guessing that such support was on the whole less necessary for white people because of white privilege and the ability for young white people to be more economically independent. However, white working class LGBTQ youths would have similarly be rendered homeless if kicked out of their family homes.</TEXT>

    <TEXT> gt;Certain tropes or stories in fanfic don #8217;t have the same power imbalance that comes from women being looked down on or being taken advantage of. I'm not sure if I agree with this. There are plenty of issues that come with gay guys being fetishised by women that amount to a power imbalance. While this is different because the person is bi, heterosexual women fetishising gay men does amount to privilege. They have heterosexual privilege, even if gay men have male privilege. There are lots of implications of this kind of fetishisation, for example, queer spaces becoming increasingly sanitised to attract the pink pound from straight women making those spaces less safe for those wanting to express sexuality freely. Some queer fetish spaces have ended up being treated like zoos for straight people. I have absolutely have no issue with straight women entering queer spaces but when I hear things like 'I love gays' from someone that doesn't know me, it is objectifying and dehumanising. As for the bi friend, as a woman, she is contributing to this even though she herself doesn't benefit from straight privilege.</TEXT>

Yes, I think you are right  gt; Also, my question to you is why are you interested in finding White LGBTQ+ members in a predominantly Black and Latino space? It #8217;s actually for some research I #8217;m doing on working-class queer history. I wasn #8217;t expecting to find middle-class white people in this ball culture but I was curious as to whether working class white people participated just because the kinds of support systems that developed around economic hardships of LGBTQ PoC. I guess I wondered whether white working class homeless youths ended up on the scene. This may have seemed like a stupid question because as I say, I #8217;m writing from Europe where queer history is less segregated by race.  gt;Now in contemporary times it's more common to see more white people within Ballroom culture after the mainstream success of "Vogue" by Madonna. Yes, I can imagine. I wasn #8217;t too interested in those that joined the scene after it became fashionable. I guess I was interested in whether any white people ended up in it out of necessity, taken by older members of the community when homeless etc. However, this doesn #8217;t seem to have been the case. Edit: I must admit that since writing this, I read somewhere that ball culture was very underground so I think I may have overestimated how many LGBTQ people of colour participated in it in general Edit 2: my question was also to make sure that when I reference the subculture, I didn #8217;t just make assumptions about the absence of working class white if some of these families were taken such white people</TEXT>

In my opinion it being underground is kinda myth (in my opinion) Ah ok, I will stay away from referencing it as underground in that case  gt; So you are making a paper about Ballroom culture and is looking for white LGBT+ people or are you doing a paper about white LGBT+ people in general?

Most of this will be from a British contest but I wanted to mention some aspects of US queer history. It #8217;s not exclusively looking at white people. I will be looking at erasure along the lines of gender, race and class. I just wanted to make sure that the ball scene was just black and Latin.

I don #8217;t care if they support people fighting for class liberation if they are not considering other intersections of oppression because I reject class essentialism. Likewise, if a feminist supports an ideology that supports class oppression and/or works against candidates that are fighting for class liberation, they don #8217;t get a free pass for helping women because the question is, which women? What about working-class women I.e. the women most likely to have been effected by her prosecuting truant kids?

    <TEXT>I think everyone is at least a little bit sexist, just as I think everyone is a little bit homophobic, racist and transphobic, because we all grow up in a world with biases, and we even internalise some of those biases ourselves. I think recognising is a good thing because it means being  #8216;woke #8217; is not something you are or are not but rather something that is a learning process. None of us are perfect, we all have blindspots, and there we could all make improvements. I didn #8217;t used to think this way until I saw a presentation by a gay Muslim man. He started his talk by saying he knew we were all at least a little it homophobic and racist because even he has to battle internalised biases. He argued that our failure to recognise this often limits dialogue, as people are so desperate to not be -phobic or -ist that they get defensive when issues around systemic issues are raised. He also said that the belief that we are all either racist and homophobic or not results in a work brigade of people investing all their time and effort into othering those they see as not woke to feel better about themselves rather than working on themselves. He wasn #8217;t suggesting that we should stop challenging bigotry or anything but was rather saying that when we do so, we should do it from a place of honesty, recognising that non of us call in or out from a holier than thou place of perfection.</TEXT>

It's really interesting and covers some of the same period that Chauncey covers. There are a lot parallels in relation to class. One of the things I've really enjoyed reading about is actually how a lot of the very early interactions happened in working class and immigrant cultures which were already seen as lacking bourgiois heteronormative respectability (and the respectability politics that then emerged within those communities as working class people and PoC tried to assimilate to be seen as more respectable). If you haven't already read it, Fergusons Aberrations of black is a really good one on queer history. He essentially argues that working class history and black history are both queer histories because these community were othered as queer.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>NTA but only because it's your country. However, one of the things I often see which I think is problematic is this construction of the west as the land of gender and sexual emancipation, which raises questions around emancipation for which women or LGBTQIA+ people? Jasbir Puar writes a lot about this in her concept of homonationalism, which she argues manifests as the west others those outside as sexually regressive, often used to defend foreign intervention in ways that a) ignore how in many such countries, the west has played a key role in histories of sexual oppression through colonialism, b) silence the voices of the actual marginalised people in those countries the west is supposedly protecting according to white saviour narratives and c) ignore how whoen sexually marginaliaed people from such countries do move to the west, they often speak of having replaced one form of oppression with others. For a lot of people, sexual and gender emancipation are not the only things that matter because they are also struggling against other oppressions. Sometimes people put up with some kinds of marginalisation and hide aspects of themselves that would be more accepted in the west because they want to maintain racial, national and class solidarity against other forms of oppression that they perceive to be bigger issues for them, and the voices of those people are ignored when the west is constructed as a beacon of progress because it is often the west's history of exploitation that is being resisted. Even within supposedly progressive nations, some groups don't get to be as free because of economic inequality. I was reading recently about some lantino gay men in the US who didn't want to come out because they depended on their families for economic support. Even in the west, it's easier to come out if you don't have to rely on others to survive, and such economic independence is not afforded to everyone equally</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Strange. I mean I get that people have their own relationship with sex and the way they dress but to push that on to others is wrong. Also, the idea that you need to cover up suggests she has some kind of moral stance on the issue, which is bad enough when coming from someone who is religious but if she is an atheist, she maybe needs to reevaluate what exactly her basis is for assuming what you are doing is wrong. As you say, it could b jealousy. She may be a prude due to personal insecurities, but she has no right to project that on to you. Personally, I would sit her down calmly and ask her why you living your life the way you want is such a high issue for her. If you want to save your relationship with her (and I wouldn't blame you if you didn't), I would tell her that the tension between you is seriously damaging your relationship and you would like to just have a discussion about why she has such a problem with your choices.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I can't speak for asian cultures but such responsibility to family is actually quite a strong part of working-class culture where I am from. Family and community can be big things to a lot of people, and I think it is important to acknowledge that is isn't always out of choice but actually out of long histories of people *having* to rely on each other and not having as much freedom to be able to go off and do their own thing. There is a privilege in not having to rely on others this way. I myself am working class family and my mum broke to mold and pushed me to do my own thing but I live with a lot of guilt for not being around enough when my grandparents were sick. While I was brought up to embrace indivudalism, my grandparents never had the privilege of being able to exist independently and while they said they were happy with me doing my own thing, I knew that they didn't quite understand why I couldn't be there for them. In my experience, middle-class people are far less attached to family and community. Indivudalism is encouraged but it is encouraged because is easier for middle class kids to exist alone. edit : I would say NAH but would urge the OP to really think about where they will feel NAH if anything happens in that year because as I said, I have suffered a lot of guilt and no amount of me knowing that I did nothing wrong has changed that.</TEXT>

I definitely agree with this but I would probably say it is a good idea to be aware of the power someone is more likely to have and not, as can be the case, assume an individual has that power. As you say, men and parents tend to have more power. For this reason I, like many others, often end up asking for extra information to ascertain whether that is the case. However, I do not, as many do, automatically assume that an imbalance exists, especially because there are often other intersections that effect power dynamics that are not always mentioned such as differences in age, class and race.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I think you are right about humour sometimes being useful. Your comment actually reminded me of the concept of gallows humour, where people use humour to deal with the harsh realities they face. Such coping mechanisms have been recorded under the most traumatic circumstances, for example concentration camps, where inmates would actually joke about the terrible things that were happening to them. I guess a lot of it comes down to who is making the joke? For example, a woman who had experienced slut shaming and victim blaming may have been better received? I personally don #8217;t like such jokes full stop. However, I also don #8217;t think it is my place to tell someone how to deal with their trauma and bring light to issues they face. I #8217;m a gay man and I personally don #8217;t like it when gay men reclaim the f-word or sissy, especially when they say things like ,  #8220;come on f** #8221; . However, I understand that they are reclaiming it and using humour to subvert the power those words have had on them, so while I don #8217;t like it, I have no business telling them to stop. However, if a straight person said something like that, I feel I have the right to call that shit out.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Yes, I think you are right. I guess it #8217;s a difficult one with regards to those particular words because they are being reclaimed everywhere within my community. I know a lot of people really don #8217;t like the word queer but when they bring this up with queer activists, there concerns are often shut down. I guess for me the line is them calling me a f**. If they want to reclaim it as an identity for themselves, that is their business. However, if they called me it or asked me to refer to them as a ***, I would feel uncomfortable. I think queer is different because it has both positive and negative connotations depending on whether we think difference is a good thing. I also feel the same about he pronoun  #8216;it #8217;. I had a friend that wanted to be referred to as  #8216;it #8217; but it made me uncomfortable because for me,  #8216;it #8217; is triggering because i associated it with being dehumanised. I don #8217;t feel comfortable calling anyone  #8216;it #8217;, partly because of my experience of being referred to that way but also because if I started calling someone it, people around may assume I am dehumanising them. With all that said, I #8217;d say I don #8217;t have an issue with people using words that make me uncomfortable so long as I #8217;m not made a part of it if that makes sense. I guess for me, it comes down to us all have different coping mechanisms, so while they should respect my feelings and avoid language that triggers me, I should also respect their feelings and consider how me expecting them to restrict that language may impact their ability to cope with trauma.

They can call themselves what they like and talk about their own experiences and traumas in ways that make them comfortable *but* I do draw the line of them projecting this stuff on me, which they respect. However, there is definitely an issue within certain queer activist spaces with everyone being expected to reclaim everything, which can be a problem. I also really disagree with some of the ways it has been reclaimed, for example, diesel designed and sold a jacket with f** written all over it. I have no issue with my friend reclaiminh that word as an identity for themselves and making light of their trauma in situations where if they didn't laugh, they would cry.

    <TEXT>Of course it's different but if someone has experienced people telling them who they can be and what they can do with their body because of their assigned sex and they think that is unjust (which it of course is), I think they are a hypocrite for supporting anything that tells others within the community what they can do with their bodies sexually on the basis of either their assigned sex and/or gender identity. The issue of bodily autonomy still applies. I would say the same if a gay man was being called out on transphobia, and I have seen many trans people say similar things in relation to lesbians that are transphobic. As for her being mistaken for a gay, it could change something. It is entirely possible that she is bitter towards gay men because of others making such assumptions about her. Homophobia could be her way of resisting that (not that it is right). edit: I know that transitioning is very different but it is similar enough to make someone a huge hypocrite for being gay and transphobic or trans and homophobic. I can't even begin to imagine how I could possibly in good faith argue that I have the right to exist do what I want with my body sexually while opposing someone elses right to to identify and express gender freely. If I am rejecting normative expectations placed on people's bodies on the basis of an assigned sex I will be consistent because it isn't just about *me* and *my* freedom to be and express myself how I want. If I think telling people it is unjust to limit people's expression on the basis of what is on their birth certificate, I think it is unjust regardless of whether it is me or someone else being oppressed. Edit 2: she could have the same ideas as the straight people around her but unlike the cis straight people she would have grown up with, she would have experienced people telling her she is confused, that she doesn't exist, that she can't exist, that she is perverse etc etc. Going through that and then still supporting an oppression of others that is different but still centred on restricting the freedom of expression of people on the basis of assigned sex or gender identity is what makes her a hypocrite. The cis straight people haven't experienced anything like that. Edit 3: being beaten up and called a f** would bother anyone regardless of gender identity. There are straight men who are homophobic after such experiences. Anyone who has experienced such violent homophobia can become resentful and hateful towards gay people and want to do anything they can to distance themselves from them. They don't have to be gay and they don't have to be male.</TEXT>

If we are talking about mainstream productions, so much of this stuff is highly staged so that extra time on camera demands so much more work.

I know others have said that the traditions of indigenous cultures should not take precedence over animals lives but to that I would argue, what about the lives that would be lost by forcing these communities to integrate with and participate in global capitalism, a system that disproportionately harms such communities. You are right. People failing to look at the nuances of this from the privileged position are racist. Many of these cultures are far more sustainable and cause far less harm to everything (human and animal) that lives on this planet.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Sorry, I was perhaps overly sensitive because I have worked in mental health and I am so used to coming up against misinformation and fear, particularly when it comes to illnesses commonly associated with psych wards I.e. schizophrenia. In most instances, people who are institutionalised are more of a risk to themselves than anyone else. I wasn't sure whether the OP was looking for a date to be honest but if they were, I agree that mental health issues are definitely something to think about before diving into a relationship with someone. Given that this was on a psych ward, I would also question issues around consent. The OP said she went home but I got the impression that the guy stayed on the ward. Here in the UK, that could mean that he has been sectioned, in which case, I don't think he would legally be able to consent to a relationship, which could explain his inability to respect boundaries set by the OP. However, providing both are capable of consent, I don't think dating someone with mental health issues is inherently a bad idea. I think that the question of whether it is good or bad depends on the the issue and how severe It is, but most importantly, how capable and willing the other person is at navigating the extra challenges, not to mention also considering the myriad of other things the person they are dating brings to their relationship. I think a hard set rule on whether people should or shouldn't date someone with mental health issues is ablelist because it goes beyond choosing not to date someone ourselves and projects that on to others. It ignores all the valid reasons why individuals may choose to take on the extra challenges of dating someone with a mental health condition. After all, they are connecting with someone who is more than an illness. I have struggled with partners in the past with mental health difficulties, which was difficult, but I do not regret those relationships. I don't think there is anything wrong with asking people whether they have reflected on the potential implications of dating someone with a mental health problem, for their benefit and the person they're dating, but that is different from telling them not to, which reduces the person they are dating to nothing but a condition. Finally, I also wanted to mention that many on psych wards are there on a one-off basis following traumatic events that they recover from. Some of those that are scared of people in such institutions will end up in one, and many that have come out of them have far better control over their mental health than people in the general population that have issues that are ignored, undiagnosed and untreated. I don't think whether or not someone has been in such an institution is a good measure of how stable they are</TEXT>

    <TEXT> gt;Something I want to raise awareness to though is consent does not equal a good relationship. But as you said, it depends on how capable and willing someone is to deal with the other persons mental issues Yea, this a good point.  gt;Sure, putting up rules in the sense of laws would be ableist. But giving people advice on if they should date a mentally ill person based on who they themselves are in my opinion is not ableist but actually ensuring nobody ends up in a toxic situation. Also it goes both ways: I wouldn't recommend to mentally ill people to date certain types of people either. So I agree with this but again, I think it depends on context because being in a psych ward or having a particular condition is not enough to say whether someone is a danger or risk. Toxic situations can occur with anyone. Obviously, certain mental health conditions can create certain kinds of problems (generally) but not necessarily on an individual basis. Like any generalisation, evaluations of risk that fail to look at individual circumstances can marginalise people. To go back to my original point, the severity of someones condition matters, not to mention how their condition manifests. I don't think it is fair to assume risk solely on the basis that someone has x condition or that they have been in ward. As I said, I have worked in mental health. I have definitely come across people who I do think would be toxic in a relationship, but then I've also come across many that I don't think would be. Generalising statements about the risks posed by a particular condition devoid of accounting for how illness manifests in a person who is ableist, so much so that if a mental health professional in the UK was to make such statements, they could lose their job. It is reducing someone to a condition that is ableist because it reduces everyone withe th said condition to particular traits that are deemed risky. Edit: as someone who has suffered from anxiety and depression, I have personally found relationship with other people that have suffered such things be less toxic because quite often, there has been an understanding, awareness and empathy that is not always present in people who have not suffered such things. I'm not saying that mental health issues should not be considered, I'm just rejecting generalisations of what consitutes a toxic or non-toxic relationship on the basis of a condition detached from any consideration of the people involved because conditions do not define people that way.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Ok, it seems we agree on more things that I thought. I think i took your initial comment too literally. Due to the limited information we had and your general statement about not dating people on psych wards, I assumed that your position on dating people with mental health conditions was general rather than person specific. If the dating advice you would give would consider the people involved and not just whether they have x condition or have been in y institution, I totally agree.  gt;I think here lies our biggest misunderstanding. I do NOT think mentally ill people are toxic in relationships. I in general am not a fan of labelling PEOPLE toxic. But in the combination mentally ill person/unstable sensitive person I think the probability of the relationship turning toxic, which is nobodies fault but a complex dynamic with its own head, is higher. You are right. My comment was poorly worded. It isn #8217;t the person who is toxic but the circumstance. I actually agree with you here, although in line with my other comments, I would say that in order to give dating advice, we would need know more than someone #8217;s condition and where they have been.  gt; Rightfully so, health professionals should not give dating advice anyways so I don't get why they would say it in the first place. I think you are taking my statement as a security warning when I just meant it as dating advice. It's something I would say to my best friend if I knew she was unstable, not to all humanity in a formal letter. Sorry, I should have been clearer here. I wasn #8217;t speaking specifically about dating advice but rather generalising statements about people with a particular condition. However, in terms of dating, even a comment on social media outside of work could get someone fired.  gt;That is interesting. I myself have anxiety and have suffered from depression and I have to say while I received understanding from people with the condition I also need someone to physically help me in those situations and someone who also has anxiety probably couldn't. Like I get really anxious when running errands because of sensory overload and people. Having my boyfriend with me who knows what I am experiencing and who is stable enough to just take me home is key for me. Someone who is unstable might not be able to always do that. It is great that you have someone like this. Again, I #8217;m not saying that having someone with the same condition is necessary for understanding and empathy but rather that in my experience, it has helped. I think our diverging experiences of this just illustrate why there is no correct piece of advice on what works and what doesn #8217;t without considering the people involved and thinking beyond whether someone has x illness or not.  gt; I do want to say, I do appreciate and consider all your points and I do have to say it made me aware I might want to give all this another think. I started this comment just having my own experience and my own "dating intuition" and that's obviously what I would tell my friends who ask for advice too. But I tank you for giving me a more generalized perspective. No problem at all. I #8217;ve enjoyed talking to you and it #8217;s interesting here how our experiences on this stuff differs. It #8217;s hard to give advice without drawing on our own experience but I think with mental health, it can be so complicated and varied, that one what works for one person doesn #8217;t for another.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I'd argue that while much mainstream porn is objectifying, porn can also be subjectifying. For example, queer scholars such as Mowlabocus and Dyer, and feminist scholars such as Linda Williams, while criticising issues with a lot of porn in terms of forms of objectification that emerge around race and gender, also speak about how porn has offered representation to LGBTQ+ people whose sexualities are desexualised and pathologised in much mainstream media and culture at large. They problematise pro porn advocates for being uncritical about porn representation and consumption but at the same time problematise anti-porn advocates for failing to consider how porn enables and displaces different things for different groups. Gay male porn for instance, while problematic in lots of ways, exceeds the heterosexual male gaze. For many, see such sexualities validate through porn plays enables them to develop sexual agency. Edit: I should have probably mentioned that for lesbian porn, it is more complicated, with queer women often fetishised for a male gaze, although Linda Williams does speak about porn made by and for queer women that disrupts this. There is also some literature on queer women and straight women watching gay male porn because it escapes aspects of the male gaze they are objectified by, and enables them to gaze without feeling they are objectified</TEXT>

I think Linda Williams talks about this as serving the rhetoric of all women being sexually available to men, that lesbians are only sexy if their sexuality is open to men. I read somewhere that this is why representations of queer women tend to be more fluid, less lesbian, while representations of queer men are more often always gay, hardly ever bisexual, because a bisexual man comes too close to threatening hetero/homo binary that masculinity often capitalises on. I think this is why queer men have historically been made hypervisible to see and deal with the threat, while queer women have been erased, under the assumption that women have no sexuality of their own</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I was thinking of this, but I was also thinking about some the intersectional literature on how affluent women have historically gained access to certain class and racial privileges through their passivity to men. Beverley Skeggs talks about how middle-class feminities have historically been constructed against working-class women perceived as less feminine. Assimilating with heteropatriarchal expectations has afforded affluent women with access to status and respectability denied to working-class women and woman of colour, and has even been used by middle-class women to denigrate women as less feminine, undesirable, promiscuous, crude etc as means of justifying class and racial privilege. I think sometimes, the bargain goes beyond women negotiating power against men but also can extend negotiating power over other marginalised groups.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>As a former sex worker, I reject your assertion that it is automatically tied to exploitation. It certainly can be and often is but it is not inherently so, not anymore that literally most jobs. As Karl Marx argued, the masses prostitute their bodies for labour all the time. Now I anticipate some people to say selling my body for labour is not the same but that is not their decision to make. Personally, I consider someone paying say a cleaner minimum wage far more exploitative and entitled than any of my old clients. When I sold my body for sex, it was less exploitative than my former job in a call centre. I wouldn't say I was particularly empowered by sex work but I was certainly empowered relative to my call centre position and disempowered by all those that passed judgment and told me I shouldn't be doing it. They were happy to see me exploited by my entitled call centre employer while passing judgment on clients that actually paid what I asked them to and didn't often push for more than I was to happy to offer. I was able to pick and choose who I worked with, and i certainly didn't allow people to do whatever they wanted with me. Meanwhile, at the former call centre, I was forced to non-consensually interact with privileged entitled ******* all day everyday for an ok wage but far less than I earned working for myself. Edit: my clients weren't always entitled. If they were, they wouldn't have felt the need to pay me and respect my boundaries.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>If I wasn't getting paid, no, but then, it was still choice. I didn't have to do sex work. The difference between my earnings from sex work and my earnings elsewhere went on stuff i didn't actually need but wanted. I was single, had no kids, and lived in a relatively cheap city, so there were other jobs i could have done. However, i wanted to be self-employed, set my own price for my labour rather than have an employer extract surplus from it, and choose my clients rather have an employer force me to interact with anyone. This thread can't really be about 'simply sex work' because sex for work and consumption does not exist outside of other forms of work and consumption. The decision to sell or consume sex operates within, not outside, consumer capitalism. Sex work doesn't exist in a vacuum. When making a decision of whether sex work in empowering or not, that decision should be considered in relation to the socio-economic system it operates and other forms of work and consumer choices available. The problem I have with anti-sex work narratives, whether focusing on selling or consuming, is that they overlook the voices of actual sex workers 99% of the time, which is kind of ironic considering that the people speaking over sex workers lived experience have no issue using terms like 'mansplaining'. I also feel that it is unfair to discuss sex work independently of other forms of labour because the decision of whether to do it or not does not exist outside of other forms of labour. Separating sex work out from other any other form of labour consumed or produced implies that it is worse than other forms of consumption and production, especially given that the people doing it are investing this discussion into discussing a market that is often already heavily stigmatised and in many places criminalised. I mean, nobody is posting scathing critiques of feminists employing say a cleaner for their house, even though that form of labour exploitation is state sanctioned. Such discussion in my opinion operate to disempower sex workers by removing and stigmatising only \*some\* work and consumer choices.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>No problem :-). I have no issue with sex work being discussed as part of a wider critique of labour or in terms of issues of exploitation that do often arise within the industry. It's just universal claims that treat sex work differently to other forms of labour I take issue with. For example, I have a feminist friend who is quite anti-sex work while employing a cleaner. She pays the cleaner more than minimum and is better than a lot of employers but given the choice between doing what her cleaner does and doing sex work, I'd personally choose sex work because I would feel less exploited. My friend happily employing a cleaner while telling sex workers that they are being exploited for me is huge entitlement. She feels entitled to peoples bodies for labour for an ok but still not great salary but objects to people paying people like me way more for sex work. Don't get me wrong, I understand that people relate to sex and intimacy very differently so I'm not about to suggest that everyone who works on minimum wage would be better off and empowered by sex work, but some people are</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I mean, I #8217;m not sure the rapist should be allowed to raise the child. I #8217;m not advocating for forced abortion but if they choose to give birth, I think the child should be given up for adoption. I don #8217;t think it #8217;s healthy for a child to grow up with someone who conceived them through rape. However, if the child was to stay with the parent, I don #8217;t see how a person who is raped is anymore responsible for child support than any other random person. If I can consensually donate sperm without being liable for child support, I sure as hell don #8217;t expect to be liable when my sperm is stolen from me. It would be a punishment because the victim would be singled out for bearing responsibility for something that is no more their choice than anyone else. It would be worse than running a lottery for some random person to pay because not only are they being forced to pay for something that literally had nothing to do with them but they also have that on top of the trauma of being raped. That said, I do support child support from the state, and I think that taxpayers money should support single parents that are struggling in general. Edit: it just occurred to me that the rapist would have the right to give up financial responsibility to the state by giving the child up for adoption so perhaps that is the best option under such scenarios.</TEXT>

As you say, child support is not a punishment, but I feel that support should never be demanded from people that do not consent to sex. I think the rapist and/or the state should always bear responsibility for supporting the child financially. The way I see it is that if I have to pay a bit more tax to cover support for kids born under such terrible circumstances, it is completely fair because I bear no less responsibility for that that child being born than the person raped.</TEXT>

Although white women may also share this experience when they date outside their race. Yes, I #8217;ve heard this before. The black feminist Patricia Elliot talks about this but does mention a racial difference in that when women of colour are pressured not to date white men, it #8217;s because they are othered as race traitors, whereas when white men do it, it #8217;s because they racist. Obviously, such control over women #8217;s bodies is sexist either way but I guess discomfort around inter-racial relationships from groups that have experienced long histories of racial oppression is perhaps more understandable, not that it validates such behaviour or anything.</TEXT>

    <TITLE>I was wondering what everyone's thoughts are on this AITA thread about a woman who didnt respect her bf's sexual privacy.</TITLE>
    <DATE>2020-05-27 12:14:37</DATE>
    <TEXT>Before I start, I just want to say that I actually agree with the verdict that the redditor was an arsehole. As a gay man, I feel sexual privacy is very important, and I think it was a really shit move of the gf to try and use fragile masculinity as an excuse to validate overstepping boundaries. I mean, some people could say that I was too fragile to come as gay but navigating sexualities against sexual oppression is challenging, and I don't think people should be forced to disclose such private aspects they are not yet comfortable dislosing and that could harm their relationships. Anyway, aside from that, I still felt there was something missing from this thread. Absolutely everyone jumped on this woman as if it was the worst thing she could have ever done, but how is this any different from the countless guys that tell their mates in the pub about what they do to women. Her bf may not be that kind of man but I would definitely be curious to know whether he has spoke about what he has done to women because if he has and he thinks it is ok, the only difference between that and what she did would be fragile masculinity. While pegging is considered a kink, it is arguably only perceived that way because it goes against masculine expectations. When men give anal, it isn't considered this way and I have heard many men brag about about women they've 'done up the arse'. Edit: just to clarify, I agree she is an AH. I am not defending her actions. I am just asking whether people feel that men are held to the same unanimous condemnation for doing the same thing to women. https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/gqln9a/aita_for_telling_my_boyfriend_his_masculinity_was/?utm_medium=android_app amp;utm_source=share</TEXT>

There's nothing wrong with being gay, but if your friend is gay, you don't go around telling people because you know that: Exactly, this is why I said I agree that she is an arshole.

There was also a similar thread on AITA some time back where guys said his gf was pissed because he had shared stuff with his friend who they both knew. However, that guy was not condemned anyway near as harshly. While overall, most said he was the AH, there were so many men defending it as lad talk and saying his only mistake was telling her about it.

When I was 19, I was dating a 32 year old, and in terms of power dynamics, I don't feel there was any imbalance, even though I'm aware that there certainly can be. That said, I'm gay, so there was no gender imbalance. However, I do have a feminist female friend who dated someone 10 years older in her early twenties. Again, there was no power imbalance. If anything, she had more power in their relationship because she was the higher earner, while he stayed him with their kid and was economically dependant on her. I feel a universal rule on how much of on age gap is acceptable for consenting adults at an individual level is problematic, but as others have said, I think issues that can be addressed are structural biases around men being more likely to date older and also the fact that older men often repeatedly look for going people.

    <TEXT> gt;I see signs of PTSD Sorry but she was very calm until she was on the phone to the police. She was clearly not being threatened, and she knew it when she *threatened* him saying 'I will call the cops and tell them you're an African Anerican'. She obviously wasn't afraid of him because she had refused to put her dog on a leash and had already been confrontational prior to her entire performance. She blatantly lied, as a white person, who would have known black men have been shot for far less.Given what the cops do to black men in the US, if anyone had become triggered by PTSD in that whole scenario, I would have expected it to be him. I showed this video to my mum who is a psychiatric nurse and the only thing she saw was a white woman capitalising on sexist assumptions that white women are fragile and defenseless to harm people of colour. This phenenonmon is nothing new. Middle class white women have been doing this to working-class people and people of colour for centuries. Beverley Skeggs writes a lot about it. The only thing my mum said is that Cooper looks like she could have NPD, which, while sometimes entangled in PTSD, does not appear to be triggered by PTSD in this scenario. I don't think the punishment was harsh. Perhaps in a America but here in the UK, people have been fired for far less. People have been sacked here for using racist words, and rightly so. What she did could have literally had him killed. The punishment fits the crime. She abused her white privilege, she lost some of it.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Yes, a friend of mine. It was mostly down to ignorance. He had legitimate concerns about a few things that negatively impact men but failed to see how feminism addressed his concerns. After sharing some feminist literature addressing the issues he raised and talking to him about how the biases men may encounter also disadvantage women (I.e. paternity rights and employment discrimination both being grounded in the assumption that women will or should have/ care for children), his perspective changed. I think another issue was that the gender dynamics often discussed in mainstream feminism are biased towards middle-class white construction of gender, which didn't fully speak to him as a working-class man or working-class women he knew, but after sharing some black and socialist feminist literature addressing intersections of class, he was able to acknowledge the nuances of his gender privilege and class oppression.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Sorry for taking a while to respond. I was having a few drinks when you messaged and completely forgot to get back to you. Anyway, in answer to your question, I would say it depends. Predatory older gay guys that consistently only chase younger guys are often considered the same as straight guys who do the same. Where I would say it differs is in attitudes towards bigger age gaps that emerge more spontaneously. As I said, with my ex and I, neither of us were specifically looking for older or younger, it just happened. We got a long and had lots in common so decided to give it a go. If anything, he was more reluctant about the age gap at first (13 years) but it was never an issue. I was quite mature for my age and he was quite young for his. I think a big difference with the gay community is that LGBTQ spaces tend to be quite mixed in terms of age because we have limited spaces to go. Also, with a lot less gay men having kids, I find that it's a lot more common for older gay guys to still have an active social life in bars and clubs, which means that in our community, there are often more opportunities for getting to know people who are significantly older/younger compared to many straight bars and clubs that tend to attract more age-specific markets. One issue within the gay community is that there are predatory older men, especially online, looking to take advantage of young gay guys who are often closeted, alienated, and desperate for a bit of attention. When I was 15, I was wanking off on cam for guys in their 30s, and this is not uncommon. Lots of young gay guys have done it. However, it isn't accepted. The reason I would say it is common is not because it's more normalised but because young gay guys are far less likely to be able to explore their sexuality with peers so they end up in adult spaces looking for attention that heterosexuals youths may otherwise get at school etc. The way I see it is if young girls were not able to express any interest in boys at schools and went on chatrooms etc looking to talk to boys anonymously, there would also be loads of predatory older straight or bisexual men looking to exploit that.</TEXT>

She didn't want to criminalised homosexuality but that doesn't mean she thought it was ok. She also, as you mentioned, implemented section 28, which was basically the equivalent of Russians gay propaganda law but in schools. That is enough to qualify as homophobic.  gt;She also helped avert the AIDS crisis in the gay community, which was rampant in the USA, by promoting safe sex and starting needle exchange programmes. No, she back down after shit loads of tensions with aids activists. People had to fight her for this. I know.

    <TEXT>But isn't evaluating consent within such practices a form of criticism? I'm a submissive gay guy who gets off on stuff like this but when I play with things that might ordinarily be considered violent, I am giving power, not having power taken from me. I feel like this is a massively important distinction. As a sub, I am not actually being dominated because I am only dominated in ways that I choose to be. This is often referred to as the sub paradox. Meanwhile my partner gets off on doing it because I'm aroused. If he was taking power away from me, he wouldn't be aroused, which makes it massively different from a scenario where someone is actually violent. I'm pretty sure my kinks do emerge from problematic power structures. I was bullied a lot in school for being gay and I feel I've sexualised that somehow. However, I was reading a paper recently on the distinction between trauma reenactment and trauma play. Trauma reenactment would involve reliving the past, satisfying my desires with actual abusive people. However, trauma play is about taking the thing which was problematic and using it in a safe space with a partner you can trust. It's about creating a scenario where I am able to play with problematic power dynamics that once hurt me in a way that puts me and my desires in the driving seat. Doing so involves a lot of care and trust. Personally, as a sub, I find that my perfect match is not a sadist who puts their own desires and pleasures above others but rather someone who gets off on being dominant *in response to* my needs. I think people should critically engage with kinks but for me, it's often a question of how they are practiced and with who as opposed to practicing or not.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>That's true. I wasn't saying that criticism was wrong. I was saying that talking about dynamics of consent within such scenarios isn't just accepting them with no criticism. Accepting them with no criticism would involve ignoring the nuances of how they are practiced, why, for who, when etc. As someone who is into kinks, I personally don't think television is the right place to broadcast this stuff because it's going to be extremely limited in its ability grapple with the nuances of how such kinks can be practiced safely and respectfully. However, I disagree that such kinks are inherently violent. I've experienced violence with people that have taken power from me, and I've experienced being dominated by people I've given power to. I really do not think that the guys I've played have been capable of actually hurting me</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Hey, sorry I meant to get back to you to say thanks for this response. I actually deleted the original post because it seemed that some people might have read it as suggesting people have a right to sex, which I agree they don't. It was more on sex being a privilege that I was struggling with. I agree with what you said. I guess acknowledging it is a privilege doesn't have to mean a lack of empathy for those who, through no fault of their own, struggle to develop intimate connection. Obviously those that struggle to develop intimacy because of the way they treat people are a different matter entirely. As for your comment about queer people killing themselves, from personal experience of homophobia, I would say it can be a bit of both. Obviously, shame is a huge part of it, but for me, that shame limited my willingness to date other guys, and the lack of intamcy definitely factored into my struggle, although, as you say, it wasn't just about sex. Anyway, I just wanted to let you know that I read your message and took on board what you said :)</TEXT>

    <TEXT>As I said to someone else, I can't really comment on that because I'm fortunate enough to live in a country with universal healthcare so I do not know how rational I would be under such circumstances. I would like to say that I would be rational about it and deal with it because I agree that not doing so could make things worse, but then I have never faced such a dillema. From what I've heard, dealing with health issues in the US is enough to make many families bankrupt and create issues for future employment, and even then their is no guarantee that money won't run out and the health issue will be left unresolved. I'd also be concerned about the conflict of interest. I would trust a diagnosis far more in Europe than in the US knowing that my doctor doesn't profit from treatment. The OP said her husband has conspiracy theory ideas about healthcare but if she is in the US, it wouldn't surprise me if her husbands concerns around healthcare are not the same concerns that most people have in Europe about private healthcare.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Well said. The idea that it is weird or predatory for a man to want kids is really harmful. This is often something that is used against gay male couples. I remember someone once saying to me (a gay man) that they could understand 2 women wanting kids but not 2 men. Aside from the blatant homophobia, I found that incredibly misogynistic.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I mean surely that depends on the guy. I'm gay. Does that mean it would only be iffy if I adopted a 17 year old boy? And if so, what about all the queer men that have adopted and taken in (officially or otherwise ) LGBT teenagers disowned from their families? I get safeguarding measures need to be in place but I dont think we should be stigmatising anyone adopting based on gender and/or sexual orientation. There are plenty of reasons why someone may choose to adopt or foster an older child.</TEXT>

Why is he expected to take responsibility for that misunderstanding and hand over beer that he paid for? He didn't get angry with her, he simply took *his* beer. The entitled response after not getting the only thing they wanted him for says it all. Misunderstanding or not, why should he pay for their beer? It's sounds like they were deliberately trying to use him for their own personal gain, with no regard for his feelings, and it backfired. He didn't get angry, he just refused to be a doormat.

    <TEXT>"The government #8217;s new #160;domestic abuse bill #160;has been roundly condemned by campaigners for not recognising the  #8220;gendered nature #8221; of #160;domestic violence #160;and failing to address a  #8220;raft of cuts #8221; to service" Wanting a bill that recognises the gendered nature of domestic violence does not mean not recognising that men experience domestic violence. It is entirely possible to have a bill that both recognises domestic violence as a gendered issue while supporting male victims. While the article doesn't say anything about specific gendered training, it also doesn't say anything about letting female perpetrators of violence off the hook. What it does say is that campaigners want the gendered nature of such violence to be acknowledged, which could well include everything I have mention. The idea that they want to legalise violence against men is something you have pulled that out of thin air. However, for arguments sake, let's say you are right and that this is an expression of evil nasty feminism. To that I would urge you to carefully read through every comment on this thread because every feminist here has said that they support female perpetrators being held accountable. Regardless of what some people opposing that bill may or may not think, it is quite clear from this subreddit that a great many feminists support male victims.</TEXT>

There is one in Norway with a 70% rehabilitation rate because it focuses heavily on rehabilitation and treats the prisoners like human beings. However, they are still incarcerated. I fail to see how we go about rehabilitating a serial rapist and murderer without some form of incarceration to make sure they a) attend necessary therapy/sessions to aid rehabilitation and b) protect people from them until we think they have actually been rehabilitated. I agree with abolish prisons for 90% of crimes but not for everything edit: I initially wrote 70% reoffending but I mean rehabilitation rate</TEXT>

I have heard both ideas expressed by transphobes but more often than not, it is the former rather than the latter.  gt;Also, is there a radfem offshoot that doesn't include the trans-hate or is the trans-hate part of an offshoot? Definitely. In fact, I don't consider TERFs are radical feminists. Radical feminism aims to restructure society, unlike liberal feminism which fights for equal opportunities and inclusion in an already biased system. I would argue that trans exclusionary radical feminists are not radical feminists because in reducing people to the genitals they are born with, they are reinforcing existing structures of oppression.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Sorry, I mean they have 70% rehabilitation rate, not reoffending rate, although from what you said it's even better. I'll edit my original comment.  gt;I think the key phrase here is "some form of incarceration". I believe there's a slight, but important, difference between incarceration and seclusion from society. One can imagine a scenario (in the most severe cases) where that person is removed from society, removed from the possibility of reoffending for a time while being rehabilitated, while still retaining their rights as a citizen and a human being. In that case, I have no issue with what prison abolitionists are arguing, but I have never seen this made explicit. If this is the case, I would support changes. Edit: I should mention that im not from the US. We also have issues with capitalist interests in prisons here in Europe (with the exception of Norway) but it is a lot less extreme. Still, I would prefer our system here in the UK to adopt a Nordic approach, or perhaps even something better.</TEXT>

My uncle grew up gay in 70s. I am far more privileged than he was, yet he is less sensitive to micro aggressions. I think that's understandable and shouldn't be labelled privileged.

    <TEXT>As a gay man, I would argue that you are possibly the AH but I would say more info is needed. Had the Christian boys expressed homophobic beliefs, and if so, did your daughters attack on Christianity make room for Christians that are not homophobic? If not, I think that you (and her ) are the AHs for two reasons. Firstly, you would be tarring all Christians with the same brush. Ireland is a catholic majority country that voted for gay marriage in a referendum, something which far less Christian nations are yet to get behind. Not all chsitrians are homophobic. Secondly, while I'm all for criticising the church as an institution, like any institution, I feel that generalising statements about followers are counterintuitively part of the problem of homophobia because what we end up with is atheists, like religious leaders, telling followers that the only way to be a Christian and believe in God is to subscribe to homophobic readings of religious dogma. Convincing someone who believes in God that God does not exist is much harder that convincing them to rethink how they read and express religion . For me, as a gay man and an athiest, seeing religious followers stand up and reject homophobia within their relgion is something to be celebrated because it opens up possibilties for religion to be expressed differently. While i do not have faith, i know that many have and will continue to have so for me, these conversations about different ways of expressing religion are important for LGBTQ rights. Edit: the idea that boys should just man up in response to being bullied make YTA.</TEXT>

That didn't help me and it doesn't help other LGBTQ people growing up with Christianity. Edit: ironically, the whole man up thing is often used to justify the bullying of gay men</TEXT>

    <TEXT> gt;Yes, but the vast majority of Christianity (looking at number of sects, taking into account size of the sect) is hostile to feminism  amp; LGBT folk. I don't dispute that. I'm queer myself and I was raised Catholic so I know this first hand. My point is simply that despite issues with Christianity as instituion, people interpret, negotiate and embody relgious teachings in different ways so it is possible for people to be both queer/feminist and Christian. As I say, I'm an atheist but I have queer feminist Muslim and Christian friends. They also acknowledge issues within the way their religions have become institutionalised . However, they see the problem as entangled in patriarchy and not definitive of what Christianity could be. I feel that generalising statements about religion can easily end up fuelling atheist bigotry. I'm not too concerned about Christianity because Christians are not marginalised where I am from. However, such failure to recognise how different people embody and express religion doesn't just effect Christians, it also fuels a lot of Islamophobia in my country, which aside from being hateful towards the many Muslim people here that support feminist and LGBTQ communities, completely throws LGBTQ and feminist muslims under the bus. I'm all for criticising religious institutions but the comment i was responding to seem to imply Christian women couldnt be feminist because it equated being christian with being a republican. While many christians ate republican, unlike republicans , they are not all Republicans Edit: it's also worth bearing in mind that some heavily Christian countries (Ireland) have better LGBTQ rights than some countries that considerably less religious</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I recommend maybe reading some black/intersection@) feminism that decentres white affluent women. Bell hooks is great. I can recommend her book *Feminism is for everybody* and she has loads of videos on YouTube. I haven't read/heard her talk about women outside of the US but as someone said, that may be because she is focusing on stuff that she can change. Also, when white feminists in the west focus on things happening in other countries, it can cause more harm because white women in the west are not in a position to understand the complexity of those women's experiences. I see it all the time in queer politics. I'm a gay man and I often see gay men discuss how we need to deal with homophobia in non-western countries but these discussions often come at cost of speaking oner the perspectives of LGBTQ people living in those countries. People in the west defining what oppression looks like and how it should be resisted for people in other countries is a form of oppression. One thing we can be sure about is that nearly everyone in the world already knows what the West thinks not just about feminism but about everything because have been inserting ourselves into everything for centuries</TEXT>

    <TEXT>No problem. It's a good introduction to feminism.  gt;And also understand the angle that you're coming from when you mentioned the negatuve impacts of a westerner getting involved in the social movements or other countries and how that may come across as "imperialistic" (without the use of a better word) Yes, it's a tough one because on the one hand, we see something that is unjust and want to help but on the other, we are not in a position to offer practical aolutions. We can listen and donate money but that's about it. To give a more concrete (none feminist) example. I am also from the UK and recently there has been some news on homophobia in Poland. Lots of LGBTQ people in the UK have been saying the EU should throw Poland out because of this, but then what about LGBTQ people in Poland, would they be happy with this because such a decision would affect them just as it affects the homophobes? Given that a lot of the homophobia in Poland comes from pro-russian segments of the population, kicking them out of the EU could actually make life harder for LGBTQ Poles as it would likely result in them developing even stronger ties with Russia. Quite often, even in out genuine desire to help, we can make things worse. Edit: and imperialism sums it up perfectly :-)</TEXT>

    <TEXT>NTA. As a gay man, I wish my father had said something like this when I was younger. It's interesting how your wife thinks what you said is encouraging him to be gay while thinking what she said isn't encouraging him to be straight. Why is he too young to know he's gay but not too young to know he's straight? That double standard right there is homophobic. I think you suck slightly for crossing boundaries that made your son uncomfortable but IMO your wife sucks more. The first time you brought it up was great for two reasons. Firstly, if he is gay or realises he is gay later , he will know he has a father that loves him unconditionally. Unfortunately, he may not feel the same about his mum, especially not if he overheard her making such a big deal about you encouraging him to be gay *after* after she had asked him about having a gf. Secondly, even if he isn't gay, you taught him an important lesson (one your wife is yet to learn), which is that we shouldn't assume people's sexuality and the possibility of being gay should be treated as just as normal. As for the 2nd time you confronted him, this is where i think you suck a tiny bit because he was clearly already uncomfortable. That said, had I been in your shoes, I would have probably done the same. Given that your wife had already clearly shown that she saw him having a bf as something different to having gf, i would have probably wanted to reassure my son that he had at least one parent that didn't feel that way. That little but of discomfort now is something that could be life saving later on.</TEXT>

I think the way they expressed it could have been better. They shouldn't have told her what she can and can't do. They could have said that they couldn't share a bed with her if she hadn't showered, and maybe suggested a back up plan like separate beds for the times she doesn't want to.

For me, failing to bring this up before they moved in together makes his a slight arsehole but depending where his head was at, could have been innocent enough. However, for me, what makes him a big AH is the way he expressed it, essentially telling her what she can and can't do and kicking her put of bed. That is controlling behaviour.

    <TEXT> gt;Do you think it's an entitled white people issue or more of a conservative vs liberal issue? I'd say it's both because white people are more likely to be conservative. However, it varies from place to place. Here in the UK (and across many countries in Europe) many haven't been wearing the masks, left and right. The issue is that they become ineffective if everyone isn't wearing them because while they are good at preventing the virus getting out, they are significantly less efficient when it comes to letting the virus in. At least, that is what I've been told. I'm happy to stand corrected. I believe this is why some countries in Europe (Slovakia and The Czech Republic) have made masks mandatory in any public space. Slovakia has only had 28 deaths (and it's stayed that way for months), so whatever they've been doing clearly works.</TEXT>

I don't always sleep with my partner because we have different schedules and suffer from insomnia on nights he comes to bed much later.

    <TEXT>As someone else said, nobody is expecting you to make yourself a martyr. In fact, as a gay man, I would specifically ask that you do not make yourself a martyr because if you were to say lose your job over challenging your boss, then that would be one less ally in your workplace. The only thing you would have achieved is losing your job. I'd recommend that you pick your battles and modify how you call people out (or call in) depending on who you are speaking to. You may not call your boss out on everything that you would call say a colleague or friend out on. If you do call out a boss, you may do it differently. A tool I find useful is to call people in with questions. That said, as a working class gay man, I'm a little conscious of the fact that you may also be from a working class background because of your comment about not attending a prestigious school. If that is the case, I wanted to mention that being a white cis heterosexual man does not put you in the most privileged position in society because class marginalisation is just as real as any other form of marginalisation. Personally, I have faced more struggles (both internally and externally) as a result of my class background than my sexuality. In my country, class is heavily embodied, communicated through things like dialect. Even though I have been to University and have a good reasonably paid job, i still feel like i have to prove myself more than my colleagues that were born into privileged economic posititions because the way i talk and express myself is not taken as seriously. From what you descibred, you face something similar in relation to where you went to college. That may put you in a less privileged position to call out your boss than say one of your Ivy League colleagues.</TEXT>

I disagree with the ESH judgement because I don't think that disowning people that are homophobic or transphobic is an arsehole move. After all, it isn't LGBTQ that are making the decision to start excluding family members. Such toxic relationships can end up causing people a lot of harm so I think people caught up in them have to decide whether it's worth trying to work through them or not. That said, I haven't downvoted you because you are coming at this from an experience I cannot relate to.

The point that a man is trying to explain something to a woman even if it is something he hasn #8217;t experienced (like pregnancy) or even if she has more expertise (like a male customer that won #8217;t talk to a female mechanic) From listening to women, I agree men are significantly more likely to engage in such behaviour but is it exclusive to men? Perhaps i'm misunderstanding the term but it seems to me that in our post-truth society, a sizeable population of all genders, particularly cishet men and cishet women, think they have more expertise than experts across many fields. I have a friend who is a doctor who has spoke about both men and women explain the dangers of vaccines to him. Also, as a gay man, I have had cishet straight men and women heterosplain my sexuality to me.

My advice to you to avoid all possible confusion would be to just give up on sex because judging my your responses, chances are you are going to end up assaulting someone if you haven't already. In all seriousness, if you are not trolling, I'm also wondering whether you even have the capacity to give consent yourself because these are pretty basic boundaries that you are unable to grasp. I often see men complaining about how confusing the 'mindfield' of consent is. I usually disagree but judging by your comments on this thread, consent may just be too hard for you to understand right now. You certainly have a lot learn. I would seek out professional help and then maybe come back to considering your ability to safely navigate social and sexual boundaries at a later date</TEXT>

    <TEXT> gt;The message I feel like I'd be sending there is "Be yourself, embrace your identity, ignore what society expects from you and just live your life... iiiiif you're literally the strongest person in the room. Otherwise, bow down and play your assigned role As a gender non-conforming man that is not particularly physically strong, I wouldn't see it this way. While your physical strength may afford some privilege in enabling you to do this, people like you doing it makes it easier for people like me because you are still challenging gender expectations. Also, I think the emotional strength it takes to do something like this transcend physical strength. If I'm honest, I tend to play down my queerness outside of queer spaces and it isn't just because I feel physically threatened so regardless of your physical strength, I take my hat off to you embracing your true self without giving a fuck what people think.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>And why would you need to punch back? If you are unable to restrain the person until you can leave and report them , then yes, maybe it would be necessary for self defence. Personally , I would push them away and then make an exit but if I was trapped and in danger of being repeatedly hit with no way of overpowering the person to escape, I would fight back *but only to* free myself of the situation. As others have said, reasonable force for self defence is not the same as retaliation, both morally and legally . In my country, excessive force is actually a crime, although in some countries it seems that this is not the case. For example, in the US, certain states seem to define self defence in a way that would be considered excessive and by extension criminal across much of Europe.</TEXT>

In 1951, she was asked whether she was a woman and her response was:  #8220;You seem to assume that every person is either a man or a woman #8230;. Each person is actually both in varying degrees #8230; I am more woman than I am man #8221; (Meyerowitz 2004, p.7). Obviously lots of people do not consider themselves both but plenty on non-binary and gender queer people do. As others have said, your confusion right now may be a result of working through the societal expectations telling you that you are not a woman, but it may be that you are neither a man or woman or both .</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Yes, some feminists can certainly have that attitude. I think it happens where patriarchy is seen as a product of men and masculinity as opposed to something perpetuated by everyone (even though the result is that it benefits some more than others) . Boys are raised and taught by people of all genders and sexualities so for me , it #8217;s nonsensical to reduce men to product of other men.

    <TEXT>I personally adopt a Foucauldian position on power, popular among post-structural feminists and queer theorists. Foucault saw power as something more complex than something any given person or group has or doesn #8217;t have. His focus was on power relations emerging between people and groups , which is always shifting across time and place. I think this important for being able to account for intersectionality, for example, making sense of the complex power dynamics between a working class black man and an affluent white woman, but I also think it #8217;s important for considering how we are all entangled in (and contribute to) systems of oppression, even when those systems operate against us. This might sound abstract so to ground it in something, take patriarchy for instance. Some understand patriarchy as men exerting power over women. However, post-structuralists see patriarchy as something produced by everyone (to varying degrees), even though it benefits men and historically did emerge through more direct force. For example, women telling boys not to cry and policing other women for failing to live up to certain standards of femininity re-produces patriarchy.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I don #8217;t have a specific answer but I just wanted to point out that the issues that are lesser known do not necessarily correlate with what is being discussed within feminism. I am a queer feminist PhD student working on working class masculinity, particular working class queer masculinity. My supervisor, a well known feminist, also does a lot of work on working class masculinity. I have presented my work and feminist conferences and only ever had supportive feedback from women. I would say that at least a quarter of the research being conducted in the gender studies department I am a part of is focused on men and masculinity from a feminist perspective, yet the media has us believe that feminists never consider men. There is also a lot research and activism around various intersectional struggles but again, much of the media would have use believe that feminists spend all day everyday complaining about manspreading and mansplaining. While such issues rightfully piss off most feminists I know, they don #8217;t even begin to scratch the surface of the issues they are discussing. Depending on the media you follow, it #8217;s possible that the things you think feminists are discussing the most are actually the things that are being discussed the least.</TEXT>

It looks at gender in relation to deindustrialization in an impoverished towns in South Wales (UK). There is a specific focus on struggles with a loss of masculinity in those areas, with lots of young men shamed by both men and women for failing to live up to expressions of masculinity which are no longer possible. They focus a lot on the stigma surrounding men doing service work despite the fact that there is no other work and high unemployment. One of the participants was even bullied by his mother to quite his job.</TEXT>

I really like Stuart Halls work so anything that resonates with him is definitely of interest to me. One book I read was by Ferguson called *Aberrations of race: a queer of colour critique*. It was more materialist than identity based. It draws in intersectionality but I feel it goes beyond it in thinking about how people of colour have had limited material access to the hetero-patriarchal power. For example, he talks about how one of the ways racism has emerged in response to poverty and crime in black neighbourhoods in the US has been through blaming such issues on failures of the family (particularly black mothers).</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Hey, sorry for taking a while to get back to you. I think the main thing I would say about toxic versus positive masculinity is that the former is based on assumptions and social expectations assigned to certain bodies. Positive traits associated with masculinity do not belong to men. I don #8217;t know if you know Jack Halberstam but their book *Female masculinity* is a good example about how women (and enbies) can and often do embody masculine traits. If a man aspire to certain masculine traits, I do not see that as negative unless they see those traits as definitive of what it means to be a man because that is when they start to project their own relationship with gender identity and expression on to others. I would also question what aspiring to certain masculine traits that can be positive like confidence , strength and courage mean. If aspiring to be masculine means rejecting anyone and anything that is feminine, both within and on from others, I wouldn #8217;t consider that positive. After all, any masculinity defined by the absence of certain positive traits associated with femininity, like empathy for example, is going to be harmful. Also, when certain traits like strength and confidence are defined by the absence of any feminine traits, a man counterproductively becomes fragile. I guess it depends what we mean by masculine as well. I think in our very visual-centric culture, there can be a tendency to reduce to positive and negative masculinity down to superficial visual markers like body type etc but in reality, some of the people embodying the most toxic forms of masculinity may not actually present particularly masculine. I have met body builders who are physically very strong and present as very masculine yet have no issue with opening up emotionally to people, identify with feminism, have queer, non-binary and female friends, and are do not define things like strength with having to be in control. Meanwhile , I have met guys that present more feminine that speak over women and queer people all the time, always have to be in control, are aggressive , and struggling to handle their emotions at a cost to both themselves and others. In fact, sometimes I feel it is insecurity around not presenting as masculine that makes them try extra hard to other and distance themselves anything feminine. I am not sure if I #8217;ve fully answered your question but happy to discuss more :)</TEXT>

    <TEXT>My first question to this would be whether or not the guys wanting to trade pics are only interested in sex or whether you assume that is all they are interested in because being open to casual sexual encounters and fun does not mean being closed off to romantic developments. I say this as someone who, when single, has always been often open to multiple possible relationships but as soon as I suggest fun, I have, in many instances, been met with hostile assumptions that this is all I #8217;m after. Some people seem to read  #8216;fun and maybe more #8217; as nothing but fun, which just isn #8217;t the case, at least it hasn #8217;t been for me and it certainly hasn #8217;t been for people I #8217;ve met. The truth is, finding someone that you want to commit to isn #8217;t easy, so i may sleep with quite a few guys before i meet someone i click with, but that doesn #8217;t mean that when I meet someone for fun that this is all I #8217;m after and that something won #8217;t develop. In fact, I #8217;ve had several romantic relationships start this way. From the perspective of those that judge people like me for being open to fun, their assumptions probably end up becoming self-fulfilling because as soon as I sense any kind of sex negative judgement , I run a mile. I only date sex positive people. That doesn #8217;t mean I won #8217;t meat someone who isn #8217;t looking for fun. It depends on how they come across after knowing that it is something I would be up for. That said, it depends on where I am in my life. I know that in the past, I #8217;ve only met guys for fun because I haven #8217;t felt ready for a relationship for whatever reason so meeting people with the aim of anything more seemed like a waste of my and their time. However, again, we are complex beings, and sometimes romance has emerged when I #8217;ve least expected it and haven #8217;t been looking for it from casual encounters .</TEXT>

I am gay and I also think carefully about complex emotions involved in getting with someone close to a friend, and I have female and enby friends (heterosexual and otherwise) lthat do the same. While I reject the bro code in favour of a non gender specific don #8217;t be an arsehole code, I do think dating anyone and everyone without consideration for how those people have hurt people you know and without considering things that may damage a friendship is problematic. It has absolutely nothing to do with ownership. It can be hard enough (even re-traumatising) navigating mutual friends with an ex. When friends in the past have asked me if I would have a problem with them dating an ex of mine, they haven #8217;t done so because they think I own the person in question, they have done so because they don #8217;t want to damage our relationship which understandably matters more. I have one ex that I absolutely would not want to see again, so if a friend wanted to to date them, it would probably end up coming at the cost of our friendship.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I don #8217;t think those things a comparable because this doesn #8217;t just effect your group, it concerns people outside of your group. It #8217;s like having a code in a group that results in you treated white people and people of colour differently outside of the group. Like I said, I agree with some of the reasons you #8217;ve stated for considering certain complications that arise but those complications are nothing to do with gender . You have defended the code but nothing you have said to back it up is exclusive to male friends dating women. As such, I ask you, why would you be ok with a female friend (real of hypothetical) dating your brother but not a male friend dating your sister. If the relationship ended up bad, you could potentially be stuck in the middle and forced to choose between them. If you can give me any specific reason why a male friend dating a sister would be different , I #8217;m all ears but I fail to see it. t from a male friend dating your sister? You can have whatever code you like for yourself but as soon as you a placing such moral expectations on others, you are having an impact on people around you who don #8217;t necessarily subscribe to such strict boundaries or if they do, apply them equally to people irrespective of gender or sexual orientation. If you don #8217;t have any close female friends, fair enough, but hypothetically, if you did, why would you be ok with her dating your brother if you are not ok with a male friend dating your sister? Either way, the relationship could become messy, resulting in you being stuck in the middle and forced to choose. A female friend dating your brother would still be taking a risk that could damage your friendship. As, such, what possible reason is there for feeling differently about a male friend dating your sister to a female friend dating your brother (or a male friend dating your brother/female friend dating your sister).</TEXT>

    <TEXT>As a gay man, I can also relate to this . I #8217;ve dated friends ex #8217;s and friends have dated mine but usually, especially with close friends, this has never been done with discussing it with the friend first. I don #8217;t know if this is the same for you? The reason for discussing it isn #8217;t because we think we own our ex #8217;s but because depending on how things ended , bringing an ex into the social group can create all kinds of problems.

    <TEXT>Ah ok. Sorry. I got confused because you started discussed that it is ok for it to be gendered but what you are describing isn #8217;t gendered because you are not holding men and women to different standards. If such rules are not exclusive to men, I see no issue. I responded to the the comment about lesbians being more fluid with this kind of thing. If I #8217;m honest, so are gay men but I #8217;ve never had a friend just go and date an ex without asking first. As I said before, this isn #8217;t because they need my permission but because they value our friendship. If I #8217;m still getting over an ex, or if an ex hurt men badly or was abusive, the last thing I would want is for them to become a major part of my friendship group so my friends are understandably sensitive to the potential costs of pursuing something without checking in first. I think this is understandable.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Yes, I definitely see your point. I guess the thing I would question in terms of dating preferences is where the desire for masculine men and only masculine men comes from. Our desires are not born in a preference, so I think it #8217;s always worth at least reflecting on. I used to have a very strong preference for masc guys but I don #8217;t now. Some of the reasons why I used to think feminine men were unattractive were rooted it sexist assumptions. That said, I think there is something to be said that we are all part of the sexist homophobic racist culture that we are trying to resist. We all of have biases, and we can work towards understanding where they come from and try to address them, but I guess we never fully eradicate them. I still often find masculine guys more attractive, even though I #8217;ve worked through exclusionary preferences and would date more feminine men Edit: I think that maybe there is a distinction between talking about how our culture fetishises masc guys as more attractive , reinforcing gendered hierarchies, without individualising the problem</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Yes, I agree, although queer activism takes a very strong position against gendered preferences. I guess that maybe there is a difference between having a preference and having a completely exclusionary preference . I #8217;m not sure how much of it is innate and how much of it is socialisation. I personally don #8217;t subscribe much to born this way narratives. However, I reject the idea that socialisation = choice. I think our emerging social-psychological attachments are far more complicated than that. Also, I think we have a tendency to reduce such preferences to some kind of negative cause, I.e. assuming a preference for masc guys is rooted in the idea that feminine expression is shameful for a man. However, it could be that someone is attracted to masculine men not because of negative attitudes towards feminine guys but because such men embody certain traits that they have come to associate with people that they have been close to and have made them feel safe</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Totally. Fragile masculinity can make guys reluctant to do and try lots of things. However, there is a difference between just being masculine and having unhealthy attachments masculinity that prevent us from expressing ourselves in ways we want to. Plenty of masculine men have no issue with being fucked. I even know a masculine straight guy who enjoys being fucked by his girlfriend. For him, the idea of taking on a submissive role in bed is not seen as incompatible with masculinity. I also think it #8217;s important to recognise that some people just happen to be masculine and prefer a more dominant position by chance. A masc guy that only tops isn #8217;t necessarily only topping because they are hung up on masculinity. I can relate to this as a guy that is not particularly masc or femme but still only top because I just hate the feeling. I #8217;m actually incredibly submissive so my aversion to taking it has nothing to do with insecurity. In fact, I wish I enjoyed it because I love the idea</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Yes, exactly. Femme can be Dom, masc can be sub. We all embody a mix of attributes that have been traditionally coded as either masc or femme, so the idea that any of us are ever fully one or the other is misguided. I think we have a tendency to reduce masculinity to visual characteristics but someone could look masculine while having various feminine traits, just as someone could look femme and have lots of traits and interests associated with masculinity. I remember seeing a gay guy saying he wanted to date a masc guy because he was into football. It made laugh because all of my gay and straight masc male friends hate sport but I know a few women and a gay friend who is femme and does drag that absolutely love playing and watching the sport.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I am neither masc or fem but I #8217;ve met guys like this. I find it really problematic on a number of levels. They think they are being radical but they just end up inverting heteronormative binaries. Firstly, it reinforces the homophobic trope of gay men being inverts and feeds into the whole  #8216;you don #8217;t look gay #8217; bullshit. There is no single way of looking gay just as there is no single way or looking bi or straight. For me, challenging gender norms means not assuming that every feminine man is gay or that every masculine man is straight.That line of thinking just serves to keep everyone in their box. None of us should feel like we have to express our gender a certain way to validate our sexuality. Secondly, people pushing the idea that gay men have to be fem to be proud are essentially holding gay men to different standards than everyone else (that is unless they also think that all masculine men including trans masculine men have been brainwashed by the system) . I #8217;m sorry but if it valid for a lesbian to masc or for trans man to be masc, it is valid for a gay man to be masc. Finally, I feel that conflating gender expression and sexuality this way kind of starts to get close to a lot of transphobic tropes. Just us gender identity is not the same as sexual orientation, neither is gender expression</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I guess that being brown doesn #8217;t stop you from being immersed in a racialised culture that results in those sorts of fetishisations. If you are a brown guy that happens to be a masc dom top, I guess the fetishisation works for you I n some level because there will always be plenty of white bottoms with that fetish willing to fuck you. However, black guys that are more feminine, submissive and bottoms lose out massively from this. They have to deal with all the white guys that just won #8217;t date black people plus a whole load more white guys that will only date black guys if they meet a narrow standard that prospective white guys are not expected to meet. There is also the issue of the thing that guys fetishise only being about sex and actually being dependant on characteristics that are otherwise seen by the fetishiser as socially undesirable. There are white guys that want someone who fits their idea  #8216;the black thug #8217; in bed but wouldn #8217;t respect or want to date someone that came across that way outside of the bedroom. They want them to perform a role that they find sexually appealing but part of the appeal is all the negativity that stereotype otherwise represents. I have a couple of black friends who have complained about this, saying that they usually over compensate their masculinity when looking for hook ups but tone it down when looking for dates because so many of the guys that they have encountered looking for the hard aggressive dominant black man have zero interest in them outside of sex</TEXT>

    <TEXT>If you wouldn #8217;t be afraid, then why discriminate? I had a lot of empathy for your decision up until this comment because you a) suffered someone who tried to coerce you into sex by getting mad when you wouldn #8217;t give into their sexual advances and b) faced a false accusation from someone who, if they had had their way, would have sexually assaulted you. I think that what you went through is a huge deal and I understand why you might carry trauma that would limit how you engage with others. As a gay guy, I sometimes act differently around straight people and I know women who sometimes act differently around men, all because of trauma. I can empathise with that. However, if you have no discomfort or fear from being alone with a women in situations where you have to, trauma seems like less of the issue here. Yes, there is a tiny possibility that it could happen again, and not being alone with women reduces that tiny possibility, but there is a tiny possibility of many things. What you are describing isn #8217;t comparable to someone afraid of flying because people afraid of flying are not ok when they fly because they have to. Their irrational fear cannot be managed that easily. Without some level fear and discomfort, I fail to see how you can justify treating women like this on the grounds of trauma. There comes a point where considering the implications of our actions to others is more important than thinking about ourselves and every single possible thing that might result in discomfort. I think that point is when our actions cause way more damage to others than they do to ourselves. To not do something that by your own admission doesn #8217;t make you uncomfortable but nevertheless effects women and could make women uncomfortable is not good.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I #8217;m from the UK and I #8217;ve only ever met one TERF. Most feminists here are also trans inclusive. I #8217;m curious as to where you get this idea that British feminists are more trans exclusionary. I met Jack Halberstam at a conference and from what they were saying, the biggest difference between the US and the UK is that a lot of TERFs in the UK come from the left, whereas in the US , they seemed to think that TERFs were more politically right, which means they are more likely to pop up in queer spaces. This report seems to show less support in the US for progressing trans rights than the UK . Obviously this is a snap shot of general public opinion rather than feminism but then I wouldn #8217;t consider TERFs feminist to begin with. However , most people I have met that identify as feminists in UK have been trans inclusive https://www.ipsos.com/sites/default/files/ct/news/documents/2018-01/ipsos_report-transgender_global_data-2018.pdf</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Ah ok, yes, I remember TERFs hijacking the parade, although I believe London Pride has taken measures since. Since that event, all of the prides I know of have adopted trans inclusive pledges and many have made the decision to let trans people lead parades. Don #8217;t get me wrong, the UK is far from perfect and we have plenty of really shitty people (our prime-minister being one of them) but I wouldn #8217;t say we are any worse than the US. I mean, for one thing, hardly anyone here is religious so while we certainly have homophobia and transphobia , it is rare that you would encounter anyone that thinks LGBTQ people are the spawn of the devil. I have never even met someone that goes to church (except my great grandma), and the area I am from is probably socio-economically the equivalent (relative to the rest of the UK) as poorer conservative southern states in the US. We have long had employment, consumer and housing protection laws for LGB and T people. We also have much lower hate crimes than the US (but then violent crime is far lower here across the board). We also don #8217;t subscribe to the same ideas around free speech. Plenty of US hate groups like the west borough baptist church that speak freely in the US are banned here. Marriage and adoption has also long been available LGB and T people.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>But as someone else said, that recognition needs to come from them. I imagine that many of the men you describe just consider themselves single. They don #8217;t necessarily see sex as a defining feature of their existence but as something that may yet be to come. Also, I #8217;ve noticed a lot of young people identifying as incels. I don #8217;t think that it is healthy to label this stuff at such a young age because we end up creating a criteria of an appropriate age to have sex. At what point do you propose classifying others within your arbitrary system? I mean, are we going to categorise and classify everyone at say 20? Many 20 year olds will go on to meet someone later. They are just single a little longer than the average person. Also, their inability meet someone isn #8217;t necessarily down to something about them. Sometimes they just need to find the right people. Creating a label for anyone unlucky finding partners with whom they can be intimate would be making it about them and making it something they need to change . While I agree with people telling incels to work on themselves because their ideology is rooted in hate, which people are not going to find attractive, I don #8217;t agree with saying this to a man that has struggled with dating because of expectations surrounding masculinity. In the gay community, that would be considered femme shaming and internalised homophobia. To someone who has been bullied and made to feel ugly for not conforming to a gendered hierarchy in say high school, my response would be that high school culture can be toxic in this regard (particularly in the US it seems) and that they just need to find their people. For me, that didn #8217;t come until I was around 20. I had a very hard time in school. I was made to feel worthless and ugly for not conforming to masculinity. I have actually seen many incels that I would consider good looking so I often wonder whether they have become hung up on experiences like mine. The problem is, high school , where everyone is forced into one place against their will, having to interact with any arsehole that is there, is not representative of the world we live in. After leaving school, there are plenty of spaces and groups we can be part of that don #8217;t include the toxic bullies that dominate high school. I didn #8217;t have to change anything about my self to be desired, I just had to find social networks that were less toxic and affirmative , as many do after high school. I didn #8217;t make my experience at high school a definitive feature about myself , and I #8217;m glad I didn #8217;t. If I had, that could have created a barrier stopping me from meeting more progressive people that made me feel like I belong. Rather than categorise myself as the issue, I categorised the people that had put me down, and tried to avoid people like that in the future. After all, it was them with the problem because it was them creating a culture where anyone that didn #8217;t fit into their arbitrary box was defined as worthless. My defining feature was to say fuck you to their labels. I didn #8217;t need to define myself to legitimate my existence to them. I just needed to find good non toxic people, and when I did, I started to feel desirable and loveable .</TEXT>

At the end of the day, sexuality is more complex than just genitals. Even if genitals play a big role in sexual comparability for many people, our gayness is more than just that. If it wasn #8217;t, we would be attracted to trans women with penises. I #8217;m not attracted to trans women regardless of their genitals because I see them as women and I #8217;m not attracted to women. For many people, gay and straight, genitals are not so important.

    <TEXT>No problem. I think sexuality is way more complex and fluid than people think. A lot of people fall between gay and straight. Studies have shown that there are actually more bisexuals than gay but they bisexuals are less visible because they are less likely to be out. Even when it comes to those of us with binary sexual identities, there are a lot of people that don #8217;t attach so much significance to genitals. Historically, it was actually quite common for straight men to have sex with feminine guys because gender expression rather than sex was, within many cultures, the defining feature of sexual orientation. The idea of genitals - gt; gender - gt; sexuality is a fairly modern construction that even in many western societies, wasn #8217;t solidified as it is now across all groups until around the 19th century. At that time in Britain, the word molly, was used to describe effeminate men, working class women and female sex workers. A lot of the studies that have refuted the Kinsey scale for overestimating same sex sexual activity have since been critiqued for ignoring the fact that what was considered same sex sexuality activity then is not the same as it is now. Our whole understanding and embodiment of sexuality is always changing.</TEXT>

Don #8217;t worry, I wasn #8217;t suggesting that you are any less of a man. We can still be men without feeling the need to put others down. I #8217;m a cis man but my masculinity isn #8217;t threatened by the existence of trans men. It sounds like you have some insecurities around masculinity to work through. Before you say anything, I #8217;m not saying there is anything wrong with being masculine, I #8217;m saying that you should be able to be and feel masculine without having your entire existence and sense of self-worth called into question by the presence of trans men. That #8217;s when regular masculine becomes toxic because not only is it shit for trans people but it also also shit for you having to live your life worried that your entire identity is about to collapse at any moment when everyone else around you fails to conform to the way you see yourself in the world.

In my city, queer events are usually less mainstream and more intersectional. When I think of gay bar, I imagine a place full of white cis guys and white straight women complete with fairly basic drag queens playing Lady Gaga and Beyonc #233;. When I think about queer events in my city, in terms of music, art and performance, they are far more culturally diverse. All the LGBTQ+ spaces in my city catering for non-mainstream music tastes, art and cinema use queer to distinguish themselves from the mainstream commercial scene. The gay scene here does shit here even than play pop music and sell drinks. If I want something more comparable to gay life in Berlin, I go queer. Also, queer events attract a much broader demographic of the community. They tend to be more POC friendly and more mixed in terms gender.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I am currently writing my thesis (social science) and one of the things that has come up is the use of humour as a coping mechanism for dealing with oppression. Sometimes the humour is self deprecating, making light of painful experiences as a coping mechanism. Through reading around this, I #8217;ve come across lots of work on gallows humour and how people how marginalised groups have joked about oppression they have faced as a means of being able to relieve tension and confront things that are otherwise too painful to face. However, some of the humour isn #8217;t self-deprecating. It is punching , punching up to mock oppressive ideas. Would this still fall under gallows humour or is their another concept for this type of humour ?</TEXT>

While there are legitimate critiques of woke capitalism and people buycotting brands that use social justice images as a means of distancing themselves from things worthy of boycotts, one of the findings was that most of the people criticising Nike #8217;s hypocrisy were doing so as a means to discredit BLM. Many of the comments criticised Nike while making it clear that they did not support Kaepernick. Essentially, just like Nike, they were using social justice (in this case narratives against class exploitation) as a means of pushing their own agenda and not out of genuine care or altruism. Nike was using BLM to profit economically, while many opposing Nike were using workers rights to profit socially and maintain their white privilege</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I think the feelings are valid but whether those feelings are enough to attribute blame, legally or morally, to the person they have had sex with surely depends on what the other person has said and done. I have been in a position when I have played along with someone because of social pressure but not because of pressure from the individual I was having sex with. A good example is when I was 18 and wanted to lose my virginity. I had sex for the wrong reasons and rushed into it not because I wanted to experience sexual pleasure but because I didn #8217;t want to be a virgin. As far as the person having sex with me was concerned, I wanted it. I gave what would have looked like affirmative consent to anyone who is not a mind reader but on the inside, I was uncomfortable. I didn #8217;t freeze, I played along and pretended everything was ok . I pretended like I was living it, but I wasn #8217;t. While I felt violated by the situation, I do not for one second believe there is any way the person I had sex with could have known. He did everything humanly possible to not violate me, so when I think about that scenario, rather that seeing myself as violated by that person, I see myself as violated by a society that put me in a position where I gave affirmative consent to something I was not ready for.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>So basically you need a bf that doesn #8217;t have any desires that you cannot fulfil - no positions or kinks left unaccounted for otherwise he might cheat. Isn #8217;t that unrealistic? For me , this is when regular monogamy, which I practice, becomes toxic monogamy. My bf doesn #8217;t complete me and I do not complete him. We are our own people with our own desires. We make each other happy and we satisfy one another but neither of us are under any illusion that the other is a perfect fit because such a thing doesn #8217;t not exist. Relationships always involve some level of sacrifice. There are things I would do if I wasn #8217;t with him and vice verse, but that doesn #8217;t mean either of us are about to run off because the things that work make not having the other stuff worth while. If either of us was under the illusion that everything could be a perfect fit , I reckon that the result in a very toxic jealous relationship, which is actually the last thing I would want in a monogamous relationship .</TEXT>

I #8217;m not sure how it is in other cities but in my city, there are two scenes, the gay scene and the queer scene. The gay scene is part of the gayborhood and tends to be very commercial . If you like crude drag queens and pop music, it #8217;s great, but that really isn #8217;t my thing. The queer scene tends to be less location specific. Events pop up in different places rarely in the gayborhood. The scenes are quite disconnected. I personally find queer events more interesting. The drag is more diverse (more artistic I would say), the music is more varied (everything from pop to punk to techno) and the crowd tends to be more mixed in terms of race, gender and sexuality.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>you might think it #8217;s boring but it #8217;s realistic. I guarantee that even a gay top will want and desire many things you are unable to provide. They will see other men they find hot because you will never satisfy them 100%. That #8217;s life. If you think that #8217;s boring, I don #8217;t see how you expect to be in a monogamous relationship because one of the things that makes long term relationships work is understanding and being comfortable with the fact that we can #8217;t always get/provide everything we or our partners want in a relationship. Things that aligned when I met my bf seven years ago don #8217;t align now, but we are still together because we don #8217;t have such unrealistic expectations about having a perfect relationship where we complete one another. Personally, going by what you have said , I (a gay top) could not be happy in a relationship with someone that shares your opinion of what a relationship should look like. I would feel trapped, definitely not happy, comfortable or connected. Quite honestly, given what you have said, I would be afraid to share a kink with you because I would be worried that if you did not want to explore it, you would break up with me (or get jealous) for daring to have desires that you couldn #8217;t fulfil. That would not be the basis for healthy monogamous relationship. That would be the basis for a toxic monogamous relations founded on ideals that result in a lack of openness and honesty. Not for me. I #8217;d honestly rather give up on monogamy and have an open relationship than be in a monogamous relationship like that. Also, my comment was never about bi guys or tops/bottoms, it was about the idea that no one person can ever fully satisfy another, not even a top gay and bottom gay guy. in fact, it is possible that your ideal gay top has more desires that drift away from you than a gay vers or a bi guy because there are about million and one other things that irreducible to these arbitrary distinctions that limit what you can provide a bf, even a top bf.

    <TEXT>Yes, of course. Some relationships are more compatible than others. However, I don #8217;t think the things you have mentioned are an adequate measure of that compatibility because as I said, there are so many things that can render a couple incompatible. You could add up all your desires and all their desires but then the question emerges as to how intense any desires that diverge are. It #8217;s about quality as much as quantity. You could have a bi guy that is 90% into guys and would be absolutely fine without a woman. Meanwhile, you could have a gay guy that has some kink you hate that is a huge issue for him. Whether or not diverging desires are enough to make someone feel unhappy or trapped can #8217;t be reduced to simplistic categories. It depends on the individuals involved .I have a foot fetish. Not having someone I could explore that with would be an issue. However, there are lots of guys with foot fetishes who wouldn #8217;t see that as a deal breaker, so there would be no point in someone who is not into feet assuming that not being able to fulfil that fetish is going to result in the person feeing trapped. It may but it may not. The same applies to vers guys or bi guys. For some, not being able to sleep with a woman or a top would be a deal breaker that would leave them feeling trapped, for others not. I mean, i see this the same as some gay men being satisfied with one guy, some not. Also, on the position front, I #8217;m a top and could happily fuck my bf all day everyday but he is also a top. We have been together 7 years. The thing is, while we are both tops, neither of us are that bothered about anal. I don #8217;t miss it and I don #8217;t feel trapped so I don #8217;t see why a vers guy with a bottom would necessarily miss being fucked. Sometimes vers just means willing to be flexible to keep our partners happy as opposed to it being something we need .</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Not all guys are into anal. I #8217;m personally indifferent to it. I get off on it if my partner is into it but it #8217;s not a deal breaker. My partners the same. We do oral. We also both have plenty of kinks to keep us entertained . Maybe it would be an issue if it wasn #8217;t for the other stuff we enjoy doing, I dunno, but then you #8217;d be surprised at how many gay guys aren #8217;t bothered about anal. It #8217;s not a deal breaker for everyone. Edit: to be honest: I think I can count on my hand the number of times I #8217;ve topped in the last 10 years even. I #8217;m a top but I #8217;m submissive which makes meeting guys hard . The guys I tend to be most compatible with are the ones not bothered about anal</TEXT>

    <TEXT>If I remember rightly from the research, I think around 10% of gay men identify as sides, so neither top or bottom. However, there are then also others , like me, who are still into anal but it isn #8217;t such a big thing. My point is simply that a vers guy may not be that bothered about being fucked. They may not be willing to forgo anal but what there kind of anal they have may not be an issue for them. It might, but it depends on the person. There is also the chance that a vers guy is way more top. They might be capable of being 50/50 in relationship to keep their partner happy but there preference may still be to top</TEXT>

Exactly, it is good grammatical form to use the singular they in these context. However, from marking undergrad essays, I can tell you that lots of people do no understand grammar.

    <TEXT>Thanks for this. Your definition makes sense given how i I #8217;ve seen the concept used in existing literature. However, I have also seen it used in the context of other forms of oppression like rape victims making jokes about being raped. The distinction I #8217;m seeing there is that the object of humour is self facing oppression (whether that be death or harm) rather the object of humour being the oppressor. Would you agree with that? If so, to go back to my question about jokes made by gay people, would a gay man cracking a joke about being a dirty f***** fit within gallows humour. I #8217;ve seen many gay men (usually drag queens) crack such self deprecating jokes.</TEXT>

I #8217;ve ended up framing them all as gallows humour but what I think I need to do is just talk about humour as a coping mechanism and then go on to talk about gallows humour separately as an example that even under the most desperate situations, humour is used as a defence mechanism</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Oh definitely. I didn #8217;t word my comment very well. My point was more that upholding the child #8217;s right inadvertently results in the father knowing their child. If the child #8217;s right to know their father is upheld, then the father would not not be restricted from knowing them (unless of course it is not within the child #8217;s best interest, but then the child #8217;s best interest could result in the mother being denied access as well). Personally, I #8217;m in favour of child #8217;s rights over parental rights. In response to your comment about pregnancy, I also agree. The child #8217;s rights start when the child is born. My comment was not about pregnancy , which is why I said child rather than fetus. The father doesn #8217;t need to know anything (if in the child #8217;s interest) until the child is born Edit: I #8217;m not sure about the choice residing with the child though because if a decision not to tell the father they have been born results in the child not knowing their father (and potentially assuming the father didn #8217;t want to know them), then the mother has taken something away from the child that could prevent the child from making an informed decision when they are old enough to do so. Unless the father is an abusive arsehole that would not serve the best interests of the child, I think they should be informed once the child is born not for their rights or the mother #8217;s rights but for the best interests of the child. Personally, if my mother had to prevented me from knowing my father, even if I had another (or other) parental figure(s) in my life, I would have seen that as something against my agency.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>It depends. Most egalitarians I meet only support equal opportunities within an unequal playing field, which I oppose in favour of equity based solutions. However, I have met a few egalitarians that actually hold feminist values in favour of equity but don #8217;t identify as feminist because they either see themselves as allies or have misconceptions about what feminism actually is. I try to challenge those misconceptions and convince them that some of their ideas are actually feminist (with varying levels of success) . I guess for me, if I had to generalise, my judgment of someone is more likely to come down to what they actually believe and do in practice. I know some egalitarians that actually agree with more contemporary feminist ideas and values (without realising those ideas and values are feminist) than some people that identify as feminists. In these cases, I guess I see it as actions speaking louder than words.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>To be honest, when I think of equity, I #8217;m not necessarily thinking of quotas, nor am I necessarily thinking about a 50/50 split across absolutely all industries. While quotas can be good in certain areas, i see them as trying to fix something that is already broken. There are lots of things that need to change prior to even applying for jobs to make the job market more equitable. One of the biggest issue I have with quotas is that they tend to create diversity across identities but quite often, the women, people of colour and LGBTQ+ included by those quotas are disproportionately middle/upper class. This is not to say that I #8217;m against quotas because we have to try work with a broken system as we try to change it but for quotas to actually be equitable, we bigger changes to our economy and education system would also be necessary. On the issue of all industries being a perfect 50/50 split, I think for me, a bigger issue (or perhaps just as important issue) would be making sure jobs that have been associated with women and femininity are paid better. As a society, we tend to undervalue jobs associated with women, such as education and other caring roles. I feel that this needs to change (and I say that as a man working in education).</TEXT>

I #8217;m not quite sure why they are so different to other east bloc countries. Even Slovakia is much more conservative, but then Slovakia is also very catholic. The majority of Czech #8217;s support gay marriage and they have had civil partnerships for a while. You are right, it isn #8217;t Sweden, but public attitudes are more progressive than some Western European countries like Italy and Greece . I used to hold my partners hand in the street and never had an issue. I #8217;m actually more cautious about PDA here in the UK because even though the UK is more progressive, those that are closer minded about it tend to be much more violent. The Czech Republic has very low violent crime and a strong culture of people minding their own business. You might get a whisper but someone shouting at you or touching you in the street breaks so many social norms. Hate crimes against LGBTQ people are very low in Prague and their gay scene is not hidden Edit: one thing I don #8217;t think they score well on at all is trans rights https://www.pewresearch.org/global/2013/06/04/the-global-divide-on-homosexuality/ https://news.expats.cz/weekly-czech-news/most-czechs-67-support-same-sex-marriage-says-new-poll/</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I did look at the links. To be honest, I #8217;d be curious to know what measures were used. Looking at other evidence around on social attitudes towards whether homosexuality, gay marriage and gay adoption are acceptable, there is no denying that they are way ahead of Poland. Every single study conducted in the last 10 years has documented high levels of support for gay rights in Czech. Support for gay marriage there is comparable to many Western European countries. You can find a fairly extensive list of peer reviewed sources on the LGBT Czech Wikipedia page. If you look at comparative studies of Europe on support for such rights, you will see that there is a huge difference in attitudes between Poland and Czech. Poland has nowhere near of a majority in support of gay marriage or adoption, and the rate of hate crimes in Poland and anti LGBTQ protests there are huge. There didn #8217;t see any anti LGBTQ protestors at Prague Pride but I have in Poland and in Slovakia. That said, there are issues in the Czech Republic which I feel could result in their low score, namely support for trans people. If conflating LGB and T rights, I can see them scoring badly, but this because of transphobia, which doesn #8217;t effect gay people there unless they are trans. The other thing I could see contributing to their low score is micro aggressions. While a significant majority of Czech #8217;s support the right for gay people to live freely and openly, marry and adopt, I would say that many of those that accept are still more ignorant than in western European countries with comparable levels of support. Quantitatively, they are very open, but qualitatively, there are definitely some differences. I think this is because the thing driving support in the Czech Republic is a strong belief in individual freedom free from powers or church and state as opposed to genuine acceptance. However, as a gay man living there, such attitudes, albeit limited, made life pretty easy. As I said earlier, I am more cautious holding my bfs hand in the UK because while we are definitely more tolerant, people here like to get involved in other people #8217;s business, which is the last thing you want when encountering a homophobe</TEXT>

    <TEXT> gt; I think people with PTSD specifically about/around fabric coverings for their faces are 1) in the minority and 2) still likely to able to wear a face shield-- because it doesn't obstruct the mouth or nose. Yes, I totally agree. I guess I take a hard line stance about it because specifically in the US people have been like, inappropriately exploiting the ADA and claiming disabled identities etc as justification for not wearing a mask when they are not disabled (re: breathing or PTSD)-- they just don't want to wear a mask, so I chafe at the idea that we shouldn't say anything to people not wearing masks on the basis that they *might* have an invisible disability.  gt; I think this might be why leftist in the UK are giving more benefit of the doubt to non wearers. I haven #8217;t seen or heard anyone here make a fuss when asked to wear a mask, so perhaps the minority not wearing them whether for legitimate reasons or not is less of an issue here. As I said in another comment, most of our major supermarket chains have said that they will not enforce it because they don #8217;t want to ask people to prove their disabilities.

    <TEXT>Thanks. It #8217;s good to hear the thoughts of someone struggling with this. I #8217;m not quite sure why the left in the UK is thinking about this so differently. A few people came forward in response to the article with similar comments to yours and they were told that they were being ableist for assuming their experience of ptsd was the same as others. Suggestions to stay home if not wearing a mask were also met with accusations of ableism. I think it may be because the vast majority of people here are adhering to the guidelines and we don #8217;t have so many people shouting about things like personal freedom. Even in the shops not enforcing it, the majority are wearing them so when we do walk past the odd person without them, i guess we are more likely to give them the benefit of the doubt. If we had the opposition that the US seems to have, I guess people would feel differently about it.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Thanks for this. As I said to someone else, a few people commented on the article I shared saying they experienced PTSD and that it wasn #8217;t an excuse not to wear but they were immediately shot down as ableist for assuming what works for them works for others. It seems like the left in the UK is thinking about this very differently. However, I agree with what you are saying. I think that we have to find ways to cope because it #8217;s not just about us</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Sorry, when I said there are lots more other government failures, I mean that even federal regulations on masks would not be enough unless adopted alongside lots of other federal initiatives. As we have seen here in Europe, there are countries that haven #8217;t been on masks out perform some countries that have been strict simply because they were doing lots of other things like closing down non essential businesses, placing restrictions on non essential travel and enforcing social distancing in public places. The countries that have done best have had masks alongside all of this in their stuff.</TEXT>

I #8217;m sure some of the people here are weaponising disability to be honest but I think the feeling of myself and others on the left is that if the amount of non wearers is really low , there is little to gain from assuming the worst of non wearers. As I say, I think our attitude to it would be very different if we had a big problem with people refusing to wear them. Edit: something that I haven #8217;t mentioned that seems different here is that it is our right wing that has been strong on social policing through Covid. I have come across people saying people should be shot for breaking social distancing guidelines , so maybe that has something to do with our left wing response</TEXT>

I actually came across the article because it was shared by feminist queer organisation I am affiliated with. We really don #8217;t have the same issues with people refusing to wear masks here. I would say that here, it is the right wing that are taking social distancing guidelines most seriously, but they take it to the other extreme, which is what has prompted this article from a left leaning source.

If I meet someone who doesn #8217;t want to date bisexuals, I don #8217;t want to sleep with them because I don #8217;t date bigots. That is my preference.

Preferences are not born out of nowhere. When preferences are grounded in problematic assumptions and power structures, they deserve to be called out . Easy solution, if someone doesn #8217;t want to date bisexuals and doesn #8217;t want to be called out on it, they can just keep their prejudice to themselves . They don #8217;t have to give reasons for rejecting someone so the world doesn #8217;t need to know that they don #8217;t date bisexuals because [insert biphobic stereotype].

    <TEXT>I would recommend Lisa Duggan #8217;s was work on homonormativity. If you have not clicked with queer theory, she might be a good start because she looks at identity politics through a strong materialist lens. There is also a good article by Shannon Weber called *what #8217;s wrong with becoming queer*, which looks at how homonormative resistance to heteronormativity has oppressed bisexuals. As for your comment about cultural minorities dating other cultural minorities, i am not sure. I have an Indian friend that is very vocal about sexual racism among Indians against black people , so I guess that exclusionary preferences are still problematic. Like I said, I get that we match over shared experiences. However, the lesbian or gay community is not a monolith. There is no such thing a universal gay experience that can be held in opposition to a bisexual experience. There are lots of differences within and between such groups. That said, certain experiences may be more common among one group than the other, so I get that while we might have an open mind to dating outgroups, compatibility may be more likely with one that the other. I think there is a big difference between making universal claims to defend a universal preference and being more likely to match with one group than another.</TEXT>

If they don #8217;t want to date you because they are worried you will cheat or because they are worried you can #8217;t be satisfied with just one gender, then i would say that they a dehumanising bisexuals by reducing all bisexuals to a stereotype that erases the many bisexuals that absolutely can be satisfied in a monogamous relationship.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I think I agree with you in part because I do recognise that different experiences exist that may make us more comparable with some than others. I guess I #8217;m somewhere in between. For me, preferences are only problematic when they completely rule out another group as something other. I recognise that the stuff that unites groups may not always be enough to compensate for the difference between, which is why I get that a lesbian and a bisexual may be *less likely* than and lesbian and lesbian to be compatibility. However, I reject the idea that compatability can be universalised. That said, I agree that individuals should not be the focus. For me, it always comes down to why someone is discriminating and whether the reasons they provide feed oppression. For example, if someone said to me that they only dated lesbians because they felt they had more in common, I would find it kind of strange but I wouldn #8217;t say anything. However, if someone said they don #8217;t date bisexuals because they would be worried they would cheat (which is a very common reason), then I think they should be called in on it because the reason is biphobic Edit: and no problem.

Reducing an entire group of people to such an assumption is still dehumanising in my opinion.

If you don #8217;t see it that way, good for you. I know many bisexual activists that feel very differently.

    <TEXT>I think we are going to have to agree to disagree on this one. Personal experiences do not exist independently of society and culture. We attribute meaning to our personal experiences with society and culture. I have heard many people say they would not date bisexuals because of assumptions around cheating even when they have never met a bisexual person, so that assumption is much bigger than personal experience. Also, I have met people that have been cheated on by people of different sexual orientations, yet they selectively draw on past experiences to single out bisexuals. As for your point about lesbians not restricting bisexuals from getting jobs, I am not sure what your point is. Societal prejudice emerges in lots of different forms. There isn #8217;t just one type of oppression, there are micro aggressions and macro aggressions. Just because someone doesn #8217;t want to kill gays or just because they have gay friends or once have a job to a gay person doesn #8217;t mean they are not homophobic.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>That #8217;s fair. Sorry to hear that you are struggling with it but as you say, we have to think about risk to other people. As I was saying elsewhere on this thread, I think the UK may have a different mindset on this because the vast majority of people are wearing masks indoors. We don #8217;t really have an anti-mask movement. If anything, I #8217;d say the left is more relaxed about mask wearing than the right here. We have had lots of issues with right wingers confronting essential workers without uniforms when leaving the house during lockdown and some really violent people on the right saying people going to parks deserve to be shot. I think this may be why the more left wing media and it #8217;s followers are trying to get people to keep an open mind about seeing people not wearing masks. I would say that 90 % of people are wearing them so perhaps not confronting the 10% that aren #8217;t because of things like disabilities is seen as a better option than making them targets of the right wingers. It #8217;s interesting how in the US, the right seem to think Covid-19 is a communist conspiracy.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>No, not necessarily toxic masculinity. I mean any disadvantage faced by men, for example, inadequate mental health resources being grounded in constructions that men are supposed to be strong, which stand in opposition to women constructed as weak, or issues around paternity, which stem from the the assumption that childcare is a woman #8217;s job. Both of these things, while harmful to many men, are grounded i gendered assumptions that effect women too (assumptions that feminism works to deconstruct). As for your point around homelessness, I #8217;m not completely sure as to why men are more likely to be homeless but I see the issue as overlapping with a number of concerns that many feminists are working to challenge. Firstly, homelessness is an issue of class Inequality, and many feminists support the need for better welfare to support those most economically disadvantaged because when it comes to class inequality, working class women also suffer in a number of gender specific ways, for example, they are more likely to be single parents and thus have to struggle with poverty while caring for children. I also can #8217;t help but wonder whether one of the reasons women are less likely to be homeless isn #8217;t because people with dependant children are prioritised for social housing. While having a roof is certainly a privilege denied to many people, the social forces leading to men being more likely to be homeless may be entangled to better support for families, which men can access when, like women, they have dependants. Another issue that I can see contributing to this in some places is the idea that women are vulnerable in need of protection. While in the case of homelessness, this could majorly disadvantaged men, it is grounded in assumptions about women that harm women in other ways and is therefore something that feminists actively challenge.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I mean, the way society is organised now is completely different. We are much more dependant on each other now because we are not self sufficient anymore. We are an adaptable species. Some of the qualities back then are not particularly useful anymore, in the same way that certain qualities now would not have been useful then. Anyway, aside from that, by saying men may be disadvantaged in terms of homelessness because of expectations that they should be strong and take care of themselves, I am not passing judgment on whether men are strong or not. I #8217;m saying that as a society, patriarchal norms see men as being in less need of protection. Your yourself support the idea that men should be strong so why is Male homelessness an issue to you? If men are supposed to be stronger, wouldn #8217;t that mean that they can handle life on streets easier and therefore need to be last in line for housing? If men are naturally stronger, even if they made up 80% of homelessness, it would be impossible to compare that 80% of men to the 20% of women because while quantitively more likely to face homelessness, the 20% of supposedly weaker homeless women would behave it so much harder. Personally, I see you assertion that men should be strong as justifying the already appalling lack of intervention in addressing the problem, which is precisely why I would support a feminist response that sees men as sometimes highly vulnerable and in need of protection.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Ah ok. We don #8217;t have this in my country but that seems wrong to me. Everyone should be able to to have paternity test. I mean , not all men are disadvantaged by this because not all men are straight and not all can have kids but I get you, this is a shit disadvantage that men face. I don #8217;t really have a feminist response to this because it isn #8217;t something that occurs within my country because paternity tests are accessible to all. However, many issues I see raised by MRAs about gender norms negatively impacting men do negatively impact women in different ways, which is why, for the most part, my  #8220;activism #8221; for men #8217;s issues works with rather than against feminism. I guess I see this issue as being a matter of paternity rights, which should could be addressed through feminist response against seeing men as secondary to child rearing. Obviously a woman doesn #8217;t have to worry about it because of biology but this is something that we cannot control. What we can do is offer paternity tests to address the issue. As for your comment on COVID, I was referring to inequalities that are caused by social factors. I don #8217;t think there is much feminists or MRAs can do about the fact that men are more effected by it but if you have some ideas , I #8217;d be interested in hearing them. Finally, to address your point on prostate cancer, I always assumed that prostate cancer got less awareness and funding because the survival rate is much higher. Given that a lot of the funding relies on donations, I #8217;m not sure how we can force people to donate more money. Personally, I wouldn #8217;t donate to either because there are other cancers with far lower survival rates that I support. Just as I support spending public money for paternity tests for men because of biological limitations in knowing whether a child is theirs, I also support spending more money on cancers that due to biology, are more harmful.</TEXT>

    <TEXT> gt;Still, paternity tests cost money, and if they show that the child is not fathered by the man that got the test, that does not ensure - not by a long shot - that he is free from paying for that child that is not his. True, which is why I would support making them accessible, especially for people that can #8217;t afford  gt; In many, if not most, jurisdictions, a man can get stuck paying for a child who is provably not his, just because he thought it was his, and acted accodingly. Again, this is why I support making paternity tests accessible so that an uncertainty can be actresses from the start. I agree that this is terrible but I #8217;m not sure what you mean by  #8220;probably not his #8221;. Most fathers stated on birth certificates are the biological fathers. Of course some people lie but people do all kinds of terrible shit. To be honest, I think anyone that cheats and doesn #8217;t tell their partner is sick, *especially* if they haven #8217;t used protection not to not because of pregnancies but also because of STIs. I agree that anyone who is not the father shouldn #8217;t be expected to support the child but other than better paternity tests, I don #8217;t see how else we can address this. I guess there could be legal consequences on account of fraud in cases where someone has deliberately deceived their partner but then proving intent beyond reasonable doubt would be an issue. I think having affordable and accessible testing from the start.  gt; What we men see is lots of women arguing that paternity tests should be used to nail a kid to a man, but when the test conclusively show that there is no familial link between a specific man and a specific child, then that test should have no legal value. Double standards. And yes, we men judge you women by your worst. Don #180;t like that? Rein them in. I #8217;m not sure what you mean here. If someone has a paternity test in my country and that tests shows they are not the father, it holds legal value. The father doesn #8217;t have to support a child that isn #8217;t his.  gt; That was not specified in the post that I responded to. I mean, no I didn #8217;t but I assumed it was implied that feminist activism can #8217;t cure COVID . I mean, feminism also can #8217;t address the issue that men on average are taller and have higher levels of testosterone. Feminism can equalise every biological difference.  gt; The state should build factories for PPE in general and PAPR masks in particular, and staff them with people who have been laid off from various companies that have gone belly-up. Fund the whole shebang with Corona war bonds, and deal with the inflationary effects later on. I agree. I think that everyone should have adequate protection and I also think that the state needs to offer financial support to those laid or made sick as a result of covid. If men are are in need of more protection and  gt; As for survival rate: 68,7% of all women will survive 10 years after their breast cancer diagnosis. The corresponding figure for men with prostate cancer is 68,9%. So, the prostate survival rate is higher, but by such a tiny margin so that it essentially is the same. Ah ok, so I was looking at stats in my country that showed the survival rate for prostate cancer to be much higher but I didn #8217;t look at the survival rate over 10 years so perhaps prostate cancer is more likely to return. Anyway, if they are about the same, I don #8217;t see the issue. I would see the issue of prostate cancer was much lower but it isn #8217;t. I don #8217;t think we need to spend equal things on every thing. I #8217;d sooner see more money spent on a medical issue that disproportionately effects men , like covid .  gt; Where I live, donations are a minor part of research funding. Taxes are the big thing. Ah ok, that #8217;s different. Here, particularly breast cancer, is heavily funded by charity fundraising.  gt; I am grateful for that.

While I support the right to have the right to easy access tests if they are wanted, I personally would only want one if I felt i couldn #8217;t trust my partner (in which case I would be questioning if i wanted to even be with someone I couldn #8217;t trust).</TEXT>

    <TEXT> gt;True, which is why I would support making them accessible, especially for people that can #8217;t afford. That adresses money issues. It does not adress privacy issues. One can easily envision a case a where a wife sets an ultimatum: Back off the paternity test, or else I will divorce you and bleed you dry in the divorce case, and you will not be able to see your biological child at all! I mean, there is not denying that this is wrong and abusive. However, just as I would support your rights to a paternity test, I expect you to respect my right not to have one unless I choose. Yes, having an opt in system comes with risks but it #8217;s a risk I #8217;m happy to take. Many of us would not be willing to be with someone we can #8217;t trust and being forced to take a paternity test feels wrong. There are many things lack if legislations empowers people to do but some of us don #8217;t want all aspects of our lives legislated against. Again, I feel that this should be a choice not a routine.  gt;I wrote provably, not probably. Big difference. Sorry, my bad.  gt; I think that consensually becoming a parent with a person not your spouse should be criminal in and of itself, and intent should not be part of the formal definition of the crime. Exceptions for sperm and egg donations, of course.  gt; so what would this look like in practice. How do you prove they consensually had a baby? We can #8217;t exactly start prosecuting for cheating. Accidents happen. Which means that the only thing left to prosecute would be intent of someone knowing they were impregnated by someone else.  gt; an many countries in that regard. May I ask in which country you reside? That does not change the fact that in many jurisdictions, men who are not fathers still can get dinged by child support for a child born by a woman that was/is their wife, or someone that they had consensual sex with. I #8217;m in the UK. Someone who has a paternity test (which should be easier to access than they are) can have their name removed from the birth certificate and doesn #8217;t have to pay  gt; Another thing: If a paternity test in your country shows that a man is not a father of a child, can he get back payment for the child support he has paid prior to the paternity test? If he was married to the mother of the child, and he paid for general upkeep of that child living together with him, can he get that refunded also? I #8217;m not sure about refunds. Possibly through filing a fraud case but not sure. I #8217;ll have to check that tbh.  gt; Now, if one could other women to accept that paternity tests should be routine, then that would be even better. Given what I see on this subreddit (and others) it appears that you have a bit of convincing to do before that becomes commonplace. I think they should be offered free of charge to those that need them but I personally don #8217;t want one  gt;It is fine that you trust your partner. In quite a few cases, such trust proves to be misplaced. Yes but it #8217;s mine to give. While often displaced, not having it creates all kinds of other toxic dynamics in a relationship. I would never be with someone I can #8217;t trust. Even though that hasn #8217;t always worked out, having that attitude has in my opinion enabled me to have far more fulling relations not tarnished by insecurities and jealousy. Edit: i think we might have to agree to disagree on this. We both clearly agree on the need for changes to paternity rights Edit 2: on the airport comparison. I want everyone to be checked because I don #8217;t know anyone and have no basis to trust them. I expect the government to carry out checks on travellers but I don #8217;t expect the government to carry our checks on my friends who are visiting me at say home. A friend I trust could harm me and the government may have information that could have empowered me to avoid that harm but Im not going to start doing checks on all my friends because trust, regardless or risk, is a part of friendship</TEXT>

Feminists #8800;women. Many women do consider these things inherent to their identities. Therefore, trans women are no different to cis women that understand and embody their gender this way. If someone wants to take a feminist position against such expressions of womanhood, singling out trans women is disingenuous because lots of women , irrespective or whether they are cis or trans, have attachments to such modes of gender expression. However, many trans women , like cis women, also reject these modes of expression. I mean, why would we expect trans women as women to behave any differently to cis women. They also grow up in a culture which celebrates some expression of femininity over others. Trans women also face the risk of violence if they are not feminine enough so I guess some try harder to pass in order to avoid that</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Hey everyone, I #8217;m really not sure how common this is as I #8217;ve only come across it online and have never met someone who wants to be referred to as  #8216;it #8217; but it seems to be gaining popularity (like queer and other terms). I #8217;m torn because personally, using it to describe another person is actually quite triggering for me. Edit: I get that it means different things to different people and I recognise that different embodiments are valid, I just wonder whether there is space for discussing the trauma it causes, even if that discussion is centred around helping people get past that trauma Edit 2: I identify as queer but I #8217;m not sure whether I would expect someone who has say been beaten up whilst being called queer to say that word. Obviously it is different in that it is used in other contexts but in the context of defining an adult human, it can have similar associations not just for LGBTQ people but for other margrinalised groups, some of who were represents communities reduced to it as actual property. While I identify as queer, I reclaim it in away that is perhaps more akin to how the black community is reclaimed the n-word. I have never heard a black person ask other black people to call them the n-word, and I certainly haven #8217;t heard of black people ask white people to call them that word. The same with women who reclaim slut. However, it seems that the LGBTQ+ community, of which I am a part of, are reclaiming certain words in ways that are so integral to identity that others have to use them even if they cause pain.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>To be honest, your answer has been great because I don #8217;t think a clear cut answer is helpful. I just think that with any word (or form of use) so deeply connected with histories of trauma (in this case histories that are not just about gender because  #8220;it #8221; has been used to dehumanise many groups), then there should be space to discuss an perhaps compromise through either another pronoun or just using a name. I #8217;d be very interested to hear what people of colour think about using such a word given how it #8217;s also been racialised. I guess unlike the other pronouns,  #8216;it #8217; isn #8217;t just the LGBTQs community word to reclaim. Given its history, some groups of cishet people could reclaim it. While some might want to reclaim it as a gender pronoun, I dont think it can ever be exclusively such without erasing those other relationships with the pronoun It #8217;s interesting that out of all the pronouns and neopronouns, this is the only one that elicits such trauma. My trans friend would happily use absolutely any other pronoun but for her, saying this particularly one would be like calling someone the f-word or tr**ny.</TEXT>

    <TITLE>Do notions of patriarchal bargain fairly account for privilege and power gained in excess of patriarchy?</TITLE>
    <DATE>2020-08-25 12:36:38</DATE>
    <TEXT>My title is a little abstract so let me explain, but before I do, I just want to acknowledge that my thoughts on this are a little scattered and I #8217;m struggling to articulate them so if this all just complete rubbish, inconsistent or based on misunderstanding, I #8217;m totally open to criticism. As an active contributor to this community, I am here in good faith. This is not an attack on feminism but something I #8217;ve observed across multiple social justice movements in which I #8217;m either an ally or active participant. I often see bad things women do that affect other marginalised groups reduced to patriarchy. I may be misunderstanding the idea of the patriarchal bargain but the way I #8217;ve interpreted it is that women sometimes assimilate with patriarchal expectations to access power otherwise denied to them. The issue I have with this is that sometimes the power accessed is power over other marginalised groups. A lot of working class and black feminist scholars have spoke about how white middle class femininities have been weaponised against other groups, so I #8217;m wondering if it #8217;s always fair to reduce assimilation with a white bourgeois masculinist system to nothing but a struggle against power when what is gained through such bargains is also often power over marginalised groups. I should mention that I see the same thing with other social justice movements. I #8217;m queer and often see queer people assimilating with racist and classist systems similarly reduced to victims. For example, LGBTQ supporters for trump are often reduced to self-haters desperate to gain respectability and status within a system that works against them. Similarly, I think that this ignores the many reasons an LGBTQ person might vote for conservative groups and assimilate with conservative people #8217;s expectations beyond self-hate and pressure from heteronormativity. For example, I #8217;m sure that many white affluent LGBTQ republicans know that the party does not represent their interests but make an active choice to support them in order to sustain say their economic interests and white privilege. What could be considered a heteronormative bargain could be less about wanting to be respected by straight/cis people and more about be willing take their losses under heteronormativity in order benefit and exert power over other marginalised groups.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Adding to the other responses, it #8217;s also weird because it often involves non sex workers speaking over the voices of sex workers, which, in the process, does the very thing that they are accusing clients of doing.... it denies sex workers agency. When it comes to discussions of agency and oppression, those discussions should centre the voices of those navigating the issues we are concerned about. I used to do sex work. Was it empowering and did I have complete full agency? No, I don #8217;t think we ever have complete agency because we are all immersed in a system that both consciously and subconsciously restricts us in various ways. However, was it empowering compared to other options I had at the time? Yes! I consented to sex work because if I didn #8217;t I would have had to consent to doing something else with my body and sex work felt like the most rewarding option. Would I rather have not done sex work? Again, yes, but then in order for that to happen, major structural change would be necessary. Until that change happens, I object to anyone standing in the way of me doing what I felt was most life-affirming, *especially* when those objections are coming from people who are economically privileged. I had entitled middle class people tell me that I was being exploited for doing sex work yet who were silent when I was working for minimum wages. While many of them did recognise that all labour is exploitative, they saw sex work as more exploitative, but that wasn #8217;t their decision to make. I personally found sex work less exploitative than minimum wage work because it enabled me to do so much more with my life (and by extension body) than I could have done otherwise. Telling me what was best for me and standing in the way of policy change that allowed me to make *choices* on how best to navigate exploitation was taking away my agency , all why assuming expertise on *choices* they never had to make. As such, just as I think women #8217;s voices should be centred in feminism, I think sex workers voices should be centred in sex work.</TEXT>

    <TEXT> gt; I just wanted a discussion on sex-selective abortion and how it can be prevented. I know of a few places that don #8217;t do gender screenings to prevent sex-selective abortion. People can still have abortions but they have to make a decision without knowing gender. I #8217;m not sure how others feel about that here but I think this is a good solution, not least because it stops sex selective abortions but also because i feel gender screening is transphobic. At the end of the day, doctors are not able to tell us the gender of our child. Also , if gender screening is seen as an acceptable choice, doesn #8217;t that just open a can of worms for researchers to develop ways of screening for  #8216;undesirable #8217; characteristics? Personally, I see such screening as institutionalised support for eugenics. Edit: after thinking about my comment some more, the only thing I #8217;d add is that there is if removing gender screening, other things may need to change. For example, as others have said, in some countries, having a child that will be assigned female at birth can make parents liable for dowries. There seems little point in banning gender screening against transphobia when a child is just going to be assigned sex at birth</TEXT>

Also, differences observed today are different from differences that would have been observed 100 years ago. Even physiological differences have shifted. I was reading something by a feminist sociobiologist called Anne Fausto-Sterling, and she talks about how the average height of men versus women has decreased due to social norms enabling women to be more physically active during childhood and adolescence, which in turn has an effect on growth hormones . I #8217;m not a biologist so I don #8217;t understand the technical details but I thought it was fascinating how something like height, which I would have assumed to be a fairly standard physical difference (on average), is effected by cultural behaviours</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Ah interesting. As I said, I #8217;m not a biologist. Is it not possible that both are contributing factors? The author I referred to does have a background in biology. She was never reducing height to the effect of shifting patterns of exercise and hormones but merely pointing out that it exercise is one of many contributing socio-biological factors. Are you saying that exercise doesn #8217;t effect growth hormones in adolescence? Edit: also, what does race mixing have to do with gender differences? The author I cited does not say whether people have gotten shorter or taller, she says that in the west, the observed height differences between men and women has become smaller. People could be shorter overall for that statement to remain true Edit 2: just to add, she also doesn #8217;t deny that height difference is a thing. She is simply illustrating how attitudes effecting behaviour can have an impact on hormones in order demonstrate how nature and nurture are not entirely separate forces, which *is not* to say that biological capacity is unlimited, not by any stretch . She is not for one second suggesting that a 160cm Asian man could have been 200cm if only he had exercised more. However, he could well ended up *slightly* shorter or taller depending on a range of environmental factors</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Yes, fair point, perhaps she was looking at stats of higher class women or measuring shifts in urban areas after the period when most people worked in agriculture. To be honest , I couldn #8217;t really care less about something as mundane as height. Her main point was simply that exercise effects growth hormones, and social norms can effect exercise. If you have any evidence that exercise *in adolescence* doesn #8217;t effect growth hormones, I #8217;d be more than happy to read but otherwise, I #8217;ll take the word of the sociobiologist. Again, She was not for one second suggesting that this was a big deal. Her point was simply that society and culture do not exist independently of biology and nature. Nature is malleable interacting with environmental factors. Obviously, the weight attributed biological versus environmental factors is going to vary. She doesn #8217;t suggest otherwise. Her point is simply that nothing is 100% reducible to biology Edit: just to add, the point about height was not the focus of the book. It was just one of many examples about how culture and biology interact and how nothing is *fully* reducible to one or the other.</TEXT>

What you are saying is something that aligns very much with Kinsey #8217;s work, but the Kinsey study has been heavily criticised for sampling and more recent studies have argued that he significantly overestimated the level of same-gender attraction.Those studies still agree that sexuality is a spectrum but they haven #8217;t replicated Kinsey #8217;s results in showing that those in between constitute a majority. They have only shown that people are more likely to be in between than exclusively gay/lesbian. I say this as a queer person who would be very much invested in the idea that 100% heteros are a minority but this doesn #8217;t align with any of the contemporary research I #8217;ve read. However, I was genuinely curious as to whether you had read some more up to date stats because I #8217;m aware that some studies now look at this stuff by measuring subconscious arousal rather than through self-reported data.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>No worries. There is a really good book on the gay history of New York that goes into detail about the Kinsey study and subsequent counter studies that have failed to replicate the results. It is by someone called Chauncey. I may have a copy I can link you to on Dropbox if you #8217;re interested. Essentially, what the more contemporary literature has shown is that most people are straight (in terms of both identity and behaviour) but people in between are far more common than those that are exclusively gay/lesbian. I am a sociologist that specialises in sexuality so I am familiar with a lot of literature *but* my knowledge is heavily restricted to interview and survey data. I do believe some of this stuff has been replicated by studies measuring subconscious arousal patterns but that work falls outside my area of expertise. If I remember rightly, studies on arousal patterns have shown that more people fall in between than suggested by self-reported data but the majority are still straight (this is definitely true for men although I have a feeling it may not be the case for women. I #8217;d have to revisit the literature to check). That said, i do know that the measures of those arousal studies have also been criticised. However, your assertion that sexuality is a spectrum is 100% correct, and I think it #8217;s worth noting that these studies only show us the distribution of sexualities at a particular time. There is plenty of evidence to suggest that sexuality could be more fluid than it presently is if it wasn #8217;t for the cisheteronormative culture we grow up in. As sociologists, we often show this by pointing to the rich variation of sexuality across time and different cultures. This stuff is always changing so it is possible that in the future, everyone could fall in the middle. Chauncey actually makes an interesting argument against the counter studies not based on their validity at the time they were conducted but on the basis that sexuality was understood and embodied differently at the time Kinsey wrote. One of the things he mentions, which fits with what you are saying about gender being a spectrum, Is that at the time Kinsey wrote, many people, particularly working-class and non-white populations, had grown up in cultures where sexuality was understood and organised more around gender presentation than sex. For example, he talks about how during the 18th and 19th century, it was common for feminine men to be considered as being like women, so a man sleeping with a man wouldn #8217;t have necessarily been understood as gay or even bi. Edit: the way gender and sexuality used to be understood and embodied is exemplified quite nicely by the etymology of the word molly, which , at the time Chauncey is referring to, was used synonymously for male sodomites, effeminate men, female sex workers and working class women. Edit 2: when I say sexuality could be more fluid if it wasn #8217;t for the cisheteronormative culture we grow up in, i just want to be clear that I #8217;m not suggesting that sexual orientation is something that can be changed at will. Hopefully this is clear but happy to unpack this more if not</TEXT>

It #8217;s definitely given me a lot to think about because I agree that the word slut it still extremely loaded, although part of me wonders whether this wasn #8217;t the same for n-word when it it started to be reclaim? I #8217;m not black so I honestly wouldn #8217;t know. As for fag, I #8217;m English too haha. As it happens, I use the word all the time for cigarettes . It #8217;s just the context of using it for a person I struggle with. Queer is fine for me, but then that is also something that was reclaimed at a time when most people saw queer very negatively. One thing I do feel quite strongly about is these words been used by oppressors, and I also hate it when people think that because they reclaim something as a way to deal with their trauma, that it #8217;s something we all have to do. I might call myself queer but if I #8217;m referring to a group of LGBTQIA+ people that may or may not like it, I always go for LGBTQIA. As for how common these gay slurs are used today, i think things have got a lot better, although I think it depends on place and whether you pass as straight. For example , I have lived in Bristol for 4 years and have never had any issues but for the most part , I pass (at least until I open my mouth). However, I have a gay friend who is femme presenting and he #8217;s had several awful encounters. The other thing I think makes a difference is age. I had these slurs all through high school but once I started working, I had no issues. I think the issue was that kids weren #8217;t been taught about LGBTQ+ people so a lot of the kids that were awful to me in school probably became more open. The thing I would say about marriage is that it was very much fought for on the back of normalising us and telling the straight community that we are just like them. The problem with that is that it doesn #8217;t really do much for LGBTQIA that don #8217;t want to/can #8217;t assimilate with  #8216;normal #8217;. When we don #8217;t conform, a lot of the stigma is still present, I mean, just look at some of the responses to drag story time. There are still lots of people equating gay men with peadophiles , especially when we don #8217;t conform to gender norms Edit: I just wanted to add that while I haven #8217;t faced much hostility, I #8217;m also cautious around people I don #8217;t know. I #8217;m very selective about where and when I show PDA. Even in Bristol, which is a very open city, I know people that have faced abuse for holding hands . I would also say that I face a lot of everyday ambivalent homophobia from well meaning ignorance . For example, when I started university, I had a group of straight women fighting over who was going to have me as their gay bestie. The answer was of course non of them. As soon as I failed to live up to their expectations of what a gay man should be like , I.e. their personal shopper, they completely lost interest.</TEXT>

    <DATE>2020-10-10 12:17:38</DATE>
    <TEXT>Hey everyone, so I #8217;m a sociologist and was having a discussion recently with a colleague who was carrying out some covert qualitative observational work but didn #8217;t speak about gender dynamics because he didn #8217;t want to assume the genders of the people he was made observing. I was just wondering what people thought about this. For example, if I think back through my own experience, I can recount countless scenarios where I have been in seminars or at conferences where men speak over women. In many of these instances, I don #8217;t 100% know if they were all actually men because I didn #8217;t get to know them one to one, It #8217;s definitely possible that some of them may have identified differently. However, I still feel that speaking of those gender dynamics, despite some degree of uncertainty , is important. However, I #8217;m definitely open to being challenged on this and I would love to hear everyone else #8217;s thoughts.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Yes, I unpacked this more in one of the other comments but essentially, i think It is legal providing the study is conducted in a public place. However, legal doesn #8217;t mean ethical so in order to get a covert study past an ethics board, the researcher would have to defend their case. Even if legal, there would have to be some major benefits to not informing people to gain ethical approval. Unfortunately, that is all I can tell you. I do not know so much about it because I have never done such studies. The post was in regard to a colleague #8217;s study. My work is never covert. As such, I do always ask for gender. However, if it #8217;s something you want to know more about, I #8217;d recommend googling covert ethnography. Edit: just asked a friend and apparently there can be legal issues to covert research so don #8217;t take my word on the public thing. It #8217;s probably more complicated. Part of applying for ethics would involve navigating any legal issues but . I #8217;m not 100% sure of the details. My friend also told me that ethics would only be approved in cases where there are no alternatives and the participants being aware of the project would significantly alter the results . https://study.cardiffmet.ac.uk/AcSkills/Documents/Research/Research_Ethics_elesson/page_14.htm</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Thanks for sharing. I #8217;m not disagreeing with you on the ethics issues. As I said, I am not the one conducting a covert study here. I #8217;m guessing legality must vary by place and field because I know that they can be conducted in some instances in the UK. They are rare and very hard to get past ethics but they are not always illegal. I mean, journalists record and make observations of people in public all the time. Edit: i think it #8217;s also worth noting that a lot of research uses data made publicly available online, which can in many instances be used for research and journalism. In these instances, individual consent would not always be given but gender dynamics of a particular online platform may still be discussed Edit 2: *The palgrave handbook of ethics in critical research* includes a section of covert research, which includes recent studies . I get that they are very rare but sometimes ethics boards do allow them. https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-319-74721-7_26</TEXT>

For example, I have seen people behaving like cishet men respond to women, trans and queer people calling out their shit with stuff like  #8216;did you assume my gender #8221;. I mean technically, they are right. In many of these instances, we don #8217;t know if someone is male or cishet.

    <TEXT>As someone who is working class, I have a few thoughts on this. Firstly, i agree that it #8217;s not the same as racist terms. However, it is still harmful, entangled in an oppressive history that has reduced working class people #8217;s socio-economic  #8216;failure #8217; to being biologically inferior as a means evading addressing structural issues. I #8217;m also gay and I actually find trash as offensive as many homophobic slurs. Secondly, it doesn #8217;t matter if it is meant with malice. If working class people are uncomfortable with the term, which you acknowledge we have a right to be, it shouldn #8217;t be used. Intention doesn #8217;t erase impact. Good intention is not a defence for using problematic language that justifies and maintains class hierarchies . That said, I do think there are exceptions. I have no issue with a racist white working class person being labelled trash.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I agree that there are different dynamics at play but I #8217;m not sure I agree with justification based on the size of the demographic. That kind of thing could be used to shut down conversations around homophobia and transphobia. Also, i would consider it a classed rather than racialised term because it #8217;s not an attack on a tiny minority of white people; it #8217;s an attack on whole class of people. While it is directed at white people, I actually it has implications for anyone who is working class because it is symptomatic of a society and culture that reduces success and failure to individuals with no regard to the effects of structural inequality. While used against white people, I feel that much of the history surrounding how and why the term has been used is harmful to other marginalised groups disproportionately affected by socio-economic issues. Any effort to address racism without taking class and classism seriously is going to be structurally limited because so much racial inequality is built on a history of inherited wealth.</TEXT>

That would make me a hypocrite if I #8217;m calling people classist. The reason I mentioned my sexuality was to illustrate that classism is a real problem. The person I responded to said it #8217;s not the same as racism, which could be used to shut down the conversation around class. Given that most people accept that homophobia is wrong, I wanted to illustrate that for me, classism has been a bigger issue. It matters, even if it #8217;s different to racism. As for my comment about it being worse than many gay slurs, I used many because I don #8217;t know, and haven #8217;t given much thought to, all the gay slurs that exist for comparison.

I also feel that is ok to call pedophiles and rapists trash. Is that hypocritical in your book? Look, I #8217;m not going into a whole discussion around what is or isn #8217;t homophobic.

I #8217;m in the UK, which is much more class conscious than many other parts of the world. I #8217;m not denying that it may be different where you are so please don #8217;t deny my experience. I know the difference between middle class liberals and middle class activists. I never said the discussion wasn #8217;t happening, I was saying I felt that we could do better. For me , the issue of recognising class is much bigger than white working class people because as I did acknowledge , working class people are more likely to be POC. Class needs to be a strong sticky point for that reason. I #8217;m not talking specifically about the term white trash but class in general. A lot of the focus in the groups I participate in is on culture over material concerns. Lisa Duggan writes a lot about this in her book on homonormativity. Edit: I think it #8217;s also worth noting that just because it #8217;s been talked about doesn #8217;t mean it #8217;s been talked about enough. Activist circles do not operate free from classist, racist and gendered systems of oppression. There is often a tendency for activist circles, like any circles, to centre white middle class voices and concerns. This is something that many activists and scholars criticise. While I #8217;m sure California is very intersectional compared to most places, issues of misogyny, classism and racism will still come into play in woke culture. Owning that and acknowledging that there is always room for improvement is important imo</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I said the world is not California because of your assumption that I was conflating two groups based on your situated experience of those two groups in California. I #8217;m not in California. You could have just asked me whether I was speaking as an active participant in social activist circles or if there was a a chance I was conflating the two. I apologise for being confrontational but I felt you were making assumptions about where I was coming from based on your experiences. As I #8217;m sure you are are aware from your own participation in social justice, there is a problem with marginalised groups within these circles having their experienced downplayed by white middle class activists. As for whether my experience is relevant, I would say yes. It #8217;s not relevant to your location but it is relevant here. White trash is also used here because our society and culture is heavily Americanised. I #8217;d say that everyone outside of the US should be able to participate to these discussions given that US culture and politics has such a massive influence on the rest of the world in a way that the rest of the world doesn #8217;t influence the US. However, I was never saying that my thoughts are more valid. Initially, I only shared my experience. It was you that made the leap to saying my experiences were wrong and based on something they were not. The only thing I asked (admittedly more confrontationally than necessary ) was that you acknowledge that the way in which this term is used and challenged is situated. While it may be given the thought it needs in some places, that is not universal. I #8217;m not arguing that we need to focus on poor white people. I #8217;m arguing that any discourse that operates to reaffirm class boundaries by reducing things associated with socio-economic attributes beyond an individuals control to trash has wider implications because it exposes problematic thinking around success and failure that impacts *everyone* that is working class. The idea that white working class people are failures because they are trash is not entirely disconnected from neoliberal narratives that assume people of colour would be more successful if they worked harder. I #8217;m not arguing that we do not focus on whiteness enough, I #8217;m arguing that we don #8217;t focus on class enough, at least not in the UK. I #8217;m not blaming social justice advocates. As I said, I #8217;m one myself. I #8217;m simply saying that there is still work that I feel could be done in my area. While we may be much more aware than the general population, that doesn #8217;t mean we can #8217;t do better. My position on this is very much influenced by a queer black scholar I saw talk at a queer activist event. He turned around to all the white people in the room and said,  #8216;I know you are all racist because I am too #8217;. His point was that we are all immersed in a biased culture. He went on to talk about how the biggest issue he saw with activist culture was the desire to be woke, as if the world can be divided into those that are woke and those that are not. It is on this basis that I feel that I as activist should acknowledge that while I strive for wokeness, my participation in those spaces is never perfect and can always be reflected on. There is always more that can be done.</TEXT>

I am a gay man but I have been far more limited by class inequality than homophobia (obviously this will vary from place to place). I agree that it is not the same as homophobia and racism, but it is still a systemic issue, rooted in a history that is still made present. White working class people, while historically not denied the right to self-determination anywhere near as much as BIPOC, have still been exploited and restricted throughout history in ways that middle class people haven #8217;t. However, I would agree that racism carries much more baggage because of slavery and colonialism - the worst kind of class exploitation contributing to far more inherited wealth. I am not trying to pit class against race because class exploitation actually harms BIPOC more than white people. However, that doesn #8217;t mean it #8217;s not a structural problem, particularly when this discourse is coming from middle class white people trying to justify their wealth on the basis of working class being trash and not working hard enough. Edit: just to add in response to your point about someone shouting trash on the street, I would say this is where context matters. The example you provided could definitely just be a personal insult, which would be very different from someone shouting f*****. However , if someone was unemployed and someone said, get a job trash, that is then systemic, failing to account for economic inequalities. I #8217;m not objecting to the word universally, just the context in which it is sometimes used which can be classist</TEXT>

    <TEXT>To be honest, based on this last comment, I #8217;m not sure if we do disagree as much as initially thought. I agree that immutable characteristics present different challenges for sure. As I said, as far as sexuality is concerned, I consider classism to be harder but that is very situational based on my experience having grown up with very accepting family in a largely progressive place. As such, for me personally, class has without a doubt been a bigger barrier. However, I wouldn #8217;t compare it to race. I don #8217;t think I need to compare it race to point out it #8217;s shit tbh. There are obviously lots of different fights, which i totally agree can differ in weight but that doesn #8217;t mean they are not structural issues. Just to be clear though, I #8217;m not one of those people that would respond to a BLM post with what about poor white people. I #8217;m only discussing classism because this particular post is questioning if something is classist but I absolutely would never use classism as a way to shut down discussions around gender , racial or sexual inequality. I just wanted to make that clear because I #8217;m aware at how some class activists do that, and I wholeheartedly disagree with such pitting class against identity politics, especially given that as I earlier mentioned, class inequality is something that many marginalised groups face on top of other struggles. Edit: I think it #8217;s important to note that the weight will also vary. For me, someone calling me trash because I am not economically successful and have a strong northern English accent would definitely carry more weight than say queer because I have faced more classism than homophobia. Being gay wouldn #8217;t stop me public speaking, having an accent that people often perceive as thick and uneducated has. However, had I faced major homophobia, I #8217;m sure I would feel differently</TEXT>

    <TEXT>But I never once said your opinion in California doesn #8217;t matter. You were making assumptions about *my* experiences outside of California. In the context of the conversation we were having, the fact that you were from California was not relevant because it meant that you couldn #8217;t speak for what is or isn #8217;t given enough attention in other places, especially not outside the US. The same applies to my experience in England limiting my knowledge of Californian social justice politics. I was not silencing your opinion of activism there in the US. I was silencing your opinion on activism here in the UK, which is valid given that I know more about my own experience than you do. I was challenging what I felt as an attempt to American-splain my knowledge experience. It's probably worth noting that that the "you live in California so you opinion doesn't matter" trope is not a trope outside of the US. One thing that is a massive trope outside the US is some people in the UD assuming that their knowledge and experience is universally valid outside, which is whole other power struggle itself. If you had said you live in say Ohio, my response would have been exactly the same simply because I was defended my perspective from outside. Admittedly, after reading back, I could have been more clear about where I was speaking from early on. However, as a social justice activist, can you not see how people outside the US may be sensitive to Americans expressing skepticism on people discussing politics outside the US? I mean, this does happen a lot , especially online</TEXT>

I'm just going to have to call it out for what it is, I think you may be conflating average white middle class liberals with social justice activists This is more than just scepticism based on your localised experiences of the tensions we were discussing. You said you didn't think what i said was true without even bothering to ask for more details. On a global platform, I find that problematic, especially when you said you were going to calling it out for what *it is*, as if *your* experience in a completely different place gives you some kind of authority on evaluating whether or not my comment was accurate. As I mentioned, I am an activist and academic. The issues around class not being talked about enough is openly discussed in such circles here. That may not be the case in California but it is here. It felt that you were invalidating my experiences by assuming that your experience in a specific place gave you some kind of universal authority on the issue. I never once said your experience in California was wrong, I simply shared my experience from different place and stated that your experience isn't relevant to the context i am working in, which it is not because you are not an activist here.</TEXT>

However, I would not consider this an exclusively US issue. I mentioned not everyone is Californian because that is where your perspective was situated, by your own admission. If you had said another state in the US, I would have said not everyone is from there either. It was never about California. I don #8217;t know enough about California in relation the rest of the US to be able to say what is specifically different about politics there. I just know that it isn #8217;t here, which is where I was commenting. I did not mean to sound like I was doubting your experience there. I do think that your experience of activism there is more valid because I #8217;m an outsider. I wasn #8217;t aware everyone of this thread was assumed to be talking about US politics because as I said, the term white trash is also used here , albeit to a lesser extent because we have alternatives phrases that are often used as well.

It #8217;s probably difficult for you to imagine from within the US but with so many cultures Americanised through US media imperialism, it can be difficult to know which terms originate there, let alone know their full history. These terms take on their own histories in the places they are exported to. Edit: I obviously knew it was used in the US but I had no idea it was so US-specific in terms of its history. What the term has come to mean here is obviously quite different.

    <TEXT>I #8217;m surprised after that train wreck of a discussion I started  #128514;. Thanks for being so patient. As for UK politics, it #8217;s always been my understanding that the UK is much more class conscious. Class is very much embedded in the way people talk and dress. I #8217;ve always been under the impression that class mobility is more restricted here in the sense that even if someone who is working-class has a degree etc, they can remain marked in ways that result in discrimination. I think part of this is entangled aristocracy and some kind of weird historical mixing of caste and class. It #8217;s weird how some people idolise the royal family. In the UK, Working class men, irrespective of race, have only had the vote for 100 years, working class women, again irrespective of race, only for 90 years. Much of the the opposition to allowing working class people to vote was very much grounded in the idea that the working classes were biologically inferior and primitive and incapable of reason and self-determination. Middle class men of colour actually had the right to vote before working class people, although as you can imagine, it was very rare to find middle class men of colour at that time. In short, I #8217;d say that class and racial politics in the UK are much more entangled than in the US. There is a US scholar called Ferguson who wrote a book called *Aberrations of black: A queer of colour critique* , and he talks about how the British middle class actually used what they saw as the  #8216;success #8217; of colonisation and racialisation as a framework for more organised class based oppression. He cites lots of examples about how the middle classes spoke about white working class people before mass immigration. The language used to describe them was very similar to that used to describe people of other racial groups. Lots of fears around lacking the capacity for civilisation and having abnormal reproductive capacities. More than happy to dig out a few quotes for you if you are interested. I was also reading something that suggested that it was only through mass immigration of POC to the UK that the British working class started to see themselves as white and capitalise on it. Up until then, they were considered (and considered themselves) as almost biologically different from the white ruling elite. Interesting fact, the word molly in English used to be used indiscriminately to describe effeminate men, sex workers, sodomites, working class women (and think also working class women of colour) Edit: just wrote all this and realised i misread your comment (again). I don #8217;t not what #8217;s wrong with me. Edit 2: in answer to your interest about how class politics is discussed at present, I #8217;d say that one issue is that the nuance of our racialised and classed history tends to be missed by a lot of activism coming from the US. I #8217;d also say that terms like trash, chav and northerner (someone from the north of England) are thrown around a lot , even within activist circles. Activists circles also tend to ignore class, in ways that make crude generalisations about the values, beliefs and motivations of working class people. I think that this partly because activist circles here are often very white (unless specifically race focused). One thing I #8217;ve noticed here is that people of colour are much more class sensitive probably because they are so effected by class issues. I guess the demographics in the US mean that people of colour, particularly black people, have a much stronger presence in activist circles? If so, perhaps that makes a difference. As someone doing research on queer politics with a heavy focus on class , I actually rely a lot of black feminist literature from the US to bring in discussions of class because a lot of the queer and feminist literature here does not address it well enough</TEXT>

    <TEXT>No problem at all. This makes a lot of sense. I think your distinction between liberals is somewhat applicable here but then liberals here don #8217;t tend to be very involved in activism. Feminist and queer groups for example are often more radical left than liberal in the sense that they acknowledge the need for structural change and oppose the idea of individual choice and freedom , but for some reason, this doesn #8217;t always carry through in how they speak about class. It #8217;s a weird one. There are quite a few interesting intersectional issues relating to class and LGBTQ politics here but mostly because a rural/urban divide, placing many working class LGBTQ people outside of active queer communities, It #8217;s obviously not as intersecting as race and class though, which as you say is a much stronger predictor. Well, this has been nice in the end :-)</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Building on Kage-e #8217;s comment, I would also recommend the work of Sarah Ahmed, who draws on Freud, and Braidotti, who draws on Irigaray. As already mentioned, these theorists oppose psychoanalysis as normalising science instead using it make sense of internal struggles in ways that remain open to fluidity and difference. Walkerdine #8217;s and Jimenez #8217;s book *Gender, work and community* is also a really good one to see Deleuze and Guattari put to use with psychoanalysis. Again, they maintain an open commitment to recognising transformative possibilities of difference beyond binaries while also accounting for affective/emotional constraints. There is also a journal article that looks at the work of the psychoanalyst Melanie Klein alongside Deleuze and Guattari. I can #8217;t remember what it is called atm but I #8217;ll try to dig it out. From reading that, it seems fair to say that anti-Oedipus is not anti-psychoanalysis but anti-oedpialisation (I.e. anti normalisation). Deleuze and Guattari depart from Klein #8217;s notion of the depressive position (I.e. the position at which the subject is held to become contained). However, their szchizoanalysis in many ways resonates with Klein #8217;s paranoid-schizoid position (held as an earlier state of development), which for Deleuze and Guattari is never made whole or complete by linear notions of development). I hope this make sense but let me know if you need further clarification. I would also recommend posting this question to the asksocialscience reddit.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>To be honest, the Klein bit is the bit I know the least about. Everything I have is from that journal article. I #8217;ll dig it out for you this eve and send it over :-). I guess the main connection is that the subject (or non subject) of Deleuze and Guattari is kind of like the pre-Oedipal Kleinian subject, always yet to be and become other as opposed to organised. Like many analysts, Klein #8217;s theory privileged linear developmental narratives. I guess Deleuze and Guattari depart from her in that they theorise  #8216;development #8217; as messy and non-linear, if that makes sense. The object relations of Klein never find order, and certainly can #8217;t be reduced to binary narratives. One thing I found useful for understanding Deleuze and Guattari in relation to psychoanalysis was how they use Nietzschean philosophy. Both Freud and Deleuze and Guattari draw on Nietzsche. For Freud, Nietzsche #8217;s will to power was essentially the polymorphously perverse Id, which through oedipalisation develops an ego structured by the superego. For Deleuze and Guattari, we could say that the polymorphously perverse Id is never fully contained , it that makes sense. The will to power, rather than being structured, is productive, disrupting existing structures and marking out new directions for being and becoming. Even though we are still constrained in various ways, the way in which that constraint plays out is irreducible you fixed narratives. Foucualt #8217;s will to knowledge-power set out along a similar path, considering how power is always contested between bodies as opposed to say Freud that saw power as an outside force. Anyway, I hope this helps. I #8217;ll dig out that article for you later Edit: I also like to the think of these post-Oedipal theories as re-defining things like narcissism and hysteria, psychopathologised by the likes of Freud as a primitive state in opposition to civilisation, as as positive productive force. After all , that which was positioned as narcissistic and primitive was essentially anything that failed to align with the white bourgeois phallocentic order. It is from that excess that we have been able to question the primitive/civilised binary, opening up space for difference. In this sense, the id becomes a site of resistance affording possibilities of social change.</TEXT>

    <DATE>2020-10-16 16:21:02</DATE>
    <TEXT>Hey everyone, I was just wondering whether anyone here knows, or even better knows stuff that has been written about, bisexual people during the gay liberation movement . I #8217;m particularly interested in knowing if it was common for bi people in or looking for same gender relationships to identify as gay to either a) avoid biphobia in the gay community, b) claim immutability of partner options avoid being accused of choosing to be with someone of the same gender, or c) all the above. I #8217;m particularly interested in b.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I really don #8217;t know what to suggest because I #8217;ve never had as much luck with hook ups as you describe on Grindr but I have have developed several great friendships and had a couple of bfs through it, which makes me wonder if it #8217;s anything to do with the types of guys you are meeting. By type, I don #8217;t mean people looking for sex because I was always open to fun along the way. I have a few questions. 1. What kind of guys do you go for? Do you have very rigid expectations around race and masculinity? 2. Which way do you lean politically? 3. Are you out? 4. Where in London do you go out? Do you go to LGBTQ places? If so, are they the commercial ones like G-A-Y or more alternative events attracting a wider range of LGBTQ+ people rather than just mostly gay men and straight women. 5: Is your therapist gay?</TEXT>

    <TITLE>Are there many films or TV series that depict feminine gay men having sex?</TITLE>
    <DATE>2020-10-17 14:03:12</DATE>
    <TEXT>I #8217;m asking this question because I often see people here complain about  #8216;stereotypical  #8216; representations of gay men in the media. However, while there is certainly no shortage of white feminine gay men in the media, I feel that we need to think about quality not just quantity. For example, aside from Emette in Queer as Folk (US), I can #8217;t think of any feminine gay characters that are represented having sex. Femmes are often reduced funny sidekicks rather than sexual beings. When it comes to the representation of gay relationships, It seems that more often than not, sexualised depictions of couples are masc/masc. I don #8217;t think I #8217;ve ever seen a femme/femme couple on screen, and while there are plenty of examples masc/femme couples in popular culture, I feel these couples are often desexualised for a straight gaze. Anyway, I was just wondering if people here feel the same or if I just need to consume more LGBTQ+ media. Also, if anyone is aware of any recent studies on representation, please share :-)</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Yes, that #8217;s what I was thinking. Feminine gay men are not treated as whole. It #8217;s superficial. I #8217;d actually argue that it is the desexualised and sanitised nature of those representations that makes them often seem stereotypical Because they are not represented fully . However, since we started talking one positive fully representation of feminine gay male sexuality did just occur to me. The gay character in Orphan Black If you know the series. That said, the fact that i can only think of him and someone from a series that finished over 15 years ago speaks volumes!</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Ah fair. The reason I asked the first question was to get a sense whether you were arranging these things based on just looks because that could be a barrier to something more meaningful but it doesn #8217;t sound like that #8217;s the case , which is great. By political leaning I mean are you left or conservative. I ask because a lot of gay guys are left leaning, and I imagine that #8217;s even more the case in London. Political differences can be barrier. Great to hear that you are trying to meet people in bars and stuff but I get that it #8217;s strange alone, especially at the moment. Personally, I find the commercial gay spaces quite difficult for meeting guys. I don #8217;t go to LGBTQ spaces often but I tend to find more alternative events much better for meeting guys. I think a lot of gay people London forget that there is so much community stuff going on outside of places like Soho. I #8217;m glad to hear you have had LGBTQ therapists. I ask because they will likely understand the different challenges we have meeting people. From what I know of London, I actually think you may have more luck in the South of the city but probably not until after lockdown. Everywhere is going to be hard atm</TEXT>

    <TEXT> gt; Why should I prioritize the feelings of man reading a tweet that might make him uncomfortable over a woman who just went through a pretty scary thing? I so agree with this. I #8217;m a man but if a friend posted something like this, I wouldn #8217;t take it as an insult. I #8217;d check in and see if they are ok. It #8217;s like when my female friends have had bad relationships and say  #8216;fucking men #8217; to blow off steam. Sometimes they make a point of telling me they don #8217;t mean me  #8216;because I #8217;m gay #8217; but it #8217;s really not necessary. I get that they #8217;re venting. Also, it #8217;s not like men don #8217;t vent. From how people go on about the whole men a trash thing, you #8217;d thing that no man ever had vented and generalised about women after abuse or cheating etc. I definitely grew up hearing things that equates to women are trash waaaay more than the opposite, and I think that remains true today</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I see masculinity as fluid and not tied to specific bodies. I #8217;d say my understanding of masculinity is very much influenced by how the trans* scholar Jack Halberstam sees it in their book on female masculinity, if you know it. I would reject people that try to tie masculinity manhood because I see masculinity as nothing more than a set of traits socially constructed as masculine - traits that both men , women and non-binary people can adopt. In reality, I think we all embody a mix of traits coded as masc/fem. i Identify as feminine not because i #8217;m a woman and not because I don #8217;t embody any masculine coded traits but because things coded as feminine appeal to me much more. So are you saying people identifying and trans-masculine shouldn #8217;t use masculine as a descriptor because if you are saying there is nothing someone can identify with as masc or fem, it invalidates the possibility of being trans-masculine.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I agree with you if masculinity is assumed to be tied to specific bodies but I don #8217;t experience gender that way. I am a man and identify as feminine. While I agree that these words are constructs, we live in a gendered world and the ways things are coded so have a real impact on our sense of self and expression. I accept that femininity is a construct but it doesn #8217;t stop me from feeling feminine because in the world I #8217;ve been socialised, things coded as masculine generally haven #8217;t appealed to me. I feel that not using these terms can go the other way where instead of being gender bound we become gender blind . I definitely agree with you critique about masculinity being reduced to manhood and held In opposition to women but I think it can be redefined, as Halberstam does.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I feel that this is easier to say for those who are read as gender conforming. For me, femininity is absolutely a thing because as a queer man, I have regularly faced shit for transgressing masculinity by identifying with things coded as feminine. I don #8217;t see femininity as belonging to women though because as I said , i #8217;m a man. A trans-masculine person similarly may face shit for not identifying with feminine coded things. These labels may be social constructs but they real impact on us. I #8217;d actually go as far as to say that someone assigned male identifying with masculine coded traits should acknowledge that as masculine because with that comes a hell of a lot of privilege denied to men that are queer, trans and gender non-conforming . I #8217;ll stop identifying as feminine with pride when the world allows me to just be without shame</TEXT>

    <TEXT> gt; I see it the oposite way. A non gendrr conforming person should see the danger of this classification because it leads to discrimination. It leads to people policing others and punishing them for not following the gender norms. Interesting. I can definitely see your point but only up to the point of tying masculinity to manhood, which is why I like Halberstam #8217;s effort to deconstruct that. However, while I absolutely reject such gender boundness, i don #8217;t feel being completely blind to masculinity as helpful either . I guess I #8217;m somewhere in the middle of your position and the traditional use of such terms, thinking both with and beyond them. Always open to red-defining them. I worry that completely eradicating them is problematic for a similar reason being colour blind is problematic. While gender and race are obviously very different, the the history of classifying people by skin colour is also a social construct. However, it obviously has real effects that justify people recognising racial categories. People (usually white) have claimed to resist racism on the ground of refusing to use racial categories but such efforts are always structurally limited at bringing about change. I don #8217;t know. I guess we will have to agree to disagree on this one. I don #8217;t think we are miles apart because I definitely agree with your critique of how these terms are often used, and I absolutely agree that the way in which the OPs masculinity is defined is massively problematic , but I feel it doesn #8217;t have to be this way. I feel we can break down the gender binary through acknowledging feminine men, masculine women, men and women that embody both, enby people that are masc/fem/both etc. For me, it #8217;s the reduction of masculinity to sex that is the issue rather than the term itself</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I think the title is self explanatory but I #8217;m essentially interested in any historical literature on bisexuals identifying as gay or lesbian, whether that be to distance themselves from accusations of choosing to be with someone of the same gender or because they felt pressured by the gay community to do so. I #8217;ve come across a few things but really not that much exploring gay/bisexual identity politics during the gay lib movement</TEXT>
