    <TEXT>Half the things in greys anatomy. i cant handle the show because they dont even try to get medical procedures even slightly accurate. I watched a patient code and they just slapped a finger on the neck for two seconds and declared the patient gone. Like man i know its a drama but it urks me as someone who worked in the hospital especially because people always go oh u want to work in medicine? Its cause of greys anatomy isnt it?</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Sometimes. i like being able to eat as much sweets as I want and not have to worry about burning it off. But because of this i never learnt to eat healthy or make it a habit to excersice because i thought i didnt need it. Now im diabetic and suffer from multiple health issues and i can barely sustain my existance. So id rather honestly learn to work to stay fit than have taken advantage of it. Sure my metabolism is still really good and despite being diabetic people dont believe me because im super skinny but its not fun feeling like this.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Honestly probably gonna get real downvotes here but most black people i know have always tried to compete about race. As if they are the only race to experience racism. Yes you guys have experienced racism, alot, but you gotta keep in mind anyone who isnt white will experience it as well. I think people who experience racism should help empathize with others and create a safe space where people can share and understand what the other is going through. Its also very dependant what area or country you grow up because one poc may experience it and one may never or not as bad. So try to tell her u need to create a safe space where u can understand each other because honestly it seems to me like she only wants to be the biggest victim and consume all the pity in the world.</TEXT>

    <TITLE>My life is falling apart and i dont know what to do</TITLE>
    <DATE>2020-10-02 00:51:45</DATE>
    <TEXT>So a little background, ive been diagnosed with depression, anxiety since I was in elementary school and ptsd when I got into high school. I went on some meds for a year but felt like the side effects were worse than the help so I weaned off them. I was redoing my uni semester since im a really ill person and was in the hospital too much last year. And I failed and got kicked out. It was only one course but because i failed last semester there was no redoes. I begged the proff to pass me by a little but she refused. My parents were super dissapointed. I saw this as an oppurtunity to go into something i really wanted to do. I wasnt to interested in my degree anyways and with my health I wouldnt even be able to do the job if i graduated. I thought i was fine with failing but honestly I subconciously just gave up on life. I dont know what I want to do, i felt like school was holding me together. Now my parents wont help me anymore because im not going into what they wanted. I lack motivation for anything and i cant seem to keep myself interested in anything. Ive tried different things that I enjoy but because they arnt as good as other peoples work I lose my shit. Right now im trying to find a full time job so I can get myself and my boyfriend out of this shit basement I live in, where the landlord refuses to change the vents because there is no air flow, and the landlord also eavesdrops all the time its super creepy and his kids wont leave us alone and bang on the door to see our pets. My boyfriend has offered some leaverage that as soon as he finishes his last year he will take over and i can take my time to find what i want to do even if it doesnt make alot of money. I really appreciate it but I feel like a failure at everything! Everything I try. I see these people who make average stuff get super popular and i just cant seem to get a hit. I tried making webcomics but no one read them. I tried making singing videos but no one saw them. I beat myself down for it. I dont know what direction to take my life in. And being cramped in this small basement with no air or light really takes a toll and its made our relationship very tense. The job interview i went for hasnt called me back. Im stressing on finding work. Im stressing about being here. Im depressed about where my life has turned out. I honestly feel like id be better dead. Nothing is going my way.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Oh hell no, honestly she is the type of person to say the truth in a joking matter. She is also the type of person to think having a disability is a joke and everything to help the disabled is just serving then and them getting their way instead of how it actually helps them. Whats a short walk to her from that parking space is the equivalent effort of walking from the end of the parking lot to the grocery store for people with disabilities. She is taking advantage of you.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Im very similar too and fully understand your chronic pain complaint. Ive been diagnosed with lupus, fibromyalgia, arthritis, etc u get the point. I had to drop out of school because my body cant handle anything and im so scared of being useless and feel like I have no future. Honestly though what ive been learning is a) have someone very supportive either yourself or someone else or both who will let u take your pace and take it easy. B) i found my passion through drawing, and id take it easy every day doing a bit until my body couldnt handle anymore. Try to find a passion where u dont have to exhaust yourself. It really helps. Also keeps your mind off things you know</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I would try changing your unit. Im going to guess your a nurse (correct me if im wrong) and psychiatric wards are TOUGH they drain your mental health. Try to switch hospitals or units. That could alleviate some stress. As for your boyfriend i cant really comment as i dont know the situation but hopefully with alleviated stress it alleviates the situation</TEXT>

    <TITLE>Terrible psychiatric doctors</TITLE>
    <DATE>2020-10-10 04:50:55</DATE>
    <TEXT>I have had a very long history of multiple mental illnesses as well as physical and needless to say ive had terrible luck with doctors and health care workers. When I was first diagnosed with fibromyalgia and Lupus I saw a social worker and paychiatrist who instantly diagnosed me with anxiety, PTSD, depression, ED. That was written in my file. But i never actually acted upon it. My mom always told me itll just go away and i didnt need to go see a specialist. Things didnt get better and i saw a therapist. She told me i should be on meds and therapy. I tell my doctor and he refuses. I continue to beg and he makes me see a psychiatrist at a hospital first. So i go, as i walk in im super nervous. And when i get nervous i giggle and smile alot. So after he asked me a few questions he just looks at me and says  #8220;yeah u dont have depression your too happy. Dont worry itll get better u dont need help #8221;. My therapist forces my doctor to put me on meds, and here I am still cutting and crying. I dont know why i feel like im not taken seriously. Why do I have to beg to be treated?</TEXT>
