    <TITLE>Illusion of Gaia, a Forgotten Gem, Was My Childhood</TITLE>
    <DATE>2020-07-31 21:57:31</DATE>
    <TEXT>When I was a kid, my family wasn't the most well off in the world, but my parents both worked their asses off to make sure my sister and I had happy childhoods. I got my SNES near the end of it's lifespan, and with it, a little game called "Illusion of Gaia". Before I played this game, I had no idea that video games could have stories beyond "Go from left to right, and save the princess". But this game, while it had a few translation errors that created plotholes, blew my 10 year old mind. It had everything I had seen in the movies and read in books: Action, adventure, relatable characters, a story that I wanted to see to it's end, young romance, etc. Hell, this was the first video game that legit made me cry, and that was when  gt;!Hamlet, the sweet little pig! lt; died. This is the game. This is when I truly became a gamer, and could appreciate the medium as an art form. Hell, this was the first game I ever streamed on Twitch, and put up on YouTube. If you want to watch it, I'll link to it, but, honestly, I think you should play it yourself. If you're a fan of SNES RPGs, then it's an experience that you don't want to rob yourself of. It's truly meant to be played, not watched. [My LP of Illusion of Gaia](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W5Qgj3ae-_0)</TEXT>

Why would they deny themselves easy revenue? I assure you the problem lies on the Nintendo side.
