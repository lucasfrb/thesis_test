    <TEXT>I mean the thing about feeling good that your boyfriend finds you attractive doesn #8217;t indicate anything in particular to me. As a bi guy I sometimes used like femme things that appeal to men even if I in other contexts would feel uncomfortable with those femme roles. I know you said you can #8217;t find a therapist, perhaps reading some books ob the subject would help; I don #8217;t think strangers online diagnosing based off your description of your life is the best thing the trans community does personally. To me it very much sounds like you could be trans, but I don #8217;t know you or a lot of details that may be relevant. Transitioning is scary, its a big deal. But if you are at a point of lamenting not being a cis dude, you may have to do more thinking and searching within yourself before you can decide what is worth it for you.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Yo thats shitty of her, and not on you at all. As a trans person herself she knew damn well that if the roles were reversed and she was thought of as a boy that she would hate that. It #8217;s really hard to get over relationship issues but I think being open with your GF about your worries about this stuff would help if you are not already. I bet that she sees you as you and that as a bi girl it makes no difference to her anyways whether you are cis.</TEXT>

Here #8217;s the thing: If you misgendered someone who says theyre nondysphoric trans; they will react right? It will make them feel bad/uncomfortable..they will get upset.

    <TEXT>Yeah that #8217;s the thing is I totally understand being a feminine man, I don #8217;t want people here thinking I don #8217;t; I #8217;ve been living as I want for years now and sometimes I dress up femme/androgynous artistically. It #8217;s fun! It #8217;s fun seeing people #8217;s reactions reading me as a man wearing stuff  #8220;men aren #8217;t supposed to, #8221; But before I could medically transition it was my experience that I had wayyyy more scrutinizing voices in my head of my appearance and while I #8217;d try to be my own style I always wanted to make sure it would balance out to not being read as a girl as best I could. I don #8217;t WANT others to be as self deprecating as I was, it just makes me curious what their ultimate goal would be if they could look any way because clearly something a little different than I was thinking back then.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>This is very interesting to me. I understand the knee jerk reaction a lot of trans men have, because it sounds so much to them like something other people have told them they were and that makes them uncomfortable. Myself I never identified as a lesbian at any point, but discovering stories about lesbians before I came out as trans was an empowering thing because it poked a whole in the cis male centered image of sex I was used to. I want to try to look more into these identities and the basis for them; I do admit they seem a little contradictory at face value but maybe the feelings that he/him lesbians feel are contradictory to one another?</TEXT>

I understand! truly; feeling like you dont wanna self diagnose but nobody is diagnosing you amd you just want to explain what is going on; the exes and the not wanting to put your pain on them but opening up to them because you just trust them; I #8217;m sure we have very different lives but I want to reply anyway. Sometimes my feelings fluctuate so much it really doesnt make sense to me. within the same day I #8217;ll feel like things are looking up and feel like I want to slip away into death. It is truly wild but I guess it #8217;s just a symptom of our human complexity. If you want to talk about what you left out here or start a project together as a distraction, HMU.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Now, as for the advice thing: I FEEL you on the breakup. When my first ex and I broke up I COULD NOT RESIST texting them or leaving voicemails etc. I just did not know how to accept someone being out of my life who I had been so intensely intimate with. I knew it was over but I didnt understand how there really wasnt going to be some kind of friendship. I watched and read too many love stories growing up I guess. ANYWAY, I dont want it to take burning the bridge completely as it did for me to move on. I want to tell you that people really cant always handle as much as they thought they could; and they say things that are intense and backtrack on them later. It sucks, it TOTALLY sucks and there isnt an excuse for it but you dont want to give your ex the chance to cause more pain, which is what every unwanted message is ultimately. Again, DM me if u ever want. I had a suicidal post on here i think i deleted that someone replied to and hot me up and we are online friends now. It can help. xxx - Maja (19m)</TEXT>

    <TITLE>Dr. Maercks phallo technique?</TITLE>
    <DATE>2020-06-04 12:31:33</DATE>
    <TEXT>Hi I am looking for anyone who has gone to dr. maercks in miami fl, or is familiar with his technique of phallo which uses two groin flaps instead of the arm technique. Innervation from the clitoral nerve is concentrated near the head of the phallus. Anyway I #8217;m trying to do more research into this and Maercks caught my eye because of the different technique and apparently lack of need for an implant, but I wanted to look into this more before talking to his office. I #8217;m curious about if there are other people doing similar things, and if there #8217;s anywhere for info that anyone knows of. General phallo research tips are appreciated.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>yeah you gotta out some search work in but it #8217;s worth it ! I recommend  #8220;a strange sort of being: the transgender life of lucy anne/ joseph isreal lobdell #8221; by bambi lobdell it #8217;s about a cool trans man in american history. Sad what ultimately happened to him but an amazing person aside from transcending norms in such a strict time.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>saying someone shouldn #8217;t get fired for that is pretty fair. it probably wasn #8217;t even intentional. And her recent stuff wasn #8217;t even transphobic she literally said  #8220;I know and love trans people #8221;</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Yeah learning about FTM history is rad because people don #8217;t talk about us so much, there is no POSE including us (yet). Lou Sullivan is one of the most famous. Also, even though they weren #8217;t gay, Joseph Isreal Lobdell who was around in the turn of the century from late 1800 #8217;s to early 1900 #8217;s is a super cool person to learn about, there is a book about him  #8220;a strange sort of being. #8221; And Reed Erickson was a wild one too! for more info and more guys check out this site it can get you started!

    <TEXT>How would you compare the sensation to chest recovery? I am well healed (from top surgery) and over a year post op but for a long time it was this weird in between of being able to feel but not on the very top surface of the skin, only the nerves / muscle underneath.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I am just starting the process myself of figuring out my phallo journey and I #8217;d say in the USA health insurance makes a HUGE difference - I #8217;ve heard without coverage it can ACTUALLY cost a million. I don #8217;t know where we are at with the trump admin and requirements but there are certainly some insurance companies that cover it still.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>This! When I am doing active stuff I pack with socks, an ankle sock can roll into itself to become a round little bulge - it #8217;s important to remember how different a flaccid dick is, also I think really packers are more likely to swing around or slip cause of their weight. pinning one of those socks into tighty-whitey length underwear works well for a secure pack without clunkiness.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>you say not to comment, but here you are posting. you didn #8217;t just write it in a journal somewhere and it #8217;s for a reason. Idk much about your life and whats available to you, but I know walking with a foot amputated isn #8217;t easy and modern medicine would choose to exhaust all other options before even considering removing a whole foot from the body, if u get my extension of your own metaphor. I believe you, its probably every bit as shitty and guilty as you say it is but you don #8217;t know everything behind the change in dynamic in your family. You may see them be taken aback, see them seeing you feel this way knowing that you have a bright mind, and be too clumsy to know how to act. If you can #8217;t get a job, start with finding a thing or two to go out and do just for the fuck of not being online all the time. Doesn #8217;t matter if its whack. I used to go visit old graves and write notes to the people inspired by the clues I could pick up from their gravestone. Find a book you #8217;re interested in and go for a short walk from your home with it and read a chapter and then go home. Whatever, you know? It #8217;s so shitty to feel like a burden but getting outside yourself is crucial for your family as well as you. These words aint empty!</TEXT>
