    <TITLE>How does Instagram know my phone number?</TITLE>
    <DATE>2019-02-06 16:48:16</DATE>
    <TEXT>I"ve experienced something really weird. Is there a way that IG is able to detect the phone number of the SIM card in your phone? I've literally never entered my phone number into my Instagram account. It is a business account, but I want to keep my number private. Yet somehow today I received this weird notification inside the app prompting me to enter my phone number as a security measure. But the strange thing is that within this message, it actually had my current phone number.  #8203; The message said something to the effect of: "enter your phone number: \*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\* (my number) into your profile details". How did they get my phone number in the first place??? Do they trace the phone number of your SIM card? Is it a matter of other contacts having your number? Please can someone explain, and have you experienced anything similar.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>No, I've never done so. So this really weird. I didn't enter my phone number nevertheless. But I can't understand how they managed to get it to start with... I don't know if would be too drastic to change my phone number now or what.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Hi there. I've been experiencing something very similar to what you have described. When I think something, someone says precisely what I said out loud, or it happens sometime later. I've also had many other experiences similar to this. I just took interest in you question because I'm the same, but unfortunately I cannot answer why or what this is. All I can say is, you're defo not crazy lol</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I'm not psychic or at least I don't believe I am. I don't belong to this subreddit either. I was just on here looking for answers in the same way as you, because I can't explain some of the uncanny occurrences that have happened to me.  #8203; I actually consider myself more "logically minded" if that makes sense, like I would typically seek rational answers to things as opposed to just believing the paranormal. However, based on the experiences I've had which are very similar to what you're describing, I can't help but feel there really is something else at play.  #8203; Even the real-time experience you described. There was an occasion where I was typing out a comment on a friend's instagram post, and right then, the radio host said precisely what I wrote in a sentence. Coincidence?? idk. It's really weird, I do think we're somehow manifesting our thoughts into the world, and seeing the universe react subsequently.  #8203; Anyway, I hope you find the answers you're looking for. And know there's at least one person out there who thinks you're perfectly sane. ;)</TEXT>

    <TITLE>What Wifi Router do you recommend for Google Home/Smart Homes?</TITLE>
    <DATE>2019-07-11 12:39:20</DATE>
    <TEXT>I'm new to the space of smart homes. I've been doing a bit of research before making purchases and getting started with building my own smart home. I've decided I'd like to go for Google Home primarily. My question is whether the wifi router I choose to use matters, and if so, what are the best options available. Interestingly enough I've managed to find articles about recommendations for Alexa, but not really for Google Home?  #8203; I live in a double story home with brick interior walls, so I need something that will be strong in terms of connectivity throughout the house.  #8203; Should I go for Google Wifi, and are there any other alternatives to look at for optimum performance in my home?</TEXT>

    <TITLE>People believe we had conversations that never happened</TITLE>
    <DATE>2020-01-30 14:17:33</DATE>
    <TEXT>I've experienced on a couple of occasions now, that people seem to think we had discussions that never took place. They are convinced that I told them things that I am entirely certain I did not say at any point in time. Today for instance, my dad was telling me that about a year or so ago, I supposedly told him that I was seeing people's faces contorting with blood all over their faces. I was horrified over what he was saying, not only because it sounded really bizarre and grizzly, but also because I know for a fact I did not say any of the above. I'm 100% certain I did not say this. Yet people around me are convinced that things happened that didn't happen, or we had conversations that didn't take place. Not sure if it would have any relevance, but have also been experiencing odd coincidences and synchronicities. My reality feels a little weird overall. Any thoughts?</TEXT>

    <TEXT>They're not all as dark as that. Other examples: Some months back I was talking on the phone with a friend of mine about a trip to Cape Town, South Africa with my family I'd gone on a few months prior. I saw a doctor about a week after this conversation with my friend. I was having severe migraines (hence seeing the doctor). Towards the end of the session my doctor was like "so how was your trip to Cape Town?" I was really puzzled because I never mentioned this to him at the beginning of the appointment, or to anyone else at the doctor's office for that matter. He seemed really confused when I asked how he knew about the trip. And he insisted I told him at the beginning. I'm 1000% sure I didn't. Nobody asked me about vacations I'd taken. There was another time my mom was upset because I apparently said that she wanted to steal my jewellery and sell it for money. Again I never said this. This was the cause of a lot of drama, and I was confused as heck. I've had more experiences. This stuff doesn't happen all the time, but today with my dad was the first in a while.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>It's not so much that I was hoping anything would happen. It's just that I wanted understanding as to what is going on and how to make my life return to normal. I understand that I was a little vague in my initial post. I will try to elaborate. I have experienced some inexplicable occurances. As to whether they're entirely negative, I'm not sure, but I view that fact that some seemingly paranormal things have happened, as a negative thing overall. (I prefer normalcy in my life). 1) I have witnessed physical objects moving. Like a pan shifting off the plate while I was cooking. I was alone and this scared me. 4) I also feel like I'm being watched because I actually saw shadow people in my room on an occasion. There were two of them just looking at me. 2) I have encountered people who just seems to know things about me, very personal inward things I've thought about, and things I've done while I was alone. It makes me feel like I'm being watched. This is what bothers me the most. How do they just know things? My doctor just asked me about a trip Cape Town I had been on some months back, and I hadn't mentioned anything about it before to him? 5)There was one time I was describing a scene from a film to my brother, I couldn't remember the name of the film, and then I heard a whisper in my ear telling me what the name was. I was unsure so I went and watched that film (the one that had been whispered to be by something?) only it find that that was in fact the film. The whisper also freaked me out. 6) I know it sounds bizarre. After deciding to start my own business, I have felt pretty down about not earning as much as I had hoped for. I'm still determined to make my business work, but I keep seeing these messages everywhere (like on Instagram captions, or videos on YouTube) saying things like Get a Job! Get a regular Job! (I work from home). It almost feel intentional. Like someone/something is intending me to see it. I accept I may be wrong on this. Also people taking about things I've dreamed about (like the thing with my dad)</TEXT>

    <DATE>2020-04-27 11:05:20</DATE>
    <TEXT>I really wasn't sure where to post this, but I'm hoping someone can help. I've been wondering whether there is a spiritual reason behind relationships changing drastically between myself and people I would generally get along with, or people who ordinarily wouldn't notice me at all. I'm experiencing a sudden rise in negativity, and also people acting completely out of character. People who generally would be kind and caring (like my family) are now being sarcastic and condescending. And when I sit and genuinely try and place a reason for the shift in how I relate with others, even considering my own flaws I can't find a reason for them to suddenly be behaving so differently towards me. Part of the reason I thought this would be a spiritual issue is because I've also been experiencing number of really wild synchronicities. I feel this odd interconnectedness between things, but it really feels negative and uncomfortable. Some advice would be highly appreciated. Why would people be behaving so differently towards me all of a sudden?</TEXT>

    <TITLE>When you manifest someone, do they enter you life or into a relationship willingly.</TITLE>
    <DATE>2020-05-02 18:50:50</DATE>
    <TEXT>I'm relatively new to law of attraction and so I don't know a whole lot to be honest. I truly hope I don't upset anyone. I'm just trying to understand the principles of manifesting a person into your life or manifesting a relationship etc. Some months back I saw some videos on how to manifest a text from a particular person. And to my surprise I was successful the first time around. The person texted me, we spoke and after a while they asked me out. I was actually able to do this with a few different people. I couldn't believe it was actually happening. But my question is, is the person actually doing this of their own accord? What inspires them to contact you? Is it really them that's doing it? The reason I ask this, is just that I found that one of the guys, for example, texted me, but it's like they didn't really know why they did it or what to say. Another guy was quite rude actually, and I got the sense that he didn't actually want to hang out with me, and so I didn't understand why he reached out in the first place. Like what was the point if they weren't genuinely interested? Loa is great and all, but I'm bothered by the feeling that people are just puppets, doing something solely because I asked. Does it come from a real place?</TEXT>

    <DATE>2020-05-03 08:15:34</DATE>
    <TEXT>Over the last few months, I have increasingly felt like my life is governed and controlled by some unseen entity/force. Things that should feel arbitrary and random, somehow feel orchestrated or staged. Sometimes too convenient. Like something or someone is very knowingly messing with me. What brought this feeling on, is the experience of very inexplicable coincidences. Some call them synchroncities. They feel very uncanny and deliberate. I feel like sometimes people just say the right things, like very specific to what I've already been thinking. Which feels odd. I sometimes feel like I don't really get a perspective different to mine, when I reach out to other people. I don't know how to rid myself of the feeling that something greater than me is out there and is at play in my life. Knowing and calculating my every move. Is this a delusion?</TEXT>

    <TEXT>There are times in my life where I've taken preventative measures to ensure something doesn't occur, and yet somehow it does. For instance, there were people in my life I was actively trying to avoid, and so did everything I could to separate myself from them to ensure we don't encounter each other again. I felt a sort of comfort in the measures I'd taken. I felt for sure I'd never see or hear from them again, and somehow, they still find their way to me. Also when I've fleetingly told myself, I don't want someone to ask me for something, then they do. But the positive fleeting thoughts don't happen. I'm just questioning, why is it, when you do want something to happen, according to LOA, you must meditate and then forget about it. However when you don't want something to happen, thinking about it often makes it happen. Why is this the law.</TEXT>

I was having some issues with my explore page at one stage, but I managed to sort it out. You're going to have to keep doing this until it comes right. So basically, if you open the particular on your explore page, click on those three dots at the top. In the menu that pops up, there should be an option for "not interested" or something to that effect. If you keep doing this for all the disturbing images that appear, the instagram algorithm should learn to show fewer images like that. Good luck!</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Thank you for your different perspective. I have never heard of that. However *if* that were the case, I must say, that as a doctor offering medical advice to someone, he should have explained what he meant, when I asked. If it was a joke/reference to some folklore, it would have helped to make it clear. The whole reason I felt he had some dubious and negative undertone, was because he brushed me off. Almost as if he didn't want to own what he was really saying.  #8203;  gt;Was he (or are you) Jewish, Muslim, or Seventh Day Adventist? I don't know his religion actually, nor do I belong to those.

    <TITLE>Why do people always laugh at me?</TITLE>
    <DATE>2020-07-13 12:40:40</DATE>
    <TEXT>I am generally a reserved an introverted person personality wise. I like to think I'm someone who treats other people well and with respect. I'm not rude generally, and I often get told I'm kind. What I can't figure out is, why do people always laugh at me without explanation. There've been times where I've confronted the people in question head on. But they always either deflect and insist that they weren't laughing at me (even though they were looking right at me), or they just keep quiet. There was one time I was sitting alone in a coffee shop near the campus of my college. There were several other people seated there alone and working on their laptops as well. This other guy who I studied with literally walked into the coffee shop and came to where I was sitting and started laughing. He was like "Haha, so you're just sitting here on your own lol." Up until now I genuinely don't understand what was so humorous about the situation. Why was it funny? Whenever I try to put myself in the position of these people and figure out why something is worth laughing at, I can't place it. I don't see it? I feel like I present myself well. I shower, I dress decently, I do my hair and a little makeup. So I don't think I'm out there just looking a mess hence people laugh. Is it my quiet demeanour? Do I physically look strange? I can't figure out what is wrong with me. Why would people just laugh at someone?</TEXT>

    <TITLE>Does being polite and introverted make other people more inclined to be rude to you?</TITLE>
    <DATE>2020-07-15 08:45:09</DATE>
    <TEXT>I experience people being notably rude towards me a lot. I am an introvert, so I am quiet natured overall. But I do think I treat other people well, as I am less inclined to be conflictual or mean. Does this personality type make one more prone to being mistreated? I just find that people are usually sarcastic and in some cases derogatory towards me. And I can't figure out why as I was communicating well with them. For instance, I had a lecturer at university who literally cursed me out in front of everyone, because SHE had misplaced one of my essays. She found it afterwards, but I can't imagine she would have spoken to anyone else like that. She seems very talkative and welcoming towards other people. I understand that there are assholes out there in the world. Not everyone is nice, I know. But I experience this quite often, and I'm wondering if my personality is the problem. Do I seem meek, hence people feel bold enough to be disrespectful? *edit: do people dislike people who are polite and/or introverts?</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Thank you so much. You don't understand how incredibly reassuring it is to encounter someone who knows exactly what I am talking about. This has been a rather lonely experience. I've been so confused. It's like wandering in the dark with no sense of direction.  gt;I #8217;ve avoided crowds, and other people, and it started coming through in other ways. Yes. Exactly. EXACTLY!! The wildest things have happened. The craziest synchronicities. I've also received external answers to questions I've had only on the inside. It's only in moments like these where I find a little peace as it doesn't seem all that bad. But it has been a very drastic contrast between what my previous normal was, and what it is now. And so, naturally, my mind wants to revert to what felt like home before.  gt;Our entire planet is going though some fairly abrupt changes, right now. Yes. I did recognise early that things are very strange, as of late. The world definitely feels like it has shifted. But I am still trying figure out for what reason. What is going on? Why was awakening necessary? I'm hoping I will find these answers eventually. I will be on the look out for people I can connect with on this level in real life. It must be really nice for you to have people who don't meet you with scepticism or doubt, and who share in your experience.

    <TEXT>Thank you. I agree with your theory about sending and receiving. I have experienced people doing things that I was thinking about doing. But the more common one is them saying what I've thought to my self. It's very undeniable and precise. It is very frustrating when people just respond to me with my own thought, because then it feels like I'm just talking to myself, in a weird way. I really hope I can get a handle on this, if it is possible to control it. My best case scenario is if I can make it dormant, to be honest.

    <TEXT>I used to feel like this. I would feel all excited and proud of a photograph, eager to post it. And then some later, regret that I posted it. But I've learned two things from this: 1) The only reason why the image feels like it's distorted or not good enough after you've posted it, is because you've spent too long looking at it and analyzing it, and nit-picking minor flaws that nobody else would notice. Over familiarity from studying the image for too long is what makes the brain tired of it, or even makes it develop an aversion to it. 2) Most people are inundated with visuals on Instagram. They come across many posts. Honestly, no one is fixating on your post as much as you probably think they are, because very shortly after seeing your post, they will see another, and then another after that. While people may take the time out to regard your post by liking it, but no one is really focusing on the minor details that much at all. This is very helpful to know, when you start to feel insecure. I think sometimes when things concern ourselves, perceived imperfections seem much more significant than they are to the next person. You pictures are probably just perfectly fine, and you're over thinking it.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Thank you for your response. However, I have to kindly disagree with this theory. The reason why I disagree is because, people have at times told me deeply personal thoughts that I've had. Stuff that is specific to me and very private. Things I haven't told anyone. I'm not simply referring to generic ideas that simply could have been in the atmosphere. This is why this whole issue is very problematic to me, and I need to find a way to make it stop. It's like I have no personal space. The only thing is, as other commenters have mentioned, when I question what the person says, or how they know, they always give some random answer. Other people don't seem to be aware they are receiving in this way. I do believe there is something taking place at an underlying spiritual level here, however, I don't think it is a matter of me being the minds of others in the way you describe.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Hi. To answer your question, my experience is similar for the most part, particularly with reference to what you're saying about timing. It always feel a little bit too convenient or coincidental.  gt; (Unsurprising you might say, because the water was really clear and other people could notice and comment on it too, but the timing was odd.) This is where I find my experience sort of differs from yours. I'm not saying your experience is not real, so please don't misunderstand me. I have definitely experience what you're describing at times. People don't always necessarily tell me about things that are commonly agreeable. That is, we're both in the same situation, hence we're both likely to think the same thing, or to make the same inferences based on reasoning. This is not the case. What I'm experiencing is that people, in some cases, repeat really personal things, private things, that I've that I've never told anyone or thought only to myself. Or sometimes, if it's not private per se, it's just very oddly specific. As in, it's not just a thought that we both could have had, because we are both in the same situation at the same time. Examples: 1) I run an internet based business. I was searching online for some very specific products online for the sake of my business. These were totally new products, and somewhat unrelated to what I typically sell on the website. I never discussed this with anyone. Never mention these products, or my interest in them, to a soul. Later that very same day, my dad was like "I know you've been searching for "x" for your business". I was completely shocked. I asked how he knows. Why would he just think I need this unrelated product for my business?? He seemed not to know why he said that at all. 2) I very briefly dated a guy named \*Frederick (not really his name)..He was from Europe. It was very brief. Just a few dates. Because of how incredibly short-lived the whole thing was, I had never mentioned him or his name to anybody. Not to my friends or family or anyone. A couple of months down the line, after the whole thing had passed, my brother just casually brought his name in a conversation. He was was like, "Remember that French guy, Frederick?". I was totally shocked. How did he know? I questioned him about this. But he kept insisting he was referring to somebody else that I don't know. But then why did he ask me if I remember Frederick? I asked who is this Frederick he was talking about. He said he must have heard it on tv??? I got the feeling he didn't actually know who or what he was talking about... Interestingly on a separate occasion about a day or two later, another person and myself were working on a project together. They had created an account on a particular website. They then shared the password with me so I could also have access. I was surprised when they gave me the password, and the first 4 letters of the password, were the first 4 letters of "Frederick's" name. I asked, did you have a particular name in mind when you created this password, and they insisted they didn't. I was amused by the fact that two separate people for some reason had hinted at the same person.  #8203; There are many other examples and occurrences of what I've experienced. I'm not sure I've chosen good ones to give here. But the fact that people just seem to know things I never told them, even if they can't explain why, is rather disconcerting.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>My suggestion is to create a new throwaway Facebook account. Do not add any of your friends/family, just leave it blank. Then, link the Instagram account to the new Facebook. That way it won't suggest friends from your main Facebook and vice versa. Also, switch devices, as another commenter said. Also do not link your phone number to the account. And use an entirely new email address. Good luck.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>In my personal experience, it may not be that you did anything wrong. Something could be going on in her life that is taking her attention away from you. It could also be that, perhaps she simply was not ready to pursue a relationship, and she is afraid to face you directly and tell you. Which sucks, since she is aware that you were interested. I really understand how this treatment hurts and how it can occupy your mind as result. But really just try to make peace with it especially if you know you didn't do anything wrong to upset her on your end. Try and focus on other things. Immerse yourself in work or hobbies. I strongly wouldn't recommend trying to quickly find someone to replace her if she meant a lot to you. Just reassure yourself that you are not at fault, and allow yourself to heal.</TEXT>

    <TITLE>What exactly do people aim to achieve by "Negging"?</TITLE>
    <DATE>2020-08-01 17:29:16</DATE>
    <TEXT>I recently came across the term Negging for the first time. I had been experiencing this with a guy, but I was not aware that it was an actual thing, like a tactic that people do. This guy had gone out of his way to pursue me for a long time. I had been politely rejecting him previously because I simply wasn't ready for dating or getting into a relationship etc. I eventually agreed to go out with him about 10 months down the line. But the guy wound up being a complete jerk when we went out. He kept telling me about how he actually prefers taller girls (I'm 5'1). He said he hates when girls do their hair like I do mine. He said I'm a little too light skinned for him, he doesn't usually go for my complexion etc etc... Was all of this really supposed to get me to like him somehow? I was confused about why he asked me out if he thinks all of this about me. If anything I was put off by him. What is the point of negging exactly?</TEXT>

I'm not necessarily over here wanting to be more memorable to the people in question (friends, love interests etc), as I feel I do enough to show my interest in their lives. It's more a matter of, how do I stop caring so damn much about them? I don't know if I'm articulating the predicament correctly.

    <DATE>2020-08-11 18:04:19</DATE>
    <TEXT>Long story short, I was informed that what I am experiencing is a spiritual awakening of sorts. I began to experience really crazy synchronicities. And at times, it's as if the universe is communicating with me in different ways. But this has been a very emotionally draining experience. Very difficult, and I'm not entirely sure where the journey leads to. My main issue is that it feels like my emotions and mind are being toyed with by some unseen force. When I begin to feel good about this journey, something pulls me down again. Is the normal? Is this how an awakening is meant to go? I did not ask for this by any means and I really want my life to just return to normal. Please help.</TEXT>

I also think that if (especially in a forum/comment setting) you are respectful of others, then honestly you have nothing to fear or be concerned about when expressing your view. I think you need to learn to not care so much about what other people think. Especially online when you'll most probably never meet the people you're talking to.

    <TITLE>Is it generally perceived negatively if you're not smiling in photos?</TITLE>
    <DATE>2020-08-16 08:10:59</DATE>
    <TEXT>So I downloaded one of the dating apps for the first time. I got my first number of matches. And I'm just a little curious about what one of them said during our conversation. Overall, we spoke well with each other. But when I initiated the conversation he was literally like "wow, you look so serious". That was his opening message. He pointed out that I wasn't smiling in any of the photographs. None of these were group shots with friends and such. Just photos of me taken by my friend who is a professional photographer. But I'm questioning now whether it is really significant to smile in pictures in a dating app? Do people judge based on this? I feel like it's something I don't even consider about men when I swipe through profiles. Wouldn't the overall attractiveness and bio be your deciding factors on whether you say yes or no? I'm a noob so I'm working all of this out. Also, I just want to add. Based on discussions I've had, it would appear that smiling in pictures is more of a requirement for women than men for some reason. If a girl isn't smiling it is assumed she must be a bitch, whereas men can just get away with being neutral in photographs if he is attractive enough. Am I wrong? Thoughts?</TEXT>

    <TITLE>Is it unreasonable for me to be upset over my lecturer cursing me out?</TITLE>
    <DATE>2020-08-17 11:14:54</DATE>
    <TEXT>This happened a few months back, pre-covid. Basically I had submitted an assignment for university on time. We had to do both a digital and a physical submission. A little over a week later, my lecturer requested me to meet with her briefly. She basically told me there was some confusion over my assignment. Did I submit it or not? As she couldn't find it. I told her that I did a complete submission on the correct day and time. For me the situation wasn't that serious in that, it did not require such high anger and emotions. But my lecturer was extremely angry for some reason. She was in a state. She yelled at me in front of people, and told me that I'm lying. She proceeded to swear at me. She was being really disrespectful and rude, and it was especially uncalled for as we are both adults. The whole situation was really humiliating. The following day I was informed that my work had been found. My lecturer had made the mistake, and she did not bother to apologize. I was really angry. Even now I think about the situation and it makes me upset. The fact that she swore at me was really out of line. I feel like the institution would have protected her if I had reported it. The reason why this bothers me so much is because I find that people generally seem to think that it is okay to speak to me however they please, whereas they don't do this to other people. I experience disrespect from people often, and I don't know what it is about me. I am very quiet natured overall, so I don't know if that makes me a target. How can I move on from this situation, and going forward, what can I do when things like this occur?</TEXT>

But that certainly doesn't mean she should be allowed to get away with this behavior. Thank you, helped.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Thank you for your response. I really do see the value of being kind to others, as I know it can have karmic consequences. Doing good will attract good and vice versa. I'm not trying victimize my self. But being an introvert means that I'm rarely, if ever, mean or confrontational towards others. As a matter of fact, in situations where I should defend myself, or where I'd be justified by reciprocating in a mean way, I don't. Which is another problem altogether. I'm specifically wondering whether simply being in a negative headspace in and of itself, as a result of life circumstances, can be the cause of the negativity one experiences. But nevertheless, thanks for the response. Being positive towards others can only yield more positivity.</TEXT>

It's just hard because I've dealt with really vicious and abrasive people and it is always really unfounded. But the frequency of such encounters feels rather unnatural, which is why I'm asking this question. I suppose the best I can do is to try and lift myself out of my current mindset, despite the whole break up situation. Accept it is done and move on. Also, as the other commenter said, focus on projecting more positivity and kindness onto others, and hopefully kinder people will find their way to me.</TEXT>

    <TITLE>I often come across people who seem to deeply dislike me</TITLE>
    <DATE>2020-10-19 10:34:05</DATE>
    <TEXT>It's not all people, and so I suppose in the grand scheme of things, this shouldn't bother me. But it bothers me nevertheless. Mainly because I often can't seem to place what the person's problem is. Like I would understand if we had some kind of argument or squabble about something in the past, hence we are now not on good terms. In some cases the dislike for me really seems inexplicable. I am an introvert. I am generally a very quiet natured, and I tend to avoid conflict and confrontation. But it's almost like this very trait of mine is what causes problems for reasons I can't seem to understand. Some examples. When I got my first job recently, it is a corporate job at a large company. However the specific department I was hired at is new and small, and there are only 3 other people working there at the time. Two of the people were very kind and talkative with me, but the one woman doesn't even greet back whenever I say hello. I later heard she'd been talking about me around the office in the other departments, and there was one occasion where I could clearly hear her talking about me on the phone in the other room, which I felt was deliberate. I also have an aunt who just doesn't like me for whatever reason. She's very fond of my older brother, and interacts really well with all my cousins. But she just doesn't talk to me when I'm around and when she does she always seems to have an attitude. I experienced the same thing when I was at university where there was a group of girls who just didn't like me. I also had a lecturer curse me out because *she* had misplaced my work and thought that I had caused the confusion. There are several other situations like this. I don't know what the problem with me is. And I don't mean that in a way in which I am trying to victimise myself. I mean I've genuinely done some introspection, and I don't know what it is that attracts behaviour like this towards myself. Does being quiet natured just naturally encourage extroverted people to behave this way? What can I do to deal with this issue?</TEXT>

I am a little bit of a sceptic, but I thought I'd go along with it anyway, because what harm could it do right? So we go to the psychic man, and we discussed a lot of things. My aunt had to accompany me because there was a language barrier between myself and the guy, so she had to translate. A lot of very personal things came up during the session. Because of this, I had thought that my aunt would understand and that she would keep everything between only the two of us. A couple of days later, my cousins were all asking about stuff the psychic dude had said and if it was the truth. My aunt had basically told them everything. I was a little annoyed by this and I expressed to my one cousin that I wish my aunt had kept it quiet. My cousin then told my aunt what I said, after I had left. Now my aunt is like soooo furious. She's is really mad that I said she shouldn't have told everyone. For me this is like a really stupid thing to get upset over, but she is really angry because she says she went out of her way to help me, and this is my response to situation. She's not talking to me now. Am I wrong for feeling like certain things were personal and that I did not want to share with my whole family? I thought she would understand this. How do I rectify the situation with her? TL;DR : My aunt told my whole family personal things about me that I expected to keep private.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Absolutely, I know that now. But I didn't have the foresight prior to this. I turned to her because I saw her as a mother figure, and I thought she would be understanding. I didn't know she'd just run around and spread the story. Really disappointing.</TEXT>
