    <TEXT>My 5k pr is 16:08 and I rarely go faster than 8:15 pace on recovery days. Go as slow as you need, even if that means 10:00+. 4/5 miles should be a good length.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Obviously everyone is different and recovers as difficult paces. I only included a 5k time to put my recovery pace into perspective, hence why I said not to be afraid of going very slow. I don #8217;t think it #8217;s as complicated as you #8217;re making it. Just run as slow as your body needs and don #8217;t overthink. It #8217;s just running.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I would break non-native trout into two categories: non-native but wild and stocked. I agree that stocked trout are much less favorable than native trout and it #8217;s a shame that they outcompete them and take up resources that could go to protection the native fish Here #8217;s where I disagree. I think non-native wild trout should be protected and cared for just as mush as the natives. For example, brook trout are an invasive species to the Rocky Mountains but they are beautiful fish and coexist with the native cutthroats. As long as the fish are growing and reproducing naturally in the wild I think it #8217;s great that we have them. Where I #8217;m from we have basically no native trout so maybe that #8217;s why I feel that way haha</TEXT>

    <TEXT>So LitMobile just sent me this solar wireless battery pack. I'm excited, let's see what's inside! I really like the build. It's got hand grips on the side, it's shock proof, and water resistant. The power bank has 20,000 milliamps, which can fully charge your phone up to 8 times. It's also got a convenient loop for carabiners. On the back of the device we have a bunch of solar panels which can charge the battery bank in about 60 minutes. On the top of the device there are 3 USB ports and 2 of them are fast chargers. Hit the power button two times- the LED lights will come on. If you hit the power button once, the LED lights will tell you how much battery you have. There's a micro-USB port on the side for fast charging. My favorite part of this device is that it charges my phone... wirelessly. There's a red light indicator at the top to let you know that your phone is charging.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>For general fitness, a healthy male runs between 7:30-8:00 and a female would be around 8:00-8:30. Someone who #8217;s more athletic may run closer to 5:45-6:30, and elite runners run under 4 minutes. If you #8217;re getting into running for general fitness or to loose weight, try running 3-4 miles a day, 3 times a week, for 10ish mpw (miles per week). Once you #8217;re used to running you can start running 4 times a week and keep slowly building up to 15 or 20 mpw.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>There is no federal law, it varies per state. One example is Texas. McFadden vs. State (2018) - allowing use of deadly force when there's no other way to protect or recapture property even in situations involving simple theft or criminal mischief. Besides, nobody in this video used deadly force anyways. And considering that the angry mob was already trespassing on private property, the homeowners lives would have been in enough immediate danger that deadly force would have been justified had the anyone charged them. I guarantee you that they will not be prosecuted.</TEXT>

[PrOpeR CiTaTioN](https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=3161145627178569736) If an angry mob with weapons trespasses through a gated community, and proceeds to charge at the homeowners on their lawn, the shooting would 100% be justified in every court in America.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Carp are my favorite species to catch on the fly. Small orangish foam flies are really simple and are a great bread imitation. Typical egg patents that you might use for trout can work well, just really big ones (a yellow egg can imitate corn quite well). I #8217;ve also had luck with a little white cotton puff ball. Carp fishing rivers is a completely different game than fishing a pond. If you do a Google Search for  #8216;carp flies #8217; mostly all of them will be meant for fishing big rivers where the carp eat minnows, crayfish and more natural foods. For a pond, anything slow-sinking that imitates bread, corn, worms, or something else they might eat should work well. Just cast the fly ahead of them and let it slowly sink to line up with the direction that they #8217;re headed. Hot and sunny days with little wind are usually best. Make sure you have at least a 5/6 wt rod and you #8217;ll probably want 3x. Be ready for a long battle once you #8217;re hooked up. Good luck!!!!</TEXT>

Hell, some people are so dependent that they can #8217;t sleep without smoking before bed. Most people who say it #8217;s for stress or anxiety are hooked and use that as justification.

    <TEXT>The water is very clear. You want light tippet, 3x should be good. For flies, you can catch them on top, but I #8217;ve had the best luck on clouser minnows. Any streamer should be good, especially ones that imitate crawfish and shad. Typically during the day light colors work better. Don #8217;t go oversized on the flies, a finesse presentation is better. Bring polarized glasses and you should be able to sight cast to fish. I usually fish a 6wt but an 8wt is also good. In most cases you won #8217;t want sinking line, just a sink tip. Good luck and feel free to pm any other questions!!</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Be careful, being fixated on your weight can be a dangerous mindset to have. You should not focus on loosing weight, especially since your weight is already normal and healthy. Anyways, feeling out of shape and sluggish is almost guaranteed after taking an extended break from running. I would recommend keeping a journal where you write down how far you ran, the pace, how you felt, and if you saw any cool dogs or anything else. That #8217;s a good way to monitor progress and it #8217;ll keep you motivated. You #8217;ll be surprised how quickly you #8217;ll regain fitness. Good luck and make sure to have fun.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Inner cities, including Roxbury have much higher infant mortality rates, higher crime, and higher opioid usage.

That doesn #8217;t mean that the average Roxbury resident is dying at or before 59 years old. That is ridiculous. If you live to 60 years old you aren #8217;t a minority.
