    <TEXT>she literally got up and left, with absolutely no invitation given to follow her. she probably showed she was uncomfortable in other ways. laughing could #8217;ve been one, or bunching up in on herself or freezing up. when a man isn #8217;t bothering to get consent to start, saying  #8220;no #8221; or  #8220;stop #8221; can be really, REALLY scary. it #8217;s the same reason most women just don #8217;t respond at all to catcalls: angering an already aggressive man could potentially mean getting murdered. it #8217;s a scary world out there</TEXT>

    <TEXT>the predatory lesbian thing is a really harmful stereotype mostly perpetuated by straight women but also yeah, gay ladies don #8217;t really get any sex ed at all, and women can be responsible for rape. it #8217;s just not all that common. most lesbians have very happy and consensual sex lives.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>has my mental health gone to absolute shit? one thousand percent. do I want everyone in my life to think i #8217;m doing amazingly all the time? one THOUSAND percent. but I think I might #8217;ve let something slip. I was in english, we #8217;re studying the play *Death of a Salesman* and, spoiler alert, the main character, Willy, is a salesman and he dies. he commits suicide. big surprise yada yada so in our groups my teacher had us answer questions and one of them was about the ethics of suicide and bullshit like that. and these two girls at my table started going off about how  #8220;selfish #8221; it is to commit suicide, or attempt, or to even BE SUICIDAL to begin with, and I was kind of just seething, because I have a lot of my own feelings about that which I won #8217;t go into or this post is gonna turn into a 6 page essay. anyway so I was like,  #8220;I kinda disagree. #8221; and they both turned and looked at me like I was the fucking devil and they basically said  #8220;well it is. #8221;  #8220;Well, you have to understand that the mindset of someone who is suicidal is leading them to believe #8212; #8220; and they basically asked what mindset, specifically, and i told them that in order to be willing to fucking kill yourself, it #8217;s usually not a decision seen as a  #8220;way out #8221; like people say and rather made from the belief that this world is better off without you. and then one of them scoffed and said  #8220;What are you, suicidal or something? #8221; and I didn #8217;t really know what to say? I kinda of just laughed and said  #8220;no, but I have friends and family that are. #8221; which is true, so, not a total lie. and then they were like  #8220;well how would you know then? #8221; and basically turned their backs to me and went on with whatever they wanted to talk about. which, like, whatever, right? well, apparently it #8217;s not over. the local school Martyr #8482; #65039; happened to come up to me the other day like  #8220;how are you doing sweaty? #8221; which was my first clue something was up. some of the more popular kids have just kind of been ignoring me altogether. and then the mental health clique, the kids who have depression and it shows and they #8217;re supportive and there for each other, came up to me #8212; not to offer support, but to be mad at me, in fact. they said that they heard about the class, and that I could never really understand what the experience is like. they said that I should stay out of it, and that while they appreciate the defense, they  #8220;don #8217;t need my pity. #8221; so, I have no fucking clue what is being spread about me. is it the whole story? are these girls just going around calling me suicidal? whose to fucking say????? I don #8217;t want to ask around, I don #8217;t want to acknowledge it at all, and i #8217;m hoping it #8217;ll all just go away. but honestly at this point I didn #8217;t think shit could get worse, and it doesn #8217;t help that school was kind of my only escape. even though i #8217;m faking being fine, being in a place where people just treat you like a normal and capable human being is a nice feeling, even if it #8217;s hard to keep up the act. and now that #8217;s basically gone, so I guess I kind of have absolutely nowhere to feel human. fun!!!!!! anyway, shits been bad. this has been a rant by me. much love to everyone and even though it seems like everything #8217;s gone to the shitter and there #8217;s no fucking way out and i #8217;m totally fucking spiraling and have been for 2 weeks and it just keeps getting worse, at least I know I haven #8217;t hit rock bottom yet, and once I get there, the only options are i #8217;ll either kill myself or start finding my way up! so, I guess shits fine. kinda.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>some people can just be so open. it #8217;s exhausting just watching them. I had a friend, and when she was feeling down, she could just stand there and cry and expect the world to stop and take care of her. and it did, people would always comfort here and hug her and make her feel better. she wouldn #8217;t even try to stop crying, she #8217;d just keep going. I guess I was always a little bit jealous, because I knew if I ever cried like that no one would be there for me. I guess to me crying has always been about weakness, and opening up looks pathetic. people who can just stand and cry and not even try to stop seem so alien to me, I don #8217;t even know how to process what they must feel when they do it. idk man. best of luck to you</TEXT>

    <TEXT>and then when you do try and participate it gets criticized as  #8220;performative activism. #8221; don #8217;t let it get you down. if you #8217;re able, just donate what you can, you don #8217;t have to make a big show of it to  #8220;prove yourself. #8221; it #8217;s fine if you just stay off social media during this time, only take on what you can handle  lt;3</TEXT>

    <TEXT>it #8217;s my cake day. when I made this account i didn #8217;t expect to see it through more than three months. now it #8217;s been a whole year. i keep planning to kill myself and either failing, or not finding it in me to go through with it. I was gonna kill myself on may 31st. it #8217;s now a whole month later. none of it feels real. now I don #8217;t think I can kill myself, there are some obligations that I have now and responsibilities that have been given to me (not my choice, but I need to see them through). I don #8217;t think i #8217;ll be able to get out of them for at least another year. likely longer than that. so, I guess i #8217;ll see you guys next year, too, possibly. weird shit.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I feel that. people don #8217;t understand that high functioning depression is a thing. I can force myself to do anything if I feel like I don #8217;t have a choice, but there #8217;s no happiness or passion there. the only  #8220;reason #8221; I feel the need to do anything is because I don #8217;t want to make somebody else disappointed or mad at me. ultimately, it #8217;s just going through the motions.</TEXT>
