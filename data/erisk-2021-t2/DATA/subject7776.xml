    <TEXT>i have played for about five years and I think im good at it. I would suggest you started making up your own stuff and find your own sound when improvising. it may be discouraging from the start when you are not happy how you sound, but you will get better. i think if you rely too much on scales to tell you what to play, i think you will get very restricted and disappointed. a scale is an explanation of a group of sequence of notes, nothing else. i think training your ear is the best way to develope as a musician.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>The exact same thing happened to me. I went to audition for one of the most esteemed schools you could find in Stockholm, not knowing what kind of school it was. I didnt know anything about theory, I was a gary moore fan, but i got accepted because of my rather good aural skills. But the school was a jazz school. I decided to switch school after one term, maybe not because of the schools genre but because i didnt like my classmates that much. I think that every serious guitar player should learn jazz scales and modes because it expands your vocabulary, so i would advice you to see this as an opprtunity to better yourself as a musician! Learn as much as tou can about what you dont know! I hope that makes sense</TEXT>

Use every note to its fullest and you can learn how to express a ridicoulous amount of emotion in a single note. *It sounds clich #233;, I know* **Guthrie Govan** He is my idol right now. He can play absolutely anything he want, he is completely free in his playing.

    <TEXT>Im gonna break the circlejerk over marijuana here and say that weed and cigarettes are very different. Yes, cigarettes are more physically harmful than marijuana, but marijuana does make you noticeably more intoxicated than cigarettes. Now, reddit seems to be under some of "legalizing everything" and "the government should get the fuck out of my personal drug addiction/use" concensus, which leads me to a revelating conclusion - reddit is fundamentally libertarian. Maybe not as much of a revelation to some as it was to me, but i think this reflects well onto how young americans think. Its a kind of a-la-carte mishmash of opinions. Government should get out of my house, but criminalize guns. Legalize drugs, but implement universal health care. I find it confusing</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I often get annoyed with RIcky and Steve trying to extract as much ridicule as possible from Karls theories and comments. The one about the doppelganger is a sound comment. If i had an EXACT replica of myself, then I and my doppelganger would think the same things and both would think he was the real one. But i also think i like when he complains and whinges about stuff. Like what kind of questions he is getting or what kind of scenario Ricky paints for him that is ridiculess. But there is something abstract about him that I cannot for the life of me put my finger on.</TEXT>

Yes, the New Testament is filled with love, Jesus spoke of such lovely things, like for instance the dozen verses where he threatens with hellfire. And the lovely concept that every man is born in sin, and ordered to be well. Just that little one. Seriously, watered-down Christianity infuriates me with this self-rightousness. "Just love, man. Jesus said that." Yes he did, but read your own bible. Jesus is either the son of God or a madman. An evil madman.</TEXT>

    <TITLE>What happened between Hamada and Matsumoto?</TITLE>
    <DATE>2014-03-06 23:42:34</DATE>
    <TEXT>Im sure this question has been asked and answered before, but i couldn't find any. So, as we all now, Downtown does not hang out socially, Matsumoto did not have Hamadas phone number until he was asked to get it by Yoshimoto. He wasn't sure he had seen Hamadas kids either, which is really strange in my opinion. So they obviously get along while on the show as Downtown but their relationship outside TV is everything but relaxed. I also know that Matsumoto shaved his head as to announce a new beginning for the duo and I think i read somewhere that it was around that time that they started to grow apart. Does anyone have any details as to why this happen? Did Downtown just fall on bad times or was there anything more concrete that caused their relationship to crumble?</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Yes, nicely put. I have also seen the documentary. What I thought at the end of it is that they have the exact opposite personalities of what you expect them to have. on camera, matsumoto is the playful, positive and social type guy and Hamada tends to be more demeaning and passive-aggressive. You really notice how much of a role they both play on camera. Matsumoto seems almost introverted and anti-social off-camera and Hamada is the opposite. But opposites attract, as they say. Do you think that they have just grown tired of eachother after years and years of meetings and tv recordings? They feel so comfortable with eachother that they do not care about maintaining the relationship off-camera?</TEXT>

    <TITLE>Weak fretting hand...</TITLE>
    <DATE>2014-03-16 21:36:27</DATE>
    <TEXT>Ive been playing the electric guitar for about 5 years now and I've come to a saddening conclusion: my fretting hand is very weak. I can play guitar very easily except for when it comes to bends and vibrato bends. As my main influence is Gary Moore who is famous for his fantastic bends and strong vibrato, this depresses me. I've watched countless instructional videos where people say things like "just practice and you'll get stronger". I have practiced vibrato bends for countless hours but it never seems to come naturally, I always have to struggle to get it to sound good. I play with 0.09's because of this and I do have my thumb gripping the neck so I cannot for the life of me understand what Im doing wrong. Do any of you have any tips? Any exercises to purely develop muscle strength in the hand/wrist? This is really holding me back in my playing.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Yes, exactly my point. I've found that when I slow stuff down to the point of no recognition, I have a hard time to remember the context and style of the piece or lick that im practicing. I've heard Shawn Lane had the same approach I had. He slowed stuff down and practiced it so he had all the notes in his head, then he would play it at 70% and then he would just go for it, head on rambo-style. It would of course not sound very good at that moment, but that kept the spirit and style of the lick intact. He would then of course clean it up. oh and thanks for the tip! Do you guys think about the speed of bend vibratos to the point of measuring it in 16th and so forth? I have never heard of this approach but it sounds like you would be in great control of the technique if you do that!</TEXT>

    <TITLE>Training tool for left hand bend strength?</TITLE>
    <DATE>2014-03-24 15:21:19</DATE>
    <TEXT>I posted a while back asking for tips how to improve my bend technique and left hand strength and I must say that I got very good constructive responses from you guys, so I'm coming back with an update! I went to my local guitar shop asking for the GripMaster thingie. The guitar tech there basically said that it was not good to train with those things because its a very static excercise and you run the risk of inflicting injury with it. Plus, if its bends you want to get stronger at, a tool that focuses on contracting (? closing your fist) is not what you do when you bend. You extend your fist outwards, not inwards. He told me about another kind of training tool, some kind of ball. You put your fingers through some kind of slot and you can extend and retract, so you got a much less of a static motion going on. I think this sounds good, do you guys have any thoughts on this? Also, do you know the name or type of tool he is talking about? I can't remember the company name, but I think it was either EBS, GHS or Ernie Ball that produced it. PS. Before people say the usual "just practice your guitar", let me clear the air. I am overly-flexibel in my fingers and throughout different parts of my body. So I have never had to use as much strength in my fingers for, lets say, catching a baseball. When normal people do it, they use the finger muscles to stop the balls motion whereas I just let the ball move my fingers to the point when my finger joints just stops the motion. So I run the risk of injuring myself if I just start to mercelessly bend day in day out, I need a gradual strength build up. Sorry for the wall of text!</TEXT>

I'll see if that's enough. But also, it would seem to me like learning how to bend is pretty natural to most people, and without difficulty.

    <TEXT>No thanks alot! That's what I've been doing as of today. Just do a full bend then wobbling it down a full step until I feel my wrist and forearm seize up a bit. **I figured out where I've gone wrong all these years.** Instead of resting the lowest part of your index finger on the far side of the neck with your thumb up around the nearest side of the neck and then turning your wrist like a doorknob (thus working the weight of the string with your strong wrist and forearm), I have, when bending, had my thumb on the right place but my palm inched away a bit from the neck so that the only part touching the guitar was the thumb and the fingers fretting the note. Not any part of the palm really. Damn, it sucks learning these things so far into the playing process (5 years), y'know starting over again. But I guess its better than never. Maybe knowing this now, sometime in the future, I'll sing with my guitar like dear old Gary Moore. Well, one can dream.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Hi guys. I've just watched a documentary about two identical twins going on two diets; one on a high fat, low carb diet and the other on the opposite with sugar and carbs. The doctor there said that reducing carbs can be dangerous as you mostly lose muscle mass when you lose weight and not as much as one hopes in the fat. This was appareantly dangerous. I've been on a GI-diet for about two months and have lost about 15 lbs, but I'm now worried! Can someone please explain if I'm justified in my worry or not? PS. I have been eating fruits and have had cheat days maybe once or twice every two weeks, so I'm not on a LCHF diet exactly, it's a bit more lenient.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Hi! My long finger on my left hand is hurting just below the top of the nail. I think that I might have torn the skin from the nail on a little spot. This will of course heal rather quickly, but does this happen to you too? I have been training my bends quite much lately, I guess that is why it happens.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Im a great admirer of this subreddit but I sometimes feel too young for it. These guitarists named here are good, but I always have to take in the fact that they were good *for their time*. Is that wrong? If I have to name underrated guitarists I would name Andy Timmons, Eric Gales, Derek Trucks and someone like George Marios but these are all solo guitarists. Maybe I'm too niched!</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Hi guys, I'm new here to the subreddit so I thought i would plead some help from you all. I've finished watching all the available episodes of AoT and I must say, I was absolutely stunned. So incredibly beautifully animated with intruiging characters with a plot that keeps you hooked. Who could ask for more? Well, I CAN! What the hell am I supposed to watch now?! I've watched some Naruto, thought it to be silly (as it's supposed to be), watch SAO and i kinda like that one, but you simply cannot compare it to the magnitude and sheer awesomeness that is AoT. I've watched some Cowboy Bepop, but that seemed to begin almost anew every episode. So, if you guys are interested in helping a new but thirsty anime-fan with some tips on an epic anime series with intruiging characters WITH ,most importantly, a plot that continues, that would be simply great of you! PS. These are all just my opinions on the other animes, and we are all entitled to them . :)</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Thanks for all the tips so far, what are your opinion on Kuerimoa? And just to add something I've noted about AoT, its no overly sexualized at all! I kind of like that. When you've got a serious and epic plot going on and then, all of a sudden, a pair of gigantic boobanies flop out in the middle of the screen, it tends to cheapen it a bit IMO, but I guess that is in some ways unavoidable when watching anime... right?</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Yeah, its not your normal problem with this thing as it only happens after I've played my xbox 360 with an ethernet cable and THEN connecting my mac to internet with the same cable. So everytime I've played some multiplayer games via ethernet on the Xbox, I pull the cable out of the Xbox and into the socket in my mac, then I get the "self-assigned ip adress" conundrum on my mac which is, as you probable can figure out, infuriating. I've tried some solutions but this particuar issue seems very rare as I can find zero threads about it. My specs are macbook pro 2009. Router is a normal damn router, a Netgear something. Ps. I can't get another Ethernet cable to both the mac and the xbox as I only have on socket in my room.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>No, nothing works. I found out that my Xbox before restarting has an Ip adress that is outside that sort of range that my router allow. Say that my router allows 177.177.0.1-177.177.0.19, my xbox had an ip way out of that range. Now, when I restarted the router, my xbox actually snatched an ip adress that was occupied by another unit on my Wifi, and that unit snatched someone elses ip adress and so forth, but this made it work. Can I reprogram my router to allow the initial adress my Xbox had before restarting my browser or should I reprogram my xbox to have an Ip adress inside the allowed scope of Ip adresses?</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Yes, and vice versa too. Like if i have played the night before on my xbox and plug the ethernet into the mac the next morning then it will say the old "self-assigned ip adress" and will give me this error ip adress. Its working right now, the ethernet connection suddenly decided that it was going to play ball with me and gave me a valid ip adress. These sorts of sporadic malfunctions are unbearable... I'll guess there is something wrong with my router as is keeps giving me invalid ip adresses? Like, buy a new one?</TEXT>

    <TITLE>[TOMT](Movie) Old funny fantasy movie about vikings!</TITLE>
    <DATE>2015-01-07 00:43:42</DATE>
    <TEXT>So, I watched this movie a loooong time ago. From what I can remember, it looked like it was from either 80's or maybe even 70's. It was kind of a fantasy movie (like he-man maybe?) but it was about vikings and they were going to Valhalla. The fellowship was at one point in the movie visiting a town that would later be sunk (atlantis?) and the mayor or whatever of that town was insisting that they weren't as he was standing on the last piece of stone that was sinking into the ocean. I guess it was funny as well, kind of a humourus self-aware fantasy thing. If anyone can help, that would be great!</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Just got this. RES wont allow me to quick view any pictures or videos and all my preferred subreddits at the top has been swapped out for all my subreddits. What's going on? I have removed RES and installed it again and the same problem comes up. 4.5.4 Firefox Can add that I get this problem message: Sorry, but localStorage seems inaccessible. Reddit Enhancement Suite can't work without it. Since it looks like you're using Firefox, you probably need to go to about:config and ensure that dom.storage.enabled is set to true, and that dom.storage.default_quota is set to a number above zero (i.e. 5120, the normal default)". I checked all those things and the setting are as they should be.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I love the fact that we are all subscribed to this subreddit but have roughly come to the same conclusion that we dont particularily like Ricky anymore... Couldn't agree more though, did y'all see the interview he did for the Golden Globes where the interviewer asked Ricky about why he hasn't fixed his teeth yet, where he responds that "when you are as rich as I am, you get your butlers to chew the food for you"?

    <TITLE>Some thoughts about the "No-Laughing" series...</TITLE>
    <DATE>2015-01-28 20:49:14</DATE>
    <TEXT>I honestly think that these no-laughing series are getting poorer and poorer. They are predictable, they feel so forced and it seems like the Gaki crew are getting more and more desensitized to the crazy sketches and pranks the staff plans for them. Maybe it's because they are getting older, but it's so very different from the first couple in the series. The funniest parts in my view are when the crew are just lounging around, like Matsumoto telling stories about Hamada and the bamkauchen (?), or when Tanaka misspeaks or Hosei has to put on that silly red costume, or when Hamada tickles Matsumoto or Hamada staring at Tanaka to make him laugh. Those were fucking hilarious! They were so revealing of their characters and their relationship towards eachother, but nowadays it seems like they just sit around waiting for the next prank or sketch to take place so they can laugh. And the introduction of these TV-type contests with the conveyer belt seem just so forced, like the crew has to keep maxing and maxing everything instead of coming up with new creative things to have the gaki crew react to. Anyone feeling the same?</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Well I wouldn't say that those two examples are the same as it feels like the TV-style competitions these last no-laughing games has had feels a lot more produced and self-concious. The Gaki crew knows immediatly whats going on (as they also pointed out this year as they were entering the set) as the hotel one felt alot more fresh and sudden for our respected members. I do totally agree with your summary though. I don't know how I can expect to be surprised every year by these series, they have done similiar things for 25 years now. But just to clarify what I am looking for, I mean segments like the sadistic doctor slapping around patients that can't move, or the Heipo apology letter have both been done before but I liked them alot and they were fresh to me then, but segments like that would be appreciated by me anyways. To conclude, these are just my opinions and I would expect there are 5 million japanese that would beg to differ as I'm not their target demographic, but it does seem like they are milking it a bit now, thats all.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I can agree to almost all of that. The reason I even replied to your comment in the first place is that people who would advocate privat health insurance often make arguments like you did, "it takes too long, bad quality of doctors" etc etc. Can we both agree that the root of the problem is that not enough money is funneled into the swedish health care system and the solution is NOT privatized health care and I would be happy.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I totally agree with you, but there is however a trend right now on subreddits like /r/atheism and /r/The_Donald to differentiate christian homophobia and muslim homophobia. I do not really see the point of doing this because they are both symptoms of a greater problem, ignorance and prejudice. Why do people want to highlight the fact that the Orlando shooter was a muslim homophobic fanatic when I think that in fact serves as a covershield for other CHRISTIAN homophobes to wipe themselves free from the same kind of hate they themselves hold? I think to criticize ignorance wherever it is is needed but if you really want to solve the problem, I think that a deeper digging into the harm of religiosity in general would serve us much, much better in the long run.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Watch ur replays. If u think its the teams fault then you will never EVER get better. This mentality is what is keeping people from improving and raising their mmr. One tip is to learn one hero through and through. I raised my mmr from 2.1k to 3.6k by spamming windrunner mid. Even tho the hero is flawed and not in the meta, if i outplay my opponent mid and get a fast blink/aghs/maelstrom, I can solokill people without getting punished because people arent really that good at punishing overextensions in that bracket. Other heroes to learn are Slark, Pa, OD, Timbersaw. Other than that, be selfcritical.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>what is wrong with LP? People behaving badly in a game majorly dependant on teamplay is something to be thoroughly discouraged. If someone who repeatadly flames in their games would only get muted, then the flamers teams is at a severe disadvantage by not being able to communicate with all team members, and therefore more negativity is created. More harsh measures needs to be applied to toxic players, as it is now. If someone has a good day and wins some games, that would maybe make them more prone to abandoning games if they only lost some mmr, bringing another stupid factor into the game. A 24 hour search ban for someone intentionally feeding is very lenient, as this act is probably the one most infuriating for everyone involved. Lets say you are having a bad game, you know that you wont be able to play another game for 24 hours anyways because of whatever, maybe you are going away for a day, so you feed the game, all the while knowing that the punishment won't affect you in any way whatsoever. Why Low Priority would encourage people to lash out at another is only a factor if you are already in low priority. I'm sure there are moments where players has gotten into LP unfairly, but im also sure that if you keep getting put into low priority then there is something wrong with your playstyle or interaction with your team. We all have bad games, I have bad games too but I wouldn't resort to personal flaming. Maybe critiqueing someones item build or hero pick is warranted, but that never gets me into LP, and I'm sure mild flaming isn't whats getting you into LP either. I think alot of it is about balancing out your ups and downs. When you are angry/salty, dont go to deep. But if you are 100% sure that the fault lies with Valve, then god help your soul. Also I'm 99% sure that players behaviour scores factor into the type of player you get matched with. So, if you have a low behaviour score, you get matched with other players with the same score as yourself (flamers gets matched with other flamers). If you keep your head down and even add some positivity here and there, your behaviour score will slowly rise and you will get more pleasant teammates. In the last 200+ games, I haven't had a feeder or a serious flamer on my team, which Im sure must be because I myself rarely do that, or Im just insanely INSANELY lucky Kappa</TEXT>

    <TEXT>It just sounds like your behaviour score is super-shitty. Type in that command in the console to see what value you have. Trying to blame Valve and other players for your situation seems like a great way of never changing anything and just hoping things change on it's own. How about you make a serious effort in the next 50+ games to raise your behaviour score rather than blaming a system that's probably not going to change anytime soon?</TEXT>

    <TEXT>All I could think about when watching Kiki's was how much the city looked like Stockholm. Even shop names and such was in swedish, and many of the buildings are actually real buildings here in Stockholm. So if you want to live in that world, take a trip to Stockholm and walk around Old Town (Gamla Stan) and you will feel right at home!</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Why does everyone think that you have to work many hours per TI cycle to get invited? You could do alot of events or casts and still be a worse pick in Valves eyes than someone else. By the way, has OP even considered the kind of role that kotlguy does in comparison to pyrion? Kotlguy is at his best when he is a host, flax does not host at all. These two does not compare in their own field. As a host, the slots are limited to two, even one host per Valve event before this. As an analyst/panelist whatever, there are much more slots available to you. That said, I liked kotlguy as a host for the draftpanel last TI and should have been invited if they are doing another draft panel, but I think day9, machine or Redeye is ahead of Kotlguy in terms of hosting, as Valve appearantly thinks too.</TEXT>

He is also a better analyst then kotlguy, who has never professed himself to be anything other than a host or a panelist. I agree with you, kotlguy is a super likeable fella. I think the other hosts available at this moment is a tier above him. But I would love to see him at Ti. This talk that "this guy deserves x more than this" is so stupid... You can't even compare slacks to pyrion, as slacks is a content creator outside of the couch/panel, pyrion doesnt do that. Im sure ccnc isnt there for his personality but for his knowledge about the game and the insight he gives into all the teams, which is something that kotlguy doesnt have. apples to oranges or something</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I think one of the main things that people around your bracket lacks is the aim to lead your team to victory. One thing that I did to climb from 2.7k to 4.2k is just to try to talk more over mic and NEVER EVER EVER say anything that could potentially tilt my teammates. Keep a positive attitude and see opportunities rather than bunker down and get negative. This does however mean that you yourself need to have a good game sense. You need to know if your lineup benefits from having the game go late or if you think that your team needs to take objectives early, even if its risky. If you want to push a tower or go high ground, try to communicate calmly and openly to your supports that they should grab some wards and smokes and invade around places where you want to push next. If your supports dont want to do that, then you could buy a smoke yourself. its only 50g (come on). Sometimes, I feel like holding your teammates hostage before a smoke could egg them to actually joining you in a smoke gank. If you just tell your support to buy a smoke and kill someone in their jungle, that might never happen because so many things needs to be done before the gank actually starts. But if you are the one that has a smoke, standing beside one or two of your teammates while pinging your smoke in your backpack, they are more likely to follow you. Its very important however to realize if you have made bad calls. If the second smoke gank that you have initiated fails, then you need to realize that your team has lost faith in your ability to lead them to victory, and u need to step back and take more of a backseat approach to the game. Little things like this will definitly put your team ahead of the other team, as proper shotcalling and kind-of efficient movement around the map is something that rarely happens in low 3k matches. People just farm and then someone pings rosh and someone gets an aegis and towers fall. If there is just one person in the game with a clear gameplan, that team will have a major benefit as the game plays out. People do not listen tho, in general at around 3k. But what happened to me was that if my first couple of shots called were successfull, then my team listened to me 100%. Its all up to you, how you want to win the game. If you are invested in the game and you are in it to win it without expressing frustration and/or negativity, you will have a clear advantage.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Hey my dudes! Looking for a Gaki episode where the regular crew minus Hamada went and grabbed miyasako and his partner to join them in a quiz that Hamada is the host for. The quiz/game is somewhat of a tempo game, like the one they did in last years batsu where they were asked to praise someone in time. This one is somewhat similar but Hamada gets super pissed, and Matsumoto is the co-host. All the other members gets very scared. Any clues? Tried searching for it on the list of "other subbed episodes " but didnt manage to find it.</TEXT>

However, when playing other games and i want to drag my mouse over on my second monitor to switch tabs or something, I usually ALT+TAB so my mouse can get on the second monitor. When doing this in Rocket League, it minimizes the game. Is there anyway to stop rocket league from minimizing when alt+tabbing so it just isnt in focus instead?</TEXT>

Now, the Dell only recognizes the monitor hooked up via DVI and not the HDMI one. If I try to boot up the computer with only the HDMI monitor plugged in, I get an error message before windows is started that I have plugged something into the internal something and that I need to plug it in correctly. Does anyone of you know is HDMI should be compatible or only DVI? I'll get personally deeply offended and sad if thats the case :(</TEXT>

    <TITLE>Question about Yamaha THR</TITLE>
    <DATE>2018-11-07 16:10:34</DATE>
    <TEXT>Hello! Im thinking of buying a Yamaha THR10 but im in need of some help. Im looking for something to function as an amp interface that I can connect to my PC via USB cable to use while im livestreaming and recording in for example Logic, to avoid having to mic up an amplifier. The interface would in this case substitute to the amp. Would a Yamaha THR10 work in this case? I already have a pedalboard that I use in front of the amp with the signal chain as following: guitar- gt;pedalboard- gt;amplifier (potentially THR10) - gt;computer (via USB cable). And another question. THere are loads of different YamahaTHR10 models, whats difference between them all? Like THR10c, THR10x, THR10 V2 and b-stock variant of the C and X model. Really confusing! Anyways thanks!</TEXT>

So therefore im just looking for a good sounding amp base sound on the clean channel that transfers that sound well into the pc. in this case it sounds like the thr base model is the choice for me, do you know if that one works well with distortion pedals? how about chorus and delay?</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Hello! Im as of lately getting more and more interested in getting a dog as im a huge animal lover and would love to get a dog friend. Im currently living in a quite small apartment, but the thing is that im not that big of a fan of smaller dogs. Is there a breed of dog thats medium to larger sized that could live in an apartment? Im a quite active person so i guess i could handle the exercise and activity part fairly well. Also, Im very sensitive to loud, sudden sounds and it would probably wear both me and my neighbours down if my dog was barking while indoors, can you train any dog breed to not bark indoors? Any help, tips or suggestions of breed and/or bark prevention training would be extremely helpful!</TEXT>

    <TITLE>Game doesnt start after Easy Anti-Cheat window</TITLE>
    <DATE>2019-03-03 22:28:38</DATE>
    <TEXT>I know people have posted threads like this before, but most of them where posted over a month ago and I have yet seen a solution to my problem. Here's the situation: Open Origin, launch Apex Legends after I've updated the game. A window from Easy Anti-Cheat pops up with a blue loading bar at the bottom. That bar progresses all the way to the right, and the window closes. After about five seconds im being taken back to the Origin client and nothing else happens. Solutions I've tried so far: * Uninstalling and reinstalling Easy Anti-Cheat through the setup file in programfiles/origingames/etcetc. * Killing any extra unnescessary process in task manager, because its known that third party RGB controls can be the source of this error. I didnt even have any to begin with, except Razor Synapse, which I also killed just to try. * Uninstalling both Origin and Apex Legends * Repairing the Anti-Cheat software through the setup file. * Allowing both Apex Legends and Easy Anti-cheat to pass through Windows Defender, as I have no other firewall at the moment. None of these solutions have worked. What next, is there any thing else I can do? I've searched around support forums but most people seem to have solved the problem through any of the aforementioned solutions, and I sadly haven't so far. Any help would be appreciated, was really excited to try this game out!</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Hey guys and gals! Kinda new to keto, been doing it for about 2-3 weeks and its been going fine. I rarely if ever drink alcohol, but im thinking of making an exception tonight, gonna see some old friends. My question is, if i go out and drink a moderate to high amount of normal craft beer, will i be knocked out of ketosis? I hate wine and strong alcohol, so beer is the only thing that works for me. Im also kind of in the mood to have some beers too, been over 6 months since last time.</TEXT>

    <TITLE>Really bad news from my dads doctor</TITLE>
    <DATE>2019-04-24 16:35:26</DATE>
    <TEXT>My dad har been struggling with myeloma (cancer in plasma cells) for the last five years, and his health has been steadily getting worse and worse. After years of terrifying nights in the hospital, five cases of pneumonia and more instances of sepsis due to his immune system being wiped out by treatments, my mom and dad got terrible news today from our doctor. His cancer values have skyrocketed and his last treatment has not been effective. We now stand with but one choice left, which is a stem cell transplant with his chance of surviving being 75%. I know that this number seems high, but this procedure is just the beginning of our problems as he will be extremely weak and his body will break down during the weeks after IF he survives. This shouldnt come as a shock to me and my family, but we have all lived in a kind of fantasy world where we try to live our lives as if my father hasnt been dying these years. There is no cure for myeloma, and my fathers cancer has been particularly aggressive. i feel so bad, numb, hopeless and scared for me and my family's future. I have never had a job, and my whole world might and life might be fundamentally changed in the coming weeks. im so scared, and so angry at the total randomness that our lives are dictated by when it comes to these kind of diseases that have nothjing to do with bad habits or anything... I try to think that loads of people have survived a loss of a parent, and can still smile somehow, but i really have no idea if thats ever gonna be a possibility for me if the wor~~~~st is to happen. i have a deep tendency for depression and introversion and i can just see myself go down a path of total isolation and darkness</TEXT>

    <TITLE>How to not make the witcher 3 paused when alt+tabbed?</TITLE>
    <DATE>2019-06-03 13:09:16</DATE>
    <TEXT> gt;!So, as the titles says how do I not make the witcher 3 pause when im alt+tabbed? I have two monitors and the game set to "borderless window" so the game itself doesnt tab down and minimize itself when i switch monitors, but sometimes during the game I want to be able to see what someone wrote on facebook or whatever. I know some of your might think that a true fan of the franchise should be attentive and immersed in the game 100% whenever you play it, but sometimes I have other important things that might need my attention for just a few seconds, and during those seconds it would be nice if the game didnt pause/freeze. ! lt;
      #8203;  gt;!Does anyone know if this is possible? I've searched around but havent made any progress in solving this issue.! lt;
     Thanks in advance!</TEXT>

    <TITLE>Serious question about IF with BED</TITLE>
    <DATE>2019-08-14 20:46:14</DATE>
    <TEXT>So, I tried intermittent fasting for about a month and didnt feel bad or anything. Thing is though, I didnt really notice the bad habits I started to get into when I was in my eating window. I wouldnt eat during 18 hours, then during the 6 hours of eating, I would just let go of most of my inhibitions when it comes to quantity of food eaten and what I was eating. Anyways, zoom ahead 6 months and Im still very ridden with bad food associations and a lot of self-destructive thoughts about me, my body and my self-worth that I wasnt experiencing to this degree before my relatively short bout in IF. Just to make something clear, this is in no way a critique of IF or fasting in general as I have seen from this subreddit and on many other places that it works wonders for people. I just wanted to ask you that suffers from BED (binge eating disorder) or some other form of destructive eating habits if you have had the same experience or if you have any tips on what I can do now? I've already sought help from a eating disorder center, but they cant help me until febuary next year.</TEXT>

My father will never "beat" his cancer, but thats not because of any fault of his, its just an incurable form of cancer.

    <TEXT>Free feom the horrible pain, anxiety and panic that he had to endure for five years. After multiple treatments for his cancer, his heart gave up. Me and my family was always there for him when he was in the hospital, and he was always there to comfort me and give me advice. He died so suddenly, it felt absolutely unreal. My two sisters and my mom are absolutely heartbroken. We are still a family and we look after eachother. But I will never forget you. How you used to smile and show me new music you found. Our taste in music was very different, but it didnt matter. I loved how you would smile when I woke up and you would ask how I had slept. During his time of illness, me and my dad became very close. We used to hug eachother, lean on one another and all sorts of lovely things. My life will never be the same, and I dont want it to be. You hated how much the cancer affected us children, the anxiety and just plain fatigue from everything. Now you are at peace, and I will do my best to live with you in my heart. I will never, ever forget you dad. You were the most honest, loving and compassionate person I ever knew. I hope you knew that. I am so damn lost. I dont know what I am supposed to feel, what I am supposed to do. My friends have all offered support to me, but I dont want to talk them about this yet. It has only been 6 hours. How the hell am I gonna manage my adult life without your advice. It felt like you knew everything. I know nothing and feel like nothing also. Everything feels like a surreal dream</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Im so sorry, this sounds absolutely dreadful. That cognitive dissonance you speak of is still present to me to this day, even though my dad died three months ago. Sometimes I can, for just a moment, realize with both my brain and my heart that he is in fact gone. Those brief moments feel like a gut punch through my entire being, I lose my breath and my heart skips a beat. There isnt much to say in situations like these. Just know that so many people throughout the history or mankind have gone through what you are going through and somehow made it out alive. I know it feels like that wont happen to you, but cling on to friends and family if you have those present in your life. You also describe what some would call "magical thinking", that you somehow can affect the outcome of your fathers life. Its your own attempt to ascribe yourself with some kind of control during situations where you feel powerless. completely normal and everyone does this during times of great tragedy and sorrow. I would however advise you to become cognizant of when you do this going forward because it can be a sure fire way of ascribing nonsensical tasks or duties to yourself, like "I cannot allow myself to feel hope for myself and my future, cuz then Im 'jinxing' it and something horrible might happen.

If i try, I cant get a sound out and if I try to force it my mouth just contracts and expands rapidly. What I do is I have small methods for making things easier in the day to day-living. Like another one already said, tricking your brain into making two words into one. So, if I wanted to start a sentence with "If I want to do that..." I change it to "...n-If i want to do that..." like I said the word "and" under my breath but shortening it so it becomes "n-If" etcetera. Or adding a "Well..." before the name that start with a vowel or "But..." before the name or whatever. Hope it helps somewhat.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>First of all, just because someone doesnt share your viewpoint doesnt mean they are gullible. Fine, you didnt say that TO's made lots of money but you did say that they werent starved of income. The simple fact that TO's and sponsors are leaving the competitive dota 2 scene shows that something is amiss in this equation. I actually did complain before Valve's decision, so I am consistent on that. This thought experiment of yours seems fruitless unless you were trying to convey some sort of message behind it. There's tons of these examples in conspiracy theories, and you need not search for more than a minute to find that people aren't stating facts, they are just "asking questions" when challenged. To say that nothing is implied in your post is just plain dishonest. Lastly, the passage about TO's finding a way to extort money out of Valve can not in any way be seen as a thought experiment. It is neither a fact but an utterance of an opinion. This opinion seems extremely far-fetched without some sort of evidence to back it up. That is why I said that i could not fathom someone actually believing this to be real if they were not engaged in conspiracies. A lot of "woke" people are in reality completely surrounded by all sorts of delusional claims, completely unaware.</TEXT>

    <TITLE>6 months since my dad passed away</TITLE>
    <DATE>2020-10-19 10:36:11</DATE>
    <TEXT>...and I still feel so lost. I've heard from my grief counselor that I made progress during the 3-4 months I talked to her, but I just saw a picture of my dad wearing his favorite football teams jersey and cap. That just threw me all the way back. I just got the feeling that so much has happened in such a short time, but just 7 months ago it was so normal for me to have my dad in my life, in my everyday struggles. Fast forward this short amount of time and he is not here, and he will never be here again. I wont see his smile or feel his embrace ever again for as long as I am alive. It just feels utterly unimaginable that this is my reality. How can it be like this? It's like I can't come to terms with this new life that I am forced to acclimate to. Just fucking why? Why did it have to be my dad, the sweetest and most caring person I ever met? It's so unfair it breaks my heart. Everyone says that things get better with time, but I'm just afraid that things get better because my memories of father starts to dissolve over time and my feelings for him might fade away. I don't want that to happen. I want my memories and feelings to stay as intense as they are today and as they were when he was still alive. I don't want them to fade away, because then it feels like his very existence never even mattered.</TEXT>
