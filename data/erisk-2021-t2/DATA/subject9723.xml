    <TITLE>Lymph nodes on dogs neck varing in size, combined with very bad breathe.</TITLE>
    <DATE>2019-11-25 23:59:13</DATE>
    <TEXT>-Dog -Female -3 years old -Mixed breed: Labrador / formosan mountain dog -Approx 42 pounds -Rescued 1.5 years ago from Taiwan now lives in Toronto Canada. -Varying size in nodes has been going on about 1 year. Bad breath about 6 months. -history of food allergies to beef, chicken, lamb, fish. Now on raynes kanagroo low fat dry food and doing very well. Symptoms of allergies would be ear infections, hair loss, and discolored/ scabby skin. 1. So Ive always been able to feel the lymph nodes on my dogs neck but I did always notice they could vary in size from day to day but in the last 6 months ive noticed that the lymph nodes are consistently quite large and even though I do feel a difference in size from day to day sometimes , I notice its not going to back to a smaller size like it used to. Its always pretty large. Feels like half a golf ball in both sides of her neck ( under her ears) . Both lymph nodes seem to match each other in size. 2. When i got my dog she didnt have the greatest teeth. 1 year ago i got them professionally clean and some teeth extracted. I have found it difficult to keep her teeth clean since as it seems the tartar just keeps building up even with brushing. The last 6 months have been a bit alarming as her breathe has been VERY bad and even after brushing I can still smell it. 3. She recently had to go on a round of antibiotics for infected anal glands. I dont know if they were infected for sure but I guess the doctor was being cautious. The reason ive linked the lymph nodes with the bad breath is because when on the antibiotics her lymph nodes shrunk dramatically to where I couldn't really feel them while petting her anymore and her bad breath got better! When she went off the antibiotics ive noticed her nodes slowly getting bigger and her bad breathe coming back. When i last went to the vet she was only a few days off the antibiotics so I was told to monitor. The vet was thinking if I came back she would test for tonsillitis. So my question is what does this sound like to you? Does it sound like it could be tonsillitis or something else? What kind of tests should I do? Is there anything I could do with food or oral care that may remedy this that I can try without doing expensive testing. Overall my dog seems happy and healthy. No signs to me of illness. Thank you!</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I have HS pretty much nonstop. I always have a few spots going but once in a while Ill get a really bad flare where either the wound is extra bad or I flare up badly im multiple places. Its always tiring to be going about your day hurting but when I have these really bad flare ups I mean I feel sick! I don't know if I flair up because im getting sick and my immune system is down or if I flare up and cause my immune system to go down and I catch a cold. But I have a particularly angry one right now and my throat hurts, i have aches and pains, feels like im about to fever, i feel like im fighting something else off and Im also feeling really moody like i want to cry. Anyone else get this where it feels like your fighting an infection?</TEXT>

    <TITLE>[Discussion] Am I a bad owner? Sometimes I think my dog would have been better off adopted by someone else.</TITLE>
    <DATE>2019-12-16 01:34:36</DATE>
    <TEXT>Today my dog ran out of the house and got hit by a car. They think she is going to be okay but she is still not completely out of the woods and she has a terrible wound she will have to recovery from. I recently moved back in with my mom due to health issues and my dog came with me. We used to have 4 cats so she knows the deal with doors n stuff but this is the 2nd time she left the door wide open and my dog ran out. Because of my fear of this I have been trying to train her. She will stay if we tell her to but my mom didnt she just left the door open. Ive also been to recall training and working on it with her everyday. Even have her on a long leash now and she comes running to me whenever I call but when she gets out of the house she is sooo excited she just runs around and thinks its fun but has no fear of the road or cars. Ive let her off leash a few times and she just doesnt listen. Shes so excited, and wants to explore everything, shell come eventually but not when she has that initial rush. She was a rescue from taiwan so I guess shes a little more wild than other dogs but I cant help but think im not a good enough owner. That i havent worked hard enough to train her or spent enough money to do it. Is this common with dogs? Even if their trained to run off? Are some dogs just not ever able to be off leash? I feel so guilty and just feel like she would have been better off with someone else and shes an absolute sweetheart and adorable. Im sure someone else would have rescued her. Maybe it was selfish of me. I just dont know what to do Im just racked with guilt.</TEXT>

    <TITLE>Emergency rooms are not for colds!</TITLE>
    <DATE>2019-12-21 22:19:50</DATE>
    <TEXT>I am sitting in the hospital and literally 90% of the people here are adults with colds or kids with colds. Everyone here is bright eyed,on their phones,laughing and talking as normal, noone here even seems that sick! If your kid can sit in an emergency room playing and eating Tim hortons they can do that at home! They are not that sick and can be seen by a walk in clinic today or tomorrow. Everyone here is clogging up the system. When did people stop hearing the EMERGENCY in Emergency room. This is not a walk in clinic. This is suppose to be life or death and serious injury shit. Im sitting here in real pain with likely moderate pancreatitis and these guys are here getting prescriptions filled for antibiotics and children's Tylenol. Have some respect for people and some brains. Your child or you are not dying of a cold. Unless they are vomiting profusely with a high temp they dont belong in the emergency room. Kids cough, and vomit, and get fevers. Its a normal part of being sick. Can you please google some damn home care remedies before you bring yourself or your kid to the hospital. All your doing is skyrocketing the wait time, annoying the hell outta doctors, and making more people sick. You are the reason our hospitals are going to shit and racking up 5-7 hr wait times. Edit: This post is about universal health care countries. The USA is a completely different system. In countries with universal health care there are loads of other options available for non-emergencies and for this reason having an emergency room wait 2-7 hours long is absolutely ridiculous and unnecessary in these countries.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I'm experiencing the longest depression I've ever had. Going on 7 years now. I've been depressed so long that I don't even know who I am anymore. I have such an unhealthy hatred for myself that even when Im motivated to try to like myself I don't even know who that is anymore. I feel like I have no identity and I know thats common with BPD but I feel as though its often talked about like you act different depending on who your with and thats not what I mean. I think I used to have a pretty good idea of who I was but now I dont know how to be anything anymore. My head is so jumbled with noise I can't even try to think through it logically. I couldn't describe myself if I had to anymore. I just don't know how to go about building a personality again. It seems so weird to have to think about... What am i like? Who am I? What kind of person am I? What kind of things do I say? Ive isolated myself from so many people for so long I actually get overwhelmed by any conversations because I just dont know who I am enough to know how to respond. It sounds over exaggerated and like im overthinking it but I really feel like this hollow body that just has nothing in it and im genuinely asking... How do you make a self identify again?</TEXT>

Since then I've struggled a lot and today the psychiatrist formally diagnosed PTSD. Since this is all new to me I was wondering if anyone who has been dealing with it for a while has any advice? Maybe something they wish they knew at the beginning? Something that can help? Or somethings to look out for? Im not sure I just thought maybe I have symptoms I don't even realize are PTSD symptoms and awareness seems to be the first step to getting better. What would you tell your newly diagnosed self if you could go back in time?</TEXT>

    <TITLE>I really wish Bernie supporters would stop trolling online. Your really giving a bad imagine for his supporters</TITLE>
    <DATE>2020-02-11 05:21:08</DATE>
    <TEXT>The so called "bernie bros" ,which btw, is an awful title to spread around because it makes it sound like his core is all young frat boys when in fact his supporters are women and men alike from all walks of life. It makes it seem like Bernie is a young man's candidate when Bernie himself has been a champion for women as well. I just think it gives the media and his opponents easy ways to push untruths about him like he's a misogynist n shit like that which is not true. As a whole the people who are being aggressive towards other candidates online and that have become known as 'internet trolls' really need to stop if they truly want a bernie victory. The view of the "bernie bros" is going from young progressive minds to rude, relentless, extreme supporters. We are being compared to the base of Trump. I think its obvious but Ill spell out what that means... ITS FUCKING BAD! We are the FURTHEST thing from Trumps base but your brazen hate especially for other democratic candidates is ugly and it is NOT what Bernie is about. Bernie is for the people. He cares about america as a whole and if you are a true believer in Bernie you would know this is not the message he wants out there. You are really making it easy for the press and his rivals to make him seem like a left trump and he is the furthest thing from it. I am saying this because I truly believe Bernie can change the USA for the greater. He has the right intentions, the experience, and the ideals to lead the USA into the future and this troll like base that has emerged is going to be his downfall. This is perfect material for the opposition to use. Trump is Hate. Bernie is inclusivity. Please, Bernie supporters we are better and smarter than this. Lets show the rest of America what its like to be the bigger person and proceed with facts, dignity, and respect. I promise you we will go much farther without tearing down Bernie's opponents in such a disgraceful way. Please don't let this be Bernie's legacy. We've got a long fight ahead. I pray that people will see this, agree, spread the word, call out those who are being nasty, so we can change the untruthful narrative that has started. Thank you</TEXT>

    <TITLE>Question for competitive/elite gymnasts. Are you required to do ballet?</TITLE>
    <DATE>2020-03-11 04:17:07</DATE>
    <TEXT>I was a competitive dancer but did do gymnastics and acro as well. Now I teach acro dance. You can really tell when gymnasts have ballet training and clearly it really helps with technique on floor, bars, and beam. It seems places like the USA really push for power over grace and obviously its working for them but I don't understand why they wouldn't want to encourage ballet for the dance elements in gymnastics. I mean some of these power gymnasts are so cringy when it comes to any dance element. The same goes for floor choreography. Why not hire a dance choreographer to help for the steps in between the tumbling? Im sure this has been discussed before but it always bothers me and I just wish I could get in a gym to train along side the gym coaches lol. I see a lot of european teams really developing their athletes dance technique and it makes for stunning work on those 3 above apparatus. Am I wrong to think the US doesn't require this training of their elites? Is their strategy just stack the difficulty so execution doesn't matter as much?</TEXT>

    <TITLE>[Help] Sudden tremor in my dogs front leg</TITLE>
    <DATE>2020-05-21 23:52:26</DATE>
    <TEXT>My dogs front leg has started shaking. Shes a 4 year old, 45 pound lab mix. Its the first time ive noticed it. Shes not hurt as she has no pain reaction to touch and is walking normally. When I wrap my hang around the leg I can feel the tremor. Feels like a muscle spasm or something. Shes acting normal and doesn't seemed too bothered by it. Its noticeable when shes lying down but she isn't limping when she walks or anything. Just checking if anyone else has experienced this and if I should just keep an eye on it or if it could be a sign of a bigger problem? I have seen her leg shake before but only when shes standing and pushes up onto the top part of her paw. I always figured it shakes because its just not a sturdy position like when we go on the balls of our feet to reach something. But now im thinking maybe ive been missing something?</TEXT>

    <DATE>2020-05-26 21:27:39</DATE>
    <TEXT>I moved from downtown Vancouver to suburban Toronto and have noticed a big difference in the behaviour of the owners here compared to Vancouver. Vancouver owners were generally great. Always had their dogs leashed unless in designated unleashed areas, watched and stayed close to their dogs while around others, corrected bad behaviour, and just seemed generally a lot more respectful to their fellow owner. Where I am now its the opposite and we've had so many run ins with bad dogs and careless owners that I cant go to the parks anymore and have anxiety everytime I take my dog out because I never know when we'll run into a badly behaved unleashed dog. I got my dog in Vancouver and it's just ruined the whole experience of having a dog since bringing her here. We stay in quite a bit now and its depressing. Just curious what places you've been/lived where the dog owner community is above par.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>My dog is a rescue and when I got her she ended up gaining a ton of weight because I was feeding her the recommended amount of food listed on the bag. I had to keep cutting back her portions because my vet said she was overweight. Shes now at a healthy weight and we've figured out the perfect food for her allergies so everything is all good. Vet says she healthy but sometimes I am shocked that according to the foods weight limits shes eating the same amount as a dog half her size. Just curious if anyone else experiences this as well. * she is a 4 yr old, female, FMD/Lab mix. Approx 44lbs. Regular walks daily but not a super active dog. Has allergies to protein. Shes on a low fat kangaroo diet.</TEXT>

    <DATE>2020-05-29 21:28:34</DATE>
    <TEXT>I have been in a semi successful recovery period. I say semi because ive had a few slip ups along the way but have managed to reduce my binges significantly through quitting diets, not focusing on weight loss, and trying to eat a balance of foods. Because ive found success from not restricting ( ive lost 50 pounds) I still have some yummy food around the house like chocolate, cheese, pizza, and allow myself to eat it as i please which helps to avoid binging but I do have trigger foods that I try to avoid as the food itself can cause a binge. One of those for me is milk chocolate and other sugary foods. Ive been buying dark chocolate instead lately and ive noticed I dont binge it. I find it so strong that I actually get sick of it after a while and can only eat so much of it. Im eating a lot less and because it has less sugar I don't feel the regular physical consequences of eating chocolate ( like acne, headache, mood changes, triggering other cravings, etc). Don't get me wrong I could still binge on it if I was in a bad place but just thought its a good option for someone who's trigger are sweets. You still get to eat chocolate but it may not be as triggering as other foods.</TEXT>

    <TITLE>Dermaplaning has made a huge difference in my skin post acne recovery</TITLE>
    <DATE>2020-06-09 04:43:33</DATE>
    <TEXT>I was able to finally clear up my cystic acne after 10 years due to some diet changes. But the skin that was left was not nice. Dryness, redness ,scars, pigmentation, huge pours and textured skin. I was buying a ton of products for all of it and nothing seemed to make a difference until i dermaplaned. I decided to dermaplane because I could feel i had a ton of dead skin that chemical exfoliants just weren't taking off. I used the schick silk touch up tool to do it at home. It was actually incredibly easy. My face was very smooth and did look fresher after but It still wasn't as clear and texture free as I wanted it to be. Since then Ive been using my products religiously YTP cleanser, Vitamin C Oil, niacinimade, and retinol. I found that 3 weeks after doing the dermaplaning that my skin is starting to looking like healthy new skin again and i think its because the dermaplaning allowed the products to absorb better into my skin and actually work as needed. I dont have textured skin anymore my redness is gone and the pigmentation has reduced so Id endorse doing dermaplaing at home. You can get it done at and office as well where they do a much better thorough job but this was enough for what i needed. I dont know if id continue to do it. Cause its kind of like shaving your face but it gave my face a reset which i am greatful for. I am now on track to have clear beautiful skin and just though Id share my experience with it.</TEXT>

    <TITLE>I am not a fan of BPD terminology like FP and Splitting. I think it can be a major hindrance in recovery</TITLE>
    <DATE>2020-06-10 22:00:23</DATE>
    <TEXT>I think knowledge is power so I think it's great that people learn and understand the concept of "favourite person" and "splitting" but Ive noticed on this sub it can take on a life of its own. It goes from being just a word to describe an action to a word to describe all your problems. I think putting such strong emphasis on these terms especially when you label another human being with these things is detrimental. If you use the word FP to describe your boyfriend or friend you're taking away the humanity of that person. Instead of being a friend theyve become a product of your disorder. They are no longer just a friend with their own wants, needs, and wishes they are now an FP. A direct connection to your disorder and ultimately a determining factor in your happiness or misery. Of course everything they do is going to affect you if you've put that label on them. I'm not saying FPs aren't a thing but I also think many people experience strong feelings for people without it being disordered thinking and I think a lot of people experience bad feelings towards ppl when they let them down without it being disordered thinking. I think by labeling FPs you are sentencing that relationship to always be disordered instead of working to normalize it. Same idea goes for splitting. It's a term health professionals can use to describe a pattern of behaviour/thinking but not everything you experience as black and white will be a symptom of BPD. Lots of people see the world as black and white. Its a lesson many people have to learn and instead of combating this type of thinking I see people experiencing anxiety and stress because they see everything they do as splitting. The label causes more trouble then the actual issue. I personally think it would be beneficial to throw these terms out the window and just take each situation as they are. Use the appropriate DBT skills for the moment and forget the lables. I think its easier to hide behind a term to describe your behaviour then to just look at the situation as what it is and sort it out. I do not use these terms personally because I do not believe all my behaviours are BPD behaviours. I think many of my behaviours and emotions are valid and normal. I do believe by not falling into this label game with my emotions it is easier to normalize them and therefore more effectively deal with them as well as feel less judgement and shame towards myself. You are not borderline personality disorder. You are someone who has borderline personality disorder. Not every action, emotion, and thought you have is due to your disorder and I think labelling all our emotions with such strong BPD labels can leave you stuck in a world where you feel you are not normal and your emotions/actions are all problematic. This is not the case. Not the case at all.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>My dog had hyperkeratosis on the side of her nose for as long as I can remember. I tried a stick balm but she went nuts trying to wipe it off I think due to the scent. I got this organic product from amazon with no scent and I was shockingly surprised how quick and well it worked. For the first few days when I would rub it on she would lick it right off. That wasnt ideal but I was still seeing improvement. I changed to putting it on right before she ate and that did the trick. 5-6 days later it was completely cleared. She didnt have any reactions or tummy issues due to eating it. Its been a huge success and im just so happy with the results i thought id share. I know pugs and other breeds are susceptible to this issue my so i thought id share. I got it on Amazon. The name of the company is Over the Moon Pets and its Organic Dog Nose Balm. Im not affiliated with the company in any way. Just thought id share a good experience after a few bad ones with popular balm brands.</TEXT>

    <TITLE>Almost relapsed due to sneaky disordered thinking. Don't fall into the trap!</TITLE>
    <DATE>2020-06-12 23:06:59</DATE>
    <TEXT>I've been pretty successful with recovery for the last 7 months. I kicked it by giving up diets, stopped weighing myself, stopped obsessing about my weight, accepted the fact I was using food as an unhealthy coping mechanism for sadness, and just ate regularly with no restrictions. Today I almost had a relapse because my disordered thinking snuck up on me. I started weighing myself again just to see the progress I had made as I felt like I was loosing weight and I just wanted to see if I was. That somehow turned into weighing myself weekly just to keep tabs on if I was still loosing. Convincing myself it wasnt about loosing weight it was just curiosity. So without realising I was back to being focused on my weight. I should mention ive lost 60 pounds WITHOUT being focused on weight loss. Anyways its all fine until I weigh myself today and I didnt lose any weight this past week. That brought on an instant strong urge to binge. I was ready to say fuck it and give in after all this time. Luckily ive been at this a while and was very aware the eating disorder had snuck its way back. I understood the binge urge was related to the ultimate "failure" I felt by not loosing weight but on top of that I was so upset I had let myself fall into the trap again. It felt like I had control over the weighing because I wasnt doing it everyday and had simply convinced myself I didnt care about the weight. I know that weighing myself is a recipe for binging but after a while you start to think you have more control when you havent binged for so long. It sucks to know im just someone who cant do that without crashing and burning. I'm sad that i obviously still suffer with BED even if im not actively binging. I am thankful that ive learned the lesson so hopefully next time It wont happen. Just thought id share the experience as a cautionary tale of how something that seems so innocent can cause a relapse.</TEXT>

    <TITLE>Anyone else having difficulty viewing graphic wound pictures?</TITLE>
    <DATE>2020-06-19 04:16:44</DATE>
    <TEXT>I absolutely appreciate people wanting to share their experience with HS. I think there is an appropriate place in this sub for sharing in this way but having extremely graphic wound photos show up on my feed makes me very uncomfortable considering I have no option whether i want to view them or not. They are just there. I have HS and have bad flares. Its not that we dont all know what they look like but people can have physical and psychological reactions to seeing such graphic content and id like to just suggest the mods put a blurred filter and graphic content label on the photos. This way people have the choice to click on the post and see the photo or to scroll by it if it makes them uncomfortable. I am in other HS groups on facebook that do this and I am suggesting we do this too. Ive noticed an uptick in this kind of content and would really appreciate it if I was given a choice whether to view or not. I live with this, i know its not pretty, and i know everyones just looking for support but I for one, and I know many others are very sensitive to graphic photos like this so I just ask the mods to put something in place so we can all feel comfortable when on the sub. If you agree it would be great if you could msg the mods as well or give this an upvote. Thank you. And i want to say very clearly im not singling anyone out nor do I think anyone did anything wrong. I think it's just a blind spot on this sub. I think people should absolutely keep posting whatever they like Im just requesting some options for those of us who have a tough time viewing images of a graphic nature.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Buying puppies fuels this type of shit. Instead of waiting for a puppy to be available with a shelter or adopting a younger adult bulldog people are paying $3000-$4000 to terrible people that do shit like this. Hundreds of those dogs may not make it. Your probably thinking, thats not me, I researched where I got my dog from. You don't know. Many of the people purchasing these dogs are completely unaware of how the person is getting them. When you make something into a business the profit WILL ALWAYS come before the welfare of these animals. Thats how greed works. Dogs should not be a bussiness. They should be rescued. There are thousands of dogs AND puppies who need homes that are not being sold for a profit. Stop giving money to greedy people and criminals!

    <DATE>2020-07-15 01:44:48</DATE>
    <TEXT>I just tried Herbivores Blue Tansy Resurfacing Mask from Sephora and my god seriously the results after just one use are amazing. I've struggled with cystic acne for 10 years. I've finally started to see a reduction with diet change but the texture of my skin was still awful. No matter what products I tried the texture stayed. Ive also been dealing with big pores and sebaceous filaments that I couldnt get rid of. WELL! With one 20 minute treatment my face is baby butt soft! I havent felt my skin feel like this in years! Also all the sebaceous filaments on my nose disappeared! I am really floored and thought I should share this as I buy a lot of raved review products from Sephora; drunk elephant, the ordinary, olehenrekson, first aid beauty, etc and ive just never seen results this quickly with a product. It is expensive. Its stupid expensive for a mask. I debated for months before i gave in and bought it but of all the acids, creams, masks, retinols, etc, this has actually made a difference in my skin. I look forward to seeing the results with continued use. I duno hows its working on my acne as its definitely too soon to tell but my face does feel a lot less inflamed then it did before the mask. Anyways just excited! Lol anyone else have a similar experience?</TEXT>

    <TITLE>I used binge eating as a form of self harm and even though ive recovered my body hasn't (PSA/Rant)</TITLE>
    <DATE>2020-07-25 04:40:54</DATE>
    <TEXT>When your in the thick of BED your biggest concern is usually your weight and it makes sense since BED is very much related to our self image problems but at my worst I was so depressed that I was actively trying to use food to end my life. I knew I couldn't do it myself so my thought was I'll eat myself to death. Ill get a disease or something eventually and I can just go "naturally" . I've been in recovery now 8 months and it started by focusing on my mental health...... but guess what....ive spent the last 8 months in recovery for BED and almost a year working on my depression/ other mental illnesses to finally after 7 straight years of hell find some stability and hope for the future. I am finally ready to start living my life again BUT my past still haunts me. I did so much damage to my body especially in the last year of my BED that im not recovering physically. Ive lost 70 pounds and am still loosing. I thought my body would fix itself since ive lost so much weight and am soooo much healthier now but I think the damage may be done. I still have digestive issues even though Ive removed inflammatory foods from my diets, my blood pressure is higher than its ever been even at my heaviest, and my organs are not functioning properly. Im going to test after test because im in constant pain and I just know it's one of my organs thats damaged due to the shit I put it through. When I was at my worst I had to have emergency gall bladder surgery, i had fatty liver disease, and my spleen was enlarged. It all made sense then but why am i still having issues now! After 70 pounds loss and a massive turnaround of my diet? I guess the take away from this is... Forget about your weight. Weight loss can happen and will happen if you recover from BED. You can loose weight at any time though. You always will have time to loose weight but if you keep going the way your going your body may never heal from the damage your doing to it now. You could put in all the hard work and end up recovered but then be like me and still suffering. Place the importance on mental health and physical health because a nice body doesnt matter if you cant do anything because your too sick. You finally have your life back and you can't enjoy it because you've damaged your body beyond repair. Its no joke. Binge eating, gaining tons of weight within a relatively short period, eating unhealthy foods, and continuously going from the "on diet", "off diet" , loose weight, gain weight, cycle is detrimental to your health long term. Im in my early 30's and I have the same health problems my 65 year old mother. Im really praying that whats wrong with me isnt permanently damaged because I finally have hope for the future but my body may have other plans for me. Let me be a cautionary tale. Your BED can cause permanent damage to vital organs. Get proper help. Stop dieting. Stop focusing on weight loss. Focus on mental health so you can recover and get out before its too late.</TEXT>

    <TITLE>Vyvanse is not the answer to your binge eating problem.</TITLE>
    <DATE>2020-08-01 15:44:02</DATE>
    <TEXT>I've seen so many Vyvanse posts lately its incredibly alarming. Binge eating disorder has nothing to do with your appetite an "appetite suppressor" is not going to cure your binge eating disorder. At best it will curb symptoms for a little while at worst you'll have terrible side effects and maybe even become addicted to it because its a derivative of amphetamines. Binge eating disorder is 100% psychological. It is a mental health disorder. Vyvanse has nothing to do with mental health unless you have ADHD. The only reason doctors are prescribing it for binge eating disorder is because it has a side effect of reducing your appetite. You know what other drug has that side effect, crystal meth. Does anyone think crystal meth is going to help their binge eating disorder? Maybe in the short term , not in the long term. Your honestly better off taking an antidepressant for binge eating disorder than Vyvanse. At least an antidepressant has the ability to lift your mood which could help you with your emotional health. People with BED need therapy. They have self image issues and coping skills issues. They need to learn healthy coping skills, learn how to deal emotions effectively and learn how to curb destructive thoughts/beliefs about their self image. None of that will come from a pill im sorry to say. I know it's easier to think about taking a pill a day then spending hours doing the mental hard work of learning and facing emotions but thats the only long term way out i promise you. Taking a pill is not going to stop you from binge eating when you have an extreme emotional response to something. Even if you're not hungry you will eventually binge because that is the only way you know how to cope. You need an overhaul of how your brain thinks and works and Vyvanse is not that. Look at those that post success stories. They all have a similar theme. I stopped dieting, stopped counting, stopped weighing, and focused on my mental health. Ive been in recovery 8 months. Ive lost 70 pounds. All without a diet or exercise purely from therapy. My perspective had to change and i needed to gain the skills to manage my emotions. No pill can do that for you. If you want to beat BED long term therapy is the way. Ive found most success with Dialectical Behavioural Therapy. Its not specific to BED but gives you all the skills you need to start to concur it. CBT is a great therapy as well. There are BED specific programs out there now. They revolve alot around intuitive eating. In my experience a combination of a BED program and DBT or CBT therapy is best. If you are looking for a therapist, psychologist, or social worker try to find one that has training in DBT. That's my suggestion. If you can't get to a therapist. DBT has lots of info online. They have books on amazon. There are binge eating books out there now. You have to attack this from a mental health perspective. The type of food you eat, when you eat, how much you eat, your appetite, your willpower, none of this has to do with the reason you are binge eating. It all has to do with your emotional health. That's where recovery will come from. Edit: i am not knocking vyvanse for ADHD treatment or as treatment in combination with therapy. Nor am I saying other medications cant help with BED. There are many underlining issues that can result in BED. I am saying Vyvanse as your first and ONLY treatment is not going to solve your binge eating issue long term.</TEXT>

    <TITLE>Do you think this episode was a good indication of what's actually going on?</TITLE>
    <DATE>2020-08-10 20:32:36</DATE>
    <TEXT>So I dont watch the live feeds. I catch up on feeds by reading the daily summary of feeds lol but I try not to spoil too much for myself so i try not to get too ahead of the episode. i am only caught up to Sundays episode of live feeds but from what I understand Cody was supposedly confused as to why Kaysar choose to do the safety competition because they thought they had a good conversation and was even thinking to align with him. Then after the comp supposedly they had another conversation and Kaysar said he got a confusing vibe and they put it all behind them as a misunderstanding but this episode makes it seem like Cody WAS going to put Kaysar and Janelle up. So my question is do you think the show is accurately describing whats going on in the house right now or did the show make it seem like Kaysar was the target but he really wasn't. Just curious if i should follow the feeds a little more closely or if I can still get the true jist of whats going on from the episode. I know the feeds tell a fuller story but did the show totally misrepresent what happened? Or am I wrong in thinking Cody wasn't planning to put Kaysar up? Thanks!</TEXT>

    <TITLE>Crumbly Town Software LLC - SCAM</TITLE>
    <DATE>2020-08-11 16:44:53</DATE>
    <TEXT>They are doing a job scam. Offering people remote work. I applied through Indeed in Canada. . I was offered the job of a Team Assistant with no interview. They sent me a contract which I did not open in case of a virus. I asked for a number to contact her to discuss the contract as their supposed telephone number didn't actually link to a real person. I have received no more communication with them since I asked. Before I got "hired" they asked me for my name, number, e-mail, and said the job required a smartphone with a camera and to confirmed I had one. Then they sent me the contract for employment and asked to send a piece of photo ID like a driver's license, birth certificate, or passport (which I did not send). While looking into the company they do have a website but it's covered in spelling and grammatical errors. When I google earthed their address it was a strip mall to which I saw no sign or proof they existed in that area. When you call their number it is an automated message about them providing consultation work and to hold the line to speak to someone at which they play music and no one ever comes on the phone. I found a few LinkedIn profiles of people who had Crumbly Town Software LLC listed as their employment so it seems they did a little extra work to be convincing but when looking up the names of the people I saw on Linkedin, the people I spoke with from the company, and the supposed president of the company I came up with nothing on the internet. No social media, no news, no previous work, these people were all ghosts. They have applied for a business name so they do appear to have registered their business but again I couldn't find any information on the "president". At the time I was researching the company there were no "Scam" indications. It appears someone has picked up on the scam and there is now a scam alert out for them but I wanted to write this to make sure it gets more hits on the internet as they've done a decent job at making the company seem like it may simply be a start-up which would explain it's lack of history online.</TEXT>

I don't think David is judging cody and i dont think cody is doing it on purpose but with what david went through last season and now cody mixing him up a few times with the other black guy in the house I could see how David could interpret that. In a general sense. It was a joke though. David's not really the judging type. He didn't even want to get into the jack, jackson stuff last year.</TEXT>

He already experienced racism last year and I am positive it's not the first time because it hardly ever is for african americans. Who can blame the guy if the white jock in the house starts mixing up the only 2 black guys and his thought is here we go ahead. How is THAT racist? That's his experience and im not David. Who knows what hes thinking. He likely isnt thinking like that because he doesnt seem like the type. It was a joke on my part but if he did think like that i think its a pretty valid feeling to have when youve had those experiences already in that very house.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Dear god of course it is. Have you seen America? It SHOULDN'T. It would be nice! But in america OF COURSE it does. You are straight up ignorant if you dont think someone's race in America doesn't come into play of how they think or act. If someone has been discriminated against by a group of people WHOMEVER that group may be they are going to have a guard up. they are going to have thoughts about it and it will absolutely come into play when interacting with others who are similar. Should people view it that way? Should it be that way? Should everyone get a clean slate? Of course! Of course we should look at the individual and not base them on experiences theyve had with others but its not as simple as that if you've been on the receiving end of racism or discrimination. Its just not. Our brains try to protect us from threats and if weve been "threatened" more than once by a similar group of people is a natural fear thats going to progress and that is human nature and we cant pretend that doesnt exist because then we end up living in an ignorant country that ignores shit until it gets so bad hundreds of thousands have to protest to bring attention to it. Do you watch the news?. Do you listen to any stories from the BLM movement? Its a fantasy world you're living in and maybe one day we can live in this world where shit like that doesn't make a difference but the one we are in now it sure does. In America it sure does. America has a HUGE race issue and it comes into play everyday for millions of americans. I also dont know how many times i have to say it was a fucking joke. We are having this argument over something i was jokingly saying he thought. I am not david. David did not speak to me and tell me he thought this. So lets just all stop assuming anything about david because its stupid we dont know him so im done but i did just want to respond to the ignorant comment so now im done lol.</TEXT>

A full shutdown is tough on the economy of course but so its a rampant pandemic where the economy can never fully get back to 100%. The USA is so far behind in recovery its insane. Where most countries are dealing with their second wave the USA hasnt contained its first. Theres no end in sight right now especially for these southern states because they arent even trying! If the northern states keep doing what they are doing they will be on track to recover with the rest of the developed world unlike the south.</TEXT>

Kamala may make some ppl bitter but Trump is literally setting this country on fire, watching it burn.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Sweden has 10 million people. Canada has 35 million. When you take into consideration the population difference compared to death they almost double us. I come from the mind set that death is the worst possible outcome but maybe you dont see it that way. The truth is our economy and the other countries who did a 4 month strict lock down are going to recover from covid alot faster than america who didnt have a full country lock down and the virus is running wild. While our countries come back online america is going to struggle for far longer because they can't get back to 100% with covid running rampant. It would have served people better to do a strict lock down get shit under control so you would have been open by now like most of the developed world. Instead they are going in and out of lock downs, businesses are half opened or not opened at all people are loosing their jobs and its going to keep going like this for AT LEAST another 6 months because nothing is being done while the rest of the is stabilizing and opening up. I think its going to be MUCH more detrimental to peoples lives to live in an economy that's going to be puttering along barley holding on for the next year than in an economy that fully shut down but was able to recover in a few months. That is going to be the real travesty and that is what is going to cause a depression like era. You cant half ass something like this. The developed world is getting back on track and they all did strict lockdown. The USA is the only one that didnt and its no coincidence they are worse off than all of us.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>This isnt going to go anywhere because you're reference knowledge isn't accurate. You can look up and see that sweden had a much higher death per million rate then Canada did. It's not a simple apples to apples comparison like you are trying to do. There are very simple bar graphs out there that do that math for you and show that canada fared far better than Sweden. As for the rest of it I agree that people can have different opinions but when the opinions are coming from a non factual place its a pointless conversation for me to have because non facts can be skewed to fit any narrative so I think its just best to leave it at that. Im sorry i just cant argue with someone who ignores or skews the facts and maybe you think thats my opinion and thats fine. We are on a big brother sub I really don't have anymore interest in continuing a debate that leads no where. Sorry if that upsets you but im trying to end the conversation as politely as possible.

    <TEXT>I saw the research and she isnt correct. She said that "most people are showing some form of brain damage or heart damage" . Thats not true. There has been cases of stroke and a few instances of neurological damage seen in research patients but the research is young. There is an increase risk of stroke for sure and it seems like corona MAY be linked to neurological and psychiatric complications but it is wrong to say "most people are showing" . Thats simply not true. The studies have been small and the links are not yet confirmed. Small studies do not equal fact and certainly do not mean everyone is being affected. If you read the actual studies and articles on the study it says right on the page that more research is needed. Did hydroxychloroquine teach us nothing about taking small new studies with a grain of salt lol. Research continues because of this reason. Because the first hypothesis or first results are not always the accurate ones. It looks like theres a link but that's all that we can say as 100% fact right now.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I literally just read through the studies. I didnt say a few cases. I said there has been cases of stroke and said there is an increase of stroke. You cant even read my answer correctly no wonder you have no idea what you're talking about. The dr. who ran that German study said herself " elevated NFL levels MIGHT reflect direct tissue destruction from viral replication or from inflammatory damage. Whether this is a transient elevation or a continuous transformation into a degenerative phenotype is yet to be determined" she also said " the high frequency of autoantibodies targeting the brain in the absence of other explanations SUGGESTS a casual relationship to clinical symptoms. While several underlying autoantigens still await identification in FUTURE STUDIES, the presence of autoantibodies MAY explain some aspects of multiorgan disease in Covid 19 and guide immunotherapy in selected cases. Nothing is concluded yet. So maybe get off your high horse and instead of just reading the headlines read the actual papers. Edit: the study your quoting found neurological symptoms presenting in 55% of covid patients not 60% and the interpretation of the study is that it revealed POSSIBLE disruption to micro-structual and functional brain integrity in the recovery stages of covid 29 SUGGESTING the ling term consequences. AGAIN not conclusive.</TEXT>

That is not proven what so ever yet and it was incorrect for her to say that and its ridiculous for you to continue to try to prove that she was not wrong because you clearly know these things arent proven yet. Does it look like theres a connection? Yes clearly. Does that mean MOST people have these issues? No! Because its not even proven its connected yet how can MOST people have it if we havent even determined 100% that it is definitely linked. FACTS MATTER and until a paper comes out that has says there is a definite link between covid and brain damage and 90% of people who got covid now definitely have brain damage what she said is totally misleading!</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Wow some Optometrist clearly did this writer dirty lmao. Ive spent the last 12 years working for optometrists and ophthalmologists in different clinics around the GTA. I can honestly say I have never seen an Optometrist send someone to the emergency room because they simply did not want to treat them due to money. If an Optometrist sends someone to the emergency room its usually because they have a major concern that is time sensitive and needs a specialist or special equipment to get a more accurate diagnoses which many optometrists won't have in house. Some people do get frustrated with optometrists that send them to emergency rooms. Ive seen irate patients come back and yell at a doctor for wasting their time at emergency but this is your eyesight. These doctors don't take it lightly and some eye conditions like a retinal detachment can be extremely time sensitive and if we don't want our patients to go blind we tell them to go to an emergency room. I mean better safe than sorry when it comes to your sight! But of course there are always those that get angry even if youre trying to help. Anyways i truly do not think this is the norm at all. Ive never seen a doctor in any of the practices ive worked at prioritize money over patient care. Does money matter? Of course. Especially doctors who own their own practices but I personally have not seen this money over care mentality and I have worked very closely with a lot of doctors. It just seems like the writer had a shitty experience to me and now wants to generalize the whole industry. It's really a ridiculous article lol.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Theres two things probably going on here because its similar for me. One: its simply a habit. Like seeing an old friend that used to be a drinking buddy and all you can think about it having a beer now lol. If your mom was a constant source of binging for you its understandable that when you hear her or see her you associate her with your binges. Ive been binge free all through corona and i took my first road trip over the weekend. In the past i would binge whatever i wanted when i was on the road so when i went this time i realized just the trip itself had me craving every fast food place i past because i simply associated road trips with binging now. It was quite difficult not to give in. I think it's important to try not to give in to the urge when you see or talk to your mom. I feel when im able to break that pattern a few times the associate with past habits fades and a new normal develops. Two: You have some feelings about your mom that you havent quite dealt with. This is where therapy comes in or skills training. Learning to separate the feeling from eating, learning how to cope with the emotions you feel when with your mom, and working through some of that baggage. Sounds like some form of therapy whether it be 1 on 1 or skills based like DBT or CBT would be very helpful for you in this situation.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>That doesnt mean anything. You can be put on psych hold if you're suicidal or severely depressed. I don't know this Michelle girl so im not vouching for her but I think its in bad taste to refer to anyone who ends up on a psych hold as being "mental". You have no idea why that happened and seeking help for mental illness isn't a reason for someone to all of a sudden become an unreliable source. It's very common for these reality stars to have mental health issues after being on TV especially if they weren't liked. Maybe shes a bad person but what you said just lends to the stigma of psychiatric wards and in 2020 we should be more empathetic and not make assumptions of anyone.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>It seems like bullshit when youre in the thick of the illness. Its just like STFU but it definitely comes from people who have recovered as well. Its not going to solve your mental illness. That takes a lot of therapy and maybe alot of meds lol but ultimately when you start to feel better and learn skills that help you cope better this is one of the principals that you will work on and will help with long term recovery. I think though it doesnt come into play until you've already found some stability with mood. I think a lot of these people either werent AS sick to begin with or recovered but forgot what they had to go through before they could even reach a point where they could examine their own self image. A year ago i was at my worst and i thought the exact same thing as you. Now that ive gotten treatment and my life circumstances has allowed me to focus on my mental health I am in the part of recovery where accepting myself as I am is important for my long term mental health but it didn't start off there. I had a lot of shit I had to come to terms with and work through before getting to this "acceptance" phase. It's just a different stage of recovery thats all. Perhaps youre not there yet but one day it may make more sense to you as it did with me.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>They absolutely can not. People can only pull from their own experiences. Alot of people compare their depression from a break up or some sad event in their life to our chronic BPD depression. They assume because they got through it we can too. Its not really their fault. All they know is what they felt and alot of people assume what they felt must be similar because its all called "depression". It's ignorant to think that but also it's hard to blame them. Its not their fault they dont understand and people give unwanted or shitty advice because they are trying to help. It always comes off as condescending because they just don't understand the complexities of mental illness. I just had to find a different perspective on it. Instead of being annoyed i just appreciated their attempt to help and if I am close with them ill explain to them that they dont need to give advice i just need someone to listen or perhaps even explain how what they say makes you feel worse.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Ive been twice. It was a necessary restart for me. Being in the ward just allows that time to rest, get meds changed or fixed, and be able to focus on just yourself and your mental health. Being there opens up a lot of doors as well to after care programs which are very important for long term recovery. I mean it's not a good time. No time in a hospital is usually a good time lol. It can be very boring and lonely and there are some very sick people there so you certainly experience the spectrum of mental illness which can be educating but also difficult to cope with. It's not as horrible as movies make it out to be and I think the stigma to it is really outdated. I think if you're severely ill with psychosis or other mind altering issues it can probably be very scary and traumatic and I feel for those people. I was almost committed once without my consent and it was a very different situation to when I voluntarily agreed to be committed. It is not fun when you get the choice taken away from you. It is a very traumatic thing to happen but often it is for your benefit. Overall I have been lucky on the sense that Ive had mostly positive experiences with it.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Exactly why healthcare shouldn't be privatized. I live in canada and truly dont know how people do it. I honestly dont think i would have survived in an American health system. Its no wonder so many go untreated there. The medicine is pretty standard practice. It is ridiculous because its brand new medicine and you dont get a choice in the matter. Most of the time its a sedative like seroquel or something which in itself is ridiculous because its an antipsychotic and really shouldn't just be pushed on someone before they have your attending doctors review your drugs but everytime ive been there they do push some sort of sedating medicine on you and i think thats just to make you sleep, keep you calm, and shut you up so you can settle in lol. Its not cool but Unfortuently common practice. And its also common practice to do check ins often. It's a liability issue. It does seem like it would be more important to let people get their sleep but a lot if these ppl are there for fear of harm to themselves so they need to ensure they are in bed, asleep, and yes adjusting to the medication okay.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Salicylic and benzoyl are both very stripping. I agree that you should use one or the other or at least one in the morning one at night but i would not recommend using those together. Niacinamide can usually be mixed fine with most ingredients but it can be a little drying as well so using back to back with the other ingredients may be a little over kill. Make sure to moisturizer no matter what you do. I used salicylic acid for a long time and no moisturizer because i was worried it would cause clog my pores and cause more acne. It also felt good to have the oil off my face. Well it helped in the short term but not the long term as without moisture my skin was producing more oil and basically keeping my acne going. Once i started using moisturizer my face produced a lot less oil and is a lot more manageable now.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I got it under control. Had BED for 18 years. Last year I got up to 300lbs which was my heaviest. Between 14-25 i yo-yo'd between 130 and 200. Up and down constantly. At 25 I started going up and couldn't get it back down like i had before. Struggled HARD for the last 7 years with BED and other issues. This year I finally got it under control and have lost 70lbs and counting. It started with getting my other mental health issues under control first. I have BPD. Many people with BED have an underlining disorder whether that be ADHD, BPD, BD, MDD, OCD, PTSD, I mean so many thing can have a side effect of BED. It's not always the case but its a good thing to explore if you haven't had a proper mental health assessment i would give that a try because you could be missing a big piece of the puzzle. I did go to an eating disorder program as well and it did not help me either because I was struggling with other issues and the fact that my BED was rooted from other things made stuff like intuitive eating and all that useless. It wasnt until I was able to understand why i binged ( ineffective coping mechanism for extreme emotions) that then lead to my recovery. I was put in a DBT program for my BPD. The DBT program is great for my other illnesses but also exactly what i needed for BED. I think even if you dont have BPD, DBT or CBT is a more well rounded program then one that focuses soley on the disorder and thats because it deals with the reason for the disorder and not just the symptoms of the disorder. Anyways im in recovery 9 months now and for the first time in a healthy sustainable way. It is possible but man can it take time and ALOT of perseverance to find the thing that finally works for you or just clicks in mentally.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I felt like that last year too. It just seemed never ending. I was completely hopeless. I was sure my life would never get better and I prayed everyday for it to end. It's really tough man I get it. The only thing you can do is to keep trying. Keep looking for programs, keep speaking with doctors, i know when youve tried everything it seems hopeless but there are lots of people out there that never thought it would get better, me included, and it did. Perhaps you need to put the BED aside and focus on your general mental health. If youve got to the point of having suicidal thoughts there is something else going on whether its depression or another disorder that could be the key to your BED recovery. If you havent already get a mental health assessment, see if youve got anything else going on and treat that first. BED is a lot easier to treat when your mood is more elevated and you've tackled the root cause.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>If you want an eye exam covered typically, yes, there does have to be some obvious signs of an issue. Redness, inflammation, etc. Thats the only way doctors can get it covered is if the eye exam is for health reasons. If there doesn't seem to be a clear issue then a lot will ask for payment because it wont be covered by OHIP otherwise. Now if you do pay and they do find something medically wrong with your eye they should refund you the money and then put it through OHIP but adults know eye exams are not covered unless medically nescessary. Thats OHIPs rule. If every optometrist saw everyone that claimed to have something wrong with their eye with no clear physical indication then everyone would come in and say that just to have a free exam. The doctors can't bill it to OHIP unless there is a suspected issues or a diagnoses. Doctors do need to get paid yes. Just like a dentist wont see you unless you pay. Its because OHIP doesnt cover it. That's an OHIP problem not an Optometrist problem. Optometrists will never turn someone away and this whole article is misleading if "turned away" just means you were unwilling to pay and wanted free care. Well unfortunately eye care isnt free in this country and it needs to be paid by OHIP or by the patient but the doctors arent turning you away you chose to go to the hospital because you didnt want to pay an appointment fee thats different than being turned away for service. You weren't turned away for service. They offered you service and you declined it.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Totally understandable because you hear so much about it but there are clearly families with more than 1 child lol. I saw families of 4 often. To be fair the policy did end in 2016 and many of the children i taught were young and had younger siblings so its very possible that their siblings were born after the policy was changed BUT shit happens and lots of people had more than 1 child in China before the policy changed. Often the penalty was a fine. So if you made decent money or had savings you could just pay the fine. A lot of people simply didnt register their other children because they couldnt afford the fine which had become a big problem on its own. The children basically didnt exist to the government so they often couldnt get schooling, healthcare, and finding a job was difficult. Now that the policy has changed i believe these "invisible" children are allowed to be registered without a fine but yeah i was genuinely shocked too when i saw most chinese students i worked with were a household of 4. Im pretty sure thats why i ended up looking into it because i was surprised all my students had siblings lol.</TEXT>

Big brother really depends on the cast and the last few years they have had a terrible formula for picking houseguests but the challenge has the vets that still draw me in and I love the diversity of the show. Different cultures, different ages, different backgrounds, much more well rounded show for me personally.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Im a dance teacher. Nice improve. I like that song. If you were my student i would work with you on your supporting leg. You could pull up more when you do your turns and one legged moves. The knee is a little soft and this will effect your balance and strength in the move. It could be due to the shoes you are wearing. If they are runners those can be quite grippy and hard to move in but I think that would be something that could make some movement easier. Just practice always pulling up ( straightening) your supporting leg in turns and demi pointe movements.</TEXT>

No one thinks hes an all star but the production knew (or thought they knew) ppl wanted to see him again. They probably would have prefered to have a regular season and him to be just a come back player but since hes relevant now and it happened to go this way this year hes here for all stars.

    <TEXT>Most recently i was on 2 antidepressants and a sleep med. Wellbutrin, sertraline, and zopiclone. I stopped taking sertraline and actually felt better. I was having side effects i didnt even realize which can be an issue with taking so many meds. You start knowing whats causing what lol. Im also reducing my sleeping pill now as i have had some recovery of symptoms while being in a DBT program. So soon ill be down to just 1 med which is a little weird for me. I usually am on a minimum of 2 lol. Im thinking i may need to add some sort of antianxiety in there but i guess we'll see. Its hard to say if you are on too many pills. It's all up to you and what you feel you need for your symptoms. I personally listen to my gut when i think ive been prescribed too much or prescribed the wrong thing. Ive never gone wrong listening to that gut when it comes to medication. I always regret when i ignore it as it usually ends up leading to suffering. Doctors dont feel what you feel so if you feel you are on too many medications or feel you arent benefiting from one or feel there must be another medication that could replace 2 of them i would speak up for sure. If you have a feeling its too much then i think you should listen to that and discuss it with your doctor.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I wouldn't say its insulting. People have different experiences and something you may view as a little sad may be the most sadness theyve ever felt. I do think people over use the term depressed but you tend not to take it seriously when someone says " omg i dropped my hot dog im so depressed" or something dumb like that lol. I think the thing that gets to people with diagnosed mental illness the most is when people try to give you advice or relate their "depression" to yours. That's when it can feel condescending or frustrating and usually not helpful at all because there is a big difference between clinical depression/ mental illness and someone who has felt episodic depression but isn't actually chronically ill.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>1. You could just allow yourself to binge. Just accept that when you make cookies you know you are going to eat a lot and you are okay with that. Give yourself permission to enjoy them and to not feel guilty about it. Fact is if you are going to bake and binge you minus well allow yourself the freedom to do so, so you can at least enjoy the moment and reduce the risk of a rebound binge because you've made yourself upset about the cookie binge. Recovery doesnt start with an instant stop to binging. It starts with a change in perspective. A change in the way you treat yourself and a change in the way you attack the problem. Instead of shame and guilt bring kindness and be non-judgemental towards yourself. Being kinder is a big step. Eating a lot of cookies isnt the end of the world but youre right that doing this often and for a long time could hurt your health but recovery wont come if you beat yourself up everytime you eat something you think you shouldn't. When i started allowing myself to eat without shaming myself it actually became easier not to binge. As crazy as that sounds. 2. Again binge the cookies lol but perhaps make them with different ingredients so they are 1) healthier 2) less addicting. If they are for someone else make them a batch of regular ones and you a batch of the healthier version so you can still eat and enjoy but wont have as much consequence health wise for doing so. I also find typical cookies are much more addictive than healthier versions therefore i eat less.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Yeah im sure it feels that way and im not trying to dismiss your feelings but binge eating typically happens for a reason and often we can't see it because we aren't aware of it. I mean if you think back to when you started binge eating or to when it really became a problem or to when you started again, what was going on? People over eat sure but binge eating is often a loss of control due to having emotions we dont know how to cope with. Binge eating can definitely feel like the problem and can definitely cause or have an effect on depression but binge eating is usually a symptom of something. Its a coping tool just like drugs or drinking is for others. Yes many people are alcoholics and are depressed because they are alcoholics but something lead to their alcoholism. Theyre using alcohol as a coping mechanism because they cant effectively handle whatever it is that leads them to drinking. Food is the same to us as drugs are to a drug addicts. People who recover from addictions need mental health care to learn why they cope this way and how to avoid it. Unfortunetly we need food to survive so in a sense it can be even harder to find recovery because we cant straight up abstain from food. It takes a lot of mental skills to figure it out but I would bet that there is some emotion or something linked to the binge eating that you just havent quite figured out yet. I didnt realize either. I truly just thought i was fat and lazy. Even when they told me i had a disorder i still thought to myself nah i just have no will power but eventually i learned how to recognize what emotions i was feeling, name them, and eventually realized my binging was linked go my emotions but it wasnt an overnight realization.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I have been on Indeed for years and never had a problem with scammers. In the last week I've received 4 fake job offers. It's been incredibly hard to find a job during this pandemic. I am a hard working, very skilled worker, with lots of experience and scammers are trying to target me. Frankly I am not going to use Indeed anymore because they seem to have more scams than Craigslist at this point but I wanted to warn everyone to do their homework vigilantly before accepting any job offers from Indeed. You may be better off finding another job portal to use or apply with the company directly. Just wanted to warn everyone the scammers are out and they do cover their bases so its not as easy to spot as it once was.</TEXT>

I saw it says they will stop if you are no longer financially eligible but doesn't explain what amount of money that is? I am thinking about trying to work part time. I don't mind the reduction in money if i do i think thats fair but what if I make too much with the part time job, loose my benefits, and can't make ends meet because i am unable to work full time?

    <TEXT>I gotta say i really feel for men with BPD. First I know how difficult it is for women to get properly diagnosed with this disorder but for men I just can see how it would be extremely difficult getting a proper diagnoses. Ive been in quite a few BPD clinics now and it does seem the men have a particularly hard time with it. Not only are they often out numbered by women so I think that can add to a discomfort but since men do have a more difficult time opening up I can really see their struggle. Out off all the DBT programs ive done I think I saw one man complete the whole program the rest dropped out and it just hurt my soul to see that. I wish I was a braver person as I really wanted to talk to them and encourage them to stick it out but of course I just empathize from afar but I really do feel for you. This illness is a fucking bitch but I acknowledge how hard it must be for men. I can see how you could get very discouraged from seeking help. My advice would just be to try to stick it out. The more men that seek help and stick out treatment the more it will normalize it and hopefully we can get better treatment for men. Everything you said above us exactly how I feel almost to a T and I am a woman. Genders definitely experience things differently but with this disorder its very similar in both sexes. Hopefully you can find a program that can help you out because DBT programs have really helped me alot.</TEXT>

They make you an employee then say you have to set up your credit card on their online platform so you can pre-pay for supplies and then get reimbursed. Something like that. They also do identify theft by asking for copies of your IDs and SIN number etc. There is also a money laundering scam where they give you money and then you go deposit it into a bitcoin machine.

Most fans want people on there that earned their spot but to be fair i do not think bayleigh is an all star either. I think shes just done well staying in the reality tv world and staying relevant but is she really an all star?

    <TEXT>The problem is these are remote jobs. With the pandemic I am unable to work around people due to autoimmune problems. I know there are a lot of legit remote jobs right now but maybe even more fake ones. Since it's remote you don't actually end up going anywhere for an interview. The fake jobs are not hard to spot. If its a real remote job they should at the very least have a video interview with you which a lot of the scams will not do. Theyll often just review your resume and offer you a job which is why its so clear its bogus but some people have been doing telephone interviews and being offered jobs that were scams too. I'm more pissed off that im wasting my time applying for jobs and they end up being scams. I don't necessarily want to vet every job i apply to. I do that if they contact me but just to apply i dont want to have to constantly be researching if its legit but on indeed especially it seems thats what needs to be done which is why im just over indeed now.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I know me either! I duno if they have less staff that the scams are able to slip through easier or more scammers because ppl are looking for online work but for some reason there's a big issue now. I even saw an article about it on CBC a few days ago and the woman scammed found the job on indeed too. As to what ill start using now... The jobbank.gc.ca site is okay. It's a government website so more likely to be accurate. There's also monster and workopolis but i dont have much luck finding stuff in my field on those sites. I think I'm just going to start applying directly to companies i want to work with. Its tough though itll take more effort from me for sure lol. Indeed does offer so many options but when 4/10 jobs i applied for this week were fake its just such a waste of my time. I mean one job was for an actual company that exists. They put the businesses real website and the guys real telephone number but the guy didn't post the ad. I got an email from some random to give them my information so they could continue the hiring process. I mean so you could look into a company and it be completely real but its just a cover. Im just so over it. I just have no faith in Indeed anymore.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Well most of the scams ive run into are for remote work. That's what ive been applying for and that definitely is the easiest to fake so if you are looking for remote work have your guard up right away. If they offer you a job right away its fake lol. I found if they email you and ask you to send them your name,email, and phone number. Its fake too. Since Indeed hides your real e-mail and telephone number I assume that's why they ask so they don't have to communicate through indeed anymore. If they don't call you for a telephone interview fake. Some have been doing telephone interviews but most companies are going to want to do a video interview if they are serious about hiring you so if your hired after 1 phone call I would look more deeply into it. After all those obvious things its just a quick google search and you'll start noticing some suspicious stuff. Ill list the common stuff I see below: 1. The address of their company isnt on google maps. Meaning when you google their address and go to street view you'll find a strip mall, or house, or random building that clearly they do not work out of 2. If you call their number there isnt actually a human that answers the phone 3. Alot will have websites but they'll be pretty basic and will likely have grammatical or spelling errors. 4. If you google their company name and nothing comes up but 1 website. Also they do tend to register their business name so if you google their name and see their registration come up it's usually a very new business created within the last few months. 5. You cant find ANYONE that you've spoken with from this company on social media or any other sites. This one job i googled the "hr" person who listed the job, the "manager" who hired me, and their supposed president and got not 1 hit for any of these people. This particular scam went as far as to make fake LinkedIn profiles that had 2 or 3 separate ppl list this company as a current job but the linkedin profiles had no photo, no connections, and also they were ghosts on the internet. Some scammers really do go through some trouble lol. 6. If you still haven't figured if they are fake they will eventually ask you for something. Credit card, bank info, SIN number. Etc. At this point if you still have a suspicion but havent been able to prove it don't give them anything. Ask to speak with them because you have some questions. Typically they will stop responding if you show your are wary. If they do talk to you make sure to ask lots of questions to see if they are able to answer all of them confidently and maybe even request a video call. 7. Sometimes simply googling "company name + scam" will answer your question. They are popping up fast. Faster than i think ppl can keep up with but it could be a very easy way to rule them out. As for other websites for me ive been using the canadian job bank website more. Jobbank.gc.ca and looking on indeed to see what companies are hiring and applying directly to them instead of through indeed.</TEXT>

Makes me feel like they think im an easy target when I really dont think I am but now everytime I get an email about a job its almost certainly a scam and i rather be hearing nothing at all than feel like they think im a sucker lol . I also get my hopes up that someone is actually emailing for an interview and it sucks to constantly be let down. Its a real sucker punch to the self confidence.</TEXT>

Why do i have to be extra!? But then when they get the gift or see the party and have this genuine smile on their face and you can tell I made them feel special. It's addicting lol.

It is a really simple thing but you feel more connected to that person and frankly when you make someone feel good they usually want to return the favour so it could even help you down the road if you need something from them.

    <TEXT>Went in for a test this week. They couldn't get a good sample. I duno if it was the structure of my nose or what but they couldn't get it in past a certain point and said that the sample was possibly/likely not to be good. Instead of my results coming back inconclusive or something like that it came back as negative. Now i know that can't be trusted given the way my test went so still have to quarantine the remaining 14 days to be sure but the fact that the nurse knew it was a bad test, sent it off anyways and they still declared it as negative.... Makes me question these numbers. I mean i am assuming most people who do the test are able to do it as according to the nurse it was a small number of people who are unable to do the test properly but I still dont think they should have reported it that way then. What if i was one of those ppl that were just like cool negative and starting walking around like normal. And now that negative test is lumped in with those numbers even though its not accurate. I duno. Im sure im in the minority but still irks me.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I got a test done this week and they couldn't do it properly the way my nose canal was or something i duno. They sent it off anyways and it came back as negative but the nurse told me she probably didnt get a proper sample. So heres a test where they knew it wasnt completed and sent it off anyways and I got back a negative result. Well obviously its negative if you didn't get anything on it lol. So that negative is in that number and its 100% not accurate. Not sure if i have it or not but I am sure that wasnt an accurate test. Im not the only one either. She says some people just can't do it but they are still sending them off which i dont understand. These are accounting for possibly false negatives which is a lot more likely than false positives as the actual ability to get a proper sample has a lot to do with false negatives and a lot of people do struggle with this swab.</TEXT>

My point is they are sending off tests that they know have a high chance of resulting in a false negative and it's not getting labeled that way for the patients and not being represented properly in the numbers.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Its probably not the act of fasting but the removal or reduction in an inflammatory or triggering food you are eating. There is something to be said too about how fasting may effect insulin levels which can reduce your blood sugar and may have an effect on your skin due to its effect on hormones. I'm more inclined to say its the food thing and you probably have foods you are unaware of that are a trigger for you but the insulin argument is valid as well. I would explore the food option as its more sustainable to remove certain foods from your diet than to intermittently fast for the rest of your life but yeah these seem like 2 likely reasons.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Hey. Thanks for this. Yes, i am doing the 14 days as I only had symptoms for 2 days then I was fine. To be honest it was more likely allergies or a flare up of another condition I deal with but because some of the symptoms overlap with covid I wanted to be sure. Since I still can't be sure with this negative test I am going to continue to quarantine but I felt better day 2 and havent had any symptoms since that so I think I am okay as I imagine I would be feeling worse and not better but since covid can be sneaky I decided to be extra cautious and just do the 14 day quarantine but everyone I know thinks im being overly cautious lol but better safe than sorry.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Do people realize we can all pay tribute to the fallen without having a spectacle? Lets pay respect to the dead by causing more deaths? Pretty sure most people who lost their lives in 9/11 would rather their family stay home and stay safe than risk their lives to view some lights. Also to not risk the lives of the people that work on it. Its important to remember, but having the lights cancelled is not going to make us forget and everyone is very capable of paying tribute without it.</TEXT>

We are very capable of paying tribute and remembering without it and though its a tradition and sad we wont get it this year I think most ppl with their priorities straight will agree it's the right move for the safety of others.

    <TEXT>I didnt agree with the protests during covid and I am completely with the BLM movement. I thought it was too risky too but theres a difference between risking lives for a set of lights that aren't required to pay tribute and mourn. To a whole race in America feeling unsafe, unheard, and terrified for their lives. Sometimes you can't avoid these things in history. it comes to a head and if you want change you have to push for it when you feel the tide changing. The BLM movement had that momentum and its unfortunate it happened during a pandemic but ppl couldn't let that chance pass by. 9/11 lights will happen again and wont effect ppls ability to mourn. All it does right now is put ppl in unnecessary danger. The BLM movement didnt choose this moment for it to happen. It just happened organically and if your part of that community there was no way they were going to let that chance slip through their hands. It makes sense ppl were willing to sacrifice their lives to see a better world for future generations. A set of lights though tradition and of course important aren't necessary and will not effect the world as we know it unlike the BLM movement. Completely different situations. Not even comparable. Btw i also didn't cheer on cast members who protested. I think ppl doing things for clout is gross.</TEXT>

It's insane how many assholes there are out there that dont know how to follow the law or be courteous to their neighbour's. The amount of dogs that have been attacked by unleashed dogs is ridiculous. I dont even enjoy my walks with my dog anymore because I have to constantly be on alert for off leash dogs because she too is scared of off leash dogs coming at her. Its like im on body guard duty instead of a leisurely stroll. It's an extremely vulnerable position for any dog to be in and completely understandable if I dog stands its guard against a threat. Thats what these morons dont understand. "Oh my dogs friendly" .. Well mines not lol. Not with a strange dog charging at it. Its not all about you and your dog you idiot. My dog was attacked when she was on leash by and off leash dog too and believe she wont let that happen again. People just dont fucking get it. Its utter stupidity.</TEXT>

You are expecting ppl to follow the rules and it really ruins a lot of great places for dog people. There are so many strictly on leash trails and park's i cant go to anymore because ppl ignore the rules and its honestly really sad.

Where i live anyways pretty much everywhere requires a dog to be leashed unless in specifically off leash areas which are usually hiking trails. They are breaking the law if they are not on a leash. All dogs are different my dog is a rescue and is a sweet heart but sure as shit isnt when an unleashed dog is charging at her. of course she sees that as a threat. Your dog being friendly doesn't matter to my dog. She sees a strange dog she doesnt know running at her, getting in her face, shes going to have her guard up as are alot of dogs.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Its because ppl have no morals anymore so a generally shitty person can still be liked if they're funny or good looking or whatever. I don't have many friends left because my values are such that I cant respect these types of people and have a hard time hiding it. It sucks but in the world we live in now you kinda got to accept and ignore it or be prepared to have a very small social circle. I went to a destination wedding where almost all of my guy friends cheated on their girlfriends back home and are still all with them a year later, none of them the wiser. I haven't seen them since nor do I care too. Just instant turn off from who they are as human beings. One of my best friends since i was a kid was a pretty horrible person. Very self involved. She'd ditch me on a street in a foreign country if it meant she could go party with strangers. She also had no problem being a home wrecker. Often tried to get with guys that had girlfriends. I think it was a sick game to her. In fact two of the guys that cheated on their gfs at the wedding were with her lol. Anyways I had decided a while back that if I cut everyone out of my life that was a shitty person i would have no one left. So I kept her as a friend. And she did shitty thing after shitty thing to me but i pushed it off as just who she is and moved on. Well eventually her selfishness affected my life and frankly sent me on a spiral to rock bottom. She totally fucked me over and now I think back and wished I would have cut our friendship off sooner because she really provided nothing to me in my life. I guess you gotta outweigh the pros with the cons. Youve have to accept peoples faults but to a point. Once they cross the barrier of your moral code or your values then its not worth to keep them around. As for a coworkers unfortunately we have no option in that. Just got learn to live with it and just know that the people who do like his company and dont care about what a shitty person he is probably dont share your values and maybe their not your kind of person either.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Yeah sucks doesnt it. Maybe tell the rest of the male population that girls don't like to be groped every day of their lives and maybe you wont have to experience 1 groping every 5 years. No one should grope anyone. Period. So i dont think this was okay but its just always so ironic to me that men get so mad at shit they experience once when women live this type of shit everyday. And im sure you're not one of those guys but maybe now that you and your group of friends knows what that feels like you can pass the message along. Im honestly, not lying. I got touched every single time i went to a bar or club when I was younger. Whether it was a straight up ass grab or someone trying to be sly by brushing their hand across my ass I don't think I ever left a place not being violated. It happened so many times that eventually i just got used to walking through a crowd and ignoring my body being touched by unwanted men. I duno maybe it gives me some pleasure knowing that someone of the opposite sex finally knows what that feels like but being someone that it happened to constantly i can empathize and know it sucks and is fucking ridiculous. Im prepared to be downvoted by the masses of men that are going to loathe a womans perspective but maybe think about this the next time you see one of your buddies sexually harrassing a woman and thinking it's funny.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Thats such bullshit. Women get touched every fucking day and nothing happens to men. The one woman that was able to do something about it and you think you guys are the victims please. I got sexually assaulted everytime i went into a bar when i was younger and nobody gave a shit. If i said something i was a bitch or a prude. No one should assault anyone but dont go comparing your guys experience to women. Maybe you get one idiot that thinks its funny we have to deal with half your gender thinking its an appropriate way to hit in a woman.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I have a rescue as well and I see similar patterns in her. When you get a rescue you really are committing to a possible life of issues. You cant guarantee that the rescue is going to know all of their issues and their issues can change once they are rehomed. I mean its kind of what you sign up for when adopting a rescue thats why people that adopt rescues are so special. They are willing to do what they need to do and clearly you have. I too have put a lot of work into my rescue paid for training, dog walkers, day care, etc etc. But I do find new things pop up for her often. Ive had her 2 years now and shes overall better than she was but ill have the same experience where ill train her to do something shell be fine for a few months then all of a sudden its like the training went out the window or shes developed this new bad habit. I duno what it is. If its a rescue thing. Its just like shes consistent until shes not lol. It is very strange and ive had moments where I just break down because I feel like a shit owner and that she would probably be better off with someone else but the fact that we care enough to keep trying and keep researching and trying to keep accommodating well i think thats alot more than a lot of ppl would do and makes me think that I am indeed giving her a good home. I dont really have much advice for you because it seems like youre doing the same thing I am. You train, things get better, but then something else comes up and you have to train again or try to find a different solution. It's very similar to what I am experiencing as well and I dont really know if you can do much more about it but what you are doing. Changing up trainers and getting personal trainers may be beneficial as they may have different methods to try with your dog, but of course that gets expensive. The good thing is it will usually pass as you train but of course you have to go through the stress of it. My hope is as she continues to get older shell settle more and our bond will continue to grow. Ive had her 2 years and still feel like the bond is a work in progress. Rescue dogs can take a lot of time to trust. I will say I fenced in my yard when covid happened as we couldn't go to the dog parks anymore and i do think its helped her. We go out in the back yard everyday and play fetch. Even if only for 10 minutes it helps exert energy and gives her that time to roam the yard freely. I also have a long leash I use when we go to like a field or something where i know the place and she can also feel like she had a little more freedom. She used to be a street dog so i know she appreciates being able to explore a little more. I think just continue to follow your gut. If you think your dog needs something youre probably right. And just hang in there. It can be really difficult going through the hard times but I find those times are become fewer and farther apart as we progress and I think thats common to see.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Right so because you guys have sensitive private parts its worse to grope a man than a woman. Typical male response. Doesn't surprise me. "its not just sexual assault" . Wow. Yeah cause sexual assault isn't a big deal right. Who care if we get grabbed by the vagina or ass because it doesn't actually physically pain us so its worse for a guy. Do you see how you have a bias. You are downvoting because its a womans view because whether you know it or not you clearly have a bias that its worse for men than it is for women. Yeah guys get a little pain women can get years of psychological issues but "its JUST sexual assault" right? No big deal. God forbid someone touches a guys junk unwanted once in their life. So fucking typical truly.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I did acknowledge his. Multiple times. I said i empathized and no one should be groped. Frankly speaking though there are men that come on here all the time complaining about things that women endure everyday and I do get annoyed that their brothers rally around them and say its awful when I never see guys post so passionately about the exact same things that happen to women and like with this post when I point out that this happens on a regular bases for women I get vilified because no one wants to hear it from a woman but I don't really care tbh. I see an opportunity to shine a light on something that woman face as a norm in their everyday life and see an opportunity to speak to a male audience about how common it is for women and to maybe open up some eyes about the shit we have to deal with. If they can empathize with a man why not a woman. But you see that they don't want to. Some how instead of it being i agree no one should have to endure this it becomes "but its worse for us". I acknowledged i disagreed with it happening to anyone but I wont keep it to myself because I think its a perfect example of double standards and biases that exist and I like exposing it.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Yes they offer ppl a job without an interview. Indeed hides your email and phone number if you are applying with the indeed resume. If you upload your own resume they obviously they will have your information. Jobs will need your information eventually but if you received an email or message from a company with a basic " give us your name, number, email" its prob a scam. Most employers are going to be more professional than that and if they like your resume will set up an interview. Giving your email and phone isn't going to give them much to work off of so i wouldnt worry about that it's more of just an indication if someone contacts you like that its a scam. Usually if you google the business name if they've registered the name it will come up. When i searched all of the fake jobs it was like the 3rd or 4th result on google. It'll be like a state registration or provincial or national business registration something like that. Just click the link and it will tell you when it was incorporated. Most of them will be within the last few months. One that was harder to tell was one that was started in 2017. This was the one that did all the fake profiles n stuff. I did think maybe its just a start up as they did label themselves as a small company and posting on job searches geared to start up companies . i was skeptical but was thinking it could be real but when you really dig in theres just too many iffy things about it and ultimately even if they are a start up the lack of info online about the company or even the ppl involved is just too suspicious. I understand the frustration as indeed really is easy to use and has a lot of diversity with jobs. My only suggestion is if they do contact you for an interview or a job just do your homework before getting too involved with them. If you really like a position you see online you can also check out the company directly and apply through them instead just incase their using the company as a cover which I have run into as well.</TEXT>

Do they just choose with their dicks or something? Seriously though Analyse was a dummy, a bore, and part of a very problematic group in the bb house. She has terrible character. Of all the people on big brother that are athletic they choose a pretty bimbo who will go along with terrible behaviour if theirs a hot guy involved. Uggghh. This shows going to get cancelled if they don't stop bringing in terrible ppl. Edit. AND christie. She worse than Analyse! Dear god i dont even know if I can watch this season on principal alone. They are just terrible people. No moral compass what so ever. Not to mention so incredibly annoying. Be prepared for Christie to cry over everything. God i hope they are not on.

Theres a damn BLM movement happening and they cast 2 cast members that at worst took part in bullying and racism at best sat by and did nothing. This show is going get cancelled if they keep casting the worst of the worst. Out of all the possible big brother players of all the seasons they choose 2 from the scumiest group bb has ever seen. I actually cannot watch if they are on. They are really terrible ppl and you all will seriously not like them too I am sure of it.

    <DATE>2020-08-18 14:52:25</DATE>
    <TEXT>Last week I noticed a tender spot under my chin. Felt like a cyst or something. The next day the lymph nodes under my chin and jaw we're all swollen. Along with hot flashes, fatigue, headache, and just a feeling of general unwellness, like I was fighting off something. I did go do a covid test even though I have been quarantined since march but I went just in case. It was negative. The next day after I felt unwell I felt fine except the swollen lymphs were still there. It took about a week for them to go down but they did and im back to normal and feel fine now. The reason im wondering if this is linked to HS is because I ate a major trigger food that I shouldnt have. The feelings of getting sick are common with me if I eat this food but the nodes are new. I feel like it would be very weird if it were connected but I thought id asked since I have no idea what else could have caused it.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Just thought id give a little shoutout to this pizza that I tried the other day and was pleasantly surprised with. I tried the Margherita flavour. Its gluten free, dairy free, soy free, plant based. My triggers are dairy, sugar, and high fat so ive had to remove alot of tasty food from my diet like pizza but sometimes you just want a damn pizza! Lol. Anyways i thought id try this vegan pizza and see how it went for me. Well I'm happy to say it was great. It tasted great, was more filling than regular pizza, and I had no flare ups associated with it. Not even an IBS flare up! so this is my official go to pizza if I'm feeling like a bit of a treat. Just thought id share because i understand the struggle of not being able to eat anything yummy lol. Warning: it does have tomatoes so those of you with nightshade triggers this unfortunately may not be an option. It is also not a "healthy option" lol. Just want to put out there that it does have a lot of fat, sodium, and calories so its not a healthy alternative to pizza its just an alternative to pizza for those that have intolerances to dairy, or gluten.</TEXT>

Sorry, being Canadian I just find that insanely excessive not to mention dangerous...but anyways I agree with the pepper spray route. Someone also said once they carry an umbrella to shield her dog from off leash animals. I thought that was a clever route for non aggressive dogs. Of course requires you to always carry an umbrella but it could be enough to deter or de-escalate another dog in a safe way</TEXT>

    <TEXT>My dog has allergies to almost all proteins. i tried her on so many different foods it was hard to figure out. She had skin issues, ear infections, bowel issues and the vet also didn't take it very seriously. Allergies can cause so many issues but some doctors don't see it as a big deal. Anyways after a ton of different commerical foods and vet foods I finally found Raynes Low Fat Kangaroo food which sold through vets. It's more expensive but when your dog has issues that keep warranting vet visits its ALOT cheaper in the long run. Almost immediately her issues started to disappear. Now she has no signs of allergies at all. Her skin turned from purple and scabby to a healthy pink. She grew hair in places she was bald. She has almost no wax in her ears anymore. Her bowels are regular and normal. Her coat is very thick, full, and soft. Even her nose looks better lol. It was like magic. Im so happy i found this food. They have treats as well.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Someone has a vendetta against firefighters lmao. Firefighters literally risk their life anytime they are called to a fire. They are also first responders for accidents, medical, etc. The solution is not to take from an important service to give to another important service. These are all important services. There is money else where that doesn't need to be pulled from essential services. I think its appropriate for firefighters who risk their lives to be paid appropriately. I don't even agree with volunteer firefighters. I mean talk about taking advantage of people. Its one of a few occupations that you willingly risk your life. I think good pay is fair. It takes a toll on the person physically and mentally not to mention on their family as well. Absolutely fair to have a good pay.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>First of all its going to be the hardest time EVER to get a dog from a shelter because SOOOO many people are adopting because they have more time due to covid. So it's like the worst time to try to adopt. I mean for the first time ever shelters had no dogs. Its unheard of! Thats what you're up against for local shelters. There are international rescues that are great, where i got my dog from, because even before covid rescuing locally was hard but since flights are reduced and borders are closed thats not a quick option either. I know when you decide to get a dog you want one now but its honestly best to wait. Keep applying and looking at different areas but know that its probably going to be difficult until covid is done. There are ALOT of puppy mills and shitty breeders popping up taking advantage of this lack of availability. If you really are a person that wants to rescue i wouldnt add to the problem. I know its hard but If you wait it will be easier and you can get a legitimate rescue that needs your help and a good home. Shelters are going to start dealing with ppl bringing back animals. It always happens when these mass adoptions happen. So keep trying but keep your expectations low that as it could be a while before you get a dog. You may also want to sign up with different places for foster care. That will allow you to have a chance with the dogs when they first come in and usually you'll have first pick if you want to keep them.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Ugh this is why i adopted internationally from a rescue charity. Local shelters are insane with their standards. I appreciate them making the effort to place in a good home but theyve become impossible to please. I provide my dog with an AMAZING home and lifestyle. Like its legit the best for my dog i spare no cost but according to local shelters I didnt have what it took to adopt a dog. Fulltime worker, single, lived in an apartment, first time dog owner. No one wanted to give me a dog lol even though I was already prepared to pay for training, i had a dog walker and daycare in place for lunch time walks and play, and I lived 5 minutes away from 3 different dog parks. When I reached out to a rescue that worked internationally they were very excited with everything I had in place and saw that what I was offering was better than what the dogs current situation was. I mean isn't that what matters. Like you said they get a wonderful home. Instead they prefer to keep them in a cage. It really makes no sense to me and i hear this ALL the time about local shelters.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Texting in general for ppl with BPD is not ideal lol. Unfortunately that's how everyone wants to communicate these days. I would say there may be some changes you could make to help reduce your distress. Talk to him about not doing that. Tell him you understand it may mean hes just busy but it would be really helpful for you if he messaged you back right away or perhaps doesnt read it until he has the time to msg you back so you dont start worrying. Dont blame him just say its something you need for you. Dont message on a system that you can see read or not. Maybe stick to regular text message or if you can turn off that setting. I have an android so if i text regularly i cant see if its been read or not. Agree to just communicate through phone calls. Its not an easy option as many people dont like doing that anymore but hes your bf so maybe hell be down with knowing the best way to communicate with you is phone call. DBT interpersonal skills have some good ways to get you through situations like this.</TEXT>

It is a little bit ridiculous lol. Shes perfectly fine alone but I just feel immense guilt lol. Especially since covid we havent been apart for more than 2 hours lol. I also have a camera that ive set up to check in on her. It helps and doesnt lol. I probably check it too much but does feel good just seeing her chilling being fine lol. Maybe an option for you.

    <TEXT>DBT absolutely made the difference between me just surviving and me getting my life back. Medication brings me to a point where I stay alive but DBT teaches me how to deal with this world and gave me the skills needed to thrive in this world. I think remission needs to be a perfect mixture of meds, therapy, and life circumstances but DBT is truly vital in BPD because the disorder is really based around emotional dysregulation and DBT is the only therapy that addresses that. Its a program specifically made for BPD and you can tell it is because it really speaks to a lot of issues we deal with on a day to day. Ive done the dbt program twice so it doesnt mean its going to cure you but especially this last round really helped put my symptoms into remission I have been on a lot of meds. Wellbutrin has been the one that has lasted the longest for me with the least amount of side effects.</TEXT>

I feel a lot better knowing someone else with HS has experienced this and its not as far fetched as i thought lol. Thats insane though.

I often wonder if ive got something else going on but my symptoms never quite match all the tell tale signs so I figure its prob just the HS. I too do better eating clean. The reason I think I had this flare up was because I ate 2 chocolate type desserts. Things I havent eaten in over 7 months. I expected to have a flare up but not like this. Not in a part of the body that really isnt effected by HS and not so severely. This was certainly new for me and is kinda freaking me out that HS can effect my whole system so greatly but it is what it is. Guess i really cant eat chocolate anymore  #128557;</TEXT>

I was thinking about going to the doctor because i really thought it was an infection of some sort but with covid i figured ill wait a few days and if its still here ill go but day by day it felt better. It still took a week to finally go down but yeah im perfectly fine now. I would say other than a pain reliever try to help your body by eating cleaner. Less inflammatory foods will help to not cause any worse inflammation and just lots of liquids and sleep. Kind of just the normal stuff you do when you are sick because really thats what it is. Your body acts like its fighting off something so it goes all nuts with inflammation lol. Ive heard bra pads or shoulder pads can be really nice to put under your arm for cushion. I havent tried it but ive read some ppl do that. Ice will also help with swelling and pain.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>No problem! There are some things you can do to help relieve symptoms like shampooing with an antifungal/antibacterial shampoo. They are good for skin conditions. Vets usually sell them or you can look on amazon for one. You can also buy a hotspot foam or an anti itch spray. Those will help relieve some inflammation and dryness that can cause itching. Her paws may have a yeast issue. Thats what commonly causes licking and redness. You can use the shampoo for this or i know there are some at home remedies like a vinegar mix you have them step into. Something you can research. All of these things though are just helping the symptoms not getting to the cause of the problem. I would definitely try a dietary change as food allergies are very common now and often linked to skin issues. Goodluck!</TEXT>

Skin went from purple to light pink, hair grew back, coat was fuller and softer, it was really a transformation all from a diet change. I ended up changing her to Kangaroo but sometimes even a change to fish ,duck, or deer will do it but those didnt work for my dog. Still too commerical i guess lol so I finally landed on Raynes low fat kangaroo which is sold through vets. It was like a miracle food. Even the specific allergy foods didnt work as well as this food does. So now shes kangaroo all the way. Even eats kangaroo treats.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Taking photos lol and I know that seems ridiculous as everyone takes photos but in highschool i was always the person with the camera, on every trip I was the person with the camera, some of my friends only pictures on social media were from me and my picture taking lol. I loved taking photos because i have a terrible memory and taking photos really helps me to remember the moment. Well then all of a sudden social media blew up and everyone is taking photos of everything. Where photos were once beautiful snap shots of a vacation they've now turned into posed, strategic photo ops. The camera used to be a tool I used to capture spontaneous moments, and beautiful sights I wanted to remember. It was a tool to enhance your experience. To bring those moments home with you. Now the camera IS the experience. Now everyone takes photos of fucking everything and nothing is spontaneous. Most people spend their trips just trying to get the perfect picture instead of enjoying their trip and getting the perfect picture because it was a snap shot of that trip. Its kind of ruined picture taking for me. Where i was once excited to be the photog and provide my friends and family with nice pictures I am actually put off my photo taking. It's turned into this narcissistic tool instead of the intended purpose which is supposed to be memories. Everyone's lives revolve around photos now for all the wrong reasons. I feel like I can't be that way anymore because I just look like the rest of the zombies taking photos for social media when in fact I was doing it before it was cool lol.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Thats probably why last season was the worst season ever. Like please stop casting influencers. If a normal person comes into the house and becomes an influencer after that's one thing. They are taking advantage of the fame and that's just good business. If someone comes into the house as an influencer already its not about the game. Its about getting more followers. Its about their bottom line, period. Its not about this life changing money, or being a show of the fan, its all for more attention, more followers, more money. Which causes personalities like Holly who are terrified of showing anything real AND people with generally terrible personalities because their first career in life is to smile and look pretty. Get back to casting real fucking people. Guess what there are hot people in the world that apply all the time and have real world experience. So sick of this garbage influencer shit.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I think the problem with influencers is they're basically the same type of person. Anyone who is an influencer as a full time career has at least mild narcissism. Their whole business revolves around taking photos of themselves and having their fans sing their praises. Its all the issues that cause singers and movies stars to get huge egos without any of the actual talent. So you've got a pretty face, who has tons of adoring fans, who makes money strictly from photos of themselves. I mean it doesnt exactly do much for personal development and though not every "regular" job is superior it certainly allows you to build qualities that are important for a non superficial world. These types of qualities, skills, and education are what made big brother interesting. People from different walks of life trying to navigate and outwit others. Now you have everyone from the exact same walk of life. You have a few "outcasts" which basically means normal people now lol and then everyone else is an influencer. It adds to the terrible personalities we are seeing in the last few seasons.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I think theres two things possible things going on here. 1. Absolutely an American diet can contribute to these inflammatory diseases. American foods are extremely packed with fat, sodium, sugar, chemicals, hormones. More so than most even developed countries in the world. This definitely leads to increased issues as we see with the diabetic and heart diseases epidemic we have here. Considering that many people with HS have found certain foods as triggers really proves how food can be a link to inflammatory symptoms. 2. People in Sri Lanka aren't reporting their symptoms or are being misdiagnosed. HS up until a few years ago was considered a rare disease. Mostly due to it going unreported because people are embarrassed about their symptoms and location of symptoms AND doctors were misdiagnosing the issue as just regular body acne or regular boils. Only in the past 5-10 years id say has this really come to light and more and more people are coming forward with symptoms and doctors are starting to become familiar with it. I mean they weren't even really studying or researching it when I started to learn about it. It was very much in its infancy here and is just starting to become a more known problem as the internet has helped people to connect with others like them and has allowed people to research diseases for themselves. I think its very likely that somewhere like Sri Lanka is still dealing with it going under the radar. If people don't come forward with their symptoms doctor's aren't aware of the condition and it goes undiagnosed. It is also possible that they simply have less cases because the diet isnt as processed. It could be a combination of the two. Its hard to say for sure.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>10 officers, all being paid, to arrest 1 girl, for an unpaid ticket. Yeah I think the police are doing just fine allocating their funding lol. I understand this is probably a whole day sting and they get a few people coming in but there are at least 10 officers in that room. The people are coming in 1 at a time for non violent offences. I really doubt 10+ police officers are required to take down 1 person. Waste of money.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Im not roping her into anything. People were talking about how Tyler had a regular IG and then became an influencer after BB and i was saying it probably had alot to do with angela as well because its easy enough for her to get him connections and teach him the ropes. She was already big on insta. Its not far fetched to assume she helped him build his partnerships considering they do a lot of them together.</TEXT>

Its entirely possible for someone to bring up people and you to not talk shit or say the wrong thing. I mean thats on you if your saying shit that gets you in trouble. Why is it up to janelle to know you cant handle a conversation lol. "They bring up people i dont like" . Like again lol.. Sooo... Is she not an adult? She can't take having a conversation about someone she doesn't like? Shes expecting people to read her mind. Like they should know i dont want to talk about this or these people. Shes able to vocalize it to others, if she really doesn't like the conversation then say that. Just say your uncomfortable or you rather not. Like i mean seriously? I can see why ppl are annoyed because even if janelle is doing it on purpose, like nicole f thinks, she is more than capable of saying I dont feel like talking about it or whatever lmao. She acts like shes a helpless child.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>If they follow the standard DBT program its usually 1 group class a week thats about 2.5 hrs and a 1hr one on one session with a therapist. A DBT program is usually 6 months or longer. You spend about 4 weeks in each module. There are 4 modules I believe. With a new module usually comes new people. So youll have some people you see every week and some that may be new or are preparing to graduate. In my classes there typically isn't more than 8 in a group. You usually have 2 therapists leading the group through the lessons for the week. The class is very skilled based. Typically you'll start off with a Mindfulness exercise, then youll take up the homework for the week, and then you'll get into the lesson. The homework is based on the lesson you learned that week. It may mean implementing what you learned into everyday life and discussing how you did or filling out a worksheet from the book. The one on one will be more personal. You'll get to talk more about specific issues that are bothering you and they will help you navigate which skills would be helpful for those issues. Its very eye opening especially if you've never done DBT before. Its honestly just good skills to know for life in general. I think everyone should learn DBT skills regardless of if they are mentally ill lol but its especially eye opening for us because it really validates our thoughts and feelings and helps us to navigate our lives more effectively.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Clearly feeders have had a strong reaction to Nicole F and Janelle mainly that Nicole F is obsessed with Janelle and that hate has spread around the house. The show edited it like Janelle threw the first knife when the feeders have been saying Nicole F targeted Janelle outta no where. Not to mention the Nicole F edit was very nice. We didnt see any of her shit talking or crying. In fact it made her look like the victim. As someone who is getting most of my info from the TV broadcast it seems its not being portrayed accurately. Do you guys agree that Nicole F is being shown as a victim when she in fact is not?</TEXT>

After they had to erase a whole player from this last season due to insensitive comments during the BLM movement they are bringing on 2 players that at best accepted racism at worst contributed to it. So yeah, they should have been cancelled last year yet here theyll be again on our TV screens. Ridiculous. Update: Christie has been dropped from The Challenge. Let's hope Analyse is next.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Especially depending on the cheese. Cheddar and mozzarella are absolute no's for me anymore but I can eat goats cheese and feta cheese with no issue. I can also have yogurt with no issue but straight up milk or ice cream is a no. Doesn't mean you'll have to cut out everything because I think you have to balance your goal with it being sustainable because its only going to help if you can sustain it so in my opinion I did just a few things at a time so I knew exactly what the culprit was. So if you think cheese is your issue maybe just cut out the main cheese you eat or the heavier cheeses first. That may be enough to get rid of the acne and you'll have less to cut out. Mind you it can take longer to figure out the trigger food this way but it can allow you to keep foods in your diet that you don't necessarily need to give up.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Well shes a controversial casting choice considering her season on BB was filled with racism issues with which she was close to the people that were being racist AND was accused of being discriminatory herself. MTV has had alot of bad press lately with other cast members from their shows getting "canceled" during the BLM movement so theyve been on damage control the last few months. My assumption is that they didn't do their homework or simply didnt care about Christie's involvement in her seasons controversies but probably second guessed their decision once news got out she would be on and people started complaining. They dont need to cast anymore people that have had issues with racism. But no one knows for sure why she was cut. For all we know she tested positive for corona and was cut. I dont know for sure because analyse wasnt cut and she was part of that group in BB as well.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Pumpkin is really great for both constipation and diarrhea. Just helps digestion in general. My dog used to have this issues and pumpkin would help. So much so ive made it a regular item in her diet. I would try a teaspoon with her food see if it helps ( pure pureed pumpkin. Not pie filling pumpkin) . Oh and pumpkin will help with glands as well. It bulks up the poop. You can also get glandex which is a product sold for expressing glands. Its mostly made of pumpkin You may also want to look at her food. She could have allergies. My dog was allergic to certain proteins and she would never have a regular bowel. Always constipated or had diarrhea and has issues with glands too. I switched her food to a kangaroo diet and almost immediately her bowels became regular and all her other issues got better. I use Raynes low fat kangaroo. Its sold by vets. If it is allergies chicken is the most likely protein the dog is allergic to and chicken may be making it worse. I was advised the same thing and i didnt realize it was making it worse. Maybe try to change to a novel protein. Deer, fish, bison, duck, rabbit, kangaroo, are ones you can try. Chicken and beef are common for allergies. Unfortunetly my dog didn't agree with any commercial protein so i had to go with kangaroo. Allergies are common among dogs now, don't know if its likely to happen to such a young dog but thought id mention it since my dog had the same issues. Def go to vet though. With a puppy is could be a common problem im not sure as I never cared for a pup but keep food in the back of your mind because I find alot of vets don't acknowledge allergies as an issues very much. Out of like 6-8 vets my dog saw only one mentioned allergies to me.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I dont think its rude but with any behaviour you have to monitor whether the dogs are enjoying themselves or if its becoming a problem. Ive seen dogs that love to run up and down the fence with each other and i dont see an issue with it but if your dog is just barking and the other dog seems worked up or stress then yeah id call my dog back. To be honest the way you explain it sounds like the guy may have been annoyed at his own dogs. Perhaps he wasnt happy with their behaviour. Maybe it wasnt actually directed towards your dog. I wasnt there though i dont know but if both dogs seemed relaxed I really dont see an issue with letting them interact through a fence.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I have heard this as well from a lot of trainers. Ultimately its your call. I still like to socialize my dog but I go when the park is very quite and we'll see maybe 1 or 2 dogs there. I find when shes had no interactions with dogs shes more reactive to them on walks but that's my personal experience. From what ive been told most adult dogs just need good exercise and the dog park can cause more issues than its worth. Add on top of that your fear of an attack and a higher possibility of an attack from a pitbull OR another dog. I would say it would benefit you to go elsewhere, visit at a quieter time, or simply change what you do to exercise your dog.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Pitbulls absolutely are more likely to attack TO KILL than other breeds and ignoring that fact is the reason there are so many attacks. If you own a weapon you need to know how to handle it properly and people are getting pitbulls without knowing anything about them and not acknowledging the FACT many of them have a high prey drive. It takes very specific training to safely own a pitbull and the best owners are those that acknowledge the increased risk and handle it accordingly.</TEXT>

Its really irresponsible to underestimate this breed and does a disservice to them and to other dogs that may become a victim because of an ignorant owner.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>It makes sense that this argument got out of hand because if she also has BPD she definitely felt attacked. To be honest neither of you were being skillful in this moment. DBT is meant to help you. Not to help the other person. In this situation it doesnt matter whos right or whos wrong. The situation escalated and once it escalates no one is being skillful. If your going by DBT skills you would have removed yourself from the situation to help you. Not to help her. You remove yourself so you dont say anything you dont want to and you dont get into a worse situation. Your not removing yourself for her your removing yourself for you. You are the only person you can control so you should focus on that. For this specific situation there are skills in interpersonal effectiveness that would have made this conversation more effect. Saying something sternly and saying things like ive told you 100 times will sound attacking to alot of people. Your placing the blame on someone instead of trying to resolve the issues with communication. In the interpersonal effectiveness chapter there is a script you can use for situations where you want someone to do something. Its the DEARMAN skill. This should be done at a time when both of you are in a neutral state. This script will help you form your thoughts in such a way that you will ask instead of demand something from someone. It will allow you two to talk about the situation and come to a resolution without anyone feeling like they were right or wrong because it really doesn't matter. What matters the goal. That the door gets shut. You also have to be open to compromise and to accepting that they may not do what you want. I would strongly suggest looking up this skill. This is the appropriate skill to use for this situation.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>You are not going to get the response you want if you have a "you vs her" outlook on it.  #8203;  gt;Shes always the one to yell. Well that's her issue, isn't it? She obviously doesn't have the skills necessary to approach things in a skillful manner. So you can either continue to blame her and nothing get accomplished but a ruined relationship or you can anticipate that she is sensitive, doesn't have the skills to keep her temper in check, and approach it in a different manner. Which if you know DBT as well as you say you do would be the DEARMAN approach.  #8203;  gt;She clearly has an anger problem (I dont. I have more of a sad response, in private). Everyone experiences BPD differently. Hers is anger and to attack. Yours may be sadness and to retreat. They are both symptoms of BPD and neither is better than another its just different. A little empathy could go along way here. You are both struggling with intense emotions. I know it feels like "you're doing all the work" but that's what DBT is. It's skills you use to make the situation better. You can't change anyone's behavior or outlook but your own. If you show some compassion perhaps she would respond to that vs feeling attacked.  #8203;  gt;So my thing is why should I always be the one to leave the room when she yells?  #8203; You don't have to leave the room if she yells. There are plenty of ways to deescalate a situation without leaving the room but one option is to step away because once people start yelling at each other its no longer an effective situation and there is no point to it. You don't have to walk off like your "running scared". You could simply say something like " We are obviously both getting upset about this conversation maybe we should come back to it when we both cool down a bit". Again, it's to serve you not her. Did you like the way you felt after having that argument with her? I don't think you did considering you came on reddit to talk about it. Maybe if you had taken a different approach you would have felt better about the interaction. Thats the point of using DBT skills, its so at the end of the day you can feel good about the way you acted regardless of how the other person decides to act.  #8203;  gt;She should be doing her own DBT and leaving the area when she feels upset.  #8203; You can't control how others act. You can only control yourself. Whether she is acting in a way you would doesn't matter because it's not in your control. It would be nice if everyone thought the way we thought but it just doesn't happen like that. You don't know what kind of vulnerabilities shes bringing into this conversation so who's to say how she should react to it. If you have the control to be able to leave a situation then that's what you should focus on because at the end of the day that's all you can do. You can shoulda, woulda, coulda, her all you want but it will never change the fact that you can't control what she does regardless of if its right or wrong.  #8203;  gt;That was my point that I cant be the one to run away everytime she yells.  #8203; It's not running away. Its removing yourself from a situation that isn't serving YOU anymore. Like I said above. You don't have to "runaway" you could simply point out the obvious. "This conversation isn't effective right now because we are both upset and I think we should pick it up later". That's DBT. You want to be skillful. That's what being skillful is.  #8203;  gt;Because that just reinforces the idea that I'm wrong when I'm not wrong or right I just want the door shut  #8203; It doesn't reinforce anything. It just tells her you see the conversation isn't working right now and you want to pick it up later. Its pretty straight forward and even if she takes it as "Ha, she's wrong" who cares. That's her thought that's not fact and when you do come back to the conversation at another time when you both are able to effectively talk, You will be able to explain what you want and she will actually be able to hear you. You are making an assumption that shes going to think because you left you are wrong but that's your assumption. You don't know that's what she's thinking and leaving an escalating situation never means you are wrong. It means you have the ability to see when a conversation is no longer effective and do what needs to be done to get it back on track. Again this is DBT.  #8203;  gt;No blame, no tricks and no bs. Just shut the freaking door  #8203; Yes, This conversation is possible but there is a lot of factors that contribute to someone's interpretation of what you are saying. Tone, body language, use of words, etc., If you came with a "Stern" tone, an aggressive body language, and blaming words of course shes going to get defensive. Instead of making it a conversation you made it an order and I am sure she feels just as "right" to have the door open as you do to have the door closed. She obviously has her reasons and she feels she is not being heard. This has nothing to do with whether your request was valid or not but when having a conversation like this with someone it does pay to listen to what they have to say, to ask rather than demand, and be willing to find a compromise if possible. You know you are dealing with someone with BPD and have done DBT so you are aware of how these things can make a big difference in how a conversation is interpreted. I understand the frustration of feeling like you have to do all the work but that is life, unfortunately. We can't control others and if we want to live this life a little more peacefully it is up to us to do the work and be skillful. Being skillful doesn't mean you are wrong. Being skillful allows you to live a better life. It benefits you. You should want to be skillful to make your life easier.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>This is the problem. Condoning lethal force no matter the circumstance. That's ridiculous. The guy was non violent, non threatening. They had multiple opportunities to take him down before even reaching the car. Even at the car he still could have taken him down. He could have tasered him, his buddies could have helped tackle him. SO many things to do before resort to shooting a guy in the back gang style. With no provocation whatsoever. If this police officer really saw this as his only option than the whole department should be shut down because they clearly aren't trained what so ever and are a menace to society. Just because you are a policeman doesn't give you absolute authority over anyone and certainly doesnt give you the right to murder someone just because they disobey you. He walked away and that may be a death sentence. The shit my friends and I have said or done to cops in the past and faced absolutely no consequence is insane when I realize if your black simply walking away is a death sentence.

Hes not smart, or athletic, or strategic, he just seems actually clueless. Even more so than regular rookies lol. If he stays in the game its going to be because Tyler carried him through so basically he made a smart move aligning with Tyler but everyone wants to align with Tyler hes just lucky Tyler wants to align with him.

    <TEXT>I think it depends of course. Canadians are known as big beer drinkers but I think that's been shifting a bit. I think the most popular types of beers here are pale lagers. Either the massed produced canadian or american brands like Molson, Coors, Budweiser, etc. In the last few years we've seen a spike in local/craft beers. People like the idea of supporting local beer and have been shifting to more British Columbia, Alberta and Ontario Beers. Ciders have also become very popular in the last few years. International ciders like strongbow are popular but like beers more and more locals ciders are popping up and becoming prefered. Wine has definitely become a staple especially for women but even men. I feel like if people are "partying" they'll stick to a white wine but lots of people have a glass of wine for any social event really, even a glass after work lol. I don't see preferences for brands of wines to be honest. Not with my age group anyways which is 25-35. I think with wine it mostly comes down to price and preference. As for liquor id say its probably pretty similar as with the USA. Most popular liquors here are vodka, rum, and rye (whisky).</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I used to serve beer at the rogers arena in Vancouver for hockey games. I would say the most common was Coors, Canadian, and Budweiser as they are the cheapest. Beer at hockey games go for like $18 bucks a pop. Its ridiculous really. Other commons ones were Heineken for premium and Rickards does well too. Shocktop was a new one we had on tap and and it did quite well during the season. For coolers we do a lot of mikes hard lemonade and for ciders we do alot of the okanagan ciders and batch 1904. Wine at hockey games certainly isn't as popular as its more expensive and isn't really a hockey game type of drink. Hard liquors aren't as popular either purely because they are too expensive at games. The beer stands are always the busiest. It depends what arena your at though. Most arenas have contracts with companies so you may only be able to get molson products, etc. But yeah for most canadians at a hockey game is comes down to affordability and a standard draft beer is going to give you more bang for your buck.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Premium in Canada usually refers to international beers that are higher in price. Premium can also refer to beers that have high alcohol content. Heineken, Stella Artois, Guinness are common premium beers. People may be more inclined to get a premium beer when at dinner but I find the average canadian wont opt for premium if they are at an event or going to a party as its not as cost effective. Some people may call craft beer premium as the price is higher but alot of places will make the distinction of domestic, premium, and craft beer. "Cheap" beer is domestic and consists of the major brand beers.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>No. This area is known as the triangle of death for a good reason. There are alot if blood vessels in this area that lead to the eyes and brain. If you pop one and it gets infected you could get a serious infection that could lead to blindness, even death. There was a case not that long ago of a girl who popped a pimple on her face and it immediately started swelling. Turned out to be cellulitis and she was at risk of going blind. Not worth it. I would make sure you cleanse morning and night and use salicylic acid on your face to help dry out the spots and help them heal. Also use a lightweight oil free free moisturizer like complex 15 to help moisturize the skin so the salicylic acid doesn't strip.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Look up hidradenitis suppurativa. It's a condition that seems like acne at first but its actually more like boils. It typically starts off as "butt acne" when you are younger and can progress to worse outbreaks. Its an inflammatory condition that is typically genetic. I have this condition and was told I had body acne for years until I finally found a dermatologist that told me about HS. It has nothing to do with sweating, or dirt, etc. It's essentially an autoimmune disorder. Starts off usually on the bum,thighs,and groin but can progress to under the breasts, armpits, and stomach. A lot of people find relieve with diet changes as many foods are inflammatory and can worsen the the condition. Smoking and weight gain can also worsen the condition. Usually shows up around puberty but may not show up till early 20's. If this is the case you probably have stage 1. There are hidradentitis subreddits that have a lot of information if you think this condition fits the bill. There really is no cure except some topicals and trying to find your triggers. Obviously I cant see what your spots look like but with puss and the area thats affected its possible this is what you are actually experiencing. HS was once considered a rare disease but with more people using the internet and more doctors becoming aware they are realising its more common then they thought. If it is simply acne a body wash with salicylic acid or an antifungal like tea tree could help. I would also change to a scent free laundry detergent in case you have a sensitivity. Try to wear cotton clothing and underwear to let the area breathe and moisture wicking fabric when working out.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Yeah I mean for me it's kind of standard bad food Unfortunately lol. I cant eat ANYTHING fried for starters. So completely avoid that. For sugar again its stuff with very high sugar so milk chocolate, pastries, cakes, etc. And for dairy its high lactose stuff so milk,ice cream, cheddar cheese, mozzarella cheese. These are the major things I had to cut out Then it gets kind of complicated lol because it seems in moderation I can eat other fatty things like butter or sauces but give me too fatty of a steak and i break out. So I basically just have to limit the higher fat foods. I buy all lean meat now to help reduce. Same for sugar. I can eat dark chocolate without much issue but if i eat too much or eat it a few days in a row my skins done. For sugary stuff i basically cant eat anything commercially. The milk chocolate kills me. I tend to do better if I buy dark chocolate stuff from the health food section. Other then that I have tried not to cut too many things out of my diet because I want it to be sustainable. So I still eat fruits, and whole wheat bread/pastas and my acne has still reduced greatly. I would say its 90% gone at this point. in order to get to 100% I may have to start looking at removing wheat but im not ready to do that yet lol because im still seeing improvement. I do keep to only whole wheat/grain items and when i can buy brown rice pastas which seem to do better with my digestion and have less sugars. So basically removing the really inflammatory foods and keep the others in moderation.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Bha or ahas toners are good for texture. I had an isssued with textured skin for so long and these didnt work for me though. The only product that worked and made my face feel like a baby again was Herbivores Blue Tansy mask. Its sold at sephora and is stupid expensive but it was honestly like magic. It was on for 20 minutes and i had new skin. Something to invest in if you are really getting frustrated. Ive done dermaplaning at home as well which did help with some texture but the blue tansy really gave me a fresh start again.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Alot of the time simpler is better. I would def add a moisturizer and a mineral SPF. AM -Cerave Cleasner -Toner- optional (niacinamide is good for acne prone skin, or vit C oil is good for acne scarring and skin inflammation) -Moisturizer -SPF PM -Cerave cleanser -Epiduo -Moisturizer. Hyaluronic acid would typically go before your moisturizer as it pulls moisture. However if the epiduo is a gel this may affect the order in which you should use it. I would check with your derm or simply get a moisturizer that contains Hyaluronic acid. If you want to help your acne get a mineral sunscreen specifically for acne prone skin. Ppl with acne avoid sunscreen due to fear it will clog pores but sun damage inflames acne, dries out skin which causes your skin to produce more oil, not to mention it causes wrinkles. As long as you do a good cleanse at the end of the day an SPF will do more good than harm. Same as moisturizers. Dry skin will produce more oil and by not using a moisturizer you could be inadvertently causing your skin to produce more. Even if your skin is oily it needs hydration. The ones ive found best for acne is complex 15 (sold on amazon) extremely lightweight very good for day wear. First aid beauty ultra repair cream ( sold at sephora). Thicker formula but does not clog pores. Great for night time. There is a guy called Hyram on youtube. His videos are very educational and ive learned alot from him. Theres also a dermatologist called Dr. Dray that has good insight as well as Cassandra Bankson. Hyram and Cassandra both had acne and are skin car specialists.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Totally get it. I actually thought i would never get rid of my texture because nothing worked i just figured I did the damage and now its permanent lol. I literally jumped for joy after using the blue tansy mask i just couldn't believe the difference it made i hadnt felt my skin feel like that in years. It really worked for me, obviously its not a guarantee but based on others ratings and experience it sounds like others have similar experiences. I definitely think it was worth the money and you use surprisingly little so it lasts longer than it seems it will.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Oh man me too! I love fried foods i am so extreamly sad i cant eat anything fried anymore. I cant even have fries. I had to bake them at home now lol but fried foods made the BIGGEST difference in my skin. My skin started to get better just a few weeks after i stopped eating it. When I tested to see if I could maybe eat it in moderation after giving it up my skin absolutely exploded and I realized i can never eat fried foods again. It is sad. I miss fried chicken, jalapeno poppers, french fries lol but I dont miss what it was doing to my skin. I got really painful cystic acne too so i was in chronic pain. I just had to switch to making foods at home. Make my own fries or even mccain fries are baked not fried. Ill made breaded chicken at home so i can bake it and yeah just pretty much bread and bake things if im craving something fried lol. I only eat baked chips. Its not the same but its doable and im alot happier without it in my life tbh</TEXT>

You dont need to eat better you need to eat with control and that comes by figuring out why you cant control binges which 9/10 psychological. An eating disorder program or therapist that specializes in DBT or CBT therapy would be much more useful for you. A dietician is a better option after you've sorted thr binge eating.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>There is kind of 2 ways i did it. First was to take out common triggers 1 at a time for 2-3 weeks and monitor if I see any difference. Dairy, high fat foods, and high sugar foods are most common. Maybe start with the one in your diet that you think may be most problematic. For me it was high fat food. After a few weeks i notice it did make a difference but was still getting some flares so I moved to high sugar foods. That helps as well and then I moved on to high dairy foods as i was still having some issues. Once I had been a few months with little flares I started introducing things here and there and really see what was a major trigger and what could be eaten in moderation. Now that i have major triggers worked out i record everything I eat to catch the ones i haven't been able to. Its a process. I started oct 2019. My HS went from level 3 to 1, cystic acne is almost all gone, IBS is much better, and acid reflux is rare but even 10 months later i still get issues here and there where i dont know what caused it which is why writing down everything is giving me a much clearer picture but I think a good place is to pick 1 major inflammatory food first because the thing is its not going to help if your diet becomes unsustainable. If yoy remove everything with fat,sugar, and dairy. Your down to salads everyday lol. Its important to find a balance so my goal was to try to reduce as little as possible so i can stick to it.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>General practitioners aren't great with psychological issues. Its not their specialty. They tend to see things in very general terms so you'll likey get general treatment like an antidepressant, appetite suppressant, or just a diet plan. What you need is a psychological assessment by a psychiatrist so they can assess the eating disorder properly and any other issues you may be dealing with. Through the psychiatrist you be referred into specialized programs that will actual address the binge eating not just the symptoms. Now I am not in the UK i am in Canada but if your system is similar to ours i would find a hospital or clinic that has eating disorder programs and request specifically to your doctor that you want to get sent for an assessment to that center. Most places you do need a doctors referral so a lot of the time you'll have to be very straight forward with your request as to what you want from your doctor. I would even go online print out the referral form and bring it to my doctor so all they had to do was sign and send lol. Not every doctor will do what you want and will try to give you general treatment but you need to keep pushing for this specialized treatment because it's really what works.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Like everyone else said food testing isnt accurate. My dog had bad allergies to almost all protein. She went on that Hills diet as well and it did reduce alot of her symptoms but I too was not a fan of the nutritional value and she still didn't seem 100%. Finally i went with my gut and changed her to Raynes Low Fat Kangaroo Dry food and it was like night and day. Within a few weeks all of her allergy symptoms were gone. She looked brighter and healthier than ever. Bowels normalized, skin cleared up, hair grew back, she was softer, thicker. It was fantastic. She been on it now over a year and we've had no issues. Other than the price lol. It is vet exclusive here and has a had a lot of increases in price because of the Australia wildfires BUT the monthly bill for the food is still far less than the constant vet visits for her allergy symptoms and im happy to see her not having to go through all the symptoms anymore.</TEXT>

She clearly does not want to be a villain and I dont think its fair to hate her because of that.

No one should pay more than $350 for a TELF certification if they are planning abroad teaching or remote teaching. The ones in canada are a straight up rip off. Your better off with an online program which many are accredited as well. The only way a TELF or TESOL course through a university or other overly priced place like oxford education would be a benefit is if you have a bachelors degree and are planning to work domestically with esl students or are trying to work for government run schools in other countries. If youre looking just to do remote teaching or teaching in countries with less qualifications like south America its a waste of money. An online cert is really all you need.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Yeup. Ive been in recovery 10 months and still have digestive issues. I think it can take a really long time for your gut to balance itself out again. Theres a lot of damage being done there while in the binge /restrict cycle. Things ive found that help is reducing inflammatory foods. Dairy, high sugar content, and high fat foods are worst for me. These are very inflammatory to the system and can increase problems. Since we have binge eating disorder we need to be careful not to restrict for the wrong reasons. Ive found when I am removing foods from my diet for health reasons I have no urges to binge. Its only when the focus is on weightloss/self image that restricting leads to binging. In order to ensure your successful I would do it slowly to see what some of your triggers for symptoms are. Pick 1 of the most inflammatory foods in your diet and remove it for a few weeks. Monitor symptoms. If they improve you know its probably is link. If its improved a little you know you may need to remove something else. If it doesn't do anything move on to something new. Once I found my triggers I do find if I eat them i have a WAY bigger reaction than i did before. Whether its because im just not used to it anymore or removing it makes me more sensitive you have to be aware that if a food is a trigger youll have to keep it out of your diet for a while. Your gut needs quite a long time to heal. Drink lots of water as it helps with digestion. Exercise helps with digestion as well. Even a 20 minute walk a day will help massage the intestine. Try to eat a balance diet with lots of vitamins and fibre. Try to stay away from white processed foods. Whole wheat/grains are good for digestion. Almost everything comes in whole wheat options now. Try to stay seated upright 1-2 hours after eating. Lying down could have an effect on the acid in your stomach. Writing down what you eat and your symptoms can help you see patterns. Again be careful with this because it could trigger your eating disorder but I find if I only write the food and symptoms and not calorie etc it doesnt trigger me as much. Tums can help alot if you feel indigestion starting. Take a tums to reduce that acid. If you find your taking tums everyday for weeks you should go visit a doctor. You may need something more powerful to help your stomach recover. It sounds like IBS to me which can improve but a change in diet may be required to reduced trigger foods.</TEXT>

I myself don't seem to have issues but Ive seen alot of people say tomatoes are a real trigger for them. So dairy and tomato sauce sounds like an inflammatory nightmare lol. Since you already have a feeling dairy is an issue id start there. Once its been removed for a bit you can better asses whether its the dairy or tomatoes that cause issues. Ill also say not all dairy is the same. Milk, creme,heavier cheese like mozzarella and cheddar seem to be much more inflammatory than things like yogurt, goats cheese, feta cheese. I say this because again i dont think you necessarily need to remove it all maybe just remove the higher fat, higher lactose items. See if that makes a difference before you completely wipe out dairy. Just a suggestion as I can still eat thing with dairy just not the heavier stuff.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>BED isnt really an issue of cravings. Its an issue of coping. Especially if you have MDD you likely just dont have effective coping strategies so you use food. BED is 9/10 times a psychological issue so though meds may help therapy/ED programs are whats going to address the root problem. Once youve address those issues you'll notice craving reducing because you have skills to properly cope. You may not realize you use food to cope but maybe you should start paying attention to what you feel when you binge. Most success stories you see on here start with a change in perspective or therapy. BED is a mental illness and should be treated as such. I strongly recommend finding a program or therapist that works with ED or in CBT or DBT therapy. This will address why you binge so you can get control of it. Cravings are a symptom of binge eating disorder. It doesnt cure you of it.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I picked up a hitchhiker in Alberta. It was on a long steep road up to a popular tourist site. It was day light, busy, and i knew it was a 20 min drive but a very long, hard, walk. I spent alot of years backpacking and though I never hitchhiked he looked like a typical backpacker to me. I remembered what it was like trekking around with a heavy backpack just to get to a beautiful view and wanted to help the guy out . I figured theres only one road up and down, its busy enough, and there wasn't really anywhere he could safely murder me lol so I picked him up. I think that's the only way i would do it again. If it was like 99% chance I don't think i can get murdered lol.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Im on wellbutrin. Never tried vyvanse but have been on many other meds along with wellbutrin. Im on 300 as well and i feel like wellbutrin doesnt have many interactions. Its quite tolerable in my opinion. I think vyvanse itself can be a tricker drug to take. It has alot of side effects but I personally dont think an interaction will be an issue. Your doctor should be doing blood work regularly anyways so that should be an indicator if anything physically is changing but as for side effects i think the vyvanse will be the cause of it rather than an interaction issue</TEXT>

    <TEXT>This is so dangerous lol. Which you obviously know but for those of you who are going to try this there is always a chance it could lead to an accident. Burns being the most obvious. If you burn the flare its more likely to get infected and HS can cause staph and sepsis easily which can be deadly. Then theres the chance you may just burn yourself in general. Also wrapping stuff around an iron is a fire hazard. It could burn, melt, etc. If heat is something that you think will help I think there are safer options. Damp cloth with hot water, hot water bottle, a heating mat, heated blanket, hot/cold pack, hot bean bag compress, general warm compresses. I would try these before jumping to a 400 #176; iron. It's not a very smart idea. Sorry to say. I think its dangerous to suggest it before trying other things that create heat safely.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Yeah this sub is getting pretty ridiculous tbh. I get liking Janelle. Trust me shes one of my favourites but the endless hate for anyone who is not Janelle is exhausting and is getting tired. I dont like nicole or dani for talking shit and I hate nicoles victim complex but janelle isnt innocent at this point either. She has said some uncalled things about Nicole now too. Though i do think Nicole started something unnecessarily I think its fair to say the house is getting to both of them a bit and we should have some understanding about the situation. Its one thing to find nicole a bad player or even kind of a shitty person but to straight out hate her for being a brat is a little much. As for Tyler its really ridiculous for anyone to be hating on him lol. He made an alliance early that didnt include kaysar and janelle and though it would have been awesome for them to work together hes in a good spot and taking them off the block would totally screw his trust with his Alliance. Jaysar were big targets coming in and unfortunately this is what happens with big targets. Ppl gun to get them out. Tyler is smart and knows the whole house wants them gone so he should appease them. ALSO they are massive players so at the end of the day it only helps his game to get them out. Thats how the chips fell he really as no other option unless he wants to screw his great standing with the house. It sucks to see people you like and who are general good players get booted but you cant control the house and truth be told they should have tried go form alliances early but i think their fate was sealed because they were huge targets coming in which i think made ppl not want to align with them. They playing all scared not all stars lol.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Yes I do. I have done the full DBT program twice. The first time it helped for a while but I ended up in a pretty bad place again after about 6 months. This last time It pulled me out if depression completely and im basically in remission. Depending on your life circumstances, life stressors, who your therapists are, etc I think it can have different outcomes BUT even if it may not cure you youll learn very valuable lessons and get some insight into why you do the things you do which is very validating and can help change your perspective on a lot of things. It really is a necessary treatment for BPD. Its so specific to us you just cant get that from regular therapy or medication. There are a lot of skills required to help reduce symptoms and dbt will teach you those. I am very lucky i live in canada so it was free for me both times. It may be worth it to see if there are any programs that are covered by your government or perhaps insurance. Any grants or other programs available maybe for low income individuals. I think its worth it but I dont know if I could afford that much either. I think its worth it to have a good research and make sure you exhaust the free options first but if this is the only option its a good investment for the future. I really don't know how someone with BPD finds long term recovery without DBT. Thats just my opinion.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Absolutely but as a health care professional ive seen many people trying to "hack" this kind of stuff and they end up in our clinic or the hospital. The main point here is heat helped. So I offered plenty of safer options to produce heat than to potentially make a bad situation worse by causing another injury, fire, or infection. People read this and are looking for anything that will bring them relief and they are not thinking about the potential consequences of using a dangerous item on your skin like an iron. Trust me. If someone ends up at the hospital because they burned themselves with a curling iron trying to burst a boil on their breast your going to get the same response at emerg. Why didnt you just use a hot compress? And you are going to regret it because not only are you hurt but youre embarrassed. Im glad she sorted it for herself but there were safer ways and i certainly dont condone spreading a potentially dangerous method of doing it to other people suffering and desperate enough to try it.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>It was interesting to me how the first big alliance formed was all white ppl lol. I truely dont think its a racist thing this season at all. I think it's just so in our face right now that its hard not to notice that most of the white ppl gravitated towards each other and of course now are targeting "the other side" that is almost all minorities. I think this just shows how ingrained it is in america. They don't even realize it themselves which is really telling. Because these are solid ppl i respect them and dont think it was done on purpose but it is hard not to see that separation that seems to happen unconsciously. It's sad really.

I think they are used to working with other white people though and feel comfortable with white ppl but I do think it speaks to the deep rooted racism in the usa because i live in canada and watch bb canada and you dont see this same divide and its because our culture is more inclusive than the US.

We just all sat there in silence while she listened in clear terror. We we're kind of confused at first. It was so weird for a teacher to act like that. We started to understand that something bad was happening but didnt quite understand the severity of it as clearly our teacher did. I think most of us were a little scared, worried, but mostly confused. When we got home and the videos of the towers were on the news thats when it sunk in what we were really listening to. It was a serious moment in history. Ill never forget it because Ill never forget how human my teacher seemed at that moment. As a child I found it terrifying to see an adult so terrified.</TEXT>

    <DATE>2020-08-28 02:24:08</DATE>
    <TEXT>I was really thinking that there would be a battle back but the fact that Julie told Janelle about all the alliances and who voted for her etc etc makes me think there might not be. I feel like if there was a battle back they would want to keep them unaware of whats going on in the game? Is it just me? Or has Julie spilled the beans before and a houseguest has come back with info they wouldn't have known had they not gotten kicked out?</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Yeah but I thought it could start with her and be the next 3 that get evicted. Does it necessarily have to be the first ones? I mean she did have a point about production saying she doesn't go home till september. Mind you I guess it would be pretty obvious if Janelle didn't show up on social media. We'd obv know shes part of a battle back. Hmm yeah i guess. Seems likely now there will not be. Thats a shame.</TEXT>

Like I'm not a huge fan of this whole Nicole bashing trend going on BUT I find it ridiculous she thinks her wedding is like the event of the century that its such a big deal if she uninvites her lol. Like how highly do you think of yourself? Most of the times weddings are a hassel for ppl to go to anyways especially ones out of town or s STATE. Shes probably happy to not feel obligated to go anymore IF she even was going to go lol.</TEXT>

Why not have a battle back with stronger players but I get it, its not going to happen but I didnt think it was out of the realm of possibility which is why when Julie revealed all that info I ask the sub if that confirms it for sure.

    <TEXT>Ive had a fever and flu symptoms just from a bad HS flare. Those symptoms are just what you feel when your immune system is fighting something and with really bad flare ups it can cause an overactive response, because of covid I would just monitor your symptoms but if its a 1 day thing its likely that. The other week i straight up thought I had covid because my lympnodes actually swelled and I felt like i was coming down with something. Only lasted one day but to be safe i got a test. It was negative and I ended up realizing it was due to a flare up because I ate something i shouldnt have. It really is insane what this can do to your body not just your skin. I have seen many posts on here about ppl getting fevers due to flares too.</TEXT>

David is so egotistical hes giving advice to players who have played 3-4 times when hes played 1 day and hasnt even watched a whole season. He thinks hes there because hes smart and sees "intricate patterns" like they made him go through an IQ test to cast him. Hes there because they felt bad for him and hoped he could be redeemed. He is incredibly annoying to watch. It's one thing to be clueless its another thing to have an unwarranted ego when being clueless lol. I think the fan response to him got to his head because i am baffled why he thinks hes so great.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I am canadian and this is legit. I went to a hockey game in Tampa and this wasnt a special military day or anything. The first 20 minutes was pure military fanfare. It was SO alarming to me how they spent a hockey game of all things basically as a huge propaganda machine for the army. I think its great that you guys appreciate the people who have served and give them special mentions but it was eye opening why so many people in the states have this hard on for the army. If i was a kid and saw how special I could be being in the army Id think it was an awesome job too. Fact is thats not the reality for most in the army. Its not all praise, awards, fanfare. Theres a lot of sacrifices that they don't mention to you when touting how great it was. It really is a well oiled machine down there. I was also really surprised to see recruiting stations all over. In malls, schools, etc. Its crazy. You are so bombarded with it its no wonder so many young people make it a consideration early on. The american army has the best propaganda ive seen anywhere. It really was a sight to see.</TEXT>

I feel bad when the BB fans go ravenous on a player but he disrespected everyone who genuinely loves this game by putting absolutely no effort in what so ever. The amount of ppl who would have loved to be in his spot all disrespected by this rookie who gave no effort. He has such an ego, or is so lazy, he couldn't even be bothered to learn the rules. Sorry David but you put yourself in this spot. If you had shown the slightest bit of respect for the game I dont think ppl would be so hard on you.

    <TEXT>Yeah it might be cute but its cutting into your sleep and your sleep is important. I would try a dog bed in your room as well like others have said. If that doesn't work i would ignore her. If the pattern is consistently just that she wants to go on the couch then you know she doesnt have to pee so you shouldn't even get outta bed anymore when she barks. When she barks tell her no and tell her to go to bed or to go lie down. This is why is good to have a dog bed that is her bed. Its good to have a place you can tell her to go so she gets the cue to stop what shes doing and go to her space. Seriously though it may be cute now but it wont be cute if you have something important the next day and shes waking you out of important sleep to make you sleep on a couch where you'll be less rested. Everytime you oblige her your reinforcing the behaviour and she'll keep going/ it may lead to more demanding behaviour in the future. I think letting some things fly because your not super strict is fine but its not appropriate for a dog to be waking you out of your sleep. Sleep is the most important thing for us to function. In this case you need to put yourself first. Edit. Sorry i see now this is posted as fluff. Thought it was an advice piece. Feel free to ignore my advice, to each their own if your fine with it.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I agree that it would be beneficial to have a program that is specifically targeted for ODSP. Like the summer jobs program for students but there may be options you haven't looked into. ODSP does have employment supports. Your worker can set you up with a community counsellor that can help you find work, keep work, or help you increase your skills. This is probably your best option as its specifically for ppl on ODSP. I am currently working with an ODSP approved provider for career counselling and its helping me to figure out what i want to do / what I need to do to do it. Youre young so there are still a lot of options for you to expand your skills. If you have disability there are options for grants and bursaries to cover costs of courses/programs if that's what you feel you need. These programs can really help you get on track to a better future. If you have tried that the YMCA also has a program that pays employers the training costs associated with a new hire. Which means employers have an incentive to hire from YMCA. The YMCA provides all kinds of employment services. They can help you set up your resume, they have workshops, will help you apply for jobs that are included in that program. Through the YMCA you may not have as much competition and employers are looking to benefit from the money they offer. There are usually other local programs that work with employers too to help aid ppl in finding work. I know where I live there is a program through our municipal government that also offers incentives to employers and will help connect you with those employers.

    <TEXT>You should seek mental health care. You are obviously depressed and using binge eating as a form of self harm. I did this too. I got proper mental health care and have found recovery but even though im better ive done permanent damage to my body by trying to use food to kill myself. You have the chance for a life with recovery but it will be a tough one if you go through this for too long. You need to be your own advocate. Find help. Its what can get you through this. 1. Mental health assessment - Get proper diagnoses 2. With a proper diagnoses you are able to get into proper programs 2. Program/ therapy based around DBT, CBT, or eating disorder specific is best.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>When you have an eating disorder restriction feeds it. I know loosing weight is crucial for your health but you'll never loose weight long term if you have an active eating disorder because diets feed the eating disorder and make it worse. You need to put the diet aside for now and focus on your mental health. You need therapy or a program. CBT, DBT, or ED specific therapy is best. When you get control of the root of the eating disorder everything will fall into place. Ive lost 75 pounds since November without diet or exercise. I did it by working on my mental health and getting my binge eating under control. I only got my binge eating under control by working on my mental health and figuring out the connection. You are not in the same category of people who just need will power to loose weight. No, you need mental health help and its astonishing that these bariatric doctors still cant see an eating disorder when its slapping them in the face. Ive been there. I know the struggle. I promise you the diet is doing more harm than good and you need to push to see a real mental health professional.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I was misdiagnosed as bipolar 1 and 2 lol. I finally got a proper diagnoses of BPD. Not saying thats your case but in regards to the eating disorder the BPD treatment helped WAY more than anything I got when they thought I was bipolar. Bipolar therapy usually focuses around CBT therapy IF your therapist uses a program based therapy at all. BPD uses DBT. DBT has helped immensely with not just my disorder but my ED. DBT focuses on coping skills. BED really comes down to a lack of coping skills. I would suggest you talk to your therapist about this. Either ask if an ED specific program is available or if she is familiar with DBT skills and could walk you through some. Theres also lots of websites and books/workbooks on it. I think theyve even started developing ED programs with DBT because its so successful but nothing worked for me until I did this program.</TEXT>

I dont think hell have great endurance for a lot of stuff but will do well with anything that requires brute force. Mark wont be good at politicing. He was pretty shit in big brother. Similar to Fessy. But hes a nice guy. May already have some big brother alias in the house.

    <TEXT>Wow this girl threw shade. "Josh Martinez (Big Brother) - #160;4th season and 0 elimination wins" Picture of josh crying lol. She also threw shade at kyle which I wasn't a fan if tho lol. "Kyle Christie (Geordie Shore)- #160;6th season to flop #160;in a row" And put a photo up of when he was having a medical procedure looks like hair plugs or something. I dont understand the hate with kyle. Hes made it to 2 finals. He came in 2nd last year. People may not think he did that with athleticism but he did it. Hes accomplished more than a lot of men and women have on this show and I dont know why he gets dragged for it. He beat Cory and Fessy. 2 ppl that are thought of as good competitors. Regardless if "cory stopped" it means kyle had the heart and endurance to keep going when cory didnt. Hes also actually entertaining unlike most cast members now. I dont find macho men and catty women entertaining. Hes just a funny guy with a personality. Its refreshing to have him on the show and I think UNLIKE josh he really doesnt deserve the hate he gets. How is he a flop?</TEXT>

    <TEXT>It's commonly known to start at age 11+ but that's because puberty is more likely to start at 11+. I started puberty at 9 years old so it's not out of the realm of possibility. The area in which its happening and the look of the flare/the scars it leaves are the most identifiable thing about the condition. You'll get a better idea if you look it up.

    <TEXT>Ive been doing quite well with BPD lately. After hitting rock bottom i moved back home and started an intensive BPD program. The combination of the program, not working, and not having a lot of bills to keep up with allowed me to focus soley on my mental health and it worked. I finished the whole program and while doing the last assessment my symptoms had gone down so much they weren't even readable as bpd anymore. I knew it wouldn't stay like that forever but am so surprised how easy it is to come back. I've been doing nothing for the last 10 months but doing mental health programs. The last 2 weeks have been busier. I got a few interviews for jobs, started training for a volunteer position, and have been taking some career workshops. 3 things that dont even take up my whole day and i am overwhelmed already. My irritability is coming back, im feeling sad, and I just had my first episode of feeling out of control in a long time. It just really feeds into my belief that Ill never be able to handle anything and this cycle will go on and on. I hate this fucking illness. I really do. And question my ability to live a "normal" life. Even though I dont want to I am going to finish this vent off with giving myself credit because i know thats what im supposed to do if im being "skillful" lol 1. I was able to acknowledge that my emotions we're getting hot and removed myself from others to go to my room 2. I was able to identify what I was feeling. Sad/Scared 3. I was able to list off the thoughts that were causing these feelings ; i get overwhelmed too easy, the pattern is starting again, ill never be normal, I'm going to become mean again, I'm letting my dog down ( havent taken her on big walks this week), Im going to be stuck like this forever. 4. I have been able to calm myself down enough to be able to write this and stop crying and After this i am going to go for a walk with my dog. I think i need to come back to this feeling of sadness later to sit with it a bit more but overall an episode that may have lasted days in the past lasted maybe 15-20 minutes this time. Thanks for listening. Just venting but maybe someone will relate lol.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Personally I found AIP diet way too restrictive. I get thats the point but its not going to help if its not sustainable. After trying AIP and failing because I started to have an aversion to meat i took the opposite approach lol. Instead of removing everything inflammatory and then adding it back in slowly. I removed 1 inflammatory item at a time and watched for symptom relief. They both take a long time but at least my method didn't make me hate my life lol. I looked at the most inflammatory kinds of foods in my diet. Sugar, fat, dairy and decided which one was most prevalent . I started with high fat foods and decided to cut them out for a few weeks. I did notice a reduction so I continued and added high sugar foods for a few weeks. That also helped a lot so i kept that going a few months after that I slowly tried to see what i could reintroduce and what i couldnt. My HS reduced but i was still had some flares so i removed high dairy food as well. I went like that for a few months. By 8 months i figured out what diary, fat, and sugar foods i could tolerate and couldn't. My HS reduced from stage 3 to 1. Ill get an odd one here and there so now I write down every food i eat to try to figure out what other foods may be a trigger it that haven't realized but I am FAR better off now than i was and typically dont experience anything too bad unless i eat something i know i shouldnt. I just found this was a more sustainable way to do it and the easiest to way to ease myself in. Even though AIP and all that is for our health its still part of this diet culture where we really see it as all or nothing. I think that way of eating can be detrimental to our mental health AND our gut health so that's why i decided to take a more gradual approach. Alot of ppl don't get far enough through AIP to really understand what their triggers are. AIP could take 3 months to over a year. Its a long long commitment and ppl put in alot of hours to ultimately "fail" . I think its important to try to minimize the amount of food you are removing from your diet so you can eat a moderate balanced diet which is what will be required for longterm success. This is of course my opinion.</TEXT>

I cant remember the exact protocol but I do remember people often having to go back to their odsp office to get approval for the glasses and then bringing us back forms. People often were dissapointed with what they could actually get covered by odsp it usually wasnt a lot. Most people couldn't get frames they liked they had to get the least expensive frames and just kind of deal with what those were. The doctor has to send the info to odsp. If they told you they accept odsp they've done it many times b4 and shouldnt be an issue.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>A diet will never be the answer to recovery. Doesn't matter what the diet is. Diets = increase in symptoms. Ive lost 75 pounds in 10 months and i did it by STOPPING dieting, and stopping trying to loose weight. Its not bullshit. There is a reason so many ppl on here talk about not restricting. You will loose weight naturally when you stop dieting and focus on your mental health instead. Recovery from BED will bring better weight loss results then any diet you could ever try. Because recovering from BED can be long term, sustainable weight loss. Not just a short term fix. Sorry to say but keto will do nothing but continue the cycle. BED is a mental illness for a reason. Its a psychological issue that manifests as food binging. It's not actually about the type of food you eat. It has nothing to do with will power, or carbs, or calories. It has everything to do with figuring out why you are binging, associating emotions to the binge urges, learning coping skills for those emotions, and combating self image issues. Food is just a tool we use to cope with all these things we don't have proper skills for/understanding of.</TEXT>

I think its bullshit that both destination weddings I've been to cost ME 1500-2500 for someone elses wedding while they get their room free AND wedding discounted because their guests pay. NOT TO MENTION the added cost of a wedding shower gift, bachelorette party, and wedding gift... BUT .... this isn't new. Nicole is not being inordinately cheap as ALOT of people do this now. However, i do think its in especially poor taste when you are a reality star and have influencer money. I think we should make this a thing of the past, period. Why am I going into debt for your wedding? People need to realize its incredibly selfish and if they cant afford a big wedding without having their guests pay for it they shouldn't have one.</TEXT>

They are doing it for the savings. Their family and friends feel obligated to pay thousands of dollars and the wedding couple gets more discounts the more ppl come. The last wedding i went to they had so many ppl come their room was completely free and got their wedding package discounted. I was told she was going to give us some of that extra money to help with our costs but I didn't see a penny. Instead it went to rent an animal for photo ops. I was the maid of honor. With the amount I spent on her bridal shower, bachelorette, bridesmaids dress, flights and resort fee. I truely think i ended up spending more on her wedding than she did. Hear it now ppl. Destination weddings are fucking selfish. It is not " a vacation" for me. I don't spend $2000 to lie around on a chair for a week. I could travel for 3 months in a foreign country actually experiencing the country for $2000 dollars. People need to stop this destination wedding shit. If you cant afford a wedding don't have one.

    <TEXT>It was pretty standard stuff. Anything fried, milk, cream, heavy cheeses, milk chocolate/high sugar desserts. Those were the easy, obvious, ones. I'm still figuring out the ones that don't fit the trends. Like it seems like I have issues with apples, maybe oats, certain oils. Those are more difficult which is why I suggest starting out with general high inflammatory food. Getting those outta the way and then trying to narrow it down I find has been easier. Nightshade vegetables are a big one with HS. I dont seem to have an issue except maybe tomatoes but I still haven't been able to quite prove it.</TEXT>

If he stays he has 4 years without fear of reelection and he'll prob cause an international war. So fucked up. I feel so bad for most of the ppl in the US. Its a terrifying time. It feels like someone went back in time, messed up, and caused a butterfly effect for this to happen.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Its not about controlling the desire to eat its about learning to cope with the feelings that give you that desire to eat. You are using food as a coping mechanism because you don't have coping skills for sadness, anger, etc. Eating disorders are psychological. Learn how to identify your emotions and how to effectively deal with them and your binging urges will naturally decrease and you will be able to find recovery. Shift the focus from food intake to improving mental health. That's the way to recovery. Therapy, especially CBT, DBT, or ED specific. If you cant afford or cant get it covered there are a lot of resources available online. Websites, books, workbooks, podcasts, youtube etc. Your just looking at from the wrong angle. Food isnt the issue. Your mental health is. The first thing i did was put the desire to stop binging and to start loosing weight away and changed the focus to mental health because focusing on the food is going to keep you in this cycle.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>It could also be the reason he credits angela with his game. He seems to have a lot of anxieties. Maybe angela in his season really helped him reel that in so without her he's having difficulty navigating. I always wondered why he gave so much credit to her for his win but maybe we are seeing why. I feel bad for tyler but i empathize with him. If your a caring person. Empathetic like he seems to be it can be really hard to play a game based around manipulation and he clearly cares about the state of the world right now. He clearly sees the unspoken divide in the house and he doesn't want to be a part of it but he can't stop it. I think everything is very genuine. Im sad that bayleigh keeps questioning him. Hes so clearly genuine but they are happy to let him self evict. I dont think that the solution i think they should align. One of them could prob get further with tyler as an ally then 2 of them. Where they still only have each other.</TEXT>

This season MOST players have kids and partners that they miss. They've already played the game so the novelty has worn off. Alot of them dont NEED the money as they are all relatively successful from their bb fame or other business endeavors and the state of the nation is crazy right now. Corona, blm, politics.

If your on disability im sure it's easier to get approved but i got approved simply with my doctor filling out my form and my history. This will be the first year i am going on odsp and my disability tax is actually set for renewal cause its been 10 years. When you are approved for disability tax you are able to start the rdsp. Just to clarify. You are eligible for RDSP when you get approved for the disability tax credit. This is federal and does not require ODSP. They will determine your eligibility when you send in the disability tax forms but you DO need to be approved for the disability tax credit in order to open an RDSP. So your steps will be to apply for disability tax credit. Once approved. You can go to a bank and open an rdsp</TEXT>

The best thing you can do for yourself right now is be kinder to yourself. This harsh criticism and judgement you have of yourself is actually exasperating your symptoms. If you can break this shame cycle its a good first step. Think about if your friend came to you with this issue. Would you tell them they're disgusting and a big fat truck? I doubt it... Think about what you would say to a friend and say that to yourself because thats what you need. To need to tell yourself it's okay. Your dealing with an eating disorder and you are doing your best. Don't beat yourself up for eating just say it's okay and try to move forward. Give yourself props for trying to find help. Thats not easy to do and its not easy to avocate for yourself and find a new therapist. You are doing what you need to do and you need to give that process time. Treat yourself like you would a friend. Be kind, be comforting, be validating, because you may think bullying yourself will kick your ass into gear but its doing the opposite.</TEXT>

Okay. I mean... Hes been on their side the whole time. He was clearly having a rough time. Hes coming to them pouring his heart out and theyre cool with everything. I think he prob realized why am i sacrificing my game for ppl who dont give a fuk about me. I think he wanted to leave but i think he was genuine about his intention to use it as a way to get them further. I do think he cares about their cause. Hes the ONLY one in the all white alliance that has been legitimately trying to work with any POC in the house. I think its ridiculous for bay or day to be mad at him for that. He gave them a chance, it was christmas choice. He would have left had she put him up.

I think this gave him perspective on the situation and he decided that he was done trying to help her. He would have gone if christmas used the veto but i dont think he felt he owned anything to bay anymore. He tried to get it to work and it didn't.

He was 100% genuine in that situation but production talked to him. Told him he couldn't campaign against himself. Then christmas told him she didnt want him to leave. I think after speaking with christmas and production he decided to just let whatever happen. It was christmas choice not to use the POV. Tyler and her have a final 2. She thinks they'll go far and she thinks bay will come after her if she stays. If christmas had put him up he would have gone gladly. People blowing this up are ridiculous. Just because he didn't end up leaving doesnt mean he was weaponizing BLM and it was some tactic. He made genuine comments about wanting to help them go far because they are there for a bigger purpose and he knows that but now everyone is up in arms because hes not on the block.

She really dug her own grave with that. In saying that of course bayleigh is taking it too personally. She takes everything too personally. I am pretty sure everyone who has watched bayleigh knew it's only been smooth sailing because she wasnt on the block. This was an expected reaction from bayleigh which probably wouldnt be much different regardless of who put her up. At the end of the day they are actually pretty similar ppl lol.

    <TEXT>Tyler is literally the opposite of racist. He's been their only white ally in the game. They don't see what's going on. Bay and day have had the wrong view of Tyler this whole time. Absolutely ludacris to say Tyler is racist when he's the only house guest to actively show he is not. Christmas isnt either BUT the fact that minorities have been heavily targeted is no coincidence. I think that racism, bias, etc is so common and prevalent in US culture they don't even know theyre doing it when they're doing it. I think its clear the white ppl are drawn to each other. This is not uncommon in american society. I don't think anyone in that house is racist I just think it so clearly shows the america we live in. This divide that is so deep people don't even realize its there. These houseguests really do feel they are just playing the game but they don't realize subconsciously they have drawn a racial divide in the house. I say this is an American problem as I really dont feel you see this as much with other big brothers in other countries. This is a very american problem and i hope people realize this doesn't mean everyone is racist it just means it's SO ingrained in the culture and society its going to take alot for it to change. The first step isn't to shout racist at everyone. It's to point it out and to have a discussion about why it's happening.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I'm more predisposed to being heavier too but that has nothing to do with binging. Binging is a psychological problem that's used as a coping skill. Binging is not related to metabolism or hunger. Someone can certainly overeat if their metabolism or hunger works in such a way but binging is a separate issue. Binging is a loss of control. You don't have a loss of control because you have a "fat gene" you have a loss of control because you dont having proper coping skills to deal with emotions, thoughts, or problems effectively. Its the exact same issue that causes alcoholism and drug addiction. I spent 7 years morbidly obese and 10 years before that flipping from skinny to fat. Going on and off diets my whole life. Diets arent sustainable. They don't get to the root of the binge problem which is psychological. I have finally beat binge eating and it was because i got mental health help. Now i have lost 80 pounds WITHOUT diet or exercise. Purely from recovering from binge eating. I will never naturally be a 120 pound woman but it is definitely not natural for me to be 300 pounds. What is realistic for me is probably upper normal range or a little overweight. THAT is relative to metabolism, and predisposition. Unless you have a real medical problem no ones body is naturally going to sit at morbidly obese. That is from thee binge eating. If you solve the binge eating your body will loose weight naturally and return to its normal form but binging is not natural and is not a predisposed condition.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>There were a few things that began my recovery. 1. Change in perception. I was diagnosed with binge eating disorder. Even went through a BED program but I hadn't really accepted the diagnosed and accepted it was a mental health problem. Mostly because I thought it was just my fault. I just thought I was lazy, liked food to much, had no will power. I just blamed myself and thought im just i lazy fatass and could change my weight If i wanted too but im just too lazy. The shift came when I started to realize that everytime i felt sad, anxious, angry, the first thing that popped into my mind was food. What was i going to eat when i got the chance. That realization that my food intake was linked to my emotions was big. It made me realize that i had a bad relationship with food. That food was my drug of choice. I wasn't a drug addict or alcoholic but if i could very easily be. This is when i realized .. Wow. This is a mental illness. This isnt in my control at this point. I accepted that i am going to have to treat this like a mental illness and accept I don't have power over it right now and that its going to be a process because a quick fix diet isnt going to change the fact that i use food to cope with my emotions. A diet doesn't address why i eat when im sad and why I only get pleasure from eating. 2. I got into a mental health program. I got lucky. I was dealing with another mental illness that got me into a dialectical behavioural therapy program. DBT fits very well with a BED diagnoses because ppl with bed often lack coping skills and awareness of their emotions and DBT is a therapy that addresses just that. So at the same time i was having this realization it was because i was in a program which was forcing me to notice my emotions more. This helped me link the eating to my mental health AND taught me different coping skill that were effective which has helped tremendously in getting the binging under control. 3. I stopped dieting, weighing myself, and focusing on my weight. I knew if i could beat BED my weight would start to reduce naturally. I promised to focus on my mental health and accepted that for the time being I would be over weight and had to be okay with that. I knew if I could overcome the eating disorder i would find long term weightloss and not have to deal with this again. I also made a realistic expectation. I said to myself. I have to be okay with giving this time. I told myself its going to take at least a year or 2 to beat bed and to see results. No more quick fixes. I had to prepare to wait and work the program and let my body adjust naturally. I think if you are someone who is still guilting themselves and shaming themselves you may not have accepted the reality of an eating disorder. It may be beneficial to you to read up more about eating disorders as youll likely relate and maybe will see a perception shift. I think its very important to get therapy or get into a program. The best programs focus on CBT and DBT therapy. I found these have been the best when dealing with this. I think a lot of BED programs are working on intuitive eating, etc but that still focuses the problem on the food. The problem isnt the food. Its your mental health. So i would try to find something that focuses on proven mental health therapies like CBT or DBT and once you are in those programs you can add in the intuitive eating, and BED specific stuff. There are also resources online about eating disorders and CBT/DBT therapy. I'm betting there are youtube channels and books dedicated to this treatment.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I personally don't think those were micro aggressions as they have been saying the same thing about christmas. Saying shes going to blow up on someone etc. I think that's just basing it off of her personality and I get why ppl are thinking its a micro agression since black ppl do get labeled crazy if they go off and white ppl generally dont but they have been speaking about christmas the same way and shes white. Shes got an explosive personality as well and regardless of bayleighs skin colour she does too and thats not because shes black thats because she an emotional person period. Shes proven that on 3 separate reality shows. i dont think you can call that a micro agression at this point when they prove time and time again they blow up inappropriately. People of all colour can have emotional issues. This comment had nothing to do with her being black and everything to do with her just being bayleigh. If they said shit like that about david even Day at this point id say i agree but not with Bay because that is the personality she has shown. Thats not her "blackness" that's just her. We know that at this point. As for Tyler's race comment he probably shouldnt have said it out loud BUT bay, day, and david have made it clear it is about race to them. Tyler has spoken to them about it. Hes tried to help them and has encouraged their cause. He is aware race is on their mind and its understandable he would be scared they are going to make it about race. Not smart for him to say but I dont think it was a micro agression as they have made their stance clear and Tyler knows since race is on their mind it's probable they will make this about race too.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>There wasnt personal game info lol. Day is saying that Bay telling her "Day is her untouchable" was personal information. I guess Bay saw that as personal information and Christmas saw it as game information. To be fair the question was asked by bayleigh and she asked "who would you consider to be your untouchable in this game". To ME that sounds like game talk lol. On top of this Bay brought it up and told christmas her answer first. Bay made a mistake by trusting christmas but again that's game play. Bay feels betrayed by christmas which is fair if she thought they were tight but this "personal game information" is bullshit lol. They're just upset with christmas and trying to make it seem like christmas did something wrong. It wasn't nice of christmas but its well within the typical game move. Bay fucked up plain and simple.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>How is she racist? Shes crazy. She's selfish. She's untrustworthy. Don't know how the hell you get racist? Not everyone who argues with a black person is racist Im getting so sick of this narrative. No white person is going to be able to argue with a black person now? Shes worried because she knows this is exactly what ppl do. You have a fight and if theyre a person of colour they call you a racist. In this climate id be fucking afraid too. Just like they jumped to calling Tyler racist even though hes the ONLY white ally theyve had. It's fucking non sense. I think christmas is nuts but shes done nothing to warrant being called a racist. She's had an argument with another human being. Her skin colour doesnt matter in this moment. You really think making white ppl terrified of having conflict with black ppl is going to help with racial divide? Its doing the complete opposite. Its dividing us more. We need to be seen as equals and that means we should be allowed to have arguments without it misconstrued as a racist attack.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Yeah but christmas is being labeled as aggressive and loud lmao. Sometimes ppl are just aggressive and loud lmao. Bayleigh being labeled as such is warranted. Sorry it is not a black thing it is a Bayleigh personality thing. Bayleighs been on BB and on the challenge and both times she lost her shit. She takes things way too personality and doesn't know how to control her emotions. Thats bayleigh. Thats not a micro aggression towards black ppl thats just who she is. Just like people are saying christmas is nuts. Shes a white girl and shes nuts. This is a situation where race isnt coming into play. Bayleigh created that imagine for herself and shes working VERY hard to change it but yeah it makes sense that ppl have called both bayleigh and christmas aggressive and loud because they both are.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I see no need to do any of that since this argument has nothing to do with race. I haven't heard anything Christmas has said to warrant a racist label. I havent heard bay or day call her racist. I know they are worrried about being called crazy black girls but thats their concern over their image. Christmas got in a heated convo with them it wasn't a ploy to make them go off and to "prove they are crazy black girls" And its sad if they think that but thats really their insecurity and has nothing to do with the fight. They are arguing over feeling betrayed by Christmas. That's got nothing to do with race. That's got to do with trust. Shes scared because of ppl like you who scream racist when a white girl yells at a black girl. It was unnecessary hence ppl calling christmas crazy but there is no need for any of them to bring race into because it was a straight up argument about betrayal. That's a common argument for anyone to have in this game to have regardless of race.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>People only see life through their eyes. If they typically eat small meals maybe to them a binge is eating a large meal and a dessert. Obviously most of these people don't understand the real meaning of binging because they don't have an eating disorder and although it would be ideal for everyone to understand mental health terms it's not necessarily their fault, they are just uninformed. It's the same with ppl who say I'm so depressed when they've dropped their ice cream or something lol. Depression is a serious mental illness. They are obviously not depressed but it has become kind of just a cultural slang you use.I think binge has too. Binge for people who don't have disorders just means over eating to them. I also think its not up to us to determined what constitutes a binge. It's very possible that someone who normally eats 2 pieces of pizza felt out of control when they ate 4 and that would be defined as a binge. A binge isn't really about the amount of food you eat it's the state in which you eat it in. I'm in recovery for binge eating. My binges use to be big. 2-3 McDonald's meals in 1 sitting then maybe 3 desserts after. Now that I'm in recovery i don't eat as much and don't eat the same food but that doesn't mean I'm immune to binges. They do however look much different for me now. A binge for me may just be eating a dessert I normally wouldn't eat, or maybe eating 2 snacks instead of one. It doesn't sound like much but I'm eating them because I'm using it as a way to cope and feel out of control. I feel like i cant help it and im using the food to feel better and that's really what makes a binge. Yes it is typically large sums of food and is usually what is required to diagnose bed but I binged today and it consisted of eating 10 perogies. That may not seem like a binge to most but to me it was because I was upset, i specifically went to food to make me feel better, and i ate more than i normally would while feeling unable to control it. They are not bad people if they say things like this. They do not think they are offending anyone by saying this. If it affects you, you can inform them how what they are saying may be insensitive to ppl with eating disorders. Beyond that I would try not to take it to heart. People are unaware of others pain. It's not being said maliciously. I know its easier to just say oh fuck you but being angry about stuff ppl arent aware of isn't going to serve you. I used to be angry at everything ppl did i thought was wrong and i was angry all the time. It's exhausting to always be angry.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I didnt even know binge eating disorder was a disorder until i was diagnosed and i knew and used the word binge often. Just because people use the word binge doesnt mean they even know what BED is. This is a disorder that is JUST starting to gain recognition. It's completely understandable that a lot of people arent aware of it and use the word binge as they know it ( unrestrained and often excessive indulgence) binge is a term used for drinking, watching tv, spending money) it does not soley mean binge eating disorder and it doesn't have to.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Bayleigh has always had a victim complex. She messes up and blames other ppl for it. She said on the feeds she told Christmas she didnt want to be put in a situation where she had to yell and is blaming Christmas for putting her in that "very situation I asked her not to put me in". Last time i checked no one HAS TO yell at anyone even if they themselves are being yelled at. I don't fault bayleigh for getting upset. If shes hurt by Christmas thats fine but she fucked up. She told someone vital information about her game. It was her game mistake and Christmas is HOH. she had limited options since shes got a thing going with most ppl in the house so shes targeted Bayday BUT shes an idiot for saying that as an excuse she should have known bay would take it personally regardless and her saying that was christmas's mistake. She could have just said you guys are a string pair and good competitor's. I wish Bayleigh would take reaponsiblity for her mistakes. So far shes blamed Tyler who was trying to help her, now christmas who has a game to win, and basically everyone else in the house but day and herself lol. She thinks she was played by the house. You played yourself girl lol.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>100%. I dont think this game can go on. Not the american version anyways. Race is way to big of an issue in the usa right now and the big brother magnifies the divides because its so ingrained in this nation a divide happens without the houseguests even realizing it but watching it, its very clear. This is deep rooted shit and this is exactly what its going to keep looking like. Ppl finding ways to call ppl racist. I dont know why anyone would want to go on that show and its getting exhausting following it because somehow it always ends up about race even this stupid thing with christmas and the thing before with tyler. Nothing to do with race yes bb Twitter is screaming racists. Its insane. If i were a white person i.wouodnt want to be put in a situation where i cant have an argument with another person because their skin colour is different. This kind of shit it making the divide worse not better. Maybe think about that to the ppl who love to shout foul play!</TEXT>

    <TEXT>BB21 cast had straight up racists on the show. They we're called out because they were actually saying racist things about the black houseguests. That was 100% deserved. Some of them were absolutely racist and there is hard proof of it from the feeds. This Tyler and Christmas racist thing is a sign of the time. Now it doesn't seem to matter if they actually are racist. If ppl perceive even "micro aggressions" they are racist. Christmas and Tyler have been supposedly been using micro aggressions by saying bay will blow up if shes on the block. The thing is that's true and has absolutely nothing to do with her race. It has to do with her personality. Bays been on 3 reality shows now and shes blown up to a ridiculous level on all of them. The reason she gets labeled this way is not because ppl think shes a ghetto black girl its because shes emotional. The ppl she blew up at on the shows did not react the same way she did which is why they weren't labeled in that way. So now because there is a history of calling black ppl loud and crazy you cant call any of them that or its a micro aggression appearently. I get what they are saying. I wouldn't say that about david or day even but bayleigh 100% cannot control her emotions and thats not relative to her skin colour. Its evident by the fact Tyler was literally their only genuine white ally in the house and he got labeled a racist just because he did not end up being backdoored. Now Christmas is being labeled a racist because she got in a fight with 2 black girls. Ppl thinks shes racist because she put them up when there are other targets in the house. If they are watching the game they know shes working with pretty much everyone else in the game and her alliance want them out. It was a game move. Has their been a racial divide since the beginning of the game? Absolutely. Is it because anyone is racist? I don't think so and that's really the problem here. This divide is so ingrained in american society a divide happens so naturally and unconsciously. That's pretty obvious to see but its not because these houseguests are racist its because america is fucking broken and they are a product of that. Chritmas is now being called crazy and rightly so. She acted like Bayleigh use to act in this situation so she being called crazy. I think that alone makes it clear its not ablut skin colour its about how you handle the situation As for Day, her getting upset about having argument its understandable why she feels this way. There has definitely been a double standard when it comes to black ppl and white ppl arguing. Its true that the blame usually gets put on the black person simply because they get passionate or "loud" but this situation didn't warrant this reaction. Day and her weren't even really fighting that much. I just think Day is so over aware of it now shes terrified to let it happen so she broke down at the thought that she just came off a way she didnt want to. She didnt, but this is what happens to these big brother ppl. They are all so engulfed with their own personal reasons for being there and "fixing" their own image that sometimes these fights end up not actually being what the fights about and this is the case here. Bay and Day are more upset about the fact the were put in this situation of having an argument than the reason for the argument itself.</TEXT>

I agree christmas escalated it and it was unnessecary. I dont think bayleigh did anything wrong in this case but christmas has her own insecurities about being called a bully. The reason it blew up so much was because bayleigh and day dont want to be seen yelling and christmas doesnt want to been seen as a bully and this situation made them all feel like this was hurting their image and thats why emotions ran high. It really is all blown out of proportion and ultimatley isn't even about what they are actually fighting about lol. Its all to do with their underlining insecurities lol</TEXT>

    <TEXT>This interesting. I watched the live clips so didnt see it edited together like this. Now seeing it like this I think Day overreacted here. I really don't think EITHER of them was at an aggressive point. That just looked like a discussion to me. I think Day was right to leave. I think if they kept going esp with Bay coming in it would have gotten heated and escalated so she shut it down before that happened BUT her reaction doesnt seem to match what was going on between them at that point. Obviously im not in her shoes, she could have taken the way christmas was talking as very aggressive but as the outside looking in. I dont think either of them escalated the convo or stepped outta line so i am actually a little confused about Days reaction in the back yard. Bay and christmas is a different situation. Christmas totally escalated that but playing devils advocate coming from a mental health background lol. I can see exactly why it happened. Its one thing to have one person arguing with you but when its two ppl, ppl panic as they feel ganged up on ( even if they aren't actively being ganged up on) and its not surprising she went into defense mode. I think if bayleigh hadnt entered this would have ended better but of course the discussion is about her, not surprising she wanted to get involved. I can see this from both point of views for sure. I dont think there is a villan in this. I think they all have their vulnerabilities right now and that can lead to these kind of actions. Edit. I watched it again lol. Actually bayleigh is not innocent in the escalation of this to be honest. I think they were both speaking respectfully but then Bay told Christmas she couldnt speak by saying "no" when christmas asked to finish speaking. When you straight up shut someone down like that they are going to shutdown. So she leaves the convo. That makes sense to me. And if you watch it Bay actually raises the tone first telling christmas " you used me and you know you used me". So actually and im sure ppl will be mad at me for this lmao. I see Bay as the escalator here. NOW christmas took it too a whole other level with the yelling, fingers, and clapping etc etc. That was clearly unnecessary but when you look at it play by play lol im even surprised to say that christmas did not escalate this conversation. She was wrong in how she handled the outcome which is why she has become the villan but from what I see she didn't escalate it and shouldnt be blamed for the fight in general. If anything she should be criticised for how she reacted to the fight and becoming disrespectful but she really wasn't the escalator here. Sorry to say bayvonne fans lol.</TEXT>

She thinks he was starting a romance rumour basically and it makes sense if that is what she thinks, being married,of course she would think thats disrespectful lol but we all seem to know kaysar did not mean it that way so hopefully that will become clear when she gets out the house lol.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Its so stupid because their hating on tyler for their own conspiracy theories about him lmao. Theyve basically made up this whole character in their heads that doesnt exisit. He was genuinely trying to be their ally and they are legit so clueless. I think Day will look back and say "oh damn, my bad " lol but the sad thing is Bay will keep this delusional story in her head because she can't take responsibility for any of her mistakes and needs to have someone to pin them on. Honestly im glad Tyler decided to stay and separate from them. It was seriously a loosing battle. She just wants him to be the villan so badly. I dont think it matters what he did she will always find a way to blame him for something.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Yeah i duno about that. I watched it 3 separate times and the more i watched it the more i realized both we're being respectful. I didnt think christmas was talking down to her. I think christmas just like Bayleigh was trying to get her perspective across. I dont think thats talking down to someone and christmas was letting bayleigh talk. I do think that "no" was uncalled for. Christmas, right before that, had let her finish speaking, then christmas began, she hadnt finished, bayleigh then started, and christmas asked to finish and thats when she said no. Watch it back. I was surprised myself believe me i was totally in the christmas caused shit for no reason boat but if you actually watch what happens Bayleighs little "no" comment is what switched the gears of that conversation. Until then they were both just airing out their perspective of the situation. Christmas left a bad taste with the way she handled the situation after that FOR SURE. 100% Christmas was disrespectful BUT after seeing this fight play out multiples time you can see that comment from bayleigh is what caused the escalation so lets just chalk it up to no one is innocent in this situation lol.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Someone posted a podcast on here that I think said it best. Almost every cast member is traumatized in someway from their previous seasons and ultimate assignation of their character by toxic fans. We are seeing the result of that trauma unfold on our screen. Tylers depression and anxiety are due to his character being questioned on the game and his fight with bayleigh on 20. His personal values are at odds with how he needs to play and is trying to avoid a false narrative about him which unfortunately has already begun. Bayleigh trying not to yell because ppl have called her crazy which has lead to her trying to avoid any conflict but this has also caused her to become overly emotional when she feels shes forced into an argument. Day getting called loud and ghetto which is the same result as Bay. She being devastated when shes felt she was forced to "speak loudly", christmas being called a bully on her season AND her criminal charges. Shes trying to prove shes nice and gets angry when she feels bayday are trying to paint her as a villan. David doesnt trust ANYONE because of the ppl he played with last season. We all saw how nicole acted because of her last season. This is no longer their personality this is all due to what the bb community did to them when they left the house. Everyone in there is WAY more concerned about their image and potential backlash then they are out of the house rather than playing a good game and you know whos fault that is? Ours. Because we arent letting them be human. We are screaming racist, crazy, etc at them because we are completely exaggerating situations and love to hate. Ppl mad at what big brother has become? Well it's the fans that made it that way. Its interesting to see that the old school players dont have as many as these problems and I think that speaks to the times they were on big brother. As the years go on the online bullying and cancelling of people is becoming more extreme and it's affecting their mental health greatly. Quite clearly. I dont think we can understand what its like to be attacked 24/7 across all social media platforms and maybe even in person. Image a few ppl bullying you in highschool and then multiply that by thousands. I dont think we can fault these cast members for having anxiety, depression, and straight up trauma from these experiences and we as fans should recognize this isnt them. This isnt their personality this is because of us. We've created these ppl that are absolutely terrified of coming out of the house because they know anything they do will be twisted to fit the internets narrative. I really do think big brother america should be shutdown. It's become this breeding place for toxic behaviour from the fans and though the ppl do benefit from the show. Mostly financially we are creating really damaged adults and i personally dont find that acceptable. Stop going on big brother America ppl. Thats my PSA for you. I think the whole fan base needs to find some empathy. Put yourself in their shoes and tell me you wouldn't be affected in some way if that was you</TEXT>

    <TEXT>The worst part was memphis making the comment of him standing over the bed rocking because that was a joke where the punchline was ians rocking which is part of his autism. It's absolutely making fun of his need to rock to self soothe and shows memphis is not tolerant of people who are different. That's 100% out of bounds. I think dani complaining about the rocking is understandable as she's not making fun of it but just expressing how it makes her feel and i think everyone should be able to express their feelings BUT it does show a lack of tolerance/ empathy. She's complaining about something not exactly in his control because of autism and shes saying that stresses her out. Its kind of like saying someones wheelchair is annoying her. It's something they need to deal with the condition. Why would anyone verbally express their dislike for it. I mean sure you can express that, but if you were really a tolerant/empathetic person you wouldnt because you would be empathetic to why they are doing that and wouldnt feel a need to make it about yourself. Ppl are just intolerant in general. Just always thinking about themselves is what it comes down to. Shes more concerned about how she feels about the rocking than feeling empathetic towards Ian.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Mineral sunscreens are key i feel if you have acne. For me i use the weightless liquid mineral spf 30 from First Aid Beauty @ Sephora. I used to use Clinique 50 spf but i heard they changed the formula and it isnt great anymore. The first aid beauty is stupid expensive at like $45. The good thing is you need soooo little product to cover your face so it lasts. If your not into spending that much the best drug store sunscreen that has been touted by dermatologists and cosmetologist alike is the Cerave sheer tinted spf 30 or Cerave hydrating spf 30. I haven't tried these as i am still have lots of first aid beauty left but my next purchase im going to try Cerave for something less expensive. I think key for sunscreens too is making sure your doing a good cleanse after a day of wearing sunscreen. I use a scrubbing brush ( light scrub) to make sure I get it all out if my pores. I havent really has an issue since switching to these face specific formulas.</TEXT>

Theres no way to know for sure side effects, etc, after a few months of human trials. I rather continue to social distance and wear masks etc than get a vaccine that's fresh off the market. I am not an antivaxer, i am not a conspiracy theorist, i am not right leaning at all but this feels like the safest way to me. I think a vaccine will come and if properly proven I will be happy to get it once it's being safely used in the public for a while.

    <TEXT>The best thing you can do is tell yourself its okay. Its normal to not eat everyday of your life perfect. 1 bad day isnt going to ruin the progress youve made. Just tell yourself its okay. I actually did this exact thing this week. Ive been in recovery 10 months and have had a lot of changes lately. I binged and I did feel bad but mostly because I was sad that I clearly will still use food if I get too stressed. Anyways i decided to just tell myself its okay and not dwell on it. Its not a failure at all. Its not like you have to start from the beginning. Im still in recovery 10 months. That wont be taken away because i binged one meal. It's more important to have a sustainable eating plan than one that is not. A plan that requires you to eat perfectly 24/7 for the next 60 years just isnt realistic. Part of recovery will be finding acceptance when you do binge or over eat because it absolutely will happen again and thats okay. That is normal. It was one day and tomorrow is a new one. Be kind to yourself, try to just move forward and leave it behind you. Thats it. If you dont dwell and guilt yourself for it you wont have that rebound guilt binge.</TEXT>

You can train that they cant come into certain rooms like kitchen and bathroom. You can even start training routine. Making him go to his bed every night at 7pm or something. It's not the funniest thing to train lol but once they are trained you'll be happy you did it.</TEXT>

If anything these girls should be condemned for their lack of ability to think for themselves. All the girls in the committee are the same. Trying to be what the men want them to be. Ive seen on the feeds a distinct difference between when the girls hang around cody and when they hang around memphis. They try to speak nicer of ppl when with cody because he typically doesn't agree if they say something mean while when they are with memphis they constantly talk shit. Thats the power of shitty ppl. The sheep don't know how to think for themselves. Social experiment indeed. Proving how easy it is to mold someone who seemingly has no free will.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>A lot of ppl think willpower is an actual thing lol. Will power can be applied IF you have power over things and all it takes is a little will lol. I have no idea why people think mental illness comes down to will power. Its because they have no idea what they are talking about really. People can only relate through their experiences. You say your depressed and someone may think about their worst feeling of depression. Maybe a break up, because they felt depressed they can understand HOW you feel but cant understand WHY you cant get better. Because people without mental illness typically have episodic depression ( based on life events not on chemical imbalance, genetics, trauma, etc) they make the assumption if they can do it so can you. That's where this will power shit comes from. People think they had the will power to get over their exes so you just need will power to get over your mental illness lol. When you have a disorder like this. Especially this one because it is not understood by the regular public at all you have to find some acceptance in the fact that most ppl will not understand and most ppl will probably say the wrong thing. You can either try to have a conversation with them about how you feel when they say things like that you or you have to chalk it up to, they have good intentions but ill have to accept they probably don't have the understanding to comfort me in the way i need. Its shitty. Esp from a SO. You should probably try to speak with them about it but after a while you may have to just have to let it go and find another support system.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Yeah so you need to find a way to distract yourself from not counting calories. Just like binging it's another compulsion but this compulsion adds fuel to the fire. Just like i had to force myself to stop weighing myself everyday. Your first step would be to avoid the temptation to add up those calories in your head. When you get the urge do something else. Find a way to cope with the thoughts of wanting to tally up the food. You may know exactly what you are eating when you are eating it but you still have to do the math to figure out the total and that is something you can work to stop.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Counting calories makes binge eating worse. It like the last thing you should do if you want to get better. Anytime you go over your calories limit you feel shame and guilt and that shame and guilt leads to more binging. If you really want to try to get better stop counting calories and just eat. If you want to lose weight i guarentee you, you will not loose it by going on a diet, not long term anyways. The only way you will loose weight and keep it off is to recover from binge eating disorder and that means stopping problematic behaviours like counting calories, weighing yourself, restricting food. Anything that makes you feel depressed if you dont stick to it you need to stop because binge eating is a coping mechanism and if you keep giving yourself stuff to cope with your going to cope with food. You need to remove as much stuff that can make you feel bad about yourself and the most obvious is a calorie goal, weight goal, and diet goal.</TEXT>

Let's break it down: Binge eating is a coping mechanism. A coping mechanism is something you do to feel better when you have strong emotions you don't know how to effectively deal with like sadness, anger, shame, guilt, disgust, anxiety, ect. When you force yourself to adhere to a calorie goal you are putting yourself in a situation to have an emotional outcome if you do not stick to your goal. It IS NOT realistic to eat only a certain amount of calories everyday for the rest of your life. You WILL at some point go over those calories and when you do these feelings of sadness, anger, shame, guilt, disgust, or anxiety will come over you. Since you don't have an effective way to deal with those emotions you will binge to make yourself feel better. counting calories = increased binging. This goes the same for weight goals, diet goals, restricting certain foods. It's not a realistic sustainable goal. It will eventually end in failure which will end in a binge. Give yourself a fighting chance and remove that stressor from your life. Remove weighing, counting, restricting. You don't need more things in your life causing you to have an emotional reaction you cant cope with. If you drop these practices from your life it is one less thing leading to a binge. Real talk: the only way you will loose weight AND KEEP IT OFF. Is to recover from binge eating disorder. You will not recover from binge eating disorder if you are doing the above problematic behaviours because it feeds the binging disorder. The problem here is not your willpower or the food you eat. It is your lack of coping skills. Put down the calorie app and pick up a DBT or CBT therapy book to help you learn how to detect your emotions and how to cope with them more effectively. This isn't an appetite issues. It is a mental health issue. You need to treat it as such.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>That's where the mental health part comes in. It's not like your body has just forgotten what hunger is. It's that you have spent so much time using food for a different purpose thats what you are associating it with. Ive been in recover 10 months. Ive lost 80 pounds. I could have never focused on this eating disorder until i focused on my mental health. If you don't have that bit sorted or at very least started the binge eating is going to be a real battle. BED is a symptom not a cause. It's a symptom of a mental health issue. I started by completely stopping my attempts to stop BED and loose weight. I did that because i knew this would go on forever if i didn't address my mental health. I accepted that it may take me a year or longer but if I don't fix the mental health bit ill never fix the binge eating. So i accepted that i would be overweight, that i would continue to eat, and i accepted that reality for now because i was sick of the yoyo-ing. I wanted to find long term success. Thing is once i did that everything changed. With a new perspective i actually started loosing weight naturally within the first month of this new outlook. Because i was focused on the mental part and not the physical part I naturally didn't feel the binge urges as much and even when i did because i wasn't beating myself up about it so i didn't have rebound guilt binges. Without trying i was loosing weight. I know it sounds crazy. But in order to loose weight you have to give up trying to loose weight. I NEVER thought i would be down 80 pounds and counting in less than a year. I had accepted that probably wouldn't happen for a long time. As soon as i gave up trying to control everything it all occured naturally. It is Extremely hard to give up control. Eating disorders are all about control but thats exactly why you have to give it up. Find acceptance and work on the important part which is learning about your emotions and how to cope with them. Mentally its been a journey but physically its been the easiest weight loss ive ever had lol. Ive finally learned how to eat like normal because i was no longer worrying about what i was eating. Now im able to eat a variety of food without seeing it as good or bad but just seeing it as food. This will all come naturally as you recover but the first step is changing something. Dieting clearly isnt working, counting calories clearly isnt working, try something different, try the opposite. Most success stories you see started with ppl stopping these restrictive behaviours. Its like that for a reason.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Yes. This is what youve been told. And yes, this would be the case if you didnt have an eating disorder but if you are on this sub i assume you do and by feeding into this diet culture you are exasperating your eating disorder. What do you think is worse for you? Eating a variety of food everyday, eating moderately, and eating proper portions. Or starving yourself for days and then binging thousands of calories in a day or sitting. Ill tell you, its the first one. The way you get to the first one is by concurring the eating disorder. Not only will you not loose weight effectively while still dealing with an eating disorder you will have far worse health issues because of this binge, starve cycle. Its far better to eat a little worse everyday while maintaining proper portions than to eat within such extremes. I have not been counting my calories AT ALL since being in recovery but i can tell you for damn sure i am eating more on a daily bases than i did before. I am certainly NOT exercising the calories i eat off because i dont exercise at all. So with that logic i should be gaining or maintaining weight, right? Yet ive some how lost 80 pounds. All due to the fact i just dont binge anymore. Your body will 100% react more favorably to a regular moderate diet than it will with this extreme change from day to day. Thats the reality. Look at other success stories. If it works for you thats fine but all I hear is diet culture bullshit that doesn't help most ppl with BED. Its a tired narrative that is starting to disappear because it only brings on short term success.</TEXT>

If we allow them to run bullshit like this you can say goodbye to your favorite shows and your favourite celebrities because they can obviously be cancelled by a completely fake story.

    <TEXT>Absolutely. I'm close to a year in recovery. I would say the first 1-2 months were the most difficult but a lot of it really is just breaking the habit. When you break the habit of going to food when your upset etc. Whatever youre doing instead will become the new normal. Keep sticking with it, it will absolutely pay off and is possible. I think the key is of course using coping skills and also for the first bit trying your hardest to reduce your stress so you can make it easier on yourself. Ive been in recovery a while now and when I get really upset i definitely still have the urge to binge. I have binged a few times in recovery but the difference is its not the end of the world anymore because I know ive got the skills to get back on track. Im also able to fight the urge a lot easier now because im so much more aware of the other things i can to do cope. When you build up an arsenal of skills to use instead of food it'll become a lot easier to choose the 10 other things you can do instead but it takes time for your brain to disassociate food with with making you feel better. I'll be at a year soon. I NEVER thought it would be possible to be here in my recovery. If you keep going soon this will be you!</TEXT>

    <TEXT>It's certainly in the same spectrum. OCD tendencies often come about as a coping mechanism so does binge eating. I bet if you went into therapy for OCD it would help your binge eating as well because the type of therapy you would get for ocd would focus on alternative coping skills therefore helping both illnesses. Hopefully how that you have a diagnoses you can find proper treatment and be closer to recovery. If you have an option CBT or DBT therapy is the best. If you can find a program that has group therapy to teach these skills AND allows for individual sessions that's usually the best route to go.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Its very hard to because a lot of progress is made in challenging your perceptions and beliefs about stuff and that can be very difficult to do on your own. It often takes an outside observation or a trained professional to help you realize what you haven't seen yourself. Not everyone can get into these programs though especially if you are in a country that doesnt have universal health care. In that case your next best scenario may be going through a workbook on your own. If you go on amazon there are workbooks on DBT for binge eating disorder, or CBT for OCD. The program i was in used the marsha linden DBT workbook and another program i was in used a workbook from amazon as well so these are legitimate books that are being used by professionals. I would also try to find a youtube channel or podcast you like. There will be hundreds on these subjects. Maybe from someone in recovery or from a professional but watching/listening to others perspectives and ideas can help open up your mind to things you may not be seeing.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>If you really want to lose weight don't weigh yourself through this process. Weighing will absolutely trigger binging if you don't see what you like. If you avoid it, you won't get emotional about it, and it won't have an effect on your mood and therefore your disorder. I went for 3 months without weighing myself. Without knowing it I lost 25 pounds. The minute I started weighing myself again, I started binging because I was putting myself in a position for disappointment. Let it happened naturally. If you stop binging you will absolutely lose weight naturally but 1 week isn't going to be an indication of anything and if you monitor it you are playing right into the disorder. You either focus on your binging, mental health, coping skills... or doing the opposite; dieting, weighing, restricting. Try something different this time. You may be surprised by the outcome. Avoiding the urge to weigh is just as important as avoiding the urge to binge with this disorder.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Anyone else thinks it's SUPER weird they are supposedly hiring 500 nurses but they are still laying off teachers? Instead of keeping teaching so they can do smaller classes they are laying off teachers and having larger classes. What exactly is the purpose of a nurse? Kids get sick they go to them and they tell them to go home lmao. Nurses can't do anything but MAYBE give a COVID test. If someone is sick they are already sick a nurse can't do anything about it. It would be way more useful to keep all teachers on and split up class sizes to REDUCE the chance of spreading than to have a nurse who can really only tell us the obvious. The amount of money they are spending on the salaries of nurses will be insane, yet they can't afford more teachers or even to keep the teacher they have on for some unknown reason. It's like Ford has this special vendetta against the teachers union. It's like he's completely sensible when it comes to most things COVID but because he has this hate for the teachers Union he doesn't give a shit about anything but making their lives harder. I really don't understand and it is so clear this is personal for god knows fucking why. Cause he was butt hurt by them because of their previous strike? It's absolutely insane.</TEXT>

Listen i love nurses and if they want to put a nurse in every school thats fine but there is really nothing more they can do to stop the spread of covid than anyone else. If they allowed more teacher to teach instead of less we would reduce the risk with smaller classes. A nurse is going to sit in a school for 8 hours a day to take a temperature and do admin work the school could do? I much rather have a trained nurse at a hospital for the really ill people than have them waste their day. Its a waste of tax payers money, and its a negligent use of resources. If they cant afford to keep teachers on how the hell are they paying for 500 nurses?</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Real talk lol. You'll lose weight by recovering from binge eating disorder but the chances of you recovering from binge eating disorder by trying to loose weight isnt likely. Loosing weight, restricting food, counting calories, and weighing yourself are the most common reasons people don't recover from BED. Anytime you have a goal set out for yourself that revolves around loosing weight youre feeding the eating disorder. This happens because your setting up goals for yourself that revolves around a big part of the reason you have an eating disorder... Your self image. Everytime you fail at one of these goals ( and you will fail because the goals are not sustainable 24/7) it then triggers the other reason you have an eating disorder and thats lack of coping skills. You are quite literally doing the opposite of what you should be doing with an eating disorder. You may not want to hear it but you need to stop trying to lose weight to lose weight. Put the weight loss aside for 6 months to a year. Quit dieting, weighing, and restricting. Switch your focus to your mental health. Get in an ED program or a therapy program that involves cbt or dbt therapy. Learn how to identify your emotions and how to cope with the effectively. A lot of the times when ppl have removed the pressure of weight loss and have successfully started to identify alternative coping mechanisms the binge eating gets better. When the binge eating gets better the weight loss comes naturally. I did this exact thing 11 months ago. I quit dieting, weighing, and trying to loose weight. I accepted the weight i was at FOR NOW so i could focus on my mental health. It meant i accepted the binges for what they were because I knew the way out was through mental health help. Its labeled a mental illness for a reason. It was funny because once i actively and truly stopped trying to lose weight... The weight actually started falling off. No diet, no exercise, no restricting, no anything. The reason it was coming off was simply because i wasn't binging as much. Some of that happened just because I stopped focusing on weight loss. The rest of the binging stopped when I learned effective mental health skills. Ive lost 85 pounds and counting in the last 11 months. It's physically been the most and easiest weightloss ive ever had and the really great part about it... Is i know for the first time i may actually stay this way because I have learned how to stop the thing that kept me yo-yoing. You will never find long term weightloss without recovery. You may find weightloss but it won't be because you beat BED if your doing it by dieting or calorie counting. Its not easy. Its a big mind fuck. Stop trying to lose weight to lose weight, i mean wtf right lol. But it works for us with BED. We arent going to benefit from "willpower" we are not like the average eater. We have a mental illness and it needs to be treated as such. Binging is a symptom. You need to fix the root problem if you want to get better. No amount of restricting. Or calorie counting regardless if its just "maintenance" counting will fix a mental illness. The calories are not the issue here. Your mental health is.</TEXT>

When you go to checkout it will automatically runs through the codes it has and will place the one with the biggest discount. Ive saved quite a few bucks with it but now theyve also added "honey coins" so when you do shop, even if they didnt find you a discount code they give you these coins back if you purchase at participating stores. I buy all my makeup online at Sephora and they are partnered with them. My last order with Sephora has gotten me enough points to collect a $10 gift card. Not bad for doing nothing but my regular shopping lol. Great for extra discounts and if you shop online alot you could even get money back. They even have an amazon tracker now that lets you know if the product you want has increased or decrease in price lately. I say its pretty useful for free. Im not affiliated at all lol but if your interested you can click the link or simply look up the app on the chrome store. [Join Honey](https://www.joinhoney.com/ref/ergnat)</TEXT>

Hense BED being called a mental illness. Its kinda like drug addiction isn't really about drugs. It's their method to cope but its ultimately not because they love meth soooo much.

    <TEXT>It's not easy. It requires a really big change in perception. The few things that helped change my perception was: 1. I realized my emotions were completely linked to why I binge. I felt sad, angry, anxious, basically anything and my first thought was... What am I going to eat. That made me realize it really did have nothing to do with food or willpower. It was linked to my emotions which are linked to my mental health. I clearly was using food as a coping mechanism and if I wanted to beat binge eating I had to fix the source of it. Which was mental health 2. After that realization I knew the only way out was to focus on getting better. I had a lot of radical accepting to do. I had to accept I had an eating disorder, which is a mental illness, which will only get better if treated as such. I accepted that since it was a mental illness it was going to take time to get better. I accepted that if I wanted to get better I had to stop putting my focus in areas that didnt solve the problem ( dieting, etc) and put it on areas that would (mental health). I accepted that there would be no quick fix which meant I had to accept being obese for a while ( this was probably the hardest one). I told myself id probably be looking at 1-2 years minimum to beat an eating disorder and I had to accept that this is just the way im going to have to look for that time while I get better. Id dealt with being obese for 7 straight years and on and off for years before that. Whats 2 more years if it cures me for the rest of my life.. I had to accept that realistic timeline. Diets have warped my mind to thinking theres a quick fix to everything but this wasnt going to be the same. I knew if I could focus all my attention on mental health that I would eventually get better and hopefully never have to deal with being obese again because Ive finally stopped the source of the binging 3. I vowed to stop doing everything that had never worked. Diets, restricting, counting calories, weighing myself. They haven't work for 7+ years. It was time to change the approach. 4. I no longer wanted to focus on weight. I was completely focused on health. I focused on what I wanted to feel not what i wanted to look like. I had IBS, painful cystic acne, an autoimmune disorder that was outta control, I was exhausted all the time, and always had aches and pains. I focused on how to make those things better and that did require removing some things from my diet but it was amazing because when I focused on what I wanted to feel like vs look like it didnt trigger binges what so ever. The consequence was no longer " im going to stay fat" it was "i dont feel good right now" and that immediate consequence of eating food that isnt good for me is what drove me to adopt a healthier eating habit. It's a happy bonus I lost weight but more importantly I got rid of my acne, I healed my gut, my autoimmune disease reduced 3 stages, I even noticed my mood lift. I didnt give up foods i like though. I only gave up foods if they caused me physical pain. The change in perception seemed really vital for me to be successful Its funny because as soon as I did all that. It only took about a month or 2 to start loosing weight lol. I was working on my mental health but the simple act of quitting problematic behaviours, accepting my life as it was, and changing the focus to listening to my body instead of my mind, helped stop alot of binge urges. It's been 10 months. Ive lost 80 pounds. No diet, no exercise. Just proper mental health care. I did a DBT program. CBT is good as well. An ED program based on one of these therapies is best, if you have access to it.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>For me personally I have other mental health issues as well. I suffer from BPD which usually comes with depression, anxiety, etc. I have a feeling though that BED is a symptom of other issues. Not nessesarily a full blown disorder like me but im sure chronic depression and anxiety will be the case for alot of ppl with BED so the first step is usually to get a proper diagnoses. Im in Canada so the system here works differently than some other countries but my steps were: 1. To get my family doctor to refer me for a psychiatric assessment. If you already haven't had one ideally research some facilities ( usually hospitals or mental health facilities) that have programs for Eating disorders, CBT or DBT therapy and ask to go for your assessment there. The place that will do your assessment will likely refer you to one of their programs so its good to go somewhere you want to try to get into to. If you haven't been assessed properly before this its probably the hardest first step because general practitioners will try to treat you themselves first. Often with antidepressants, or anxiety meds( which could be very helpful for overall mental health and MAY help reduce binges but will not solve the problem long term as therapy is required). Alot of doctors are starting to prescribe stimulants as well for appetite control for BED. I strongly suggest you refuse this option until you have had a psychiatric assessment as this is a serious drug, with serious side effects, that does not help mood, it really only helps to control appetite which sounds lovely but that's not your issue and will not solve your issue. If the specialist wants to prescribe these along with a mental health program I can see the benefit that may bring but do not let your GP push pills on you without any therapy components. You have to be your own avocate when it comes to mental health. That's why its great to research programs on your own and bring them specifically to your doctors and ask them to refer you there. I would even go on the programs websites, print out the referral forms, and bring them to my doctors office to sign lol. A proper diagnoses is soooo important because it opens the door up to speciality programs that you may otherwise not have access to unless you paid for a private program. In Canada mental health is covered if you are referred out by your doctor. If not your option is to go private which is extremely expensive. If you have the money, great. If not you may have to jump through some hoops and insist to your doctor this is what you require. BED could also be a symptom of a deeper problem, and unchecked disorder ( not always the case) so this is why an assessment is really important. It can really be a turning point especially if you have something undiagnosed you aren't aware of. If you don't then you know the eating disorder is the only thing you need to focus on. Its a win win. Information is power. 2. Started researching information that I could help myself with. Like I said DBT and CBT therapy is going to be the best kind of therapy for BED. I really think DBT is gold standard. These days there are lots of online tools you can use that may help while you wait for a referral or if you simply can't afford care ( if you dont have insurance). Look up books/workbooks for binge eating disorder. When I google DBT for binge eating disorder quite a few websites pop up so go check those out. See if they offer any material. Similarly if you search DBT for binge eating on amazon a few books come out. I am sure those will be great resources to get you started. Youtube and podcasts also have great information. Search youtube or even google best youtube/podcasts for binge eating. Youll find professionals and people in recovery that can give you tips on how to move forward. Note: Intuitive eating has been a popular treatment for BED but personally I dont think it gets to the root of the problem, as intuitive eating still focuses ALL on the food which isn't the main issue. Thats why I continue to say focus on CBT or DBT. These programs are made to change the way you think about the world in general. It gives you effective coping skills and helps you notice your emotions. this is a very important component to recovery. Once you have gone through the DBT program then an intuitive eating program will be great if you are still struggling with the food part. 3. That perspective change. Telling myself my mental health is the most important thing so trying to put myself in an ideal situation to make that happen. Making sure I had the time so I could do the program. Making sure I was avoiding situations that caused me extreme stress. Making sure I stopped focusing on what didnt work like ( dieting, etc) and focusing just on how to fix the mental health bit. Researching a ton so i understood the eating disorder and what steps i needed to take to solve it.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Wellbutrin is a pretty good med for depression. Its well tolerated. Its been the med ive stayed on the longest. Wellbutrin will help your mood but it won't cure your binge eating disorder. A lift in mood can certainly contribute to less urges and less binges and maybe a remission in binge eating due to feeling mentally better but the source of your binge eating still remains which means the chance of you relapsing is likely. This is because binge eating is a coping mechanism. If you feel better mentally you may not need to cope as much which is why it helps but as soon as an event happens, life gets hard, maybe the medication looses its effect, you will turn to binging again because you actually haven't learned how to cope effectively. I think wellbutrin is a great medication but if youre using it primarily to treat BED you need a therapy component or you'll find yourself coming back to binging. Just want to put that out there. Ive been on antidepressants for 15 years and my BED did come and go but it wasnt until I got into a dbt therapy program did I actually recover from it. You need that duel treatment to make sure you dont fall back into BED and can truly recover. I would personally suggest avoiding vyvanse unless you have adhd. It has a lot of side effects and can make your quality of life worse, in my opinion. I would recommend an antidepressant/therapy route first before you try stimulants.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>There is no difference between fasting and restricting. In fact you are fasting and restricting since you have a calorie limit lol. Anytime you restrict anything about the way you eat ( the type of food, the calories, the time, etc, ) you are restricting. It seems you know restricting is not good for BED but maybe not why. Restricting is bad because putting rules on your eating isn't sustainable. There is no reality that exists that you are going to be able to eat like this every single day of your life till you are 80 years old. This is a problem because when we can't eat within the rules we see it as a "failure" and that triggers a binge. Essentially you are causing binges by trying to stop binging. The reason we binge is because we use it as a coping mechanism. We don't know effective ways to deal with our emotions so we eat. That why when we perceive a failure we binge. It brings up sadness, guilt, shame, and the only way we know how to deal with it is to binge. The reason you find it hard not to continuously eat throughout the day has really nothing to do with your inability to stop, your inability to listen to hunger cues, or your willpower in general. Its because you have constant emotions or thoughts that you don't know how to deal with. You may not even realize you have these emotions which is why a lot of people don't put it together that this is the reason for their binging. Binge eating disorder is a mental illness for a reason. Its the same reason drug addiction is a mental illness. Food is just the coping mechanism, it isn't the actual problem. If you want to recover from BED you need mental health care for your mental illness. A diet will not result in long term recovery. You may find short term success but if you don't fix the root problem it will keep coming back over and over and over to help you cope when things get hard. I've been in recovery for 11 months after struggling for 15 years. I didnt have recovery until i QUIT all diets and focused on my mental health. No diet can will be able to cure mental illness. Sorry to say. Finding a DBT or CBT therapy program is best for BED. If you can't get into a program there are books on amazon that cover DBT for binge eating disorder. There are also youtube channels and podcasts that can give you good information.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Can I point something out to you? You are prefacing you are so proud of yourself with its dumb and you hate doing it. The way we speak to and about ourselves can be very important when dealing with mental illness. Dialectics are a simple things we can observe and change. Your first sentence didn't need to exist in this case. You could have simply said "I #8217;ve gone 2 days without binging or restricting and I #8217;m so proud". Dont minimize your achievement with negative self talk. You are allowed to be proud and you should be proud. Its not dumb at all. For some people 1 meal not binging is an accomplishment so 2 days is fantastic. Dont minimize your achievements especially if you are proud of them. Combating those thoughts that make you feel the need to give yourself an insult before you compliment yourself could be really great for your mental health. So congrats! You have the right to be proud of it.</TEXT>

He can't afford to hire more teachers and make class sizes smaller to reduce risk, hospitals all over are laying off nurses in the lead up to a 2nd way, yet Ford can afford the salary of 500 nurses for schools where they can't put any of their actual skills to use because it doesn't take a registered nurse to tell a kid to go home if they're sick. As far as I know a lot of schools have not received their nurse yet but according to dougie, and his hundreds of thousands if not millions of dollars worth of advertisement, that's the plan.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I had no issue with dairy until a few years ago. It's pretty common for ppl to loose the ability to break down lactose as they age. Dairy is hard because there could be a few reasons its causing inflammation; the lactose, fat, or hormones. For me I thought it was the fat but I started buying lactose free cheese to see if it made a difference and it does seem to. Ive been eating lactose free cheese for a few months now and havent had any noticable related flaring compared to regular cheese so I guess for me its the lactose. Kind of trial an error i guess because I cant eat dairy free ice cream since it still has a lot of sugar and sugar is a trigger for me. As for the bloating in hands, feet, etc. I haven't particularly noticed that but inflammation can do wild things. The last time i had a major flare up the lympnodes in my neck were swollen for a week, that was scary. So its possible. For me if i notice swelling like that I usually attribute it too retaining water. In that case i try to reduce my sodium intake and drink plenty of water.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Sometimes I find it really hard to accept my emotional outbursts and issues are because of BPD. Sometimes I feel like its a fake diagnoses or a cop out to explain why im a difficult person (This is my own self-hate and not what I believe about others with BPD) but studies like this, though small, help me to see the reality that there is a difference with my brain and there really is a reason I can't regulate my emotions like others. I duno maybe it will help someone else.  #8203; "Using real-time brain imaging, a team of researchers have discovered that patients with Borderline Personality Disorder (BPD) are physically unable to regulate emotion. The findings, by Harold W. Koenigsberg, MD, professor of psychiatry at Mount Sinai School of Medicine suggest individuals with BPD are unable activate neurological networks that would help to control feelings. Using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), researchers viewed how the brains of people with BPD reacted to social and emotional stimuli. Koenigsberg found that when people with BPD attempted to control and reduce their reactions to disturbing emotional scenes, the anterior cingulate cortex and intraparetical sulci areas of the brain that are active in healthy people under the same conditions remained inactive in the BPD patients.  #8220;This research shows that BPD patients are not able to use those parts of the brain that healthy people use to help regulate their emotions, #8221; said Dr. Koenigsberg.  #8220;This may explain why their emotional reactions are so extreme. The biological underpinnings of the disordered emotional control systems are central to borderline pathology. Studying which areas of the brain function differently in patients with borderline personality disorder can lead to more targeted uses of [psychotherapy](https://psychcentral.com/psychotherapy/) and [medications](https://psychcentral.com/drugs/), and also provide a link to connect the genetic basis of the disorder. #8221;  #8203; [Brain scans clarify borderline personality disorder](https://psychcentral.com/news/2017/09/04/brain-scans-clarify-borderline-personality-disorder/8184.html)</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Doesnt matter though. Asymptomatic people spread it too. Thats the whole danger of this whole pandemic and in order to get a test you need to take off that mask and come in contact with others. As is most hospitals have completely separate buildings just for covid testing to stop any cross contamination. They are going to allow ppl who have come into contact with those who have tested positive with covid. Those ppl are high risk and they are inviting them into a general shopping area, asking them to take off their mask, asking them to preform a test that is high risk to the employee, asking them to touch their dirty mask and then allowing them go off and shop as normal without caution to what they are contaminating on their way out. Its nuts. How is it hospitals need to have contagion protocols and pharmacies allow potentially sick people to just walk in, interact with employees and customers, and touch whatever they want. It makes absolutely no sense. Guess im not going to shoppers anymore. Theyre just asking to become a covid hot spot.</TEXT>

I did a covid test at a hospital and could not have felt safer the only person i ever came into contact with was a nurse that was decked out in gear. In shoppers they wont have the same type of strict protocols because they cant. They are going to do testing in a back room that requires you to walk through the whole store, with other people who potential have covid and are there to be tested. Theyre guna have 1 small room to do it in with god knows what kind of ventilation, with someone who has probably just been trained on how to do everything. No thanks.</TEXT>

Why dont you imagine what 300 grave stones on your front lawn would look like and tell me that isnt terrifying. Pretty sure id be pretty terrifying if it was someone you knew.

My grandma lived until 87 with diabetes. I'm immunocompromised and have lived my whole life perfectly fine. In fact i get sick less often than most ppl i know but if I get covid im at a higher risk for death. Im Sorry that you think this way. These people are human with long lives to live and are being cut short with covid. Its not an excuse to ignore these numbers just because they had a preexisting condition. You can live with heart disease well into your senior years. You think everyone walking around with a pre-exisiting condition is on deaths door lmao. Do you know anything about modern medicine? You've got alot of misunderstood beliefs. These ppl did not have to die and its absurd to assume they would have regardless of covid</TEXT>

    <TITLE>Anyone here have, or suspect they may have Lupus?</TITLE>
    <DATE>2020-09-26 09:15:02</DATE>
    <TEXT>Apparently HS is linked to lupus. Ive always wondered if I have lupus. I often have red cheeks and on occassion have seen what looks like a butterfly rash. I duno if id call it a rash though, more like redness, but maybe thats all a rash is lol. I had it pretty intensely today which is why its sparked my curiosity again. Anyways i feel like a lot of symptoms overlap with HS and i know it's difficult to get diagnosed for any autoimmune disease but I was wondering if anyone here has been successfully diagnosed and if this is something i should peruse further. My symptoms are getting worse as i get older even though I've recovered alot from HS through diet change. When I do get a flare up not only is the HS bad but I am severely sick. Last time to the point my neck swelled up for a week. I'm anemic, photosensitive, have dry eyes, and have memory loss. I feel like these are all common conditions for other things too though. Its seems so general lol but I just want to be informed so i can get better treatment for myself if its out there and also so I know if I need to monitor myself more closely. Anyone suspect lupus and been diagnosed? If so what symptoms did you have and how hard was it to get a diagnoses?

    <TEXT>Dry eyes are common with lupus. Usually what happens with dry eyes are the glands get blocked and that's why your eyes cant produce as much moisture. Blocked glands can also lead to inflammation which will lead to styes etc. The best treatment is a warm compress over your eyes for 10 minutes. You can use a warm wash cloth or you can buy a bean bag eye mask to use. Start with 10 minutes a day. Trust me you will feel the difference immediately. Once youve done that a week or two you can start reducing it to a few times a week and then maybe once a week. The heat helps unclogged the glands so they can work properly. Cleaning your lids is another important step to help keep your eyes healthy. Cleaning your lash line with lid wipes or baby shampoo will stop them from getting clogged. Eye drops can help ease symptoms and help get that moisture back in your eye so they are good to use regularly but the heat and lid cleaning may stop that issue completely. Omega 3 fish oil supplements are also great for the eyes and inflammatory conditions . Ive worked in the eye care business for over 10 years. Worked with doctors, surgeon's and helped to treat patients. This is the advice we give our patients. If none of this helps there are prescription drops that can be prescribed but theyll tell you to try all this first.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Change 'look' to feel. Change 'shrink' to heal. When you have binge eating disorder focusing on weight and size is going to feed your binge eating. You have a mental illness that needs to be dealt with as such. Their is no diet in the world that can cure a mental illness. Therapy, mental health help, focusing on why you binge not what diet to go on is how you lose weight. To lose weight with BED you need to stop trying to lose weight. Take all this energy and determination you have and focus on getting better mentally. If you can do that you really will never look like that again because you may actually cure your illness instead of battling with it the rest of your life.</TEXT>

Not one wearing a mask. Ive been in absolute lock down since march because im immunocompromised . people are seeing the numbers skyrocket and still carry on like no big deal. Must be nice to not give a shit about other ppl. I was really hopeful at the end of summer I may actually be able to get outta my house and see ppl but lets get real. People spent the last few weeks of summer obviously getting together and the numbers are going up and they had plenty of options to meet outdoors. What do we think is going to happen when the cold weather comes, people still dont care, and are all hanging out indoors with each other. Not mention the holiday season is coming....I have no doubt a whole year of my life is going to be lost because humanity doesn't care for one another.

With the remarkable speed at which we are seeing positive tests escalate well be back at that percentage in no time If we don't intervene so yes technically we are at a lower case percentage right now, but the rate at which it is climbing is alarming. Not to mention ICUs will not be able to handle the load if we go above what we were at before. We can't ignore the risk just because we got through it last time.

    <TEXT>Yeah i think in both cases its 100% the owners lack of training. German Shepard's can be some of the most well behaved dogs. I mean that's their thing lol. A well trained german shepard LIVES to please their owners but no dog comes perfectly trained you have to put in the work regardless of breed. I think larger dogs like huskies or German Shepard's can be a little more scary if they aren't trained and have behavioural issues because they are bigger and intimidating but german Shepard's especially are incredibly trainable so if you see a misbehaved German Shepard that's an owner problem for sure. I think huskies Can have a bit of a trouble maker vibe lol. I myself wouldn't own a husky as they can be quite loud, demanding, dramatic lmao. They may be a little harder to train but not anymore than other high energy breeds soooo yeah I would say dont blame the breed because these dogs are quite trainable dogs. I lived with someone who had a pure bred german Shepard . She did no training WHAT so ever with her dog. Kept it in a small apartment all day, took it on like 5-10 minute strolls a day. I mean could you blame a dog like that, that has no training, no stimuli, no exercise, to behave well? Lol. You see the dog and assume its wild but when you see the circumstances you realize why the dog is like that. I started taking the dog on walks and by the 3rd walk I already had her trained to not pull on the leash. I mean they are so smart but if shes never asked to do it how would she know that's whats expected. It's a shame really. A bunch of lazy people or at the very least uninformed ppl who have no business owning a dog give the breeds a bad rap.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I lived with a girl who spent thousands of dollars on a pure bred German Shepard that was actually shipped from Germany lmao. This giant dog sat in a small apartment all day, got no training, and walks consisted of around the block and to a small park across the street. I mean what is the point? Lol. It's like she got the dog just to tell everyone its pure bred from germany but didn't actually live a lifestyle appropriate for a big, active , dog like that. I took the poor dog on a hike through the forest once and the dog was so tired after an hour of walking it was practically limping by the time we got home. That's how unfit the dog was. It was heart wrenching. The dog was a menace because it was never trained. It only took me 3 walks to train her to not pull on a leash. She was smart as hell but would never reach her potential because the owner cared more about some status symbol than what the dog actually needed.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>DBT is going to be the best therapy for you. Recovery is a journey for most people. Ive done the full DBT program twice now and before that a CBT program along with some in patient and hospital programs. Ive definitely gotten better with this round of DBT. Some would say remission. I think a lot of things have to fall in place to find remission. Its not just about therapy and medication a lot can do with where you are in life, what's your mental outlook on things, who are your facilitators in the program etc. I say this because the first time I did the DBT program I did find it to be helpful but I still didn't recover. There were still a lot of factors/stressors in my life that were holding me back from recovery that I didnt realize. This round of DBT happened after kind of a rock bottom. I was back home because I was homeless, no job, no friends, and bankrupt. Though that seems like a tough scenario to get better in, it actually changed my perspective on a lot of things. So much so I was more open than ever to learning and getting better. I could also solely focus on my mental health and frankly i just worked better with the therapist i had on this team compared to the others. Im not saying it takes a long hard road like it did for me but im just saying everyone has their own journey. You could be in the best DBT program with the best therapist but your life circumstances, mental focus, or whatever isn't in line at this time which is why it could take a little while to figure it all out. We also get wiser with age so I think its realistic to not expect to find remission right away. BPD is known as a very up and down type of illness. The road to recovery is often very wavy and that's okay. We learn from these ups and down. For medication wellbutrin has worked well for me. Little side effects and keeps my major depressive symptoms at bay. I did well on lamotrigine for a while as well but eventually it stopped working and I'm pretty sure i gained massive weight from it. Antipsychotics are the absolute worst! Ive heard a lot of ppl say similar things on here. My general sense is they arent right for BPD but that's just what i gather. As for dating I personally have taken a break from dating about 5 or 6 years now. Ive done so because i was really sick for a long time and relationships are major stressors for me and always made me sicker so I decided if i was going to get better I need to get better on my own. I also knew id never be in a healthy relationship anyways if i didn't get better so there was no point for me to try while still sick. I dont think you should think about it as an all or nothing thing. Im either going to date or not date. I think if you believe its best to avoid it for now for your mental health thats okay. Allow yourself to heal and to learn so hopefully you can take that knowledge into your next relationship but if you live in absolutes like I cannot date it may be a hard rule to live by and could just add to your suffering. Maybe dont seek it out for now to focus on yourself but also don't push away people if they bring you joy or peace.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>My mom got me a Bissell BarkBath for my bday and ive actually used it quite a lot since she cant get regular groomings right now. Its not perfect but it works to keep her smelling fresh. She'll still need a proper grooming but waaaay less often than before. It works like a couch cleaner lol but for dogs. The handle sprays water and shampoo and sucks it up at the same time. So they arent soaking wet. The bissell comes with no rinse shampoo so even if you don't get it all off its okay. I bathe her right in our livingroom with a few towels laid down. It's honestly so much easier than hauling her into the bathtub lol. Shes a mixed breed but has hair similar to a golden retriever just a little shorter. The wand works well with this type of hair in my opinion. If you buy it on amazon you could always return if it doesnt work. Just a suggestion. Ive saved a lot of money in groomings being able to bathe her between full cuts. I got the black and green one which is cheaper than the newer one they have. I got mine on amazon I think it was like $100. Not bad considering 1 grooming for her costs me $75</TEXT>

    <TEXT>A diet makes binge eating disorder worse. Binge eating is a mental illness. It's not about the food your eating its why your eating it and why you lose control when eating it. If you dont fix the mental health part you may lose weight in the short term but chances are you will gain it back when you get in hard place in life. This is because most of us use food as a coping mechanism. If you dont learn effective coping mechanisms you will continue to use food as your go to which means a diet won't help you because you will eventually go back to food. If you want to loose weight permanently it means putting the focus on the source of the mental illness and not the symptoms. Binging is a symptom of a greater problem. I would suggest putting this new found determination to work on your mental health. If you can find a dbt or cbt program one that deals with binge eating is best but these programs are good in their own too. If thats not an option look into DBT for binge eating disorders. You can find books, websites, podcasts, and youtube channel about this. Most people start recovery by actually quitting dieting, quitting weighing themselves, and quitting calorie counting etc. This is because all these things are very triggering for our binge eating disorder. When we dont reach our goals and see it as a "failure" it leads to more binging because a lot of us have self esteem and self image issues, and without healthy coping mechanisms we binge to cope with that failure. Basically by trying not to binge it leads to more binging. Many of us have gone on diet after diet and there is a reason it never sticks. Its not willpower its because we arent addressing the actual issue. Which is mental illness. If you want to lose weight and lose weight for good a diet is the opposite of what you need. You actually need to stop trying to lose weight to lose weight. Focus in your mental health, beat binge eating disorder, and the weight will fall of naturally. Ive lost 85 pounds and counting in under a year without diet or exercise. Recovering from BED was all that needed to happen for the weight to fall off. I spent the past year focusing on my mental health through DBT. As my suffering reduced so did my binge urges and my urges to eat shitty food. I now eat all kinds of foods but with the ability to eat it in moderation. I finally feel free and it started with me promising never to diet again.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Lol. It's totally appropriate because people under 40 are the demographic that has been loudest in claiming non existence or over reacctions of the illness. The news is trying to prove the point to these people that its here and you guys are getting sick too so smarten up. Its also to say your social interactions are making it worse. It is certainly more common to come from social interactions than work or else we would be hearing of outbreaks in thousands of workplaces which haven't been the case. Most of them are from businesses that are based around social interaction ( like bars) and private events like birthday parties, weddings, etc. And its this age group that continue to disobey the laws and common sense. I am in my 30s and i think its totally deserved. I have TONS of friends on my facebook that never stopped hanging out and socializing. They're having get togethers, cottage weekends, house parties, roadtrips. None of them are taking it seriously and these are ppl 28-36, so yeah its deserved.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>1. I do it as a hobby. I got into it because my friend and I were on vacation. She had scuba dived before and we were looking for something to do. I said i would be interested in trying it and thats all it took to fall in love! 2. I would say any adventurous activity can be dangerous but if we follow our training and safety protocols it's pretty safe. Some dangers you can face are weather/ocean currents ( they can be strong so we have to make sure we are informed and don't dive when the conditions aren't good), equipment failure ( sometimes equipment can fail this is why its important to train for those scenarios and check your gear properly before starting your dive), wildlife ( you shouldn't be interfering with marine life. For the most part if you just observe and leave them be they will let you be but when going into a wild environment with wild animals there will always be some risk of an animal reacting in a defensive way) 3. Scuba diving is very fun!! The funnest part is being part of another world. Seeing animals in their natural habitat acting like your just one of them is so cool! There really is no thrill like a turtle, or stingray, or shark swimming by you. Its a rush. It's also fun because you just never know what you're going to see. It's always a surprise. You also get to ride in boats which is fun, male new friends, and be part of a community with a lot of cool interesting people. 4. When water is too warm, corals will expel the algae living in their tissues causing the coral to turn completely white. This is called coral bleaching. When a coral bleaches, it is not dead. Corals can survive a bleaching event, but they are under more stress and are subject to mortality 5. I think every creature has it's own unique intelligence but if we are talking about intelligence like humans problem solving, social, etc. I would say dolphins, orcas, whales, seals, octopus, are the ones ive come across that we're very impressive with their skills. 6. Underwater plants provide food, oxygen, and shelter. 7. I thought it would be really cool to see what was living in the water. 8. I think marine animals can be similar to land animals. Most animals can form a bond with another animal or human. Whether it's because you offer them food or they are simply curious by you I think it is possible for certain marine animals to form a connection with you. 9. I've been lucky enough to not have seen any distressed marine animals so I have never saved an animal is the water but would absolutely try to if I saw one. We do often clean up trash if we come by it in the ocean. Plastic and fishing lines are common to find and animals can die from eating or getting trapped within them so id like to think im helping them out by removing it from the ocean. 10. Yes I have. Jellyfish, stingrays, lionfish, and puffer fish i have seen a lot in the ocean. They can all be poisonous to humans. Like any other animals if you stay away from them they will likely stay away from you. I am happy to say i have never been stung by any of these animals. They are beautiful to watch though!. 11. For me the best experiences are when I see the big animals. On one dive we were absolutely surrounded by sharks 30 or more we saw on our dive. It was intense but thrilling. The sharks were very docile but just the thrill of being in that environment was so cool.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I know that this is frustrating for people but at this point everyone knows what they are suppose to do. We honestly shouldnt need a politician to tell us how not to spread a deadly virus. Wear a mask, social distance, don't socialize in groups, wash your hands. Its pretty damn simple and honestly pretty sad that people cant do these super simple things on their own. It's ridiculous. I understood it at the beginning because it was new and needed to be shown how serious it was but we're in our second wave now. Everyone knows ( or should know) what works so just got damn do it people. I know why government intervention is needed. Im not clueless to the assholes in the population but common man, it's so freaking simple.</TEXT>

Its actually best case scenario ( what we are projected to hit, which means its practically guaranteed to happen) as said by chief medical officer and minister of health.

    <TEXT>Projected means this is whats happening. The numbers always lag behind what's actually going on. 1000/day is almost guaranteed at this point due to the lag in testing, the stats of rising infections, and the time it takes to show symptoms and get tested. The closures won't have an effect on numbers for at least 3 weeks. So maybe well see the effect of closures in November but October Is pretty much a done deal. So yeah 1000/day is pretty realistic for October.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>No, those are projected numbers. Projected numbers means given the data we have right now this is what we will see in october. We can't stop anything at this point to stop these numbers in October. Whats done is done. The people that are sick are sick and their symptoms and tests will be coming into the numbers this month which is why 1000/day is an almost guaranteed. Could we turn things around for November and December? Sure. But october numbers are not preventable anymore.</TEXT>

This is where we are and what we are most likely going to see. You really need to accept the reality lol. October is done and over. If we wanted to fix october ppl needed to smarten up in september. Lets hope people smarten up now so we have a better November but October is going to be a crapshoot. Whats done is done</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Its not just what worked for me its what works with most successful recoveries. Of course there can be other ways to get better but this is the proven, researched, and most used by health professionals for a reason. If someone finds help other ways that's great but dieting is often to the detriment of the person with an ED. I'm not blindly encouraging her because I actually care to help her. I see a problematic behaviour that typically leads to worsening of symptoms and I want to make her aware of that in case she wasn't aware. She has the ability to ignore my advice if she wants but I'm not going to go on a anorexia forum and encourage diets just like I'm not going to do that here. Its generally a bad idea. BED is an eating disorder for a reason it has the same mental health issues related to it that anorexia and bulimia have. Its important on this forum to know that. Society has told us that if we are fat its because we like food to much and have no will power. I'm trying to create awareness around the fact that this is not a willpower issue. This is a mental health issue. The eating part is secondary to the mental health part. You can choose to ignore what i say if you like, that's okay, but these are the facts we know about eating disorders. I'm sorry, but I will not encourage someone with an eating disorder to engage in a known behaviour that worsens eating disorder. I think it's wonderful people on here are encouraging but I think knowledge is power and thats my way of encouraging her. Maybe something I say will allow for a perspective change. A change that could lead to recovery. Encouraging a behaviour thats clearly been done in the past and is a known trigger is not helpful in my opinion.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I think there are a lot of ways to go about it and alot of different methods. I can certainly see how it gets confusing. All i was told about for the longest time was intuitive eating and that did absolutely nothing for me. For me i think it was the fact that intuitive eating still has to do with the food. Personally i had to take all the focus off of the food and my weight. I focused soley on my mental health through DBT therapy. This therapy helped me notice my emotions, which helped me linked my emotions to my eating. And gave me ways to better cope with my emotions, which helped with binge urges. When it came to what I ate I changed the focus from high cal foods, fat foods, good foods, bad foods. To simply how does the food make me feel... Meaning i looked at my health issues acne, stomach issues, fatigue, and focused on what i needed to eat to make these issues better. It allowed me to change up my food to a healthier diet without going on a "diet" because it had nothing to do with weight-loss and wasn't as strict. If i ate food i was trying to avoid it wasn't a big deal but maybe i would get stomach cramps and that was kind of my incentive to not eat shit food. I wanted to feel good. When I changed my perspective it was no longer about my weight it was about my health and i duno, that didnt cause any binge urges. It just worked for me. Everyone has their own way of figuring it out. Sometimes it can take a long time to know what that looks like for you. I was just making the point that going on a diet for the purpose of weight-loss is almost always going to lead right back to where you start. Doesn't mean all diets are evil but with a mental illness the intention behind it matters. If its a diet with the intention of weight-loss or body image, it triggers our illness and leads down the typical road.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>If you dont weigh yourself you dont know. Weighing yourself is a trigger to binging. It gives instant anxiety and depression. On the flip side if you loose weight it can give instant gratification which isnt good either. That's a lot of power your giving to a scale. Its better to go off of how you feel. If you feel bloated or heavy then you still know you ate too much but its not measured. It allows you to become more intune with your body instead of allowing a scale to determine your mood for the day. Throw away the scale. In the realm of eating disorders a scale is a hindrance, a problematic behaviour, some even consider it self harm.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>The thing is, is everyone is human. He had a hard week. He knew jury was coming up and he started freaking out cause he missed home. He doesnt have the same support system he had last time, he doesn't like the idea of lying and scheming to win, and he could see the unfair treatment of the POC in the house. Thats alot of stuff to deal with, with no one to talk about it to and I know everyone else is in the same situation but I dont blame him at all for that week. Hes a sensitive guy with obvious anxiety. He really didnt change the course of the game. He just hurt himself if anything. It is what it is. We could never know what was truly going on for him and I think we should have some empathy to the situation. He got his head in the game now. He seems to be back to comp beast tyler. I am absolutely still rooting for him. Depression and anxiety is never going to be a reason i turn my back on someone I like. Never.</TEXT>

The only vote he's probably guaranteed out of those guys is david, but we know hes a wild card. Anyone else who gets into jury from the 6 remaining will vote for the other person sitting beside him unless its christmas. Against Nicole he looses Against Cody he looses Against Memphis... He probably looses but maybe he has a chance Against enzo he probably looses ( bitter jurors) But against Christmas... They all pretty much don't like her so she is actually the safest bet for him to win the money. Its unfortunate that he's been linked to her because hes got a big target on his back now but if they can make it to the end, no way she gets votes. He'll win Edit. Ahh i see you said he would win against her lol. Im a big tyler fan. I want him to win. If that mean christmas needs to sit beside him for that to happen im okay with it.</TEXT>

The reason vyvanse is working is mostly due to the appetite suppression side effect. SSRIs work to give you a chemical that may be needed. Unless you have adhd vyvanse is simply "working" because the side effect are causing you not to eat. SSRIs may actually solve a problem of chemical imbalance. Vyvanse doesn't actually solve anything if being used just for BED. BED is a symptom of mental health issues. The most successful treatment is therapy. Your doctor wants to use vyvanse as an aid thats fine but it's not the same way antidepressants work.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I found this kind of train of thought was the start to my recovery. The fact that it was good food, bad food. Not just food. The fact that I was either dieting or binging on whatever i want... Not just eating. When we're kids we just eat lol. There was a point in our lives where we just ate food. A sandwich, soup, salad, whatever was for dinner we just ate and me personally I was at a healthy weight when I was a kid. Regardless of if what my mom fed me was considered "healthy" or not. I was at a normal weight. Which made me realize it is possible to be at a healthy weight without a diet. I realized I need to bring it back to just food. Re-teach myself how to eat normally. Like human beings are suppose to eat lol. I eat when im hungry, i eat what i like, and i eat whats good for me. It doesn't have to be either , or. All these things can coexist together at the same time.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Unfortunately there are a lot of shitty health care workers out there and she clearly has no idea what shes talking about. First of all the moment a therapist tries to diagnose you, thats a red flag. They are not qualified to do so which is why they are not suppose to. 2nd I am diagnosed BPD I do not abuse drugs or alcohol and I've definitely had symptoms of BPD since 13 years old. 18 is more than old enough to get a proper diagnoses. A therapist more than anyone should know there is a difference between the regular teenage stresses of growing up and a mental illness. Frankly this therapist seems like shes not knowledgable and I would not take any diagnoses seriously from her. If shes a therapist and shes minimizing your experience you should also find a new therapist. Therapists are suppose to validate you and your experience. That's like therapy 101 lol. So unprofessional.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Yes. Truthfully though there is no way I would have been able to accomplish moderation if I wasn't getting proper mental health help. If people are using food as a way to cope with their emotions and aren't learning other skills I think it would be incredibly hard to not binge since at this point its not about the food its just a coping mechanism. Therapy and skills are so important to recovery. Once you've got some good skills under your belt then the food stuff becomes so much easier to figure out.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>It takes a long time for our brain to build new pathways. These feelings of shame are just lingering from your disordered eating days. Don't ignore them but also don't over think them. When a judgemental thought comes up just stop and say " I just had a judgemental thought" and move on. Acknowledging the thought but not allowing yourself to dissect it is a helpful skill to help you realize, thoughts aren't facts. Just because your brain says something to you doesn't mean its true. Allowing yourself to hear it, acknowledge it, but move forward can help separate yourself from whats true and whats simply just a thought. Another skill you can use is to check the facts. If your brain says "you have no will power for ordering out". Ask yourself "is this true". Well, no its not. I've been binge free for 8 months, ive done very well. Eating a few things does not mean im relapsing. It means im eating normally. Validating yourself like this can also help those little thoughts quiet down. The hardest part of BED is trying to figure out what normal eating looks like and normal eating means having things you enjoy. Especially on your birthday. Thats as normal as it gets lol. Enjoy yourself. Allow yourself to eat and just try to remind yourself of all your progress and eating some yummy food around your birthday is part of that progress.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Some people are just different. Alcoholics wonder how people can have a few drinks and then go home. Drug addicts wonder how someone could do drugs a few times and then decide to stop. Our drug of choice was food. All these addictions surround mental illness and not everyone has a mental illness. Though it's alot harder to wrap your head around food because everyone eats food not everyone suffers from mental health issues and at the core of it BED is a mental health issue. That's why some people just see it as food. They haven't connected food to their mental health. Just like we don't connect drinking to our mental health but others do. I think eventually though, it will start to normalize. Im 11 months in and though i still have thoughts like you food really is consuming less of my time than it used to.</TEXT>

Chances are the other kids tried gymnastics too and didnt like it or are maybe still involved just not at graces level. I was the one in my family who reached a high level in a sport. Training almost everyday and travelling a lot. My brother was put into ALOT of activities as a kid too but he decided to drop them all. Am I or my parents suppose to be punished for my brothers uninterest in sports because now they spend a lot of money and time on me? Uh no because they gave him the exact same opportunity as me and he as an individual decided not to peruse it. I am sure if one of graces siblings reached elite level they would find a way to pay for them too. You have no idea what's going on in this family other than what graces mom has said which is they all do activities. Maybe the other kids hate competition, maybe they're more creative or enjoy maths more. Maybe theyre drama students or online gamers You have no fucking idea so giving us your assumptions makes you look like an ass to be frank.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Youre projecting your childhood issues onto this family which could be the furthest thing from how any of these siblings actually feel. Graces moms twitter was probably specifically created for graces career. When youre in the spotlight like this there are certain requirements that have to be done and its possible that her mom created the account so she could control the narrative about grace on social media, for all we know its a requirement at that high of a level. You have no idea so dont speculate. Its possible she has a private account with just her family that she posts about all the other kids. You dont know so dont speculate. You also have no idea what these other kids are into. Grace enjoyed gymnastics and accomplished a high level chances are the other kids tried it too and are either doing it but at a low level or tried it and didnt enjoy it. You dont know so dont speculate. For all we know her siblings are more artistic. Maybe theyre in drama club and they really enjoy that so the parents attend a bunch of play to support that child and thats what that child wants. Just because it doesnt take up 6 days a week, tons of money, and travel, doesnt mean that kid isnt absolutely happy that they are doing what they love in drama club and their parents support them by coming to their plays. You dont know so dont speculate. Maybe another child is a huge gamer. Hates sports. Just wants video games to play with all day. Thats what they enjoy and thats all they ask for and they are provided with that. You dont know so dont speculate. Maybe because of graces elite status these kids get opportunities they never would have ( going to other countries to watch her). Maybe they are happy that grace is at this level because they get a chance to travel and do cool things. You dont know so dont speculate. I was in a very similar situation as grace. My family spent a lot of time and money on me because i was an elite in my sport. They gave my sibling ALL the same opportunities as me in sports but they didnt like it. They liked to draw and play video games and they were happy with that life. I shouldnt have been punished because my sibling didnt want to be an elite athlete and my parents shouldn't feel bad because they are giving what my sibling wants. They just want video games and drawing tools. Well he got it. What are they suppose to do? Force him into a sport so we have equal schedules and budgets? It's ridiculous.

    <TITLE>Okay... Starting to understand the Nicole hate</TITLE>
    <DATE>2020-10-10 14:12:48</DATE>
    <TEXT>I've been defending Nicole in this sub not because I like her but because I thought the hate was extreme. I was saying not liking her personality or gameplay is one thing but the obsessive high level of hate was crazy. Now I'm certainly still not at that level of hate for her BUT catching up on the live feeds from this week and this girl really is such a hater. Like I think in this case, hate is breeding hate. It's one thing to be mad at ppl for a game move but she's taking it to a level of ridiculousness. Her comments about Tyler and Christmas are over the top and unwarranted. She takes it so personally, it's insane. Questioning his AFP win? Like wtf is that? Why is that necessary? I think when you're hateful like that you cant be surprised when you get hate back and though I feel bad for anyone on this show because social media is cruel, she really has done it to herself. I'm done defending her. She just can't stop talking shit, shes got hate in her heart and it is not a good look. Hope she gets the help she needs because this obsessive behavior is seriously troubling. Edit: I want to point out that I am mostly talking about Nicole's private moments. Her talking to the mic or camera while alone. Not her group talks because everyone talks shit so whos to say what they really believe but her private moments talking into the mic where shes just so clearly filled with disdain and hate. Moments that don't require strategy, it's just her own thoughts. This is what's alarming me because those are obviously what shes truly thinking in the moment and it's over the top. I haven't heard many ppl speak like that privately but we've heard it ALOT from Nicole and that's what's started to open my eyes to her true character. I honestly feel for Nicole. I'm saying im understanding the hate not that I hate her but she needs help. She turns everyone that doesn't act her way into an enemy and that is not healthy behavior.</TEXT>

With janelle I did think she was obsessed but it wasnt like janelle wasnt talking about her either so even though Nicole was overboard i could see why she and janelle had issues and could understand why she was acting the way she waseven though I agree it was a lot. With Tyler hes been nothing but nice to Nicole personally. Yes he tried to get her out but that was strictly game move. Hes always been nice to her and didnt talk shit personally about her to others. Hes a nice decent guy and she knows that so for her to be calling him a joke, and attacking him personally is WAY overboard considering hes been nothing but nice and respectful to her. That why ppl are upset. Janelle throws shade. Thats Janelle's character. Y'all are blind if you think Nicole was solo in the shade throwing but Tyler didnt do anything personally to Nicole to warrant such hate from her and for that matter either did Christmas. Instead of just being sad because you were targeted as a player she turns hateful and attacks ppls personal character who dont deserve it. That's what made me realized the hype is real. I could find some understanding in the Janelle issue I cant with the Tyler.</TEXT>

Thats showing her true colours. Thats what Nicole thinks and it's not pretty. Ive never heard Tyler talk to the camera and call someone "a joke". In those private moments you can see the uncalled for hate. That's what's alarming me. In Codys private moments hes talking about houseguests from a game stand point. Hes telling us he feels bad but hes saying maybe he doesnt trust them. Hes not calling them disgusting. Theres a big difference and its pretty prevalent when we see these private moments.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Pretty sure I said I did not hate Nicole more than once. I said I was starting to understand it. I agree the house is hard however, we do see 20 other house guests in the same situation that don't resort to hate when they are stressed. I think if someone's default reaction to stress is to turn it outwards to other people it makes sense they are going to receive some hate right back. Hate breeds hate and though I do not hate her because I don't know her and mentioned pretty clearly I think the hate online is excessive it's easy to see why people react the way they do. They feel her hate is unwarranted and mostly unprovoked by respectful house guests. Everyone is facing stressors in there and though everyone is entitled to handle stress in their own way turning it outward onto others as Nicole does is unhealthy and obviously unlikeable. This is a forum for player discussion and I don't think I have displayed any unhealthy behavior in discussing a player. If you see my comments I've been pretty respectful of Nicole and haven't said anything that isn't true.</TEXT>

She's showing pretty clear problematic thinking patterns. Would you rather me just call her a bitch? Lol. I rather show so empathy. I can see she has some problematic thinking problems that's leading her to this kind of behaviour. I choose not to call her a bitch like everyone else because it doesn't actually say anything its just a put down. By acknowledging the cause of her behaviour maybe we can humanize her a bit and instead of her being just a villain we can see her as someone who just needs some help and guidance. Personally I think that's a lot less cringy than me just throwing some random mean label on her... But if you don't like the comment luckily you can scroll on by.</TEXT>

There is a difference between being upset about a situation and what she does which is turn hateful. Her initial emotion is likely sadness. Shes hurt but she seems to turn that into anger and that's not a great way to deal with those emotions. She gets very personal, and mean, and her level of disdain doesnt actually fit the situation thats happening. Everyone reacts differently to stress and she obviously turns it outwards to other ppl but she needs to realize if thats how shes deciding to handle it, its going to bite her in the ass because shes going to be labeled a mean girl. Everyone in that house has the right to get mad about it I am just not a fan of how hateful she is to these ppl in her personal moments especially because everyone in the house has been really respectful to her. She has said some very personally things about them that I feel was over the line. Everyone in there is in the same situation and though everyone handles things differently i do feel like theres been a stark contrast with how she chooses to handle stress and that's where the fans hate is coming from.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Its really awful when you meet someone you are a fan of and they dont meet your expectations. Its understandable you felt disappointed. It also takes a lot of courage to go up to someone like that so when they kind of brush it off as a bother I bet that's hurtful. It sucks that happened to you. Thats why they say dont meet your heros hahaha. Not that she was a hero but I think we can see from her behaviour on the show she isn't very aware of others feelings. Shes pretty self involved so just know that, thats on her, and reflects poorly on her not on you. Fans like you are why she has the life she does so its ashame she choose not to be appreciative that day.</TEXT>

    <TITLE>After months of recovery overeating again on Thanksgiving proved to me BED was self harm.</TITLE>
    <DATE>2020-10-13 03:49:19</DATE>
    <TEXT>I've been in recovery almost a year now and though I've had a few slip ups I haven't binged to the point I used to. Today is Canadian Thanksgiving and I decided to let myself enjoy like everyone else does. I didn't binge because I was in complete control of what I was eating but I did eat more than I normally do and a food that I have not eaten in a very long time. I am uncomfortably bloated, Im dehydrated, I have a headache, I feel sick, I feel anxious, I feel down, and I can't find a comfortable position to lay or sit in. Im now trying to go to sleep with all of this discomfort wondering how the hell I did this to myself every single day for years. It made me realize that at the heart of this disorder it is absolutely a self harm tactic. There is no other way to describe how I put myself through this torture everyday like it was normal other than some part of me wanted to be in pain. People who wonder how "normal" people dont binge on food. How they can control portions and stop when their full. It's because of this. Its because over eating makes ppl feel sick. Those that don't have mental health issue don't like to feel sick so they stop. If food is a form of self harm for us it makes sense we continue to keep going even though we know its going to cause us pain. Maybe we do it because it causes us pain. It sucks man. Focus on the mental health part. Food really doesnt control my life and though i sometimes still have days like this where I over eat I ALWAYS regret it and it reminds me why food isnt as amazing as I once thought it was. I ate a medium pizza tonight and though I used to eat ALOT more on my binges this was way too much for me tonight. I genuinely enjoy my homemade chicken souvlaki more than I did this pizza and maybe that's how I know im in recovery lol.</TEXT>

    <DATE>2020-10-18 04:56:13</DATE>
    <TEXT>These are the days when all this body positive, confident in your own body stuff just seems like total bullshit. How am I suppose to be confident when its proven ppl just see me as a fat person. It's like the automatic insult is to call me fat and they say it like "how dare you say anything to me you're fat". I feel like a second class citizen and what hurts the most is how far ive come just to have the same insult hurled at me a year later and 90lbs down. I gained weight because i was sick. I was sick with this, i was sick with other mental illnesses, and I was sick with a chronic health condition. This along with medicine skyrocketed my weight to 300lbs in just a few years. Ive been in recovery coming up a year now. Im at 213lbs now and though yes, i understand that is still obese. It is FAR away from where I was. I was honestly really starting to build confidence in myself. Clothes are actually falling off of me. I can see my waist again. I can actually take a decent selfie again lol and I was starting to literally walk with my head held high again. Than this woman reminds me what I really look like. Just some fat person. She doesn't know how fat I used to be but it doesn't matter cause im still just another fat person. Sad thing is its the 2nd time in the last few months a stranger has called me fat. At least the first person did it unintentionally this one tried to tell me if I dieted and wasnt fat I wouldn't get sick with covid ( she was a real peice of work. So dont even want to get into the covid part of it) but i just thought I am on a healthy fucking diet! Ive lost a ton of weight! Its infuriating she knows nothing about me and says that because its the most obvious insult she can think of. It makes me so upset that, thats the first place someone goes. Ive worked fucking hard for the last year and people still see me as a lazy, unhealthy, fat person and im honestly really hurt and really sad about it. Makes me want to hide away in my home again like i used to. People are cruel. I just needed to rant because no one else I know as ever been called fat by a stranger so they don't exactly empathize.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I get what you are saying but being in my 30s having gone through being sexual harassed and abused multiple times by men in my life I can say it's probably coming from a place of love and concern because with my history I would probably be the same way with my child. Who knows maybe your mom had some bad experiences too. In a perfect world it would be nice for women to be able to wear what ever they want and be treated like equals but I am very sorry to say that still isnt the case and even if your mom brought you and your brother up with these values it doesnt mean everyone else was brought up with the same values. I think it is overboard to not let you wear shorts in the house but the point I am trying to make is to maybe give your mom a bit of a break because you don't quite know what's leading to her decision. Honestly, I think the best way to sort this out is sit down and have a real conversation about it. Don't come in attacking but just sit down and ask. "I would really like to know your reasoning behind thinking woman shouldn't wear shorts in their own homes because I don't really understand it but would love to understand your perspective on it".</TEXT>

We have absolutely no way of knowing how a dog thinks or what it feels so even though you are upset and expect your other dog to be upset to I would try to let that go because they are a different species than us and will not compute this in the same way we do. Let the dog be a dog. Whatever grieving or not grieving may look like that's what comes natural to them and that's okay. I had 4 cats at one time and none of them bated an eye when one would pass away. Maybe it really affected them and we didn't know but it kind of just is what it is. Some dogs may be more expressive than others or have a better understanding than others and thats why you see stories of dogs grieving but thats not going to be true for all dogs.</TEXT>

    <TITLE>YSK: Visine eye drops are not lubricating eye drops and if used regularly are actually bad for your eyes.</TITLE>
    <DATE>2020-10-18 16:21:19</DATE>
    <TEXT>Why YSK: Visine could be causing you more harm than good by temporarily fixing the issue of red eyes without actually addressing the underlining problems. Visine is, fundamentally, a decongestant. Redness in your eyes can be caused by swollen and congested blood vessels; these blood vessels, when irritated, become #160;filled with blood and get backed up. Visine solves the problem by causing the affected blood vessels to artificially constrict. The active ingredients in Visine cause blood vessels to physically shrink. This accomplishes the immediate goal of lessening the eye #8217;s redness, however, as the medication eventually wears off, a phenomenon known to eye doctors as  #8220;rebound redness #8221; may occur, which makes the initial problem that much worse. In fact, over a prolonged period of continuous Visine usage, the rebound redness may actually become the default condition of the patient #8217;s eyes. It #8217;s true: Visine can permanently imprint on your eyes the very condition that it was originally intended to improve. This is because Visine makes a basic mistake: it temporarily addresses the patient #8217;s symptom (redness) without adequately solving the underlying cause (which may vary). And it can be even worse for contact lens wearers, because Visine can also dilate a patient #8217;s pupils when used too much, too often. Contact lens wearers may become increasingly sensitive to light and experience blurry vision. If you are looking for dry eye relief be sure to look for "Artificial Tears" not "Red Eye Treatment". Artificial tears are used to lubricate the eye where red eye treatment just constrict the blood vessels. Warm compress on the eyes, lid washes, and fish oil supplements are even better ways to address and possibly solve red, itchy eyes without causing harm. *I've worked in the eye care industry for 10 years and it's very common for people to think Visine is just a regular eyedrop because their marketing has been very successful but has lacked the proper education on how the drop actually works.

    <TEXT>That's a good question! It's common for our eyes to create an abundance of tears when our eyes are irritated so even though the problem may feel like you have too much lubrication the cause is often due to the opposite. One of the most common causes of watery eyes are dryness. Your eyes are creating an overload of tears because your eyes arent lubricated properly. In this case I would start using an artificial tear regularly to try to build up that moisture again. I am in Canada so I don't know if we have the same brands but Refresh and Systane are the ones I enjoy using. Another common issue with watery eyes are your glands may be blocked. This can happen really easily from our skin oils or makeup. When the glands are blocked they aren't able to lubricate our eyes properly. This typically causes dry eye and may even cause other issues likes styes and bacteria which will cause watery eyes too. There are a few things you can do to make sure your glands are working as they should. 1) use a warm compress. This will help open up the glands so they can work properly. 2) Make sure to wash your face at night to remove those oils, you can buy a lid cleaner so you can clean properly around the lash line and ensure nothing is getting trapped 3) Get an artificial tear to help relieve the symptom of dry eyes while you are working on the cause of it. 4)Taking fish oil supplements are a natural way to help combat dry eyes. The third thing could be allergies. Allergies often cause watery, itchy eyes. Its best to try to figure out your allergy and avoid it but if that's not an option using allergy drops can help temporarily but again they are a drop that you have to be cautious using. Best to try a regular artificial tear first and the steps above to see if that relives some issues. If its allergies taking a regular antihistamine may help as well. Hope that helps!</TEXT>

    <TEXT>It depends on the cause of the redness. If you have chronic redness you should really see an optometrist because there could be an underlying health issue there. Not saying there is but there are potential serious diseases and conditions that can cause chronic red eye. Until then I would definitely try using an artifical tear regularly. I would also try a warm compress regularly until you feel some relief happening. They sell bean bag masks on amazon that are great for that. Making sure you wash your lids and lash line well. Wash your lids with either a lid wash or a gentle baby shampoo. Taking fish oil supplements are great for eye health, so is eating food rich in vitamin A. Trying to figure out if anything triggers the red eye to work out if it could be an allergy. Maybe keep notes of everytime you notice the red eye is worse and write down what you did before, what you handled, what you ate, what the allergy report is for the day, etc. to see if there is a pattern. Most importantly if you are a regular user of redness eyedrops stop because its probably making it worse ESP if you have a condition thats causing it the eyedrops could cause damage.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Yeah Visine is especially not good for contact lens wearers but I will point out that even though contact lens solution ultimately goes in your eye it is not designed to hydrate your eye and can cause more harm than good even if it feels good. Contact lens solutions are very good at what they do, which is to disinfect and store your lenses. Their function is to kill microbes on your lenses. They are therefore toxic to living cells  #8211; including your own. The vast majority are preserved with chemicals that are also toxic to eyes  #8211; sometimes causing prolonged inflammation. The temptation may be strong to add a little moisture by squeezing in a drop of storage solution directly into your eye while wearing your lens #8230; BUT avoid this strategy if you want to continue to be able to wear your lenses long term. If your eyes feel dry or uncomfortable, then you should look at #160;treating the dryness rather than using your solution to refresh the lenses. Getting an artifical tear eye drop is the safest and easiest way to avoid dryness. It will actually help solve the problem rather than just the symptoms. They now have eye drops specifically for if you are wearing contact lenses which you can use if you need extra moisture while they are on.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Gas permeable contact lenses are certainly harder on eyes than the regular soft lenses. There are a few reasons you may have to wear gas permeable but I know soft contacts have come a long way in regards to rx range so maybe it's worth asking your doctor if they have anything available for you yet in a soft contact ( if rx range was the issue) Besides that I would certainly follow all the recommendations I said previously: using an artifical tear regularly. Best before you put them on and after you take them off. Using a warm compress maybe once or twice a week can ensure your glands are working at their best. Taking fish oil supplements are a way to naturally increase moisture in your eye so that is an easy add on that could help with some dry eye symptoms. Most importantly for you since you have these types of contacts and have symptoms of dry eye I would make sure you wear eye protection outside. Work googles will be really helpful to keep irritants like dust, debris, and irritation from the wind out of your eyes. A lot of ppl who work outdoors or in dirty dusty environments find they have chronic dry/red eyes and it's because there are allow of things that can get into the eyes with those environments.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>The THC inside of cannabis decreases your blood pressure. This ultimately leads to the expansion of our blood vessels to allow more blood to flow around our body. In the case of eyes, it means that our ocular capillaries are dilated so that they can take in more blood. These expanded blood vessels make the white of the eye appear red, hence the effect. Visine is actually used exactly to solve this problem by constricting those blood vessels back down but if you are a regular marijuana user and use visine regularly its not great for eye health. If im being honest your best bet is not to smoke weed when you need to be around ppl without red eyes lol. The redness in your eyes from smoking isnt causing any issues but it's obviously athestically not a great look. If you can avoid smoking during these times thats ideal or use Visene sparingly. If not you can try a cold compress. Cold can help shrink those blood vessels as well.</TEXT>

In short its better than Visine but still only address red eye and not the cause of red eye so though its safer to use more frequently than Visine ultimately you should try to treat the cause of the red eye rather than the symptom of eye redness for long term success.

    <TEXT>No. Visine will just constrict blood vessels which isnt the issue with allergies. For allergy season you are better off with an eye drop made specifically for allergies that works with an antihistamine to actually address the allergen. Your optometrist can also prescribe prescription eyedrops for allergies if needed. For tear duct damage again Visine doesnt do anything for that issue. If you have damage to your tear duct you may have issues creating natural tears which is where an artificial tear eye drop would be most beneficial. A brand like systane, refresh, etc are going to be your best bet. Just make sure it says artificial tears on the package.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>With wind eyes are definitely prone to water but the reason is probably because winter can cause dry eyes. We are running the heat inside and the air is usually quite dry. As well as cold can be drying so its common to have more symptoms of dry eye in winter. I would try to treat it like you have dry eyes and see if that helps ( artificial tears, warm compress). It would also be very beneficial to wear some form of goggle as wind carries a lot of dirt and debris and that can definitely irritate the eyes</TEXT>

Visine is actually exactly for this, to shrink those blood vessels again but if youre using it regularly its not good. Your best bet is to not smoke when you need clear eyes lol or you can try a cold compress as cold can shrink the blood vessels as well, in theory, but I personal don't know anyone who has tried it.

    <TEXT>Most common reason would be dry eye. Artificial tears can help aid with those symptoms. A warm compress a few times a week can be a big help if the cause of dry eye is gland blockage which is common. Taking an omega3 fish oil supplements can help eyes naturally build more moisture. Also making sure you clean off makeup well if you wear it. There are lash/lid cleaning products that can also ensure glands arent getting blocked by makeup or oils. You could also have allergies in that case I would monitor when your symptoms are worst so you can find a link and maybe be able to stay away from the allergen or take allergy specific eye drops. If none of that works head to the optometrist and they can provide prescription drops to help get that moisture back.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Contact lenses can be a cause of dry eye so its very important to take care of your eyes so you are able to continue to wear contact lenses. If you get chronic dry eyes contact lenses arent going to be comfortable anymore. Most important is to use contact lenses as instructed. If it says only wear for 8 hours and then throw out then do that. If you can wear for 8 hours a day for 2 weeks then do that. Any "abuse" of contact lenses can lead to chronic dry eye issues and maybe other infections/issues. Make sure your case is always clean and you are always using fresh contact lens solution to clean them. If you feel symptoms of dry eye you can use an artificial tear before and after you have them in. They do also make drops specifically for when you have contacts in if you need. Fish oil supplements will help keep your eyes healthy and helps with moisture. There are also certain brands of contacts that are better than others when it comes to dry eye. Acuvue Oasys line of contacts is quite good for dry eyes.</TEXT>

Just to clarify, in case, that contact lens solution is different than an eyedrop specific for contact lenses. Contact lens solution should not be used as eye drops as its purpose is to kill off bacteria which can hurt our eyes. There are artificial tears made for when you are wearing contacts and those should be use to aid with dry eye.

    <TEXT>Visine? Using once or twice a day everyday would not be advisable. That is considered regular use. Your eyes will become dependant on it and it can actually be difficult to stop use. I would get to your optometrist so they can give you a better idea of how to fix the red eyes that are bothering you. If it a cause of marijuana use or something like that then best is to avoid it when you need clear eyes, if you cant try a cold compress, if you absolutely need something than at least switch to lumify. Its still not great to use regularly but its better than Visine.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>The point of this post was to make ppl aware that Visine is not a regular eye drop. It has one purpose and that is to reduce red eye on a seldom bases. Visine doesn't clearly state the difference between a red eye reducer and an artificial tear in ads which is why there is a misconception that Visine is probably good for dry eyes. Many ppl think all eye drops are interchangeable so I was educating that is not the case. Of course Visene is trying to sell Visine lol but I wanted to let ppl know that if they didn't know the difference its not their fault since they don't exactly do a good job of explaining how their product works. If they could just make it more obvious whether on their box or in their ads that it does not treat dry eyes then ppl wouldn't be misusing it as much.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I would say you are better off with an Allergy specific Antihistamine eye drop. These can actually address this issue of the irritation rather than the decongestant which really just focuses on the "look" of to your eye. You may find better relief from an antihistamine drop than youre getting with the decongestant. Your optometrist also has prescription drops for allergies if it's very bothersome. You can use Visine seldomly without issue but in this case I would personally try something the addresses the allergy. A warm compress is an easy way to help soothe eyes as well and you can use regular artificial tears for relief as well.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Well considering I had to tell patients almost daily why Visine is not a lubricating eye drop it is a YSK. Considering over 13 thousand redditors and hundreds of commenters found this helpful makes it pretty clear it is a VERY good YSK. Not every YSK is going to be something you personally dont know. It is a very common misconception. People are under the impression that all eye drops lubricate eyes since they are all liquids. It seems logical if you are unaware of how different ingredients do different things. You can absolutely read the box more carefully to make sure that's the case but when ppl make assumptions of a product they typically just use it as they think it should be used. It's a common error there for a great "nominee" for YSK.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I dont have personal experience with Vizol S but after a quick look it seems like a pretty typical artificial tear which is good. When you are working on a computer you actually blink less which causes strain and dryness. With computer use there is a 20-20-20 rule. Every 20 minutes look up from your screen, look at something 20 ft away for 20 seconds. This is kind of like an eye reset that can help prevent fatigue. Making sure your computer screen is at a proper distance is important as well. The blue light filter glasses will be helpful. You can also change your screen settings to reduce blue light. Its on most computers now in display settings or you can download free programs that will add a tint to your screen to help. I stare at a screen as well and my favourite thing to do for eye care is a warm compress. Before or after work it helps open up the glands of your lid which aids with lubrication. I use a bean bag type eye mask off of amazon that you just microwave. After 5-10 mins its instant relief. For long term eye health fish oil supplements can help dry eye naturally.</TEXT>

Some small studies have shown slight changes in eyes of regular users but it's not concrete and it's not very alarming changes, so far. THC causes the blood vessels in the eyes to expand. Thats what gives the red look. It could be harmless but with high levels of use I can see how that may cause some changes in the eye.
