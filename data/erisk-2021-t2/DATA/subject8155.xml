    <TEXT>I used to have a big gray and white cat called Midas. He was a huge fluffer and a big cuddle bug. At the time, I lived alone with my mum and two cats. We had a living room that was connected to a hall that went straight to the bathroom. Said hallway was between two couches in the living room. I was sitting on one, and my ma was sitting on the other one. We heard the sound of someone peeing in the toilet Me and her were home alone at the time We made direct eye contact before my mom jumped up and looked down the hall, me following shortly after. We saw Midas crouched over the toilet and peeing I caught him one other time, and from time to time I found some piss in the toilet. We had him since he was a kitten, He was not trained at all</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Been contemplating for over a year now. Been getting a bit worse, but I suppose I've had my moments. I would have missed my little miracle kitten that has saved me from many panic attacks, he just knows when I'm upset. Nothing like a purring kitten forcing itself into you lap and shoving their face into your mouth. That's how he hugs. Would have missed the My Chemical Romance reunion tour announcement. They saved my life all those years ago, and it's cool to see them make a return. Wouldn't have ended up reading the Harry Potter books before I died. Wouldn't have seen all the movies either. Wouldn't have picked up the guitar again after a few years of not playing. I wouldn't have written any songs myself. I never would have met a good friend that I have through the internet. Hell, thinking about it, there's a lot of small things that have made my past year pretty okay, despite being depressed and homeless. Makes me rethink a bit, I s'pose.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Alright I've bottled up my feelings quite a lot this past year, and really need some help I'm under the age of eighteen, and still have to live with my ma I'm the youngest, as all my other siblings have moved out, and live their own lives. My dad was abusive (mentally and physically), so me and my mom live alone with each other We are currently homeless and spending a week at my brothers place. (Been homeless since the very beginning of 2017, think that may be what made my misophonia worse? Is that a thing?) Anyways, my brothers roommate also has his homeless mom and his sister staying here for a bit as well. The problem is I can't stand the roommates mom She is physically the most triggering person I have ever had to deal with She has a dry mouth and makes weird clicking/sucking noises and moans a lot because of pain related issues It doesn't help that I hate her as a person too. She's a thief and a liar, and I've noticed strong emotional connections to people make them more triggering, My mom moans and wheezes too, but that I can face with music It's just hard to have a relationship with my mom, even though she's my favorite person. I'm also worried about people eating. There's gonna be 7 people here who don't like to sit down and have family dinner, they all eat at random, and I'm scared. I don't have to many triggers, but the ones I have are terrible. Panic attacks, horrible rage.. I've hurt people with words I've said when I was in a rage and I hate it. I've hurt myself over misophonia. Over the panic I felt, wanting to feel something other than panic or sadness. I've been better with cutting, being a couple weeks clean, but I'm scared with all these people that I might hurt myself. Sometimes I don't really remember doing it, I'm just in such a bad panic attack I scratch until I bleed to try to bring myself out of it, but I don't know that I'm doing it. This isn't even all of it, I just need to get this much off of my chest, because no one else knows. My mom is the only one that doesn't seem to eat in front of me, even though every one else knows I have misophonia. Anyways, sorry, this probably has a ton of mistakes in it, I'm just in a bit of a rush in the moment and don't have time to read through it. Thanks</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Actully, I had this done once! I had dropped like a 35-40 pound container of litter on my toe. I thought it was just bruised because of the odd coloring, but after I literally couldn't walk because of the pain I went into the ER to see what the fuck was happening. (It was like 3hrs before I went in, but it kept getting worse over time). They had my foot X-rayed to make sure I didn't break anything, and they told me there was a shit ton of blood trapped under my toenail. They drilled a hole right through the center and wrapped it, so that it wasn't exposed. I felt immediate pressure relief. The only pain I felt was from it already hurting. It felt fucking great. I still couldn't walk without being in serious pain, but it still felt better. It took like 4 days to drain out completely. My nail eventually grew out and there's no sign that it ever happened.</TEXT>
