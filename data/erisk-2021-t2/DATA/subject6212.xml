I don't see the spinning CD symbol, and there is no activity. When I click it again, it says NR2003 is already running. If I close it out in Task Manager, it then starts up normally. I've also tried running as Administrator with no change. Just started doing this about a month ago, and never before that. Any ideas?</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I just installed the game on Windows 10. I'm having what I believe are anti-aliasing issues on track graphics. Lots of moving/wavy lines. Cars look good. I'm using the same settings I used in the Nvidia Control Panel as I did on my Win 7 machine. Any ideas on what settings need to be changed? I have GTX 980 card. Also with my Wingman Formula Force GP wheel, the Force Feed settings are greyed out in the NR2003 settings, but the force feed is working in the game. Is this normal?</TEXT>

This 28" monitor has a resolution of 2560x1440, and I think it just amplifies the problems. I've tried all kinds of variation with Anisotropic and Anti-aliasing settings in the Nvidia Control Panel.

    <TEXT>I pre-ordered FS2020 from the MS Store, paid for it, and it says it's installed. I see it listed in the MS Store Downloads section, and if I click on it it says not available to play yet. So it appears it's on my PC, but I'm not sure where it installed? Do I have to go to the MS Store every time I want to play? I'm used to downloading files and placing them where I want on my PC. I haven't ordered from the MS Store before, so I'm not sure how it all works. Can someone explain the procedure to me?</TEXT>

    <DATE>2020-08-18 14:18:13</DATE>
    <TEXT>Up and running - going thru Options. FSX seems to have a lot more choices. My initial questions: 1. How do you stop/start the engine with the joystick buttons? 2. How do you set the camera button to go from one view to another, as in FSX? 3. How do you set Slew mode with a keyboard shortcut, as Y in FSX? Also up and down in Slew? 4. How do you change instrument panel views, as using W key in FSX? 5. Still trying to monitor FPS in Developer mode. Not sure how.</TEXT>

If you hold the Freelock key down, you can then rotate the outside view left or right with the other 2 keys. The view will then hold until you change it again. Works great for me!</TEXT>
