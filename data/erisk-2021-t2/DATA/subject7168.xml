    <TEXT>Hey man its good you realize this even after the fact. What u can do is try better next time to control yourself so you dont have to feel this way anymore. I used to have horrible mean outbursts that would really hurt others and then it would affect me. I started to separate myself during these moments so i wouldnt do or say anything id regret. It can be hard and they might just think youre running away or whatever but it might really help. Having time to articulate your feelings into words can do wonders</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Hi been using for a year or so and its been from the same 2 dudes and its been good stuff and i trusted it because my friends swear by them. Tonight my weed plug gave me a sample of some stuff his buddy gets and im a little scared to try because you never know what it can be laced with. Its no more than a couple of lines so i cant really tell by smell like i can with 8balls. Should i do it? I doubt he'd try to kill me but maybe he doesnt know shit itd be nice because my plugs are out or asking $400 for a ball weak</TEXT>
