    <TEXT>The duration depends on the person, it's possible to see results after a few days but it could also take months. My brother for example used the HGH Sub by sapien medicine and grew 1,5 cm in 2 days, so the Subliminals seem legit. Drinking water is always a good idea and your cells need it to reproduce. I think most people will notice subtle changes in their appearance after a few days or weeks. You could also use a booster and blockade remover to get results faster</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I used one subliminal for dark brown hair over 5 months without seeing any results. I've thought that it could work since I thought melanin could be produced by the body itself but now I'm not sure if I should try again?</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Yes, like there's an eating time where you can eat anything you want and then there's time when you're fasting (eg 14 hours fasting, 10 hours eating) and as long as you don't eat a giant amount of calories in this time you will lose weight. I really like it because in other strict diets you'll mostly gain all the weight back when you end it.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>So for me personally I just found out that I would date girls too and that made me realize I'm bisexual. I also found certain female celebrities hot. In an environment like this it's totally fine to say gay or lesbian as long as there is no homophobia intended. For more formal environments I would recommend homosexual (like idk somewhere at work/business meetings). If you feel attraction to both genders you're probably bisexual (you could also have a preference to one gender and still be bi). If you don't care about genders at all you could be pansexual. As long as you're not sure about your sexuality you could refer to yourself as queer (another term for lgbtq+)</TEXT>

    <TITLE>TIFU by almost making out with my friend's sister's boyfriend</TITLE>
    <DATE>2020-08-09 11:45:30</DATE>
    <TEXT>So last night we were partying with a few friends and I got like drunk-drunk. My friend had invited her sister's boyfriend to party with us since they're really close. He was so not-my-type and also 10 (!) years older than me. We were both at the beginning kind of drunk and a low tension build up between us, like he touching my waist and me smirking at him but it kept like sfw. But then we had a second round of shots and we were all lying on the mattresses on the ground in the darkness. He was sitting in an armchair and my friends slowly fell asleep whilst I got up and sat in front of him. Idk how exactly we got there (I was so drunk) but he started to caress my back and I remembered that I even moaned silently. I couldn't see well but I remember noticing that he was right in front of my face. I laid down on the ground eventually and he got up and I just fell asleep. I was so anxious in the morning when I was sober again that my friends noticed anything and I felt so bad since he had a gf. I pretended to forget everything when we were chatting all together in the morning and I found out that he even came back at some point but we were all asleep already. I don't know if he interpreted it like me but I feel so bad rn. Tl,dr: Drunk with friends and got extremely close to making out with a 10-years older guy in a relationship, who wasn't even my type</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I agree. I'm not knowing him at all but he stopped and went away so he might not cheat. Also everybody is different when it comes to alcohol consuming. So maybe I just forgot that he has a gf, idk at all. Another problem is, I really really love my friends and if I tell her sister they'll definitely hate me (what I can comprehend btw). I think, if he still remembers, he seems to be the type who would tell his gf.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Hi, not sure if this is the right sub tho but last night I experienced sleep talking. I realized that I was talking but I was only "half" awake. I think I whispered the name of my friend and asked if she was there if I remember correctly. I feel like something important had come to my mind that I had to tell her. Anyways, I think my eyes were open at this point (I went to toilet before) because I remembered seeing the ceiling. Was this really happening or was it just a weird dream? I swear that it felt real af and I could hear me whispering. Also do you think this has a deeper connection towards my friend? I spent the day with her before, so maybe that was why she was in my mind</TEXT>

But if I see idols like Hwasa or Tzuyu, I just love their bodies and they look so pretty. Especially I preferred when Wendy was at her thiccest point than when she was so thin that you could see her bones. [View Poll](https://www.reddit.com/poll/ipx0zr)</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Well, I know that people can be naturally skinny, but I think that a normal-weight body would really create a better image in kpop. You can look up the weight of idols, and I know that many of those pages have a wrong number but on "real men" they exposed Lisa's weight. I think it was about 46 kg or something, which is, for her height, underweight. I had an ed which was also caused by the body representation in kpop. I met some other anorexics, who said they were also influenced by the mainly underweight idols. I'm definitely not saying kpop idols should put on weight, I'm just wishing to end that enormous diet culture in kpop, if the idol is at a healthy weight.</TEXT>

    <TITLE>My driving lesson teacher is somehow weird</TITLE>
    <DATE>2020-09-15 17:43:29</DATE>
    <TEXT>I have been talking driving lessons (theoretical) for a while now. Yesterday I was completely alone with him (normally we are a class of around 5 people, but you can come whenever you want). Nothing wrong with that but then he started doing some subconscious inappropriate jokes about someone slapping my butt and me sleeping with my boyfriend (thanks for assuming my sexuality asshole). But it gets weirder. During some theoretical teaching he persuaded me to stand up and he took my hands and held them. (Just for clarification, he's around 60 and I'm 17) Is this weird and should I consider only going with friends or is it normal?</TEXT>

    <TITLE>AITA for not responding after an awful date?</TITLE>
    <DATE>2020-10-11 19:06:33</DATE>
    <TEXT>It happened 2 days ago. I finally agreed to go out with this one guy who had a crush on me. We had been chatting for some time ago. I came over around 7 pm. The first issue was a language barrier. His mother tongue was russian and he seemed to not understand every word. Another problem was that we are both akward and weird. At first he decided to play Minecraft multiplayer. Nothing bad, but we switched every time one of us died and watched the other one in silence. He also seemed to hate light bc it was dark the whole time and I barely saw anything. We decided to take the bus to the city. It was raining extremely and the bus didn't came so we walked 40 minutes to the city... mostly in silence. Finally there I decided to go to a bar to loosen up, they didn't had enough space (corona wise) so he decided to go to a cinema. Both were already closed. We thought about getting ice cream - closed. We found a snack bar but he didn't want anything so I just ate something alone. We barely talked and it was just weird. The worst part - I missed my bus and the next one comes in 2 hours. It was 9 pm at this moment. I really really didn't want to spent any more time on this date so I lied about the bus schedule and walked home... The whole 10 km at night alone. I arrived at home after 2 hours and the bus from before passed me lol Tl;Dr: had a date with a guy who had a crush on me, it was akward, boring and tiring. Walked 10 km home just to get away from it AITA for not wanting to answer him now?</TEXT>
