    <TITLE>Hi I #8217;m a clueless American who just moved to Landstuhl area, wanting to make friends</TITLE>
    <DATE>2018-09-23 23:46:24</DATE>
    <TEXT>I #8217;m Bekah, 18. I #8217;m doing online college while I stay with my parents, (I am in a serious relationship) I #8217;m a bit shy but I #8217;d love to make some friends. I love books, currently reading Lord of The Rings. I #8217;m into all kinds of music, mainly indie, though. I like anime, memes, a little bit of gaming (favorite game is Life is Strange), also a big Harry Potter dork haha. I #8217;m a bit of a stoner so if you #8217;re down that #8217;d be awesome. Mainly looking for female friends, it #8217;s just more my comfort zone if you understand. Let me know about yourself too! (Also unfortunately my german is pretty minimal, but I #8217;d love to learn more!)</TEXT>

    <TEXT>This episode I feel was a bit funnier than lasts, I think they are going on the right track but I'd really like to see more of the group together again, and the boys just acting like boys in the midst of a wacky world. Also, this is gonna sound controversial.. but less of Randy PLEASE, he's been way overplayed- he's funny but now every time he comes on screen I just get bored. I wanna see episodes like Imaginationland or The Ring again...</TEXT>

    <TEXT>How about more timeless creative episodes? Imaginationland, Casa bonita, Cancelled, Towelie, Hell even the Black Friday trilogy... wanna see more episodes about the boys in their wacky town. No more Randy for a good while PLEASE, dear god he's swallowed up the whole show- everyone just reacts to him and we don't get to see any of the main characters hardly ever anymore. I don't know, they've definitely lost their edge... this new season might have potential, given they've ended the season plots.. but so far it seems still quite bland. Hoping they'll change but I think South Park has passed it's pentacle</TEXT>

    <TITLE>American dependent looking for crisis English help in Germany (RP)</TITLE>
    <DATE>2020-05-23 19:00:38</DATE>
    <TEXT>Hi. I don #8217;t want to share too much personal info, but I #8217;m a 20 yr old American army dependent living with my mom here. I #8217;m currently going through some significant mental health issues and severe depression. I was sexually assaulted a year ago by my ex, and I #8217;ve lost lots of friends and have no support here. Home life is not good and I #8217;m at my wits end. Idk what to do or who to call, I think I #8217;m in need of a psychiatric stay but I #8217;m scared and I only speak English and I don #8217;t know how well the German psychiatric hospitals are or how scary it will be. I tried seeing a therapist but she #8217;s not helping much and seems very cold to my problems. If anyone has any information for me that would be greatly appreciated. I #8217;m feeling very suicidal at the moment, but I don #8217;t want to feel this way.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Omg I was the exact same way about 6 and 7 for YEARS. For real, ever since I was a kid (I was diagnosed very young because I had a list of very bad compulsions and my anxiety was vert high. In short I was NOT high functioning with it) I couldn #8217;t even write it for math, or even type it in 6 in a calculator at school, if I did I #8217;d have to type or write 7 seven times to balance it out. It literally sent me into panic attacks before. I could also never pause anything on the sixth minute or second, would have to wait, and couldn #8217;t unlock my phone on the 6th minute either. It took me a very long time to work through it, and that wasn #8217;t even my biggest ocd problem, but the fact that I can even type it in this comment speaks volumes for how much years of therapy has done for me. Lol sometimes I still get uncomfortable with the number though, still can #8217;t pause anything on the 6th second.</TEXT>

    <TITLE>Romance book to help me connect with my desire for intimacy/romance with another?</TITLE>
    <DATE>2020-09-28 19:32:06</DATE>
    <TEXT>Assault and abuse survivor here. I #8217;ve really been wanting to reconnect with my romantic, vulnerable side but I can #8217;t seem to access it much anymore. I #8217;ve gone through a string of pretty traumatic relationships and am finally single, and I #8217;m trying to heal some pretty intimacy issues through the use of classic escapism and reading. I #8217;ve always been someone who dives into fictional worlds and lives pretty easily, it #8217;s my life line so I figured this may be a way to open myself back up to the general desire to love and connect and be intimate. I #8217;m a bisexual woman so I don #8217;t mind if the book is lgbt romance or straight romance, just anything that has an overall wholesome, non toxic/abusive vibe to it. I also love poetry as well so if anyone has any suggestions I #8217;d seriously appreciate it !</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I deal with a very high functioning BPD due to years of therapy and I've also been close friends and dated people with BPD and this is crazy similar to what its like. God, it was almost triggering for me because it just brought me back to the intense, antagonizing fights Ive had that have left me in tears. I honesty have a feeling this has been slowly built up each podcast. You can tell she was kinda bubbling under the surface several times since they started this. I think he just upsets her because hes able to tell her things she doesn't want to accept about herself. I feel for her, she feels trapped by her own mental illness.
