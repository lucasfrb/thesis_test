    <TITLE>Reading Kin no Kanojo Gin no Kanojo</TITLE>
    <DATE>2017-11-21 15:29:21</DATE>
    <TEXT>Already on chapter 28, too bad there are only 30 so far ;_; I really love the plot and the humor in this one! Could be a bit more ecchi maybe hehe I've read some criticism about it not being original on some website. But if you ask me, that's nonsense. While it's true that the beginning of the story isn't innovative, the manga itself has it's own character with some nice cliches and classical additions imo! I'm enjoying it a lot so far and can recommend it!</TEXT>

    <TITLE>BotW 1.4 no Text on Map</TITLE>
    <DATE>2017-12-25 09:41:41</DATE>
    <TEXT>I'm playing version 1.4 on Cemu 1.11.2 and I've noticed that my map only shows the shiekah hyroglyphes but not the latin letters. Exactly like in this post here: https://www.reddit.com/r/Breath_of_the_Wild/comments/7lutp9/confused_on_world_map/ However I think it's an issue related to the Emulator not the game. Restarting couldn't fix it and trying different settings either yet. Do anyone know how to fix this?</TEXT>

    <DATE>2017-12-28 18:03:24</DATE>
    <TEXT>Hey, I'd like to ask/suggest for a feature! It would be awesome to edit the effects of armors, like for example enabling stealth on the Nintendo shirt or whatever you like I like the new outfits which came with the dlc's unfortunately some of them aren't upgradeable by the fairies and some doesn't even have any effects at all. So, is this even possible?</TEXT>

    <TEXT>If you're playing on Cemu, you just have to turn off the clear rune graphics pack. That did the trick for me. Otherwise you probably have to contact the Nintendo customer support.</TEXT>

    <TITLE>Design after Computer Science BSc?</TITLE>
    <DATE>2019-11-28 20:29:20</DATE>
    <TEXT>So I'm currently at the finish line of my Bachelor's degree in computer science and looking for a university in Europe, preferably Germany, to make my Master degree. I'm now experienced with DevOps, automation, embedded systems and a few other CS stuff. However I realized that I might should rather try something that appeals more to me than CS. Which is Design. I've spent a year working as a UX/UI designer and spent lots of free time with Photoshop on digital graphics. What I now would like to do is finding a Master's degree where I can combine my CS skills and background with my appeal and talent for design. Is there a suiting combination for such a Master?</TEXT>

    <TITLE>Apple Pen Angle Adjustment</TITLE>
    <DATE>2020-08-02 11:31:04</DATE>
    <TEXT>Hi,I've been using the iPad Pro with the Pen for a while now and lately I'm trying to replicate the sketching on paper style that I enjoy a lot with paper and pen. With a bit of tweaking, using layers, transparancy and practice it works out quite well. However, I'm stumbling across the issue that the pen just decides to go into that "sanding" mode whenever I hit the wrong angle. Please see the image below to get the idea. [![IMG](https://i.imgur.com/Kwx6dET.jpg)] [https://imgur.com/a/3m9kjQH](https://imgur.com/a/3m9kjQH)  #8203;  #8203; I have no idea what exactly to adjust to ged rid of it, so if anyone knows what to do, please share your proposals!Thanks!</TEXT>

    <TEXT>yeah I tried that! Tried the 0 #176;, tried the 90 #176;. It's honestly didn't change much, I still get that "sanding". It rather changes the outcome of the sanding/gradient (if you can call it like that). I mean it's a cool effect for sure, but it just happens accidentally for me which is pretty annoying.</TEXT>
