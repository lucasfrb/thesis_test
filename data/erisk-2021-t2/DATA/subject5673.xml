    <TITLE>[Question] Anyone had success reducing redness?</TITLE>
    <DATE>2020-05-14 19:29:20</DATE>
    <TEXT>I have had redness around my nose for as long as I can remember (I'm 24, so at least 10 years). [https://imgur.com/a/Dz86aiA](https://imgur.com/a/Dz86aiA) As you can see, I have very fair skin with freckles so the redness really stands out and I'm extremely self-conscious of it. I can cover it with makeup, but I would like so much to feel *comfortable in my own skin*. I have an oily T-zone, but the skin on my cheeks and around my mouth is very dry. I have very sensitive skin and I don't really know a lot about skincare. Since about a year ago, I usually wash my face twice a day with the Aloe Calming Foaming Wash from The Body Shop, and follow with their aloe vera day/night cream. I don't think the redness is an irritation to the products because I have had it for so long and have various different skincare routines over the time that it has been there. I've tried acne treatments on it but I'm starting to think it's a sensitivity problem, rather than acne. Does anyone recognise this type of redness and know how to get rid of it or at least reduce it?</TEXT>

I think that's probably what it is but I'm not sure. It just seems strange that it has always looked like that and never changed.</TEXT>

    <DATE>2020-05-26 16:04:33</DATE>
    <TEXT>I've struggled on and off with depression and anxiety for 11 years (since I was 13). And I've tried CBT, counselling and sertraline/Zoloft. Nothing has helped. I exercise regularly, eat healthily, have a regular sleep pattern and don't excessively drink alcohol/caffeine or take drugs. I have huge sudden mood swings. I'm always irritable. Sometimes I get so angry that all I can do to calm down is punch myself, so I always have bruises on my thigh. I have no motivation to do things and don't enjoy anything a lot of the time. I don't want to live like this but I don't see how anything could work. Is it normal to go through lots of different medicines before you find the right one?? Is it even worth it</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I came off the pill a month ago, so I can tell you what's happened for me but obviously it's a short term experience. I went on birth control for the same reason - heavy, painful and irregular periods and have also been on it for 6 years. I decided to stop taking it a month ago because I believe it might have caused my IBS and because I have problems with depression and anxiety so I wanted to try not taking synthetic hormones. Immediately after stopping the pill, I had a headache every day for about two weeks (only mild so bearable). But other than that I haven't felt any different at all until last week. My period would have come yesterday if I hadn't stopped the pill but for the past 4 days I've had some really bad PMS, particularly getting extremely depressed and angry and having an IBS flare up, which are problems I have anyway but not THIS bad. This probably isn't very helpful because it's specific to me and only short term. But I'm not sure whether these symptoms are what life is like off the pill for me, or if it's just because of a change and not having settled yet (reeeaally hoping for the former...) Also I would recommend using the app Clue. You can track different symptoms that you have to check if there is a pattern and they are related to your period and when to predict them.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Hi, I have the same problem and I started using TO niacinamide and zinc, but it didn't seem to have any effect. Then I was told that niacinamide isn't good for very sensitive skin (which I have), and that modulating glucosides and borage seed oil are good. I have ordered both of those, as well as azelaic acid, so will try them all separately. You could look into those and I will let you know if I have any success!</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I started getting more into skincare a few weeks ago and bought MeMe's vitamin C serum from Amazon and I don't recognise the brand and I'm now unsure if the sellers or reviews are legit.

    <TITLE>Do I have to cure anxiety and depression before having pain-free sex?</TITLE>
    <DATE>2020-06-02 08:50:50</DATE>
    <TEXT>Sex has always been extremely painful for me and I couldn't get tampons in for a long time. Whenever I've seen doctors they've always told me to 'just relax' but I've been with my boyfriend for 4 years and he's so caring and there is no pressure, but when we try it's still just so painful and we either can't do it at all or have to stop after a few seconds. I spoke to a GP about it again today and he told me that while I don't have my anxiety and depression under control, this will always be a big problem for me. But I've always had anxiety and depression and I've tried CBT, counselling and sertraline/Zoloft. I honestly don't think I will ever not struggle with this, and it's unbearable to think that this will mean painful sex for the rest of my life. Has anyone gotten over this pain but still struggles with their mental health?</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I have a persistent redness around the edge of my nose and it's been that way for years and years. I also have very fair skin so the redness really stands out and I hate it. I assume it's irritated skin since my skin is sensitive - so recently started treating it that way. Haven't had an improvement yet but these are the products I started using.. I was recommended NIOD Modulating Glucosides and TO cold-pressed borage seed oil. I've been using them for a couple of weeks so I can't really say if it's helping or not yet (I think it can take a while). I very briefly tried TO niacinamide and zinc but it made the redness slightly worse if anything and then I found out that while it's supposed to help with redness, it's not good for sensitive skin so I stopped using it.</TEXT>

Or if someone makes an assumption about me that's just random, I'll obsess over what about me made them think that.

    <TEXT>You sound similar to me. I've seen several GPs and a couple of counsellors in the past decade (nothing stuck) and I think BPD was mentioned once, but usually it's just depression and social anxiety but BPD just seems to fit. And I think it's just easy for them to label everything with depression/anxiety, it's such a catch-all thing to say and a lot of them just don't care. Based on my experience anyway.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I feel like I'm in a similar position to you right now, and I'm really sorry that you also feel this way. For me as well, I'll think I feel ok and I try to capitalise on that and be productive and then stuff goes wrong and I feel sad and angry with such intensity that I just have to do something (that I'll regret). I don't have an answer to this because I'm also struggling to cope but sometimes I'll write in this little book that I have. I always think that when people tell you to write your thoughts or feelings down it seems so stupid and annoying, but I sort of write some horrible stuff - I detail the self-harm that I would like to do, rather than actually doing it, and most of the time it does make me calm down. I still feel shit afterwards but the intensity and the rage has died down. I guess it's something to do with slowing your thoughts down enough to write them on paper. I hope you find something that works.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Not at all. They have always been very involved in my life though and judgemental about certain things but generally, no. I think a lot of why I am the way I am comes from bullying in secondary school. You?</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I'm not sure if this is the same thing but when my boyfriend is upset, he prefers to keep it to himself and I can't help but assume that it's something I've done/said and I'll obsess over that, even though I know it's probably nothing to do with me.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I know you've probably heard this a lot, but most women worry more about being judged than doing any judging. My boyfriend's mum is the most judgemental person I've ever met but I lived with her for a few months and got to know her more, and as bad as it is for my mental health to be around her, I can really tell that the judgement comes from her being very insecure and having been judged herself. Almost like she's not truly judging people, but it's just a defense mechanism, and often jealousy - whether she knows it or not. If you can try to recognise that in other people then I hope that helps.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Tbh not well hahah I had CBT years ago and hated it. But since then I've moved around a lot - uni, studying abroad, moving back home, and about to move out - so I haven't had constant access to a medical service and that's why I've seen so many GPs about it. I had counselling on the NHS a few months ago and it was so shit, the guy was a trainee and he wasn't good at it. I tried Sertraline for a few months and it did nothing so I don't really know what to do now. Basically I'm not in a good position to advise you, but imo if you're not happy with your therapist, surely it's worth trying another?</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I know what you mean about the meds. I was reluctant to try any and I'm reluctant even now to try any more. They fuck with you when you try to wean off them too. I have seen some stuff about DBT on this subreddit and I was thinking about just getting a DBT workbook, that might be something you could try? I haven't looked into which yet, but I'd have to be picky because whenever I get told to meditate/practice mindfulness/breathing techniques etc, it just really pisses me off. Worth a shot I guess!</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I have always been diagnosed with depression and anxiety and I recently realised that I relate SO hard to quiet BPD. How did you eventually get diagnosed with it? Also, how does the treatment differ? I've seen so many GPs, tried CBT a while ago and more recently tried counselling while also on sertraline and nothing has worked. I feel quite hopeless about treating it now.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I always get this paranoid feeling that all of my friends and my boyfriend hang out without me and have group chats without me and that they don't really like me. It's almost always a small niggling feeling and occasionally it blows up and makes me panic a bit until I realise that it's ridiculous...probably.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>In the same vein, I think colouring in or doing puzzles can help. I'm interested to try essential oils for helping to relax.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I used to do this so much, especially when trying to sleep as I've always had trouble sleeping. Also a lot on really warm sunny days. Sometimes I'll just be daydreaming and someone will come and speak to me and I secretly just want them to leave so I can continue with my story. I'd also sometimes think of something I want to daydream about but I'm busy or with people, and I'd sort of store it in my mind for later use, not sure if that makes sense. But recently I've found it really hard to daydream at all. I still try but it's like there's nothing there, like my head is just blank or like that part of my mind has gone and it feels horrible, it feels broken. I don't know if it's because I've grown up or because I don't really read anymore, or do the other creative things that I used to do and it's killed my imagination. Any tips haha?</TEXT>
