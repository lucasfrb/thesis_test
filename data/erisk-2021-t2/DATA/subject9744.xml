    <TEXT>I have found a way for enter into an old permanently desactivated yahoo account (I don't know if it is already another way or it is already known), just choose the "I forget my password option" that sends to your second email the link to recover/change it. Put a new one and it should automatically log into the main yahoo page with your "recycled account" then just choose the top-right message button and you can enter to your yahoo email.</TEXT>

    <TITLE>Problems with new XPS 13 9350 Developer Edition</TITLE>
    <DATE>2016-07-16 11:22:55</DATE>
    <TEXT>My XPS arrived 3 days ago and since then I have had a lot of problems, I am using the Ubuntu 14.04 version that comes with the laptop: Most of the times when I close the lid, it enters in suspension mode, after opening it, I start typing the password but then the screen goes black. I am experiencing a very slow downloading speed when installing apps or updating through the terminal (apt-get update, apt-get install firefox...). Sometimes after starting Ubuntu I get error messages of the type: "System program problem detected" (ProblemType: KernelOops, Package: linux-image 3.19...origin unknown). Anyone with the same problems? Thanks!</TEXT>

    <TITLE>Which Cosmere-ish book series do you know?</TITLE>
    <DATE>2019-04-11 17:34:18</DATE>
    <TEXT>Hi, There are a few good posts already ([this](https://www.reddit.com/r/Cosmere/comments/5jly40/no_spoilers_what_to_read_after_cosmere_novels/), [this](https://www.17thshard.com/forum/topic/58050-what-to-read-after-all-the-cosmere-books/), and [this](https://www.reddit.com/r/brandonsanderson/comments/75nbrp/books_like_cosmere/)) about what to read after Cosmere. But my question goes more towards which books series do you know that have in-world references to other books, and complement each other behind the scenes.  #8203; Thanks!  #8203; EDIT: Now, I remember the Real of the Elderlings (Robin Hobb). More than 5 sagas in the same world. Also, they are similar to the Mistborn ones, as the World changes between eras.</TEXT>

It hurts so much, but I did it. I accept that. You cannot have her. You cannot take her from me again.  gt;From Oathbringer, Chapter 119 - Unity. Dalinar confronts Odium before uniting the Realms. In that last bit, "You cannot take her from me again", is he acknowledging that is Odium's fault that Evi is no longer there? If being literal, Cultivation is the one who takes away Evi from Dalinar by suppressing his memories, not Odium. So what do you think that last part mean?</TEXT>

    <TITLE>About Gloryspren</TITLE>
    <DATE>2019-12-17 20:16:50</DATE>
    <TEXT>In Oathbringer, Chapter 67: Mishim, Shallan notes that a Gloryspren attracted by Elhokar is not corrupted by the presence of Sja-anat:  gt;A simple compliment probably should not have made a king beam like it did. Elhokar even drew a gloryspren #8212;and notably, it didn #8217;t seem different from ordinary ones. However, later on Chapter 77: Stormshelter, there is a mention of a corrupted one, attracted by a random person:  gt; #8220;Nothing. #8221; Shallan shrugged, blowing at her little carving on the table. It was of a corrupted gloryspren in the shape of a cube, which another patron had attracted. I wonder if this is just a coincidence, or maybe the fact that Elhokar was about to swear the First Ideal had something to do. Also, maybe there is a relationship to either Renarin and Glys (a Radiant that has attracted and bonded a corrupted Spren), or even the fact that Gloryspren are to Bondsmiths the same as Windspren to Windrunners? EDIT: A last mention to another corrupted Gloryspren. This time on Shadesmar from Chapter 97: Riino:  gt;She followed his nod and spotted an odd little spren floating through the air. Bone-white and brown, it had wings extending to the sides and long tresses for a tail. In front of its body hovered a cube.  #8220;Looks like those gloryspren we saw earlier, #8221; she noted.  #8220;Only the wrong color. And the shape of the head is #8230; #8221;  #8220;Corrupted! #8221; Syl said.  #8220;That #8217;s one of Odium #8217;s! #8221;</TEXT>

Something that confuses me: The Eila Stele has appeared in Oathbringer, and is supposedly written by a Parshendi. Is Brandon saying that this is not the case above? Or that The Rythm of War is the first non-human book to be the title of a SA book?</TEXT>

    <TITLE>Death Rattle of first TWoK chapter and YAUT</TITLE>
    <DATE>2020-05-04 11:39:03</DATE>
    <TEXT>The Death Rattle of the first chapter of The Way of Kings, "Stormblessed", is:  gt; #8220;You've killed me. Bastards, you've killed me! While the sun is still hot, I die!  #8221;  gt; #8212;Collected on Betabachah 1171, 10 seconds pre-death, by the Silent Gatherers. Subject was a darkeyed soldier thirty-one years of age. Sample is considered questionable. This made me think about Yet Another Unity Theory (YAUT). Can we have this as a tag? ;) Basically what Odium says in Chapter 119 of Oathbringer, "Unity":  gt; #8220;No! #8221; Odium screamed. He stepped forward.  #8220;No, we killed you. WE KILLED YOU! #8221; I see an interesting parallel about the phrasing of these: There is the you/me word on both, and a reference to a group of people 'bastards'/'we' killing somebody. Also, going complete crackpot here, the Sun reminds me to the other Sun/warmth/light that Dalinar senses throughout Oathbringer, suspected to be related with Unity. Only thing here, can Death Rattles be about the past, or only the future? Any thoughts on this?</TEXT>

    <TITLE>Does swearing an oath...</TITLE>
    <DATE>2020-05-23 13:03:01</DATE>
    <TEXT>... have similar effects as opening a perpendicularity? This is a bit tinfoil-hat theory. Something I realised is that when Lift swears the third Oath coincides with Nale realising he was wrong by hunting down Radiants. Seems that he loses part of his madness. This reminds me as how Taln went lucid shortly after Dalinar swore the third Oath and opened Honor's perpendicularity. Although that also happened when Shallan Lightweaved in front of him in WoR, IIRC. Also swearing Oaths gives a short boost of power (Syl points this when Kaladin tries to swear the fourth Oath in Shadesmar). In general, maybe there is a relationship with Oaths and the Realms: they get mixed briefly and give a boost in Stormlight and Spiritual healing (if that's the correct term). Thoughts?</TEXT>

Will Lift train potential Edgedancers? How are doing Adolin and Shallan married? How is Jasnah doing as Queen? Are more humans joining Odium's army (apart from Nale's? Will Venli join the Radiants? Which is Adolin's punishment for killing Sadeas? How do people, specially Kholin brothers, react to Evi's death? * Some theories answered: Sibling and Urithiru, Unity, Adolin and Edgedancers, is Rock a Stoneward? And the list goes on and on. What are the things you want to see? Maybe Wandersail (if it happens) has any of this?</TEXT>

The second one literally has the quote as the chapter name, and happens after the death of Elhokar:  gt;Storms. Grieve later.  gt;Oathbringer - Chapter 85: Grieve Later. I just found it curious how he does not let himself think about the death of both of them. It really fits the view of Adolin as a shiny beacon for other characters while does not let them "see the cracks in his armor". Any thoughts on this?</TEXT>

    <TITLE>A thought about Oathbringer Shardblade</TITLE>
    <DATE>2020-06-09 15:38:22</DATE>
    <TEXT>It appears that Oathbringer was in the early steps of reviving, similar to Maya. When Adolin is about to face the Thunderclast during the Thaylen Battle:  gt;He felt something. **A stirring on the wind.**  #8220;You want to fight it, don #8217;t you? #8221; Adolin asked.  #8220;It reminds you of when you were alive. #8221; **Something tickled his mind, very faint, like a sigh.** A single word: Mayalaran.  gt;Oathbringer - Chapter 120: The Spear That Would Not Break. First time Oathbringer appears on-screen:  gt;This sword was a part of him. **He could sense energy racing along its blade, as if it were eager.** A man never really knew life itself until he charged into battle with Plate and Blade.  gt;The Way of Kings - Chapter 13: Ten Heartbeats. In both occasions, they appear to feel *something* coming from the blade itself. Also, when Dalinar recovers Oathbringer after Sadeas' death:  gt;He seized the sword, bracing himself for the screams. The cries of a dead spren. **They weren #8217;t the shrill, painful shrieks he #8217;d heard when touching other Blades, but more of a whimper.** **The sound of a man backed into a corner, thoroughly beaten and facing something terrible, but too tired to keep screaming.**  gt; #8220;**This one doesn #8217;t scream as loudly as others**. Why? #8221; It remembers your oath, the Stormfather sent. It remembers the day you won it, and better the day you gave it up. **It hates you #8212;but less than it hates others**.  gt;Oathbringer - Chapter 28: Another Option. Counterpoints I can think of, is that Dalinar feels that the blade was eager at the beginning of TWoK. When he recovers it, its more of a beaten feeling. Also, Dalinar was starting to bond the Stormfather before the start of TWoK, but he did not feel the blade scream. However he seems to feel this eager feeling. Thoughts?</TEXT>

    <TITLE>Proposed change of theory regarding Adolin</TITLE>
    <DATE>2020-06-10 10:37:35</DATE>
    <TEXT>Note that I based part of the ideas from [this](https://www.reddit.com/r/Stormlight_Archive/comments/gzt0by/brandon_released_great_descriptions_of_all_10/) post of yesterday. More than 200 comments, quite insightful! Adolin was born under the sign of the nine ([this](https://www.reddit.com/r/Stormlight_Archive/comments/h07lnh/for_your_consideration_coincidence_or_not/) post made me remember this fact). What about, instead of him becoming an Edgedancer, him becoming of the 9th Order of Radiants, Stonewards (note, I am going to get a lot of red herrings, I just find it fun that now makes more sense that Adolin is a Stoneward and not an Edgedancer):  gt;Stoneward oaths focus on team dynamics, on learning to work with others, and on being there for those who need them. They put the interests of others before their own, and will not bend their Ideals for the sake of convenience. Adolin seems to merge well into groups, and work with them. Also, we know how supporting Adolin is, always caring for others meanwhile he does not let himself show the cracks in his armor.  gt;Stonewards are the infantry and ground troops of the Radiants and are renowned as their finest soldiers. (A title that, on occasion, the Windrunners dispute.) Adolin seems to have a lot of military training, and we have seen how good is him on the battlefield. Also, the dispute with Windrunners, is this a foreshadowing of the early confrontation between Kaladin and Adolin?  gt;They tend to attract those who are most interested in warfare, prowess with weapons, or athletics of any sort. They like a challenge, and in times of peace are seen engaging in (and running) various sporting events of both a military and non-military nature. May I introduce you to the art of Dueling? There is this Champion duelist called Adolin. He got the title (IIRC) in a duel versus 4 Shardbearers.  gt;Many enjoy the outdoors, and you #8217;ll find exploration enthusiasts among them, as well as those who just like the fresh air. Hmmm, anyone finds a connection here?  gt;They tend to be known for their can-do attitudes and for taking on enormous projects (sometimes more than they can handle). Adolin vs 4 Shardbearers, Adolin vs Thunderclast are examples that come into my mind.  gt;However, most agree that the primary attribute of the Stonewards is their dependability. Though sometimes gregarious, they are never flighty. If a Stoneward is your friend, they will be there for you, and that is a core tenet of their Order #8212;to be there when they are needed. Adolin seems to be friends with many people, independently of their social status. He has been quite supportive for others when they needed it. Many can rely on him.  gt;Another key attribute is their ability to take a difficult situation with few resources and make something better of it. Though not known as inventors or creators, they are good at improvising solutions to problems in the moment. Not sure of exact example, but given how he develops on the battlefield, he seems to pull a lot of tricks quite easy. It comes to my mind three scenes: When he depletes of Stormlight an opponent on a duel, when he uses his Shardblade as kind of a lever when fighting Parshendi with another Shardbearer, and when he starts to carve through the crem buildings to attack from behind on the Battle of Narak. Maybe also the plan to infiltrate the Kholinar palace? Thoughts?</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Hey all, Just wanted to share which was my first Cosmere reading order. Also, I am curious to know what do you think of it. Just keep in mind that I found out what the Cosmere was pretty early, so that might have biased my reading order. TLDR: Mistborn Era 1, Elantris X anniversary, TWoK, Warbreaker, WoR, AU (White Sand comics instead of prose), Mistborn Era 2, OB. This is the order: * **Mistborn Era 1**: After reading The Reckoners, I was recommended this saga. By the end of the second book I was aware (spoiled myself by reading the Coppermind) that connections between books existed, such as still-unknown magic fundamentals or some recurring characters.  #8203; * **Elantris X anniversary**: In order to take a break from a trilogy of books, I decided to read his first work. This was not really a Cosmere-info-dump book as Mistborn, but it was a nice read (anyone else felt the Sanderlanche was the whole second half of the book?).  #8203; Now, we have left 3 SA books, Warbreaker, AU and 3 Mistborn Era 2 books. This is how I read them: * **The Way of Kings**: Book with a lot of Cosmere exposure, although many questions were unanswered, IIRC it was the second time the Three Realms were mentioned (first is in a brief epigraph of THoA).  #8203; * **Warbreaker**: Two reasons why this is here: To rest from the long book TWoK is, and because of the many recommendations I read about the connections between this one and SA. Was not disappointed.  #8203; * **Words of Radiance**: Second in SA, and continues to deliver a lot of exposure into de Cosmere. Also, raises many more questions.  #8203; Here the order goes a bit of a trainwreck, but hold on! It makes sense, I promise! I knew that Oathbringer would be my last SA book at the moment, and also that AU would give me lots and lots of exposure to the Cosmere, probably making the read of the former book much more interesting. AU also contains some novellas such as Secret History (should read before Mistborn Era 2) and Edgedancer (should read before OB), which fixes the reading order a bit. Finally, I needed a break from long books, so short stories and novellas were welcomed. So, this is the last leg of my Cosmere reading order: * **AU**: Cosmere Spoilers, the Book. Between Khriss essays and Secret History, you can get a very good idea of the Cosmere as a whole (Shards, Realms, Worldhoppers...). Note that I didn't read White Sand prose since it was not canon, instead, I got the Comics.  #8203; * **Mistborn Era 2 (up to TBoM)**: Fun, short books set 300 years after Era 1. Expands the magic system, and the last book deeps a bit into Cosmere in the global sense. Also, Sovereign identity is quite crazy.  #8203; * **Oathbringer**: Last station in the reading order! With all the background I got from the previous books (and obviously lurking in the subreddit and The Coppermind) I think that's one of the reasons why I enjoyed OB so much, and probably the best of the three published SA books so far. Does anyone think that Part 5 is incredible in terms of Cosmere stuff and what our characters go through?? So that's all folks. Thoughts?</TEXT>

    <TEXT>So I read a post on r/Brandonsanderson (https://www.reddit.com/r/brandonsanderson/comments/hizlh6/psa_dark_one_private_qa_livestream/) mentioning that an email with the private livestream details had been sent (it will be tomorrow). Question is, **has anyone who preordered the digital version also got that email?** I did preorder the digital version, but haven't received such email (I did got the email with the extra stuff download links, and for the comic itself). I am a little worried that I am missing the stream. Also, I checked on WayBackMachine and even if you preorder the digital version, it still mentions access to the livestream: https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://store.vaultcomics.com/products/brandon-sandersons-dark-one (select, for example, 18th of June).

    <TITLE>[SA/Mistborn] About a fragment of Oathbringer's preface</TITLE>
    <DATE>2020-07-13 13:27:07</DATE>
    <TEXT>This is mainly about how someone experiences an Ascension and, tangentially, about Unity. I added references to other Ascensions in the P.S. Regarding these quotes from Dalinar's Preface to "Oathbringer":  gt;I can point to the moment when I decided for certain this record had to be written. I hung between realms, seeing into Shadesmar #8212;the realm of the spren #8212;and beyond. The moment referred is when Dalinar has just opened Honor's Perpendicularity. I assume that, per Odium's words, he is Ascending (I guess that not at the same level as Kelsier/Vin/Sazed, see P.S.).  gt; I thought that I was surely dead. Certainly, some who saw further than I did thought I had fallen. I did not die. I experienced something worse. Here is when speculation regarding his Ascension begins: I understand that the other someone is Odium. Now, my questions are regarding Dalinar assuming he was dead, but realizing he was "experiencing something worse". Did he really Ascend (not necessarily to a Shard, maybe a Sliver), but in the process he rejected it? Is it why he is experiencing something worse than dying (take into account that he had just experienced Rathalas and his savage youth all over again). Maybe the pain when he was De-Ascending? After all, he seems to be "Unity" for a brief moment, which makes Odium say 'We killed you" and flee. Which are your thoughts? . . . P.S: Other known Ascensions seem not to be so painful: Sazed when ascends to Harmony:  gt;He drew them in, feeling them infuse his body, making him burn. His flesh and bones evaporated, but as they did, he tapped his copperminds, dumping their entire contents into his expanding consciousness. Here it is mentioned that Sazed body burns and evaporates, but there is no mention to him feeling pain. Maybe because he is completely Connected to both? Vin when she starts to take the mists before Ascending:  gt;Vin gasped, drawing in breath #8212;a breath that sucked in the mists. She felt suddenly warm, the mists surging within her, lending her their strength. Her entire body burned like metal, and the pain disappeared in a flash. The body burns here, too, but it seems a welcoming feeling. For Vin, also, the mists heal here physical pain. Vin after ascending to Preservation:  gt;Why couldn't she feel anything? She tried to reach down, to push herself to her knees, but the ground seemed strangely far away. And, she saw no arms in front of her. She just continued to float.  gt;  gt;*I'm dead,* she thought.  gt;  gt;Even as that occurred to her, she woke up a bit more. She could see, though it was as if she looked through a very blurry, distorting pane of glass. She felt . . . a power buzzing within her. A strength unlike that of limbs #8212;but somehow more versatile. Curiously Vin thinks she is dead after Ascending (might be a red herring). Kelsier when he Ascends:  gt;With a cry of exultation, he felt the power flow through him, like Allomancy a hundred times over. A feverish, molten, burning energy that washed through his soul. He laughed, rising into the air, expanding, becoming everywhere and everything. Burning again and no pain. Maybe because Kelsier is a CS here? Kelsier when he De-Ascends:  gt;Vin drew in the mists.  gt;  gt;And Ruin #8217;s full fury came against Kelsier, slamming him down, ripping into his soul. Tearing him apart.  gt;  gt;Kelsier was cloven asunder with a rending, pervasive pain #8212;like that of a bone being pulled from a socket. He tumbled, unable to see or think #8212;unable to do more than scream at the attack.  gt;  gt;He ended up someplace surrounded by mist, blind to anything beyond its shifting. Death, for real this time? No #160;. #160;. #160;. but he was very close. He could feel the stretching coming upon him again, coaxing him, trying to pull him toward that distant point where everyone else had gone.  gt;  gt;He wanted to go. He hurt *so much*. He wanted it all to end, to go away. Everything. He just wanted it to stop. Is Kelsier's pain due to De-Ascending? Or, probably, due to Ruin's attack? Both? Finally, on Vin and the power in the Well of Ascension. When she touches the Well:  gt;The power came upon her suddenly.  gt;  gt;She felt the liquid pressing against her, creeping into her body, crawling, forcing its way through the pores and openings in her skin. She opened her mouth to scream, and it rushed in that way too, choking her, gagging her.  gt;  gt;With a sudden flare, her earlobe began to hurt. She cried out, pulling her earring free, dropping it into the depths. She pulled off her sash, letting it #8212;and her Allomantic vials #8212;go as well, removing the only metals on her person.  gt;  gt;Then she started to burn. She recognized the sensation: it was exactly like the feeling of burning metals in her stomach, except it came from her entire body. Her skin flared, her muscles flamed, and her very bones seemed on fire. She gasped, and realized the metal was gone from her throat. Same burning feeling, but now there is pain, too (it seems to come before the burning, before dropping her metals). Is it because of the pendant/spike? Her other metals? Vin releases the power at the Well:  gt;Vin cried out as the flaring power within her was ripped away, soaked up greedily by the void. She screamed, her glow fading, then fell into the now empty pool, head knocking against the rocks.  gt;  gt;\[...\] She felt cold. Empty. After holding that much power, then having it ripped from her, she felt like she was nothing. A ripping feeling, then exhaustion. This looks similar to Kelsier's De-Ascension. Thanks for reading so far, and share your thoughts if you want!</TEXT>

    <TITLE>Can you tell the difference between a Windrunner, an Edgedancer, and a Stoneward?</TITLE>
    <DATE>2020-07-15 23:27:34</DATE>
    <TEXT>I have been looking at the Radiant Orders' [descriptions](https://www.brandonsanderson.com/the-ten-orders-of-knights-radiant) recently. I find that the tenets of the Windrunners, Edgedancers, and Stonewards have a lot in common at its core: Helping those who need it, no matter what (obviously, the Oaths would shape and apply restrictions to this). Below are my thoughts. Any tips on how to tell them apart are welcome! * Windrunners: I will protect. * Edgedancers: I will remember. * Stonewards: I will be there when I am needed. **Stonewards** I find that Stonewards share the most in common with both Windrunners and Edgedancers.  gt;They put the interests of others before their own, and will not bend their Ideals for the sake of convenience. \[...\]  gt;  gt;Most agree that the primary attribute of the Stonewards is their dependability. Though sometimes gregarious, they are never flighty. If a Stoneward is your friend, they will be there for you, and that is a core tenet of their Order #8212;to be there when they are needed. If somebody needs protection, it sounds like a Stoneward would do what's in his/her reach to protect him/her. Same with a person who has been forgotten. If a "being there when needed" situation is about protecting or remembering someone/people, I would not be surprised that a Stoneward would do it. **Windrunners** I might be interpreting the "protecting" part as something more abstract. The Oath "I will protect those who cannot protect themselves", sounds to me like an extension of/synonym to "I will help those who cannot help themselves".  gt;Windrunner oaths are themed toward protection, particularly defending innocents or those who are unable to protect themselves.  gt;  gt;The Windrunners tend to attract  #8220;big sibling #8221; types, who seek to protect the defenseless, but also enjoy action and fighting for what they believe in. For example, after the Everstorm passes, a distant town suffers a lot of wreckage, including many homes and farms. A squad of Radiants in the next city hears about this. I could expect that the Windruners are among the first in offering to lend their habilities for rebuilding the town or transporting the people affected to the city for shelter. Basically, they would be protecting them from the consequences of the wreckage. If they do it, isn't this also remembering those who have been forgotten (a distant, possibly irrelevant town)? What about being there for those who need it (they are helping those who might need it)? **Edgedancers** I might find this Order easier to tell them apart, but I feel that the distinction would not always apply.  gt;Edgedancer oaths are themed around remembering the ordinary people of the world #8212;those who aren #8217;t powerful generals or Radiants. Too often, the actions of the powerful have terrible effects on the people with no voice, and the Edgedancers consider it their solemn duty to remember that the people are the ones they truly serve. \[...\]  gt;  gt;One should never assume the Edgedancers are in any way base just because they often ignore high society; they are renowned as some of the most refined and graceful of Radiants. Basically, under the assumption that the three orders are similar, if the Radiant tends to help more the common folk than other kinds of people, is him/her more oriented to be an Edgedancer rather than, e.g., a Stoneward? I feel that Lift and Kaladin could have sworn each other Ideals so far, keeping the situations mostly the same (maybe the most difficult is their third Ideal). For example: Kaladin sees that Dalinar and the army have been betrayed by Sadeas, and are struggling against the Parshendi. He can either escape with Bridge 4 or risk their lives to try to save the army. He realises that even though they are Lighteyes, they are people who have been ignored (by Sadeas). They are still worth remembering. So he goes back with B4 and saves them (hey, they are putting other's needs before theirs, that sounds Stoneward-esque). For Lift, I could see something similar with Darkness, say he is the one she hates/is the least convenient for her to protect (since he wants to murder Radiants), but still does so. In this case, protecting him against his own madness. Also, Lift escaping the Bronze Palace, but deciding that protecting a defenceless Gawx is worth the risk, fits an "I will protect those who cannot protect themselves" situation (again, I fil this also has Stoneward vibes). Anyways thanks for reading so far, and share your thoughts!</TEXT>

    <TITLE>What if Destroy Evil, but literally?</TITLE>
    <DATE>2020-07-23 13:24:23</DATE>
    <TEXT>TLDR at the end. So there is actually an entity in the Cosmere named Evil: https://coppermind.net/wiki/Evil. Basically, it is the mythical entity of Threnody. Presumed to be a Splinter of Ambition after confronting Odium. What if the Command used to Awaken Nightblood "Destroy Evil" (capital "E") was literally killing Evil? In Warbreaker, Vasher ponders about Nightblood creation:  gt; With Nightblood, she and Vasher had spent much time in thought, then finally chosen a simple, yet elegant, Command. #160;  #8220;Destroy Evil. #8221; #160;  gt; It had seemed like such a perfect, logical choice. #160; There was only one problem, something neither of them had foreseen.  gt;How was an object of steel #8212;an object that was so removed from life that it would find the experience of living strange and alien #8212;supposed to understand what  #8216;evil #8217; was?  gt; Warbreaker - Chapter 51. This is from Vasher's POV. But what if Shashara had convinced Vasher to use specifically this command? Maybe this is the reason why she Returned? Since she died briefly after creating Nightblood. Why kill Evil? What would Edgli want to do in Threnody? Does the timeline hold? Did Ambition Splinter appeared before Nightblood was created? Is there a WoB that I am missing? Thoughts? **TLDR: Destroy Evil command, literally means destroying Evil, the Threnody entity.**</TEXT>
