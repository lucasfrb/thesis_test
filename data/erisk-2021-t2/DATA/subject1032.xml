    <TEXT>for me when i started selfharming i just wanted to hurt myself wasnt too obssessed with it but then u get into this hole of wanting to go deeper and deeper and then i started getting scars that actually stayed on my skin, i had this feeling that i was fucked up because i liked them. And me realising i was fucked up i wanted more scars so i can be seen as more fucked up because it finally validated my problems and struggles and trauma instead of just being a stupid phase.however as much as ik that i will never get "big enough" scars i still strive for it.</TEXT>

    <TITLE>I think I might have a mental illness...</TITLE>
    <DATE>2020-07-03 10:09:26</DATE>
    <TEXT>Look I don #8217;t wanna self diagnose because one it #8217;s just offensive to other and two because it could be totally wrong with my  #8220;self diagnoses #8221; and convince myself that I have those symptoms and not even know that those things weren #8217;t even a problem. I #8217;m a 15 year old female and autistic. I heard usually being autistic in its self can put u more at risk of a mental illness then trauma and bullying on top of it has got my risk of developing one through the roof. However that #8217;s not the reason I think I might have one or more mental illness, for around three years now I #8217;ve been depressed for three years and at first I thought telling all my friends about my problems and attention seeking behaviour would get rid of it but it didn #8217;t, then I thought trying to be happy would work but it didn #8217;t then I thought if I hid everything and do it on my own but it didn #8217;t. It isn #8217;t going away, and I #8217;ve been selfharming for three years aswell, I think the depressed feeling might have been longer than three years however ima day three because I actually knew something was up with me in those three years. And I know quite a few people who selfharm however I #8217;ve been one of the first people around me to selfharm and I #8217;ve been probably the last to stop because even tho I #8217;ve been clean for month I don #8217;t plan on stopping. This depressed state has also stopped me from showering and made me stay in my bed all the time even before lockdown. I am also overweight and school rlly made me feel worse so I #8217;d comfort eat every after school. I #8217;ve had panic attack before however anxiety hasn #8217;t rlly been a huge burden of mine it #8217;s mostly the depressed feeling and attachment issues. Yeah attachment issues, my father wasn #8217;t a good father at all he physically abused me as a child, he is long gone now which is good. But it #8217;s left me with horrible trust issues especially with adults, I #8217;d not trust every adult in the room however if one is nice or funny or chill even if there only 000.00000001% nice thats when I #8217;ll trust them and get attached, my old science teacher was nice and I remember breaking down crying at school and he was rlly nice, then when my poor mental health started getting even worse and would stop me from doing work because it felt like my brain was just telling me how much of a pathetic loser I am so I #8217;d usually stop doing work at school because I felt so horrible about myself, I #8217;d put my head down on the desk and sometimes I #8217;d cry trying not to let people notice I was upset and walk out so I #8217;d cry pretending I was asleep. My science teacher saw this and stopped me in the corridor while I was walking to my music lesson and he said I was acting strangely lately because I was usually a good student and a huge nerd however recently I seemed very off and upset he said if I needed someone to talk to I could go to him. The next time I had him, I told my friend and he convinced me into opening up, however I didn #8217;t know how to express what I was feeling to that teacher so it took many visits until I told him about my selfharm and he understood. He also saw me break down and cry in the corridor a lot and would actually help me. A lot of the teachers would just watch or give me space to  #8220;calm down #8221; even tho what I rlly need is someone to actually care. Then one day he stopped coming to school and we found out he moved to London to work at another school. I got so sad, because I was so attached to him, after a year of him leaving and I still miss him so much because he was the only adult in my life that actually cares. I was gonna open up about my trauma to him but he left. The attachment was so intense that every day if I didn #8217;t seen him in the corridor it would mean that it was a bad day. I #8217;d prefer being around him then my actual friends, and my dream would be him adopting me. I #8217;m so fucked. I also get this feeling a lot like everything around me is like a dream and nothing is real yet at the same time Ik I #8217;m in real life it just doesn #8217;t feel like it which would fuck with my head so much, my friend told me it might be dissociation however some people online says that it could be an autistic shutdown. However idk. I have more reasons however it #8217;s too long. I can #8217;t go to the doctor because my mother wouldn #8217;t let me because she doesn #8217;t know and doesn #8217;t care that I might be having mental health issues too not just her and my sister. I #8217;m stuck rn and idk what to do. This is why I wanna go back to sh cos I have no way of getting support unless I have multiple suicide attempts. I don #8217;t have the guts to kill myself but idc too much if someone ran me over, however at this point I might end up with suicide attempts or a successful one if I #8217;m left with no help for like months or years. But I kinda want that happen. Either way idk whether I should worry or not.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>To answer two of ur questions if someone told me I had a mental illness I just wouldn #8217;t be that suprised and kinda relieved that something finally makes sense. And if I didn #8217;t then I #8217;d be relived that it isn #8217;t as bad as I thought but I #8217;d be very confused of why I do those things. It is nice I can actually trust people. Might try that approach but I #8217;m 15 so I don #8217;t think they would take me seriously and going to the doctors alone would give me a panic attack. I #8217;ll try one day. If not I #8217;ll be dead.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>So i think my friend was about to kill himself yesterday because he gave me and other people in the friend group a good bye message on discord and omg I cried so much, I #8217;ve recently been numb for a while so when I saw that message I panicked badly (kinda shit that the only way I feel is extreme sadness) I kept on crying because he is one of my best friends, and I don #8217;t think I #8217;d live with myself if he died. I called my friends and we almost called the police before he texted us back saying he needed some space, we decided to give him his space however I #8217;ve felt on edge all day with this pit in my stomach waiting for something bad to happen, I #8217;m scared he might have said that just so he can kill himself and idk what to do. I wanna make sure he #8217;s safe. Idk how. However if he only wants space then maybe when I start checking up on him he might get annoyed and do something out of anger. I #8217;ve had my sister attempt before and I had to call the ambulance or else she would have died, Idk if my friends are feeling this anxious or if it #8217;s due to me experiencing this before.</TEXT>
