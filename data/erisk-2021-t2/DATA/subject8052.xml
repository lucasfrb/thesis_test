    <TEXT>I don #8217;t know for sure. I think she may have been on a one-year though(they are very common in the women #8217;s game) If it was only a 6 month I think they #8217;d have announced when they did Sari and Dom. It makes sense she was brought in at a time when we needed cover but with her age it would never have been long term. With Beattie coming in there was talk of her leaving at the beginning of summer but then nothing, then she played in the Emirates cup so I thought she was staying and then after that she wasn #8217;t in friendlies/training/photos so it was clear she #8217;d gone, I think they waited to announce when she actually had a club.</TEXT>

However I can't say for sure on these games (especially the BT Sport ones) because here in the UK the games shown on the app are all of the ones not broadcast on tv. Until the season starts it is unclear if they will be showing the games outside of the UK on the app or are just not having those games available on the app at all. The good news is highlights will be on the app.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>West Ham Women play at Rush Green Stadium in the clubs training ground. This is a one-off game (although games played at the main stadium are becoming more frequent). There #8217;s a variety of reasons why women #8217;s teams don #8217;t play in the main stadium. The main, obviously, is crowds. Even with much lower prices the stadium isn #8217;t going to fill up (not even a sell-out just to an acceptable level) every game. The league and teams themselves don #8217;t want to devalue the product by making the tickets free (although this does happen every so often) and they are dirt cheap already. With the stadium not as full the costs of matchday staff (ticket staff, cleaning etc) and security outweighs what is gained. Another thing is players have said that playing in full (again not even sell-out) stadiums is amazing but playing to almost empty ones with no atmosphere is not and they prefer their full smaller locations. The main take here is if you want them playing at the stadiums you have to go out and support them. Both when they play at London Stadium and at Rush Green. Edit: formatting for clarity</TEXT>

    <TEXT>It #8217;s a major gripe of mine every time he overlooks Williamson. Yes I #8217;m an Arsenal fan but she was the stronger part of the best defense in the league last season and was (depending on the metric you look at) either 1st or 2nd best progressive passer who plays in defense in the WSL last season too, the other player? Steph Houghton. If you want to play out from the back play those 2! You #8217;re right though, even if he doesn #8217;t go for Williamson, Bright needs to be dropped.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>You should be able to use the FA Player, it #8217;s not geoblocked (unless in one of the few areas that have broadcast deals). I #8217;m in the UK so not sure how to help but it may be that it #8217;ll be a slower rollout for those outside the UK. It may also be that when the games are on you can just watch without signing up. But like I said I #8217;m unsure. They did want people outside of the UK to view as well though.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Personally I think the predicted lineup in the article is pretty spot on. You #8217;re right about defense being hard to predict (for now) Beattie seems like she will be replacing Quinn as starter and then on the left/right I think it #8217;ll be where he thinks we need more defensive stability (Maier at right, Mitchell at left) or we can use attacking overloads (Evans at right, Veje at left) and this can be a case of overloading both sides or exploiting a weakness in one side whilst remaining stronger defensively at the other. Of course it all depends on fitness. I think midfield will be the hardest to predict when everyone is back. Attack should be pretty easy to predict every game. Due to Miedema picking up a knock it seems Mead will start centrally, with Evans on the right and McCabe on the left but when Miedema is properly fit it #8217;ll likely be Mead on the right.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I wonder if when she #8217;s back she #8217;ll be playing a new character or just not playing at all. It seems very unlikely that Yasha will have been freed before she is able to play again so will she just be on hold until they get there? Additionally it would, for me at least, seem out of character for Yasha to just rejoin them straight away rather than taking some time for herself. Of course if she were freed before Ashley was back then Yasha taking some time for herself would make a lot of sense.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I feel like it #8217;d be such a poor story for him to be evil, Fjords already had the switching allegiances because he was aligned with the wrong side (as it were) and I just don #8217;t think they #8217;d repeat that again. Additionally I feel like it #8217;d be one of the least interesting mechanisms for growth in Jesters character. If they do go for that I #8217;m sure they will make it work but it seems there are much better possibilities. That being said something will be going down at travellercon, I just don #8217;t think it #8217;s so clear cut as him being evil.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Honestly that would be great. Man City have done it, ambitiously yes but it gives them room to grow. I wish we would but I know it #8217;s a big chunk of change. Also name the whole thing or, at least, some stand after Vic Akers would be class. I #8217;ve wanted this for a while to be honest, Borehamwood is very hard for me to get to personally and the location is the only thing that holds me back from getting a season ticket. After helping with the refurb at borhamwood though seems unlikely.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>It touched on it in the article that in rugby they had decided that the team doctors were actually better at diagnosing the players as they knew them vs an independent doctor. I don #8217;t see why they can #8217;t have both. Let the team doc carry out the tests with an independent doc for oversight. I don #8217;t think faking would happen but it #8217;s an interesting thought. What would be the punishment for clubs trying that?...</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Not sure about this to be honest. There #8217;s no need to rush when it #8217;s just games that aren #8217;t important, heck they #8217;re only friendlies not even competitive games against teams that we should be able to roll over. The amount of players who pull out of the England squad with little injuries every time there are call ups is an ominous sign. I read that they #8217;ve been in contact with the club in managing her return but I feel like it #8217;s an needless risk for now. Obviously it doesn #8217;t mean she #8217;ll play, but if they #8217;ve no intent for her to even be on the bench she would #8217;ve just been mentioned as one of the extra 3 (I think) players who are joining up to train but are outside of the 20 man squad.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Sunil Chhetri has scored more international goals than Messi and is 2nd only to Ronaldo but people understand he #8217;s not playing in a comparable circumstance therefore he #8217;s not mentioned up there with them. What Chhetri has done is certainly impressive in its own context. What Kerr is doing is also very impressive. You don #8217;t need to try and make equivalencies where there obviously isn #8217;t one. I #8217;ll give you a time saving tip, it #8217;s dead simple I promise. If you #8217;re not interested in a post just scroll past it. Crazy I know but trust me it works! Now if you simply can #8217;t leave things alone there #8217;s another thing you can do. Reddit also has a voting system, very democratic, just stick a downvote on the post and (again) move on.

    <TEXT>See it #8217;s a little tiring seeing the same or similar comments all over the place when it comes to women #8217;s football. I do scroll past a lot but also I #8217;ve been trying something new, to mixed results admittedly. The NWSL has a 24 game regular season with 3 possible additional games. I think 18 in 24 isn #8217;t too bad personally although she #8217;s actually only played 21 (of 23 possible) this season. So 18 in 21 is even better. A comparison with the men #8217;s game, is that the 18/19 English Premier league top scorers had 22 goals in 36 (or 38 in Salah #8217;s case). Not that much higher in just a few more games. In La Liga Messi had 36 in 34 but below him it was 21 in 33 or 36 which again isn #8217;t too many more. Personally I #8217;m not the biggest fan of the NWSL, I think there are better leagues but that doesn #8217;t mean it #8217;s not a top league in the women #8217;s game. Like you said many many men get more than 18 goals a season, but not in the top leagues and with a few more games too. What she is doing, in the context of her circumstances is impressive.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>So your question was about what record she broke, basic reading comprehension should #8217;ve given you that answer but here we are. You then, fairly, complain that no one interacted with you regarding your actual question. Then when I do you ignore it. Seems the people replying to you aren #8217;t the only little bitches here. Not all of my posts are about women #8217;s football but I don #8217;t blame you for not going back far enough in my post history to see that (out of curiosity I just did this myself and it did take quite a while but the most recent was 81 days ago). You #8217;re right I #8217;ve posted a lot about it recently. Due to the growing popularity and ease of access when it comes to viewing games there #8217;s been a lot of people to talk to about the game. I #8217;ve been following since about 2002 and I #8217;ve never had so many people to talk about it with! Frankly that #8217;s exciting to me. Now the men #8217;s game I can have a lot of discussions about and it #8217;s great but there #8217;s something so fresh about discussing the women #8217;s game for me. So yeah I #8217;ve been posting a lot. Most of my posts are on subs dedicated to women #8217;s football however. I #8217;m not entirely sure it would be considered promoting it to post on a sub with people who already watch it but that #8217;s just my opinion. I would assume (and of course I could be wrong) that most of the games you #8217;ve watched were from the World Cup. I say this because I rarely hear commentary/analysis talking about equal pay when it doesn #8217;t have to do with the USWNT. Also, again, there aren #8217;t too many comparisons to the men #8217;s game. Usually the ones you hear are actually about stadium atmosphere. That being said I don #8217;t know what games you are watching, and with what commentary. We can both only talk from personal experience here. For me I mainly watch the FAWSL, UWCL along with international games and sprinklings of the NWSL and Frauen Bundesliga. I have to assume we aren #8217;t listening to the same commentary and analysis. Anyway, I #8217;m sure we could go on but it #8217;s getting late and I #8217;d rather not bring this into another day. There #8217;s big moves being made regarding Women #8217;s football in Scotland and maybe one day you #8217;ll enjoy watching them play, but it #8217;s likely you won #8217;t and that #8217;s fine. Sam Kerr is also objectively pretty amazing at her trade. Have a great life.</TEXT>

It #8217;s the same rubbish he does with Lucy Bronze (with any of them really) as if she were some nobody player before he came along. Leah had already won PFA Young player of the year, England women #8217;s young player of the year and continental cup player of the year.

    <TEXT>Exactly and the youth players coming through have very little to do with him, yes he #8217;s given them a chance but that #8217;s been after very successful youth international and club level involvement. No doubt Sampson had to go but it wasn #8217;t for footballing reasons (although I don #8217;t think we would #8217;ve gone much further under him). Personally I didn #8217;t like his footballing philosophy (too defensive for me) and I also think we were stagnating, but a lot of the foundations that he put in place have helped Neville.</TEXT>

From experience bbc sport usually don #8217;t post things like this until they are about 90% sure but obviously who knows what will happen. It seems the announcement won #8217;t be until the end of the season which makes it even more certain it #8217;ll be an NWSL coach- although I think everyone would #8217;ve been surprised if that wasn #8217;t the case!</TEXT>

Mitch on for Mead- push McCabe up, Filis on for Viv and Veje on for W #228;lti- put DvD central, doesn #8217;t seem like this game needs a proper dm but maybe dropping Jordan into the deeper role will give her game time and sharpness but will be less intense, similarly putting Kim there will be less intense considering the run of games she #8217;s been on.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I agree that we need to build a small stadium. Or at the very least move to an easier to get to location that can hold more people. I honestly believe what holds back our attendances is how hard it can be for a lot of people to get to Borehamwood. That #8217;s not going to happen anytime soon though after the money contributed to the new developments.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Unfortunately the women #8217;s team itself is a bit of a money sink. Although I agree as an investment it wouldn #8217;t be completely ridiculous. I think a lot needs to change in regards to the standing of women #8217;s football before a stadium would be considered. As a country we have so many options for football to watch and trekking up to places like Borehamwood is going to be enough itself to discourage people to go no matter the quality of the football unless they are local. I think the club needs to do a lot more increasing interest and bringing fans to the game. The FA/league is doing a bit but the club can always do more. I #8217;ve listed some basic ideas but I know this isn #8217;t really a relevant response to what you #8217;ve said so feel free to ignore them but I kind of went on one! I #8217;ve been following the team, as best I can, for as long as I #8217;ve been following football and I #8217;ve only attended a handful of games with none of them at Borehamwood. There #8217;s a few reasons but they all have in common how awkward it is to get to. As a kid my family who aren #8217;t into football didn #8217;t want to take me all the way there- I got to see mens games because it was easier. Now as an adult I unfortunately have a disability that affects mobility and while places like the Emirates or Wembley are manageable Borehamwood is not. -Put on a bus/coach service from the Emirates or even King #8217;s Cross to pick up fans and bring them to the game. Even if it #8217;s something that costs a little fee. It #8217;s more the complexity over price that affects travel to Borehamwood. -Screen games at the Emirates. Big league games and Cup finals/semis) -At least do audio commentary but video would be amazing on games that aren #8217;t televised (they recently did this for the champions league game v Fiorentina but not for the recent cup game against Charlton or Champions league game against Slavia Praha). I #8217;ve not been to one but I #8217;ve heard that previous ones for the men #8217;s team have been a good time. -I also think a cheaper membership that does not have the season ticket paired with it could be popular. I #8217;d become a member in an instant but spending  #163;70 (I think) when the bulk of that cost is due to a season ticket I can #8217;t use isn #8217;t something I want to do. Maybe to give extra value if they have screenings make those screenings members only or, cheaper for members or just advanced ticket access. Another idea is, if they put on transport to borehamwood, make it cheaper or free to members. -Have the women #8217;s fixtures on the app! I don #8217;t even mean streaming them, just getting Unless I #8217;m being an idiot and just can #8217;t find them but since they revamped the app you can #8217;t access the women #8217;s fixtures. -Put the women #8217;s things below the men #8217;s on the website- not below all the other rubbish. I can #8217;t check right now because of the game in an hour but you have to scroll past 4 or 5 different topics before getting to the woman #8217;s news. -Put the women #8217;s team name and numbers (and golden WSL badge!) back on the online store. -I will say recently the main Arsenal account has been interacting with the women #8217;s account a lot more (on Twitter at least) which is good. -And lastly, more of a pipe dream but... Maybe do a documentary like Chelsea Women are. Although last season would #8217;ve been the most amazing one!</TEXT>

    <TEXT>As far as I #8217;m aware before this year you were able to get the women #8217;s team name and numbers- I don #8217;t think you could get the badges though. I could be wrong because I only bought the 1st puma kit online and got my only other one in store but I #8217;m pretty sure they used to be there. Seems especially silly when not only is the woman #8217;s game at an all time high in interest but when we are the reigning domestic champions? The women were heavily featured in advertisements and have pre made shirts in store (anyone want a Carter 9) so it seems like a massive oversight.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Personally I think the main issue is the location of the regular pitches. Spurs usually play at the Hive in Barnet which is quite far (11.3 miles according to google directions) and Arsenal usually plays at Borehamwood FC in Borehamwood which is also pretty far (12.1 miles on google directions). This distance makes it very hard for fans to get to. I choose these two teams for the example as they were the big game obviously. Personally I #8217;m an Arsenal fan and I live a little outside of London so getting to the Emirates takes like 40-60 mins. While I #8217;d love to go I #8217;ve never watched us at Borehamwood (I #8217;ve seen us at Wembley, Kingsmeadow and the Emirates- couldn #8217;t make this last game at Spurs sadly) because it #8217;s very tricky to get to for me. The public transport there is really bad and the journey would take too long for early/late games and Sundays are a no go. I know this is a big problem for a lot of people, even those living in London. It #8217;s an issue repeated throughout the WSL where the team plays no where near or even outside of the cities. Then as others said in some places stadium capacity is the issue but, and I #8217;m not sure of the exact numbers, but I #8217;m not sure there are any clubs regularly hitting capacity.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>It is in men #8217;s football but that #8217;s not a condition in women #8217;s football. I #8217;m not sure many of the Scots from Arsenal will make it. Little will make it, provided she #8217;s fit. Beattie has a chance because of her prior understanding of playing with both Leah and Steph. I #8217;m not sure Mitch will make it, she #8217;s not been playing much and I #8217;m not sure he #8217;d rate her over Greenwood or Stokes. Evans is maybe the most 50/50 to me. She #8217;s got the versatility for RB or forward and versatility is key in the olympics but will he think she #8217;s better than Daly as that #8217;s essentially the role she #8217;d take? It might actually be in her favour that it #8217;s the same role because he might choose her in the basis of not being English, to boost the numbers per se. In terms of Welsh players I think Fishlock will be chosen if fit, it #8217;s a bit of a mess fitting all those midfielders in but again her being Welsh is unfortunately why I think she won #8217;t be overlooked (I also would like to say I think she #8217;s very deserving, I #8217;m just trying to guess his POV). Sophie Ingle might be another shout, again the midfield is congested but she has the versatility of being able to play at the back too. The reverse is Hayley Ladd who can play defense or midfield. Then Tash Harding is maybe an outside shout. I could see him picking Lee Alexander as a GK is a pretty unsafe position when it comes to his selections. Cuthbert should make it, Weir might make it. I #8217;m not sure of anyone else. Outside shouts for Emslie, Ross, Arnot and Godfrey but I reckon that would need amazing form and injuries from others.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I saw somewhere else London being mentioned. Whether it #8217;s a London club or not who knows but if it is, it #8217;s hard to guess who it would be. Chelsea surely are out of the question, purely because even without Kerr incoming the squad is stacked. Arsenal would be an interesting move, they could do with backup in that area with Dan Carter injured again but would Aluko accept being backup when she could be a starter elsewhere? Out of West Ham and Spurs I think Spurs is a better prospect but who knows, personally I think she would be a boost to either club.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>It #8217;s more understandable that in the women #8217;s game it is a popularity contest. Many games/leagues are difficult to watch and so names that people have heard of are often picked. Marta (who was an exceptional player) is still in these discussions for best player awards etc purely because she is such a big name and has been for a long time. Additionally in a year with a major international tournament that weighs very very heavily on the voting because it is more accessible even if it makes players like Rapinoe or Morgan who had terrible club form but had an impact at the tournament (and again are well-known names). I actually find it, unfortunately, understandable in the women #8217;s game. I think it #8217;s unacceptable in the men #8217;s game but that #8217;s kind of how most awards in any kind of media (music, film etc) go.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>So it #8217;s a bit of a chicken/egg scenario. Do you play in the smaller stadiums and wait for the demand to grow steadily and move onto bigger stadiums, however you limit accessibility. Or do you just put the game in the massive stadium and again wait for the demand to be there? It #8217;s fairly obvious why teams choose option 2. Money. Playing the game in the bigger stadium has much greater running and staffing costs. Even when areas of the stadium are shut. Additionally policing becomes an issue too. In 2018/19 it cost the Met police  #163;1,078,970 to cover games at the Emirates but Arsenal only paid  #163;55,490. It cost  #163;1,372,009 for the met to cover games at Stamford bridge but Chelsea only paid  #163;178,981. It cost  #163;747,931 for the police to cover West Ham (home) games but the club only paid  #163;41,973. People who aren #8217;t fans of football already complain at the cost of policing football coming from tax payers money. Even fans of football (men #8217;s not women #8217;s/both) will complain about taxpayers money going towards games at stadiums that likely won #8217;t be full. The clubs themselves certainly won #8217;t want to cover those costs. But even the players have issues with the bigger stadiums. I #8217;m not talking about the mental aspect of playing in front of so many people. I #8217;m talking about the mental aspect of playing in a visibly empty stadium. I #8217;ve seen many a player talking about how much it is draining to look out on empty seats and having a dead atmosphere. Players prefer the smaller, more intimate grounds where the atmosphere is booming (of course a full stadium with a booming atmosphere would be the most ideal!). The game would also immediately lose the openness it has, whereby fans can go up to the players after the game and get photos and autographs. Now this will inevitably happen and while that #8217;s sad it #8217;s a great thing however it #8217;s also currently a big drive for some people attending games. I don #8217;t know enough about stadium logistics in Mexico to comment on how they #8217;ve managed it and it is surely something the FA are looking at but I think it makes sense the way they are trying to sustainably grow the game. Look at Chelsea they are often packing out Kingsmeadow and maybe they need to look for somewhere bigger. Then look at City, they can #8217;t pack out their ground yet it only seats 7,000 and is around the corner from the Etihad so moving wouldn #8217;t help them! I think there #8217;s certainly a balance and I wish teams would play in better locations. Personally I could get to every Chelsea game but I can #8217;t get to any Arsenal game and I know fans where it #8217;s the other way around but I don #8217;t see much changing unfortunately.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>But surely this would only make the competition have less prestige and then the boost gained would negate itself. Is a short term boost worth the long term effects? Additionally the players already have pretty noticeable dips after international tournaments. How does increasing the frequency of the World Cup balance with the Olympics and the Euros/CONCACAF etc and then smaller tournaments like the Algarve, Shebelieves etc. I don #8217;t think it #8217;s possible, will clubs not release players for lesser tournaments? Will players not want to go for some tournaments in favour of others? How in the world will qualifying games for multiple tournaments be balanced. Surely long term sustainable growth is better than short term bursts of interest. I #8217;m not sure where you #8217;re at in the world but in England all of the talk after the World Cup was about the challenge of retaining the interest the World Cup brought. I think the FA here have done a decent job on that one domestically by increasing visibility and accessibility of games. Why can #8217;t fifa help to do that worldwide? Edit: I personally don #8217;t think that there is a lack of international football to watch. I just don #8217;t think it #8217;s accessible enough. That #8217;s what fifa needs to focus on! As well as all of that. Fifa recently announced the expansion of the World Cup to include more teams. This is obviously something that was always going to happen at some point but is the game actually ready. Sure there are teams that definitely missed out on playing that could #8217;ve done well, but the majority of additional slots will likely go to teams that can #8217;t yet keep up. If you think about that USAvThailand game, it #8217;s not Thailand #8217;s fault that they couldn #8217;t play against the USA, and it #8217;s not the fault of the USA that it was such a devastating score line. Because it was a bad score line for the game. Sure it happens in the men #8217;s game too, but no one wants or needs that in a game where every result like that is used as proof that the standards are poor. Improving the standards worldwide first is something fifa should focus on. People want to watch good, entertaining football. Make that possible and available everywhere.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>100% agree. There #8217;s other things fifa could and should be doing. This is just shortsighted and likely a cash grab. The US is an odd case to be fair. Everything #8217;s about international success even down to the league. It makes sense, international tournaments like the olympics and World Cup are more stable than any domestic league ever has been. It also matters more to the federations to use their players to win these tournaments rather than letting the focus of the players been on their clubs (with international call ups being a reward for good form) because someone #8217;s going to win the league anyway so may as well focus on winning more!</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Absolutely. I may be a little biased as I #8217;ve always preferred club football over international football but it #8217;s always been much more exciting for me to watch. The women #8217;s game has a long way to go worldwide to solve club level issues like the quality of clubs across the whole division etc but that #8217;s where grassroots level development worldwide will help. By increasing the level of coaching etc worldwide and domestically, by enlarging the talent pool and also refining the top talent the game can only grow domestically and internationally. It may be a case of a chicken and egg scenario but honestly I don #8217;t know why it needs to be. If it only cost like $3.5 million (not sure the exact number off the top of my head) for OL to essentially buy an NWSL club why can #8217;t fifa find some old ~~bribe~~ money floating around to support nations who need it. I know clubs work at losses and that will continue for a long time probably but if someone put the money in now they could be a main player for a long time.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Think she #8217;s dead on about not showing their full potential at the World Cup, it was disappointing and unfortunate and you #8217;ve gotta feel for some of the older players who deserved a chance to show themselves on that grand a stage and might nit get another chance. Reckon she #8217;s a shoe in for the Olympic squad. He #8217;s said already he wants to include some Scottish players so hopefully the squad will be more of a mix than the 2012 one, although I expect it to be mainly English/Scottish. However even if he were going to go for a  #8216;token Scot #8217; as it were she #8217;s the obvious choice. Barring injury it #8217;s surely impossible for her not to be picked. Of course she #8217;s right about closing that gap between English clubs and the top European ones and I want that to happen, but I also worry about it furthering the quality gap in the WSL. That being said while there definitely is a gap it #8217;s not like that of the other European leagues where one or two teams maximum dominate so that #8217;s reassuring at least. Should post this over in r/ArsenalWFC too!</TEXT>

Chelsea is an absolute no go as that would be strengthening actual rivals (also I love Mitch but that isn #8217;t a move that would boost them). Out of west ham and spurs I #8217;d rate spurs higher.

    <TEXT>I think if it wasn #8217;t for an overcrowded midfield/attack she would get more of a chance. Can you leave out Little/DVD/Nobbs/W #228;lti? So one gets pushed out wide. Then there #8217;s one spot for Mead/Evans/McCabe buuut he can fit all 3 of we don #8217;t actually play with 4 defenders. Considering last season we had one of the best defenses it worked well enough, but I #8217;d personally like more situational rotation with Maier/Mitch when we need to defend more.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>It #8217;s more that she can #8217;t easily move away from London (especially on a loan) like a male player could. One barrier is that the clubs in the WSL are varied with regards to providing housing or allowances for housing to players so the club can #8217;t even be relied upon to provide accommodation for her during a loan so staying in London was really her only viable option when it came to a 6-month loan. The options are then of West Ham or spurs, or to drop down a level which would be too low for her ability. Although you #8217;re right on the fact that unfortunately she #8217;s unlikely on 10k a week!!</TEXT>

    <TEXT>It #8217;s something that has interested me for a while now if I #8217;m honest. You see comments on interviews etc about how dumb some footballers are in the men #8217;s game (at Arsenal specifically the what do you know videos are a great example) and then you often hear how well spoken the female players can be and I think that #8217;s even evident in the kinds of questions they are asked. Due to the lower wages players world-wide pursue degrees alongside playing, often this can influence where they play. Then in addition to that, there #8217;s the unique beast that is the US game, where college football is the norm for almost all players and going professional straight out of high school is an oddity, Lindsey Horan is probably the biggest example. We are also seeing that while players in the men #8217;s game take on coaching badges when approaching the end of their career, it happens earlier in the career of female players.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>It may be against the grain but I think our squad would be perfect if we #8217;d kept Mitch and got another striker and defensive mid. Issue with a striker is that no good striker will sign for us, which is why we #8217;ve gone for a player like Foord who can do a job there but that isn #8217;t where she will expect to play. In terms of a defensive mid I really really wish we #8217;d have kept Dom.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>In terms of the squad it makes no sense but for the player it #8217;s completely understandable that she got a loan. I wish she didn #8217;t. I don #8217;t disagree that it #8217;s clear we need more players but come the next league game (barring injuries) we will have 2 more players in and hopefully W #228;lti truly does only have a small knock- although considering that #8217;s what was said about Little... I don #8217;t think we had many options in the winter window and we should see more in the summer. I hope we see more in the summer. In terms of the signings this summer, well we got 4 which isn #8217;t bad but lost 3. Losing Carter and Kemme in preseason is something no one could foresee and who knows what #8217;s going on with Veje. We can #8217;t be Chelsea with a bench better than many peoples first 11 however a better depth is clearly necessary and I agree we need more.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I mean it does specify men #8217;s top flight football, and considering 9 of the 12 teams are affiliated with men #8217;s clubs it makes sense. I think a lot of the time the statements come about because of being asked the question rather than specifically pushing for it. I don #8217;t blame the media (right now) either because it #8217;s a big talking point and understandably so. Ignoring the games called off for the storm the amount of games called as a whole league isn #8217;t too bad in my opinion. Liverpool are the stand out case and I think they do need to do better. Champions league winners and soon to be prem champions. Articles coming out about their state of the art training ground and Klopp getting old pitches relaid in contrast to the situation the women are in make these lines of questions happen.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I mean Chelsea is an anomaly and I don #8217;t understand what kind of magic Hayes is capable of but I am scared. In all seriousness it looks like they will be losing some great players in the summer though. For us, the winter window was disappointing but I don #8217;t think there were many players to pick up. We got Foord because of the way the American game works but no US national team players (or hopefuls) will leave the NWSL in an Olympic year and that #8217;s the level of player we should go for. I think (and hope) the summer window goes better for us. Losing Carter and Kemme in the summer was unfortunate and not something you can foresee, I don #8217;t know what #8217;s happening with Veje. Roord will be back next game which is nice. I am worried about W #228;lti though because both her and Little were supposed to only have small injuries. Loaning out Mitch was a mistake for the team in my opinion but for her personally I can see why it happened, after having issues last season would you want to sit on the bench in an Olympic year when you #8217;ve just missed out on a World Cup. Let alone what that must do to your confidence. We do need more players though.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>It #8217;s an interesting idea. I think if there #8217;s distinct enough names then it should easily work. I also think there #8217;s merit to the idea. Sure there #8217;s other, better bigger things to be done but I think of it like bug fixing in video games. Just because there #8217;s a big issue that affects lots of people it doesn #8217;t mean that a smaller issue shouldn #8217;t be, simultaneously, worked on. It just shouldn #8217;t be the main focus. I was talking to a friend who doesn #8217;t watch women #8217;s football the other day about how people can get so up in arms over here about calling football, soccer. But for me when I hear  #8216;football #8217; I think of men #8217;s and women #8217;s football but when I hear  #8216;soccer #8217; I think exclusively of women #8217;s football and I think that #8217;s because my exposure to the sport being called that is 95% NWSL/WPS/USWNT and then 5% being from the men #8217;s game.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>There are two main issues. The first is the choices of stadia in terms of capacity. The second is the choice of stadia in terms of location. The video talks about the record crowd at Wembley for that friendly and it just makes me a little sad because while I think (most) of the stadiums chosen are an ok capacity, we could #8217;ve been more ambitious. Sure some games are going to be lower draws but I think playing it safe is disappointing. In terms of location there #8217;s 3 stadiums in Manchester (although old Trafford is only hosting the opener), then one each in Rotherham and Sheffield and that #8217;s about as North as it gets. 3 in London (although Wembley is the final only) and then there #8217;s one each in Brighton and Southampton. The North East is completely overlooked. That #8217;s disappointing in general because there should be a better spread and it #8217;s a disservice to the fans up there. However I think it #8217;s doubly disappointing because women #8217;s football in England has a lot to thank for its roots in the North- just look at where a lot of the current squad are from.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I don #8217;t really think that #8217;s been our biggest issue. I just think we have had a bad go of it with injuries again. We have a squad of 19 (20 counting Mitch) I believe the limit is 24 or 25 which is up from the limit of 21 last season. Yes that #8217;s lower than I think everyone, but Joe, would like but it #8217;s not tiny.

This was all before it was announced Arteta had it. Presumably she #8217;s still in self isolation but I highly doubt she #8217;s been tested.</TEXT>

I think with experience elsewhere in the squad and talent in the same position it won #8217;t be an issue. Of course all of that being said form is king, if she has a resurgence why not?</TEXT>

    <TEXT> #8220;In conclusion, Lisa Evans is one of the most important players in the Arsenal Women team, and yet is one of those who sometimes don #8217;t get as much notice as they deserve. #8221; In my opinion she #8217;s one of the most underrated players both for us, and in the WSL and I #8217;m so happy that this might help people to see her importance!

    <TEXT>I actually don #8217;t mind the delay. I think playing the olympics and the Euros in one summer is too much. Sure the men will do it but there #8217;s only 3 over 23 players allowed so at the amount of players who could do both are slim. In terms of men #8217;s and women #8217;s Euros, sure it would be great if as many people were as excited for the women #8217;s Euros as the men #8217;s but we #8217;re not there yet. So what will likely happen is a few scenarios. One, people who are excited for the men #8217;s Euros and would tune in to the women #8217;s but not as fervently will likely be a bit done with football by the time the women #8217;s matches start. Two, people who would tune in because it #8217;s football (like the World Cup last year) will again likely be a bit overloaded at that point. Obviously people who will watch both and people who wouldn #8217;t watch the women #8217;s will not change. Having the olympics won #8217;t help with both football fatigue and live sports fatigue in general. Lastly the marketing for the women #8217;s game will likely suffer due to higher levels of marketing for the men #8217;s game.</TEXT>

I can #8217;t say it #8217;s his choice, he wasn #8217;t even involved then but it #8217;s someone #8217;s. All that being said Phil definitely has his favourites.

    <TEXT>So earlier today most articles said it would be announced tomorrow- I didn #8217;t bother posting because that seems silly to post that something will happen. But then the Times came out with this (paywalled), and after that was the guardians article. 2 separate sources was enough for me to decide to post. Obviously until the official announcement it #8217;s not 100% but these writers are respected in the woso world so I trust it. I agree it would be nice to just rebuild now. Take the time we have now with nothing going on that needs a manager- obviously there #8217;s contact between England and players but I doubt he #8217;s important to that- and search properly for the right person. When it was first said that they #8217;d announce his future tomorrow I definitely thought it #8217;d be an extension, so like you said this is a win!</TEXT>

    <TEXT>The NWSL is a better league, there #8217;s no question in my mind. On a whole the clubs are more balanced. I think the WSL can easily surpass the NWSL however. The draft system and trading are quite off putting when you don #8217;t understand it. Personally I prefer the traditional contract/transfer method. I think it #8217;s better for players and better for clubs. However for a growing league with financial imbalances there #8217;s a clear difference between your Chelsea #8217;s and your Readings. Whereas while there are clearly stronger teams, the NWSL has a better balance. The college system and academies are in a sort of weird place. They don #8217;t seem opposed to each other as they are at different stages of a players development. But the pathway through to a team is much more muddied than that of a European academy. To me the NWSL and USWNT are a weird area too. The league seems set up equally to be a league as it is to support the team. The USWNT functions more like a club than a national team. The amount of time they spend together is crazy. I think it would take one USWNT starter to decide to move to the WSL or even another European league for that balance to break down. I don #8217;t mean a player at the end of their career like HAO, a short loan like Lloyd, a player at the beginning like Horan or when the league folded like Heath. Someone who is essentially a guaranteed starter. Because then what happens? Would they get left off the roster? That incentive (or threat?) for bigger name players to stay in the league would be gone. I think that will be a turning point. Just like Sam Kerr essentially forced the salary cap increase it could happen again. I think it will have to happen again regardless. I #8217;ve been typing this in between playing warzone with my friends so it #8217;s taken over an hour and I #8217;ve forgotten my actual point however I hope that I got some of it across. TL:DR NWSL best. FAWSL in a position to surpass but not there yet.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I think it #8217;s an excitement thing. People think balance = any team being able to win = excitement. I don #8217;t know that I necessarily agree with that. I #8217;ll preface by saying I #8217;m an Arsenal fan. I personally think relegation battles are the most exciting and intriguing games to watch. A battle for the league is always great and if/when we get an additional European allotment then 3rd place will heat up too. There #8217;s something to be had for better balance throughout the league though. When Arsenal beat Bristol 11-1 that was bad. I remember Lucy Bronze tweeting after and then she was blasted by people talking about the balance in France and Lyon particularly. Personally I don #8217;t think that 11-1 reflects the league as a whole. We got thrashed by Chelsea twice. Chelsea who just about held Liverpool to a draw when Liverpool have had an atrocious season. Yes there #8217;s a clear top 3, a clear middle set and a clear bottom set but the balance is better than it seems in my opinion. It #8217;s a hard thing to tackle because I don #8217;t think clubs should be hamstrung to preserve balance if they are willing to invest. I think more so than the issue of clubs stockpiling players/ top talent is actually the staff/training setup. That #8217;s where the fa should try and enforce more balance. The difference a GK coach makes for example is astounding. If the Fa can get clubs to, not a level playing field, but a good baseline in terms of training etc then there will be real gains in balance rather than stopping Chelsea holding all of the players.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I was reading something fairly recently about the plan for the forwards that final. Foord was playing only her 2nd game and was supposed to keep width on the right hand side and then instead of playing DvD wide left we played Nobbs there and DvD more centrally which obviously changed the dynamic our forwards usually have. In regards to being mentally there, it #8217;s hard to tell. Could be fatigue. It #8217;s not been an easy season. I #8217;d have to watch again but while there were momentum shifts throughout the game overall I felt we were on top and could #8217;ve won. Berger had the game of her life (which considering her ability is saying something!). Last years conti cup final we were ravaged by injuries (again). Our bench was a keeper, 2 kids and an unfit Miedema. From what I remember it was a fairly even game, City probably had the better chances but if we #8217;d have had Miedema fit from the start I think we would #8217;ve won (again trying to remember my thoughts at the time). It was a massive kick in the teeth to lose on pens, which if we #8217;d been outplayed it probably wouldn #8217;t have felt like. 2018 FA Cup final was awful, and not just because I was somehow sat with a load of Chelsea fans in the Arsenal area. I don #8217;t want to seem like I #8217;m blindly defending the manager/team as there #8217;s definitely faults and it #8217;s something to question for sure but 2 of the 3 finals I genuinely think we were the better team and should have been able to win. I also am unsure if I could say we choke in finals. Obviously losing 3 of 4 it #8217;s hard to say otherwise but if you look at similar high pressure, big important league games- and I #8217;m talking high intensity ones that mean a lot like Birmingham last season, not ones that if you lose you can make up like Chelsea this year- we #8217;ve faced that pressure and won so I #8217;m unsure.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I get the same impression. To be honest I don #8217;t see him being a good fit for international management. Both here and at Melbourne it was clear he brought in players that fit his playing style. That #8217;s absolutely fine for club football but not really for international management. That #8217;s not a negative, I think it #8217;s possible to be a great club coach or great international coach but not both. Getting a good manager is just as hard as it was a few years ago, maybe more so because they #8217;ve said they #8217;d prefer a woman if possible. I don #8217;t know who they #8217;ll go for, Hayes and Stoney are definitely top targets but I don #8217;t believe the timing is right for either. Just got to hope it #8217;s someone good, personally I #8217;ll take almost anyone with optimism, but I did the same with Neville despite his experience or lack thereof. I want to say it can #8217;t be worse but I #8217;m sure it can.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>For sure! It definitely seems recently that having Champions league is detrimental to league performance. Then on top of that can international games/competitions safety continue next season and then if they can can clubs afford to participate? Sure the men #8217;s champions league will go on regardless of safety because money but that same reason might push the women #8217;s CL to a new format or even skip a year. Clubs like us or PSG etc will be fine but for teams like Slavia Praha, who we faced this year, it could be a tricky time</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Money. I mean this in 2 ways. First the money isn #8217;t there for clubs to be able to safely resume the season. This covers lots of things like contracts etc but mainly testing. Unlike in Germany where the bundesliga clubs banded together to fund testing for the Frauen Bundesliga, the WSL clubs would have to produce that money themselves. Secondly because the league/clubs don #8217;t make that much money the pressure isn #8217;t there like it is on the Prem to see out the season, safety be damned.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>It seems most likely to me there will be no champion. With PPG (weighted and unweighted) Chelsea go 1st (and we stay 3rd) so it could be a case that they #8217;ll make Chelsea champions but I think that #8217;s a little unfair on City. The fairest thing in my opinion would be to give Chelsea and City the champs league spots but have no actual champion.

    <TEXT>I think part of the reason they #8217;ve delayed so long was with a view to do that but with contracts ending and players/clubs just wanting to have clarity (so they can return home or begin planning etc) they have had to put something out as patience was running thin. With players like CSK announcing she #8217;s leaving you guys I think they decided to just go for it. I #8217;d hope that anything could help you invest in the women #8217;s game but at this point it would be surprising.

Sure it #8217;s all well and good taking their time, especially right now when they have time but I don #8217;t think it #8217;s because they are being thorough , I think it #8217;s because they #8217;re stumped.

    <TEXT>This was part of their statement-  #8220;Following overwhelming feedback from the clubs, the decision to bring an end to the 2019-20 season was made in the best interest of the women #8217;s game. This will also enable clubs, the FA Women #8217;s Super League  amp; Women #8217;s Championship Board and the FA to plan, prepare and focus on next season when football returns for the 2020-21 campaign. Supporting the welfare of the clubs and players will continue to be our primary concern throughout this process, which also involved a robust and thorough examination of the logistical, operational and financial challenges that the game currently faces. #8221; Undoubtedly money played a big role but I think it was more that they looked at the financial loss of discontinuing vs the financial cost + safety risk to players/staff of continuing. Unlike the prem (which is separate from the FA) it doesn #8217;t make the big bucks and so, I think, player safety is more of a concern but also disinterest in the logistical nightmare that continuing encompasses.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Obviously solid squad depth is an issue. I don #8217;t think I really need to say more on that. One of the biggest things I think we need to work on is being less structured. Which sounds crazy considering how we play. My issue is more with the patterns of play. We are pretty predictable. There #8217;s not really any surprises and that #8217;s not necessarily a bad thing. Just because a team knows what we will do doesn #8217;t mean they can stop it. But some can and then we struggle. Considering the calibre of players we have and the creativity they possess we can look so incapable when teams stop us. I #8217;d like if we had 1 or even 2 other formations solidly down so that if one thing isn #8217;t working we can switch it up. He tried a new formation against Chelsea and we got smacked. It doesn #8217;t mean that #8217;s a bad thing it was just poor timing to try something they #8217;d been doing for (I think it was) at maximum a week in training. I #8217;d also like more wide wide players. We cut in a lot. Yes Miedema doesn #8217;t like headers, but not only is she very capable we have a lot of players who are good in the air (also DVD is great in the air and usually left fairly free on crosses). Playing out wide also can create cut back opportunities with the CBs and we have two of the best passing CBs in the league. I do think Foord will help with some width however. A backup Striker. I #8217;m sorry to say I think DCs time at the club is up. I don #8217;t know when her contract is up but if not this season then that gives us a bit longer to find the right person. Viv can #8217;t do it all and she shouldn #8217;t be needed to beat Lewes on a midweek game. Also bring back and keep Mitch.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>In my opinion it is and it isn #8217;t. Different options with different strengths is, of course, a great way to reduce predictability. However I knew that most of the replies here would probably be on squad depth and while that is probably our biggest issue I wanted to engage with other issues I think we have, but as well as that, I think it #8217;s important that we get players who genuinely add quality more than just numbers. That all being said, utilising the players we have in different ways can be very effective. In the Conti cup final we played DvD centrally and Nobbs out on the left which really changed the dynamic of our attack. If we had drilled small changes (in addition to another formation entirely) like that; positional swaps, different passing lanes etc then we would have multiple fall backs when we can #8217;t break a press or when we have no subs left (or no viable subs on the bench...) etc. Think of the difference when we play Evans at RB and Mead ahead of her vs Maier at RB with Evans ahead of her (Maier is quite attacking too and I #8217;d prefer the left side as an example but I don #8217;t know how much you #8217;ve seen of Mitch + McCabe). There #8217;s always overloads and always overlaps because that #8217;s how we play but it allows for differences in our build up. Montemurro says he likes versatile players, and that #8217;s evident in the players he buys but we tend to only see that versatility when they #8217;re desperately plugging a hole left by injury. If he #8217;s the right man for the job?.. I #8217;m not sure I #8217;d say he isn #8217;t. If you remove the fact our squad is small (which while it obviously is there #8217;s other factors than just him regarding that) what are the other shortcomings? That game you mentioned against Chelsea was definitely his fault. Another question mark is our record in finals with him. Outside of those there #8217;s none springing to mind right now (although I #8217;m sure there are others). I don #8217;t want to blindly defend him for sure but I also don #8217;t think that he #8217;s necessarily a problem (yet). I mean we won last season with an injury crisis. We were in the final 8 of the champions league and pushing 2nd this season with an injury crisis, that #8217;s not too bad in my opinion. A bigger squad is needed, there #8217;s no denying that. Maybe more fitness/ s amp;c coaches or medical staff too but I think we have the right head coach for now.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>England has sports in college but they #8217;re not like college sport in the US. For football specifically (and my example is more on the men #8217;s side because setups are pretty uniform whereas in the women #8217;s side it really depends on the backing but the overall approach is the same just less professional I guess) teams will have their own youth systems and players will go through the ranks (from like U8s, U10s, U12s etc) and then either get an academy scholarship* (I believe that #8217;s like 15/16- 18 years old) and then they either get a professional contract or be released by the club. Aside from GCSEs and A-Levels I don #8217;t believe many male players go further studying while playing (with the exception of their coaching badges) *Again in women #8217;s football it #8217;s a little different here. I don #8217;t know if they use the term scholarship. But if they #8217;re still good enough they will progress in the U16s and U18s. The next step up is again a contract (players in the unders can play for the 1st team) but whether it #8217;s a professional contract depends on if the club is in the WSL or if not, whether the club offers a professional or semi professional contract. Female players will often attend Uni or study alongside playing football because obviously it #8217;s not as financially viable as the men #8217;s game. This is a bit more basic than it actually is obviously but even with that it #8217;s long.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I wasn #8217;t surprised either, although I am surprised that her contract wasn #8217;t up so hopefully we get a fee. I wouldn #8217;t be too worried, this happens most years with short contracts. The only real shock was Flores and while she #8217;s a great prospect she never played a competitive game so it won #8217;t have a huge affect (hopefully). It seems there will be a couple more outgoings but if you look at most other clubs they #8217;re in the same boat. The only real negative for us is if the champions league does continue we will have lost players, but again I #8217;m not too worried.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>It opened earlier today, however because of COVID a lot of signings/announcements are being delayed for various reasons. I #8217;m sure we will start hearing things soon. If you look at our releases (and I believe there #8217;s still a couple more unannounced) only one has actually confirmed a new club thus far and that #8217;s consistent not just throughout the league but leagues around the world. Obviously they #8217;re going somewhere but everything #8217;s been slowed down a little. I #8217;d love if she came back but I #8217;d be pretty surprised, but who knows!</TEXT>

The only reason I #8217;d be surprised if she came back is that she #8217;d be second fiddle, both upfront and out on the wing. I didn #8217;t realise her contract was running out and it #8217;s a shame for Everton as they seemed to really be building something but she could be number one for a lot of clubs. If she wants to stay in England Man U could be a great move</TEXT>

    <TEXT>While I agree the chances are slim at Chelsea, the same can be said for the Arsenal team. There #8217;s Williamson and Carter from the academy and then you can include Beattie, Little and Nobbs as U20 but personally I find it hard to count them as a fair reflection because it was so long ago and in a definitely different regime. Many great prospects have been leaving Arsenal in recent years, either to go to college in the US or to different clubs for 1st team football (Lauren James, Chloe Kelly, Anna Filbey, Carla Humphrey etc)</TEXT>

    <TEXT>This sort of turnover is pretty standard in women #8217;s football, it #8217;s echoed across the league, due to much shorter contracts. Only one player who has left has been surprising and of the players who have left (or are still to leave) only one played with any kind of regularity and she was the 2nd choice GK. Edit- for anyone a little worried this is a good explainer of our situation. https://arseblog.news/2020/06/arsenal-women-a-summer-of-evolution/</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Not exactly a mass exodus just regular squad turnover, it happens with the shorter contracts in the women #8217;s game. None of these players (bar PPM) have been any kind of regular player and even if they were offered a contract why would you stay if you know you won #8217;t play? We do have to play CL, I think if we wanted any of these players to play we #8217;d have had to have offered them short term extensions, I would be very surprised if their new clubs would agree to that due to the timings of pre season and the CL conclusion. It #8217;s very much not ideal but these contracts were expiring anyway and it #8217;s no ones fault the CL got delayed. Just something we have to deal with. She was interviewed (remotely, she was at home) because she played for Essen before joining us. When Bayern played they had Evans on at half time (again remotely)</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Unfortunately not, the contact runs to a certain date (presumably 30/6) and that #8217;s that competitions be damned. Quinn played 6 games with 3 starts this season (WSL only) in comparison Beattie (who essentially replaced Quinn) played 10 with 9 starts and was injured for most of the winter and Schnaderbeck who played 10 and started 10. Veje and Carter have had massive injury issues and I guess the club decided to move on without them. The rumours are that incomings will largely be the same as outgoings and so the squad size should remain stable. As with everyone else I #8217;d prefer we have a couple more players but I also don #8217;t think the squad is as small as it seems. Personally until the transfer window closes I #8217;m not going to worry. I #8217;ve not seen any proper Arthur links (aside from her existing connections to our players) and I would be surprised if we signed her (both for the club and for her) but who knows...</TEXT>

    <TEXT>12 apps 5 starts in the league this season from 15 poss. I wouldn #8217;t say she #8217;s unimportant but certainly not as important as she once was, or rather could #8217;ve been. Her form has always been patchy in my opinion, the skill and talent is there but consistency? With the signings (including Kerr from the winter window) and the return from injury from Kirby her chances are likely to dwindle further. Only had a year left on her contract (I may be wrong) so probably better for the club to get some money, but more importantly for her to get her desired level of playing time.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>When I first read I didn #8217;t take it as her leaving, I just assumed she was spending time until the club needed her (which could be a while) back in Sweden. Reading it again however (and maybe I #8217;d missed a couple words) it certainly seems like a goodbye. Actually quite sad about that. It seemed a great fit for club and player. Lord knows the pride needed to shore up their defence and for her, while she #8217;s still good enough to kick it in a top league I think the past couple clubs she #8217;s been at have been a bit too much for her to get consistent time. It #8217;s sad and I hope it #8217;s not the end but who knows.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I think she #8217;ll be a good signing. Takes a lot of long shots, like a lot. Good on set pieces. I prefer her playing more attacking but she can do a job defensively. I #8217;m not sure where she #8217;d slot in though with Groenen and Zelem but that #8217;s an exciting issue!

    <TEXT>They can #8217;t play for us, unfortunately. Regardless of signing before- which I don #8217;t believe they did- they #8217;d need to be registered. We know who was and wasn #8217;t registered (eg Mitchy was an arsenal player but out on loan so not registered for us) so if they were registered, the signing would #8217;ve been announced back then but additionally the club wouldn #8217;t waste a registration on a player who (to their knowledge) wouldn #8217;t have played. That being said, my assumption is that one of two things happened. Either early approaches were made (like you said November/January etc) but we just made a pre contract agreement to sign them upon the expiration of their contracts (so a free transfer). Or we made early contact but for various reasons (transfer discussions with club or contract discussions with player/agent etc) took longer than the January window allowed.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>There #8217;s been a few things about this over the years with a few different players, the one that always comes first to my mind is Horan. There #8217;s more to find if you wanna look with other players too but on a quick search I found this article- https://www.theringer.com/soccer/2019/6/7/18651308/womens-world-cup-uswnt-lindsay-horan-psg-france-portland-thorns The key bit-  #8220;She returned to Paris after the World Cup and earned her spot back in the PSG starting lineup. But as the 2016 Olympics approached, Ellis let Horan know that if she wanted to play in that tournament, she needed to be playing professionally in the United States. U.S. Soccer pays the salaries of national team members who play in the National Women #8217;s Soccer League (between $62,500 to $67,500 a season in 2017), in hopes of boosting the fledgling league using the USWNT #8217;s star power. In addition, the league #8217;s season is structured to accommodate the national team #8217;s training schedule. #8221;</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I genuinely think that last part is the main edge that the us has now. There #8217;s no doubt they have outstanding players in every position and their expectations of themselves are sky high but that #8217;s the area where no other country can ever match or beat them. It #8217;s so much more like club football than international football</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Presumably this is the important bit-  #8220;Perhaps the most alarming part of the Spurs statement, though, is the club said the women #8217;s team splits training between The Hive and Hotspur Way  #8220;based on logistical requirements and in compliance with regulations pertaining to gender appropriate changing areas. #8221; Shuffling in between training grounds is hardly ideal for a professional team, but the suggestion that one of these locations does not have women #8217;s locker rooms is shocking, and may be what Morgan was alluding to in her comments. #8221;</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Yeah if he #8217;s not going to take the US job (and we don #8217;t know that he was definitely offered it but all signs...) I doubt he #8217;d take the England job. Like you said the Australia job is different because it #8217;s home that being said I don #8217;t see him as an international manager. It #8217;s not a slight to his abilities but I don #8217;t think he #8217;d be a great national team manager. If you look at how he builds his squads he definitely picks specific players and that pool is so so much lesser with a national pool. I #8217;m sure he could do a good job don #8217;t get me wrong but I think his strengths lie in club management</TEXT>

    <TEXT>It seems to be but it just shows how the NWSL is second fiddle unfortunately. To me if she #8217;s not fit to play more than 30 mins she #8217;s probably not fit to play and the spirit medical staff would/should call that. If they do, but decide to risk that 30 mins as like a break glass in emergency situation that #8217;s fine. The fact that someone outside of her club gets to decide that just doesn #8217;t seem right.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>That #8217;s maybe the weirdest part of this specific situations, the fact there #8217;s nothing upcoming matches or camps. I can understand that position, and it #8217;s clearly worked for the US! Personally I #8217;ve always preferred more of a balance. Club = country as in when called up sure country is king but outside of camps/matches club is. A level of cooperation in regards to injury management is needed too but for me that #8217;s club first. I #8217;m curious about your opinion on players being played in different positions at club level purely to benefit the USWNT rather than need/want by the club?</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Well the U23s are at Colney, probably because they (or specific individuals) can train with the 1st team and therefore are mixing whereas there #8217;s no situation where the men #8217;s and women #8217;s team needs to mix. That being said Hale End usually serves the U23s down to U8s (I think, or maybe U13s). And presumably they will be reintegrated into training over time. For now remaining at Hale End is easy but, after some time, having all the squads there may make it harder to control the situation than the women being back at Colney.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>As someone who is quite interested in both (various) esports and woso it #8217;s definitely a comparison that 100% fits and intrigues me. I think football in general, but woso perhaps more so, has been looking at engaging social bases more like esports brands have been in recent years. Not too many years ago a big team visiting a country or region was enough to keep fan support but now with access to so many more avenues it isn #8217;t just the top 10 clubs worldwide that can garner support and so growing your online presence but also having continual and consistent interaction with those already interested is key.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Eh, they need short term depth upfront and it #8217;s likely a very easy deal because of the links between clubs and likelihood of more NWSL games. Her contract with Reign is up on 31/12 so it kind of seems perfect in that regard.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>**Viki Schnaderbeck - An open letter (*google translation*)** A few weeks ago a gay footballer playing in the English Premier League wrote an open letter about keeping his sexuality a secret, which was published in the Daily Mirror and in the Sun, and it made big waves. One of the statements was:  #8220;The truth is I just don #8217;t think football is ready yet for a player to come out. The game would need to make radical changes in order for me to feel able to make that step. #8221; And at this point I would like to speak up. I want to raise my voice. I #8217;m not going to make a radical change, but I want to make a contribution and take responsibility. In order to be able to talk about homosexuality in an unbiased, liberated and free manner as a professional soccer player, it takes a lot of courage and, last but not least, overcoming. Although the wishful image of an emancipated, developed and tolerant society exists, reality is still strongly shaped by prejudices, taboos and heteronormative attitudes. I made a conscious decision at the end of last year to make my relationship with my girlfriend public. I felt ready and wanted to finally put an end to the little lies. I wanted to live unrestricted and free and to be 100% myself. Was it difficult for me? Naturally. I #8217;m in public and have a certain fan base. The media and fans will react to it - that was clear. However, not to what extent and in what form. But I became more and more aware that I have to make one single decision for myself: Do I want to live my life as freely and unrestrictedly as I want or do I want to live my life so that I can please heteronormative programmed people? The answer was clear and I felt ready: I  #8203; #8203;want to publicly confess that I am a lesbian. But one thing is important to mention at this point. Viktoria Schnaderbeck at the age of 20 or 25 would have acted differently. When I was 20 I would have told myself that it was just a phase. I would have lied and played something to many people around me. I still remember very well the day when I cried when my mom asked me  #8220;whether I had a girlfriend? #8221; I burst into tears because I was ashamed, felt guilty, and simply couldn #8217;t stand by my sexuality. It #8217;s also important to mention that my parents never had a problem with my sexual orientation. It was just myself who had a problem, a big and deep one. At the age of 25 I would have convinced myself that it is sufficient for my family and friends to know, but for my professional and extended environment to remain excluded. Today, at the age of 29, I don #8217;t tell myself anything, but know that I like women. Today I know that sexual orientation is not important at all. That it doesn #8217;t matter what gender I love. Much more important is that I love. I also believe that sexuality becomes important primarily through society. That #8217;s why I want to take on social responsibility. I want to contribute to a better, more tolerant and peaceful world. The more we talk about it, the sooner we create a framework where people no longer need to be ashamed. A framework in which taboos on the subject of sexuality are broken and stigmatized ways of thinking are discarded. In the 21st century there must be no place for homophobia, racism, sexism or any other form of discrimination. Our planet - including the football stadium - should be a place for diversity, inclusion and fairness. Football is football. And love is love.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I agree on the community shield however as long as it #8217;s around they may as well take advantage of the exposure it could offer. If it #8217;s on BBC 1 some people may just put it on and that can only be a good thing. I hate double headers. It #8217;s never good whether the women #8217;s game is played before of after the men #8217;s game. It #8217;s awkward for the fans that do bother and (presumably) disappointing for the players/clubs those that don #8217;t bother. But this double header without any fans already could be really good. Sure some people will only tune in for  #8220;the main event #8221; but others will give it a go and even people catching the last 15 may have their interest piqued. Personally I #8217;ve always been of the mind that part of the challenge of being in addition cup competitions is managing minutes/fixture issues etc. But I also think it #8217;s very different for the women vs the men. Because our league is much smaller if you take out the Conti cup there #8217;s whole periods where no games would be played. Obviously clubs in the champions league have more but I looked at Arsenals results. We played 6 games in September (1 conti cup, 2 UWCL) 5 in October (1 conti cup, 2 UWCL) 4 in November (2 conti Cup) 4 in December (1 conti Cup) 6 in January (2 Conti Cup, 1 FA Cup) 4 in February (1 Conti Cup, 2 FA Cup). We also had one game in February postponed that didn #8217;t get played. From that, for a team in every possible competition, 3 (poss 4) months had only more than one game a week (on average). That #8217;s not a massive workload in my opinion. Maybe if/when the league is expanded teams in the UWCL should be out of the Conti Cup but even then I #8217;m not sure that would be my preferred resolution. Personally I think the Conti Cup needs to change its format. The group stage seems a bit off, but that might be me.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>A lot of people are saying, specifically USWNT players, that players would need to or should only join Arsenal/Chelsea/Man City but if game time is the most important then essentially any club with a decent standard of training facilities should be enough. Of course money is a consideration but I #8217;m of the opinion that if players specifically want to play then they #8217;ll be agreeable to a reasonable wage.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>So I subscribed once to read an article and they won #8217;t let me delete my account without calling so this is the 2nd time I #8217;ve used it!  #8216;The FA could be forced to wait until after next year #8217;s Olympic Games if they press ahead with plans to appoint Sarina Wiegman as the new head coach of the England senior women #8217;s side. Wiegman, who led her Holland side to European Championship glory in 2017 before losing to the United States in last year #8217;s World Cup final, has emerged as the favourite to succeed Phil Neville ahead of Jill Ellis, who won back-to-back World Cups with the US but may be considered too expensive. However, Wiegman signed a new contract with the Dutch FA last December and, sources in the Netherlands understand, has a desire to take her side to the Olympic Games in Tokyo before moving on. Neville is contracted until next July and has intimated he would be prepared to extend his stay with the FA for another few weeks and take a British team to the Games. That may be a situation Baroness Sue Campbell, the director of women #8217;s football at the FA, has to consider given the financial situation at the national governing body. With 124 staff due to be made redundant and the FA facing potential losses of  #163;300 million as a consequence of the Covid-19 pandemic, Campbell is not in a position when she can have two national women #8217;s coaches on the payroll. Ellis was the early favourite for the job but the 53-year-old #8217;s salary requirements, rumoured to be as much as  #163;700,000 a year and therefore more than double Neville #8217;s pay packet, do present a challenge. Wiegman, so highly regarded in the Netherlands that the Dutch FA have honoured the 50-year-old with a statue, would probably come cheaper  #8212; closer to  #163;400,000 a year plus staff  #8212; given that at present she is paid considerably less. #8217;</TEXT>

    <TEXT>It #8217;s not so much that we had any choice to not let this happen. She #8217;d left us for UNC. We may have offered her a position but her game time would be worse than last season, firstly because hopefully we won #8217;t have as many injuries but secondly with the addition of Gut she #8217;s further down the pecking line and why would we prioritise her development over Gut. West Ham however have needed bodies. Honestly I #8217;m not too fussed over this I #8217;d prefer we focus on retaining the academy players as we #8217;ve lost so many in recent years, either to other clubs (Kelly, James etc) or players going to college in the US. Which honestly who can blame them. Also as well as it being a short term contract it #8217;s  #8220;non-contract terms #8221; presumably this is because signing a professional contract messes with her college eligibility.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Yes, quite a few people do actually, BT wouldn #8217;t pick it up if it didn #8217;t make a good business decision. It #8217;s not virtue signalling because other broadcasters like Sky or ITV decided it wasn #8217;t for them and no one judges negatively. Honestly I #8217;d recommend you try it, Man Utd have an exciting team and a great young manager. If it #8217;s not to your liking that #8217;s alright but you may be surprised if you give it a fair chance.

    <TEXT>I mean I can #8217;t say I agree with that being the same level but it #8217;s also fair to say that the technical level can be lower. I always have described the experience of women #8217;s football in the same vain as the traditional tactical, technical and physical differences between men #8217;s leagues. By this I mean (and historically more so as the differences aren #8217;t quite so profound nowadays) but watching Serie A was always a different experience than the Bundesliga or La Liga or the Premier League etc. For me that #8217;s how I viewed women #8217;s football. The good news is with increased funding the standards are consistently improving. A great example is that goalkeeping has been, unfortunately, historically poor (with exceptions of course) now that teams are actually employing goalkeeping coaches the standard has improved massively and for the young goalkeepers that is evident even more so as they #8217;ve come through youth systems with that coaching available to them.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Haha, I share most of Tim #8217;s pieces because he #8217;s the most consistent with content but I felt this one would probably be very reassuring to some. As he said defensive signings aren #8217;t flashy, I think that #8217;s why there #8217;s already some comments (community shield commentary etc) about a two horse race but we #8217;re still very much in it. Something that #8217;s overlooked with our signing, outside of actually being great signings in areas we needed them, is that it does free up our attacking players too. While I #8217;d love a big American signing (while not a big name, personally I actually really wanted Sonnett) our business has been superb and wrapping it up early really helps with integration. The Heath and Press news broke a week (maybe 2) ago but hasn #8217;t been announced yet.</TEXT>

There #8217;s a clear top 3 and outside of that while there are better sides they are all competitive with each other (and the top 3 in a lot of cases). On the one hand it #8217;s surprising but on the other it was maybe the most viable option for her. As a Leeds fan no way would she play for Man Utd and then who #8217;s left.

    <TEXT>I don #8217;t actually. Especially not in instances where pay is directly related to revenue. However I believe that in this circumstance it is totally fair. First of all the base wage that these players are being paid is completely fair, if anything one could argue that the men are being paid too little but considering they have confirmed that they give this wage to charity I doubt negotiating higher pay is something they are inclined to do. I #8217;m not sure how the bonuses work, whether it #8217;s a scenario where if they win the euros (for example) they will each be given a share of x amount, or if it #8217;s a % of the prize money received by the FA for winning a competition. If it #8217;s the latter that seems entirely fair. If it #8217;s the former it would depend on the amount being given. Sure the women shouldn #8217;t get an enormous amount each when the prize money won #8217;t be enormous but we don #8217;t know how they decide the bonuses. The amount to be shared between the England squad for winning the 2018 WC was supposedly  #163;5million, well short of the  #163;29million the French FA received so one can assume it #8217;s based on a % of prize money. I don #8217;t know enough about finances in Tennis, nor do I know enough about darts at all to address that part of your comment however, your examples show that the women do less than the men. As far as I #8217;m aware women #8217;s football has the same rule set as men #8217;s football, so I #8217;m not sure of the relevance here.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>It #8217;s a little bit more complicated for the women #8217;s game as some national teams (England being one) have central contracts. Wherein a number of players are paid by the FA (or whoever is in charge) regardless of playing. Usually they are the regulars of the national team. The men do not have this. Now this equal pay is just the appearance fee (as it were) and competition bonus. So like they earn x amount for a win/loss/draw and then if they won the World Cup they #8217;d get x amount and that is the same amounts as the male players.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>[Edit] They just said in comms she had a surgery on her appendix in preseason so she #8217;s behind the others in match fitness. ~~She did have an eye injury in preseason so that may have affected her preparation~~ but we are still only on the first match week and even though she didn #8217;t start the Community Shield I don #8217;t think it #8217;s indicative (yet) of her being the benched player. England and Kerr together was a great partnership so I #8217;m sure we #8217;ll see it again. Personally I think Harder won #8217;t be playing as a striker so we should see her + one of Kerr/England- or maybe all 3 if we do get that partnership back!</TEXT>

    <TEXT>It was a mixed bag for her. I think she pressed really well outside of the two goals and for the goals it was, like you said, more on Villa but she still contributed to them. Her shooting was very bad and how she didn #8217;t get a hat trick is beyond me. I #8217;m not a fan of playing her as the striker and that #8217;s exactly why. I #8217;m curious if there #8217;s another forward you #8217;d put in instead, if there were 4 midfield slots available she #8217;d be the person I #8217;d take out.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I'd also like to know the numbers they get on the red button, recordings (can't remember the term) and Iplayer for this show. I don't know the demographic but I can bet it's younger than traditional shows like MOTD and I can only speak for myself but the live show on BBC 1 isn't my preferred method of viewing. Using the makeup they already have if they put championship highlights etc into the online/red button version it could be a great way to gauge interest without affecting BBC 1. At least the Spurs/Arsenal FA Cup match will be on BBC2!</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I think it #8217;s a bit of an unfair thing to say. Sure that certainly played a huge part, and you could say more so for Harder to Chelsea. Players moving to be with their partners has or will probably benefit most teams in the league, but Bronze returning to City has been in play since she left. They essentially left the spot open for her, they were playing with strikers at RB last season instead of signing someone (or using Fidalgo...). If you #8217;re one of the best players in the world and in your position when going to England of course you #8217;d go to the top 3 clubs, the money the can offer coupled with the facilities they offer and team you can play with is beyond the other clubs added to that (now more so) the opportunity to play in the Champions League. It sucks for the league but at the same time the top 3 clubs shouldn #8217;t be unable to strengthen for champions league. It #8217;s a balance that I don #8217;t think there #8217;s a solution to, maybe the new homegrown rules will help but probably not. The broadcast issue is annoying but something that is also an issue in the men #8217;s game so sadly I don #8217;t think that #8217;ll be sorted either, the positive we have is that we can watch all of the top flight games, hopefully they will expand to championship games.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>She has one of, if not the largest profile in women #8217;s football hence I #8217;d agree in terms of brand recognition. On the field, certainly at club level, she #8217;s not anywhere near the level she once was. In 2019 she played 6 games and had 0 goals or assists. In 2018 she played 19 games and had 5 goals, 2 assists. In the 2019 WWC she played 6 games and had 6 goals and 3 assists. That seems great but 5 of the goals and all 3 assists came in the game against a much weaker Thailand. I #8217;m not a fan of comparing men #8217;s and women #8217;s players but I #8217;d hardly compare that to Messi. I am super excited and I sincerely hope she lights it up in the WSL.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I do wonder how much the crowd have played a part in the card situation this game. West Ham have obviously set out to play physically against Arsenal because that #8217;s how you hurt us but that intent added with the crowd hyping the players and adding pressure to the ref seems like a fire that #8217;s gone out of control.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Completely agree and the marketing boost vs disrupting the squad doesn #8217;t seem worth the balance to me. Because let #8217;s be real if we signed a player for PR reasons they #8217;d have to play, no one is sticking around because the player they follow is sitting riding bench. Disagree with OP that Lavelle would #8217;ve been perfect because, and don #8217;t get me wrong she #8217;s an amazing player (when fit), we #8217;re stacked in that position. A backup defender or backup striker would maybe be the only options but then that runs into the bench issue. Plus we already had our USWNT player with HAO!</TEXT>

For example Marta still being in player of the year discussions (or even winning). But either way I agree it has a harmful effect. I was talking to a Spurs fan about them signing Morgan and they compared it to signing Messi. I agreed in a brand sense but not on output and the fan said isn #8217;t she one of the best women #8217;s players. That #8217;s what things like this do, no doubt she is a great player, no doubt she once could #8217;ve listed this high but nowadays?.. As much as I hate to say it I hope she does amazing in the WSL because it will really help the league grow but the expectations that non-woso fans have because of things like this could turn them off completely when they aren #8217;t met.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Ludlow would be ideal for me but the (understandable) position of the Welsh FA makes that highly unlikely. I don #8217;t particularly want Kerr (although probably better than Neville) but the same can probably be said for her. Then it #8217;s like who #8217;s possible... Him.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>She #8217;s been playing insanely well so it #8217;s disappointing. That being said it #8217;s now an interesting position as we haven #8217;t had this much depth in a long time so it makes what happens next very intriguing. Without a formation or structure change we would likely see Van de Donk coming in for Roord. With a structural change we could see Nobbs coming back to the centre and McCabe, Evans, Foord or Van de Donk going out wide. With a formation change who knows! The potential injury to Williamson also highly complicates things because she #8217;s played two very different roles in the two games. I do think we would #8217;ve seen changes anyway after the international break though.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>This should only affect games available in the UK, so there may be less shown on the FA Player in the UK but those games (like those on BT Sport now) will still be available on the FA Player or the respective broadcast network. It could have (and of course this is pure speculation) but the quality of the overseas (and all) streams may be better because with the current setup BT/BBC foot the broadcasting expenses but with the additional money/ more matches on TV (not the FA Player) better/more cameras etc could be a bonus.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Pretty much anyone who didn #8217;t get injured was a regular last season! It #8217;s all speculation to be honest. As far as I #8217;m aware she #8217;s fit but that doesn #8217;t mean she #8217;s 100% and they may be managing that. It could be that her performances in training aren #8217;t at the level they want and we now have that competition there so she #8217;s droppable. It #8217;s hard to say Roord (who was essentially the replacement) wasn #8217;t doing well enough to justify it. As I said it #8217;s all speculation but also it #8217;s been 2 games without her starting and one with so it #8217;s very likely nothing.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I hate the fact that the FA don #8217;t pickup league cup games until the latter stages. The ones they are showing are purely because the club itself has decided to show it so they can simulcast. Bearing in mind it should be the FA #8217;s responsibility I #8217;m also disappointed Chelsea aren #8217;t showing the game v Arsenal. They were usually very good about showing games that weren #8217;t shown elsewhere and I really don #8217;t understand why they #8217;d drop the ball on this game. It #8217;s a big one and I don #8217;t say that just because I #8217;m an Arsenal fan, but the past few fixtures they #8217;ve either smashed us or it #8217;s been a tight but great game to watch (and cry at after).</TEXT>

But the main burden should lie with the FA. It has to be said however that we #8217;ve been worse than Chelsea for showing games ourselves that we otherwise wouldn #8217;t be able to watch.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Yeah I think our squad size is a pit overplayed this season. We #8217;re not dramatically smaller than the other squads now, I wish we would get some more players in but a bigger issue has to be with why we get so many injuries. Right now most of our injuries are contact injuries and thus not much can be done but injuries have been an issue for a while and maybe having more rotation and substation should be looked into.</TEXT>

I want to get Jota but getting a through ball assist when I #8217;m losing every game at least 5-0 is impossible for me.

    <TEXT>Thought I saw Stenson with plaster in an Instagram story from last game. At least it #8217;s timed well with Williams coming back, hopefully they haven #8217;t rushed her although I doubt they #8217;d truly rush her unless Manu got injured.</TEXT>

WSL games will always be on one of [the FA Player](https://faplayer.thefa.com/home/womens-super-league), [ATA Football](https://www.atafootball.com/) or on NBC Sports. Over on r/FAWSL we always have a megathread [(10/18s)](https://www.reddit.com/r/FAWSL/comments/jctjnd/megathread_wsl_championship_matches_sunday_18th/) of where to watch the games if you are unsure, made by one of the lovely mods you have here.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I like Matt Beard and I #8217;m not usually one for sacking managers willy nilly but it #8217;s been clear for a while that West Ham need something/someone new. They can #8217;t defend and there seems to be a disconnect across the pitch. They #8217;d be in much bigger trouble if they had less backing but with more teams backing women #8217;s sides they can #8217;t rely on that for much longer.</TEXT>
