    <TITLE>Disconnecting right before alert ends - *TILT* PLZ fix this DBG</TITLE>
    <DATE>2018-08-10 20:56:35</DATE>
    <TEXT>Seriously though, it cannot be that hard to add a function that awards the character with the most activity in a specific alert the respective rewards (whether offline or online). It obviously already tracks activity as rewards scale, so um...why is this not a thing? It's really no fun to spend 1h29 minutes of dedicated effort to win a continent lock, get a d/c crash at the wrong moment and get absolutely nothing at all. Exceedingly frustrating and demotivating.</TEXT>

    <TITLE>Flash decloaking issue since patch</TITLE>
    <DATE>2018-08-28 17:35:41</DATE>
    <TEXT>I play quite a bit of Flash, and since the latest patch/hotfixes there is a new issue with de-cloaking on a Wraith. Using both the Renegade and the Starfall, every other pull the primary fire command will simply not respond for several seconds after de-cloaking. At first i thought DBG had stealth-nerfed Wraith Flashes, but it only happens every other time, it will however kill you, since that delay is enough to let anyone react. This is with "Decloak on fire" OFF, and was never happening before the latest updates. edit: actually i have to say it's getting worse. Right now it's happening almost constantly, making pulling a Flash almost pointless. I've lost count of the number of the times the fire command simply won't respond for ages now. edit2: this is also 100% NOT a server or connectivity issue. Anyone can test it right now, i've pulled flashes in VR and just in empty hexes on continents, the same issue pops randomly ever other decloak. It sometimes takes up to 3(!) seconds for the fire prompt to react at all.</TEXT>

    <TITLE>So let's talk about this Flash nerf.</TITLE>
    <DATE>2018-10-11 19:40:12</DATE>
    <TEXT>Initially I didn't think it would be a big deal. I play a lot of Wraith Flash, I think it's a very fun and engaging playstyle for solo players, and was approaching my last Auraxium on it. However, after this patch the Wraith has become pretty much unusable for anything, really. Here's the thing: the 5s delay on decloaking, that's fine. It's a bit of a nerf to chaining tank kills etc, but not really, since you're usually decloaked for a few seconds anyway, and frankly in most situations either you kill the target or the target kills you. You're in a freaking Flash after all, literally anything instagibs it. What utterly kills Wraith Flashes now is the added 25% energy cost to activate the cloak - at ANY point. Even with maxed Wraith cloak, this means that pretty much anytime that it takes you longer than 10 seconds or so to stealth to the position that you want to reach, you're basically without a cloak as soon as you de-cloak because you just can't afford to re-cloak even after the 5 seconds have passed. Oh, and fat-fingering your cloak pretty much kills your pull anyway, so GG. I'm very puzzled by this change, and disheartened tbh. Starfall caused too much salt, fine, nerf it, whatever. But why did the Flash need to be killed overall? Fury/Renegade/Kobalt Flashes have been a thing for years and years, and never was it considered an issue or something that was killing the game for new players. Essentially you can now try and get 1 kill or maybe a handful of infantry kills on a Wraith before you inevitably get oneshot. Can I just have my certs for all the mounted weapons and the Wraith Cloak back then, please? Because it's become utterly pointless now. What is the philosophy behind this? "We must nerf anything that might be detrimental to the new player experience"? Is that it? If that's the case, how about we start with an actually useful tutorial and better UI/ingame guidance for players? Why do "farm tools" have to be nerfed to protect bad or inexperienced players? Good tankers/infantry players will always hear/see a Wraith Flash, they will kill the Flash at least 50% of the time before any damage can be done. That was the case BEFORE this change. Now Flashes are basically Certs being driven to the enemy. **I suggest taking back the 25% activation cost, it's the real culprit here. The 5s delay is fine, it makes you a little more vulnerable and gives the not-so aware players more time to react to an ambush or to get revenge on a fleeing Flash. The activation cost is unneeded, overly harsh, and pretty much kills the playstyle entirely.**  #8203; Mardevian, VS, Miller btw  #8203;</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Hey, what a surprise, a PS2 patch that causes new issues. Today: played for about an hour, then randomly spiked to 15k ping with everything happening at 5 second delays. Exited game, restarted - hey wouldn't you know it, i know cannot log in to the game at all anymore and get almost instantly disconnected upond loading up a character. Oh and it's not \*my\* connection, tested at 60/15 mb and 5-10 ms to regional infrastructure at the same time as attempting to log in. What gives, devs? This year has been probably the worst I can personally remember, it's been practically unplayable half the time due to god-awful performance (whether it's the servers or the "bad code", I really don't care anymore, it's been going on forever). Now I can't even log on anymore. I don't give a flying fuck about content updates or skins or bundles. How can this game run like so shit for so many different clients, and have new and returning gamebreaking or performance-affecting issues EVERY - SINGLE - PATCH. I'm so goddamn DONE. Yeah I'm frustrated as hell.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Like many i binged through the manga up to the current chapter after watching the first episodes of the anime. Suffice it to say as a huge Rui shipper i'm emotionally crushed right now and can only hope this eventually leads to a happy ending. I've not read many romantic manga overall, can anyone recommend some good ones that have more or less satisfying pay-offs? They don't necessarily have to be corny happy endings, but I'm really desperate for some romance that makes \*sense\* and is a little more mature than teenagers hurting each other right now. Or just generally tips for good romance manga (genre mash-ups are fine, so is adult material). I recently binged \*Nozoki Ana\* which i very much enjoyed.</TEXT>

    <TITLE>Rui-ned or: why DomeKano is much more predictable and internally consistent than you may think</TITLE>
    <DATE>2019-02-15 19:00:39</DATE>
    <TEXT>DISCLAIMER:This post will contain multiple spoilers for DomeKano, obviously, but also "Good Ending", you have been warned! Like many of you I was a bit shell-shocked when the recent break-up happened. But then I realized pretty quickly that I #8217;d forgotten my basics of romantic narrative structure, and that all was happening exactly as it should.I won #8217;t bore you with too many details about the science of act structure and all that, but I #8217;ll use some pointers to illustrate why yes  #8211; **Rui is the focus of the story, and the inevitable endpoint.** So first off, any romance plot generally lives off three major stages: **the Meet, the Lose, and the Get**. In other words, you are introduced to the characters and the love interest first, you/the audience/the MC \*loses\* the love interest eventually, and finally reconciles and finds happiness in the end. Absence makes the heart grow fonder, no happiness without sadness, all those platitudes we know and love  #8211; they fully apply to writing a dramatic arc, and no romantic story would be truly gripping or compelling if there were no sense of loss and hurt involved. In terms of DomeKamo, the arc structure is pretty clear: Rui is introduced right at the start, and she and Nat are immediately intertwined in the **the Meet/Inciting Incident** *The inciting incident brings man and woman together and into conflict; an inventive but credible contrivance, often amusing, which in some way sets the tone for the action to come* Namely, them sleeping together. It immediately sets the stage for Rui to be the  #8220;trigger #8221; of the plot, the MC #8217;s and the audience #8217;s immediate focus, as well as to pose a certain enigma for Nat/the reader to gradually explore and unravel. Rui is then  #8211; much like in Sasuga #8217;s previous work, \**Good Ending*\*, a constant presence and developing character during Nat #8217;s initial pursuit and relationship with Hina. It should be noted that during this entire stage Rui gets much more character development than Hina  #8211; Nat #8217;s love interest at the time. She moves from being a tight-lipped enigma to a heart-pounding allure for Nat, all the while Hina never really moves from her role (more on Hina later). We eventually, pretty much at the 1/3 marker of the presumed rough running time of DomeKano (Sasuga Kei has stated that it won #8217;t exceed 30 volumes, we are currently in volume 21 or 22/3), reach **The Turning Point** *Traditionally occurring at the end of Act 1, a new development that raises story stakes and clearly defines the protagonist #8217;s goal; most successful when it sets man and woman at cross-purposes and/or their inner emotions at odds with the goal* Being the end of the Hina relationship, and the realization for both Nat and Rui that they have feelings for each other, along with the complicated situation that this entails. We arrive at **The Midpoint/Raising the Stakes** *A situation that irrevocably binds the protagonist with the antagonist (often while tweaking sexual tensions) and has further implications for the outcome of the relationship* very shortly after that with the Cultural Festival which makes the characters #8217; intentions for one another abundantly clear, and ties their fates together for the rest of the plot. We #8217;ve just gone through **Swivel: Second Turning Point** *Traditionally occurring at the end of Act 2, stakes reach their highest point as the romantic relationship #8217;s importance jeopardizes the protagonist #8217;s chance to succeed at his/her state goal #8212;or vice versa #8212;and his/her goal shifts* as the relationship has endangered their personal development and goals (Nat #8217;s writing, Rui #8217;s cooking career, each one of them needing to mature). And have closed off Act 2 with the ** #8220;Lose #8221;** moment, or **The Dark Moment/Crisis** in the break-up, *Wherein the consequences of the swivel decision yield disaster; generally, the humaliating scene where private motivations are revealed, and either the relationship and/or the protagonist #8217;s goal is seemingly lost forever* We are currently entering the **3rd Act,** wherein the characters will develop individually and ultimately find back together again for the **Joyful Defeat/Resolution** *A reconciliation that reaffirms the primal importance of the relationship; usually a happy ending that implies marriage or a serious commitment, often at the cost of some personal sacrifice to the protagonist*  #8203;  #8203; * #8220;But wait, what about Hina?? #8221;*  #8203; Well, I give Sasuga credit for creating a relatively large camp of followers for Hina, it shows that, although she frequently overuses tropes and deus ex machina devices to alter character relationships and dynamics, she made some smart decisions. The sister premise ( #8220;but not by blood! #8221;) is a good way to ensure that the main love rival (Hina) remains a constant presence, even when she isn #8217;t even part of the plot at the time. I know the argument has been made before that Hina has a  #8220;flat #8221; arc, and ergo might still be the endpoint. This, however, has no basis in the actual plot of DomeKano in my opinion. For one, Hina has received little to no character development. It #8217;s not just her arc that #8217;s flat, it #8217;s her entire character. When she is required to remind the reader of her importance and role as a rival, she is brought back with a plot device (psycho stalker) in a forced situation that is supposed to tease the reader as to Nat #8217;s feelings for her. Notably, Hina also never really moves forward with her obsession over Nat, or gains much perspective as to their situation, even to this point in the story. This is also rather typical of the main love rival character, in that the MC is freed of the burden to  #8220;also make the rival happy #8221; or solve her feelings for her  #8211; usually by having the rival find happiness in another character or event. In Hina #8217;s case, this might be finding back to teaching (which the story points out multiple times she was good at and happy with, yet is tied to her guilt over how she handled the Nat situation), or possibly a new relationship after getting over her romantic attachment to Nat. Hina is also strikingly similar to **MAJOR  #8220;GOOD ENDING #8221; SPOILERS HERE** Shou-senpai, the main love rival in Sasuga Kei #8217;s previous manga  #8220;Good Ending #8221;. She too was the MC #8217;s first love interest that he pursued, she too had a previous bad/scandalous relationship that haunted her, is older, she too developed strong, unflinching feelings for the MC that she never lost until she is finally back with her old previous relationship and happy again. Notably, the MC does nothing to cause this for her, and instead breaks her heart by being too emotionally invested in the \*actual\* romantic antagonist (Yuki). She similarly never developed her character from the initial introduction, and was damseled when required for the plot to have her come to the forefront and become a more apparent threat to the main couple (much like the psycho stalker angle with Hina). In stark contrast, Rui not only develops drastically over the First Act, but is also shown to grow and mature along with Nat in their relationship, along with all the woes and drama that entails. This is, in my humble opinion, a sure-fire indication of Hina not actually being the main romantic antagonist, which is Rui #8217;s role.  #8203;  #8203; * #8220;So what about other characters? #8221;*  #8203; To go back to  #8220;Good Ending #8221; comparisons, but also to many other typical romance-focused manga, the other characters don #8217;t stand a chance to actually be the ultimate conclusion of the story. None of them have the depth and development required to qualify in this story, and they have direct equivalents in  #8220;Good Ending #8221;. Serizawa can be pretty much directly be compared to Onuma in GE, a beautiful girl from a work/project environment that develops strong, pure feelings for the MC and tempts him repeatedly with innocent, direct approaches, and threatens the relationship to the main romantic antagonist (Yuki/Rui) in the process. The new character Misaki (scar girl) comes along at \*precisely\* the same point in time as Yuasa in GE  #8211; it is after the end of the 2nd act, the  #8220;Lose #8221; moment has gone by, and the MC seeks/finds solace with a blond (presumably) older, sexually more confident and aggressive woman. She will not be a romantic interest, but a guide/comfort.Chef-boi has also come along roughly at the time the male love rival is required, similar to Touru in Good Ending and really, most other typical romance stories.  #8203;  #8203; * #8220;But Nat blushed when x flashed her panties! He was thoughtful when Hina touched him! #8221;*  #8203; Sasuga has mixed the plot in DomeKano with more blatant harem tropes. IE constant slipping on banana peels to get panty shots and slipping bras, and Nat getting into trouble because of it. These are not to be taken as an indication of where the main plot will go. In fact, Nat #8217;s constant immaturity and passivity in the face of girls throwing themselves at him might even be a relevant point in the 3rd Act, something for him to mature out of and demonstrate.  #8203;  #8203; * #8220;Alright, smarty-pants, what #8217;ll happen then? #8221;*  #8203; Act 3 will probably be longer than most anticipate, likely up to another 100 chapters.We should see Nat heal and mature a bit with Misaki, be pursued by Serizawa and ultimately break her heart/send her on her way. Rui will do some healing of her own, and potentially engage in some teasing (of the audience) with Chefboi. Hina will confront Nat with her feelings once more, potentially, and overcome them/find acceptance within herself for the futility of the situation. The story went out of its way in the past to depict many times how Nat is  #8220;tempted #8221; by Hina in some way, and how he clearly (uncharacteristically so, even) remains steadfast and loyal to Rui. Ultimately, we will arrive at a final point of crisis where either Nat or Rui or both accept that they are simply destined for one another, and have a last hurdle to overcome before getting back together for good. This could be Nat or Rui or both being in a relationship that needs to be ended, Nat becoming a great writer and not knowing whether he can remain that if he gets back together with Rui, or potentially even Hina being flung in at the end again by having her confess again  #8211; that last part would probably be the weakest and most obviously dismissable threat to Nat/Rui, so I doubt it. Hina has already been set up as the former lover-turned ally ( #8220;I want to support him as best I can #8221;), and I can easily see Hina, realizing that Nat and Rui are hopelessly in love still, being the final trigger, actually giving Nat the push to win her back and find happiness. After all, Nat #8217;s happiness is more important to her than her own  #8211; an act for which she will be rewarded in the plot by finding back to teaching, a happy relationship, etc. Finally, it should be noted that, while it all seems to be going according to convention, and Sasuga Kei has not shown any inkling of drastically deviating from the formula, it #8217;s always entirely possible that she #8217;ll take a left turn out of nowhere just for the sake of it. I kind of doubt it though. For one, it #8217;s pretty atypical for the genre. Romance is best when it is largely predictable, ie when the reader gets what he/she was led to expect and want for the majority of the plot. Human characters that act entirely unpredictably and irrational tend to lead to a disconnect with the narrative and a break in immersion. There is a sense of satisfaction for the audience to get what they  #8220;felt #8221; and hoped was coming, and that #8217;s the entire point of the Three Act structure in romance. EDIT:artuno actually made me think of another pretty big hint.The title is "Domestic Girlfriend" - cooking is a pretty "domestic" activity.Rui can cook.Hina can't.Booooom. EDIT2: Addendum: Something that came to me today is that Chefboi is coming along precisely at the right moment to serve as part of the final dramatic climax, as the rival to overcome. Meanwhile, Hina has no such story set up. This to me is another very big indication that Rui is the dramatic focus for the climax of the plot. It is also \*another\* striking similarity to Good Ending: SPOILERS Wherein Yuki is separated by distance from the MC at the end, \*and\* has a love rival "threaten" her. Unfortunately in GE it meant that Yuki was being damseled for no apparent reason, in DomeKano i assume it will lead to a more mature entanglement with RuixNatxChefboi potentially in a triangle to figure out at the end. The fact that Rui has all these flags set up while Hina is basically stuck in emotional limbo is another strong indicator for the setup, in my opinion.  #8203;  #8203; *Well.*  #8203; That was longer than I expected. I may have forgotten some thoughts and points that occurred to me over the last few days, if I remember them I #8217;ll edit them in. If you #8217;re still here or actually read all of this, thanks for your time! Hopefully you got something out of it.Otherwise, join me for the final act and some more teases, possible love rivals and the ultimate sticky-sweet ending with lots of little Nat-Rui babies.  #8203; *Processing img fgmi15nz4sg21...*</TEXT>

After deciding against Hina and having their little confrontation (prior to the NY trip), after the story showing, effectively, no romantic interest of Nat's toward Hina (instead having him decide for Rui more than once). After all this, Nat is supposed to now propose his newly discovered/remembered romantic love for Hina after she wakes up \*FROM A COMA AFTER 5 YEARS\*, with Rui and his kid in play, while living together with Rui. All this in two chapters without any interaction from Hina so far, while keeping in mind that the ending should pretty much line up with the preview chapter we saw so long ago.

However, the effects and production value have aged \*horribly\*, and let's face it (this may be heresy to some), much of the casting was...suboptimal. Hollywood and the big streaming services churn out so much remake/prequel \*garbage\*, recently I heard they were even planning to remake Battlestar:Galactica (for Pete's sake it's not that old, it entirely holds up today). I know JMS has been lobbying around to try and get a movie or maybe a reboot done and has been struggling, in part because WB is sitting on the TV rights and unwilling to sell them.

I could *swear* that they actually kiss in that scene when we watched it, but whenever I go and rewatch the original English version, it doesn't happen. Was this just cut from the American broadcast? I'm fairly certain it did happen because I remember my mother actually remarking on how "oh, they're actually going there, good for them". I had a similar experience with the SyFy TV adaptation of DUNE, where there were lots of cuts of nudity in the American broadcast compared to the international broadcast we got in Europe.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Given the nature of how for example maps seem to be affected by Harvest-crafting (more of everything you want, see the Beachhead map example), as well as the "of Fortune" tag, I highly suspect the Harvest-crafted Goddess fragments will open an Uberlab that contains a divine font which either lets you target subgroups of enchants, or gives you way more uses of the font. We've been crying for a way to reduce the RNG of enchants for a while, given how bloated the number of possibilities for head enchants in particular has become. Thoughts?</TEXT>

    <TITLE>Escalation or Moderation? What will the PoE2 meta approach be?</TITLE>
    <DATE>2020-06-04 12:54:29</DATE>
    <TEXT>It seems to me (and Chris Wilson apparently confirmed this in the interview on Harvest now) that they are actively attempting to test and break the limits of the current systems at play in the game. Given that we have PoE2 coming along at some point, what do you think the philosophy behind this approach is? Is it, as Zizaran supposed in his reaction vid, a "let's get all the crazy stuff out there now before we return to a balanced state in PoE2" approach? Or will the game continue to retain the current complexity of choices and mechanic-abusing, if not build on it? To me, I think PoE2 will (and should) cull most league mechanics, and probably crack down on a lot of options currently available, to set a fresh slate with all the new ascendancies, skills and mechanics. It can then iterate from there with new leagues and additions again (and maybe attempt fresh takes on past league concepts that could do with a redo?). An example would be the escalating options to avoid selfcasting, which could do with basically a wipe and return to more, better designed and less clunky selfcasting options (in combination with new Ascendancies). I would add that I don't mean this in terms of one being good and the other bad, just in terms of how to approach the continuing design philosophy sensibly, allowing for the most room for iteration and variation.</TEXT>

That way you retain the risk/reward of the mods, but don't have to set up maps in particular to fish for higher tier seeds efficiently at a specific point, or have to do them while mapping, and can do it at your leisure later (like entering Incursion temple when you choose to with the rooms you set up, basically).</TEXT>

    <TITLE>Theory: Climax of Wano Arc, Big Mom's purpose</TITLE>
    <DATE>2020-06-12 08:45:39</DATE>
    <TEXT>For a while now I've been wondering what the purpose of Big Mom's ability could be as a tool for driving the narrative. I've come to believe that - going with the trend of Luffy "converting" anyone who isn't arch-evil (and Big Mom doesn't fit the bill in that respect for me), Big Mom will be "redeemed" at the climax of the arc. In fact, I believe her ability will be used to revive Luffy, or more precisely, grant him a life extension to complete his journey. A loose idea of the events to come: Supernovas will eventually team up against Kaido/Big Mom, SH Fleet as well as Marines will get involved, Blackbeard will show up towards the end and basically kill Kaido/steal his fruit, after or before fighting Luffy and practically killing him as well while Big Mom looks on/remains neutral or is unable to interfere. Big Mom will come to realize that BB is the real threat to the Pirate Age (Age of Freedom), and revive Luffy with her ability, as he proved to be the only one around to stand a chance against BB's combined abilities despite falling short. He will be granted a life extension, let's say a year or a few years, to make it to Laugh Tale and defeat BB/the World Gov/Imu-Sama. There is of course Law's ability as well, but i do not believe Luffy will become immortal, I think the story will end with Luffy either having died and the world carrying on his spirit, or sailing off to explore for the remainder of his lifespan.</TEXT>

    <TITLE>Surveying the Rui-ns: Why the ending to Domekano was entirely*un*predictable</TITLE>
    <DATE>2020-06-12 12:59:09</DATE>
    <TEXT>Hello all, it's been a while. Maybe some of you recall me writing up a pretty popular theory thread shortly after Chapter 216 about how I perceived this manga to be structured, and what deductions were to be made based on that assumption. I debated for a while whether it was even worth the effort to go back and address how all this turned out, because frankly, it doesn't seem like the author herself put all that much effort into thinking all this through in the first place. But then I decided it was worth the energy to finish off the experience and time invested over the years into following this manga. **Disclaimer** Now, first, a huge disclaimer: some of you may know me from that other medium, where I have enjoyed trolling and teasing Oranges for a long time. Time for me to eat crow! Enjoy the win, and all the memes are well-deserved. However, I will now go into why I believe none of this was predictable, made sense, or is generally satisfying to the attentive reader, no matter what ship one sailed on. SECOND DISCLAIMER: It's a romance manga aimed at teens. While I enjoy breaking this stuff down at the level of dramatic analysis, the fact of the matter is that not even the author herself probably cares that much (not because of the ending, because of the nature of the medium) about the internal consistency of her work. **The story since 216** A short summary of the plot since 216 could be broken down as follows: Nat continues to work through and over his relationship with Rui, through a break-up, into a reunion, even leading to a child for the two of them. Throughout the course of this, we are treated to numerous ex machina side stories, "threats" to Hina or side characters, and Hina generally continuing to harbour feelings for Nat. Multiple characters either suggest or flat out tell Hina to basically get over it and move on with her life, because her feelings aren't healthy. In the final chapters, notably after Nat decided for Rui AGAIN and Rui gets pregnant, Hina suddenly falls into a coma saving Rui and hey presto! a few chapters later suddenly the entirety of the Rui relationship is laid to rest in favour of Nat proposing to a comatose Hina. **The cardinal sins** Sasuga committed one of the greatest storytelling sins possible in any medium: "SHOW, DON'T TELL". While some Oranges will vehemently insist that Nat had these feelings all along, they were just "hidden", it is a fundamental weakness of any form of storytelling to have to tell your audience what a character is doing, rather than it happening organically. You need look no further for evidence of this than to the fact that even many Hina-shippers are completely flabberghasted at the route Sasuga decided to take to reach this point. The entirety of the structure of the narrative, as well as the focus of romantic development, was focused on the Rui arc. Hina was forced into the picture repeatedly with ex machina devices to keep her "in the mind", but never maneuvered into actual development with Nat. While she was certainly teased to be in the picture, she was never depicted to have any kind of actual romantic evolution with Nat, quite opposite to Rui, with whom one could say Nat led a relatively "realistic" romance, for manga standards. **Fate versus Reality, and Western versus Japanese teen romance** In a way, Sasuga decided to take the cheap way out of resolving anything. In Western romance, even in that targeted at younger audiences, the concept of "fate" is not given nearly as much weight as life and relationship experience. To put it bluntly, romance, while implementing plenty of kitsch and dramatization, usually relies on the relatibility of the characters' interactions and reactions to convey a satisfying romantic end. Not so in Japanese teen romances, at least plenty of times. Japanese teenagers are very much into the concept of fate and the "one true love", even if this concept flies in the face of not just their own reality (a majority of young Japanese prioritize career over romance, and over 50% of students are self-proclaimed virgins), but even in the face of the narrative being presented, when judged against comparisons to a similar situation in reality. In essence, Sasuga constructed a relatively straight-forward meet-love-loss-reunion arc around Rui, only to interject the "fate" theme at the very last minute, leading to predictable bewilderment and amusement especially among her Western audience. **Real Life versus Teenage Angst** It is a predictable human sentiment to imagine and hope for an ideal, fated partner who unconditionally loves through thick and thin. It stems from our feelings of loss of security when growing up and realizing our parent guardians are but humans themselves, and seeking the comfort of unconditional love in the arms of a romantic partner, similar to how we tend to seek for answers in a parent "god" in religion. However, life doesn't work that way in reality, as we all know. Love certainly exists, but relationships are projects, compromises and most of all learning experiences. The teenage notion of ending the narrative at the point of "meet, love" without all the nasty and hurtful bits of "loss" and the process required to reach "reunion" is entirely bypassed by the route Sasuga decided to take to place Nat with Hina. In this sense, it #8217;s also highly questionable what kind of message Sasuga is trying to send to younger readers with this ending.  #8222;Keep dreaming, your prince/princess will eventually save you without you ever having to grow or change #8220;. It #8217;s a cute, but infantile notion that most readers with life experience will struggle to find relatable or enjoyable. **Parenthood** My final take on the relatability of the events presented: as a father myself, I find the notion of choosing to have a child with the woman you love, yet to then turn around and abandon that relationship for an exciting fling from one's past to probably be the most egregious misstep in the narrative. Patchwork families exist, sure, but the way it was depicted in Domekano just makes a mockery of anything an adult could take seriously. But then again, like I said, it is aimed at lonely teenagers and not at adults. **Why Hina Could Have Been Fine** Finally, I want to take a look at how Hina could have actually made sense and been somewhat satisfying as a conclusion. Because the essential parts were certainly set up - after 216, Rui was gone, Nat was broken and Hina hovering to enter the picture. The elements for a rekindling of their former feelings and a much more relatable, realistic triangle were all there. If Sasuga had continued with the rough structure she had set up pre-216, we could have witnessed a truly nailbiting finale, with a well-constructed Hina revival squaring off against a returning Rui. It would have also led to some more pain, because really, no triangle in real life ends without some broken hearts and tears. In that scenario, I would have been entirely ok with a Hina conclusion, if Hina had been given development with Nat, been shown to take charge of her feelings and act on them, and for Nat to actually be forced into a conflict he cannot avoid. Most notably, the pregnancy should have been left out in this scenario to make for a more even playing field. **Conclusion** It was a fun ride, even if what Sasuga decided to do with the opportunities she had set up in 216 ended up being a smoldering trash heap. I feel mostly sorry for Hina fans, who were truly robbed of a more engaging and satisfying narrative. Twists for the sake of twists unfortunately can never be predicted, and are never as rewarding as thinking a narrative through from start to finish. Now, to lean back and wait for the inevitable posts of "but Nat kept blushing while remembering Hina" that are supposed to be evidence of an existing narrative arc to their relationship ;) It's been fun, see you for the next Sasuga memefest!</TEXT>

    <TITLE>Some concrete suggestions to improve Harvest league mechanics</TITLE>
    <DATE>2020-06-25 08:28:50</DATE>
    <TEXT>There are currently countless threads voicing frustration with the way Harvest plays out in endgame, I thought I might compile a few of the key issues and gather some of the solutions I've seen as well as add some of my own: Issues: - too few T1 seed drops - higher Tier seeds require too much setup and time/seed investment to consistently and satisfyingly attain - some higher Tier seed rewards seem underwhelming for the investment - too little map interaction/density Some suggestions (many of these have been posted before): - add Harvest mob spawns to the cache similar to strongboxes. Heck, why not even give the cache modifiable affixes like strongboxes to boot. - additionally, let Harvest mobs guarding caches also have a chance to drop higher Tier seeds (the higher the map Tier, the higher the chance perhaps=) - have caches drop *more* T1 seeds - increase the frequency of getting crafting options, ie either by increasing T1 drops or lowering the cost of crafting options - shuffle some Harvest crafting options around on the Tiers (for example, targeted annuls/exalts on T1 are insane, but getting "exchange a few orbs for other orbs" on T2 feels bad for the investment) - easier access to higher Tier crafts: I would suggest simplifying the growing conditions for Tiers as follows: +*T2 seeds only require adjacency, no condensed lifeforce to grow* +*T3 only require 1 type of lifeforce dispensed* +*T4 seeds being the only seeds that require both adjacency AND both other types of lifeforce contributing* - reduce the number of red maps you have to run for T4 seeds - allow players the option to directly turn seeds into juice, thereby enabling us to target-plant craft options, and speeding up the dispensation of lifeforce for higher Tiers, which already require more cycles as it is - let Dispensers dispense multiple types of lifeforce, simplifying layout requirements - higher-scaling storage containers for more lifeforce investment, or which require higher Tier seed lifeforce to craft, to avoid having to spam storage These are some ideads that i've seen flying around, and some of my own. Feel free to contribute your own suggestions, or critique some of the ones i've made! Obviously, implementing *all* of these would likely inflate the more powerful options, so just a few of these or other solutions would probably suffice to make Harvest mapping experience more engaging and rewarding.</TEXT>

    <TITLE>A rambling attempt at fitting the puzzle pieces together</TITLE>
    <DATE>2020-07-21 13:57:47</DATE>
    <TEXT>So i've been through my first complete re-read of the entire manga, and i've been trying to come up with a more cohesive theory as to how everything fits together for the endgame. I don't think i've gotten any further than most, but let me start by just lining up all the pieces visually so far: WARNING! This will likely be extremely long, convoluted, and contain lots of SPOILERS for those not uptodate yet. Things we *know* (can skip over this if you like): - at one point there was a vast and powerful kingdom which essentially guided or governed the world. This kingdom has decendants (D.) still alive today, who by and large seem to be individuals blessed with unusually strong powers either of will or body or both. This kingdom also very likely held the secret to the nature of devil fruits and/or the ancient weapons. - multiple smaller kingdoms rebelled/conspired (the latter being more likely here) to overthrow this Line of D., highly likely motivated by power/personal gain. After this overthrow they established their new seat of power atop the Red Line, where nearly all families that made up these kingdoms moved (Nefertari being the exception). - poneglyphs were set up by the Kozuki line of Wano (who did not become part of this new World Government), documenting the events that took place, and probably a prophecy. A member of the later Kozuki line jumped 800 years into the future with her devil fruit power, likely to fulfil the circumstances of this prophecy (implying someone traveled into the past to inform the Line of D. / Kozukis of these events in the future, but more on that later) - *at least* one crew of pirates (Gol D. Roger) has since found the One Piece by reading the *Laugh Tale* - more on what "One Piece" and why it's possibly called "Laugh Tale" later - this crew then did not act on the information to topple the WG or bring about great change - it was not the "right" time yet, as we have heard multiple times now from various characters, and there is an appointed person/time to come (obviously Luffy) Other individuals learned about Laugh Tale (Whitebeard) but chose not to act because they did not seemingly care all that much (his motivations were not for global change, but to have his own family) - the WG is being led by a shadowy figure named Imu-sama, who seems to have knowledge of the past (obviously), but potentially also of the future (preparing for certain events) - giants play a key role in the machinations of the WG and multiple other individuals in the world. They are alluded to as "continent movers" (Oars Sr.) and gigantic, shadowy figures even show up in the Florian Triangle (who seemingly aren't reflections like the Shandians earlier) - there are other worlds beside the world the story takes place on, including aliens, and there are alien pirates (with strangely elongated heads, more on that later) - there are two primary antagonists to the StrawHats: the World Government, and the Blackbeard Pirates, with differing motivations. The WG is interested in maintaining its power and interests, while Blackbeard is interested in becoming the most infamous and powerful pirate/individual in general. Both he and Luffy share roughly similar ambitions and a comparable willpower, but have drastically different notions of morality, and very different ideas of what fame and power mean (for Luffy, "power" is simply the ability to be as free as possible and to defend those dear to one). That's enough summary of what's already established, now on to some rambling as to the possible nature/point of several key plot elements and how everything fits together: *The Nature of the Laugh Tale, Joy Boy, and the Void Century* The one takeaway we've gotten so far from the final poneglyph is that it made all of Roger's crew *laugh*. Not only is this a hilarious twist on the katakana reading of "Raftel" that Oda left us intentionally in the dark on for over twenty years, it also has several striking implications. This has been discussed and postulated before (on this very sub, it's not my original idea) but a reason as to why it made them all laugh could be a) the style of the writing b) the content being so hilarious in context of their situation, and in light of the world's situation. One possible conclusion is that it, in a very amusing way, describes pretty exactly what will happen in the Great War to come, and that those events are already set in place ergo unchangable, because it is a time loop. One or more characters (possibly the entire SH crew) will travel to the past *after* the final conflict, in order to pass on the tale. Given how Luffy makes *everyone* he encounters laugh, it seems quite likely that it might just be him. If he writes the tale the way he usually talks, it makes sense as to why it would amuse Roger's crew especially, who hold very similar values. Another little tidbit: ever wondered why so many characters have weird, particular laughs in One Piece? Because it *IS* the "Laugh Tale", as told by Luffy and/or his nakama, including colourful descriptions of the various laughs he encountered. So what about Imu-sama and the significance of the Strawhat? I believe there are only two possible explanations for the nature of Imu: he/she is either a character who was around during the Void Century, possibly even of the line of D. himself, and who knows *part* of the picture of what is to come. Or he is actually an alien pirate, either a descendant of a long line dating back to the void century, or a particularly long-lived/immortal species (his weirdly elongated hood might fit the oddly elongated heads of the space pirates we see in Enel's cover panels). Strawhats were something all people who encountered the SH crew in the past grew fond of (much like they leave behind enthusiastic practices and customs everywhere they go with kids emulating them), and the particular one in Mary Geoise is a preserved one that a *giant* wore (we #8217;ve seen this echoed by Ace giving Oars Jr. a straw hat  #8211; everything in One Piece goes in cycles/repetition, for good reason). The strawhat is associated by Imu with the Line of D. and the prophecy of the downfall of his/her domain as foretold by the very individual who already made it happen in the past. Not certain about the details or how to prevent it exactly, Imu brings about the very chain of events which eventually cycles back to the same end result. If Oden #8217;s wife, who had the power of the time travel fruit, died, the fruit would reappear and someone else might  #8222;awaken #8220; the power to send Luffy/the SH back in time. However she may also simply be alive and have jumped even further into the future, likely following instructions she had obtained 800 years previously. Shanks (who I believe is either a D., since we *never* got his full name, or someone whose family passed down the knowledge) passed the SH on to Luffy, "betting" that it might be him the poneglyph talked about - potentially the poneglyph even talked about JoyBoy wearing the SH, which i'm sure startled Roger and his crew. While Shanks has not been to Laugh Tale yet (that we know of), it seems clear that some information, at the very least, was passed on to him. JoyBoy/Luffy had promised Shirahoshi that he would take her to see forests, unfortunately he won't make it since he has to travel back in time, ergo he apologizes for breaking his promise. He attempts to lift Noah too soon, in the past, to avoid the destruction of Fishman Island in the future, which did take place in the final conflict. But it cannot be done at that point. *Giants, The Red Line and Big Mom* Giants play a huge (no pun intended) role in the ongoing canon. Not only is the WG keenly interested in them, Elbaf has also been set up as one of the islands if not the final stop on the Straw Hats #8216; journey toward Laugh Tale. It is highly likely that it is the location of the final road poneglyph. Now why would the WG be so interested in giants? The fact that the Tenryuubito moved to Mary Geoise (as it seems to play on  #8222;geology #8220; and  #8222;geodes #8220; as well as  #8222;mare #8220; in Italien, I would imagine it was named something close to  #8222;Sea of Stone #8220;) only *after* forming the WG and the fact that Oars was nicknamed a "continent mover", as well as the shadowy HUGE figures in the Florian Triangle lead me to believe, that: The world used to be a far more free, openly traversible ocean. The WG actually used Oars-type giants to *create* the Red Line in slave labour, to restrict movement and freedom in the world and to more easily control divided, isolated islands. At some point, either the WG at the time killed off most of the larger giants, or lost them for some other reason. The shadowy figures in the Florian Triangle were either: a) the result of Vegapunk's experiments or b) similar giants to Oars who were attracted to his noise. The WG is now keenly interested in giants again because they have the technology to effectively control them now (see Kuma), and they are likely their "secret weapon" over which they abandoned the Shichibukai system. My theory is that these will show up in Wano towards the end, and be the catalyst for both Big Mom's and Elbaf's tale. Big Mom is a highly interesting character who is critical to the plot in more ways than one. She's implied to not be arch-evil, even to have multiple personalities. Her core "dream" is a good one. Her DF ability is also highly interesting, as if she can *take* life, I suspect she can *give* it as well. I believe these circumstances will lead to two things: a) Big Mom *will* eventually side with the StrawHats, for her own reasons (and I believe it will be encountering either Blackbeard or WG-controlled mecha-giants or both, and Luffy aiding her). b) She will save Luffy's life after he essentially dies. I also believe that Big Mom #8217;s soul has been  #8222;corrupted #8220; by ingesting so many evil souls, such as Carmel #8217;s, and they live on inside her. This the reason for her conflicting personalities, and she will eventually be reduced to her original, benign core (like after she gets amnesia). In contrast, Kaido is a fairly onedimensional character (with very little backstory to boot). It seems clear that one of these two has a key role to play going forward, and the other probably not so much. Clearly, Kaido will get more fluff to him before he is done, but I still maintain that Big Mom is far more critical to the plot. Right, there was more i #8217;m thinking about, and some of this is just a writeup of other theories i #8217;ve seen (all credit to the original creators, kudos!) as well as some of my own musings. Apologies for the very long ramble, but I need to put it all down in writing, and to get some input from others! Are there any points that are already clearly impossible due to something I missed? EDIT: something that *just* occurred to me while writing: what if Luffy is actually the ancestor of Gol D. Roger? If this is actually a time loop, which we have a few hints for now, this would explain why he seems so similar to Roger and strikes so many of Roger's affiliates as his spiritual successor. ..Actually i'm almost certain this is the case now, it would explain why Roger had a straw hat as well and looks like the spitting image of Luffy in his flashback panel with Rayleigh</TEXT>

    <TITLE>An honest question about the focus of development</TITLE>
    <DATE>2020-07-22 08:47:45</DATE>
    <TEXT>I've been following this project from the sidelines for a very long time now. The one thing that sticks out like a sore thumb for me is something i'm not sure i'm correct about. I'm no game dev, I have 0 experience in any arena related to game development. But what strikes me as fantastically odd is that CIG has spent a *decade* on developing engine fine-tuning, creating tons of ship models, and planets. In short, *assets*, instead of *systems*. In my mind, wouldn't the highest priority to releasing a functioning, playable product be the *systems* aspect? As in, functioning gameplay loops, reward schemes, bug-fixing so gameplay actually runs smooth. They're not designing an engine from scratch after all, never were afaik. They've had the tools for more graphical assets for many years, yet I see barely any progress on the gameplay front. It all just looks like tech demos, and *now* we get a release on the state of AI? How come other companies can churn out functioning games (with rather complex mechanics and system interactions) in a fraction of the time? Why aren't more people asking these questions among the backers? I grew wary early on as their goalposts kept moving and more and more aspects kept getting added, feature bloat and sidetracking galore. But now it's been a solid few years of no major new features and it still feels like it's going *nowhere*. Somebody tell me i'm wrong, I don't know enough about game development, and the scope of their project is just so large that it's warranted. Please, I'd rather that be true.</TEXT>

    <DATE>2020-07-24 09:54:35</DATE>
    <TEXT>I wrote a bit of a meandering, long theory thread a few days ago. However, one point struck me as I was writing, and deserves its own place: Based on the theory that Luffy/SH Crew themselves travel to the past later and are the ones who wrote the "Laugh Tale", ie. Joy Boy = Luffy, it strikes me as the most obvious explanation for *why* Luffy is so similar to Roger in so many ways. Throughout the story, countless characters reference how Luffy strikes them as the spiritual successor of Roger. In fact, we even see a young Roger - *wearing the Straw Hat* - look stunningly like Luffy in the panel of him meeting Rayleigh. *What if* Luffy is actually Roger's ancestor in the past - therefore also Ace's - and the Straw Hat got passed down the family line. This would also line up with why Imu-sama has a straw hat preserved in Mary Geoise, and is keeping an eye out for those associated with this symbol.</TEXT>

    <DATE>2020-07-28 07:41:31</DATE>
    <TEXT>I've been wracking my brain trying to figure out why Moria is kept around in the story. He gets his own little side story at Marineford, Perona is kept around, Absalom and then we get to BB's island. Did the BBs actually target Absalom to lure Moria specifically? I have a suspicion: namely, that BB is after Kaido's DF, and he wants to use Moria to get to it somehow. Clearly, Moria lost to Kaido before and would hold a grudge. Perona also zoomed off in search of Moria after learning of his survival, so she should show up again. I'm struggling to think of a way for Moria to be instrumental at the end of Wano, but I think that's where it's been leading with his connection to Kaido and now his open-ended fate at BB's island. Anyone got some ideas?</TEXT>

    <TEXT>If they were promised a physical item and failed to receive it, it would be up to a judge to determine whether it is appropriate to demand a refund *for this item specifically* after such a long time period has elapsed. This all goes into whether a transaction was completed in good faith. If a customer randomly decides years later to voice a complaint, it can be deemed unreasonable to expect the vendor/company to still have the ability to fulfill the transaction's conditions. I suspect in this case the best case scenario would be a court deeming that CIG would have to refund the price of the objects not delivered as per the agreement, especially if they can't present any documentation of commission for delivery or any other excuse. *However* that is clearly a separate issue to the digital content purchased and received, conflating the two would seem disingenuous.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>We've known that Wano is the big penultimate arc before the finale for a long time now. Big things will be happening that set the stage for the final conflict, we've been told as much by Goda himself multiple times. That being said it's still going to be years and hundreds of chapters. I'm going to wager a guesstimate and go for roughly 250 chapters to completely finish, on the conservative side. Although I think Wano is going to spill over into other locations fairly soon-ish.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I'm on the fence, personally. It has a lot of promise, and combines many of the best aspects from previous MMOs. It's also trying to tread new ground in areas other games have previously fallen short in. However i'm unsure whether the permanent PvP-nature of the world, as well as the decidedly Asian-style itemization (break down trash loot, upgrade items with gems and raid loot etc) appeal to me really. I will definitely give it a try when it does arrive, and see how it actually feels on live. Bonus points if it lets me make a class similar to my favourite ever, the Herald of Xotli (cloth-wearing, 2handed sword-wielding battlemage using fire spells and demonic arts in melee, from Age of Conan).</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Remember that this is a Marineford-type situation. There will be so many players, and so much going on, that offscreen defeats and deaths can certainly be a thing, or offhanded quick ones like Orochi's. We're not going to get half chapter duels for most involved. So it is entirely possible that those two got eliminated really quickly to set the stage for *real* threat. However, I doubt it. Orochi especially deserves a better pay-off than that.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>One aspect seems to directly contradict this theory: the fact that the line of D. is directly identified as the line of descendants of that Ancient Kingdom by multiple sources. I do agree that Joyboy was not the King or Leader of the AK. Mostly because i'm ever more confident that Joyboy was actually Luffy himself and we're getting a time loop at the end. But even if this isn't the case, it is far more likely that Joyboy was just the incarnation of Roger/Luffy in that era who strove for the most *freedom*.</TEXT>

I believe D. are the bloodline descendants of those who stood on the "right" side of the initial conflict in the Void Century, opposing the Heavenly Dragons obviously. Given that the Ancient Kingdom is directly referred to as having been "wiped out" by the WG by Professor Clover, and that they wish to keep its name secret, I feel too much stands in the way of AK=WG making sense.

    <DATE>2020-08-03 07:50:17</DATE>
    <TEXT>Recently Ashes of Creation, an MMO being developed by private funding and backers, has been getting a lot of viral youtuber hype. I've been following the project for a while, but now i took a closer look, and damn has CIG's history totally jaded me. The owner/creator keeps saying that he's funding it entirely by himself, and people on the fence should wait for release and just sub for 15 $ then to try it. Fair enough. *However* he's also selling 300$ Alpha access packages and like $1500 super prime whale deals. On top of that he can't stop talking about "fidelity" in every freaking podcast and interview he gives and my stomach immediately churns. To be fair, that project seems much more focused and far along than SC ever did, but I just hate how SC seriously damaged my ability to get hyped up for anything. I just can't trust any of these projects anymore. Edit: https://yy.reddit.com/r/AshesofCreation/comments/i2m0qx/just_bought_the_ashes_of_creation_voyager_pre/ Tell me this shit doesn't *reek* of SC circa 2013/2014. Edit edit: Intrepid Studios currently has plans for two unannounced projects within the Ashes of Creation universe. More on these projects will be released in the future as the development of our Flagship product, Ashes of Creation, nears its development milestones. Uh-oh.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>On the one hand, they seem to be focused quite well in terms of engine, scope etc. On the other hand, the scope of *systems* and modes seems too ambitious to hold true, and is also making me pause. A player-driven world full of gigantic dungeons, duels, arenas, castle sieges, city warfare, raids, guild wars, sea battles, caravan pvp.....yeah i dunno, it just strikes me as too big for its boots. They're also claiming to have a bunch of people from Planetside 2 on board, so they're confident on pulling off 250 v 250 and maybe even 500 v 500 sieges and battles......I laughed pretty hard at that, I've played thousands of hours in PS2 and while it's true it works pretty decently considering the scale of battles, the servers there still shit themselves and there are still issues with performance 10 years later almost.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>It's an important point, probably the most important imo. One of the reasons I can't get into most Asian MMOs and many of WoW's competitors is exactly that reason - even if they have good gameplay, good features, if the world leaves me cold or feels off somehow, my attention will wander. Wildstar was a good example, the world felt cartoony and generic as hell, nothing drew me in. Similarly, I felt Archeage and BDO were just generic "Asian waifu worlds", I didn't feel engaged whatsoever and the world did not interest me. Sometimes I watch current AoC footage, see butterfly racoon mounts and think to myself "boy, I hope they have somebody actually hammering out a precise artistic vision and lore framework, and it isn't just "this is fantasy, right?"".</TEXT>

    <TITLE>An honest question: Is the game fully funded or not? Some thoughts on seemingly conflicted messaging</TITLE>
    <DATE>2020-08-03 10:10:46</DATE>
    <TEXT>In recent interviews Steven has repeatedly stated that he's "fully funding the game himself". That struck me as disingenuous right off the bat, because after all there was a Kickstarter campaign that raised over $3 Million so why make that claim? Additionally, I'm confused as to why there are these pre-launch offers still around for backers if the game is "fully funded" and we should just wait for launch to try it out ourselves for a $ 15 fee. Yes, I'm aware it's a business and should turn a profit too, but why make these claims then? Which is it now, is the game fully funded and we should just wait to try it on launch, or are they in need of backers and whales paying hundreds, if not thousands, for basically .jpeg packages in early access? The discrepancy here comes across poorly to me. I'm not trying to be cynical or snarky here, I believe his sincerity in general, but I think it's very important to hit the right messages. We have several high profile examples out there right now of Kickstarter projects delayed into eternity and awful PR messaging/false promises etc, I would like to avoid AoC turning into that. I suspect this will harvest downvotes, but I'm not trying to accuse them of anything, just relaying an honest observation. I've seen too many comparable projects land in shady territory or garner bad reputations, both justified and unjustified, for poor communication or lack of transparency on that front. Edit: I feel some are misunderstanding my intent a bit, read some of the comments below for clarification. Also, the downvote function is not a "I disagree button".</TEXT>

Now he's been spouting that he's "fully funded" the game himself in multiple interviews, meanwhile estimates of his net worth don't come anywhere *near* covering a conservative estimate of development costs. At the same time they raised over $ 3 Million in a Kickstarter with stretch goals, and are offering whale packages up to $ 10,000.....

    <TEXT>I haven't compared it to anything specifically in terms of progress, just in terms of the unclear financing. His entry on "mogulpedia" estimates him at somewhere below $ 10 Mil. If you have other sources, I'd be interested to see. FYI Star Citizen has over $ 400 Mil in funding, also no NDA, and has hundreds of players on an Alpha. They've been doing that for quite a few years now, and made well over 250 Mil since they got into "Alpha". I'm not saying AoC is doing this as well, I'm saying there are good reasons to be very, very careful around these kinds of projects, and I'd like to eliminate any confusion for myself and others in terms of where the project stands. *Promises* mean absolutely nothing here, just keep that in mind.</TEXT>

My problem is with him per se, he says *exactly* what every MMO gamer wants to hear, and mixes it with flat out bullshit claims like that he's funded the entire game himself. The feature scope of the game also seems too unrealistic to pull off. I will keep following this and see how it does in a half year or so.

    <TEXT>Oh, I absolutely will. Out of principle I never pre-order or back anything before there is a working product that I can get my hands on. My approach is more along the lines of: - if they are completely upfront and honest about it, his easy-going, approachable interviews are making him put his foot in his mouth frequently which could throw some shade on the project ("fully funded by me", again it isn't, not even close by all accounts) - if there is some shady maneuvering going on it's best to pinpoint in quickly. Then again, people were calling SC a pie-in-the-sky ponzi scheme close to a decade ago and nobody listened, so I guess it's kinda pointless. I do hope it all turns out well, and would gladly spend my money on the game if and when it releases and comes even *close* to delivering on the potential.</TEXT>

They've lucrated over 400 Million and are nearly a decade in, and there is no way the single player game is coming out anytime soon, meanwhile the MMO part of the game is stuck in buggy, glitchy Alpha stage hell and has been for years. It's an utter catastrophe, tbh. I don't want AoC to turn out like that and burn the MMO community as the space sim community got burned, hence why i'm taking a closer look at this project. I'm more of an MMO player myself, and it strikes closer to my heart. I'll do my own research I guess, but I flat out call BS on the claim that he's "fully" funding it himself. There are apparently investors in the background, and at *least* several million were already raised via Kickstarter and sales since then, so it's just a disingenuous statement.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>AoC *does* have a lot of experienced people on the team, right from the start. Lots of MMO experience there, so have to defend them on that front. On the other hand though he's claimed as recently as 2018 that the game could be made for roughly 30 Million, while at the same time ramping up hirings to a team of over 200...I think it's easy to see where that would be a very *conservative* estimate for such a team size. Apparently they also have two other, undisclosed projects in the same universe going, which just gives me PTSD from CIG in terms of side projects and SQ42. And finally they were already trying to go for a hyped up Alpha in late 2018, and now we're in late 2020 and getting Alpha 1 "soon", while still selling xxx $ early access JPEG packs. I'm very wary of this project.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Yup he's promising way too much. And you're right, people are frequently fooled by great-looking visuals from work-in-progress, and think too little about the nitty-gritty of actual gameplay features and systems. I tried looking into his net worth, and there's very little I could find. He was part of an MDM company early on making some questionable money, then claims he made his fortune with real estate investment. He's claimed as recently as 2018 that the game would be made for roughly 30 Mil, which I call complete BS on, just like his claim that he fully funded it himself. Apparently there are private investors around, and they've taken in *at least* anywhere in the vicinity of 5 Mil from backers since 2017, if not a lot more ( they don't disclose this anywhere since the initial Kickstarter wrapped with 3,2 Mil generated).</TEXT>

We haven't even gotten all the art assets in place, yet alone all the promised features, and then we get into the part that takes the longest by far: getting rid of bugs and actual testing to see if what was worked on is fun in practice. 30 Mil is also a ridiculously conservative estimate, in 2018 they were already talking about at least 200 members in the team, add in licensing, infrastructure, etc etc etc Several *hundred* million is a far more realistic estimate.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>- of course they do, and i'm not saying they're not working on it, or "it's a scam!". But this is still early days. - you got a source for that quote? Where he actually states a number? Not that it would change much, because 30-40 Mil isn't enough to cover this project. - this is one of those points where him claiming to be funding the whole project strikes me as bogus. Yes he's wealthy, yes he's put a lot of money into it, but this project is never ever getting to release state with 30-40 Mil. We're not even in Alpha 1, we're years from anything close to release. - On the contrary, I don't think he's an idiot at all. He would indeed be a dolt for sinking as much money as he's claiming into the *initial* development phase of a quite risky game project. I doubt he'd bankrupt himself. - This thing isn't running on cash. No business venture does. Here's the thing: just based on what he's saying in interviews and the state of things, the game is at least several years from release, and he's claiming to fund the entire thing, meanwhile the only estimates of cost i've seen are wildly unrealistic. This means he's either severely underestimating the true costs, or the plan all along was to fund it into a presentable Alpha stage. At which point you can give it out to streamers, build hype, and generate a pledge/donation loop. This may sound cynical, and honestly it's not a bad idea, but it comes across as disingenuous to me. *Look* at comparable MMO projects and their costs. What he is proposing is on a scale that's practically never been done before, add the usual obscene infrastructure and maintenance costs of an MMO on top. This project is *never* going to fly on 30-40 Mil and then subs and cosmetics. I'm sure it took them at least this far, but that's probably about it - and probably why we're generating buzz for Alpha now. It's not a matter of competence (well, I hope, at least), but of transparency. I'd appreciate an interview or a podcast where they go into the nitty-gritty of where they are now funds-wise, how they're planning/estimating costs and the coverage into release, etc. Right now it's pretty muddy. He says he's funding it, but the amounts quoted aren't enough. If they *are* i'd like a rough explanation of why this project, which is larger in scale than most comparable products, is so much *cheaper* to make. At the same time they're still taking early access pledges and purchases. *Obviously* they will want to make money with it, and that's not a bad thing. It's a *business*, not a pro bono project. As a potential backer, I just want to get a detailed business plan, like any investor would. A Kickstarter is beholden to the backers, as they would be to investors. Player goodwill is a commodity, and a very valuable one at that. You can support projects like this nearly indefinitely if you do it right (look at StarCitizen), and I would like this project to put the right foot forward in that respect early, and not gamble on "well let's hope it really is in releasable state in a few years and we don't have to fall back on selling JPEG packages to beg for pledges". Transparency early on is very important, now more than ever with the history of so many other crowdfunded projects imploding.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I kind of believe the aim of the project was to get it into presentable Alpha stage to then enter a sustainable pledge cycle. Maybe they'll prove me wrong, and heck if it works and they actually release a game unlike CIG, it will be the right move. But nobody can earnestly claim to be "fully funding" this kind of game for around 30-40 Mil. And it's so convenient that he happens to call in with major MMO streamers to give off-the-cuff interviews and generate viral hype a few months before intended Alpha 1 launch.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Deep, and cool analysis. I think it's likely more literal though. As in, he's a mythical dragon of good fortune, and quite literally cannot die to injury or self-harm. That was the point of his introductory chapter, imo. He's so bored with the state of things, he actually tries to kill himself. I don't think falling out of the sky somewhere with a relatively small audience, who seem to be there by coincidence, is a good basis for a legendary death. He's actually trying to die. He's a nihilist, a chauvinist and a bully. I do think you're right in a way that Oden impressed him. Unlike him, Oden was embracing death for honour, without fear, *despite* not being full of ennui and lethargy, in fact he had family and a country to live for and enjoy. *That's* why he's haunted by Oden's spirit, he cannot fully understand that motivation. At least that's my take.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I only just realized that the game is still online. I used to be a big fan, played for several years had multiple raiding characters. The last time I briefly checked was during the Savage Coast update I believe. What's the state of the game? There's a raid finder now, apparently? Have they done anything to improve leveling since adding the Khitain zone, or is it still Villa/grinding for ages at later levels? I know it's been in maintenance mode for a long time, so not expecting any new content. But have they maybe adjusted XP across mid- to late level zones, stuff like that? Is Khitai outdoors actually scaled properly now? I loved that place but it was so gated and overscaled that most didn't even get in.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I've seen all of this, it doesn't change what i've been saying. Yes according to Steven it's "fully funded". If you know even a little about MMO development though you know that cannot be true for the intended scale of the game at this stage, with the amounts quoted. Not by a *long* shot. As for almost being in Alpha - first off, plans are just that plans. Apparently they had intended to go into Alpha almost two years ago and then relapsed, so there's always that (happens in any development, nothing unusual there, just take plans with a pinch of salt for multiple reasons). Secondly, even when they enter Alpha, they will have been in development with several hundred employees for up to three years, and development until release will take another 2-3 years *at least*. I don't think you fully appreciate how early in development this game still is. The groundwork has barely been laid, they're still working on basics. Testing and bug-fixing takes even longer, to say nothing of inevitable "well this didn't work, back to the drawing board" phases in Alpha. While they aren't selling Alpha1 access, they most certainly are selling access to later stages. Again, I don't think there's a scam going on, but we're in the danger zone that Star Citizen abused, where people get super hyped over, well, basically just promises and an idea, and they generate a steady stream of revenue from "dreamers". I would urge you to take a step back, and view it in the context of what other Kickstarter projects did, what is actually *in the build of the game* when Alpha 1 actually does launch, how much work is left to be done, etc. Once again: given the current state of development, the rough number of employees, the years it has already been in development, and the claimed total costs compared with the sheer scope of features that are intended to be implemented, it starts to feel less and less coherent.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Is there a dungeon finder too btw? Raid finder can be a blessing and a curse. I've played hardcore raiding WoW for almost 12 years, and in that game I never approved of it. The community was so large and active, there was no real excuse for the convenience. However AoC is tiny, and was tiny in its heyday too in comparison. Enabling ease of access to endgame content is not a bad thing for the game, I imagine. On top of that, the raids in AoC are a lot simpler in terms of mechanics compared to the higher difficulties in games like WoW, making them a lot more suitable to pugging. I understand they significantly scaled down the numbers, which is good for access. The lore in the raids especially was awesome, like in Jade Citadel, but barely a handful of players per server ever got to see them back in the day, so I think it's good they opened it up a bit, waste of content development otherwise.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>It really depends on how vulnerable the targeted program is one the one hand, and how easily detectable the bots are on the other. And on how easy it is to disable the mechanism used to automate inputs. It's always been a cold war back and forth behind the scenes of these types of games between botters/RMTers/3rd party elements and devs. Sometimes it gets out of hand, sometimes it feels like bots are a non-issue. I'm not sure how one would modify this approach, again just individually instantly banning bots is problematic for multiple reasons. For one, you need to be sure of your detection before banning.

    <TEXT>You do realize that parsing combat logs is a thing in practically any MMO that doesn't have built-in DPS meters or addons for it? Like, the perception that this game will somehow not have players measuring their output just because the devs don't want to integrate it is absurd. Log parsing absolutely will be a thing in the dedicated raiding community, as will finding the most optimal builds etc. This being a thing has never stopped people that don't care about that still completing content with whatever they want to play, so the entire complaint is silly.</TEXT>

    <TITLE>Some thoughts on DPS Meters, "elitism" and "entitlement"</TITLE>
    <DATE>2020-08-06 08:04:21</DATE>
    <TEXT>I've been seeing quite a few back-and-forth comments concerning whether DPS Meters should be in the game, and what they mean for the community. As far as I'm aware, Intrepid are not planning to implement any kind of such functionality into the game. Some have taken this as a sign to celebrate a more "inclusive" approach and seem to think that this means there will be no measuring sticks in AoC. I have a few thoughts on this. First off, whether the developers build an ingame functionality for measuring output/performance or not, *it will exist*. Every single MMO has had them, and will continue to do so. Parsing text from combat logs is a simple thing, and will be done. And this isn't a bad thing. The majority of dedicated players, as in, players that spend a significant amount of time in the game and are interested in advancing their characters as much as possible, care a lot about being able to measure their performance/setup, and finding the optimal build. Depending on how challenging "endgame" PvE content is, or even advanced PvP for that matter, dedicated guilds will *absolutely* seek to establish metrics to measure applicants and performance. This is a completely normal trend, it's not "toxic" and it certainly isn't detrimental to the game. Next up, performance measuring existing doesn't mean that the game is exclusive to elitist hardcore players or has nothing to offer for casuals. Especially in a world as player-driven as AoC is striving to be, in a world that will - hopefully - have a vibrant player-driven economy, deep crafting systems and lots of little "jobs" to do in a large node community, there are niches to progress in for most players. This differs quite a bit from more straightforward PvE-oriented themepark type games such as World of Warcraft, where the entire game, which is heavily story-driven, leads up to endgame content, which is raiding. It is here that problems with player access and exclusivity begin and end. Even in games that are notorious for pushing optimization metas and gatekeeping content based on gear and performance, there are always ways to play "whatever you want", as long as you find the right community to support that. The more player-driven the universe, the more likely you will find that mindset. This is a question of perception vs reality, when too many players don't engage in social groups in the game such as guilds which suit their preferred playstyle, and start to believe that the game is only based on aspects they see popular streamers push, or build guides recommend. TL;DR: AoC will have dedicated hardcore raiding communities. They will find ways to measure performance, they will optimize their setups. And they will be exclusive to more dedicated and active players. Whether or not DPS meters are an ingame functionality. Don't worry too much about it if you're not interested, the more player-driven the world, the more there will be to do for casual players. Edit: I think it's fairly interesting that up/downvotes are so split on this topic. Given some of the comments, I suspect a lot of people aren't even reading the post but just reacting to buzzwords and injecting their bias. Hey, it's reddit. But I think it says a lot about the strange state very basic MMO mechanics are in for parts of the playerbase. Edit edit: Apparently, this requires clarification: I am NOT asking for DPS meters. I'm discussing why they exist, why they will exist in some form in AoC, and why it's not a big deal in the first place for anyone not interested in hardcore endgame content.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Why the hell would they ever try to ban people who measure performance for damage or healing or whatever. That strikes me as absurd. I'm also fairly certain they won't go to excessive lengths to "prevent" combat-logging. They know very well that the hardcore subset of players, those that are typically the longest-running subs and most dedicated whales at times, will want a way to measure their builds. Just because they won't supply an ingame tool for it (which, btw, basically no MMO does anyway) doesn't mean they will go to any lengths to prevent players from mining that data on their own.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>This couldn't be further from the truth in high-end raiding in WoW, for example. Being able to deliver the numbers is the *baseline* requirement, and needs to be measured. Then comes the aspect of awareness, movement and coordination while pulling that off, which is far, far harder and what makes it challenging. You could argue the same for advanced MOBA play really. Sure your average players will just look at their numbers and obsess about them, the high end takes those as granted and the difference makers are other factors.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Because it's the only metric you can judge based on a parse, the rest is observation and experience. This is why numbers are used as goalposts in games like WoW in pugging, you're trying to establish a baseline for minimum requirements to not drag a group down, because there *are* numerical requirements to encounters. If a player still fucks up colossaly afterwards and doesn't adapt or learn, the group can (and usually will) still exclude him or her.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Most of these indirectly or directly correlate to output numbers though. The higher your damage, the shorter the fight, the fewer....etc, you see where i'm going with this. Also, you should consider what you're suggesting. If the stance were truly to shift the challenge away from damage/hp scaling even *more* into bullet hell maneuvering and coordination (than it already is in most current PvE-focused endgame metas), that would be *worse* for casual and solo players. The exclusion criteria at the high end are not really the numbers, those are easy to achieve. It's being able to multitask, have awareness and move while doing so. Evaluating numbers in the *context* of encounter demands is what raiders really want.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I guess i'm not sure what you're proposing, or what your issue is. Most complex raid encounters in big MMOs already work that way. They're a combination of having the right damage and mitigation as well as specific mechanics like dodging/moving, coordinating as a group, targeting the right things, exploiting exposed weaknesses etc. Practically no successful MMO has only "raid dummy" type fights that are just tank amp;spank, when they do they are usually early fights that are just there to set scaling points for your group to overcome to be ready for later, more complex fights. Even if you could "easily" determine that your raid needs more dps to overcome a certain breakpoint, that's just a part of the puzzle, and doesn't detract from the rest of the challenges.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Literally look up like 99% of Mythic level encounters in WoW raiding for the past...uuuh...8-10 years? There are usually some simpler fights early on in an instance, but they are rare. Most fights involve multiple phases with varying degrees of requirement movement, coordination and priority targeting, at times this can become *very* complex, and some fights even got famous for almost requiring 3rd party addons to properly manage. For the record, i've also done high level raiding in Age of Conan, The Secret World, SWTOR, Rift ....and I think that's about it, sometimes I forget one or two. Most of the other games are vastly simpler in raiding, but usually still entail certain unintuitive, non-dps related mechanics that you have to figure out (especially in AoC and TSW, the Funcom games). SWTOR and Rift raids were more similar to WoW in that you had lots of ground-targeted mechanics to avoid and specific vulnerability phases or components to target etc.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I'm not sure why you want to harp on about this, but off the top of my head there's a debuff to move out with and split into groups on the fly, there's a mechanic to dispel off at a certain distance and with precise movement, there's another you want to dispel inside on either side, for specific types in the raid to pick up to get buffed, else the timers are unmanageable. Messing up even one of those aspects is already pretty much a wipe in proper progress. It's hard enough mastering this as a group with a guide spoonfeeding you a few weeks after release, try doing this virtually blind and better yet, try progressing this without any kind of combat logging or parsing to actually learn from as you progress. FYI that was just Phase 1, the fight gets way more hectic and chaotic in the last two phases (there's an intermission too). I'm not arguing that AoC needs to be similarly complex in endgame PvE. 99% it won't be, because frankly WoW has 15 years of experience with it and will probably never be reached in that respect, and it doesn't have to be in order for a competitor to be a great game. AoC offers other things, and that's good. However, high-end PvE will exist, most definitely, and they ahve already described typical points of scaling difficulty with new mechanics being added as your group performs etc. *THAT* performance is 100% based on killspeed, damage taken, etc etc...there will be logging already core to the way the game determines difficulty. It is a dead given that logs will be at play outside of the game, and that optimal setups will be determined, as well as benchmarks for maximized output. That's not a *bad* thing, and it won't detract from the casual experience is what i'm saying.</TEXT>

Like don't get me wrong, i think the game will have a lot of appeal for casuals. But it's looking like 3-5 hour dungeons/raids and half-day PvP events given the scale.

    <TEXT>The problem in WoW is that raiding is the *only* progress meta for the vast majority, numerical output is the only thing to measure progress by. You don't have player-driven events and politics, etc. And the entire game tunnels the player into the raids as what they should do. This is what exascerbates the toxicity and bickering.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Following your logic, players should be mostly left guessing as to why they fail an encounter given the lack of data. Stephen has made similarly baffling comments  #224; la "it's more fun to miss the target while blindfolded". This doesn't make sense, and in fact leads to even more elitism because access to metrics will require more effort. AoC won't have lfg or lfr afaik, so there's already quite a bit of effort involved in getting to raid-type encounters. It's not a casual game by any means.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>This is something i see a lot of people assuming - that casual players won't be excluded from high end content. However, the way AoC is being described it will require a lot more dedication and social cohesion to achieve "endgame" results compared to a themepark PvE setting with raids at the end. Player-driven environments tend to be even *more* elitist and exclusive at the high end given the effort involved.</TEXT>

The only place i've ever encountered toxic behaviour is in WoW pugs and lfd/lfg. Essentially, where anonymous access with no social repercussions in you server community exists.

    <TEXT>Big surprise, selfish and bad players exist. In fact, they are the majority. Only you're looking at it the wrong way. Meters existing did not foster that. In fact, combat logging allows good raid leaders to clearly discern the tunneling bads from those executing mechanics well. What you're describing is the lower end of raiding. No good higher difficulty raiding team praises spriest A for having stood still and tunneled 30% more dps, while spriest B soaked 20 instances of a mechanic they were assigned to. And trust me, i've played in Vanilla raiding without logs as well as in multiple other games for long durations before parsing - bad and/or selfish players act the same and exist either way. Whether logging promotes or hinders their behavior depends on the raid leadership and how you look at data.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Re: "DPS meters are immersion-breaking". I don't agree at all in an MMO. If that element of a UI is immersion-breaking, so is basically all the rest of the UI, so is getting damage numbers on your hits, so is getting markers for ground targeting abilities, etc etc. The thing is, you can't really pull off MMO functionality while going full RPG-style immersion with practically no UI. DPS Meters aren't the culprits there, they're just another aspect of a set of circumstances that you won't ever really change. Sure, you can deactivate your UI in most MMOs just for visual splendour, but you can't really play effectively that way, and barely anyone would.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Good exchange here. BDO and FFIV are two of the few MMOs i've not really engaged in at a high level, but from what i gather from a WoW guildmate of mine who plays a lot, it is just as /u/Bainik describes - a rather passive-aggressive system where people just get kicked without knowing why, but they still get kicked for underperforming nontheless. Hardly a good "solution", to my mind. I had also heard of the clusterdump that was BDO PvE "endgame", and i'm afraid that game is not a good example to bring up as a workable MMO PvE endgame without logging, quite the contrary it underscores why not having measurable data screws the community over even more.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>The less data available, the *more* a community depends on the 0.1% to trickle down empirical data, the less cross-verifiying and -checking, etc. It's perfectly fine to dismiss the need for theorycrafting and output measuring in, for example, themepark MMOs with barely any proper group or raid encounters to speak of. But in a game as obviously focused on the hardcore MMO crowd, with massive player-involvement at every stage, with a class system as bloated as is being proposed, theorycrafting based on numbers is an absolute inevitability. Sabotaging community efforts to theorycraft and optimize just leads to frustration and, ironically, toxicity, as other games have empirically demonstrated.</TEXT>

It's obvious that most of the "bleh dps meters and logs, go away optimization bads!" comments are coming from people who either haven't touched high end raiding in years or basically never, and are coming from a very uninformed position. High end raiding (not just in WoW) has come a long way, and is pretty much a different universe from early days MMOs. The skill requirements are *vastly* greater, and I say this as someone who pretty much continued progressing from Vanilla WoW to the end of Legion as well as in other games.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Here'S the thing: the more PvE content is OwPvP-based, and the less it is instanced, and the more player-driven the world, the less casual-friendly it will be. This is a major aspect of why I do not understand or agree with Steven's comments on "DPS meters are toxic" so far, because what he is proposing is an extremely hardcore-oriented endgame meta. Yes you can easily "run in" as a casual and participate in *some* aspects, but you will have 0 chance to fight through a desirable raid that opened up in a populated node against coordinated, optimized groups sitting on those tasty grinding spots, and even less chance of getting through to actual raid fights in there. It won't just be a dragon popping into existence outside of your lvl 5-10 town, and everyone gets to tag it once. Sure, stuff like that will exist i'm sure, but meta will be gated behind being part of dedicated groups that optimize setup, build and time dedication. I again return to the example of EVE as a good indicator of what desirable PvE endgame looks like when it is locked behind OwPvP endgagement and scaling stats.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>AoC will absolutely not be a typical Western MMO, if we are to go by anything that is being proposed. I see a *lot* of WoW-type players in comments on social media and here getting excited, but missing a few key points. - most WoW and typical Western MMO players will *not* enjoy "permanent" OwPvP. There's a healthy number of PvP MMO players, but they are just a part of the cake, and the real "whales" are usually the PvE-focused crowd - itemization as has been proposed goes contrary to what people enjoy in most Western ARPGs and MMOS. That is, random good stuff dropping rarely from trash mobs anywhere for example. Instead, the proposed system is basically the Asian MMO grindsystem of fighting for spots and just amassing tons of base items that you break down for materials to have a *chance* to upgrade your gear. Most people do *not* enjoy that in the West, and I don't see many people excited by AoC being aware of that meta right now. - as it is a player-driven world/sandbox, exclusivity of high tier content will be *worse*, not better, than a typical instanced content Western game. For an example of what PvE looks like in a OwPvP world, check out EVE Online. You basically won't be able to engage in a lot of endgame content without being part of a dedicated, organized group and putting in a lot of effort. Not so dissimilar to Western high tier endgame in that respect, but they tried to make compromises by offering scaled-down, easily accessible versions of instanced content. This will not happen in AoC by all accounts. - no queueing for content, no teleporting into instances. This is something that will definitely help the MMO feel of the world, but which a *lot* of younger players and modern Western MMO audiences are absolutely not used to. In short, I think people need to tone down their expectations a little bit if they're coming from the PvE side of things in a typical Western MMO. It doesn't mean they won't enjoy AoC, but it will be a radically different type of game to what they are used to. Personally, I'm excited for aspects of what is being proposed, in other areas i'm highly skeptical of them pulling it off to the degree being envisioned, and some elements like the itemization system I outright dislike.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Anyone who has ever followed more transparent development should know that AoC is in *very* early stages. A lot of what is being proposed is nowhere near being implemented in a testable form, and is just an idea on paper. Indulge the ideas, discuss them, but don't get too excited by ideas before you see things play out in a live testing environment. In other words - cool visuals and graphics are relatively easy to make, whereas working systems, gameplay loops, balance and establishing meta is where the majority of development time and testing goes to, and where MMOs succeed or fail.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I do think that the characters who have only one name such as Shanks and Kaido have a reason for that. Shanks' name will likely be a big reveal. I think you're on the right path with the theory, though i'm not sure about the details. The biggest point in support of it is the fact that Shanks is apparently allowed to waltz into Marie Geoise and meet with the Gorosei. I highly doubt Big Mom or Kaido would have been able to do the same. Similarly, I think it's probably part of why him showing up at Marineford effectively ended the battle, it wasn't just the weight of another yonko crew showing up, but his position in the scheme of things. Rocks is probably part of a big reveal, he's set up to be highly relevant. Most likely Kaido/Big Mom will spill the beans in the next 20-30 chapters as to the real story behind God Valley.</TEXT>

Right now it's just a lot of ideas and a skeleton implementation, so i can't really make any estimations just yet. But yes, it will be hard to avoid going too far into the Asian action combat. ESO had a semi-decent balance between action and tab targeting imo, but it also felt awkward and janky, and was very counterintuitive to optimize.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I wouldn't bet any money on it. At the very least, i'd never bet on any of them releasing with everything they promised at the outset. Most of them have very bloated and unrealistic feature lists and scope, if they do get made it will be several years before a roughly playable build is out there with everything implemented. Take a look at the history of Star Citizen for a woeful reminder of how kickstarter game development usually goes with lofty ambitions.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I'm currently back in Age of Conan, it's a crap ton of content for free. AoC is really a love it or hate it kind of game. The graphics are nice, though at times outdated, but poorly optimized. Combat system is very unique and engaging, though it can get annoying with certain specs and at certain leveling stages. Levelling is where most players turn away. The starting area of Tortage from 1-20 is fantastic, after that the core game takes a nosedive with long stretches of unfinished content and missing questing. They improved on that with Gateway to Khitai, part of the Khitai expansion, which is a newer, better designed zone which lasts from 20-40. When you do reach lvl 80 and endgame, you've got Khitai, a fantastic expansion with amazing soundtrack, story and dungeons. And the game is actually fairly populated these days and even has a raid finder. Heavily recommend, if you find you enjoy the style and gameplay.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>The point is that in a game *heavily* oriented towards dedicated, more hardcore players, taking steps to hinder optimization for fear of it being "toxic" comes across as bubble-think, and not particularly realistic. DPS meters (or combat logging, rather) aren't *required* for more challenging content, they just enable optimization and theorycrafting in a genre completely based around build and group compositions. Sure, you *can* do without all of it - there's just absolutely no point to doing that besides irritating the playerbase that is likely to spend the most time and the most money on the product. No, it isn't going to be Mythic WoW progress raiding, I think most people understand that. Combat logging and analysis of output exists nontheless in pretty much every single other MMO that involves...well, *numbers* of any kind in combat.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>You don't glue your eyes to a meter while playing though, it's a UI element to be browsed in between fights, glanced at out of the corner of your eye if checking for something specific, or more commonly, a parse to be analyzed at leisure after a run or after experimenting on a dummy for testing purposes, etc. Every single MMO i've ever played is full of UI elements that detract from the purist RPG combat you're describing (basically, Elder Scrolls style), and there are reasons for that imo. Immersion that works in single player environments can quickly lead to frustration and annoyance in MMO settings, especially where PvP is involved. The less you understand in terms of data - not just flinching animations etc - what is going on, the more a player might get frustrated with skill or gear gaps, fail to understand what *actually took place* in any given situation (PvP interactions in MMOs typically have dozens of skill interactions going on within seconds, you cannot learn from this or improve without data feedback). But I appreciate where you're coming from, and can understand the deliberation. I just don't think it *is* worth it in a multiplayer setting.</TEXT>

Whether you're *aware* of it or not, people were parsing logs to analyze data. You're actually making my point perfectly that the *existence* of combat logging has no impact whatsoever on the parts of the community that don't care for it, and that the issue with "toxicity" as described by Steven and others, has a lot more to do with endgame design and community itself e.g. in WoW.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Been back in the game for a few days, having fun. Question: has there been any solo/outdoor content added for high level characters post-Khitai? My two main characters are fully faction-geared from Khitai, and can basically only progress their gear with HM dungeons and T3+ raids, and i'm looking for some stuff to do in the meantime. Does Dragon Spine contain some questing/grinding spots apart from the dungeons/raids there? How about Turan? I remember questing there around 40/50 on an alt years ago, but can't recall if it has high level content. Unfortunately there seems to be very little info floating around apart from isolated posts on forums and the barebones wiki.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I mean...that *is* the epicenter of ARPGs, period. There is only so far you can take deterministic crafting/loot without basically ruining the core of long term motivation to play in this genre. In that sense, I absolutely agree with their statement. Is there room in the game to introduce a more balanced avenue for deterministic crafting? Absolutely. But Harvest crafts as they exist in-league are way too powerful. This doesn't just apply to the "1%", it's the same argument as one would make against ease of access for trading (vis-a-vis AH) - it drastically reduces time and effort involved in progressing, and cuts the meat and gravy of ARPG gameplay off at the feet. The game *is* the hunt, the pulling of the one-armed bandit on every pack/map/boss. I know some people get burned out by all that RNG, and there is certainly an argument to be made that PoE could tread a little more lightly on those levers, but in essence, *you think you do, but you really don't*. Short term, a lot of players would enjoy permanent access to easier upgrades straight into "BiS" gear. Long term, drastically fewer people would keep playing long term, and you'd get less enjoyment out of the game.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I see a lot of people making a fair and reasonable statement like yours, /u/castellorizon, but unfortunately also a lot of unreflected "without Harvest or deterministic crafting like in H, i won't play anymore". This is what Mathil was reacting to, and this is what a lot of us are reacting to when we dismiss it. I understand that more deterministic crafting feels good, but there has to be a healthy balance. Too much easy access devalues the core ARPG gameplay immensely. ARPGs *are* RNG simulators, slot machines, whatever you want to call them. The minute you grant too much access to easy upgrades, you undercut the core gameplay loop and point of the game. As an example, D3 has pretty straightforward upgrade paths. Yes I know, different meta, etc. But the fact remains D3 is set up in a way where you *know* you will get your set items and the stuff you're after in a matter of *hours* usually. It's one of the reasons why seasons have been DoA in that game for many years, because ppl play for a few days and then leave when they have nothing to do but roll alts or grind the GR meta forever for minor upgrades of the same gear. Meanwhile, PoE has a) an economy that needs to be considered and b) *does* have a complex and rich crafting system in place. Yes, we've all heard now that "it's too much gambling involved". And they should definitely experiment with how much can be allowed. But a lot of people here are instantly *demanding* that Harvest levels of deterministic upgrade paths remain, and that simply cannot stand. The game *was* completely broken with Harvest crafting, that level of power access cannot remain for the long term health of the game. It's not an easy thing to simply throw these types of mechanics into the next league in some form. There needs to be careful deliberation and weighting of factors. I've also seen lots of people compare this discussion to easier access to maps and the likes. Apples and oranges. I really don't think most people who are insisting on "Harvest core, asap" get the whole picture. Finally, I have to leave one provocative point: Harvest did not "open crafting for many". It gave many an editor function for their gear. No more people will engage with orb-crafting and research how to accomplish high tier gear with crafting post-Harvest than did before, because it has basically nothing to do with PoE's crafting. I understand for some that was a welcome change, for most of us it's just another unique league mechanic, and one that will ultimately have an influence on the core meta but is definitely not implementable fully in its current form.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>It's likely a mix of factors. A lot of players simply hated the garden mechanic and were disinterested due to lack of real content in the league. On the high end, I can't imagine many hardcore players quitting early, as they for sure enjoyed playing around with an item editor in the game. Long term though I feel a lot of more dedicated players probably left a bit earlier than usual due to Harvest being too "easy", really. I certainly did. The combination of lack of new content in maps etc as well as Harvest making progress a joke really cut into my motivation to keep playing.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I feel like the issue is lack of knowledge and awareness more so than lack of progress potential. People are suddenly acting like straightforward progression is impossible in PoE without massive luck and playing the casino. This is just...straight up not true. It's basically the same argument as "help i can't sustain maps" again, because people simply *don't put in the time and research on how to do it*. Now, you can make an argument that there's a discussion to be had on whether the game needs to be a bit more accessible, streamlined and simplified in that regard. But I think PoE became successful as a game that does *not* hand you everything on a platter, and should stay relatively true to that flair.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>The core issue is that most players don't understand or don't care about how to generate profit without too much effort in a trading game. While I can understand that, I feel too many players are pushing their own expectations of what *they* want to see into a game that has a flourishing and healthy playerbase doing something that these players who feel they are "left out" *do not* enjoy. So why should the game change for their sake, really? You could debate forever whether GGG might make more money being more "inclusive" and simplified in their design approach, but that's really what people are asking for I feel. I don't like it, personally. Just like Mathil said, for a lot of us PoE became a haven to run to from other gamers where growing playerbases pushed their entitlement along the lines of "i paid for this, so i deserve to have easier access to the rewards of the gameplay loop". I don't want to see the same dynamic start here.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>The fact that it *is* so long is one of the appeals, imo. Oda has crafted a rich and vibrant world, his story rarely if ever feels like it is treading water or wasting time. Instead, you constantly feel like you're being teased with morsels of a world you want to learn more about, always. One Piece is going to go down in history as a pinnacle of world-building and a textbook example of the art of the "slow burn" in storytelling.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I'm a huge Age of Conan fan, so take my feedback with a grain of salt considering my bias. However, i've also played *far* more WoW and been deep into most other MMOs out there over the past 20 years. In my opinion, Age of Conan is still pretty unique and well worth trying, *especially* as a Conan fan. Pros and cons: Pros: AoC has a very unique combat system which combines tab targetting for spells with action combat (arrow keys are your directional weapon swings, and you execute combos later for more damage). The graphics, while outdated at times for the models and certain areas feel barren (more on that later), are still beautiful in most areas that gameplay is concentrated in. Some unique class options that you won't find in other MMOs, like a sword-wielding cloth-wearing fire mage who turns into a demon on demand, and healers who deal heal through dealing more damage and play in melee. An absolutely *fantastic* soundtrack throughout basically all of the game and the expansions. It's free-to-play, and you will have dozens of hours of enjoyable gameplay for free before you would want to spend any money to gain more playfields, classes etc if you so choose. The subscription is also pretty cheap nowadays at I believe 8  #8364; and grants access to everything. It has some fantastic story and lore, if you're a Howard fan, you will love the world. They have a raid finder now as well as regular world boss events, so there is actually fairly accessible and easy group content even for very casual players at max level. The community is quite active and there are plenty of guilds to join, in various languages. Cons: The issues which plagued the game back in 2008 are still quite relevant today. Namely, two things: bad optimization (the game still doesn't run very smoothly on a lot of setups/settings) and a dearth of content for certain parts of leveling. AoC was rushed by the publishers, so that the devs had spent a *lot* of time on the starting zone (which is fantastic, and largely considered to be one of the best in any MMO), as a result large stretches of content after level 20 until 80 felt pretty empty and generic in comparison. This was somewhat alleviated with new playfields added in the expansion Rise of the Godslayer, as well as some adventure packs later on, so one did have well-designed questing playfields for the majority of the leveling process (also, XP potions) and did not have to grind anymore to reach endgame. But it still remains a noticable flaw. It is also a fairly dated game. You will notice things like the UI design, loot and combat can, at times, feel very....mid-00s, for lack of a better word. Personally I don't mind, as it still feels very unique and i always loved the feel. But it puts some people off. Summary: If you're a Howard fan, or generally a fantasy MMO fan on the lookout for something new, TRY IT. It's free for a *lot* of content.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>It was an MMO of the times, but unlike the competitors it had a unique combat system, classes no other MMO had, an adult and immersive atmosphere. To dismiss it for the typical MMO design of the time is pretty silly, imo. If you enjoy typical MMO gameplay, you will enjoy AoC. If you don't...it's...just not for you? That's not a flaw of the game, it's just personal preference. The game also has excellent dungeons and raids with fantastic atmosphere, soundtrack, visuals and often tricky mechanics that aren't served on a platter with indicators etc. It has a rich feeling of adventure that most other MMOs lack, in my opinion. I'm not so sure what other gameplay you're looking for in an MMO, tbh.</TEXT>

It won't ever be worth sitting and grinding somewhere for those drops, but they happen and can be fun to get while leveling as upgrades, or to sell on the market sometimes (there's also a cosmetic vanity slot so some items sell for just the look). AoC also has treasure chests all over the world, daily challenges to find some as well as achievements to do lots of exploring, grinding etc.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>As I suspected, apples and oranges. Really? Comparing games like Eve and Planetside or Sims Online with WoW and AoC? Come on. Most of the games *barely* have anything in common as a genre except for the fact that they are persistent online worlds and you can gain XP, and that's about where it ends. They are not even remotely comparable in most cases. EQ1 is "unique" compared to WoW and "WoW clones"? Are you joking? It's literally the blueprint for the gameplay you describe as dull and boring. Many of the other older MMOs you mentioned lacked questing structure, instead you just had to...you know, grind boar butts for ages to level. Fantastic game design, truly. There is a reason EQ/WoW's concept was copied - it works. You may not enjoy questing, reading quest texts or whatever. In that case, *that particular genre* may not be for you. But it's not a flaw in the game's design. AoC had a healthy mix of generic "kill x" quests as well as pretty immersive story stuff. You didn't like AoC, fine and dandy. But your parameters for comparison (to other games at the time) are arbitrary. I love your constant harping on about "it's linear!". Like, what is your measuring stick here? Are you seriously going to sit here and claim that DAOC style of endless grind, player-driven sandbox gameplay pre-WoW is the only "true typical MMO", because you say so? "Wow's very limited and casual design". Ah yes, we all miss the days of not having development resources or the technical means to design any immersive or meaningful content. I'm sure the immersion you enjoyed beating a respawning lizard to death with 20 others is unmatched in more contemporary world and story design.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I would like to add that by no means is AoC perfect (as I mentioned in my longer comment above in response to OP). The quality control in Funcom has always been terrible, it was riddled with bugs, performance issues and a long stretch of very little content after Tortage on release. Partially that was mitigated later, but the damage was done. PvP was always a broken mess, many features promised earlier were never implemented - however AoC is certainly not the only game that happens to.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Thankfully I never spent a dime and only tested on free events and stuff like that. But back in the day, what *really* got me excited was not the interactive movie of SQ42. The Best Damn Space Sim ever...that was Freespace 2. Having played that to death with my brother as a teenager, and having fallen in love with the *concept* and feel of EVE Online (not so much the gameplay later on), what I imagined, what I *heard* being promised, was the perfect synergy of those worlds. A universe as complex and interactive as EVE, but with real cockpit combat. Not just fighters, but capital ships, and freighters, etc. That's what I wanted, that's what I hoped for. I did not want an FPS, i did not want hyper-realistic graphics, heck i didn't even need or want the ability to land on any planet, because fuck it it wasn't necessary for *what I wanted to play*. Literally, make EVE's gameplay decent cockpit/joystick flying, and that'll do it. That'll scratch the itch for so many. Every year they added modules and shit nobody ever asked for, I despaired more. When they finally broke out the planets and landing on "everything you see", it was the end for me. I knew I would *never* get what I wanted, because the game would be stuck in "hyper fidelity" limbo in simulating a limited environment, with devs scrambling to get condensation effects on cockpit panes right as your ship plummeted through cloud layers etc</TEXT>

They just drown everything in marketing lingo and empty buzzwords, adjust roadmaps, and maintain that everything is in a state that's not ready to be critiqued. It's probably the biggest flaw in the entire company in my opinion, for a venture that brands itself as "100% transparent and beholden to you, the backer", they have disgustingly deceiving and misleading communication. If you want an example of a company doing transparency and communication right, look to GGG (Path of Exile). They rely on MTX transactions and player goodwill for their revenue, and they do it *right*.</TEXT>

ELITE is delivering not just the space sim, but going forward with planetary content as well. Other games like SW: Squadrons are going for the "high fidelity space combat" niche in particular. SC is just rapidly starting to look dated and outpaced.

    <TEXT>In reference to the PvP part: avoid PvP in AoC. It's been a broken mess from the start, as far as I know the PvP realm is a grief fest, there are lots of people exploiting/cheating, and balance was terrible from the get-go. Some people engage in instanced arena stuff and there are specific pvp zones on the pve realm as well, but it's mostly salt, drama and not a lot of fun gameplay. They were planning on guild warfare, sieges etc, but that never really came to pass.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>A big part of the puzzle is that in those 15 years, publishers discovered the *vastly* higher profitability of mobile games. Most big studios won't go for large-scale MMOs anymore as they cost far more to make and run. The bubble popped. Of course, the market is still quite large, and plenty of games have and do make a lot of money in the MMORPG genre. And yes, SC is at best a colossal crowdfunding fiasco, at worst an outright scam at this point. Stay well away. Only the future will tell whether Ashes of Creation actually turns into something other than crowdfunding hype.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I don't think we can tell yet how some of these stories might be connected. I think it's a pretty safe bet that Goda will take his time. He's one of the *very* few mangaka in history that will get *literally zero* pressure from his publishers to wrap this up quickly. He's also one of the very few who has planned his tale out so far in advance, he knows where all of this is going, but more ideas and additions keep popping in on the way. So I think there's 0 chance of this turning into another *Bleach* scenario, for example. (I'd be more scared of a *Berserk* scenario where there is still so long to go, but the mangaka has health issues or burnout)</TEXT>

    <TEXT>That is 100% nonsense concerning the pressure on Goda. OP is a gigantic cash cow, one of the most successful manga of all time that keeps on giving, no publisher will ever pressure Goda to end it quickly. As for the editors, their job is not to rush publication, but to edit the narrative for better quality. In Goda's case, they are support, not a looming authority telling him what to do. The "5 years" are Oda's own statement, and it was backed up by one of his current editors early this year in an interview, where he stated that he was initially surprised that Oda-sensei had claimed that, but by now he thinks it's a possibility since we were already entering the Onigashima raid at that point. 5-10 years is a realistic estimate, depending on delays and whether he adds more stuff than what he already has planned.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>You're missing the entire point. You *clearly* don't like the EQ/WoW design of quest-driven content. You prefer player sandbox content. What you perceive as the "freedom to explore" and a dangerous world, others might perceive as a stark lack of produced content/story, and bad scaling. Point is, while the two types you're describing are both technically MMOs, they are entirely different subgenres. Therefore it's absolutely absurd to measure AoC against that type, when it makes much more sense to compare it to EQ, WoW, and similar games. We get it, those are not your types of games. But AoC does nothing *wrong* in that subgenre, it's a good representative of that gameplay. You not liking it doesn't make it a fault of the game design. Trust me, there is plenty wrong with AoC without wanting to force it into a comparison it can never win ("it's not the subgenre i enjoy ergo it's shit"). There's also a lot else wrong with your statements (like no other company having had success with the WoW model, which is just flat out wrong....to the level of WoW itself, sure, but plenty of other games have flourished), but it's pretty much all beside the point. I could turn around and go to a LoL sub and make a thread about how "i don't like LoL because it's a bad ARPG compared to Diablo", and that would probably be as appropriate as attempting to compare a quest-based MMORPG like AoC with player sandbox MMOs. You summed it up perfectly in your final paragraph - you like what you like, and others like other things. That's fine and dandy. Don't try to spin it into an objective measure - it's not.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>That's a very bad example to use though, Kitava telegraphs every major attack, and once you've seen them you learn. In fact, most bosses telegraph everything, there are very few that remain dangerous after you suffer your first few whoopsies. Merveil and Brutus are definitely tuned really harshly right now - if one assumes a player is going in there on a 2-link, or with a clearing skill and no single target setup, or without uptodate flasks, no resistances, etc...many players also just don't learn to *move* and keep facetanking and hope to dps stuff down before they die or run out of flasks/portals. There is a big argument to be made for PoE to take more steps to teach new players about a lot of basics, but at the end of the day things like "stop right clicking and move out of that huge attack that's being telegraphed" is a lesson to learn for players by themselves.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>**Age of Conan** Returned to this game after an absence of 6-7 years now. It used to be one of my favourites, it still is. Free to play now, still great straightforward MMORPG content with a unique combat system and great atmosphere. Actually found my old guild still active and recently returning themselves, so quite fun for some casual alt leveling and the odd raid now and then. **Path of Exile** My main game for years now, every league release i try to scrape together as much free time as i can over the first few weeks. Best ARPG on the market, no other competitor comes close. Also one of the best games that are completely free-to-play, an insane amount of content for no money (when you play more you'll want to spend some money on inventory tabs, but you get them for roughly the cost of one monthly MMO sub). **Planetside 2** Still hop in from time to time, great game to just log in, jump into a tank or some other vehicle and have some mindless action. **WoW** Might look into returning for the upcoming expansion. It used to be my main game for over a decade, I've not touched it since late Legion as BfA did not interest me and I was very burned out. Problem is i can't really play WoW casually, i was always a progress raider, but i don't have the schedule for that anymore, neither socially nor professionally, so i'm hesitant to spend money on it when i can't actually spend the time i want to in it.</TEXT>

Next time I played I was in a corp that was trying to dip its toes into some WH exploration while mining in hi and low sec, also got decced. I was really just solo mission-running, experimenting with exploration a bit and set myself goals to skill up to some ships i really wanted to fly, those being Minmatar Battleships. My own sense of progression was that i wanted to get into solo L4 farming with artillery battleships, i kind of reached that point but naturally did not want to venture into lowsec with that kind of fit, my gameplay choices were limited. I never got ganked or jumped personally, and when i did venture into lowsec for some ratting or exploration i flew my cheaper BC or Cruiser fits, so i was prepared to lose stuff. I just don't like the feeling of permanently being in danger when going for more profitable and dangerous PvE, because practically none of that stuff is in Highsec, and even in Hi you apparently can get jumped randomly if you'Re a juicy enough target. So I just stopped before I got too frustrated. I legit enjoy the basic gameplay of just ratting, low level missions and exploration, there were just limits to where i could take it given my unwillingness to take risks.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>AoC was not a WoW clone. The similarities began and ended with the questing system and loot. Countless other games fall into the same niche and were not "WoW clones", they were in the same subgenre. If you want an example for a true WoW "clone", look no further than Rift or SWTOR, who had virtually the exact same combat system, extremely similar talent trees as well as practically all other aspects of the game, simply transplanted into a different story universe. AoC had a completely different combat system and feeling, beginning with combos, physical hitboxes and ending with fatalities and directional defense; the UI and design were not copied over from WoW 1:1 as with previously mentioned examples, etc etc. You say there are "flaws" in the subgenre. I'm telling you it's not a flaw, it's a feature, and you simply *don't like the subgenre*. And that's perfectly fine, you're just unable to express your opinions in an appropriate fashion.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I'm aware, I just don't consider that meaningful progression for myself. I like looking at output numbers, theorycrafting or researching my BiS, having farming/raid/crafting goals to reach long term. Mounts, cosmetics, etc are sidegrades/convenience, it's the cherry on top but it doesn't give me the same sense of satisfaction. If my character isn't advancing in power somehow relative to the content, it doesn't feel as motivating to me (within reason, it doesn't have to be literally endless like D3 Paragon grinding). I played GW2 for quite a while, got through all the original story before expansions and played a good portion of the original playfields. It was fun enough, but there was nothing keeping me there.</TEXT>

Neither is Harvest a compelling "using brains" meta, 99.9% of people simply follow "how-to" guides for a system that is already self-evident, or unintuitive (see mod tags) when not, ergo requires empirical evidence.

After that point it falls off a cliff with extremely repetitive questing and the quality of the storyline similarly declines.

    <TEXT>Others have made the arguments as to why the model in AoC isn't as predatory as many other games are. Although i'm personally more of an interested skeptic when it comes to AoC than a hyped enthusiast, I will have to join in in defense of Intrepid when it comes to the monetization. A cosmetic MTX shop is perfectly fine, it's neither predatory nor manipulative, especially when all purchases are reskins of looks available through gameplay. Look at it this way - the existence of the cash shop is literally saving you 40-60 #8364; while costing you absolutely nothing, anything available on the cash shop (as it stands right now) will be earnable ingame. Win-win, you get the game more cheaply, without there being any pay2win. Other games live *exclusively* off cosmetic and convenience MTX, and are just fine as well. Path of Exile comes to mind. I do not think the mere existence of an ingame shop, period, is an issue to get upset over, the context and details matter.</TEXT>

I'm not going to get upset if a different colouring on a particular skin looks cooler on the ingame shop. If the game is that good that I'm actually ingame and considering the shop, I might just buy cosmetics anyway to support them. At the end of the day the point is that the model being proposed is in no way predatory or pay2win, ergo totally fine. Getting upset over the sheer existence of MTX ingame is not very fair and balanced imo.</TEXT>

As to the server headstarts - I was under the impression that headstarts would be on their own server, and I agree this kind of premium service is a little more questionable. As for cosmetics - I don't really agree, given that in most MMOs for a decade now it's become fairly normal to have vanity armor which displays over your stat gear, optionally. The age of only seeing the "real" stat gear a person wears is looooong gone, and honestly it's not something I'm missing. I get where you're coming from, I played Vanilla too, but it's not a key aspect of gameplay for me.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>What you're referring to is the *paladin* archetype, and it exists in most MMOs in some form. Melee combat with buffs/heals and sometimes the option to fully tank or focus on healing. Rift has multiple support classes fulfilling similar roles. WoW has the classic Paladin obviously, though in that game there is no true "hybrid" anymore, not for a very long time now. All healing classes in Age of Conan actually primarily deal damage while weaving HoTs in and have only very few direct heals for emergencies. The Bear Shaman is a 2h-wielding melee which functions just like that. (AoC is free to play, can check it out).</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I'm not sure why retention is frequently touted as the key metric. While it certainly provides some information about the *general* popularity of a league, it doesn't really say much about the revenue generated. Maybe i'm just hung up on the word "retention", because it implies that it's unique accounts still active in the game, which afaik isn't the number, it's just overall activity. The general playstyle for leagues always has been "play a few weeks, then be done for the most part and take a break", so I would never read too much into unique accounts dropping off after a few weeks. I'd be more interested in week 1-2 activity, revenue etc.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>The two main takeaways for any aspiring writer should be: 1) have a rough beginning, middle and end point for the main character's arcs lined out before diving in. Goda has very clearly always known where this would go, and good writers always have a general outline in mind. This helps prevent one from getting lost and sidetracked in the creative process, especially with good editors, you always want to have a good focus in your story. 2) master the slow burn. Know when to be on-the-nose about something important, and when to casually mention major teases and hide morsels of juicy information. Being able to have a twist or reveal after 400, 500 chapters of a story that was either unpredictable or at least still satisfying, without feeling forced or out of the blue, is an art unto itself. It similarly requires patience and good editing as well as foresight. Two major examples of bad outlining are *Bleach* and *Berserk*. While both suffered from their respective mangaka being burned out and in poor health, the first rushed through an ending arc without a good "slow burn" or satisfying pay-offs, while the latter is stuck in limbo of having way too long to go with an audience frustrated at the sidetracking. I am rather confident that even if something were to happen to Goda at some point (*prays for his safety and health*), he has the ending in detail in notes along with all his ideas, and his team would be able to take over in an emergency.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I've never quite understood why the battle map is still the way it is. Wouldn't it be a way better approach to have only a deployment limit, but no "invisible walls" after that. Instead, units should get some kind of DoT on them if you move *too* far away from the enemy, to avoid excessive cheese and dragging out battles. So basically like a procedurally infinite battlefield based on the tileset, with mechanics in place to ensure a maximum distance limit between forces, instead of artificial boxes that promote camping.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I dunno if you're just selectively reading, but plenty of MMOs get a good rap around here. You can generally assume that most popular MMOs are popular for good reason. So all the genre giants like WoW, FFXIV, ESO, GW2, SWTOR etc are quite good games. The bickering in between is usually just people snarking at each other about which is better, it comes down to pretty tribal bitterness at times. As someone who has played pretty much every Western MMO of rank and file, you can have my personal ranking: 1. World of Warcraft - the king, and it won't ever be toppled from that throne, for good reason. If you want some of the smoothest gameplay and the best PvE endgame content, it's still here in WoW. 2. Age of Conan - this is just my personal ranking, remember. I have a huge soft spot for this game, and while it has a lot of issues, I still love it. Standout feature is the rather unique combat system and the mature atmosphere (blood and gore, fatalities, nudity). 3. The Secret World - hands down the best questing and atmosphere i've ever experienced in an MMO. Has lots of other issues comparable to AoC above (also a Funcom game), but worth it just for that experience. 4. SWTOR - does everything Wow does, just with much more solo story content and in the Star Wars universe. Less/worse raids and endgame content, but servicable. Very fun. 5. Elder Scrolls Online - very little endgame content, but fantastic adventuring, exploring and completionist gameplay, fun stuff like stealing, assassinating, rather unique combat system that kinda works. 6. Guild Wars 2 - very cute world, total completionist theme park MMO, very little endgame, no true gear progression chase 7. EVE Online - this would be way higher up on my ranking if I ever had the time and dedication to push into nullsec space. Differs radically from all other games on this list, not your typical MMO. 8. Rift - basically the blueprint for WoW clones, copied nearly everything into a generic fantasy universe. It's passable. 9. Lord of the Rings Online - aged very poorly, still great story content and loving dedication to the lore, some fun classes, but very poor later content when comparing to the genre leaders Those are the games I enjoyed more or less. Some games that I did *not* enjoy and would not recommend: Star Trek Online - wonky gameplay, really rough visuals and little charm Wildstar - it's dead anyway, but i really disliked the aesthetics Tera - just...why does anyone play this at all FFXIV - passable game, i just really hate the anime style in games All other Asian-style grind MMOs like BDO, Archeage etc - apart from the visual style which I dislike, extremely monotonous, grindy gameplay, barely any endgame content to speak of outside of PvP and grinding. There you have it, that's my personal breakdown.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I've done it all for 12 years, and while reliving Classic for a bit was a fun nostalgia trip, and retail has a lot of "issues", the benefits of the contemporary QoL and quality in design just outweigh the nostalgia trip for me. I had to take a timeout after Legion, never played BfA, but during that time i played a bit of Classic. It was fun for a few weeks, but I quickly came to appreciate the gameplay loops and QoL of retail more. Maybe it's because i've already been through the grinder of Vanilla and TBC in the past, and I have no reason to go through it again, however fulfilling the experience may have been. But nowadays i'm quite happy that I can raid Mythic on a relatively casual schedule, if i so choose, just by virtue of game knowledge and QoL design.</TEXT>

Remember also that people usually tend to vocally engage only when complaining, not to praise. We automatically focus on the negative, when we're having fun we don't generally expend extra energy to state that this is so. FFXIV is not for me, but it's a fine MMO by any standard, and there are good reasons why it is so popular. Don't be swayed by random people on reddit complaining vocally.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I'm not sure if i'll return. I played pretty much from Vanilla throught to the end of Legion, with extensive breaks, usually for other MMOs, during certain "years of patch x" content droughts. I quit when i was pretty burned out with the grind system of Legion, and realized that BfA was doubling down on a lot of these mechanics. In the meantime i've had so many life changes that i can't imagine ever being able to progress-raid again regularly. And playing WoW without being able to participate in proper raiding (Mythic progress) holds no more appeal to me, really. Additionally, it seems like the weekly grind mechanics they introduced with Legion are still around, and that was part of what literally ground me down. So I doubt i will be returning at this point. Too many other games I can play casually and get more out of with the little gaming time I have these days.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Yes, Mythic progress is far too easy in WoW with addons - that's why a shocking percentage of the playerbase always completes the raid on that difficulty while current and not outscaled by new gear/content.... /sarcasm off. I get the issue you may have with too much data and "warning! do this!" indicators on the screen, but for one, this has pretty much *always* been a thing in WoW progress raiding, even in Vanilla. So...i'm not sure what mythical timeline you're referring to where this wasn't the case. Furthermore, these addons do *not* detract from the difficulty of the execution in the slightest, as I said earlier, if that were the case we'd have a *lot* more completion of said content, which we don't. Speaking as a dedicated progress raider in WoW of over 13 years, I can safely say that while I understand the concern you may have in *principle*, you do not actually know what you are talking about when it comes to high end difficulty in WoW raiding.</TEXT>

I have yet to properly look into it because i'm just fucking up to my eyeballs in my free time right now, but I still intend to research the possibility of *anything* flying under EU jurisdiction. My own assumption is similarly that you'd have to stick false advertising or fraud to 'em, and their ToS and the wording in their marketing is very likely covering for that.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Stats to look for: constitution/health - wisdom/magic damage/electrical damage - hit rating/crit rating/critical damage rating - spell penetration When evaluating an item, keep in mind that raw health/magic damage can often be stronger than con/wis on gear, mouse over your stats to see the rough coefficient you're gaining (i believe it's something like 0.3-0.4 magic damage per 1 point of wisdom iirc). Also the most valuable stat to get is generally hit rating, because resisted spells are just flat 0 damage. This principle applies to all damage variants of course. I'm fairly certain hit rating applies to spells as well in AoC, and penetration just lowers/bypasses the resistance of the target, thereby granting more damage. Unfortunately I have yet to find caps for those values, but my lvl 80 casters all hover around roughly 10% hit and never seem to get any resists ever. I'm likely overcapped.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I should add that I've also raided in plenty of games that did *not* have any kind of bossing addons, while still maintaining a comparable level of complexity in the fights, though not quite reaching WoW Mythic levels. It is *not* fun. You're left guessing as to what actually happened, wiping many more times than would be necessary just to sheer lack of information, not lack of ability. When abilities and timers grow more complex, you're stuck having to manually set timers, which is just hilariously awful for gameplay and detracts from things you actually want to deal with, such as paying attention to animations and ground effects. Being left *guessing* and throwing yourself at mechanics over and over with no data feedback as to what is occuring is just flat out unfun.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Your reasoning is ass-backwards. Addons increased in complexity and functionality because the raid encounters grew more complex and challenging. There are usually multiple encounters per contemporary raid tier that *require* addons to successfully progress the encounter, and it doesn't make them *easy*. This isn't about people "not being interested in Mythic", who's "lying" now? If you're as informed as you purport to be, you should know as well as I do that a tiny fragment of the active raiding population, yes even a tiny fragment of the raiders that enter Mythic at all, get anywhere *close* to completing a raid tier before it the next content patch hits. "Why do people have to do this kind of mental gymnastic to avoid facing reality", indeed. Please, by all means - enjoy attempting to progress most modern Mythic encounters without all those nasty addons telling you that player x is linked to player y and needs to separate/be dispelled/move together within 5 secs or your raid wipes. Can you record the raid including comms and send me some popcorn? I really could use some evening entertainment.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I experienced similar issues in Age of Conan and TSW. While those raids were mechanically very simplistic for the most part, there would often be one or two mechanics that were flat out not discernable via the UI or even any particular animation that would just wipe the raid, and you were left trying to guess what was going on. The fact of the matter is that while you *can* design raid fights in an intuitive way that makes them moderately challenging but doable without any kind of UI assistance, there are natural limits to how complex you can scale fights *without* UI aid. The more players raid, the more used they are to mechanics, the harder fights need to become in order to still pose a challenge. Once you've seen a particular mechanic, you need another layer to it to still make it relevant. Hence the constant arms race. Occasionally addons become too sophisticated and trivialize encounters, this is true. However those addons are usually intentionally *broken* by Blizzard within weeks. So there is no ongoing "addons playing for you" in Mythic progress, it's just a laughable notion.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>They're removing one level of RNG, we still have to roll sockets on the gem, which come linked. So by removing one layer, and probably making getting 6s easier than obtaining a 6l now, it *will* be easier to get a fully functional gem. Problem is more that the game will likely be balanced around everyone having multiple 6s, so in the end there will still be quite a bit of orb-spamming involved I imagine. I don't think ppl that don't like rng and orb-rolling should get their hopes up too much for a drastically different game.</TEXT>

Blackbeard, on the other hand, is a rather complex and interesting character. He is allowed weaknesses (cowardice and overconfidence at the same time), but also a relatable motivation in the context of the story. Depending on how the Will of D. story turns out, he may yet end up one of the most compelling antagonists in any manga. So far Oda's pacing with him has been exemplary. We always get enough of the Blackbeards to remind us that they are the endgame, that they are truly the biggest threat waiting for the Strawhats.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Ingame voice chat has mostly disadvantages with very little benefit to implementing it. On the one hand, it's a lot of resource allocation for something that already exists in comfortable 3rd party format, as others have said. On the other, it also poses issues that wouldn't exist otherwise. WoW had ingame vc for a while a few years back, it was pretty terrible qualitywise, and most people didn't even realize it existed. Games like Planetside 2 have voice comms ingame, they work, but things like proximity voice chat are actually a terrible nuisance, bc you'll always get people blasting their techno or whatever until you manage to find and mute them in the proximity list.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>The sweet spot between high quality graphics that measure up to current standards and a stylized, marketable aesthetic that can last many years is very hard to find. Very few studios managed to hit it. The best example of getting it right is probably still WoW. They continually updated it throughout 15 years to the point where it is still immediately recognizable as WoW but holds up to modern standards. Most MMOs with more realistic aesthetics have aged quite poorly. ESO for example looked pretty great on launch, by now it feels a bit tired. The biggest issue is always in the character design. Stylized approaches are much smarter here than entering that uncanny valley territory, i feel.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Assassin is probably one of the rarest classes, it's also one of the hardest to play imo. Herald of Xotli is my overall favourite class, and generally considered one of the strongest for PvP and a strong one in terms of numbers in PvE as well. Easy to play, moderately hard to master. No class is truly "hard" to master imo, potentially Divinity PoM stands out at high levels of play. Easiest classes probably Conqu, Demonologist, they deal really high damage without having to really execute anything challenging. Generally classes that deal a ton of AoE are pretty comfortable to level and easy to learn, the single target kinds that need to watch their pulls and learn their CC (like Assassin, Ranger for example) are a bit harder for beginners probably. Bear Shaman is pretty complex to play as well and doesn't have a lot of AoE either, probably the hardest healer class to play. Most frequent class...dunno, I seem to see a *lot* of Necros and Barbs around always. Both are fine.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>This is pretty much the point. It's not that everyone is a carebear, it's that most of us have experienced how open PvP plays out in practice. Very few games have managed to make it feel fun, imo. Those that have are still relatively niche in appeal and still have vocal groups of the playerbase at odds with the meta (like EVE, for example). Let's get one thing straight: running around with a group or large organization of allies is a lot more fun than getting ganked constantly and fighting overwhelming numbers or unbalanced classes. Most games struggle to avoid that when they allow open PvP everywhere.</TEXT>

This is something that people placing their hopes in AoC as a PvP purist paradise should be aware of. I'm not saying PvE or PvP is the right way to go, or one is better than the other, but the majority of the customer base in this market is *not* the PvP hardcore crowd, and a *lot* of people who participate in these kickstarters and early access, basically the whales who really fund these businesses, are PvE-focused.

Games used to be made with passion and vision and not necessarily because developers thought that this game type would attract the most possible players. " This kind of notion is exactly what I'm referring to. I see a lot of this nostalgia porn and notions of "everything was better in the past". Here's the thing: get excited for a game, discuss it, theorycraft, whatever. But devs *are not your friends* and they are not working for free. The common notion of "all devs are passionate nerds at heart, it's just the vicious corporate suits ruining our industry" is ridiculous. It's when people latch on to marketing and hype babble (just like in a kickstarter) that they start becoming tribal around the studio and project their own hopes and dreams on to ... a game, being produced for profit.

Meanwhile PvE without stat progression is kind of limited to encounter execution, and there are simply limits to how far you can take that. The PvE system in GW2 was muddy from the start anyway without the trinity adherence, and it still doesn't quite work to this day in PvE.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Even though I quit at the end of Legion, skipped BfA, and probably won't be playing SL, WoW is still the reigning and defending champion of PvE endgame, and by a *very* large margin. The complaining and whining on reddit and elsewhere is usually coming from a place of already having played not weeks, not months, but *years* and people getting burned out, tired, frustrated, whatever. That's a genre problem along with addictive behaviour. I personally had to quit due to burnout, the Legion AP and legendary grinding mechanics as well as being "forced" to run content outside of raids every week to be optimal for progress is what really wore me down. Granted I was being completely over-the-top and was like in the top100 on my realm (one of the largest) on AP rankings usually. But it still wore me down. When it became clear that BfA was going down a similar path, I gave up. SL looks to be moderately different in design, but nontheless incorporates the incentive to run M+, other raid difficulties and other content *constantly* for minimal gains. I know myself, it would lead to my doom once again. Thus I will not engage in all likelihood.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>You mean a small studio on the rise will have a different outlook and vibe to it than a massively bloated and successful underling of one of the largest publishers in the world? Well, yeah. Thing is, those smaller studios and dev teams still exist. It's not a sign of the times. And you're kind of deluding yourself if you think game development was ever not focused on maximizing potential revenue with the product. Developers are not artists, and are not your friends. They're working a business, and trying to get the most profit possible out of their work is completely normal. Pretty sure one of the reasons Albion is decently healthy is due to the extremely simplistic graphics and systems. Apples and oranges, really, I don't think it's the PvP element that's truly behind Albion's success, accessibility is. I'm not condoning AGS's actions. If you supported them and are disappointed because you wanted the initially promised iteration, you're right to be upset. But this is not a general issue in the industry or something novel. I kind of suspect somebody over there realized they were never going to make their money back with a pvp sandbox in a high graphical fidelity, a combination of factors which narrows their potential customer base by a *lot*.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>It's pretty much exactly what I always presumed. Frankly, I was always a bit confused as to why people were still speculating about his powers. Imo the way other characters talked about Kaido along with the "Suicide" chapter were pretty on-the-nose. It's exactly like you said, he can't be killed in any conventional way, he is a mythical dragon of good fortune, and I've said so multiple times. It's pretty self-evident by the lore, anything else would be a major surprise imo. Momo being the key may be one way, i'm more prone to believing that BB will show up and end yet another yonkou with his power.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Quit WoW a few years ago after about 12 years in the game due to a variety of reasons. I was pretty burned out, playing way too much, essentially I was in addiction mode and my rl was suffering. Legion's design philosophy had a part in that, too many mandatory weekly activities in order to keep characters relevant for progression raiding. When I saw that BfA was going to go down a very similar path I quit. Now i'm doing quite well irl and able to casually play MMOs and other games, probably won't ever return to WoW though. Other games: GW2 wasn't able to hold me with the lack of PvE endgame and stat progression, though I consider it a great casual MMO. ESO was a similar story, great fun for alting and general exploration and themepark play, just no real hook to keep me in endgame on a character or stick around.</TEXT>

If she's fine with that and/or has other activities she likes to do on her own or with friends in that time, maybe it works out. If she doesn't like it, you'll have to figure it out for yourself. Every couple is different, communication and honesty is important, that's all.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>If you don't enjoy the feel and basic gameplay early on, you're unlikely to enjoy it later on. If you don't enjoy open world pvp, you won't ever enjoy it. If you want instanced endgame and won't get it, there won't ever be anything in the game for you. It will have its crowd that likes it, but usually you can figure out within a good hour's worth of gameplay whether an MMO is for you or not. And frankly, at that point it should have sunk its hooks into you for a good time already.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Rogue individuals, especially in smaller companies? Yeah, it has happened. But on an organized scale, and to the effect that it's the main source of gold and other sellable materials for 3rd party elements? No. The unfortunate fact of the matter is that way more people will risk shady sites and a ban to spend real money on gold or items than would ever admit it. Combine with the rampant botting in practically any game that involves an economy, and you've got your answer. This isn't a new thing and frankly, it's largely under control in most big titles today. It used to be way worse in games like Diablo 2 and WoW has also had phases when botters dominated local economies. So basically, no, the game publishers/developers are not "secretly" manipulating the gold-selling market for 99.9% of the titles out there.</TEXT>

They know they are too early, because apparently the Rio Poneglyph gave them some very specific information. My personal favourite theory is that it was actually written by Luffy in the past, that there are time travel shenanigans incoming, and hence why it's written in such a way that it makes them laugh - also why Shanks cries when told about it ;)</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Just talking purely about the setting here: The planet's name is Terminus. You are one of many survivors of a prisoner transport that has crashlanded here, after strange anomalies in space "sucked" the craft towards the planet. You were originally a prisoner on your way to an unknown sentence, condemned by a galactic Empire. More than that, you struggle to recall, as the same anomalies that have caused the crash seem to have affected the long term memories of all aboard. Survivors are representatives of all sorts of races. As you set out you explore the alien fora and fauna, establish a base of sorts with the former Warden directing efforts through quests. Heavy emphasis on crafting, exploration, with the option of open PvP. Shortly after the intro experience you encounter the dominant local species, as well as their factions, lands, cities, conflicts. Story would focus on the survivors establishing themselves among the local culture and playing their respective roles in the political conflicts, some villains, some heroes. Eventually you could open the setting up by explaining the anomaly surrounding the planet, reintroducing the Empire and other planets (rough idea: Terminus and its inhabitants was sealed off by a mostly evil Empire due to the threat it posed to its ideology and powerbase, the breaking of the anomaly starts off a chain reaction that sees players travel to various other planets and cultures that make up the Empire and contribute to either a revolution, or cracking down on dissent). I'd say a sort of sci-fi/fantasy mix, with space travel and certain futuristic technologies being involved, but mostly medieval/old-fashioned socio-political systems and conflicts. It's a clich #233;, but maybe space travel is only possible thanks to left-behind technology of a Founder race - and there's your next major expansion or chapter with a strengthened Empire or newly established Republic encountering a returning overpowering race.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Likely yes, as while people do enjoy the variety and different choices the game provided over the years, the classic fantasy races will always be exceedingly popular. Case in point would probably be the fact that WoW has...3? 4? different variations of elves now playable in 2020. I'd say a good balance between recognizable and popular racial designs and something fresh and original is probably the sweet spot one should aim for in a new IP.</TEXT>

Nothing more, nothing less.

    <TEXT>For those of you who are still skeptical (as I've seen multiple comments denying this being the plan), Chris confirmed it again during the AMA: https://old.reddit.com/r/Games/comments/im2x1i/ama_im_chris_wilson_from_grinding_gear_games_we/g3wt81l/ Basically, for PoE2 they will decide on what league mechanics to integrate and which to filter out (something they mentioned in one of their talks at ExileCon), and cut down on the bloat, as many of us have expected. Bear this in mind when discussing league content, always ;)</TEXT>

    <TEXT>The live action adaptation has a much bigger hurdle to overcome, and that is to depict the look, abilities and world of OP in a way that doesn't come across as insanely goofy or unintentionally comedic. Many an anime/cartoon adaptation has failed that task. To be fair, most failed to budget constraints, but even those that were not limited in budget scope often made the mistake of trying to translate animation aesthetics and quirks way too literally to live action. To be sucessful, as in a legitimately popular live action Netflix show, they will have to take the risk of taking liberties and *interpreting* the manga/anime into a form that appeals to a live action audience. Another big question is the intended target audience. OP is for teens, and involves violent fights and even murder. They could go quite grimdark with this if they wanted to, though they risk losing the highly unique combination of comedic quirk and thrill of adventure that Oda has nailed so perfectly. It's.... a gigantic task, to put it mildly. The odds are stacked against them. If it turns out even passable and gets more than a season or two, I will be highly impressed.</TEXT>

I brought it up several times in the past and people seemed to disbelieve me, or accuse me of wanting to "dumb down the game". *shrug*</TEXT>

    <TEXT>The fact of the matter is that we have both ends of the spectrum in current WoW, the content is both more accessible and easier than it was (partially due to the playerbase continually evolving as well), while the high end content, both in raiding and nowadays in M+, is harder every expansion, arguably (with notable isolated exceptions, but on average). So basically as with every MMO - whether your money is worth it to you or not is really up to what you make of your experience.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I wouldn't. Because there's nothing wrong with the core tenets of the genre. There's a reason why it became one of the most popular and profitable genres in the industry. People probably need to realize that no game is intended to last for decades or lifetimes, not even a genre. People need to play less, maybe, try other things, and appreciate that too much of a good thing will devalue any gaming experience, no matter how good. Basically, go out and kick a ball or something, come back a few months later, and you'd be surprised how refreshing playing an MMO classic might feel again for a few weeks.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I have more of a suspicion that based on feedback, somebody at Amazon actually took a look at the numbers for pure OwPvP games, and decided that this was not a very good direction to go. I can understand that those who were really hyped up for this aspect felt betrayed, but the cold, hard truth is that the market potential for "pure" PvP MMOs is limited. Op-in for PvP, or separate realms, is the way to go. They probably realized that without solid PvE aspects, the game was doomed to a niche existence. Ironically, their latest preview showed very disappointing and barebones PvE content, and I actually cannot imagine them squeezing in anything satisfying by mid-2021.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I don't see any "hate". I do see a lot of us in the community being extremely *wary* of big promises, and early days hype for projects such as AoC. Just because people are cautious, or not ready to jump aboard the hype bandwagon, doesn't mean they're hating on it. For me personally, i'm quite wary of how zealous the AoC community has already become, with *wild* fantasies of what is to come, and tons of youtubers and streamers trying to hitch their wagons to the hype. We've seen this all before in other projects. This isn't an attack on AoC or Stephen, but personality cults are a bad thing for upholding accountability in companies beholden to pledges, backers, "individual investors" (but without investor power). And this community is displaying some of that already. People get hooked into forming tribes of support for "their" projects of choice, along with the sunk cost fallacy of having already spent money on the game long before release or playability. It doesn't make for an objective or healthy perspective of the project. AoC looks great, and if it all plays out well, it could be a fantastic MMO. We are, however, *years* away from that. We aren't even in a playable Alpha 1 build right now, and a *lot* of basics are being worked on, while a *lot* of advanced systems are simply ideas on paper. Hence why a lot of the gaming/MMORPG community is interested/curious, but going to reserve judgement.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>It's not the only example, but SC is probably the biggest culprit in terms of generating *massive* hype and specifically, maintaining a personality cult based around Chris Roberts to deflect criticism and doubt. It certainly has done a lot of damage to the Kickstarter development platform in general. However they're also still making tons of money (more than ever before apparently), and in the meantime there have also been countless other projects that generated quite a bit of revenue, but never delivered. So the entire "genre" of development is damaged goods right now.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>To add to this, if you've followed game development, whether crowdfunded or regularly backed, in any shape or form for more than a few years - you'll quickly realize that plans and ideas at the stage that AoC is at aren't just *likely* to change, they are almost *destined* to.

I've played thousands of hours of Planetside 2 and while yes, it basically works for large scale encounters, the game has also struggled with performance issues for the average client in those settings for over 6 years. Servers have been *notorious* in PS2 for struggling to keep up, which has been a plague for many more competitive FPS players in that game. Overall, it works, but i wouldn't necessarily call it a feather in one's cap when it comes to attempting battles of that scale in a different engine, with different game mechanics and a wildly different server/sharding system.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>What kind of experience you get in an MMORPG today largely depends on what you seek to make of it, this has not changed from the early days. What many players mean by "it was all better in the golden years of x-x" is usually their own nostalgic fondness for their childhood/teenage experiences. Perfectly relatable, we all have that. However, the genre has not shifted significantly from the original tenets of gameplay. If you wanted to find a dedicated group of likeminded individuals and find your own fun in one of the many MMO worlds out there, you would go about it exactly the same today as you would have in the early 00s. People often conflate the novelty and freshness of the experience they had with the genre with the genre itself devolving or getting "worse" somehow. While there certainly have some objectively bad developments in the business models (cash shops, freemium etc), some fairly bad examples of predatory design and copying of successful competitors, there is plenty of original and engaging design in the genre. To a certain degree, the market is more or less saturated. Newer gaming generations gravitate to faster-paced, more readily accessible games, the entire gaming industry as a whole has shifted its focus towards ever younger demographics. Gone are the days of heady fantasy and roleplaying, gaming is no longer a domain of 15-30 year old boys. There is something lamentable to that, especially in terms of corporations aggressively marketing towards younger kids and trying to bait them into addictive consumption.There are also some benefits and highlights of content production diversifying and growing its appeal. Multiple major MMOs sport subscriber/active player numbers in the multiple millions, the genre is far from "dead". However, the growth bubble has certainly stopped a while ago, and the drive from major investors is going elsewhere.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Except that the mortality rate is roughly ten times higher than any flu strain, it is *much* more virulent and has the potential to develop seasonal strains or mutate more rapidly due to its virulency (read: it spreads more easily than the flu), it has a *much* higher risk of leaving long-lasting adverse health effects than the common flu does, and by not adhering to general safety guidelines but just "keeping healthy and staying away from the elderly", you are in fact endangering others indirectly. Fun fact btw: influenza is similarly weird and actually not understood all that well, as a virus. Small percentages of people who contract will randomly die to it or develop long-lasting health issues. Thing is, influenza doesn't spread nearly as quickly, has a much shorter incubation period, ergo it is more manageable. In fact the common fear of most virologists for decades has been the mutation of an influenza or corona-virus strain to become resistant to antibiotics and more deadly and virulent. Covid-19 ticks a few of those boxes, and has the potential to become even worse than it is right now (which is, again, *much* more dangerous than a regular flu). Check your sources, bias, or assumptions if you believe otherwise. I heavily recommend *only* looking at the actual scientific publications/research journals on the issues, and not having your information fed to you by any form of media, tbh.</TEXT>

But one christmas they decided to send us a plane and a ship that were crafted out of cut up soda cans. Bought at some store of course, not homemade or crafted themselves. Honestly it's not the worst gift ever, but it did cause some bewilderment and led to most of our friends poking fun at us for having gotten literal trash as gifts for a few years.</TEXT>

I still don't a) see this noise here nor b) do I believe that Intrepid would cave like that (they also don't have a major publisher like Amazon leaning on them).

    <TEXT>The one thing people following AoC or pledging to it should be aware of, is that plans are plans. While I don't think the end product of AoC will deviate drastically in terms of design *philosophy*, there is plenty of room for extensive Alpha and Alpha 2 as well as Beta testing to change multiple aspects that are as yet still on the drawing board. In some ways, the combination of elements that make up the concept that is AoC is unique, and untested. I stress the word *elements* here, it's the combination that makes it somewhat new. This also means we don't actually know how this will play out in implementation yet. Does it actually feel as fun to play as the ideas read on paper? Are all aspects feasible in terms of balancing and other concerns relating to technical, social and, let's not forget, fiscal sustainability in the end product? Up until this point and throughout Alpha1 (and possibly 2) is the time to really throw stuff at the wall in terms of feedback, because at later points in the development cycle the ability to significantly alter certain aspects of the game becomes severely limited - without accepting painful delays.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>You're really painting a lot of different games with the same brush, and it doesn't work. But in general, I agree with your stance that older MMORPGs were not necessarily better, and that nostalgia plays a larger role than objective fact in that arena. QoL and ease of access has not lowered the required skill ceiling in most modern MMOs, quite to the contrary the upper echelons of content are far harder than ever before. A lot of players seem to conflate forced time sinks and grinds with difficulty, and in reality most of the original MMO breakthrough titles gated the "hardest" content behind immense grinding and time sinks. The genre and gaming as a whole has moved on in general, challenging players in more ways.</TEXT>

It is true that contemporary MMOs incentivize socialization and organization less, however it's always been an awkward criticism to make that communities are worse because they're not being forced at gunpoint to cooperate anymore.

"0" is a weirdly hyperbolic claim to make. As for their node system claims - it's all "in the works", nothing is in practice right now. That's my point. It's all well and good on paper, it remains to be seen what out of the many, *many* layers that are promised (from player-driven political systems to node battles to guild sieges to instanced pvp etc etc etc) get implemented and actually work out in testing. You already mentioned that several essential basics aren't still in the middle of development, like the rough structure for combat itself. The combination of all these factors in a live environment with feedback from backers/testers thrown in makes it silly to draw any lines in the sand at this point concerning the end result of AoC.

    <TEXT>You seem to arbitrarily classify "proper" as "what I prefer". It's fine and all, but it's a bit silly to claim that no games are focused on open world pvp right now. *Nothing* in the game is actually live and running right now. We're not even in Alpha 1. All i'm telling you is that there are several years of developing, iterating, testing and gathering feedback to go before anything can be truly set in stone for AoC. Your behaviour is part of the problem of kickstarter projects btw. Most of these projects do not, in fact, end up delivering viable end products. As a backer, if you have backed, you are an investor. It would behoove you, if you're invested into the project, to be critical of it and keep an open mind at the same time. Not to defend sand castles and tribalistically defend a company you're interested in. Once again - what i'm saying is that there is nothing concrete right now, just an engine, a build approaching Alpha1 with who knows what implemented out of all the features, and a lot of ideas and concepts.

For optimal DPS Pathfinder is actually superior due to the scaling nature of TR, but it's entirely theoretical and at a point where it's just a question of how many seconds Sirus A8 will survive.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Impale Champion is your better bet for a smooth *overall* starter. The Glacial Hammer Inq build posted is more of a niche one for farming chaos early on. It can scale into endgame, but you'll have a harder time of it compared to a better ascendancy like Champion scaling Impale for melee. Earthshatter is also extremely recommendable.</TEXT>

I've also not had any issues with killing too many guards, i don't try to go for every chest, i open a few, i always open the big extra reward chests, and it's never been an issue. Escapes *can* get dodgy at times, the alert triggered mobs seem to have way higher hp and damage scaling than the regular patrol mobs. But so far i've not failed a single one, and i always do them at level. Only technical issue i've encountered so far was some trap that kept hitting my follower from three screens away, keeping him from opening a door to escape. Fixed it by summoning skellies behind him that got targeted instead :P Golemancer btw.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Seems like they too benefited by the Covid-10 lockdown spending bubble that the gaming industry has a whole has felt. However, that can rubberband to smack them in the face pretty quickly. They've gotten a surge of more donations and interest during the lockdown months, right at a point in time where it's starting to become clear that most of their promises are undeliverable. Combine that with the general tendency of people to dramatize and get enraged about *anything* during these trying times, and it could make for a particularly spicy cocktail in late 2020/early 2021. However, the best bet is for this to just chug along for several more years while gullible dreamers keep throwing money at them, until Calder pulls the plug and sells off the assets.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>- xx million players, one of the major cash cows in the gaming industry worldwide to this day - le reddit: "dead genre" I'm sorry but what? So many people here conflate exponential growth with success. MMORPGs are an extremely stable, profitable branch of gaming to this day. There can be no mention of anything being "dead", it actually makes me laugh. Similarly, how many threads per week do we need from people claiming that the genre was so much better in the late 90s/early 00s when players were forced to grind more and "make their own fun" due to the sheer lack of technical capability in development and hardware? Stop conflating your fond memories with objective evaluations of the state of things. The quality of game production, including MMORPGs, has gone *up*, not down. What you enjoyed doing in 1999 is still possible today (finding people, RPing, exploring worlds etc), just you know - at much higher quality overall.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>It did feel kinda bad, but it also wasn't as harsh as i thought it might be. Without any rogue gear or rolling the contracts, you had to make some decisions, which i thought was ok and a good motivation to invest into planning for your setup. Now i'm not so sure the pay-off system will work, if you don't need to lower alert contributions at *all*, really, you just stack reward items on your rogues and basically...just run the map?</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Yeah I'm not sure whether GGG fucked up by not listening pre-release here, or listening too quickly post-release now. Personally I was highly skeptical of the mechanic, but on live I thought it played out alright. Like, it was easy to avoid lockdown while still getting a few chests, especially the big ones (on a minion build), and it was clear to me that with rogue gear and rolling contracts later on, it would be fine. It basically gave you a goal to work towards with rogue gear and setups. Now that's pretty much removed, so the point of Heist has been reduced to "kill mobs and open free chests", in essence. I think it's fun, but this feels like it'll gut the potential of the mechanic.</TEXT>

I dunno who might be interested in another sequel now, given that the origin of the species is revealed, and it's killed any intrigue or suspense.

    <TEXT>Interested, but highly sceptical. They've promised way too much tbh, and the community is becoming rather cult like at times, which we've seen before in upcoming game communities, especially Kickstarter projects. The game is not even in Alpha1, the majority of lofty systems and goals are concepts on paper, they're still developing basic combat and animations/effects. Yet there are gatekeepers insisting they know *exactly* what the game will be like, and a personality cult has formed around the creator, who is seen as "one of us" despite no playable results having landed yet</TEXT>

    <TEXT>So here's the thing. If you are a content creator - do not hitch your wagon to the success of a game in development. If you aim to make your money by "reporting" on the game, you cannot make yourself dependent on its success. It is a natural bias. Certainly you can make the effort to be aware of that fact, tiptoe along the line. But it's a conflict you should avoid, if you have a conscience. If you are a content consumer - *remember* that many content creators have a vested interest in maintaining the hype and the positivity towards a product they are "covering". It is their brand, their target audience. This will lead to...issues. I wholeheartedly support the notion of constructive criticism, but the community as a whole must not just poo-poo on naysayers and "trolls" who just "hate" the game - it must similarly check itself for a healthy perspective, and avoid turning into a cabal of dedicated cultists, a cycle of content creators depending on the popularity of the project as well as backers falling into their own sunk cost fallacy, having spent too much money and/or time to acknowledge egregious missteps or failures in the project. The latter part of this post effectively encourages viewers to not question, but consume. You should be doing the opposite. If you are heavily interested in a game, follow it objectively and critically. Expect the average, not the best, and be pleasantly surprised when it turns out better. Don't overhype or overshill. If you want this project to stand the test of time, and to become a beacon for Kickstarter done *right*, then checking for balanced views and constructive criticism is the way to go. Part of that would be to immediately drop the "it's all funded already" attitude that a lot of users here have adopted. It doesn't matter how much money has been put forward already. Plenty of people have donated and have sunk costs. There is a backer - creator relationship and responsibility here, keep that in mind.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>You are 100% right. Some of us were, while sceptical of the notion of penalizing killing in an Arpg, quite aware that it served a valuable function. I was quite confused when they rushed to remove it before the vast majority of players could even progress to a point where rogue gear and your choices mattered. Now the mechanic has effectively been culled, the league is quite dead already to me. The potential has been heavily undercut, at least.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>If the common position being taken in this community is true, then no "growth" is needed pre-release. The development is supposedly funded, marketing budget is - i'm sure - included, and the game should sell itself on release, or once it nears a state resembling that. This community can't have it both ways. Either it's "fully funded" and we can all just "lean back and wait for it", or the game needs massive "growth" and hype right now to drive backer package sales etc.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I'm just going to come out and say it - Tenet bombing is likely only partially due to the pandemic. This was the first Nolan flick I was thoroughly disappointed with, and I am a pretty big fan of, really, all of his other movies. This movie had so many issues, it feels like the writers and director got so excited about the potential for "cool" scenes based on the premise, that they forgot the basics of crafting good cinema. The sound mix is *awful*. I thought people were exaggerating about the inaudibility and making memes based on his previous movies, but Tenet is truly incomprehensible at times with mumbled dialogue through masks and helmets, sounds and music overlaying spoken word, etc. The plot is...broken. I won't go into spoilers here, but this did not work on multiple levels, some of them being the technical level of actually delivering the plot coherently, others being core issues with the script itself. Nolan can write the bomb off to the pandemic, but to me this one was a blemish on his record.</TEXT>

    <TITLE>A love letter to Age of Conan</TITLE>
    <DATE>2020-10-06 10:35:43</DATE>
    <TEXT>I think it's time I sing the praises of an MMORPG which, in my humble opinion, gets far too much of a bad reputation, and far too little love. To this day I still log on regularly, and enjoy myself immensely. In the following I will try to break down the basics, as well as the pros and cons (of which there are plenty) of Age of Conan, and introduce it to those of you constantly on the prowl for more MMOs to try, or who have maybe never heard of it. **The History** Now Age of Conan is a Funcom game, the same company who made Secret World, Anarchy Online and the survival-MMO Conan Exiles. It came out in 2008 originally, with much hype and buzz, as it was the first of its kind - an "adult" MMORPG with a big budget and very good graphics at the time, with blood and gore as well as nudity, set in Howard's "Conan" universe. At the time, WoW was reaching unheard of tiers of popularity and revenue in the genre, and competitors were springing from the earth faster than weeds in a vegetable patch. AoC is a classic MMORPG in a fantasy setting, quest-based, instanced, and with comparable mechanics to most other EQ-type MMOs. It sets itself apart with the world, the atmosphere, and a rather unique melee combat system which involves directional arrow combos and hitboxes. AoC's launch was beset with tons of issues. For one, the publishers rushed the launch badly, forcing the studio to cut back on a lot of planned content, and miss out on a ton of bug-fixing. As a result, the game was plagued with technical issues, bugs, glitches, and generally a dearth of content post-intro. While some players fell in love with the world immediately and were able to stick it out, players began to leave in droves after the intro experience of Tortage, as it became apparent that wide stretches of the leveling content were unfinished or untuned in terms of XP. This release is, in part, what contributed to the studio's reputation of having great ideas and designers/devs, but really poor execution and quality control ("Funcom'd"). Originally a subscription-based MMORPG with a box price, it has long since gone free-to-play with a voluntary subscription model, which only becomes more or less required to buy into if one really plans to stick with the game for longer than a week or two. **The Pros:** Age of Conan is a beautiful game still, to this day. Many of the areas, especially the expansion content that was added, are lovingly crafted and designed, and the game is second to none in atmosphere and immersion. If the Howard universe, or more mature and gritty dark fantasy (Lovecraftian elements galore!) are your thing, this game will please you. The soundtrack is timeless and amazing. It's up there in quality with WoW or other movies. My girlfriend usually knows when i'm playing, because she hears me humming along with the music across the flat. The combat is satisfying and engaging. While casters/spells work the same as they would in any tab-targeting game, melee (and ranged with bows) works with directional arrow combos. Positioning and the directional arrow input of your weapon swings matter to how much damage you deal, as mobs have directional shields that react to incoming damage. To top it off, killing blows with combos (AND spells!) have their own unique fatality animations, depending on the class and ability (electrical/fire/cold damage have their own fatalities as well as some class-specific and weapon-specific ones, such as beheadings with 2h swords). This makes for a very fun gameplay experience from the get-go, down to pretty fun min-maxing in endgame. Dungeons and raids are plentiful, and some of the best content in the game. While the majority of dungeons are pretty straightforward and not particularly challenging, the HMs in expansion content and some raid encounters are quite tough, especially for less experienced MMORPG players. The game runs on a typical trinity of tank-healer-dps, however healers deal a lot more damage in Age of Conan, and are not reduced to spamming heals. In fact most heals work in combination with damage setups, are actually heal-over-time effects ( there are very few direct heals and they are to be used strategically!), and pulling off optimal healing can be extremely satisfying and fun in AoC, as it involves more than just mashing a few abilities. Questing/the world: as i already said the world is beautiful. The questing is pretty generic and typical, however it bears mentioning that some areas (especially the intro zone Tortage as well as some key storylines) are actually fully voice-acted. The fact that this stopped to a large degree post-Tortage plays a role in why many players quit thereafter. It's worth sticking with it though! Some of the later questlines, especially in Khitai, the expansion, have fantastic lore and build-up, and a great pay-off in cutscenes in endgame dungeons/raids. Funcom has also added multiple low level areas in patches and an expansion since release, so that nowadays there are plenty of playfields to engage with, as well as quite a lot of leveling dungeons. The game has introduced a raidfinder a few years ago, which enables more casual players to see at least part of the raid content, and gain some gear without committing to a schedule. AoC has some of the more unique classes in the genre. From the Herald of Xotli, a 2h sword-wielding clothie mage who uses melee combos, fire spells and turns into demons, to lightning-wielding or 2h-club swinging healer hybrids, there are a lot of types to try out and experiment with. As an added "feature", FC has introduced an optional "Unconquered" (hardcore) mode, the goal being to not ever die until you reach level 80 - which is quite hard at times (fall damage for example is quite lethal, and it's easy to overpull later on), and makes for a fun solo experience imo. **The Cons:** As I already mentioned, AoC had big technical difficulties and a lack of content to begin with. This was only partially remedied over the years. Obviously resources were allocated elsewhere, eventually, and some things were never fully addressed. So while there are plenty of zones to level up in nowadays, there are still areas the feel rough and unfinished compared to others. There also persist some technical issues to this day, however nothing gamebreaking or frustrating. Age of Conan still has the scars from rushed development, and a lack of resources being focused on the game since 2012. There is an overall "rough" feeling to aspects of the UI, some of the content, and the customer service. For some people, the lack of "polish" in some areas, as well as the noticable lack of resources being allocated to AoC (it is definitely in maintenance mode) will be a dealbreaker, there are no two ways about it. The community is small, but active. There are plenty of guilds to join for raiding or other activities, and the world feels generally populated, thanks to it being just one PvE server nowadays. **Final Thoughts:** I have a soft spot for this game, always have. I do believe, however, that this game deserves more attention even in 2020. For many of those looking for something "like" WoW, but different enough, it scratches exactly that itch, and it isn't yet another Asian anime grind simulator. I encourage you to try it for free if you like immersive MMORPGs with a high level of production quality and fantastic atmosphere. If you are interested but have more questions, feel free to poke me here in the thread, or share your own experiences with the game.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>The PvP side of things was definitely a huge disappointment, from what I've heard. I've personally never engaged in it, outside of a few very fun duels with guildmates. As far as the PvE side of things goes, I feel they nailed it in AoC though. It's one of the few MMOs where I really don't mind redoing content just for the sake of it, just to experience it with some new folks or guildmates. Because it just *feels* good, at least to me.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I'm personally at a loss as to how to approach this. On the one hand, it seems clear that *something* is going very wrong in the development process. We've always forgiven GGG for moderately buggy or rough launches, after a few days it - mostly - got sorted. But it's been getting out of hand, Heist isn't the first league over the past few years that launched in a semi-unplayable to extremely frustrating state. Is it too little testing? Is it too little time between releases? Has the lockdown played a major role in Heist's case? It's very hard to know without more info from them. It's a free game, i'm not going to complain overly much personally, and reward them with MTX purchases every so often when I feel they nailed it. But at some point the alarms need to be going off that this kind of league launch is getting more, and not less, frequent.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>That's not really the case anymore. Khitai faction gear is still great, but with LFR, monthly world bosses and two more raid tiers (T5 is T1 with higher scaling and better stats on gear) and T6 (new raid), the content is spread out. There's also Dragon's Spine for some lvl 85 content, Vanaheim (arguably underwhelming, but still), and Temple of Erlik post Khitai. More recently they added the Onslaught mode, a trial of waves in the Kuctheme (?) temple. Additionally, doing LFR weekly is actually worth it for everybody (and fast), because it gains you shards to get the best rings in the game. PvE balance is somewhat decent, you don't really see anyone stacking one class for anything, every class has its roles, and most encounters require you to have multiple abilities restricted to certain archetypes, so everyone has something to do at some point in a raid, usually. I would add though that the Khitai content is *fantastic* and vast.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I would say so, I returned to the game this year after like 4-5 years away from it. It's free to try in any case, so there's really no barrier to just trying it out. If you enjoy the basic gameplay and atmosphere of the intro experience (which is a solid 10-15 hours for most players I should add), you might consider subbing and playing it all.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>It's free to play for a lot of content, if you really want the full experience, they charge a sub (or you pay for a lot of shop items which is way more expensive). Honestly I think it's a fair model, it's free to play for quite a lot of playtime, and by that time you should have decided if you really want to pay them and continue playing or not. The restrictions on the free mode are quite light, neither the gold restrictions nor playfield limitations really affect you until a few dozen hours into the game. There is no more box price involved, a sub gets you full access to everything, which is a good deal in my opinion, given the quality of Khitai expansion content. It really just boils down to whether one enjoys the game enough to want to continue or not. It also bears mentioning that all of FC's games retain a hardcore group of dedicated players, despite them being very old or having issues. They design good MMOs on the whole. I've often said if FC could just get their schedules, customer service and QA to the level of other companies, they'd be dominating the market.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Well this is something I do mention. The game is in maintenance mode, no major additions or modifications are incoming. To anyone only interested in *growing* games, it will clearly be a dealbreaker. I don't know about FC being a poor company, they've got three very unique and great MMOs under their belt (Anarchy Online, Age of Conan and Secret World). All of them had a lot to offer, all of them had some detractions and issues though. In terms of game design and their dedication to the craft, I rank them very highly. What Funcom always lacked was good quality control, some independence from very harmful publishing arrangements, and better customer service. Those of us who love their content tolerate the rest, because there is nothing outrageously predatory or unplayable about the issues, thankfully.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Agree on the issue being the lack of content after Tortage. That was not *intentional* however, as in a dastardly ploy. They were hard-pressed by their publishers to finally deliver after several delays, and they were forced to make cuts. After that resources got shifted towards the expansion and then Secret Worlds. I think Secret World was amazing in its own right, it too had different issues, but stands the test of time as probably one of the most innovative and immersive single player experiences i've had in an MMO - and probably the only MMO that managed to feel legitimately *creepy* at times. Agree that polish has always been the issue. In AoC's case, enough has been done over the years to make it a vastly superior game than during launch year, though. The Khitai expansion is my single favourite piece of MMO content, ever, hands down.</TEXT>

Heck, for my sub i'm even getting free stuff like legendary mounts that are amazing for playing alts. It's true that FC is a different company now, most if not all of the folks who made AoC have left or got bought out. But the game is still there, the community is active, it has a very fair freemium model, and it's well worth playing for those who have never tried it imo. I feel it's a good thing that it's still around in 2020. Agree that LFR came way, WAY too late. The game has fantastic raids (like Jade Citadel) which 99.9% of the playerbase never got to see pre-LFR.</TEXT>

    <TITLE>Is the quarterly release cycle worth the issues?</TITLE>
    <DATE>2020-10-06 13:26:47</DATE>
    <TEXT>I feel like we've reached a crisis of faith in terms of league releases. We all want this game to succeed, we all love it at its core. But Heist is the cherry on top of a sundae of quite a few massively botched league launches over the last 2-3 years. Apart from us not really knowing how much of a role the pandemic in 2020 has played, we do know that leagues arrive ever buggier and seemingly virtually untested. The question is, is this content cycle still worth it, if leagues launch in such a state that they create negative buzz and potentially drive away players (who could be purchasing more MTX)? What are the conditions here? Does Tencent set the release schedule? Does GGG even have a say? Is there no possibility of more testing - dare I say it, of *public* testing realms/testing events? Not to paint everything black, there are also plenty of leagues that launch well, and the game at its core is better than ever. But it is very sad to see a league with as much potential as Heist has, with so much voice acting and loving detail in it, going effectively to waste in a terrible launch. First impressions are the most important, and these types of league launches cause great damage to the brand of PoE, I feel. Maybe this is just too "inside baseball" in terms of my thinking, and more casual players never even think along those lines. I also don't have access to their internal numbers, or any kind of metrics besides rough estimates of Steam account numbers, to evaluate anything. But this cycle cannot be *good* for the long-term health of the game, or the studio. Are we going to continue this way, or are there exceptional, good reasons for the current state of things? I feel like it's time for an open and constructive discussion here.</TEXT>

I'm not sure what you're referring to with whining players having ruined the game or it going the wrong direction. Do you mean how the game was a lot harsher in beta pre-release? Because i'm not sure that was a good thing. The game was certainly not drastically different pre-release, if that's what you're insinuating. And if you want to play your max level characters and experience the new content then yeah, a sub is kind of required - but also warranted, imo.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>1) f2p mostly limits you in terms of playfields afaik, so you miss out on quite a few zones while leveling and later in endgame. It's not really necessary to decide on that front until well after Tortage though, which for a new player will be a good 10 hours of content to explore (and maybe to try out multiple classes before settling on one) 2) there is a full PvP server with open PvP, PvP zones on both servers, and instanced pvp in arenas, though i'm not sure how active they are 3) Maintenance mode as in there will not be any major updates coming. Rough edges is mostly referring to some zones that feel decidedly rough compared to other, newer ones, and they never went back and redesigned the quest flow etc there. So for example sometimes there will be weird gaps in level brackets. 4) any PC made in the past decade should be able to run it, tbh. The game was high req in 2008 but it's 2020.

Similar to Bab5 in that there were a lot more one-off episodes early on (except that Bab5 did have a long term plan and was planting seeds already). When DS9 does pick up though, it keeps gathering steam. I would highly advise using a viewing guide for the first two seasons and focusing on the few episodes that are critical for specific characters, or start building the long term Bajor/Dominion storylines. Starting with the 3rd season, the parallels to Bab5 will start to become more obvious. By the 6th season, it's an entirely different show compared to season one.</TEXT>

The MMO market is very robust and healthy, dozens of millions of players around the world. In fact, i'd say it's one of the few genres that will last for generations, as entire generations have grown up with it and there will be a sizable audience for that niche for decades to come. It's not exponentially growing as it was from 2006 to 2012 anymore, that much is true. But that's not possible for any genre, or business. It has stabilized, some of the candidates that were not capable of surviving went away, the "strong" survived, some flourished (the "big 5" from WoW downwards for example). The fact that Age of Conan still exists after 12 years despite its absolutely horrific launch speaks volumes, imo.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>The MMO market is typically focused on hooking players long-term, and in that it has been extremely successful. Newer players/generations have been tapped into by more aggressively targeted, short consumption cycle game franchises, but the old MMORPG demographic will continue to be profitable for decades, and remain stable. Once the current generation of AAA MMOs has sufficiently outlived its welcome from a technical/graphical point-of--view, there will be room for new growth/contenders. I'd say probably by 2030 we'll have drastically newer leaders in the MMO genre, but possibly produced by the same familiar faces.</TEXT>

There is a healthy balance to be struck here. I'm fine with deterministic crafting - to a point. Lock the highest tiers, and don't include influence mods. Why? Because you completely invalidate both drops as well as long term chase goals if you include them. This game is supposed to be about getting excited about loot, at its core - not sitting in an item editor for a week until you've ticked off a checklist and can quit the game because you've trivialized all content for the league.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Nice job ascribing something to me personally, especially the evil intentions of wanting to exclude people. The bottom line is some of you simply flat out don't understand how loot-driven ARPGs work, and why you enjoy them to begin with. Devalue loot at the high end, devalue loot across the board - drops will no longer feel exciting, and the main hook to continue playing will simply be gone. This genre is about generating dopamine rushes from exciting drops, it's not a story-driven RPG where it's "one and done", essentially. You've missed the entire point of what you're playing, jumped to accusing people who know and love this genre of being vicious elitists who want to poo-poo on the poor casuals who can't spend 10h a day in the game, and wrapped it all up in a nice portion of entitlement.

This has popped up as early as the advent of Battle.net and Diablo II economies, and will *never* go away.

    <TEXT>It is not an issue in the game design when it is your choice as to whether you want to roll the dice more often for lower chances (as in checking more rares for the occasional valuable roll combo), or filter for fewer items with a higher chance of good value. That being said, they've already discussed that they're planning to reduce loot bloat somewhat come PoE2. As for your decision to quit leagues early due to "lack of ease of access or basic QoL features", I do wonder where this attitude suddenly spawns from when the game has been continually improving for years and leagues on end. Harvest hands players an item editor, and suddenly the basic tenets of ARPG gameplay are an intolerable burden and chore? Curious. As I've said before, there is a case to be made for a moderate form of more determinism vis-a-vis Harvest being in the game. The important distinction is that there needs to be upper echelons of gear *only* obtainable via drop or RNG, else the main drive of ARPG gameplay, loot chasing, goes out the window. A lot of the people vocally insisting on Harvest here are demanding the full spectrum that it provided, and that is a flat out terrible idea for the long-term health of the game. People don't even realize what they are proposing in many ways.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>- Grim Dawn does not really have an economy as far as I'm aware, so the comparison is rather lacking. Obviously you can filter way more if you're playing purely SSF - and you have that same choice in PoE except that items don't drop Ided for the most part so you know...weird comparison - Getting a 6l craft in Harvest wasn't commonplace either, so not sure what point you're trying to make there, as to mapping - welcome to "i can't sustain" in 2020. There are dozens of guides on how to do it properly. Yes it's harder in SSF but - newsflash - while I play in trade I have yet to invest *any* currency into obtaining maps outside of trading Zana to complete my Atlas, ever. So at some point maybe you should reevaluate what you're doing, your lootfilter, whatever. - Speak for yourself I guess? Legitimately the first time I hear anyone bemoan that loot isn't exciting in PoE trade leagues.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I think it's important to keep a balanced perspective here. On the one hand, we all love this game, and we appreciate GGG for historically being a more transparent, approachable developer studio. On the other hand, we are not friends. We are customers and company selling us a product. Maintaining that it's a free product at the base level does not change that dynamic. GGG have built up a lot of goodwill over the years, but it's time to reconsider things after 2020, imo. Whether you like it or not, Covid most definitely played a big role this year, claiming otherwise is frankly absurd. Nontheless the root cause of issues is systemic, and one we've been pointing out and discussing for years, Covid has simply aggravated the issue. The core aim of the 3 month cycle *does*-*not*-*work* in producing satisfactory quality on release, and in fact most leagues are taking longer and longer *post* release to even get into an acceptable state.</TEXT>

To be frank, the game is completely playable without spending a cent for the vast majority of ultra casuals, who never even reach maps. If you're spending more time than that, I think it's warranted for you to be spending some money on them. It's not a charity, after all, and people getting enraged about soft coercion to spend in games like this always amuse me. That being said, i'm not a 100% on board with the premium league tab bloat, which is going overboard, and I view any form of gambling lootboxes critically (even if just for cosmetics), as the danger posed to persons susceptible to addictive behaviour is significant.</TEXT>

    <TITLE>Unconquered - some Tips and Pointers</TITLE>
    <DATE>2020-10-19 10:36:45</DATE>
    <TEXT>So ever since returning to the game, i've been leveling more characters to both try out classes i haven't played yet, and to finally get that lvl 80 Unconquered. My best attempt so far failed at lvl 71 when my PoM took a tumble off a hillside. I decided I would try to compile an overview of the various leveling zones and methods and their "danger levels", as well as some general tips and tricks. GENERAL TIPS: - Obviously, watch your pulls. Especially at higher levels, lots of trash mobs will use stuns and knockbacks, and you can very quickly get overwhelmed if you're not careful. - Have appropriate gear. In some zones, getting decent gear can be a challenge. I *highly* recommend always doing Gateway to Khitai, as it awards plenty of well-rounded gear for each slot for *every* class. If you stick to zones like Wild Lands, Kopshef or Conarch etc, the gear is very poorly itemized (often missing stats like no health/con or no damage/mainstat). After Gateway you should be set until 60ish or so with the odd rare reward from quest chain completions. At 60 I would strongly recommend making or obtaining a set of rare crafted armour with appropriate gems slotted - this ofc depends on where you actually need any, and your class. A Bear Shaman will have fewer survivability worries than a Barb, for instance. But having great gear for your level bracket *always* helps! Don't skimp on damage on gear either, the faster stuff dies - the less damage you take. - Your main concern is awareness, not the mobs themselves. Generally, if pulling properly, playing semi-decently, using pots and bufffood (always!) and having appropriate gear, the usual mobs you encounter while questing in the zones will be mostly harmless. The dangers are environmental hazards and other factors. - FALL DAMAGE IS YOUR GREATEST ENEMY. I cannot stress this enough. Fall damage is absolutely lethal in AoC, even a moderate drop can sometimes kill you - *especially* when, for instance, running in a panic from an overaggo ;) It's also particularly dangerous while mounted, the physics are just wonky. - ENVIRONMENTAL HAZARDS! My current attempt, a lvl 59 Barb, just died while swimming in shark-infested waters in Dead Man's Hand - take note. There are occasionally environmental factors to be aware of. Not paying attention to your breath timer while diving can also be dangerous, as well as some ground effects like the acid pools, also in DMH. - AVOID DUNGEONS AND PUGS. If you really want to get this done, it is recommended to not do any dungeons at all while leveling, and to generally avoid doing any group content, that is unless you are aware of the content you are attempting, and confident in your group. - AVOID ARENA SETTINGS IF UNSURE. Stuff like the Noble District Arena or Ardashir Arena are to be avoided, unless you are dead certain of what you are doing. While the Noble District one is piss easy while at an appropriate level, it is nontheless an encounter you *cannot run from or escape* if anything goes wrong. The Ardashir Arena can be moderately challenging for an inexperienced group, some telegraphed one shot abilities and things to look out for (same as dungeons, really). - WATCH OUT FOR NARROW CORRIDORS AND HALLWAYS/ROOMS. This hasn't happened to me personally yet, but if you've played to 80 once or twice you probably know that AoC can be...glitchy, at times. Whenever you're jumping around obstacles, or fighting in corners and in front of walls/objects, there's a potential for you to get "stuck" into an object from a knockback, for example. As you cannot use the "/stuck" command while in combat, this can potentially kill you. As a rule of thumb, i always try to move a few steps away from any solid objects while in melee range. - Being a subscriber and/or having purchased certain things in the past helps. Massively. Unfortunately, that's how it is, no two ways about it. - Ranged Mages (Demo, Nec) and Healers (BS, ToS, PoM) are probably the strongest candidates to go with. You'd think tanks, but i'd say especially for less experienced or undergeared characters melee is always riskier. I would have managed on my Barb on my recent run, actually, but in general being at range is a benefit. That and the fact that spellcasters just have it very easy while leveling. The PoM was a cakewalk, and would have been the surefire lvl 80 nab for me, if i hadn't fallen down. - Watch your connection. Obviously, bad lags and disconnects can kill you. Nothing much to say about it, if your connection is really poor or unstable i wouldn't attempt Unconquered, you're just setting yourself up for annoyance. Recommended Zones so far: - Tortage (duh, obviously). I recommend the usual path. If you are using XP pots (if you bought Khitai Collector's you have 12h 100% XP pots for instance), i recommend just doing all of Nighttime in one go, clearing every instance as you go, that should comfortably get you to around 20. Alternatively you might want to cycle through the Underbelly and Acheronian Ruins quests, the chain rewards are quite worth it. - Gateway to Khitai. A no-brainer. A much, much better designed zone compared to the release alternatives, with good quest hub flow, good itemization, and it should get you from roughly 25ish to around 40. The repeatable dungeons at the end are decent, prepare by watching some youtube walkthroughs so you don't get surprised by some boss mechanics, and don't overpull, otherwise you should be fine - not mandatory at all, but good bridging XP especially if you're not using pots. - At 40 I recommend the usual mix of Noble District and Field of the Dead, be wary of some potential to get swarmed in FotD. Villas to overcome any gaps. - 50-55(60) Turan. The zone is another newer, and better-designed one. With XP pots will get you to around 60 probably. WARNING: BE WARY OF VARIOUS ENVIRONMENTAL HAZARDS IN DEAD MAN'S HAND (also some boss fights that might be tricky for undergeared characters or low dps/mitigation, i recommend doing DMH only if very comfortable of your character and a bit experienced). - Eiglophian is fine to plug some holes on the way - TRY TO AVOID YMIR's and Atzel's Approach, probably Thunder River too. TR was ok for me, but it does have a lot of places to potentially fall down from - the Pict area can get a bit swarmy and has a dangerous roaming group boss too. - Keshatta is mostly harmless, nice wide open zone, if you're at the right level and properly geared should be safe (i recommend 72+) - Tarantia Commons, classic and pretty safe, watch out for falling off numerous ladders by mistake - Vanaheim: i've only just purchased this and am playing through it on my (now conquered) Barb to see how it is for the next attempt, so far it seems fine but only at Chapter Two. Likely a good alternative to plug in instead of Ymir/Atzel/Thunder (it scales with level and also has repeatable content afaik). Will post more on this when i've fully experienced it. - THE UBER SAFE GRIND: if you really want to make super, 100% sure, you may just want to play Villas every other day on that character (optimally with membership and XP pots), which are very safe (just watch out for wall glitches). Forgotten City and The Breach are other good candidates for repeatable, scaling content that is 100% predictable if you know what you're doing. Vanaheim yet to be tested by me. This method will be slow, and grindy, but very safe over time. Just play the character for a bit every day or every other day. I will add to this list as I go along and encounter more info or make more experiences =) Feel free to chip in.</TEXT>
