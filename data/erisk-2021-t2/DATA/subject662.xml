    <TEXT>I have indeed used a different staff for this design, it was my intention to make it more slim and small (which is why the sphere-thing is much smaller than the original staff). However, I've had in mind about 170ish cm, take or add 5cm.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Oh boy do I have quite the story to share: One day my partner sent me a message telling me she'd like me to help her out in her project, so I went to her place and drove her to a "Studying Cafe" where we'll be working these. Things at first look out pretty good, we sit in the corner on a bench and start working, for some reason I kept dropping stuff and making LOTS of noise, which was especially bad since the cafe was practically like a library with basic fast food and drinks (extremely quite, so each noise was very apparent). After we get to working, I accidentally spilled my pineapple drink on the floor and broke the glass, had to pay for that (didn't have to according to them but it did break because of me, so it is my responsibility, also because I felt guilty for all the noise I was creating). After we finished, we go out to the lounge to pay for the drinks and leave, however whilst I was getting up, I slipped and fell right on my head, making even MORE noise, and making the while floor tiles red with my blood (a small cut on top of my eyebrow because of the fall) (the fall happened because there was some spilled drink that didn't get clean (wasn't visible at the time)). SO, after all that, I just wanted to get the hell out of there, everyone was looking at me wondering if I was drunk. I managed to get up and paid quickly, then was walking to the entrance to get out, that's when it happened, the finale of this series of unfortunate events; my head was smacked hard on a transparent glass door that I had not noticed, sending me to the floor again, opening the wound again, spreading blood again. At this point people were just staring at me creeply, and my partner struggled trying to help me getting me on my feet, I stood up, everyone was staring, had no idea what to do, I waved at them and said "All's my fault, sorry" and I leave quickly. Never ever ever going back there. TL;DR: I go to a silent studying cafe, I make lots of noise, spread lots of blood, fall a couple of times, and awkwardly say farewells with a forehead full of blood.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Hi everyone! First post here, yaay! Now, onto the subject, I've always been a huge fan of old diagrams of machines, gears, tools, weapons..etc, especially when they're on ancient "leather"/"paper". I've seen the diagram that Hiccub had made for the prosthetic tail of Toothless, so I decided I'll make one my own and added to my collection. This one I've had so much fun with, I've used a pencil to draw the basic structure, then a brown/yellow coloured wax pencil and draw the actual thing, then used a 0.5 black ink pen to line it up. After it was done, I used the coloured wax to colour it up a bit more, and then smudged it all together to make it look more blended. (I could've used watercolours, but those weren't at my hand when I made this). I've also used strokes of the pencil here and there, and then smudged it together to create a more charcoal pen feel. (I did want to use actual charcoal pen for that, but it didn't look as good as with pencil smudging.) After everything was drawn and it was finished, it was time to make it look like ancient paper, which is simple, I turned the burner on in my kitchen and slowly and gently placed the paper on top of it, about 5cm high, I'd slowly change the position and the height to get more effects here and there, I also let it burn more on the sides and let the faint flame eat up a bit of the paper. And with that, it's finished! This is the first part of the diagrams, the movie shows multiple other papers along with this, which I plan to make and recreate as well, I'll be posting them whenever I make them. Anyway, hope you like my weird hobby of recreating old fantastical diagrams! :D</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I do like this analysis. To be honest Toothless's actions throughout the movie made me love the movie much more this way, and to be honest, the last part where Toothless doesn't recognize Hiccub is a part that I liked so much, it shows how much time has passed that he somewhat doesn't remember Hiccub easily, but at the same time, once he realized that he is Hiccub, he rushes to play and hug with him. An absolute masterpiece. EDIT: clarity.</TEXT>

    <TITLE>Some questions about the safety and usage of materials.</TITLE>
    <DATE>2019-04-05 17:09:07</DATE>
    <TEXT>Hello everyone! Recently I've been getting invested in the creation of terrains and miniature objects, but I'm completely new to the craft and I have a couple of questions and concerns about some materials. As well as possibly get some tips from people who may have worked on such projects? Thank you in advance. - Most of the terrains I've seen online seem to use pink insulation foam, but I've seen some people say that it is dangerous and unsafe to humans if left exposed, is that true? And if it is, are there measures that I can take to "nullify" the risks? Assuming that it's generally bad to use, are there any other foam types which I could use? (I mostly want to use it for terrain creation and miniature objects such as bridges, houses..etc) - Most of the tutorials I've seen strictly say that I shouldn't use spray bottles on foam as it will melt it, is this on any type of foam? As I personally use spray bottles for 99% of my projects, it'd be better if I can at least coat the final piece with a base colour. - What shouldn't I use on foam? I'm mostly creating the terrain for decoration purposes, so how can I make them last longer and so fourth. - What can I use for liquids for the terrain? E.g. a river. I can't use Risen as for some reason I genuinely can't find a store that sells it here. (Purchasing online is also not an option, unfortunately). I was thinking of using molten silicon (the hot glue with silicon sticks) in large amounts to make the river, would that melt the foam? - Any specific paints that I shouldn't use? Sorry for the long post and the lot of questions, and I'd greatly appreciate any help even if not for all the questions. Thank you in advance!</TEXT>

    <TITLE>Is it possible to make DIY static grass (for tufts and whatnot)?</TITLE>
    <DATE>2019-04-06 16:49:26</DATE>
    <TEXT>Hello everyone! So recently I've been gathering the materials needed to create a terrain for a project of mine, but I've run into a small struggle that, while I *could* possibly live without it, I'd much rather actually use it. Basically, I want to make tufts and static grass of my own to use and apply on the terrain (I already have all the stuff needed for the static grass applicator, except for the actual grass..), however, I've looked locally and it doesn't seem to be available here (at least not where I looked), I can't buy them online either due to some circumstances. So I'm left with pretty much the remaining option (and the option I've followed for 70% of all the terrain materials), which is to make some my own, I've looked online and I can't seem to find a result. So I came for the help of this amazing subreddit, is there any possible way to create static grass at home? with materials that are available locally *in general.* There are those fake grass tiles that you can install at your home, would those work if I cut the grasses from that into smaller thinner pieces? (I know it's tedious, but I'm that desperate, sigh). Any sort of advice is appreciated! Thank you in advance!</TEXT>

    <TITLE>Is this a good laptop? Intended use is some light gaming, drawing, and college. (Budget $600)</TITLE>
    <DATE>2019-05-08 10:43:29</DATE>
    <TEXT>Hello everyone! This is my first post here.Recently I've been looking for a new laptop (as I finally managed to earn and keep enough money for one), currently I own an LG ED530 (Core i3, Intel HD 3000, 6GB RAM), I've owned it for well over 8 years now, and it's still as good as new, not a scratch or a broken button, but I obviously will need something more powerful eventually. So my budget is about $600, and I want to get a new laptop that I'll use for all my tasks (I'm an artist, so I will use it for drawing quite a lot, as well as 3D modelling and rendering for university) , I'm not big on gaming but I would still love to play some games such at GTA V, "New" NFS titles, Minecraft with shaders..etc (I'm fine with medium to low settings at 30FPSish for those). I came across a Lenovo ideapad 330, 1440xHD screen, Core i5 8th gen, Nvidia MX150 2GB, RAM 2GB (upgrade-able, I'll probably get it up to 8GB, I have some spare laptop RAMs that I can use), with a 500GB HDD. It went for about $517, which is well within my budget of $600, but I really don't know much about how good is it and the like, the local shop owner told me it will run most modern games at medium to low, and do fine with the stuff for college, *but there's always the chance that he doesn't know what he is talking about, talking from experience.*  #8203; So in general, I'd like to get a laptop that is powerful enough to run some modern games at a playable FPS, as well as good for other tasks such as drawing and 3D modelling. Is the aforementioned laptop good enough for the price? Or is there something better I can get for around the same price? Thanks in advance, \-Aiden. EDIT: Added the laptop's model (Lenovo Ideapad330)</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I was watching a video the other day about how an astronaut invented a special drinking cup for liquids in space, and that gave me a question that lingered in my brain enough to ask here. Basically, how do soft drinks, like Coke and Pepsi, act in space where there's no gravity? How do the bubbles form and where do they go? Does it pose any dangers? If left opened to the "air" in the space-station, would it become de-carbonated like here on Earth? or will it hold onto the gas in it..etc (I wasn't sure if I should use Astronomy, Physics or Chemistry for this, sorry if I made the wrong call.)</TEXT>

    <TITLE>TIFU by making my dad drink a cupful of kerosene.</TITLE>
    <DATE>2019-05-27 23:02:18</DATE>
    <TEXT>I liked reading fuck ups on this Reddit, and I never wanted to fuck up myself but here I am, with my stupidest fuck up. So this actually happened a couple of weeks ago, everything now is finally calm enough for me to be more relaxed. It all started with a dad  amp; son vacation, we basically take our cars and just drive around the country side, and camp at night, we own a house there so we stop by to put our luggage and all that. I had a small 500ml bottle of kerosene in my bag, (we had an old lamp that uses kerosene, I like the aesthetic and atmosphere it gives, especially when camping), so I, being the idiot that I am, put the bottle riiiight in the middle of the table where we usually have drinking water, (I was taking something out of the luggage, I forgot to put the bottle back after taking the object beneath it) I then go to my room thinking everything is right with the world and nothing is wrong. I was wrong, dead wrong, about 15 minutes later I go to the living room again, and happen to see my dad drinking out of a bottle, my kerosene bottle. I, out of shock, froze in place! I couldn't say nor stop him, I just saw him chugging down the bottle with complete thirst, he didn't notice up until halfway through the bottle, he looked at it with the most terrified way and said "WHAT IS THIS?" him yelling snapped me back into action, and I told him while panicking that it's kerosene. I instantly take him to the hospital in my car and he had a stomach cleansing procedure, (is that's what they're called in English?), he had the worst days of the week of vomit, burning butthole, and stomach pain. All in all, it's been a couple of weeks since the incident and I'm terrified and super guilty about what had happened, and that if there was one more wrong step my dad would've been dead. TL;DR: I leave a kerosense bottle out in the open, dad mistakes it for water, lots of burning butthole complains immerge. EDIT: To those saying there's no way he didn't notice the smell, I fully agree, my mother pretty much went crazy on how he missed the strong smell of kerosene. Although according to my dad, he was dead thirsty when he saw it, he was working on cutting wood/logs just before and didn't think through. He did notice after a chug or two that it's kerosene, I never said he drank the entire thing, only about 150ml-ish at most, his body instantly wanted to vomit but he wasn't able to, nor did the doctors suggest it as it may enter his respiratory system, which is deadly.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>So far he is much better, the doctors said there's nothing to worry about, the kerosense fortunately did not enter his lungs at all! So that's good. And according to him, he was immensely thirsty, he just chugged it instantly, as he was cutting logs for the camp fire just before.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>He did only drink a mouthful-ish, I never said he drank the entire thing, I do agree that I was dumb enough in this situation, very dumb actually. But my dad did want to vomit almost instantly, the doctors urged against it on the phone (before we take him to the hospital) as it may enter his lungs, which is much worse than simply being in his stomach. But to be honest I myself don't really see how he didn't notice the smell, according to him he was dead thirsty, so I suppose it's a fuck up both on my side and his.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Considering the average wage here in Syria is roughly $60-$80 a month, I'd say living here is really annoying. Sure house rent here, food and stuff are "cheap" to first world countries, but to us it's not. I currently work 9 hours a day everyday except Friday. And earn about $60 (considering the rising currency exchange, our wages are getting even less in dollar terms. What used to be 1 dollar = 50 SYP, now it's 1 dollar = 630 SYP. And it's on the rise.) My rent, bills, and university eat up roughly all my paycheck. (I literally end up with only $5-$10 each month that I can spend on food.. rent is $40, bills $10, uni is $500 a year. I can't count the many times I had an empty wallet each month I can't even afford a single noodle pack.) Unless you study something to be a dentist, a surgeon or anything medical related, you can't earn much at all. And to actually study that you need to pay over $2000 in education for two years for a BAC degree and get nothing less than 230 in the final grading out of 240, and I studied extremely hard and actually managed to pay for the education (sold my car that I inherited) and I only got 214.9/240, where did that land me? English Literature.. education is probably the third most shitty problem here, finding a job is 2nd, and getting money in general is first. Prosperous? Maybe to first world countries I would agree. But in Syria it's simply not the case. Like, I haven't paid rent in three months because of a fine I got that ate up all my savings, and I have no idea how I'm going to pay rent or what to say to the landlord next week.. But my case is actually average, I know people who have it even worse..sigh 6am till 4pm uni, 5pm till 2am work, 2am till 3-4am studying, and only about 2-3 hours of sleep. And I'm not even studying something that has a bright future, so it's only natural that people like me in this country feel depressed and suicidal, God knows how many times I've attempted suicide but only stopped due to fear of pain.. Sorry for the little rant, just wanted to get this off my chest, my life has been going down the hill recently</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Part 1: Nobody remembers exactly when it started; the fog that suddenly engulfed all of Earth, a couple of generations already passed by since it occured, and people adapted to the short horizon lifestyle. At first people raged in a fit of confusion and fear at what happened, but overtime it simmered down and people who still throw fits are generally ignored. Some of them say they see large black oval shaped things moving without breaking the silence within the fog, others say they hear throbbing sounds at night, that's when the fog usually gets thicker, but most people simply live on their lives normally. I work for a shipping company, taking products from factories to markets. It's my shift today and I've currently been driving my truck for a couple of hours, and there's still a couple more till I reach my destination, but it's a nice calm drive so I'm enjoying it, other than that, it's nothing special. I decided to stop for a bit and sleep as I was getting pretty tired, it's 2am and it's been quite a long time since I've been driving so it shouldn't hurt to relax a bit. --  #8220;Huh..? #8221; I wake up to find my shivering, sweating, but at the same time I felt extremely cold, I felt dizzy and lightheaded, I tried to turn the heater on but just before I could reach it I felt a sudden rush of fright, extremely bright lights suddenly shine through the fog before me with a loud buzzing sound following after, giving me a pit feeling in a stomach, I felt even colder, I barely could process anything and my brain was firing with adrenaline. Then the lights started moving towards me, I felt enormous weight on my chest with every second passing as the lights got closer, and closer, and closer, and closer. When suddenly, with a loud almost robotic like sound  #8220;You in the truck, step out of the vehicle #8221; I felt my chest squeezing itself out of fright, I barely could move a muscle. But I mustered up enough energy and opened the door of the truck, got down and was now standing in front of the bright lights.  #8220;Turn around, on your knees, hands behind your back #8221; the voice says, I do as prompted, I got my hands tied and I was taken into the lights, in what seemed like a vehicle. I entered it and sat on a bench, as the doors of the vehicle closed, the bright lights dispersed and I can see more clearly now; a cabin, with a person wearing an astronaut-like suit, and guns, lots of guns, next to me is a cube like object with a small screen in the middle, the cube made a sound the same as the one from before, this loud robotic sound  #8220;How did you get here? What do you think you're doing stepping into this territory? #8221; the cube says, in an interrogation-like style. I stare, confused and startled, I try to utter a word or two but nothing comes out. I was still shocked.  #8220;Well whether you tell us or not, we'll have to take you in, you better be able to explain yourself once we're there #8221; the astronaut-suit person speaks this time, but with a surprisingly feminine voice. But that doesn't matter, I manage to speak a few words to them, hoping to understand the situation;  #8220;Uh, I'm not really sure what's going on, I was just driving to get the shipment load to the market. I went to sleep after I parked the truck and suddenly this happens #8221;  #8220;Uh huh, I see, well, once we reach our destination, you can explain yourself there #8221;. Trying to get out of this seems impossible, so I just went with it. I managed to take a breather but I was still very much on guard and panicking from the inside. I've had no idea of where were we or where we're going, the vehicle I'm in had no windows from where I am, and it's nothing but silence outside. It continued like this for 20 minutes, until we came to a stop.  #8220;Let's go #8221; the astronaut person took me outside the vehicle and went into an underground area, the door which we went through closed, and pipes pumping gas suddenly went on, then the other door opened and, even though I was hand tied under seemingly imminent danger, I still was amazed at what I saw, massive city like structure extended well towards underground, pillars stretching from the top to the seemingly bottomless bottom,buildings exist almost like a reverse city skyline, and for the first time in my life, the fog doesn't seem to have trickled here, my field of view stretched so much more forwards, this place was definitely massive, this experience was new to me and I found myself profounded at what I'm seeing. But it didn't last very long, as fright and cold suddenly hit again when we entered a room that felt eerie. I was told to take a seat and wait. After a while a woman comes in, short back hair with blue eyes, she was dressed pretty well and gave a rich flair to herself. She proceeds to take a seat in front of me and speaks  #8220;Do you know why you're here? #8221; In a voice that I've heard before, wait, is this the same astronaut person that was with me?  #8220;Uhm.. no not really, like I said I was driving my truck- #8221;  #8220;Yes yes, that part I know, but what I'm confused about is how did you get into this high security territory slipping under all our radars and suddenly popping in the middle. Do you mayhaps know how? #8221;  #8220;Wait what, I was driving on Rockport lane, I've driven through it plenty of times! #8221; She looks confused at me, and seems tired of me as if I was lying.  #8220;Well, you're currently in Palmont City, more specifically in the Carbon Canyon area, so I'm pretty sure you weren't on Rockport lane, so if you're trying to slip this by me just stop, or you'll not like the consequences #8221; Palmont City? I've never even heard of this, what's going on? I'm getting more confused by the minute, But my train of thoughts gets interrupted by her saying  #8220;Well we won't be getting anywhere like this, do you have an ID? #8221;  #8220;Uh yeah, here #8221; I give her my ID and she goes out of the room for a while, then she gets back  #8220;Well, Mr.Callahan, looks like this is an issue. Don't worry, looking into your records and checking our radar logs and cameras, I think it's safe to say you're innocent. But here comes a problem. How can I explain this, actually, follow me #8221; She says, as she gestures for me to go out and follow her, I feel a bit relaxed that I'm not under the wrong idea here but I'm even more confused by the fact she says there's a problem, but regardless, I follow her.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Part 2: We go outside the room back to the platform where I saw the view of the whole underground skyline, we take an elevator and go down hundreds of floors, during the descend, I can't emphasize how much the fog had actually affected my perception, I can see so much further here and I feel much more, well, free. The city with it's neons and blue and yellow lights just looks straight out of a movie, crowded yet very well put, that continued to bewilder me until we reach our destination, no longer was the vast open skyline in front of my view, but a small narrow corridor that seems to lead into a door at the end. I follow the woman until we reach the door, she opens it up and we enter through, in front of me was what seemed like a round table, with many figures sitting in the chairs surrounding the table, they all looked at me in silence and it made me very nervous.  #8220;Well gentleman #8221; the woman says  #8220;This is Mr.Callahan, I've already explained the situation to you, but it seems it's inevitable that we need to explain it to him. #8221; I take a seat and look around, I feel very out of place in this rather luxurious space. Thoughts interrupted by one of the gentleman sitting, with him saying  #8220;Mr.Callahan, we think we know how you got here, even though we really don't want to drag more people here, I'm afraid we have to do an exception for you. As what Doctor Emma had already said to you, we are now to explain what happened, Doctor Emma, if you please #8221; The woman who took me in, Doctor Emma, got up and started explaining to me what is going on  #8220;Well, let me ask you first, Mr.Callahan, what do you know about the fog that took over Earth a couple of generations ago? #8221;  #8220;Uh, not much, aside from it getting thicker at night, and that it suddenly happened without a warning #8221;  #8220;Well, you see, around 50 years ago, the fog came from small oval shaped ships that appeared all over the world, we consider this as our first alien interaction, though we haven't actually seen them, we have confirmed that there are living creatures within the ships. They spread the fog around the world causing massive outbreaks and protests, people considering it an attack of some kind and they were scared of it. But after it simmered down, most people simply got used to it, believing there's no harm to the fog or well, to anything of it really. Since nothing else happened aside from the fog. Here, you are in the most safe secret bunker of all the world, away from the fog and everything else. #8221;  #8220;Oh, I see.. I suppose that's how it started, but uhm, isn't the fog harmless? I don't really see why we would have a bunker if it does no harm. #8221;  #8220;That's correct, except that the fog isn't harmless, that's simply what it seems. The aliens, after spreading the fog, they started lurking within it and taking in humans what we assume they are using them for, nutrition. #8221;  #8220;Wait what? Well that seems like nonsense mind you, there haven't ever been a case like that, and the fog has been here for 50+ years! #8221;  #8220;That is correct as well, there aren't any cases about it. That's because the fog isn't just any fog. After years of experimenting, we were able to conclude that the fog, when inhaled, gives the person some sort of memory loss, so you don't know cases of that because you and everyone else who is inhaling the fog has their memories altered every time something like that happens. Someone disappears into the fog? It also disappears from your memory. Which is also why the bunker is a safe place, we pump clear air here and get rid of the fog if it gets in, so they can't get here, nor do we inhale and forget stuff #8221;  #8220;... #8221; I sat there, dumbfounded and shocked, I couldn't process what she was saying, that doesn't make sense, but.. I don't even know what to think anymore  #8220;But #8221; I say,  #8220;That doesn't explain why I got here? #8221;  #8220;Well that's simply because they probably chose you for the next dinner, they can translocate you to any other point in the fog, and then take you. But it seems we were quicker than them this time haha #8221;  #8220;Wait.. so, I was going to be eaten? #8221;  #8220;And forgotten #8221;  #8220;Wait wait wait so, all those rumours about things lurking in the fog, the throbbing sounds and the oval shapes, they're real!? #8221;  #8220;Obviously, yes #8221; I'm in shock, I don't know what to say anymore, I feel overwhelmed and stressed out, my heart is racing and I'm sweating furiously, I was clearly panicking  #8220;Anyway #8221; Doctor Emma says,  #8220;I'm sure this is too much to handle, so why don't you go and take a breather, we can talk again whenever you feel ready. There's so much to discuss #8221;  #8220;I.. I'll take you up on that offer #8221; And with this, I took my leaving and was shown to my room, I was still panicking and I wasn't even able to bother looking at my surroundings, I simply jumped to the bed and put the pillow above my head, and ended the night trying to wrap my head around all the overwhelming information I just got.</TEXT>
