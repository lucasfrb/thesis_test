    <TITLE>Something Odd in The Items Screen</TITLE>
    <DATE>2015-11-07 05:06:10</DATE>
    <TEXT>Hey guys. I just wanted to point out something I noticed. In the Items screen, if you look at The Quarter, there is text in the bottom left saying "x10", and another saying "x4" underneath it. With the Quarter, that makes 1000 cents. If you look at infamous number 109 Money=Power, there is a message in the bottom left that says "where are you". While its completely possible its just Edmund trolling, I think it basically confirms another secret character, likely through Greed mode. I think it means to have 999 cents in the Greed Machine, and with one in hand and Money=Power, something will happen. I'd try it, but I don't have the time, and its now harder to donate much in Greed mode, so if anyone can confirm or deny this, or if they could say if they also see these messages, it'd be much appreciated. Anyways, thank you for reading my first post! I hope that no one has talked about this yet, but I couldn't find one.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Oh man, Braid would be fantastic! (Though FEZ is a close second!) My favourite memory of gaming is back when I was around 5 years old. We had a Super Nintendo, and my favourite game was always Tetris Attack (weird, I know). My dad would always have his friends over, and I'd play against them, almost always beating them single-handedly. They might have been losing on purpose or just not have known what was happening, but my dad got a real kick out of it! It was tradition for any guests to play against me once just to see if they could beat me. Nowadays, I still play occasionally, but now it's pretty insane what I can pull off, it's just so satisfying to play. It's probably my favourite non-Steam game, and it holds a special place in my heart. My Steam ID is [here.](http://steamcommunity.com/id/nickmorash) Thank you for hosting this giveaway!</TEXT>

    <TITLE>How to have one keyboard work across several inputs?</TITLE>
    <DATE>2018-03-21 06:20:40</DATE>
    <TEXT>Hi there. I have a full PC and a laptop wired to a single monitor (one via HDMI, the other DisplayPort), and I can switch between the two on the monitor no problem, but obviously my keyboard only works for whichever it is plugged into. I know I can swap between the two whenever I #8217;m switching tasks, but I #8217;d really like to keep it in one location, as it is also one with two USBs and a headphone jack. The monitor itself also has one USB, on it #8217;s side, which makes cabling there a pain, not to mention the lack of a second USB. I #8217;m not super great on money so if there #8217;s a specific cord for this specific problem, hopefully it isn #8217;t too much, otherwise if there #8217;s some workaround, or if I can somehow hook the laptop up to the computer, please let me know! I #8217;m fairly new at this, so I don #8217;t know a ton. Thanks!</TEXT>

    <DATE>2018-05-08 23:57:54</DATE>
    <TEXT>Hey there, I'm considering buying one of the two headsets here, but I have a couple of questions about them. -The Tiamat uses 5 audio cables, but I only have 4 ports (missing side surround); can anyone note how much of a difference this will make? -Is there any/much difference in sound/mic/comfort quality between these headsets? -Do either headset break easily or don't stretch? My head is a little larger and has broken headsets in the past. -Do the wires from the Tiamat get in the way often? -Considering I don't have the side surround, is the Tiamat worth the extra money? -I'm hurting a little for cash, is there a good deal out there now, or can a sale be predicted in the future? Sorry for all of the questions, I just want to be sure I get the right headset at the right time. Thank you for any and all help!</TEXT>

    <TEXT>A  #8220;friend #8221; in our group wanted to seem cool and do her own thing by saying she had a boyfriend for a couple of years. She #8217;d talk about him once in a while, and make him sound like the greatest person. He was  #8220;away #8221; on a service trip when we were all getting together. Asked for a photo of him, and she got defensive. Eventually she did show him to us, but I wasn #8217;t there, so I asked for the photo (someone said he looked like a friend of ours), again she got defensive, but eventually sent it, apologizing. Fast forward a couple weeks, and something struck my as off about the picture. Reverse image google search, and boom, the 6th image (at the time) when you look up  #8220;guy on a date #8221;. Called her on it, her story changed and she struggled to keep it intact (saying she was just embarrassed of how he looked, that she wanted to impress us, that he doesn #8217;t like taking photos, she just didn #8217;t have any, etc). It #8217;s crazy that someone you know and trust for years can just keep up a lie like that and go with it for so long. And hey, if you #8217;re going to do it, at least pick a hard picture to find.</TEXT>

    <TITLE>Have a key affect a different window when pressed?</TITLE>
    <DATE>2018-07-03 19:41:19</DATE>
    <TEXT>Hi there. I'm looking for some way to have a different window be affected when a press a key. The reason for this is that I run two applications, one for main use and the other for background music (it's not an actual music app, so I can't just have a play key work). In this case, I want just the left/right arrows to take action in the other window, preferably without opening the second application, and not alt-tabbing as the first application freezes a bit when doing so. I've tried using macros but I have no idea how to do what I want, or if it's even possible. Last note, I'm using a single monitor, so I can't just have one on each screen. Any help is appreciated, thanks!</TEXT>

    <TITLE>My positive experience with Razer Support (really!)</TITLE>
    <DATE>2018-08-24 21:47:45</DATE>
    <TEXT>So recently, my old Deathadder Chroma went out (or, kind of. It was starting to get unresponsive despite it working near perfectly up to the hour prior to the issue). I had no idea what the issue was, so I contacted support live, trying to see what may be the issue. Standard questions, try resetting, try cleaning, try a different computer, etc. where all of which didn #8217;t do anything. He then asked about my warranty on it, which I was sure was either out or out very soon (it didn #8217;t show up on my registered list so I assumed the former). He took a look, and said that it seems I was in luck, that it was still fine and almost expired (pretty sure it wasn #8217;t, but ok great!), but since they didn #8217;t have the Chroma in stock, they #8217;d upgrade to an Elite for no extra charge! I just thought, fantastic! I went through the RMA, returned it, and two weeks later received my Elite! (I was sent the Overwatch version, which looks slightly different, but since everything else in my setup is black, I asked to swap to the normal Elite, and support agreed to do that too, received the normal Elite about another week later.) I know a lot of people have issues with Razer support (I know I #8217;ve had minor complaints when asking about other things), but after this experience, I just can #8217;t be mad about it!</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I had bought one from their site a while back. While you can still do some basic flips (simple openings), the weight is much lighter than a real knife since it #8217;s wooden, so it #8217;s not the best specifically to practice on. But it does look really nice in person, and it didn #8217;t get held at the border, so it #8217;s a nice little display piece for the price.</TEXT>

    <TITLE>Storage Unit Changes</TITLE>
    <DATE>2019-11-23 02:30:21</DATE>
    <TEXT>I #8217;m a big fan of what #8217;s happening with the storage units, and the ability to sort things within them is much appreciated. But there are two things I #8217;d really like to see adjusted with them. 1. The ability to store Genuine pins and event coins. I know this is a niche change, but being unable to store them just doesn #8217;t make sense. The support page states that default weapons can #8217;t be stored, but it doesn #8217;t say anything about pins and coins being unable to be stored. 2. Placing things in the unit should place them in the order of actually depositing, and retrieving items from the case should place them in your main inventory in the order of retrieval. I don #8217;t know why they keep items in the order of acquisition, I just want a way to order my play skins without having to place them on the market, or trading them to an alternate account. There #8217;s not much of a reason not to let user #8217;s order their items, especially with a new sorting option in the way of the unit. I still really like this update, but I don #8217;t understand why we can #8217;t just sort our inventory normally. I know I #8217;m in the minority on this, but it #8217;s just my two cents.</TEXT>

Being a part of a big group mentality doesn #8217;t bring about an unpopular opinion, it #8217;s still a common opinion. Likewise, a post defending her (which I #8217;ve also seen on Reddit, but wouldn #8217;t gain as much traction because it #8217;s of the opposite hive mind, obviously) also wouldn #8217;t be an unpopular opinion, just that it struck the wrong side of the argument.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>To go with what I tried to describe earlier (unfortunately politics are the easiest way I can think to describe), there are lots of people pro-Trump, and lots anti-Trump. Go to a group who #8217;s pro-Trump. Saying  #8220;Trump is good #8221; would be popular. Saying  #8220;Trump is bad #8221; would be unpopular. On the other hand, for those anti-Trump, the opposite would be true about those statements. Therefore, neither individual statement would really be unpopular, it would just have a different reaction from different groups. It #8217;s nothing really controversial or ground-breaking. It #8217;s the same situation in this case. So, it #8217;s no surprise going to a place, such as Twitter, where people follow Cardi B, and saying  #8220;Cardi B is bad #8221; would typically result in poor reception, and on Reddit you #8217;d expect the opposite.</TEXT>

    <TITLE>Steam just removed items from my inventory entirely?</TITLE>
    <DATE>2020-01-03 03:48:26</DATE>
    <TEXT>I had a number of items from games where their entire purpose was to just decorate your profile page via the item showcase. In the past a couple items were set to be non-marketable, as well as unable to be set on my profile. It's annoying, but I still have the item (and could trade it if I wanted to). However, a few items which weren't prevented from being displayed (and I received before the other one was locked out) are now entirely out of my inventory, not just locked. If I remember correctly they were still marketable, and were selling at a few bucks each (I paid maybe $5 between three items maybe ~9 months ago). Can they really just remove them from existence entirely without any kind of warning? If they locked them like the other one I have I would still be upset, but understand they don't want to effectively sell "profile icons" on the market.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>The items I #8217;m missing are those sort of  #8220;profile icons #8221; that a lot of people use in their item showcases to decorate their profile page. I #8217;m unsure if these sort of items aren #8217;t really allowed or whatnot, but I see them fairly frequently, and a bunch of people on my friends list display similar ones on their profile without issue. So did I, for the past 6-9 months or so, until now that they #8217;re removed. I know I wasn #8217;t hijacked or anything like that, it #8217;s not an issue. The game they came from was removed from the store, but obviously people that owned the game still have it, and it #8217;s community hub (while pretty dead) is still there. I have a similar item from another game which was also removed, yet I still have the item (mind you, it #8217;s market-locked, and can #8217;t be displayed now, so mostly useless at this point). These other items though are totally gone. I #8217;ve tried to look into a little more since I posted, and it seems as though the creator of the game had another similar one, where a number of the items infringed copyright (seems like logos were the biggest issue), so they removed that game #8217;s items; probably removing these as well due to the same creator, despite these ones being less obvious copyright and more in the grey-area (text, generic images/characters,  #8220;fan art? #8221;, etc.). I know depictions of people aren #8217;t much of an issue in these items, a number of people on my friends list have rappers/celebrities in their item showcase. One discussion mentioned this has happened to other games in the past, but after enough complaints and further looking into it, they undid the item removal. I #8217;ve contacted support to just show my concern about it, and seeing if they could return the non-copyright-based items, or possibly even refund the credit I used to purchase them on the Community Market way back. Considering it #8217;s Steam Support I don #8217;t hold out a lot of hope, but you never know. Either way, no sign of  #8220;these are going to be removed #8221;, or even a notice saying that they were deleted (and why would #8217;ve made things a lot easier) would #8217;ve been much appreciated, and while I understand they #8217;re just trying to be safe legally-speaking, to some extent it was unnecessary. Sorry for the essay, lol.</TEXT>

What #8217;s some good advice for me at this point? Should I be saving stars for an event I don #8217;t know of or just buy 10 play bundles whenever I can? What #8217;s a good way to boost my power outside of levelling up and training my members/using area items that affect them? Does skill training always take a lot of tickets/repeat members? And is farming Veteran room+ the best way to get enough shards for each member #8217;s second episode?

    <TEXT>As the other user replied, it #8217;s way more dependant on your band power and it #8217;s members #8217; skills. Even if one player does considerably better, the higher power/better skills will almost always perform better. It #8217;s much less dependant on combo especially when compared to other rhythm games (osu! Is a popular example that comes to mind), which sometimes seems a bit unfair but it #8217;s just how the game functions. Makes the VS Live feel like less than a VS, though. And thank you!</TEXT>

    <TEXT>It #8217;s not strictly about how many 4-stars, you can do really well with 3-stars as well, it #8217;s more about finding a combination of similar band members and type bonuses to work with your area items. I #8217;m rank 117 myself after playing a couple of weeks, and have 5 4-stars currently, but my highest scoring team only uses 2 of them. There #8217;s a great resource called Bestdori where you can make an account and enter which cards you have, and it will find the best high-scoring teams you can currently make, even considering their skills and your unlocked area items. If you have the time I #8217;d recommend it. Don #8217;t feel too bad about not having max area items, at the end of the day the extra couple percent probably won #8217;t make a big difference unless you #8217;re reallllly going for high scores or EX missions; for VS Live it likely won #8217;t change much either. I will concede though, at your rank having no 4-stars seems really unlucky (I got 2 in my first two ten-pulls), and if you haven #8217;t, you should save whatever you can for the DreamFes in just a couple days for the doubled pull rates. And the  #8220;matching with your power level #8221; is definitely a bit of a stretch, especially considering most matches are already determined just based on each player #8217;s band power and skills. I #8217;m probably not the best at explaining these things since I #8217;m also new and learning as I go, but to my knowledge this should all be right.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Fair enough. My friends and I play late Office matches a fair bit. We #8217;re all Nova 1-3, and I #8217;d say 60% of the time we match against full silver/unranked teams, 30% against MGs or higher (we #8217;ve played against a team with a Global, 2 Supremes, and 2 LEMs, fun times), and 10% on-rank, or similarly ranked teams. About a month ago, I had a 24-win streak without ranking up, simply due to only finding silver games, it was absurd. With the trust factor update, it #8217;s been like this for months. It #8217;s annoying sometimes, but we #8217;re just playing for fun, so it #8217;s alright.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Should preface that I'm talking in CAD, but background here: https://steamcommunity.com/market/listings/753/420110-Chocola%20%26%20Vanilla%20Getting%20Ready Still, a pretty sizable drop, since now you can craft it for cheap if you own the game, albeit an untradable version. However, people that want it as their primary background won't care if it's untradable, so there's that.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>It's not all bad in my opinion, even though it looks like I lost roughly $20-30 in value in community items. Crafted ones are untradable, and can only be crafted by owners of the game. I still think value overall will go down, but it could bounce back somewhat, depending on demand. The trading card change is a bit of a weird one for sure. I could understand the one-a-day if it was a permanent feature, but it's not in this case (and probably for good reason, really cheap trading cards can break profile xp, though probably not as bad as last summer, lol), but one-a-day for the event is a weird choice. Maybe it's just to prevent more cheap xp, and putting a small premium on the event badge levels. Can't say for sure, though.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Depending on the map/when you play, this can be very common. Myself and my friends are all Nova 3, and nearly half of our matches are against either full silver teams, or teams of MG+, we #8217;ve even been up against globals. This is mostly due to us playing a small map pool and playing late every day, so we go up against the same groups occasionally. This has been happening since mm has prioritized trust factor more, so at least we #8217;ve seen fewer cheaters.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>https://imgur.com/a/3G6JwB0 Picked this up this Kirino figure from a local seller at a good price, I think it looks legitimate but I'd like a second opinion. Sorry for the mediocre photo quality. None of the molding/painting looks off (compared to both the real photos, as well as other bootlegs I've come across), but as the figure appears as though it was never opened (the seller said as such), and if it's legit I'd like to keep it unopened for now, I'm not looking to take it out to get a really close look/better pictures, sorry.

    <TEXT>It's very hard to tell for sure, and it was an older ad so I haven't heard back yet (which is expected), but someone's asking a killer price for a Taiga figure since the box is mangled. I don't even know if the seller will ship to me, but if anyone can tell if this is legit or not (even though the picture is fairly bad), it would be super helpful. The seller also stated all parts are included, the box is just decked. Based on the box and price, though, I'm expecting the worst.
