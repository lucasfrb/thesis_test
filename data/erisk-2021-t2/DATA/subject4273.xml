    <TITLE>Book(s) to read while I wait for the next Keeper of The Lost cities books.</TITLE>
    <DATE>2019-05-25 05:11:20</DATE>
    <TEXT>There are a lot of books I could read now, and a lot of books I've started, but none of them really have that hook. There are some books that just reel you in. These books are the kind of books you binge read, even if you could be doing all sorts of other things. The kind of books that you think about all the time when you aren't reading them. I just finished the latest keeper of the lost cities book after rereading the entire series, and now that I'm done, I'm dealing with what almost seems like withdrawal. I'm so bored, and I just want to pick something up and be sucked in. I'm not into any specific genre, but I prefer young adult fiction. (I don't care about the age demographic that much, I'm just not here to read Dr.Suess, and I'm also not here to read Moby dick) I will say that I'm usually more interested in stories that have a lot of world building in them. While I'm fine with NSFW, I am not interested in sappy romance, or Literotica. Are there any good books that've hooked you? Suggestions?</TEXT>

    <TEXT>So, I've been rehearsing for my school's talent show. I used to be really well known for singing at my school, but it got stressful and stopped being fun so I practically dropped off the face of the Earth and a lot of people don't even know I can sing.I really wanted to do the talent show to blow a bunch of people out of the water, and because it sounded really fun. I'm singing The Ballad of Mona Lisa. The songs not too different, but it is if you're trying to fill a gymnasium with sound. I'd mainly been having trouble with the highest note, and the high part at the very ending. I was able to do it, but it was difficult, and it usually sounded forced or shaky. Today I was practicing and I don't really know what I did, but it had something to do with my abdomen, and suddenly those parts sounded effortless (they weren't) and I felt so happy. I didn't really have anybody to share my victory with, but I honestly feel so relieved, and I thought I'd post it here. Hopefully the talent show goes well...</TEXT>

    <TITLE>Any advice for a first time modder?</TITLE>
    <DATE>2019-10-01 03:31:21</DATE>
    <TEXT>I've modded stardew valley before and dabbled in those sort of things, but that's about it. I'm working towards a pretty ambitious goal, of making a modpack with about 30 mods, and making a server with the modpack so that I can play the pack with my friends. This may not seem like a lot, but keep in mind it too me over an hour to download optifine, and the only real mod experience I have is through one modpack I got off technic launcher and played for a day. I have very little idea what I'm doing and it's all a little overwhelming, so any advice you guys can give me is greatly appreciated. Also, can I make a server with a moddrop modpack, or is it simply better to use technic launcher? I have both, it's just that technic launcher is more intimidating. I'm not asking for a tutorial or anything, but do you guys have any tips for a noob?</TEXT>

    <TEXT>My friend is planning on eating a Crayola crayon in a few days. The crayon is new, in clean packaging. She knows that they're non-toxic, but she wants to be absolutely sure that if she eats an entire crayon, nothing bad will happen to her. She will obviously be peeling off the paper before eating. She doesn't mind if she has some slight stomach discomfort or anything, but she'd like to avoid illness and permanent damage. If it turns out to be unsafe to eat a Crayola, can you recommend a safer brand of crayon?</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Physically, it's hygiene. I don't care how tall you are, how strong you are, how nice you are, how much of an amazing person you are, if you smell really bad all the time or your hair looks like it hasn't been washed in a month, it's going to be really hard for me to be around you. Obviously your smell is from a condition beyond your control, that's a different story. Basically, not bathing is the problem. If you can't take showers regularly because you're homeless you get a pass. If you have access to a shower, please use it at least every other day. Personally wise, if this person makes fun of other people or is super judgemental and closed minded, we're going to have a problem.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>The whole thing is that a lot of FTM trans people (female to male) may be on hormones, but still get their periods because they haven't had a sex change operation. It can potentially cause dysphoria to buy pads marketed to women. By acknowledging that men can get periods too, trans men will feel validated and are more likely to buy those period products. It's good marketing.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>There have been records if gender dysphoria since ancient Rome, though it wasn't called that then of course. I think a lot of people in the past have had dysphoria, but it wasn't talked about so they never knew what was "wrong" with them, so they lived out their lives feeling like a stranger to themselves. There might be other alternatives to dysphoria in the future, but I don't think transition is a bad one. It seems like a pretty decent "fix".</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Yeah, no problem. It's true that we don't know the long-term effects of transition. I don't think there's a very good alternative atm though, because dysphoria doesn't get better even after a long time. I think transition is generally the way to go, though it is pretty expensive, so it'd be good if there were cheaper alternatives.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Fun fact, sneezing is occasionally what triggers the start of a period cycle. I'm not saying it's what makes the period happen, but say you're due to start your period soon.

Unless it's a very nice or really cool unique teddy bear, I'd recommend getting a more exotic animal. Maybe a stuffed chameleon or a tiny llama or something.

    <TEXT>I mean, it's not super important to have someone mature. What it comes down to is whether or not they're at least as mature as me. Guy in their adolescence are generally less mature than girls their age. This isn't a sexist thing, it is real and it has to do with hormones. It all evens out by adulthood. Chances are, it's going to be difficult to relate to a guy who is my age and average maturity for his age, which is often why you'll see highschool girls dating a guy a year or two older than them. The thing you have to be careful about is being mature vs being serious. I have a very silly side, and a completely no-nonsense guy doesn't interest me.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Honestly, finding good books can be amazing. Go to your school library, and check out a book. Read at least 40 pages of the book before you decide if you dislike it. If you don't like it. Check out another book the next day. Repeat until you find a good book. Once you finish the book, do the whole process again. I know reading can be a drag, but seriously, if you find a good book, it can pass so much time. Also, it doesn't really matter what you read, when you read, you get smarter. You retain lots of information and stimulate areas of your brain that maybe don't get a lot of use. I'm not saying you'll be Einstein, but you'll genuinely get smarter. Also, maybe try and plant a seed in a little pot and take care of it every day. Then get more seeds, and more pots, and you can have your own little garden world. Maybe try to get down the basics of another language. Also, if you need book recommendations, I gotchu</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I mean, it has a lot to do with what's culturally acceptable. Guys are just used to the whole, don't show emotion thing, even if it's not a conscious decision. On the other end of the spectrum, girls are indirectly encouraged to be more emotional from TV and books and stuff like that. It's not even a sexism or stereotype thing necessarily, at this point it's kind of just what we're used to. Also, around puberty, because of the difference in hormones, boys tend to get overly angry in frustrating situations, whereas girls tend to cry in frustrating situations. It's not always the case, but it is pretty accurate. It's just hormones.</TEXT>

You won't see those imperfections because you only look at the photo for a bit, and the same can be said for when other people look at your photos.

For now, if I start thinking of dying, I put myself in the mindset of, "considering how much I hate living, if I died it wouldn't be the worst thing, but I can die later. Right now I have too much shit to get done to worry myself with something I have such little control over; and that's how I plan I dying, by an external force. I will not be the one to pull the trigger." I don't always mean it, but it keeps me moving forward.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I have depression, so I kind of do want to die. But here are some reasons that I don't. 1. I actually have people that care about me, and I know that dying would probably be the most hurtful thing I could ever do to them. 2. I'm to lazy and too much of a wimp to do the deed myself. I can die later, it'll happen eventually, so I might as well keep doing my thing until that happens 3. I'm miserable now, but I'm pretty young, so I have this strange hope that maybe the future will be better. I have amazing grades so I could probably go to just about any college, and I might as well see what that's like I guess.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I'm in highschool, and I sleep with two animals. I might add pictures if I have time. The first and oldest is named (yes this is it's whole name): Baby Poohdie Baby Blanket Smelly Pants Strawberry Ears Woppy the Fifth Silly Happy Stinky Bear Vaughan. It collected names as I aged through early childhood. It's a Classic Pooh Baby Blanket. Basically imagine a tiny green blanket with the torso of a brown Pooh bear holding onto a clump of ut. My mother got it and like 6 other identical versions at her baby shower before I was born. I reached a certain age in development as an infant where I was able to tell them all apart, and that's when I singled out Pooh (That's his nickname so I don't have to say the whole thing) as the favorite. That thing has survived me getting sick as a child and blowing my nose into it, the time when I was 3 and cut lots of holes in stuff, 2 chewed off noses, and years of abuse. It has a rattle sound that I'm able to distinguish, and I'm pretty sure I've imprinted on the sound so well, if I heard it anywhere in the world at any point in my life, I would immediately recognize it. The other one has a less interesting name: Mr. Bear. It's one of those weighted, herb infused plushies that you can heat up or cool you down to help you fall asleep. It's not the drugstore variety though, it's really high end and I got it when I was 8 and I went to Colorado. Even though I didn't have it when I was a baby, for some reason I still sleep with it every night. It's absolutely fascinating the connections humans can form with objects. These animals have been with me through so much, before my bubble popped and I couldn't just be a kid anymore...While my grandpa was in the hospital all the time...Through years or emotional abuse and neglect...Through all of the crushes... Through the trying years or middle school...My struggles with self harm... The 3 of us have been through some shit. I can sleep just fine without them, but why would I if they bring me so much comfort?</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Honestly, I'm too young to even go through a pregnancy. I'm technically able to get pregnant, but I weigh under 110 pounds, and carrying a child for 9 months would be absolutely terrible for my body, and the baby, considering I'm already iron deficient and I probably don't eat enough. I'd have to stop doing aerial silks and theater and all of the fun things I do for the duration of the pregnancy. I'd probably have to undergo a C-section because of my age and the fact that my mom had to have one. Plus, even though we live in a more accepting world, people still talk, and I'd have to live with this all through highschool. I'm usually a big fan of adoption, and if I was like 21+ years old there's a chance that's what I'd choose, but right now abortion is the only reasonable adoption for me.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Personally I think PC is better than mobile, because it gets updates the fastest, and you can mod it if you get bored. It's also really nice to have a mouse, it makes certain tasks a lot easier. I also really like that I can be playing stardew on my computer, and then just tab over to Google chrome and look something up on the wiki before returning to the game. As far as multiplayer goes, it seems like most people have it on PC and Switch, (my two favorite platforms) but I don't hear a lot about mobile mutliplayer. I honestly don't even know if mobile has multiplayer  #175;\_( #12484;)_/ #175;</TEXT>

    <TEXT>The fastest way to make money in the beginning is fishing. Upgrade your rod asap, and sell most of the fish you get.You can use the algae and seaweed you fish up to get more energy. The farther you cast your line, and the more you perfect the fish, the higher quality they are and the more they sell for. It's hard to start, but I promise you will get better at fishing and start raking in the dough. As far as bundles, I'd make sure you completed spring foraging, spring crops, and don't forget to get five gold parsnips for the quality crops bundle. It takes a year to complete quality crops, but you'll need to get started asap. The pantry is so important because then you can unlock the greenhouse. The most lucrative crop is green beans, but potatoes are also nice. You won't start making big bucks off of farming until blueberries in the summer, but if you want to farm stuff those two are what I recommend. Also, this isn't a must, but having farm animals gives you a passive income that's surprisingly profitable and comes in really handy down the road. Try to go mining at least once a week so you aren't short on ores.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I'm not very self conscious about it, but that's mainly because my mom is naturally a size G (you read that right) and it has caused her lots of back pain, she can't run that well, and she can't always find clothes that fit her. I take after my grandmother on my dad's side, so I don't have to worry about getting that big, but seeing how overrated it is makes me feel alright with being an A cup. I've got a couple more years to develop, and I predict I'll be in the b-c range, which is fine to me. It helps that I'm kind of going for a cute, petite aesthetic, and a smaller chest is good in that case. Also I do aerial silks, and similar to ballet and gymnastics, smaller is better.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I see this happening especially with Anxiety. It's almost become an aesthetic, with hot topic buttons saying stuff like "my anxiety has anxiety." I'm in highschool and if you mention anxiety in most of my classes, a majority of the girls (I'm not trying to stereotype, this is just an observation I've made) will be like, "yass, relatable, me toooo." We're all just teens, so hopefully as they mature a bit they'll change, but right now it's just so obnoxious. I get anxiety and uncomfortable in certain situations, but so do most people, I don't have anxiety and I'm fine with saying that.</TEXT>

I'm super active in r/inceltears and such, because I'm curious about them, and the thing I've realized is that most incels are guys who were either neglected, or have some sort of trauma, and ended up spiraling and curdling into something really nasty. Loneliness can do that to a person. There are definitely a lot of scary incels that talk about how rape should be legal and promote violence and stuff, but it seems like so many incels could just really use a hug.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>While I will say that people on the sub tend to get butthurt about stupid shit, the reason the sub was made was so that girls who didn't feel like they fit in at r/teenagers would have a place to go. It's not a feminism subreddit, and most of the feminazi stuff comes from a very loud minority. The original philosophy of feminism is that men and women are equal. That has been skewed a lot by now, but there is nothing wrong with feminism at it's core. My personal opinion on feminism is that we shouldn't use labels to define our views, because labels are easy to misinterpret.</TEXT>

    <TITLE>I'm looking for anything people might know about Indonesian politics surrounding immigration to Indonesia, as well as Indonesia's stance on Uyghur Muslims in China. (Model UN)</TITLE>
    <DATE>2020-01-06 21:15:01</DATE>
    <TEXT>Hello, I'm a high school student from the US, and I'm participating in something called a Model United Nations. It's where highschoolers come together to simulate what would happen in a real United Nations Conference. Students are given different countries to represent, and attend committee discussions around real world topics. I've been chosen to represent Indonesia on the Human Rights committee. One of my requirements is that I write two position papers from the point of view of the Indonesian government. Each paper needs to be on a different agenda topic, and there are four agenda topics for me to choose from (Euthanasia, Treatment of Detained Immigrants, Algorithmic Discrimination, and Uyghur Muslims in China). I've tentatively chosen to write about detained immigrants and Uyghur Muslims, because I know that Indonesia has tensions with China, and I figure I can write a decent paper about immigration. The issue is, I've been able to find almost nothing about how Indonesia treats its immigrants, or their views on immigration around the world. Any information helps, thanks.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Hello, I'm 32. The number thirty two gives off an aura or purity. I believe that pure numbers are numbers that are either even with and even amount of digits, or odd with an odd amount of digits. My number has angelic biblical roots, is the boiling point of water in Fahrenheit, and is the atomic number of germanium. In chess, 32 is the number of white squares on the board, black squares on the board, and the total number of chess pieces in a starting game. 32 is one of the powers of two, and is present in the game 2048. Edit: for some reason my number is now 34. I don't know how this has happened, but I feel like my life has been a lie.</TEXT>

I'm pretty rowdy and tomboyish, so I relate to a lot of the things on the guys side, and I feel really unincluded. I'm not saying everyone needs to be included all of the time, but there's a reason why r/teenagers has so few girls and r/feemagers is so popular with girls...

    <TEXT>This study is a data set that was taken from a dating site, and it is only accurate for short term encounters and hookups, not actual relationships. Plus, dating sites aren't the real world. The reason it seems like there are more attractive girls then there are attractive men, is because girls have been evolving to be more subjectively attractive. [Sauce](https://mobile.abc.net.au/news/2009-07-29/evolution-makes-women-more-attractive/1371676?pfmredir=sm) I know there are bitchy women, who only want guys that are 6 feet tall and make lots of money, but that isn't most women. Those women are loud, and noticable, and they make the rest of us look bad. The reason a lot of guys can't get girlfriends in highschool is because most highschool relationships are shallow, and a lot of girls just want a boyfriend for the clout, so she's going to try and find someone who'll look good in her selfies. This is not a reflection of how dating works. Highschool is shallow, and you cannot say you have an understanding of dating from highschool experience.</TEXT>

If you're looking to hook up with someone, you're probably going to try to get with the most attractive person, but if you're looking for a long term commitment, you're going to factor in things like personality and similar interests. It's very closed minded of you to assume girls only care about sex or money. There are plenty of people who have no interest in casual sex, even in 2020.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>The best place to find prismatic shards is skull cavern. I know it's difficult to progress in in skull cavern without a certain sword that you may or may not need a prismatic shard to obtain, but get the best weapons and food you can, eat a lucky lunch on a good luck day, and grind in there a bit. You'll probably die a few times, but I've seen some people's skull cavern hauls and they've ended up with like seven shards. You probably won't get that many, but you'll get at least one eventually. Unless you're really bad at mining like me. I live a relatively shard free life, and I'm coping okay.</TEXT>

One thing that isn't always apparent though is how deep the characters stories already are. The dialogue as well as the cutscenes reveals a ton of information about even minor characters. For example, Jodi has a surprisingly sad backstory (I won't go into detail, you can talk to her yourself :)  #8203; While I think there are a sufficient amount of cutscenes for the villagers, I'd still be really happy if there were more, and Concernedape is probably already planning more cutscenes and dialogue options for future updates.</TEXT>

You can earn well over 1000 per day with a basic chicken coop and some mayo machines, and up to 8k a day from fishing in the mountain lake in spring, and the ocean every other season. That's how I rack up cash. For future reference, I also recomend starting up blueberries as soon as possible in the summer.</TEXT>

I feel like an 8 year-old whenever I open the app. I've been playing it for 3 years and not gonna lie, my wardrobe is pretty great. Fair warning, they are always encouraging you to buy stuff, but you totally don't need to, to enjoy the game. I will admit I've spent 99 #162; The thing is, in order to beat levels, the key factors are the clothing traits, the amount of accessories you wear (and their traits), how many Momo tip items you wear, and how the clothes fit the theme. What the outfit actually looks like doesn't factor in at all, so most of the time your winning outfit looks absolutely horrific...</TEXT>

We always have my favorite granola and a giant tub of plain Greek yogurt, frozen strawberries and peanut butter power for my smoothies, and peanut butter for my toast and sandwiches. There's also always eggs, sourdough bread, raisin Bran, apples, bananas, and cheeses of various types. For quick meals, my parents have egglant parmesans in the freezer, and I have frozen chicken pita pockets. Nothing is really off limits, because I'm not that into junk food anyways. We don't buy soda unless I'm going to have a bunch of friends over, but I don't ask for it on normal occasions anyways.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I learned about them from my mom and in school, but I didn't care much. Then, I saw a Safia Nygaard Video on YouTube where she tried out a menstrual cup. I love her videos, so seeing her try out a cup made it look appealing to me, especially because the video was unsponsored, but she still ended up liking it. I especially like that it's environmental, and that you can leave it in for so much longer than a tampon.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I've told my mom I'm pan before, and she doesn't care, even she doesn't completely understand it. My dad and I haven't talked about it much, I have a very strained relationship with him, but I'd assume that while he acts like he thinks everyone is equal, he has a subconscious bias, like he does with race. If I brought home a black guy, I don't think he'd be against it, but he'd be skeptical, so it'd probably be similar if I brought home a girl. Also my mom has told me that it's not a good idea to come out to him, unless I start dating a girl. So yeah, if I came out to him, he probably wouldn't be the biggest fan, but he wouldn't punish me.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Today wasn't the greatest day, but it was at least eventful. I got up, and because I knew I had strenuous exercise after school, I made myself a hefty breakfast, and tea for my mom who is currently sick. I went to school, which was okay today. I'm painting a mural in my ceramics classroom with my friend, but she was sick today, so it was pretty boring. I have chemistry (the class) with the guy I like, but he was also sick, so it was pretty boring. Apparently my councilor thinks it would be a good idea to take the SAT this year even though I'm a freshman, because if how many grades I skipped in math. I am not looking forward to studying for that... After school my dad picked me up and he needed to go to the bank. I sat next to him while he chewed out this woman for some error somebody made up the chain. He kept saying how he had over half a million dollars in accounts and it would be a shame if the bank lost our business. He visibly ruined her day. I whispered sorry to her on the way out, but I couldn't do anything about it, so I left with my dad and pretended nothing had happened. He's like that with my mom and I too, so it's nothing new for me. Luckily he's been in a good mood with me lately. When I graduate I'm going off to some high flying college, and I won't have to see him ever again if I don't feel like it. He then drove me to my circus class (I do aerial silks) and it was an exciting but exhausting 90 minutes. I got home, made my mom some cucumber, and tried my best to clean up the kitchen. My dad has my mom do the chores since he's the breadwinner, and now that she's sick the house is starting to get more cluttered. I cleaned up the kitchen as best I could so it would look clean enough that he doesn't make me do the dishes. I despise doing the dishes almost as much as I despise my father, lol. I'm probably going to whip up some exciting concoction for dinner since I'm responsible for my own meal with my mom sick. Now it's homework time, which as boring as it is, is a pretty calming thing for me. If I get it done fast, I'll play stardew valley with my friends tonight, but that probably won't happen because I'm pretty inefficient XD TL;DR: My family is super dysfunctional and my life basically centers around school at this point.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Yeah, people these days are self-diagnosing themselves with mental illnesses just for kicks. Just because you get stressed out doesn't mean you have anxiety. Just because you like things a certain way doesn't mean you have OCD. Anxiety is not your aesthetic, it's a debilitating mental illness. Romanticising mental illnesses downplays their seriousness, and the next thing you know, kids with the same illnesses y'all have been glorifying are seen as freaks when they show what the illness actually looks like.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>14 year old girl here, welcome to my world. I've been hit up by all types. Thirsty/lonely teens, creepy "roleplayers," a DDLG guy (not to kinkshame, ageplay is perfectly fine if both people are over 18), etc. Then there's the people who say they've created a private subreddit meant to be a safe space for teen girls, asking if you want to join. This is a setup, the want photo verification. Not necessarily nudes, but they still end up with photos of underage girls. And the person that messages you from out of nowhere asking you if you want a gay friend. This is a setup; they want you to get comfortable around them because you think they won't see you that way. They probably won't try for nudes from you, but if they can steer the conversation to clothing they can try for some pretty promiscuous photos under the guise of giving you clothing advice, etc. Just today, somebody messaged me out of the blue asking me if somebody approached me in a park and offered me $100 to flash him, would I do it. If you say yes to this, they'll probably say they're willing to pay you to flash them. The way you can tell right away that these people are predators is that they usually have NSFW accounts, with no posts, comments, or karma. It's an icky world. Stay safe y'all.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>The biggest thing to remember about this is that sugar is way worse than fat. The food industry loves to make "healthy", low-fat foods, but the thing is, foods with less fat don't taste great, so they pump them with sugar. Even 0 calorie sweeteners are bad for you, so don't let that fool you. One thing I'd recommend is eating a breakfast that is absolutely filled with fiber. It takes a long time to digest, so it'll leave you feeling full and energized for longer. I also agree with lots of other comments in this thread. When you're teenaged you start to loose the lankyiness you had as a kid, it's a natural, hormonal thing. You're metabolic is fine, and 130 isn't too bad for someone who's 5'3. That being said, you know your body, so if you think you should loose weight, make sure to eat healthy, not diet. There's a difference. Also, be wary about stomach insecurities. Most media Photoshops women's stomachs to be flatter or smaller, but the fact is women have more organs in their lower body, so their stomach will stick out to a degree.</TEXT>

My frugal ass considers even a $5 purchase to be a huge one when it comes to mobile games and such, but because I'm stuck inside playing love Nikki more, I figured I might as well. I never payed for recharges or anything before this, and the only reason I got to V4 was because I had bought I couple of the mega discount time limit packs. But now, I'm actually considering spending $15 to get the first two lucky bags when they drop. I think it depends on your circumstance. Some people have tighter wallets right now, understandably so, but I think it gets balanced out by people who are playing the game more now.</TEXT>

    <TITLE>What are some good suits to craft if I want to farm maiden chapters for clovers?</TITLE>
    <DATE>2020-04-20 23:16:18</DATE>
    <TEXT>I want to farm maiden chapters for clovers, so I figured I might as well complete some suits as well. There are plenty of basic suits that I probably haven't completed, because though I've been playing for over a year, I only recently got my shit together. Now that I've got my act together, I'm working my way through the chapters as fast as I can, but I'm still only on chapter 7 because I keep keep getting stopped by clothing requirements that involve princess farming.  #8203; Can anybody thing of some crafting suits that require a lot of earlier-chapter maiden drops?  #8203; Edit: I'll start compiling a list of good suits to farm for\~ Credit to the users in the comments. * My Personal Favorite: Bath in Starry Sky. It doesn't require much gold or star coins to craft * There you need a lot of Pearl Hairpins to craft Silver Feather, so you might as well farm them now. * Deer Elf only needs maiden drops to craft. Warning, it does require a lot of gold. * Pearl Hairpins, Bonetooth Necklaces (Ch3-2), and Studded Bracelets (Ch2-4), Timely Bloom (Ch2-3), and Chiffon Shawls (Ch4-8) are required in a ton of recipes, so it's good to stock up now. * Spring Sakura Note: This suit does require some dias to crafts, but it's less than 150. * Nightly Spirit * White Swan and Black Swan have a good amount of maiden drops, so if you want to have them in the future, you might as well start working towards them now. * Luna Angel (not sure if the name is right) has simple crafting that requires maiden drops, and has cute recolors if you finish it too quickly for your liking. * Ice waltz</TEXT>

    <TEXT>My mom tried weed once in middle school and she hated it. Her older brother started smoking it in the 6th grade, and introduced her and her sister to it. She was the only one that didn't like it, and thank God for that, because her siblings inevitably moved on to worse drugs. Her brother is long dead, and her sister is so morbidly obese and brain-damaged she can't even wipe her own ass. I'm not saying marijuana is all bad, in fact it has some super cool medicinal purposes besides the recreational ones, but I'm saying it's bad if your brain isn't fully developed. You're 1000 times more likely to be dependent on it if you try it when you're underage, and it's also more likely to become a gateway drug.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I realize that. The point is, many girls felt as a whole like they didn't fit in in r/teenagers. The Girls:/Boys: and girls aren't real jokes constantly barraging you aren't exactly the most pleasant thing after a while. Because of that, feemagers was niche enough to gain a following, first from girls, second from guys who liked the positivity, and third from guys who just wanted to simp a little. I don't think a male-oriented sub would have that same draw, because I doubt guys feel excluded from r/teenagers because of their gender, which was initial draw for feemagers.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>7th grade was seriously the best year of my life. I was taking a super advanced class that I was very lucky to get into, and it opened my eyes to all different passions. It's the first year I did Model United Nations. I was finally brave enough to stand up for myself and tell my emotionally abusive father that I was done playing piano and I didn't care if that "made him sad". That proved to be a really good decision. I got a cellphone so I wasn't constantly isolated anymore. I got into anime, and made even more friends because of it. I was doing track and field, and I was shitty at it, but it was the first sport where my teammates weren't always mad at me because I was bad. I had an amazing, supportive classroom environment in my geography class, which restored my faith in teachers. I was finally allowed to get therapy, and it really helped me deal with a bunch of the childhood trauma that I carry. I was happy. I remember lying under the table with one of my friends, giggling, and in that moment it was like nothing bad existed. That summer, 3 of my close friends moved away, one was one of my best friends. Two of my friends that gave me a lot of my self confidence were a year older, so I was stuck in middle school when they got to go to highschool. My dad decided that therapy was a waste of money and had me stop going. I started self-harming again. A "friend" decided to cut me out of his life and bad-mouth me to everyone I held dear. Anyone he could rant to about me, he did. It didn't really damage my reputation, because people knew he was overdramatic, but it destroyed my self-esteem. 8th grade sucked ass. 9th grade was okay, but nothing can beat 7th grade.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>My opinion on r/teenagers has changed a lot. When I first found the sub, I thought it was awesome. I really felt like part of a community, it was great. When I joined also happened to be the time that girls were first getting really annoyed with the "girls aren't real" jokes. I actually didn't agree with that, I thought those jokes were pretty funny for a while. Then I started posting more, and anytime people knew I was a girl, I'd get "girls aren't real" jokes. They're funny the first time, but it starts to feel like what you have to say doesn't even matter. Anytime I'd post a selfie in r/feemagers I'd get a lot of support there, but guys from r/teenagers would see the posts if they looked at my profile, and many would continue on with their lives, a few would start simping, and a couple would start *creeping*. Getting DMs stops being fun once all the messages are just guys who was to play the number game (the picture with the numbered questions that get increasingly sexual) and guys who "love your confidence and would like to see more pictures of you." I know this isn't just an r/teenagers thing, but it started happening around the time I started loosing touch with the subreddit. The final straw for me was the boys vs girls memes. When it was just the locker room I thought it was actually pretty funny. Then it started branching out to things like wearing funny clothing, having goofy phone wallpaper, chaotic sleepovers, peeing in the shower, masturbating, etc. It kept reinforcing the notion that girls were basic and uninteresting. I was an am not offended by such memes. There are girls who were, and I think they were overreacting. That being said, seeing memes constantly pop up on your feed talking about how girls are boring and guys are quirky gets old, and it can really start to make you feel unwelcome. I'm not trying to be the joke police and act like everyone has to be included in everything, because they don't. But in their peak these jokes were everywhere, and they were excessive, and the subreddit stopped being fun. I ended up going completely to feemagers. I was super active there, and for a long time I had the top post on the subreddit. It definitely wasn't my best or proudest post, but it made me feel like I had finally found a fun community. But feemagers got bigger. And I saw the same kind of dismissal that girls got on r/teenagers happening to boys on r/feemagers. I'm not surprised. r/teenagers is such a hivemind at this point, I can understand why girls might lump all guys together, even if it isn't fair. That being said, posts on that sub started to be more attention seeking, low effort, and karma whoring. It's starting to look more and more like an effeminate version of r/teenagers. At this point I'm not in either sub. I feel like they both breed hidden layers of toxicity, and that they are creating a lot of animosity between the genders. A lot of guys dislike feemagers, and a lot of girls dislike teenagers (sub) for the same reasons. Now I just hang in askteenboys/girls and it's all way more chill :)</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Personally, the lucky bags weren't worth it for me, because I didn't have much interest in this hell event, and while I loved all of the lucky bag suits, I really couldn't rationalize spending $100 on them. The only suits I was dying for were magic recipe and peach heart, especially since purple skin was free in the mail and that was the main draw for the unicorn suit for me. I ended up buying one bag. I got a monthly card, plus the 500 dias that go with it, and the bag was Magic recipe. I'm satisfied. I think if you really like the hell event, and all of the lucky bag suits, it might me more worth it because you'd end up with like 15 suits. If you can rationalize spending $100 on a mobile game, it is objectively a good value. That being said, times are really uncertain right now, so be sure that you won't need that money for other things. $100 is a surprisingly large amount of money, and you'll want to be confident in whatever decision you make.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I absolutely adore Caroline. I used to pretty much ignore any character that wasn't datable, a shop owner, or useful for quests and stuff. I happened to need to befriend Caroline in order to get the tea sapling recipe, and the tea room cutscene is probably one of my favorites in the whole game. It's so whimsical and pretty. Even though I'm a lot younger than her, we have the same imaginative adventurous spirit and I could see myself being like her when I'm middle aged. She's definitely worth getting to know.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Hello! I'm not really sure what to say to stand out honestly. Most of my humor is situational, so I don't really have a funny joke. Here is a list of pleasant facts that calm me down and make me feel better: * Male penguins propose to female penguins with pretty stones. If they are rejected, they are shunned by all of the females for a few days, after which they try again. When penguins become mates, they truly feel love (or some semblance of love) for each other. * Certain species or birds have been shown to give names to their chicks. Social species of birds will also learn the names of the birds in their gangs. * Bob Ross received fan letters every day, and when frequent writers lost touch, he would call them every day * Cows like music. A study was conducted, and dairy cows that listened to music produced 3% more milks than the control group because they were slightly more relaxed. It was noted that they seemed to especially like Bridge Over Troubled Waters by Simon and Garfunkel. * Mr. Rogers had a fishtank, and whenever he fed the fish on his show, he'd always announce that he was doing so. This is because a blind girl wrote him a letter saying that she knew he had fish, and wanted to make sure that they were fed.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>While it is good to have freedoms, if your parents don't hold you to any standard or make you take some responsibility, you'll develop a lot of bad habits that'll be hard to shake. For example, I have friends who can stay up as late as they want and sleep in as late as they want (when there's no school obviously). I can usually stay up as late as I want, but when there's no school my parents make me get up at 8 am every single morning. It definitely sucks sometimes, but at the same time I get so much more out of my days than my friends, I'm less caffeine addicted than my friends, and it's a lot easier for me to wake up and be productive when I need to. Enforcing the rules is definitely a slippery slope, because it's super harmful when parents are too controlling, but it's also harmful when parents are too lax.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I used to post selfies on feemagers and just delete them after a week once conversation had died down, but I got really tired of feemagers as it grew bigger and stopped posting. I also grew tired of all of the harassment I would get. People would DM me and be super awkward trying to befriend me but it was super obvious they didn't just want to be friends. People would tell me that they love my style and want to see more pictures. I got really good at recognizing the signs of grooming lol. The worst was people who'd message me telling me that they were jacking off to me. Around the time the boys vs girls memes became a thing, I made a (rather cringy) PSA meme about how boys weren't the only ones who jacked off and it's actually because the top post of all time on feemagers for a few monthes. Because of that everyone who sorted by top would see it. I got some people who would see that, go to my profile, see a picture, and DM me assuming that because I've admitted to masturbating of course I'd want to send them nudes and talk all about it. Then of course there were the pedophiles, but I only encountered a few, and they did get me karma on r/creepypms XD</TEXT>

    <TEXT>For a developed country, the US is super cagey. American Flags everywhere, fences everywhere, privately owned hospitals. There are signs everywhere that say beware of dog, private property, forget about the dog beware of owner, etc. We're also super obsessive over anthems and pledges. When Colin Kaepernick kneeled during the national anthem to protest police brutality a few years back, people burned their Kaepernick jerseys and sent his family death threats. Also we recite a pledge of allegiance in all public schools. I guarantee you every American-born kid in the country has it memorized. I live up Northwest where it's pretty liberal, so we only do it on Mondays and you don't have to participate if you don't want, but I'm sure it's even crazier down South. The entire school stands up in their classrooms, faces the American flag that is present in every single classroom, and says the pledge in unison. Pretty cult-like huh? That being said almost everyone participates, myself included. I can't really explain why I do it, nobody's making me, it's just what I've always done.</TEXT>

We were writing some resolutions and I was giving a lot of input when the leader of our club goes, "Squawks, I love you, but I'd really like to hear from some other people as well." So of course I shut up and let everyone talk. Except nobody was talking. It was dead silence. I had only been talking to save her ass from the crippling silence she'd have to suffer if I wasn't there. But she hadn't seen that, and boy or boy was it quiet. Our club leader is a Junior, and she's a sweet person, but she gets a little ahead of herself sometimes XD</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I'm a highschool student, and it really saddens me how many kids just don't put in any effort. I wish that every kid that got bad grades because they didn't care or thought they weren't smart would just pick one academic class, and just put effort in for a term. I'm not talking about going above and beyond. I'm talking about studying for tests, fully completing assignments, and turning them in on time. I think people would be surprised by how good their grade would be. I'm a straight A student, and yeah, sometimes I have to work my ass off, but a surprising amount of classes literally came down to whether you did all the homework or not. That's it.</TEXT>

Say what you will about kpop, but he was truly an amazing singer, dancer, and one of the few idols to write his own music. He committed suicide in late 2017, and it shook south Korea and the rest of the world. There's a lot of stigma around mental health in Korea, and the kpop industry is pretty toxic, so this was the first time a lot of people were realizing how much some idols were suffering in the industry.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I posted a picture of my homecoming outfit on Reddit earlier this fall (homecoming is a football game/dance that happens in the fall for American highschoolers). A couple hours later, I got a DM from some guy saying that he was probably going to come across as super creepy, but he was pretty sure he went to school with me because I looked familiar and our homecoming was on the same day. I asked him what our school mascot and colors were, because I wasn't about to name drop our school, and he immediately got them right. I know he's a junior and a band kid, but I never asked him who he was. I'd honestly rather stay blissfully ignorant. I never tell anyone my Reddit account because I've opened up here about my self-harm and childhood trauma, so it's weird to think that there's some kid at my school who potentially knows all of that stuff.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Trigger warning: When I was younger I was (and still am, mind you) pretty depressed. When you're a preteen though, you have a pretty skewed world view. I was constantly invalidated by my parents. I began to wish that I was bullied or abused because then at least my feelings would be "real." It felt like everything was in my head and that I'd never get acceptance. I know this sounds petty, but I was 11 years old, so all I really wanted was to just be comforted. People were comforted when they were hurt. But my injuries were invisible, so there was nobody there for me, not even myself. So I made the injuries visible. I started self-harming. I obviously never showed my parents, but I gained a kind of self-acceptance that I never had before. I definitely don't condone self-harm, but it's effects on me weren't entirely negative. I'm older now, and I rarely self-harm, but I continue to work on myself. One thing that I do reccomend is to do favors for your future self. Don't have to do something until tomorrow, do it now. Tommorow, thank your past self for making life just a little bit easier.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I remember when I was littler, my mom and I had this tradition where every once and a while we'd compile all of our coupons and get something overpriced. We were eating at a fast food restaurant called Carl's Jr, and we had coupons scattered all over the table, scanning them to see what cool new things we could try. I remember asking my mom if I could get milk, and her telling me she'd rather not because it was expensive and we have milk at home. We didn't realize it at the time, but overhearing that conversation and seeing all us scanning coupons could give people the impression that we didn't have very much money. In reality, my family's pretty well off, just frugal. They had humble beginnings and have tried to raise me the same way. Low and behold a nice old guys comes up to our table and offers to pay for my milk. We declined, of course, but it was really meaningful to know that there are caring people out there who will do nice little things for strangers.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Not as much a misconception, as much as something I'm shocked people don't know better about. **Do not feed bread to ducks.** It fills then up so they can't find nutritious food, gives them a condition called angel wing that makes them unable to fly, and makes chicks dependent on humans. If that wasn't bad enough, their stomachs aren't meant to digest bread, so it will sometimes mold in their intestines and kill them from the inside out. If you absolutely *have* to feed the ducks, feed them grapes (cut in half), lettuce, defrosted frozen peas or corn, barley, etc.</TEXT>

Does anyone here remember that one guy on Reddit who wanted to casually do heroin? He ended up getting very addicted and two AMAs and a bunch of rehab later and he's finally getting his life back on track.</TEXT>

You'll have to do some studying and put in some grunt work if you want to excel of course, but it's not unreasonable for a parent to expect their kid to get at least "C"s.</TEXT>

None of you had to experience the horror that was "Thank You Berry Munch" (yes, that's the actual name of the cookie). Picture this: Dry flavorless cookie, cranberries, and yogurt chips. And if you think eating them would be miserable, imagine trying to sell them. They were always the ones we had extra of, no matter how few we ordered, so when cookie season was over, not only did our troop loose money, but we all had to eat them for snack every girl scout meeting until they were gone.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>People calling me by my legal name. I have a sizable amount of childhood trauma under my belt. I started going by a nickname at right around the same time I began to realize how fucked up my home life was, and for whatever reason now I associate trauma with my legal name. Obviously I still get called it by new teachers on the first day of school, by substitutes, by parents of old elementary school classmates from before I went by the nickname, and my parents friends. If people call me it when they're first meeting me, it's not too bad, and I'll just tell them my nickname and casually ask them to call me that. It only really starts to trigger me when people continue to call me my legal name. The issue is that my legal name is apparently very unique and pretty, so sometimes people, especially older ones, continue to call me that. I also had a former friend turn on me, and he called me by my legal name for a time because he knew it upset me. I'm also triggered the word "selfish," my father's piano playing, and several songs including an entire Adele album and "Greensleeves".</TEXT>

    <TEXT>It definitely sucks to be female sometimes, but before I say why, I'd also like to acknowledge the fact that guys face unique problems as well, so it'd be closed minded for me to say that women have it worse than men. Something I absolutely hate is that guys (probably just guys on the internet, mind you) always have some sort of statistic about women that's supposed to dictate how all of them behave. "Statistically men are better at video games, 80% of women go for the top 20% of men, etc) First of all, statistics can be manipulated to show whatever statement people want. I don't know the full story behind most statistics, and I doubt the people who repeat them to me do either. Second of all, who the fuck cares? Just because 70% of women do something doesn't mean I do too. I also hate how much women's bodies and activities in general are sexualized sometimes. I make a lot of dirty jokes with my friends, and it sucks when you think of a funny joke, but you realize it's off limits to you because it would make things too weird or sexual, but if a guy were to do it it'd be funny.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I've heard this question asked before a few times, and I can't help but think people spend way too much time obsessing over last words. Most people die in their sleep, in an accident, or at least partially incapacitated in a hospital. People in these scenarios often aren't able to say any last words at all. Don't spend time planning out the last things you want to say to your loved ones. Say them now, while you have the chance. Life is fleeting, and the last thing you may end up saying will probably be something lame like "don't worry, I've never had trouble driving at night," "it's just a cough, I'll call the doctor tomorrow morning," "fuck off," "see you tomorrow," "hospital food tastes like shit," etc. Don't wait. People will not remember the last thing you said to them nearly as much as they remember the way you made them feel throughout their lives. If you love someone, tell them now. Tell them tommorow. Keep telling, because one day, you won't be able to.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I remember going to the community pool near my house for swimming lessons when I was pretty little. Most people shower off in their swimsuits and then go change, but it's pretty normal for kids and old ladies to shower naked. My swimming lessons just so happened to be after a water aerobics class, so there was plenty of soggy, wrinkly, 80 year old boob to go around. It wasn't exactly an exciting experience. I don't remember being particularly repulsed; most of these women were in okay shape anyways, so it could've been a lot worse. I think being exposed when I was so young was why I was so chill about the whole thing.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>As backwards as this sounds, sexualizing women (and people in general) less will make society more sex-positive. The idea that women's chests need to be censored but mens' chests don't, implies that a woman's body is inherently sexual. Also, let people be close to each other without immediately assuming it's a sexual thing. Our society is too obsessed with sex in a way that actually makes society more sex-negative.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Furries aren't that bad. 99.9% of furries have no interest in beastiality, and the vast majority don't have it as a kink either. Most furries are just people who like art or making/wearing costumes. Most kids like to pretend to be animals, and this interest has simply grown up with some people. I'd compare it to people who like superheroes when they're little, and now they collect memorabilia or cosplay. Sure, it can be cringy sometimes, but these people are just having fun, and should be left alone. Usually when I voice this opinion, I just get shut down and called a furry.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Person who *may or may not* be pansexual here... If I'm being honest, I think a lot of the "homophobes" here aren't actually homophobic, they're just frustrated with the pride movement. Now, I'm all for gay pride, and I'm happy that people are finally able to be comfortable in their own skin, but there's a difference between celebrating being able to be openly gay, and making your sexuality your main personality trait. I'm not saying we should cancel pride events, I like pride events. I've been to many pride events, and this issue is when people start getting very physical, or getting very kinky. First of all, BDSM shouldn't have a place at pride. I don't think it should be stigmatized, but there are children at these events. I think that BDSM is a perfectly respectable "interest," but there are many who find it u comfortable, innappropriate, or just kind of icky. That can be said for any kink. That's not homophobic. But if we aren't careful, less informed people will start to see LGBTQ+ as something inherently kinky, which it isn't. Also, I've seen people make out at pride, in public, surrounded by people. Not only do I consider this somewhat trashy to do in general, straight couples included, but this scares off a lot of people who are maybe uncomfortable with LGBTQ+, but are trying to be open minded. We need to stop condemning people for admitting that they're uncomfortable with gay people. Many people have no experience with gay people (as fare as they know), and this can be a teaching opportunity to help people accept any bias, and move past it. Many people are willing to have an open mind if we give them the chance. Also, being gay doesn't mean you get special privileges. I think that gay people deserve all the compassion in the world, but when it comes down to it, I care more about the content of someone's character than any other factor. There is a surprising amount of hate within the gay community too. People gatekeeping the community, saying that bisexual people are only allowed if they're dating partners of the same gender, completely excluding asexual people, etc. I've been told by people in the gay community, that I'm pansexual for attention because I want to be, "not like the other girls" and I've been told that "pride doesn't want me" because of some of the opinions I shared above. I think that the more extravagant we make the LGBTQ+ movement seem, the more we alienate the people it's supposed to support.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>When I get that feeling of guilt in the back of my mind, and I start replaying some shitty thing I did or shitty thing that happened in my peripheral thinking. I'll "zoom in" on the thought only to realize that I didn't do anything shitty, and I just have a cluster of misery that's pretending to have a memory to attach itself to. When everything seems like a waste of time, and when there isn't really anything that I want to do. When all that seems appealing to me is sleep. Not because I'm tired, not because I'm bored or unmotivated. There's just something so appealing about being unconscious. It seems like the only solution in my head. When no matter how hot I am, I always feel cold. When I can't focus on anything because my head is filled with sludge.</TEXT>

I had to go up on stage when I won, and thank God in front of two hundred mostly Christian kids. It wasn't embarrassing in the traditional sense, but it felt like I was lying to them. Some of you may ask why I even went to this camp at all. That's because it was the only overnight camp nearby, it was affordable, and besides the preaching, had super fun opportunities an good food.</TEXT>

I just feel like religion is used to exploit people, and is behind a lot of wars and prejudice. And no, I'm not just some circlejerking atheist. I'm agnostic. I don't think there's concrete evidence that there's a higher power or life after death, but I also don't have any evidence to deny it either. I think if there is a God, it's not going to be petty enough to care whether we worship it or not. People should focus on being good people, and they can worry about what happens after death once they're dead.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Yep. There's the obligatory "I'm part of a private teen subreddit focused on body-positivity, are you interested?" as well as the guys who pretend to be gay and try to befriend you because they think you'll be more comfortable talking about sexual stuff with a guy who you think isn't into you. There's also the guys from r/teenagers. Half the time they're super nice people who just want to chat; I've made many friends this way. The other half the time, they say shit like "I just want to get to know you and see where things go" or they ask you to play the "number game." One time there was a guy who asked me if I was into ddlg after he saw a pic I posted of my homecoming outfit... That was pretty gross... I'm not nearly as active as I used to be though, especially in teen subs, so I don't get weird DMs very often anymore.</TEXT>

I decided that just this once I'd splurge because I really love the harvest suits. I've been spacing out my purchases and careful not to overspend or waste my free attempts. Today I was spending some diamonds to get the next tier in my second suit. I wanted to buy 17 attempts. ***And I accidentally bought 170...*** It hurts. I'm never going to live this down. The only one I have to blame is myself. I just spent 1.7k diamonds on an event that I only needed to spend 500 more to complete.

It's her body, and she should never have to subject herself to anything she doesn't consent to. Childbirth can do incredible damage to a person, and even be fatal.

    <TEXT>Like a 6. I'm somewhat flat chested. This has never been a point of insecurity for me, because there's a lot of convenience that goes with being on the smaller side. Plus, I've heard countless male friends say that they don't care about size when they're interested in a girl. Recently though, some of my discord friends have started joking about how I look like a kid. I'm also kind of babyfaced, so that also plays into it. For whatever reason, these jokes make me really self conscious. I just laugh along with them or act upset in a comedic way. Some of them are actually pretty funny, but there are a lot of them that make me feel bad.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>This probably won't help you with the event lore, but PopNikki on youtube has a series on her channel where she recaps each chapter. She's up to chapter 18, which is pretty helpful. I also find the wiki, and the manga are pretty helpful with finding out the lore. The wiki also helps with the lore from past events and the dreamweavers. I can't help much with the lore because I'm super slow at grinding through Chapters, so I'm still on chapter 13 lol.</TEXT>

You only spend like 3 weeks on see ex, because they also talk about nutrition and exercise and stuff, but 3 weeks is a lot compared to what my friends get. It's definitely a boring class, but I can't deny it's probably a good class to take.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I have a little toolkit in my purse. It's got a tiny little adjustable wrench (spanner) and some attachments (tinny hammer head, Phillips head, flat blade screwdriver, and awl) that can all screw into this one little screwdriver handle. Sure it's not as good as the full size tools, but it's helped me in a pinch. I also recommend bringing your own eating utensils. I have a sleeve with a plastic fork, spoon, and chop sticks so that I don't have to use disposable utensils when I get fast food. Also, they make these wonderful silicone straws that you can fold and keep in a tin smaller than an altoids container. You can boil them to sanitize them (obviously still wash them first) and they're a great replacement for plastic straws. I have one in normal size, and one in boba straw size because I get boba so often XD</TEXT>

    <TEXT>When I was in 6tg grade, I was going through a really rough patch, and my self esteem had never been lower. I got on this pokemon forum website that a kid reccomended to me. It was kind of sweeping through my friend group at the time, and most kids got bored of it after about a week. I got really into it. It had a digital pokemon collection aspect to it, with shiny hunting and site-exclusive pokemon. It also had some pretty expansive forums, and even a way to self publish your own comics. I spend hours on those forums, playing games, trading art, role-playing, and making friends. Some of the people on there were definitely better than others, but in my 18 months of activity on the site, I didn't have even one truly bad interaction. Everyone was so kind to each other. I think this was because pretty much everyone had some interest they were persecuted for. There were furries, weebs, lots of LGBTQ people, and we all liked pokemon, so we all had something in common. The site's still running and though I haven't logged on in months and haven't been active in years, I've checked in occasionally and it still has that positive community. I'm not going to say the name because I don't want the reddit cesspool to find it and fill it with toxicity.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I'd just rather not define my beliefs with an umbrella term that can have so many meanings. When you label yourself, you're taking away your chance to explain yourself, and opening the door for people to have assumptions about you. I believe in gender equality. There are many elements of our culture that hurt women, and I want to help change that, but nowhere does that involve any anti-men sentiment. Gender issues are a two-way street (plus some other lanes for the non-binary folk), and there are plenty of issues that men face as well. I just think that everyone needs to have empathy and listen to each other more.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I'm always really careful about that because you can never really know a person completely, and I don't want to be the one to invalidate someone by accident if they have an actual illness. OCD is definitely a case where I'll gently remind some people that it means a lot more than just being organized, and give them some other good words to describe themselves. This generally embarrasses people a little bit, and they're usually less likely to get defensive vs. if I just called them out.</TEXT>

I'd recommend getting a nintendo switch or switch lite. If you don't already know what kinds of games you'd like, I'd recommend overcooked (if you have other people to play with), Super Mario, Animal Crossing, or Mario Kart. Nintendo games are usually pretty easy to pick up, and usually don't require as much time investment or competitiveness as games on other consoles.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I'm best friends with a guy. We tell each other almost everything, and read each like books. People always think we're together, and some have a really hard time believing that we're completely platonic. I talked about him once with some guys online that I play games with, and they were all joking about how they felt sorry for him because he was stuck in the friendzone. They didn't believe me at all when I said he didn't have feelings for me, and kept saying that as guys they "know these things." We've been friends since we were really young, and there were obviously some feelings tossed around when we were really hormonal and stupid, but we actively joke about that now. He's pursuing a mutual friend of ours so there's seriously nothing between us. Assuming that people will only be friends with a gender they aren't attracted to is such a narrow minded way of thinking imo. This isn't just a thing for straight people either. There's this notion that lesbians only have male friends and gay guys only have female friends as well, which is just nonsensical. Also, what about me? I'm pansexual, so does that mean none of my friendships are platonic?</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Biden is at the very least rational person. We've seen him be pretty rational as vice president for 8 years, and he's also know to work with people across party lines. I'm not saying he's a saint, but he's at least not going to try to put his financial gain or his party's agenda first. He hasn't always been on the right side of a debate, but he's been in politics for a long time and obviously changed many of his ideals for the better over the years. These days he's very invested in helping the low-income areas of our country. I personally believe that he will make things better, but I can say with certainty that he won't make things worse, so take a look at the county right now (you can factor out covid if you want to, although Trump definitely didn't handle that well) and ask yourself if you'd like things to stay the way they are. Environmental regulations have been cut away bit by bit, our trade with other countries is suffering and hurting american farmers, affordable quality healthcare is farther away from the people who need it, etc. Trump's slogan this time around is "Keep America Great." Last time it was "Make America Great," so going by that, we can infer that the Trump Administration is satisfied with the way the country is going. If you're satisfied, vote for Trump. If you aren't, vote for Biden.</TEXT>
