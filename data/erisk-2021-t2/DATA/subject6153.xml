    <TITLE>NZ Shoe Collecting</TITLE>
    <DATE>2018-12-20 02:58:39</DATE>
    <TEXT>Honestly, browsing this sub-reddit makes me so jealous, everyone paying few hundred for some hype shoes. Living in NZ, it #8217;s really quite hard to get some hype shoes over here, there #8217;s really no shoe outlets or anything here that sell anything worth collecting. I brought some Yeezy Cream whites, and that alone cost me $780, because of exchange rate, and important duty tax. Anyone have any advice on ways I could come about growing my shoe collection? Any good places AU/NZ or close?</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I was buying a pair of sneakers on GOAT.com and without realising I payed with an old cancelled credit card and the shoes were confirmed. The payment is now in my account as pending, but should it even end up there if the card is cancelled? Will the payment still go through (I want it to), or will it forever pend?</TEXT>

    <TITLE>Sesames 350 V2 Cleaning Methods?</TITLE>
    <DATE>2019-01-09 01:29:54</DATE>
    <TEXT>So I copped a pair of Sesames yesterday, and was wondering ways I could clean them? I also own a pit of Cream whites and I just chuck them in the washing machine with alittle stain remover and clear detergent and they come out good as new. Would this be the same case with the sesames? I was tempted on doing it but I #8217;m scared the colour might leak? Or does it not work like that? Any info or tips on how to clean my sesames would be helpful, hopefully I can just clean em like my Cream whites.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Recently copped a pair of Yeezy 350 Sesames, was wondering if the ways I can clean them are the same as my 350 Cream Whites? With my whites I am able to use crap etc, but if the stains are bad I can chuck them into the washing machine on a cold temperature with clear stain remover, Am I able to do the same with my Sesames? Or would it strip the dye?</TEXT>

    <TEXT>New Zealander here. I have 8 pairs of shoes, 7 of those are considered  #8216;hype #8217; (OW, Yeezy, Jordan). I pay import tax on anything over $150USD. At $150USD import tax is around $100NZD. Because most hype shoes don #8217;t drop in my country, or atleast not in my size (Size 14US), I pay between $300-$500USD for my hype pairs of shoes. Which roughly lands me with around $200-$300NZD of import tax on top of the .org ini always price and exchange rate of the shoes. My cream whites cost me $700NZD, my sesames cost me $600, my OW AF1 cost me $1,150, and so forth. Out of the 8 pairs, I #8217;d have to go with atleast $4,000NZD in the last year. I #8217;m a 17 year old with a part time job and honestly have really no regrets due to the fact that I don #8217;t pay bills/rent yet. So I #8217;m living whilst I can. The New Zealand sneaker game is a bitch.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>First proper one. Personally, I don #8217;t agree unless we are talking about euthanasia for people who are extremely disabled or in terrible pain without end in sight. For problems, for the most part I reckon life can infect get better, some times they don #8217;t and I understand that, personally I don #8217;t believe suicide is the right option, as I believe there is always something to live for, even if you don #8217;t know it yet. You #8217;ll never know what tomorrow brings if you aren #8217;t here for it, so personally, I side with those who choose life. In no way do I bash people who commit, it #8217;s a terribly sad thing people feel they need to do that, and it affects many more than just themselves. Just a shit situation all round.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Hey! I do understand the experience, attempted and survived. Personally, in my experience alone I #8217;m so happy it didn #8217;t work out and I feel like after that moment I slowly changed my life around and saw the good in the world I guess. Not saying that this is how everyone sees anything, just my experience. Personally, it always felt like it would never end, but one day something just clicked, the sun seemed alittle brighter, and this just changed, though I did put my mind to change.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Mostly true, so many of the current  #8216;unfair situations #8217; are completely self made or self conditioned. As for gender, in the western world, women actually have more rights than men, including maternity leave, etc. In some countries men can apply for maternity leave though. On the side of mental state, sexual harassment, and abuse, women are far better off support, having women shelters etc. men however do not, male suicide rates are almost triple what women suicide rates are solely because of a societal view that men must be masculine, which is partly men, but also women #8217;s fault. In all, I #8217;d say racially, most have the same advantages if you actually put yourself out there and look for them, minority groups are even more likely to be accepted to prestigious colleges. In regards to gender equality, I believe women currently have it better then men.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Honestly, I feel that. I #8217;ve only recently got into the jist of buying on launch #8217;s, as they aren #8217;t super common in New Zealand, but I love the community around sneakers and just how everyone reacts to everything different. So much more than just shoes. Welcome though! Say goodbye to all your money.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Good day, I was hoping open to the TC-MCB (TeenagerCity, Main Central Bank). If this business was to be successful, we can be the middle man to large purchases, such as resources, arms, vehicles, etc. The TC-MCB will be in charge of currency production and management within the city. We can help value items to be put to sale, and give loans to members with an interest. You will be able to have an account with the bank, both debit (your own currency), and credit (the banks money, which will need to be paid back before a certain time to not receive an interest on the said amount). This account can be used for all purchases within the city, but will keep a record of said purchases. Thank you.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I #8217;m more than aware that women may choose happiness over sneakers. Personally, I don #8217;t buy my sneakers in hopes of pleasing women, I do it because it helps build my self confidence, which at the age of 17 is rather timid, but that #8217;s not uncommon. My life doesn #8217;t revolve around pleasing women, I have a girlfriend I #8217;m perfectly happy with spoiling and she understands my love for sneakers, and I don #8217;t feel the need to be arrogant in a subreddit dedicated to the hobby of collecting and wearing sneakers. Let people enjoy what they want. It really isn #8217;t that hard.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Not funny but more of a cringy story. There #8217;s this one foreign exchange student that goes to my school. She has a pair of Gucci Sneakers, I can #8217;t recall the name but it #8217;s got a snake on the side. Anyways, cool shoes, I #8217;m jealous. She wears them like fucking flip flops though. Doesn #8217;t even bother to slip her foot all the way in and just destroys the back of her shoes. Why do people do this? It isn #8217;t the first time I #8217;ve seen it as well.

    <TEXT>Some have different stock, or higher demand. 350 v1s such as the turtle doves are PG and have a lower deadstock stock now, so their price is high. 350 v2s like the cream whites have many, many pairs deadstock still so their price is lower. The ones that are cheaper we #8217;re either more largely produced, or the colourway flopped and no hype was behind it. Not sure if this is correct, but just my thought. Cheers bro</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Y12 New Zealander here. Trust me, 90% of your time your opinion on what you #8217;d like to do when you #8217;re older will change throughout your high school career, if it doesn #8217;t, then that #8217;s great. If you find yourself enjoying something that goes against what you originally wanted to do, maybe you should listen to yourself. Though remember, it #8217;s likely to change again throughout high school, and likely even in uni. Goodluck tho bro! I #8217;ve wanted to be a thousand different things, I hope you find what you like to do soon!</TEXT>

Careers advisors are always there to help you, regardless if you change your mind, that #8217;s why they #8217;re hired.

    <TEXT>No absolutely, guns are the problem. But it #8217;s the American populations mindset that guns equal freedom. They #8217;re brainwashed by an outdated constitution that allows them the right to firearms. Disregarding that the fact that when it was written it took like two minutes to reload after a shot. There #8217;s so many guns in rotation in the US that banning them and taking every gun is next to impossible.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Fair. They should ban ammunition, or limit it to a very small amount. Like maximum ammo per hunting season. I don #8217;t believe normal citizens need military style rifles, but hunting rifles that require you to chamber a round everytime you Shoot rather than shooting 40 shots back to back should be fine. Why would you need an automatic rifle? Limit ammunition and ban unneeded rifles.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Exactly. If you ban ammunition, or certain types, or atleast limit amounts of ammunition one person is legally allowed will reduce the chances of someone killing 70 people. Obviously, it #8217;s all very easy to propose these ideas, but we have to remember that America has been selling weapons to its citizens since the countries origin. The amount of ammunition and firearms is most likely beyond belief. It #8217;s a long process that America needs to take more seriously though. Surely peoples lives are more important than some rules on a piece of paper.</TEXT>

Though, if you want strong gun laws, and cool nature, New Zealand bro. We #8217;re ranked #1 in freedom, gotcha US, we now have tighter gun laws than we already did have, makes the US gun laws look like a 6th grade spelling test. Plus we have a population of like 4.6 million, so lots of room and fresh air!</TEXT>

I believe ages need to be raised, more intensive background checks need to be held, such as looking into relations with family members etc. take Japans purchasing process. They look at family members, links to extremist groups, you must attending whole day workshops, pass a marksman course and have over 90% accuracy rate, pass mental health check, and I #8217;m sure there is more I #8217;m missing.

I feel like when the constitution was written, the ability to overthrow the government was a lot more realistic than today when America is one of the biggest superpowers of the world.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Sucks for me, I #8217;m a white male, but that #8217;s okay. I assume we #8217;re talking about grades in University rather than highschool, not that it would be a problem. Any idea if doing Scholarship English would look good to any Unis/Firms? We don #8217;t really get told any of this at school. I was looking to go into a law involving property, not quite sure if there is a name for that sort of law, so I #8217;m not particularly sure if the job openings for this sort of law is very large. I definitely want to work with a few charities, I #8217;m already trying to get into that scene anyways, I had no idea that could possibly help me. My only other work experience is McDonalds, which I #8217;m sure won #8217;t particularly help me. And sweet as, I #8217;ll definitely do the summer thing, as I just assumed more experience made you a better candidate. Sorry about all the questions, we don #8217;t really get told any of this in school, and seeing all this worries me that maybe I #8217;m making the wrong choice about my career path.</TEXT>

It #8217;s good to know that large firms have a better chance of hiring you if you #8217;ve had an internship with them before. One last questions, is Christchurch a somewhat okay place for law students? Currently living in Christchurch and was wondering if I would be okay staying in my hometown rather than moving.

    <TEXT>New Zealander here. Best bet is probably Goat or StockX. You could maybe find some local reseller like we have in New Zealand on Instagram, but it #8217;s risky and costs practically the same price as copping off StockX or GOAT. I don #8217;t know if you get import taxes there, but look out for that, might add another $150 to your charge.</TEXT>

    <TITLE>Balenciaga Speed Trainers Sizing</TITLE>
    <DATE>2019-08-23 11:15:16</DATE>
    <TEXT>Gidday boys. So I was looking at a pair of Balenciaga speed runners, not sure if these are looked down on in this subreddit as my casual hours of scrolling have only produced a few pairs here, but I was wondering about how they are when it comes to sizing. I #8217;m a size 14US, and on StockX the balenciaga only goes to a size 47EU. Would this fit me? I have no idea how they fit, or if they would fit a size 14 foot. I did some googling and sizes 47-48EU are considered 14US, so would a size 47EU fit me? Sorry for the dumb question boys, thanks for the help in advance.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I took Maori before NCEA, I didn #8217;t like the stigma behind white guys trying to take it. All I remember from it was myself and the other white guys being called Pakeha by the teacher (not that it bothers me) and being constantly judged by the actual Maori students in the class. It #8217;s almost as if we got judged for trying to better ourselves at the language. You wouldn #8217;t think it #8217;s that common but I #8217;ve asked around and it #8217;s quite common. And I agree, history is interesting, I like learning it. But all I do is learn important stuff and spew it onto a page and then forget about it. Infact that #8217;s realy all of NCEA, we learn the important stuff, stuff that #8217;ll give us a good mark, we spew it IMO the page, and then we forget it all. NCEA isn #8217;t about retaining situation in the long run, just long enough for it to get us out credits and then it #8217;s not important anymore. Also the time restraints on projects. Some projects are fair, 3 weeks is a fair time, but some students (not myself but I #8217;m not ignorant to people that need more time) but 3 days to write a large paper is fair for some, but not even one is a fast worker, some people need time to process their work. Really, NCEA is an unfair system that doesn #8217;t really care about individuals, it #8217;s just grades and stress. Though that #8217;s life haha, oh well.</TEXT>

Also, as for my case and many others, we #8217;ve just come from school and we #8217;ve already had to deal with dickhead kids and teachers for 7 hours, and then we have some entitled old person argue with us in the drive through because someone got to take their order before them. It #8217;s never really a personal thing tho, don #8217;t get me wrong! There are heaps of friendly staff, atleast where I work, but normally we #8217;re all just tired, a lot of our managers like to yell at us school kids and yeah, minimum wage normally equals minimum effort.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Compared to other stores, we cook our food to order a lot more. To give more detail. Other stores will get really busy and they #8217;ll end up around 2-3 trays of 1/10 patties, so that #8217;s around 18 patties in total if they follow procedure. These could take awhile to sell if you hit a slow selling point, so they may sit there for a bit. We are actually meant to throw it out after 15 minutes, but by that time it #8217;s normally used, or, like most employees do, they just restart the timer. The McDonalds I work at (Ferry Rd), we hold a lot lower amounts of food because our low selling periods normally run for a couple hours. We have a large rush during the lunch and dinner times, but between these times it #8217;s relatively quiet. If you come during the quiet periods 1-5 you #8217;ll either get a freshly cooked patty, or one that #8217;s been sitting there for a bit. Whereas if you come through during a rush, you #8217;ll likely get a fresh patty (1-4 minutes old) with your burger because we are taking so much. The reason they are greasy is a lot of batch cooks don #8217;t empty their patty trays, so the oils and grease build up. I try my best to clear the trays though, cause I #8217;m sure the patty swimming in grease isn #8217;t gonna taste amazing. If you #8217;ve got any more questions I #8217;m more than happy to answer!</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I guess that #8217;s viable aswel, and undoubtably a large majority will go right back to dealing. No idea how it works but if they have the weight amount of cannabis the person had on them during the time of arrest, maybe it could be based off that? There #8217;s really no easy way around it to differentiate those who just want to get high and those looking to make bank of it.</TEXT>

I #8217;d agree with this notion for those with records for possession for personal use (no idea if it #8217;s possible to differentiate, maybe a set number of Gs) and I believe possession without intent to sell should have their records cleaned, but for those looking to sell, surely they should still suffer the consequences of their actions?</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I agree. I definitely reckon records should be expunged for those found guilty of possession for personal use. Dealers shouldn #8217;t be given the same treatment. They looked to make money off an illegal substance by distributing it, completely different. And as you said, if they #8217;re willing to sell cannabis I #8217;m sure they #8217;re willing to sell more than just that. I believe it might be very hard to differentiate between personal possession and distribution due to people pleading guilty for lesser charges.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I read the following, though I don #8217;t know if it #8217;s a bias article:  #8220;A 2012 article in the journal World Development reported that  #8220;countries with legalised prostitution have a statistically significantly larger reported incidence of human trafficking inflows #8221;.  #8220;Decriminalisation of the sex trade does nothing to protect those selling sex #8221;.  #8220;Brothel owners could choose their prices, they say all-inclusive [which means the punter can have sex with the woman he has paid for as many times as he wishes], #8221; says Valisce.  #8220;So clients would go into the room, see a girl and she would have to deal with them wanting to do anything and everything. #8221; No idea if this article is bias at all, or over exaggerating a very small minorities stories, but from this it doesn #8217;t seem like it helped very much.

    <TEXT>So it #8217;s more difficult to just release someone or take away the possession charge because it normally is accompanied by possession of other substances? I get that, it would definitely make it difficult for the legal system to go through every single case to see if they are able to have their changes expunged.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Ah I understand now. By all means, I #8217;m perfectly happy for those that have broken simply cannabis charges for say, possession? To have their charges expunged, and I believe that that part of the Misuse of Drug Act 1975 (no idea if that #8217;s what we use when referring to the criminalisation of cannabis) should infact be changed. But those who are in for possession of cannabis with intent to sell shouldn #8217;t receive the same treatment, regardless if it is mixed with other drug related convictions. But yep, fully understand the past offences of possession with intent of personal use should be fully removed from any record.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Sounds like a good plan, I like the fact you included solely cannabis charges. I agree completely. Once they are able to find a job, or job in the newly legalised cannabis industry their charges could be expunged. Though I #8217;m still a bit iffy if I believe it should be fully erased. Legislation still doesn #8217;t change the fact that they willingly broke the law when it was illegal.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>DEFINITION: Antisemitism is hostility to, prejudice, or discrimination against Jews. A person who holds such positions is called an antisemite. Antisemitism is generally considered to be a form of racism. WHY IT #8217;S WRONG: Literally another form of racism. Yes, suffering isn #8217;t a contest. But members of the Jewish Religion have been prosecuted and discriminated not only by the Germany, but many other countries, such as Russia and the like. We don #8217;t have to forget the absolute inhuman treatment of the 6 million Jewish citizens killed in the holocaust, and the others who were lucky enough to survive. Though we have issues today, it is important not to forget what the past, otherwise we may be doomed to repeat it again. It #8217;s not a contest, we as a species are perfectly capable of realising and acknowledging those who are suffering know whilst remembering the past mistakes of humans aswel.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Definitely another challenge, which hopefully we will overcome; we always seem to come up with something. I guess the media just highlights the worst of the older generations when it comes to climate change. The ones that attack sixteen year olds and blame anyone but themselves.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Honestly, I agree. As much as I #8217;ve bitched in this thread about being blamed, the generation that I #8217;m apart of (Gen Z? 2000+ onwards I have no idea) probably won #8217;t do much. Infact a lot of the people going to these climate strikes are just going to get a day off school. But I do feel like there is a larger awareness in how we are slowly fucking our world, but we definitely have a long way to go</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Non-Virgin here. Here #8217;s some insight: Sex is only as good as you make it. It can be terrible if either you or your partner doesn #8217;t put in the work or doesn #8217;t know what they are doing. It #8217;s a fair bit of work, but it #8217;s definitely enjoyable and a bit better than masturbation. Sex isn #8217;t solely about the physical feeling, it #8217;s also the mental and emotional connection which makes it even better. Don #8217;t rush into it, I #8217;m not one to say wait until marriage but at least wait until you find someone you #8217;re fully comfortable with, it #8217;ll be way better I promise. Good luck bro, remember losing your virginity doesn #8217;t make you the shit! Wait until you find someone you #8217;re emotionally and physically comfortable with! No need to rush</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I have no idea if the most expensive version is the one I #8217;m looking at buying, but I look at two different versions, and one had larger recoil than the other, more recoil than I #8217;ve felt in any other AEG. I #8217;m not looking at upgrading that much straight away, as I #8217;m still rather new and it doesn #8217;t all make sense to me. Would you suggest using 11.1v straight out of the box? I don #8217;t run the risk of burning anything out?</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Ah, I was looking at buying the TK45 with Electric Blow Back, I thought that it was really cool, and it #8217;s the first time I #8217;ve experienced it on an AEG before, though I know it #8217;s not entirely rare. What would you suggest between the two versions, I #8217;m very tempted to get the TK45 over the TK45C as the price difference is really only $60NZD, though if it #8217;s more unreliable I #8217;m always swayed. I #8217;ve seen a few videos online saying the battery compartment is a tight fit, is this the same for the TK45 as opposed to the TK45C? I noticed the TK45 was a tiny bit larger. Sorry for all the questions, just rather do some research before dropping a large sum on an AEG</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Heya everyone, I #8217;m a 17 year old with a pretty decent income (considering my age, and the fact I #8217;m still in school), and I was looking to get into investing, though I #8217;m lost and I don #8217;t know where to start. Is there places where I go to begin investing? I was hoping to possibly do it by myself, but I don #8217;t understand the stock markets, or should I rely on my bank to do this for me? Is there anywhere in NZ that helps with investment, or am I shit out of luck? Also, anyone that invests, is it really worth while doing it? I #8217;m not looking to become warren buffet but I #8217;ve heard it #8217;s a worth while thing to do, especially when you #8217;re younger.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>It's unbelievable. I've read this entire thread and its practically you saying 'Volcanoes and Earthquakes and more dangerous'. Even if that was the case, it doesn't downplay the serious effects that COVID-19 could have, health wise, and economy wise. It's ignorant not to have a plan, even if you don't believe it could have a large effect, surely it's safer to prepare rather than not. I don't see your argument as beneficial in any way.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>So I've recently got into playing AOE2 HD with my friends, it's been around two weeks, five ish games, and I'm still not doing really any good. I somewhat know how to follow the build order, but from there I'm lost. I tend to play defensive up until Imp/Castle, so I'm unsure of what Civ I should choose that helps to optimise this. Some have told me to try Teutons, but after reading on here, apparently they aren't amazing? Does anyone have any insight? What civ should I try out? Cheers lads.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Hey guys! Just came here to see if any of you guys could help me with a weird audio glitch I've started having today. It sounds like all my sound is coming through a pringles can, quite echoed and a constant static sound. I've cleared my Game Cache and the issue remains. It only occurs when I join a game, not in the main menu. I don't know if anyone else has had this problem, but if anyone might know a fix please let me know :)</TEXT>
