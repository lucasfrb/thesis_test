    <TITLE>Help me start my journey today</TITLE>
    <DATE>2018-12-20 09:19:00</DATE>
    <TEXT>I know Christmas and New Year are round the corner but if I don't start now that means I'll put on another 4kg and hate myself even more. There really is no time like the present to start. It's summer here. I don't want to be in summer clothes. I put on weight gradually as an autoimmune disorder stopped my exercise then a miscarriage caused depression and over eating. Then pregnancy. Then post pregnancy which was way worse than pregnancy for me over indulging due to stress and tiredness. So now I'm 5ft3in. I'm 62kg. I hate my body. I drink too much and then next-day I eat crap. I should stick to 1200 Cals. I don't. I'm living with family where drinking and take aways are common so it's even harder. Help me with some motivation and tips please! I've lurked a while and feeling reassured there are no trolls Im here to seek some encouragement I occasionally do 16:8 but often lapse (normally when booze involved). I am mostly vegan. I try to do the Kayla sweat workouts when can and run 5k once a week. Thank you!</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Yes me too. I've realised nothing positive comes from me drinking. And in fact even if the night itself is ok it leaves me with anxiety and depression the day after. I'm trying to stop and finding I can't and that's scaring me. So I came here to see some tips. It's been 3 days since you posted. I hope it's going well.</TEXT>

    <DATE>2018-12-30 07:43:07</DATE>
    <TEXT>What a day to start. The day before NYE. But yeah why not. Another poster said that most unfortunate or unhappy things and nights that happen to them occur when drunk. That is true for me too. I think I remember a time drinking led to fun nights. It's been a long time since that happened though. Now it's just guilt and fear and anxiety. So I drink again and continue the cycle. I've a young son who needs to not have a mum who relies on wine and feels anxious because of it. I've stopped for days at a time. Feel great. Drink and think I can handle it now and then but it always turns into regular drinking again. So I know I need to quit for good or at least months / years to make a change. I am currently on holiday with the family. All of whom drink a lot, daily and encourage drinking. May be a mistake but I'm not going to tell them I'm stopping. Because I know they'd tell me I worry too much to just cut down etc. And I don't need to hear that. What I need to hear are the stories here. About how better life is without booze for those with an issue. And I'm scared of a sober NYE around drunk people. But I'm just trying to visualise a hangover guilt free NYD and a positive start to 2019. So I may use this space as a bit of an occasional diary. I'm doing this now because the urge to drink has been huge and I thought if I wrote down my feelings it would pass. And I think it has helped! Good luck to you all, especially with the silly night approaching!</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Gosh thank you for the support. I'm in bed. I did it! My first day alcohol free. And I feel really positive. I had bouts of anxiety but I know that's the overhang from weeks of drinking and If I keep going it will pass as I grow in real confidence not fake alcohol induced confidence. I will take it one day at a time. But at least I'm going to bed feeling excited about what I've achieved and wanting to do it again tomorrow instead of feeling as if I've missed out in some way.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I won't post every day! But it's new years Eve here and I'm so proud. I love champagne and I said no. And I feel fine about it. I've definitely eaten more junk food today in compensation but that's fine. My eating junk food never led to me being an ass to someone. It's a little lonely. I can't be bothered to sit outside in the chilly air. I find it hard to socialise without booze (am an introvert). But I'm happy with myself so I'm accepting the quiet time for now. Good luck for NYE everyone</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I really do want to stop. I see alcohol as a toxic drug. I'm addicted. I've not had a good drunk night in years as I get blind drunk and make an idiot of myself and put myself in harm's way push away those I'm close to. You know the score. Anyhow I stopped. I really thought i had. Got to 5 days had a couple. Did not get drunk. Stopped two weeks. Had a couple two nights in a row. Stopped. Had three nights off then had one tonight. Everyone else is continuing drinking I've gone to bed. I'm so cross I had one. My husband says don't worry it's just one. But it's where it begins. I've started to think of it like smoking. If I'd just had one cigarette he'd be horrified at the harm and risk. Why don't people see booze like that? And I'm living with people currently who love a drink. I think I've stopped the getting drunk bit. Or I have for now I know one here or there will eventually lead to old habits even if I'm keeping it to one for now. Any tips on how I stop the one drink here and there as I really want zero alcohol in my system.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I don't think the parents did it. I don't think doctors would accidentally overdose a child I don't think if they did accidentally overdose a child they'd be so composed as to then dispose of her body and stage an abduction and maintain that lie whilst the world watched on. I think if one or other of them did it by accident in a fit of temper the other parent wouldn't be able to cover whilst the world watched on. It's seriously sociopathic behaviour for someone to behave like that. I think weird timelines and behaviour is because the whole group were drinking and leaving their children unattended and they know how awful that looks and even worse when the worst does happen. Maybe they even have memory missing because of drink. And weird behaviour after may be from pure shame and horror at what's happened to the poor child. I don't know exactly what did happen whether it was a planned abduction or opportunistic but I do think that abduction is the more likely scenario</TEXT>

He protested his innocence and his daughter campaigned on his behalf and after all appeals lost he admitted it and told the police where the body was.

And a third party just out of the blue helped hide a child's body for no reason and kept the secret all this time? And agreed to this crime in minutes as they didn't have long to hide the body. Oh and Gerry and this third party knew just where to hide a child's body in a holiday location where it wouldn't be found for 13 years ...... And then Gerry came back and calmly ate dinner? I can't believe anyone thinks this is likely. This was their child. They loved her. You don't just calmly accept a child's accidental death and expertly execute the hiding of a body in record time such that several police investigations can't find her.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I get what you're saying but I do think this was different. The situations you're describing are older children running around playing. Who can have some awareness of things like stranger danger. The age of Madeline and the twins makes it negligent regardless of the times in my view. Because forget the risk of abduction there are just the usual risks. Baby's and toddlers can choke on their own vomit. They can wake having awful night terrors and not know what's going on. Goodness they could even fall out of bed and hurt themselves. They're helpless at the twins age and almost helpless at Maddy's age so it was highly irresponsible and negligent to leave them.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>The more serious the allegation the more cogent the evidence has to be. It is a most serious allegation that a parent murdered or caused the death of their child, staged an abduction, and disposed of their body. So there should be some cogent evidence to support that. The 3 things you've listed are so far from that as to be effectively useless. Who knows what any of is would do on discovering a child has gone missing. I'd like to think of grab the twins too. But In a split second she chose to run and scream for help. Evidence she did??!! God if that were evidence we should all be very scared. The dogs. Well I don't know enough but I believe they smell blood or death. In a rental car and appartment. Where hundreds of people have stayed. Does it prove the body or blood of Maddy was there? Nope. And certainly would lead to more questions of how they hid and moved a body with the world watching and apparently a suspicious police force. The twins sleeping. Yep well babies can be surprisingly excellent sleepers. And if people were coming and going and they were still asleep then there are more people than the parents who can attest to that. And checking on their breathing??!! Every parent does that. My boy is nearly 2 and every time I check on him whilst he's asleep I look to see he's breathing!! Not evidence I'm afraid. I really just think that a nasty conspiracy theory has been put out there and now people are trying to bend evidence to fit that. you have to look at the evidence and where it leads you not the other way around. And really none of the three things you've mentioned, If for you it is just those 3 things, can seriously lead a sane person to conclude that therefore these otherwise good parents murdered or caused the death of their child, covered it up, hid the body, buried it somewhere no one has ever found it, and have carried on the charade for years perhaps even roping in some friends along the way. Because of how she reacted in the first seconds of discovery? And because a dog smelled blood but can't tell us whose blood or when it was left there...</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Many people could have hidden the body sure But that's my point. How many people do we need to believe would be cold blooded enough to cover up the death of a child to pull off this theory? No of course no one was under lock and key. But the McCanns weren't alone for any period of time. I remember watching this all unfold and the hundreds of press being camped outside where they were staying photographing and videoing them whenever they stepped outside. They were interviewed by press by police by British officials. So much was going on. I honestly can't see how anyone could sneak a dead body out into a rental car and hide it so well with no one noticing. What's the point in considering hypothetical??!! There was no blood found.....</TEXT>

    <TEXT>So here it goes. Today weighed in at 62.3kg Short story is used to be size 12-14 at 5ft 2in since a teenager. Found myself in my late 20s and managed to sustain a size 8 through exercise and healthy eating and it felt easy. Lost myself after miscarriage and then successful pregnancy and breastfeeding and sleep deprivation. Son is now nearly 2 and it's time to stop kidding myself. The baby weight was put on by overeating and has stayed on by overeating. I'd guess I easily consume 1600 a day on a good day and 2500 on a bad day. Taking that into account it's a miracle I've stayed the same 61-63kg for the past 12 months! But truth is I'm not happy or comfortable in my weight now. I'm a size 12 and would like to be a slim size 10 (fairly sure the size 8s are behind me now I'm 37). I want to be fit again too. So I'm signing up for the tough mudder and 10k runs to have a fitness goal. And I'm doing 5-2. Today was my first day. It was surprisingly not as hard as I thought it would be. It wasn't easy either! I had no breakfast or lunch (just some soya milk in tea) and some dinner to come in at under 500cals. I'm posting I guess to prove to myself its time to commit. I've lurked for a while. Every single one of you who has posted inspires me. I hope to inspire people too over the coming weeks and months. Live happily and healthily good people of Reddit!</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Well yes i guess i am. Based on my understanding that epstein had already been convicted once in 2008 and that it was an 'open secret' much like Saville and Weinstein (and illustrated by Trumps remarks 15 years ago). I don't know when the Groening thing was meant to have happened. Now I totally accept Groening may not have known but I'm starting from the point that there are questions for him to answer given a lot of people who chose to associate with Epstein did know. And the point I'm making is that even if it was only a foot rub if he did have knowledge or suspicions of what was going on then it is not 'just' a foot rub. Context matters</TEXT>

So I'm aware that thinking I'm ok now is a false narrative. What other tricks will my brain play and what can i.do to prepare? What other withdrawals will I experience (the nightmares and disturbed sleep are awful) and what benefits as I go forward (the stabilised mood is a positive one so far).</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Such a good way to look at it. I would never do drugs and find it so odd when people do . Some of my friends smoke and I just think why would you later your mind that way. Will really help me to view alcohol the same way. And really isn't it interesting that all the advertising works and they really do have people seeing alcohol as a good thing and not an addictive substance</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Just checking in as I'm finding it helpful to hold myself accountable. I feel quite strong and determined still. I've replaced booze with sugar and food generally which isn't great but I'm giving myself a pass for the moment. My SO had work drinks yesterday and I don't feel jealous. Just sorry for the hangover he will have today. God I'm so glad not to have one of those. Usually if he were out I'd polish off most of a bottle of wine watching crap tv. Instead I watched a documentary drama thing and practised the piano. Still struggling with sleep. Up at 4.30 am again. I guess that's all. IWNDWYT!</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I've recently moved to Australia from UK and I really like the health system here. I think the extr ass top ups by people help make the system better too. GP appointments same day, and absolutely excellent healthcare. I saw one GP here who is also from UK. I rushed through telling her what I needed (a repeat prescription) and she chatted and asked questions. I got my script and started to leave and she said "where are you going" I was like I've had my 10 mins so don't want to keep you. She understood because it reminded her of how under pressure UK GPs are And she said no lets talk some more I think I should refer to a couple of specialists for these things you've been taking meds for for years to check it all out. I was blown away!</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Beautiful evening. Friday night. Someone suggests a drink. For a fleeting moment I think it's been 13 days. Just for a moment. No. It isn't worth it. It won't be one drink. I'm doing the "and then" exercise I read on here before. One drink. And then A second drink. And then Come home and open a bottle. And then I put my child to bed and kiss him goodnight with alcohol on my breathe. And then I have more drink. By now I'm drunk. I start to get argumentative and don't make much sense. And then I go to bed annoyed with myself and the world. And then I have an even worse nights sleep than the sober insomnia I'm currently going through. And then Tomorrow I hate myself. I have increased anxiety and depression. I don't want to see anyone. Wow. Yeah that's convinced me. Not even one. IWNDWYT</TEXT>

One thing constantly happening to me the last few months of drinking was a scalloped tongue. It hurt so bad I thought I had tongue cancer. It got to a stage where I just thought I don't want that.

I'm feeling unwell and it may be partly anxiety driven. Almost certainly is actually. So now it's on to stage 2 so I can beat the anxiety and not let it convince me drinking is an answer or the answer. I've downloaded a meditation app. I'll restart calorie counting and exercise. Fitting these things in should now be easier without booze throwing me off. I've let myself go for the past 2 weeks to ease some of the feeling of missing out but now I want to start feeling the more positive benefits of this sober life. IWNDWYT</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Drinking crept in again with my baby. Mainly because you're stuck in the house so instead of going out for drinks it was have a bottle in. Then two or whatever. And it's a grown up time when youve been on own with your baby all day. So you're VERY wise to be alive to the possibility of drinking creeping back in. And people will say yay you can have a drink to celebrate now. You can have one whilst breastfeeding etc. It happens. Lots of mum's groups in my areas met for pub lunches. I think be as prepared as you can by reading books as recommended and discussing your decision with SO.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Sorry couldn't figure out how to post image and text! Haha. This first happened 4 years ago. I had a coupke.of spinal injection s then. They hurt but I guess it helped. I'm trying to do running and stuff again and Surprise surprise hurts again! Same disc. From memory it looks worse but ive changed country so dont have access to the old scan. The doc said it's my choice whether to have a spinal injection. It.may help. I'm not in agony any more but my movement is limited and I can't pick my son up and stuff. I tried tramadol and the pain went but I thought I was dying from the sickness and dizziness. An injection would help get me.over the worst right and enable me to start physio? I just don't even know where to start with the pros and cons here so any wisdom appreciated!</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I'm curious.... most of my reading suggests surgery has only marginally better results than conservative measures. But anecdotally I've read a few comments on here and other forums which are really pro surgery. I know everyone is different but can people share their own experiences? Specifically has anyone struggled for years and then had surgery? Did it help in the end? I'm in a pickle because whilst I can live with it I don't want to live with it. I want to run again. I want to be able to pick up my son when he asks. I want to do my aerobics and weights classes. For the past 4 years every time I try and get back into fitness I fail because of my damn back and whilst it's fine most often if I don't do these things, I want to do these things! I'm only 37 I don't feel aerobic exercise should be beyond me. And yes I know swimming is an option.... I just don't like it very much! If it's relevant it a a herniated l5-s1. All the other discs seem a-ok and my health is otherwise good.</TEXT>

I'll come on to say why I'm tempted and why I won't drink. Because of the things that will happen. For example I will have one drink AND then I'll have another AND then I'll start to get tipsy AND then so on and so on and play the decision forward. Usually for me it ends with being an idiot not remembering the night sleeping badly feeling sick and then depressed and anxious. By the time I've written it out the urge has gone. Others here can talk about groups and things. I don't attend any so can't help with that</TEXT>

    <DATE>2019-09-10 12:48:18</DATE>
    <TEXT>I had them 4 years ago when I first did this and I was in significant pain then. This time round the pain is slowly easing. I can move around but it hurts to sit for pronged periods. Can't lift anything heavy including my son. My big hurts. The more I do the more pins and needles I get in foot and my butt cheek. Not pain but sensations that I shouldn't be feeling. Currently as I lay in bed burning feeling in the hip. Should I still have the injection? I figure the steroid will help these remaining symptoms clear up and enable me to get started on the clinical Pilates I've been recommended to try. But not sure if it's not really suitable when I'm no longer in agony. I've had to stop taking oral anti inflammatory as I was getting bad stomach cramps and headaches Not sure what to do.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>A fellow shorty beating myself up for 1550 calories today. I try to stick to 1200 and am hungry and at a weekend go crazy as I can't stick it. And what I recently discovered when I forced myself to log every little thing I had on a bad day was I blew calories out of the water. I easily ate the 3500 calories I may have saved in the week. So I figure if I stick to 1600 a day EVERY DAY I'll.probably be better off. So my current aim is between 1200 and 1600 daily as I think I'll still be in a calorie deficit and will have a slow loss. Which is fine. I've been the same weight since giving birth (after initial loss) so I'll take a gradual loss over no loss at this stage!</TEXT>

    <DATE>2019-09-29 05:07:16</DATE>
    <TEXT>Really brief but will give more detail if needed. But I think sufferers will know what I mean. I had bad pack pain starting 4 years ago and episodes of memorable pain 2 years ago 6 months ago and 1 month ago. Since the 4 years ago one I've had almost constant weak left leg and an ineffective glute muscle. I say almost constant I'll get weeks of being normal where theeg works and i can do stuff again. Then i cant. Probably i overdo it but when the leg isnt weak nothing in my body says im pushing it. The back pain episodes often start with leg and knee pain before a couple of hours later the back is agony. In between back being agony as I say my left leg is weak and my it band tight as hell. If I release the tightness my back hurts again. When the back is bad I also have numb big toe tight feeling around the ankle shin pain and my butt aches. MRI show bulge l5-s1 scan previously posted. So my question....... How can you tell if it's the weak leg causing the back pain. Or the disc causing the weak leg? Several physio insist if they can get my glute firing again all Will be well. But I feel I can get my glute firing until something interrupts it again. Like I don't feel the glute is just weak and needs strength I feel.something is stopping it.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I always thought he was guilty. I remember debating it with people at the time and couldn't believe they didn't. Maybe because I'm legally trained but I just smelled bs from the off. From memory my thoughts were You don't forget details from the day your ex girlfriend went missing and the police called you. You don't lend your car and new mobile to a sort of acquaintance let alone a friend as a teenager. You don't not try and contact your ex girlfriend when they are first missing to see if maybe she has run away and will trust you with where she is. Adnan and Jay are totally linked on the day in question and Jay was lying to cover his butt and mimimise his involvement so he got off with a lighter sentence. Adnan had motive and seemingly created an opportunity asking for a lift home and involving Jay And then added to all these things the phone records and other bits it looked to me like he was guilty. I also remember wondering was that enough to covinct beyond reasonable doubt? Well the jurors thought so and they heard all the evidence and saw the witnesses demeanour and decided yes it was. Now of course lots of documents have been released and the court has had a lot of opportunity to look at it and uphold guilt. U/Justwonderinif has done great work getting all the docs released.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Hi I'm a parent to a beautiful 27 month old. And I'm falling into the trap of doing all the things I shouldn't be doing. I'm losing my temper, giving in to tantrums, and running out of ideas on how to be a better parent. I've always found ready a good, practical book a good start in doing things better. Any recommendations? There are so many! A summary of some of the problems: - won't brush his teeth properly or let me do it - asking for the toilet 4/5 times after going to bed as a pretense to get up - screaming and crying if I don't lay on his floor when he goes to bed. Taking an hour of crying and me going in and out to settle. If i do stay still not sleeping but making demands like blanket no blanket lullabies no lullabies water no water..... - deliberately throwing things he shouldn't throw - touching things he shouldn't touch (currently the Xmas tree) This makes him sound naughty. He isnt. Hes wonderfully loving and clever and independent and I know all of these things are normal behaviour and him growing and expressing he just wants me with him at night as well as wanting independence. But equally he needs help learning to settle to sleep and manage emotions and demands. So yeah- hit me with any resources that helped you!</TEXT>

It was one of those I walked away whilst they tried to talk to me because drunk = no filter. I instantly apologised. They wouldn't accept it. They also were drunk. But they are my boss. And probably when I was walking away I looked really fed up and eye rolling and awful but like 30 secs later I can't remember that. So actually not the worst thing ive done when drunk but also the big reason I want booze to stop. Sigh. Im trying to find a group.locally. Not AA. I thought there were some Buddhist run groups but can't find it now. I've found an onlne SMART group to join tomorrow night.</TEXT>

    <TITLE>How are we all feeling about Xmas and New year?</TITLE>
    <DATE>2019-12-15 10:36:53</DATE>
    <TEXT>Any tips and tricks to help me get through. I'm back on day 8 and I don't want Xmas to be the excuse to relapse but feel I need some plan or coping mechanism. My father in laws house is booze central. No one eats breakfast it starts with champagne. Then egg nog. Then aged wine for lunch. Then more wine and more wine. Until the brandy comes out. You get the picture. New year is similar. I think I can do it. Right now my resolve is high. But I am worried as I start to relax for the holidays...... So I thought maybe we could all share some tips and tricks. I've found some non alcoholic cocktail recipes to try so I've always got a yummy drink to try.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Thanks all. Unfortunately not going isn't an option. We stay for a week as family are put in the country so not going means hubby and son don't see any family at Xmas which isn't fair on them. Iys so true that once people are drunk the appeal lessens for me even in these early stages. So I guess the danger times are the first hour or two before everyone starts to show drunkenness. So I'll take time out if needed have yummy snacks and excuse myself for an hour or two. I will definitely try and focus on cooking and maybe I can take the kids all to the park or something during those danger hours.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Well done for getting sober at Xmas. It's hard but I don't want it to be my excuse so I'm going to try. Unfortunately abesenting myself would be difficult as we stay for a week and without going we won't see family for Xmas. My sober app just told me this The first step towards success is taken when you refuse to be a captive of the environment in which you first find yourself I think it will be a mantra. Yes I'm there yes there is booze but I am.not a captive of it.</TEXT>

    <TITLE>Talking to my 15 year old sister In law about alcohol</TITLE>
    <DATE>2019-12-17 19:26:04</DATE>
    <TEXT>It was enlightening and depressing at the same time. She's started trying drinks and has been drunk at least once I know of. Her parents both drink a lot as do all of us around her. I just spoke with her honestly about it. I told her I wish I'd never started. I told her it's not really led anywhere good. Sure there have been some "fun" nights but when you look back there's been many more bad nights, hangovers and consequences which far outweigh the fun. And that's for everyone who thinks they handle alcohol well because even they get hangovers low productivity and harm their bodies. I told her you wouldn't smoke as it's dangerous and addictive. Alcohol is the same save it's not yet spoken of that way in society. She acknowledged it all. She's seen the harm it does to her parents. But said it's hard as all her friends drink and it's basically down to peer pressure. A lot of FOMO going on. I told her about this forum and all the younger folk on here already making a positive decision to stop at aged 18 onwards and that stats show lots of teenagers aren't drinking now and she could be one of those. I felt for her and I remember exactly what it was like. Planning weekends by who could sneak the alcohol and drinking and feeling grown up. If only they could understand where it could lead. Anyway I told her I'm trying to stop and I'm hoping it will strengthen my resolution not to drink over Christmas to be an example to her of fun without alcohol. And in fact be more fun than all those getting drunk around us!</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Ha thanks. I didn't want to lecture her or tell her not to experiment because it is her journey but I thought there was no harm in being honest about where I am right now. And I was honest and said you know I may slip up and drink over Christmas. And that's ok and that's the addiction. But I'd like to stop.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>So getting into the family Christmas and so far I've resisted. I'm quite proud of myself. There is a lot of booze around and I'm having water, tea and two fake beers. Last night was tough. I had strong cravings but resisted. And when I smelt my husband's alcohol breath in the middle of the night (Sorry darling I love you) my first thought was thank goodness I didn't drink as that smell reminded me of how alcohol feels to me. Not that smell when it's a fresh poured glass of wine but that smell when it's metabolising and you're dehydrated and have a headache and anxiety and are dreading the morning. So I feel confident I can go a couple more days and the next challenge is Christmas day itself. IWNDWYT</TEXT>

    <TITLE>New type of pain in leg</TITLE>
    <DATE>2020-02-10 04:51:45</DATE>
    <TEXT>Usually my back pain ( from degenerated and mild herniated disc l5-s1) causes left glute weakness and pain down back of leg I.e. sciatica. Ive been following strengthening programme and been doing great (kieser for anyone interested). Started couch to 5k as feeling so good. Week 4 and leg pain. but it's down the front thigh. Worse when going upstairs or putting weight on it suddenly such as standing up from sitting. So it isnt sciatic. I guess just wondering if anyone here has referred pain from back to the front of their leg?</TEXT>

    <TEXT>When I was 8 I was cycling down a country road in Essex to return to a farm. My 18 year old cousin was a bit behind me walking our old shared horse. I went ahead being a kid wanting to go faster. A car drove by me and around a couple of bends it was pulled into a layby with the man stood out of the car. He stopped me and asked me if I knew anything about engines. I stopped and said i didn't. He sort of sighed and rubbed his chin looking about as if he didnt know what to do. He took his shirt off and then his trousers and stood there entirely naked acting normal and just distressed about his car. I froze. Then I think he heard the horses hooves. He took a step towards me and I sped off and screamed at him to f off. He chucked his clothes in the car jumped in and sped off past me just as I was turning left into the farm. My mum pulled into the farm moments later (maybe actually he heard her car?) And I was crying and shaking. Even at 8 i knew it was bad but only as an adult did I realise the full extent. As an adult i read a criminology book and it described the crimes of Robert black. He is reported to have said to one of his attempted victims do you know about engines pretending his car had broken down. I had chills reading it and horrid flash backs. I was on a tube at a time. I reached out to the author who confirmed black was a driver in the south east area at the time. This was about 8 months before his arrest. I'll never know if it was him or a coincidence but that's my almost kidnapped story</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Yep. I'm not sending him in. He actually has a slight cold so that's helped make my decision this week but next week when he's better if it's still open. I mean i want him there. It's better for him than being stuck here with us working not able to stimulate him in the way his peers do. We also have to pay the next months fees on the 1st. It hurts but I'm trying to remind myself it's keeping people employed for now. I had heard they were going to relax the 42 days absence for losing the subsidy so hopefully that's true. If it isn't we will have to send him in despite it all.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I'm not doing great in iso. I've managed 7 days off max. Haven't reset my counter so ignore that! But anyway last night at the shops I thought about getting the wine. Just "in case". But that was a trick. The in case meant of course i would drink. So I just didn't get the wine. Then I couldn't be tempted. And I enjoyed my night. And as I went to bed i remember reading on here someone say you will never regret not drinking. So true and has spurred me to actually try again iso or not. And I wanted to post in case that helps anyone today /tonight. Get through one more day. You won't regret it. IWNDWYT</TEXT>

    <TEXT>For a long time I have wanted to quit drinking. I don't even like drinking any more. It always ramps my anxiety and depression up, even with just one or two drinks. So I've started to try and face some of the root causes. I saw a doctor. I told her everything. And now I'm on mild anti depressants. I can't drink on them anyway. And I feel like this was a big move for me in the right direction. And soon ill start talk therapy too. I don't know if this is appropriate for this sub but I guess I'm sharing as quitting drinking (or trying) for me has helped highlighted there are some deeper issues going on that I need to deal with.

    <TEXT>I love this post. I constantly shake my head at how I'm still drinking when it does zero good for me. And I do have sciatica and an auto immune condition so inflammation is terrible for me. And I always mean how I'm in too much pain to exercise. So your words have given me an extra boost today as I head into a weekend with boozy relatives. Thank you.IWNDWYT</TEXT>

    <TITLE>Best decision I've made</TITLE>
    <DATE>2020-06-18 21:43:20</DATE>
    <TEXT>I guess I just want to share that I'm so relieved and happy I finally made the decision to try anti depressants for my PND. I've had underlying tendency to depression throughout my life but always been very well managed with lifestyle and talking therapy if needed. Then had a miscarriage, a pregnancy again 3 months later and birth and I guess it just was the thing that ignited the depression. about 6 months after my son was born I wasn't crying every day or utterly miserable so I thought I was over the depression and was just tired and demotivated and snappy because parenting is hard. My son is nearly 3. Being in isolation and working from home has given me a lot of time to reflect and I noticed how bad my intrusive thoughts were, how bad my sleep was, my constant fatigue, inability to follow through on good choices that I wanted like healthy eating and exercise. So I saw my dr and im on day 10 of prozac and I feel happy. Just actually happy and relaxed. Id forgotten what this was. Im exercising again. I've been able to stop drinking. I'm making better food choices. Concentrating at work. Is it too early to be the prozac? Is it just that ive made a positive decision and its a bit of placebo? I don't know. But I wanted to share this in case it helps anyone else who isn't sure whether to speak to their Dr.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Thats a bit more of an intense title than I mean it to be but I can't think how to ask this. Basically I started 10mg 3 weeks and by day 3 it was like a light switch being turned on. I've felt genuine happiness for the first time in years. I've lost my fatigue. I've slept well. Motivated. And today I'm just flat. And tired. And just want to got bed and not talk. We had a bit of an upset this morning (child managed to lock himself in a room - all safe eating crisps whilst we removed door handle but it shook me!). Could that be why? Or is this about the time people adjust anyway. Ive seen some people say the good effects wear off. Seeing Dr Tuesday anyway but guess I'm just curious. Thank you!</TEXT>

And now I feel like it's somehow worse than the first time around.

    <TEXT>I am a month in now and going strong. I had a job interview today. I think it didn't go great. But that isn't the point of the post. I was nervous. And then I had adrenalin. And excitement. And afterwards i wanted to cry. And some of my roller coaster emotions today were so strong. And it made me think about all the years I've spent numbing emotions through alcohol. Bad emotions. Feeling sad or depressed or bored or angry. Have a drink. Feeling happy and joyous and excited. Have a drink. It always ends the same way though. Hungover- anxious - regretful. As hard as it is to feel emotions sometimes, it is important to feel them and go through it. They pass - even without alcohol they pass. And for every negative emotion you numb with booze you numb positive one's too. I felt really alive today. Goodness me what a ramble. Not sure if it'll make sense to anyone.</TEXT>

ANA 1:1280 but negative for SLE Sjogren's etc. So concluded non specific connective tissue disorder put on hyroxychlorquine and sent on my way. 2019 new country drs say all blood work normal probably an isolated event. Stop hydroxychloroquine. 2020 sore throat 5 months. Fatigue is back. Mouth ulcers. ANA 1:320. I catch sons cold and now have a proper sore throat. Dr diagnoses strep throat and taking antibiotics 4 days in. Seeing rheumotologist Wednesday. But. I feel like I've been hit by a bus. Im tired I've got constant headaches im struggling to concentrate i feel so ill. Breathless if I walk too far. Nauseous. This isn't just the strep throat. So I guess my question is do normal infections make you feel so much worse if you've an underlying autoimmune condition or should i be seriously worrying about what the hell is wrong with me right now?

    <TEXT>I won a very nice bottle of wine a few months back in a wine quiz. We were saving it for a special occasion. Ive since quit the booze. Previously when I've quit, something like that bottle would be the "exception" to my sobriety. And I'd justify having a drink because its special or an occasion or a Saturday. And we know how that goes. Anyway I've decided that I'm giving it to my husband to enjoy on our anniversary next week. I don't feel even remotely tempted to try it. And this feels like a small win to me as it reveals to me how I feel different this time. This time I see this as permanent change to my way of life and no desire to go back to my old ways for any reason. Something has finally clicked for me. So don't worry if this is your 1000th day 1. I had many day 1s too. Keep having them because one day that day 1 will be the one that sticks and youll feel it.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I don't think they do have to pay their employees if they make them redundant. So consider a gym where lots of staff have just been laid off. Not open, no work, sack staff. Or furlough them whilst job keeper is available. The school cant just lay the teachers off as the children still need teaching albeit remotely. And so they are still working. I think the most could be argued for is a small discount based on some running costs may be being reduced..... Im with your wife on this one.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Its been a difficult week. Started my new role after getting a promotion whilst also caring for my son who is home due to covid and my husband who is waiting to hear if he needs an op. Well if this isn't an occasion to justify that glass of wine to help cope what is? I came here. I read some posts. I have come to the conclusion that this is NOT an occasion to justify that glass of wine. I'm going to be present for my son and husband who need me and do my best by my colleagues. None of that will be helped by a glass of wine. Thank you SD community. This is the first time I've felt like relapsing that I actually came here to read first instead of choosing to relapse and coming here with the guilt the next day. IWNDWYT</TEXT>

    <TEXT>But is it a problem if workers from the meat factories and hospitals stop by shopping malls etc on their way home from a potentially infected environment? It means the higher risk industries can bring it into the community. Id rather it was shut down and a focus put on how to minimise risk in those industries over the next 2-4 weeks (and minimise risk of hotel quarantine and poorly trained security guards!) than this real slow burn of a lockdown. Such as training, equipment, changed work practices where possible such as what we are now seeing in the aged care sector. Easy to be an armchair warrior I know.....</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Ive been doing remarkably well this attempt and this is the longest I have gone without drinking. I thought finally this is it! Then the past 3 days have been cravings from hell. I feel like i have thought about nothing but alcohol non stop. It coincided with stress (stage 4 lockdowns). I even said to my husband on day 3 of craving ive decided to just have a drink. I concluded I'd have one and I'd hate it and not sleep and it would kill the cravings. He told me he thought it was a mistake. So I resisted one more night. And then tonight I realised the cravings had passed. They passed once I accepted my situation for what it is and embrace the lock down positively. So this time I beat that battle. I know there will be more. But today IWNDWY</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Hi I hope this is an appropriate place to ask. I want to give an acknowledgement to country when I open a meeting and refer to the traditional lands of the people I live on. When I looked this up the info said the traditional owners have not been identified or agreed. I know I can give an acknowledgement to traditional owners without specifying but I almost feel I want to call out that this hasn't been agreed and its a further highlight of the ongoing impact of colonisation today. But it then feels somewhat inappropriate in an acknowledgement. Can anyone share their views? Thank you Edit: welcome to acknowledgement</TEXT>

    <TITLE>Bad dream and now flashbacks</TITLE>
    <DATE>2020-08-13 07:09:50</DATE>
    <TEXT>I had a bad dream last night which, as dreams do, shifted and changed shape. But it all centred around behaviour when drunk. Drunk texting and regretting it. Weird behaviour. Anxiety. Walking home drunk in the dark and lost. Not being able to drive in a crisis because I had had a drink. It was so weird to see that nightmare and all day I've just been haunted by it knowing this used to be my life. My birthdays and weekends and new years and holidays. All wrapped around this weird inebriated state which had a 50-50 chance of being the best or worst night ever. And then today it's caused me flash back memories of some of my most shameful drunk moments. Is this just my brain starting to process things. I've never stopped drinking this long and I'm finding it a bit unsettling!</TEXT>

This morning as I wake up hangover free and hes still in bed after drinking too much im so grateful I managed to resist. For me it was a combination of getting to 100 days having a few days off work and PMS (sorry for TMI!) But its good to identify the triggers for craving that old habit and chemical induced hit to be prepared for next time. IWNDWYT</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I was told by a colleague police attended bunnings in her area fining anyone doing click and collect for non essential items. So I just called my local bunnings to ask as I was hoping to keep myself busy this weekend doing stuff in garden. I was told police had also been doing such checks there. I guess it is outside the rules i get it. But at the same time it feels heavy handed when it is contactless click and collect very low risk and helps people keep their minds and body active with something positive. I can walk down the shop and into the shop for alcohol as essential but not get gardening stuff for my mental health contactless. There is a line and on this occasion im the wrong side of it i guess</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I thought it may be the 5km thing too but I specifically asked if it was non essential and they said yes. I just checked dhhs website and it says "shopping for food or other essential items". Click and collect is for essential items. I thought i read somewhere one summary that click and collect for non essential is in the second or third step.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Hello. Im Donna originally from London now in Melbourne Australia. Im F 38 yrs. Married one child aged 3. Been between 61-63 kg basically since I had my son. Want to be 53kg ultimately and get my fitness and muscles back. I dont know why ive been fundamentally unable to shift weight. I mean i know why. I eat more than I need. But I also don't know why i can't stick to losing. I've got down to 58kg and within days shot back to 61kg. Lockdowns don't help! Gave up the booze 3 months ago. Best decision I've ever made. Weight still not shifted. Gave up gluten on gp advice too 5 weeks ago So here it goes. This is a great time for a challenge taking me into summer and giving me a renewed focus. Im really looking forward to getting to know y'all and work out how to participate fully on discord!</TEXT>

    <TEXT>The best way is to forgive yourself and earn the trust of others back by trying to stop. And you are because you are here. I still feel shame for what I've done but so much less now I know I've actually stopped drinking. Because now the shame is followed by a thought that "thank goodness I won't do that again" rather than fear that "i wonder when I will be like that again" If there is any possibility of me behaving like I used to when I got drunk then any decision to drink is like playing Russian roulette. May get happy dancing me. May get angry depressed dangerous me.</TEXT>

I was taking it in the morning and by the afternoon would feel sick and have awful headaches. Yesterday I took it before bed and that seems better. Still a bit rough this afternoon but bearable. Not quite at the bit of my cycle yet that I'd be struggling with PMDD so not sure about that. How are you doing?</TEXT>

I think that just means you have a really good working empathetic streak. Its natural to have that automatic feeling. But it helped me to remind myself he doesn't have normal human reactions nor care about any harm he inflicts on others. Any twinge of sympathy soon vanished :-)</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I dont even know if GERD is what I have but symptoms seem to suggest it. Seeing GI on 13th October. My query is can nausea and headache in the afternoons be GERD related or may that be something else. Im not sure I've seen them as obvious symptoms. Ive debated not eating to see if I still get this in afternoon. Other symptoms have been unexplained sore throat since Feb. Sometimes a feeling of lump in my throat. Burping more. Sometimes burp tasting alcoholic (I don't drink). Stomach pain if I eat too early in morning. More frequent bowel movements but not loose stools. Feeling bloated. Thanks in advance!</TEXT>

    <TEXT>So over it this weekend. We are lucky in that no financial stress and child can go to day care. But even so its a mental toll. Its been months. Constantly saying to little one we can't see nanna we can't see grandpa we can't go to the zoo etc. My back is killing me but I can't swim for relief as no pool within my 5km. I just feel limited hope. I think you have one chance maybe two to get down to 0. Like NZ or the other states. You go hard and early. It is not sustainable to keep everyone in limbo for months to get to 0 when it's obvious it can be lost in a heartbeat. Im not anti lockdown. For sure keep lots of rules in place. But it needs easing to a more sustainable level economically and for mental health whilst keeping infections and death as low as possible. I also think it doesn't take into account that we've learned a lot now about tracing and about treatment which we didn't know back in March. Just a whinge. Big sighs.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Interested that you say its the worst thing you can do. I have weird unspecified autoimmune issues and recently one dr found i had a celiac gene so told me to just cut gluten. I did and have been quite diligent but started to get lots of heartburn. Saw a GI who is going to do an endoscopy but said let's test properly for celiac too so high gluten diet for 4 weeks first. So after 8 weeks no gluten ive now had gluten for 3 days and im suffering bad. Migraines bloat upset stomach lack of concentration fatigue. Much worse than when I ate gluten before. Is it worse to stop and start then?</TEXT>

I have a chronic sore throat condition from gerd and autoimmune issues. I want another one to be sure im doing the right thing. People are debating me saying that doesn't mean I have to isolate and im trying to find more to support my case - I.e. even if you think its wrong would you be prepared to pay x fine.. So all of you miserable fucks that automatically downvote a simple question trying to find out the LAW, and assuming the worst of me - seriously you need to question what that says about you.</TEXT>

    <DATE>2020-10-19 10:39:52</DATE>
    <TEXT>Hey all I was originally told stop eating gluten as you may be celiac (have the gene and some unexplained autoimmune things). I did. Then gastro issues continued so new dr says eat gluten 4 weeks as if we are doing gastroscopy anyway want to rule celiac in or out. Well let's say resuming gluten has been hell. Way worse than when I gave it up. Ive heard the biopsy isn't always 100%. And I've read different things on how much gluten I should be eating these 4 weeks. My dr said 2 bits of toast a day. So I already am miserable. I dont want to be miserable and inconclusive because I didn't eat enough gluten. Does anyone have any knowledge of current research to support how much gluten is enough gluten or is it really variable? Or does anyone have any info about % of false negatives on biopsy? Thanks. I guess I'm just wanting to make sure these 4 weeks of D amp;V give me the answers!!</TEXT>
