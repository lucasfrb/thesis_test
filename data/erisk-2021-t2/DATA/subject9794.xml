    <TITLE>First time dropping alone</TITLE>
    <DATE>2016-02-03 15:19:55</DATE>
    <TEXT>Hey guys, someone I know with decent experience with psychedelic drugs called me today and told me he was planning to drop while alone. He asked if I could recommend any particular activities while high. This friend wants to explore the "inside" aspect of the high, hence the dropping all by himself. Thank you kind people, stay safe  lt;3</TEXT>

    <TITLE>Playing Dust2 only</TITLE>
    <DATE>2017-02-06 11:34:17</DATE>
    <TEXT>Hello, I started playing CSGO about 4 months ago. Out of all the maps I only know Dust2. My question is, how is this affecting me? I am at Gold Nova 2 at the moment, and slowly rising. Since they removed Dust2 from Active Duty I started asking myself if I'm actually wasting my time on an imbalanced map, and whether I should learn other maps as well. I would like to hear what people with more experience think about playing Dust2 only and how critical is it? Thank you :)</TEXT>

    <TEXT>One of the reasons why I refrained from learning new maps is the tactical smokes/flashes. I felt like learning new smokes is such a hassle. Do you think that knowing smokes is critical at low level (Gold2)?</TEXT>

    <TITLE>Vaporesso Tarot Mini Spitting like crazy</TITLE>
    <DATE>2017-09-19 12:10:49</DATE>
    <TEXT>Hey guys, yesterday I got me a Tarot Mini, and it's a really horrible experience vaping on it. I'm using the tank and the coil that come with the kit, but every time I take a drag I get a spray in my mouth, totally unbearable taste. I read around but no suggestion seems to apply to my case. The coils are ideal for 40W-50W and I'm vaping at ~45W. What else could it be?! ==EDIT== I found a hack that reduces the amount of spit dramatically. I simple press the button half a second before I rip, it seems like in the first half a second there isn't enough heat so I'm getting these spits. Would like to hear suggestions/personal experiences. Thank you so much!</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Hey, I will keep it short: * My friend has always had house plants and they always had Gnats in them, but she thought they were "flies/mosquitos" that are attracted to watery soil. * She recently started a microgrowery and noticed that the soil of the special plant has tons of these (at any given moment one can notice 2-3 of these on the surface). * She tried to google how to fix these, but blogs/guides on first page of Google try to sell you Amazon products (affliates), so she feels she can't trust these sites because surely they are trying to over-sell and are probably offering products that are not 100% necessary. * For example take a look at this ["guide"](https://www.growweedeasy.com/cannabis-plant-problems/fungus-gnats) and see how it suggests like 10 different things to buy. **But which out of these are enough?** How would you advice this friend of mine? She is getting concerned. Thank you  lt;3</TEXT>

    <TITLE>Is it a myth that different 'types of acid' produce different 'visuals'</TITLE>
    <DATE>2019-09-22 20:02:22</DATE>
    <TEXT>5 years ago I celebrated my birthday with friends and as usual we took acid. A couple of friends then said '***Ah this acid isn't visual'***. And ever since then I lived under the impression that some types of acid don't produce visual 'effects' (I don't call these hallucinations), while others did. Today, being more edumicated and all that, I know that acid is LSD-25, and it doesn't matter how pure your crystal is as long as you weigh how much LSD is in each tab you should always be taking the same stuff (ignoring the weight of the impurities). So what is it then? Why is it that sometimes I take an advertised 200ug and barely see any visual changes but I still feel loaded while other times I take 150ug and have my reality visually replaced? **Is it just the dosage and dealers are mis-advertising it?** Because I have Ehrlich reagent tested every acid tab I've taken and they all reacted purple. **Let's say a blotter reacted as LSD in Ehrlich, does this guarantee that it's LSD?** If yes, then it's probably dosage. I would love to hear your edumicated input Tenks : gt;</TEXT>

    <DATE>2020-02-06 09:23:17</DATE>
    <TEXT>A couple of months back I decided to invest an extra $3k I have by purchasing VOO. I'm also receiving ESPP shares from work (CHKP), currently have around $16k. I feel like I should diversify and not hold so much CHKP, so I want to sell around $6k of them in favor of some ETF or a long term stock. From reading around, some possible moves I can make that appeal to me are: (or a combination of those) 1) Tech ETF (maybe QQQ) 2) High dividend ETF 3) MSFT 4) more VOO Would like to hear your opinions and possibly saving me from making a mistake.

    <TEXT>Some valid counter points: - It is not farfetched for IOF spokespeople to lie a cover story in order to avoid taking responsibility and prosecuting their own soldiers. So I'll wait to see the security videos of them planting these explosives before I count this as a fact. - The term Islamic Jihadi is problematic and obviously contributes to dehumanization, especially because by Israeli standards 99.999% of Gazans are Islamic Jihadis, and this obviously cannot be true because it dipicts Gaza as this concentration of pure Evil. - The power imbalance between the two sides is very clear, and it's okay to expect one of the most sophisticated armies in the world to be able to handle these kinds of situations (rock throwing and border crossing attempts) in less barbaric ways. - Israel doesn't need Palestinian bodies as bargaining chips, they already hold tens of thousands of prisoners that hold higher exchange value than a body.

But even if they were to point to a couple of fabrications they are still easily outnumbered by confirmed videos. But I haven't seen a video that's a set full of people acting a scene with the goal of creating a fake video that harms the "good name" of Israel. The question here was whether this video is of an Israeli unit, or was it a a bunch of gangsters kidnapping the son of a crime family head.</TEXT>

And during the early days they were complete savages (Etzel, Irgun etc). Known incident in Haifa pre1948 of a Jewish militia throwing incendiary barrel at a British outpost/base killing a dozen British officers. In the place that this happened in Haifa there is a monument now, glorifying the Jewish heroes that completed this operation. The early days are riddled with incidences like these. And since then the power of Israel has only grown, so I cannot see how you see it as the underdog.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Of course we can move forward. I was born and lived all my life in Israel and will be the first in line to get into a secular non-ethnic state. For me, what you wrote is just a way to excuse the occupation and the oppression that Palestinians live at this very moment.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I don't care about conspiracy theories. I'm not theorizing anything. You counted one incident where Palestinians persecuted Jews for holding hands in 1918 or something, but apart from that Jews were relatively accepted in Palestine compared to the rest of the world. So Palestinians can't be held accountable for the antisemitism Jews faced in Europe. Palestinians would've probably faced the same anti-Semitism were they living in Europe at the time. Jews facing annihilation in the intifadas is a joke really. Israel could've carpeted the entire Palestinian territories if they wanted. Regarding the other wars, you have a point, it is the most real existential threat that Israel faced and it's really sad that we had to get to these points. But I really feel that it was an inevitable consequence of occupying a land where people used to live. Remember that Arabs are also semites, so you can expect the same racism towards Arabs from white supremacists. It saddens me that we are debating who is more of an underdog, but maybe it needs to be done.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Sorry I attacked you, it was because your points were very Hasbara-esque, and it felt like I'm hearing a 17 year old Israeli boy talking. But I completely agree with you. There are a lot of neo-Nazis that are anti Israel. And if you are a smart Nazi, you will code your speech so that normal people won't discover your true identity. And instead of making anti-Jewish speech, you will code it with anti-zionism. Maybe this is the phenomenon you are referring to.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I wasn't aware that "sea glass" is a thing. But you are likely correct, some of the edges of the "rock" are still sharpish, and when I first saw it my instinct told me that it's the remains of a beer bottle (common green) but then the texture and lack of sharp edges made me doubt.  #8203; But yeah, after reading the Wiki of Sea Glass, it does make sense.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>In the past almost anybody from the former Soviet Union who requested to migrate to Israel on the basis of Jewish ancestry would be granted. Even if it's obviously a lie - some Russian immigrants in Israel still wear a Crucifix and celebrate Christmas. At some point Israel needed to throttle the amount of Eastern European immigrants so they started conducting these DNA tests. Funny thing is, if you were to conduct this DNA test on Palestinians, a nice chunk of them would show "Jewish ancestry" in their result (maybe around 20%-40%).</TEXT>
