I did it too, my head was so full of misinformation, and the final straw for me was when I saw a tweet with video of white phosphorus raining down on houses, with people claiming it was Israel doing it to some other country. Then I said what I thought was true on NL, and got called an anti semite, so I googled for a story about it and found nothing. I unfollowed everyone who retweeted misinformation and my Twitter experience got better, but Twitter is so fucking toxic, I just couldn't deal anymore after a while</TEXT>

    <TEXT>It's not complicated. Bethlehem and entirety of the Lehigh valley was in a terrible depression for years after bethlehem steel closed.

All the people who remain in coal country need to do is get up off their asses, stop moping around, make a plan and apply for aid. This isn't some "pull yourselves up by your boot straps" scenario, the country is providing a fucking hoist, all they need to do is grab hold of it.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>But that's not how it happened  gt;The county invested $11.5 million of bond funds for redevelopment in the area around the former steel facility. The bond funds were part of a larger $111 million bond initiative borrowed by the county for economic revitalization after the Bethlehem Steel closure.  gt;Additionally, the county provided tax incentives and created a tax incremental financing district with the City of Bethlehem and the Bethlehem Area School District, which will provide $11.5 million in tax revenue in deferred taxes generated from new business on the site.  gt;The first development on the land was Commerce Way, the roadway to the Lehigh Valley Industrial Park located on the end of the property. After this road opened, McClure said the state gave a substantial economic contribution to widen Route 412, the main road along the Bethlehem Steel facility.  gt;In 2004, revitalization efforts progressed when Bethworks Now, LLC was created to manage the land for redevelopment and led to the establishment of a casino, entertainment center, event center and hotel. These developments would preserve the blast furnaces.  gt;**After it was announced that a casino be moving to the area**, ArtsQuest, a nonprofit dedicated to cultural experiences and outreach programs, and PBS 39, a community-owned public media station, showed interest in building near the former steel facility. https://www.naco.org/articles/county-revitalization-leads-economic-comeback The casino was attracted to the area *because* of the revitalization, the casino didn't start the revitalization</TEXT>

Historically, Biblically. Maybe you wouldn #8217;t normally say this after... It #8217;s only safe to say this, sorry, after midnight... But, you know, a fly #8212;he who commands the fly has always been seen, historically, as a mark of the Devil. #8221;  gt;Host Ari Melber let out a big laugh at that point. Schmidt, however, did not. Perhaps because of that, the MSNBC newsman was led to ask his guest:  #8220;Steve, now, as a journalist, now I have to ask for the record, are you joking? Because, uh, the fly could have landed on anyone. #8221;  gt; #8220;But it didn #8217;t, #8221; Schmidt responded sharply.  #8220;It landed on Mike Pence, and it says something. Something karmic about the status of the campaign as it implodes. Look, you have a Fox News poll that has Biden up 10 points. Rasmussen #8217;s #160;got Biden #160;up 12. You #8217;re looking 12 to 14 points. The numbers are imploding, the campaign is cratering, it #8217;s falling apart. #8221;</TEXT>

If you wanna put vaseline and glitter on it so any idiot trying to steal it gets greasy and has glitter on them for days, that's fine, but you can not make it dangerous because that's illegal, specifically because city workers/first responders/kids can get hurt</TEXT>

    <TEXT>You. You would still vote Biden, and that's great. But there's plenty of people on the left who might get deflated by that kind of announcement, and there's definitely accelerationist who would seize on Biden's answer to call Democrats weak, trying to depress turnout BUT all of this as assuming he does not want to pack the courts, and I really don't think that's the case. He's been saying over and over again that republicans are trying to jam through ACB because they want to make protecting pre existing conditions unconstitutional. Everyone knows it's constitutional and more importantly, the overwhelming majority of Americans want pre existing conditions covered. If the despotic supreme court conservative majority dares to declare it unconstitutional, then packing the courts becomes the most popular stance a Democrat can take.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>It's been happening in NJ  amp; NY for ~6 months. I've yet to hear any issues. I don't think the type of sterotypes you propagate are helpful to society or the economy in any way.

Here's some great examples [A B.C. research project gave homeless people $7,500 each  #8212; the results were 'beautifully surprising'](https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/british-columbia/new-leaf-project-results-1.5752714) [More homeless people ditching shelters for campsites amid COVID-19 pandemic](https://www.leadertelegram.com/news/state/more-homeless-people-ditching-shelters-for-campsites-amid-covid-19-pandemic/article_44a93a08-2fb8-5de4-967e-3a544a5e44a5.html) That's from Michigan, not Canada, but the winters aren't much different.</TEXT>

And there's still not any issues with housing homeless in motels in NJ  amp; NY.
