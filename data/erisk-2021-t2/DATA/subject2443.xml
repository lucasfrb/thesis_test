    <TITLE>Advice or Guide for Smash 4 Ganondorf?</TITLE>
    <DATE>2016-02-12 04:51:11</DATE>
    <TEXT>I feel I have hit a skill ceiling with Ganondorf. While other characters have unique gimmicks and tactics, Ganondorf has... Side B? I have mained Ganon for a year and I think I have exhausted most of his options mainly because his character archetype isn't really meant for competitive play. The only guaranteed throw grab combo I have found myself is Down Throw to Down B, which really is for Mid-Heavy weights at 0-20% if they don't DI. I've held my own against a "fair" amount of Sheiks, but I seem to lose most of the time. I don't want to drop Ganondorf because he is fun to play, but it is frustrating you have to have little to no mistakes when playing as him. Any help would be great!</TEXT>

    <TEXT>My guess is that everyone was disbanded from the Smash Dev Team after 1.1.5, and the only reason they got back together was to specifically make this patch was due to an overwhelming demand for it. This sounds obvious, but I hope people's hopes don't get too high for another patch as there most likely won't be another one unless a game breaking glitch is discovered. It's been a wild ride, with all these patches and such. Too bad #BuffthePuff never happened.</TEXT>

    <TITLE>I just finished Xenoblade Chronicles.</TITLE>
    <DATE>2016-05-29 18:53:51</DATE>
    <TEXT>Xenoblade Chronicles is now one of my favorite games to exist period. First off was the story. This is the biggest reason I love this game. The plot was just so creative and unique. The game had a lot of plot twists, but the thing was, they were REALLY GOOD plot twists. I could not predict that spectacular ending.The story also takes no stops and treats the player maturely, having themes of betrayal, death, hope, friendship, free will, creation and destruction, nature v. technology, etc. Which I found to be really engaging! 2nd is the chatacters. Xenoblade's characters really flesh out this game. Each character feels like they could be someone in your life or have a personality of someone you know. My favorite character is Shulk, as throughout the story you can see him try to comprehend the powers of the Monado. I'm glad they didn't make him a silent protagonist because would have ruined the impact of Shulk's character. Did I mention the voice acting for each individual character is spot on? You can feel the emotion all the voice actors put into their lines, and like I said before, gave these characters a personality. 3rd is the music. Do I need to say anything else? The whole game is fully orchestrated I think, and almost no pieces in the game feel boring or painful to listen to. The music syncs perfectly to the dramatic parts of each cutscene, and makes everything you are doing have much weight and worth to it. There are so many good tracks that I can't decide which one was my favorite. The Main Theme though, is beautiful. My fourth and final point is the gameplay. Using the Monado in battle is a pretty unique mechanic that makes for some fun battles. The battle system is so deep and isnt watered down in any way, it is confusing and overwhelming when you first play the game though. The only other gripe I had with the game was the fact that it kinda lagged on at the later half of the game, and of course the inevitable RPG mechanic of level grinding. However these two factors did not detract from my overall enjoyment of Xenoblade Chronicles. I could go on for hours on why I love this game, but I wanted to keep this short and concise to the best of my ability. If it werent for Super Smash Bros I would never know about this masterpiece. I now see why people cite this as their favorite game of all time, as its now one of mine. TLDR: XC has a great story, characters, music, and gameplay.</TEXT>

    <TITLE>Would it we reasonable to lower the cooldown on Roadhog's hook?</TITLE>
    <DATE>2017-06-20 22:26:40</DATE>
    <TEXT>I know the latest patch just came out and it'll to take a few weeks to start to see any new character trends because of the buffs/nerfs. But I played PTR session a bit and I can say Roadhog is an awkward spot. His dependence on the Hook - gt; M1 combo in previous patches being changed makes his playstyle a lot different than before. Now he is more reliable on the frontline than as a flanker. We know the hook cooldown nerf came with Hook 3.0 so he couldn't pick people people off is fast, but now that he can barely kill squishies, his role has changed to stay with his teammates more. Now I don't know what is more beneficial to the game, old Hog or new Hog. But if Blizzard is trying to push new Hog he should at least get a shorter cooldown for his hook. Maybe Blizzard should revert it back to 6s. It would help Hog more in team situations and would revert the change made to him because of his previous one shot ability. Really I don't want Roadhog to go down to trash tier due to these new changes. By making a new playstyle for Hog, Blizzard needs to actively give players the right tools to match the desired playstyle if that is what they are going for. The current 8s cooldown on Roadhog doesn't do that.</TEXT>

Of course this could all most likely be due to the great handling of source material in the right hands, but I like to think it is something more than that. What do you guys think?</TEXT>

    <TITLE>What 3rd party character best represents the "spirit" of Nintendo?</TITLE>
    <DATE>2018-07-26 01:30:31</DATE>
    <TEXT>Games and connections to Nintendo aside, what 3rd party character do you think represents what Nintendo is to you and why? It can be different things, like presentation, personality, or even character design. For example: I think Pac Man kinda fits the bill for me design wise, because his character was created around a gameplay concept, not the other way around. Also he is very wacky and seems like a happy go lucky guy.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I find self fulfilling prophecies interesting since they are a dual edged sword. Some people say that just believing in something won't make it happen, yet believing in it does make it *closer* to reality since your beliefs influence your actions. This can be both good and bad for many reasons. What self fulfilling prophecies do you guys have?</TEXT>

    <TITLE>I just beat XBC2</TITLE>
    <DATE>2018-09-05 05:30:58</DATE>
    <TEXT>Being a big fan of XBC1, I bought the game like 9 months ago and really disliked the first 3-4 chapters since they hold your hand so much. I only put 20 or so hours in and moved on to other games. Then a week ago I found XBCX on sale for really cheap and became motivated to play XBC2 again. I'm surprised how fast my opinion changed on the game after the first 1/3 of it, I even bought the expansion pass. Really great story, characters, and gameplay! It's so cool how the game ties into the first game as well. Anyone have a similar experience? Also any recommendations for playing XBCX? I'm just starting on that one and am liking it so far.</TEXT>

Its so slimy when it mixes with the mayo and if you have that sandwich later in the day the lettuce is going to be wilted and even more gross. Also the lettuce is shredded so you get the texture of destroyed personal documents in your mouth as you try to savor the salty goodness of the McChicken patty.</TEXT>

It doesnt matter if its a candy bar or a set of new speakers, the clerk will always ask: "Hey man your purchase comes with a free copy of the nutshack" I'm sick of it. I got enough copies of the nutshack to make a real nut-shack out of nutshack copies. I tried watching it last year but it burned a physical hole through my dvd player. Due to all the copies the fire department has called my house a potential "fire hazard". Well ya know what? Im sick of it.

    <TITLE>The Tropical Beat Gum for the CTR promo is the worst gum I have ever had</TITLE>
    <DATE>2019-08-31 03:37:58</DATE>
    <TEXT>Sorry this is only tangentially related to Crash Bandicoot, but here it goes. Today I was at the store and decided to purchase some gum with the CTR code as a fun treat for myself. After a hearty meal, I decided to try the two flavors I bought, Spearmint Rush and Tropical Beat. The Spearmint was pretty good, a smooth gum reminiscent of an ocean crashing against the shore, a cool breeze on a summer afternoon, or laying down after a long day. I was satisfied with my purchase. Then I made a mistake. I foolishly tried the Tropical Beat. At first it tasted like your usual artificial tropical flavor, something that tries to recreate the feeling of a fruit punch in a sunny beach setting, but in a heartless way. It was after a few seconds this pleasant scene was metaphorically destroyed as tidal waves of bad flavor crashed on to my tongue. They were persistent- a feeling I can only describe as someone twisting a knife on my tastebuds, with no remorse in their eyes. I gagged a bit, as the horrid taste of the Tropical Beat masked the flavor of the Spearmint. I spit it out and shoved a fresh piece of Spearmint in my mouth. Memories of a relaxing summer shore came rushing back, but they were tainted, as if a storm had obscured the sky, and I could no longer feel the warmth of the sun. Word to the wise, don't chew the Tropical Beat.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Yeah judging the Mario games all together tends to be a very subjective topic and many of the reasons you listed why you prefer Odyssey is what makes me like Galaxy better in different ways -Mario's movement is dependent on gravity as well as your imput, and if down well in conjunction, can pull off some really fun situational moments -Galaxy has a hub world and the missions you do are always jammed pack with content. They have a great beginning, middle, and end and are like verses that make up the whole of SMG. Stars feel like actual rewards. -Galaxy builds up the hype over time, introducing set pieces and like I said before, each level having a structured way it guided you through it like a story. -I can name just as many moments in SMG that are iconic or epic as Odyssey. Peach's castle getting lifted in the sky, the Good Egg planet, fighting Bowser as epic choir music plays in the background, Gusty Garden Galaxy, literally everything about Rosalina, etc. While Odyssey has the edge a little bit in this department, the sweeping and magical atmosphere of Galaxy is consistent through the whole game and doesn't lose steam. But that's my take on it anyway. Overall I love Galaxy because it has no right to be a Mario game. But it elleviates itself by taking full advantage of its setting (exploring space) and embraces how cool Mario is (which to an extent could be said of Odyssey as well, I just think Galaxy does it better). Its cool this series has a consistent level of quality where we can't agree what is the the definitive game.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Reading posts like these always make me cringe because I know exactly the type of person you are playing against. It sucks so much fun out of the game when you gotta dumb down your gameplay just so someone doesn't get salty. Instead of trying to improve they use that time to make excuses. On the other side of the coin, maybe he just likes playing casually? A lot of people if not a majority think of Smash as a fun party game. However if this isn't the case and wants to be more competitive, he needs to change his fundamental mindset, which is easier for some people than others.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Thats what I like about it, compared to something like Borderlands which cracks jokes every 5 seconds. The writing in this game has a more satirical and realistic edge with enough dry humor for levity. For example, while Captain Hawthorne dying is played as a one off gag, as the story progresses you start to see the impact he had on the people of the colonies.</TEXT>

Stories of the past, of people before us doing their best to navigate this mysterious and daunting world. People underestimate how important it is to understand our context in the world, why the way we are, and why issues from 1000s of years ago still persist in our supposedly "civilized" society. Without it we would just repeat the mistakes of our past. By learning from our mistakes and building off of them, we can build a better future.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>The lack of a hub world really kill's Odyssey's charm for me. A really good hub world can make a difference in how connected a game feels imo. Even though Galaxy is my favorite 3D Mario and game of all time, Super Mario 64's hub world is practically unmatched. There is so much space for Mario to run, jump, and explore. The castle is very large, but fills its space with many secrets to reward those who keep looking. The castle is synonymous with SM64, its iconic. I really wish Odyssey had something similar, like maybe Mario's ship has a pocket dimension on the inside or something.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I think that's true to a point, but I feel it can be kind of moot at times. I grew up playing a lot of 2D Mario as well, with Super Mario World being one of my favorite games of all time. However I still prefer the 3D games because there is more substance and are generally more fun. Conversely I played a couple Zelda games before the original one, and the original one is in my top Zelda games list. Honestly I think it does vary from person to person on how much stake you put into nostalgia, but yeah I do have to admit our earliest memories tend to be our fondest.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Ganondorf is interesting. I use to main him in 4 so I get the struggle for people who want to use him seriously. You either got to play in the most boring way possible or be so aggressive the Ganondorf can't even react (chaining 4 fairs with Pac-Man against Ganondorf is evil but fun lol). Honestly Ganondorf is kind of one note. Once you get past the fear of dying to him he becomes a lot easier to play against.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I think you should try out/experiment with each fruit and see what situations you can use it in. When I first started playing Pac-Man, I would always charge key because I thought it was the strongest. Sadly its not lol. Each fruit has a different utility like the other guy said. Getting into the rhythm of what fruit to use, when to use it, and when to wait takes time and experience. One major thing Pac-Man struggles with is killing. You may be able to practice all these fancy set ups for days, but if you can't close out the stock its kind of a moot point. Don't be afraid to edgegaurd with Pac-Man, his Dair is really good at catching recoveries, and getting back to the stage is super easy due to how versatile Pac-Man's recovery options are.</TEXT>

His "get off me" tool seems to be Nair now, and his trampoline isn't Frame 1 anymore, but the improvements to his grab and charging of his fruit really go a long way into making him feel clean. I wish he had a little bit more kill power though.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>This is why I prefer Galaxy 1 over 2. Sure Galaxy 2 has better level designs, unique mechanics, and I guess is more "fun". However the atmosphere that pervades Galaxy 1 is lost in translation. Galaxy 2 is all the grandeur of Galaxy 1 amplified- without the calm and melancholic moments to balance it out. I would take Rosalina's Observatory over a big Mario head piloted by Grimace any day. I guess what I am trying to say is that Galaxy 1 really captures that essence of what space is. Its both daunting and beautiful at the same time. The endlessness of the stars is scary, but also comforting as there are limitless possibilities out there. Galaxy 1 was really the first game to me to convey how games really are an artform (sounds cliche I know). It's a masterpiece and my favorite game of all time.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>The Legend of Zelda shockingly. I get why we don't have many characters since there are really 3 central ones in the series, but it wouldn't hurt to have more characters that have appeared in 1 or 2 games right? Also none of the LoZ characters really "stand out" I guess. They kind of feel like wasted opportunities. Toon Link could have drawn more from Wind Waker, Phantom Hourglass, and Spirit Tracks. Young Link is less of a deal, but something more to do with Majora's Mask would have been cool. Zelda is pretty boring imo, and don't even get me started on Ganondorf. It's a series with a big legacy behind it, but it feels so lacking even in comparsion to something smaller like the Kirby characters.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Cloud is pretty fun. He isn't as powerful as he was in Smash 4 but his limit mechanic is great if you want to add some variety to your gameplay. Chrom or Roy are good too if you like getting in your opponents face a lot. I would try Chrom first since he is more forgiving (in terms of hitting moves). Finally, Ike is a great choice too. Admittedly his playstyle is kind of linear but he can hit like a truck and has a few moves to learn how to mix up your recovery! Honestly you should give all of them a go, Lucina gets the job done but doesn't offer anything fun past that imo.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I would be lying if I said I didn't. Every game is flawed. Some games have a slow start or boring gameplay loops. Maybe the writing is bad or there are technical issues. These types of things can make me stop playing a game. However, I like to think back when I was younger when games were a lot harder to come by, and how I really appreciated the few games I had, learning everything about them. Obviously as an adult there are infinite choices on what to play, how to play, and where to play, but I think that makes us devalue certain pieces of media if they aren't living up to our standards 100% of the time. I'm not saying you should keep playing a game you utterly hate (thats just a waste of time) but maybe we should give more games a chance and see them through. My best gaming experiences that I can recall were focusing on one game in particular and getting hooked- or even just playing a hour a day. I guess what I am trying to say is that I would like to have a fully formed opinion on a game instead of a half baked one.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I am actually playing through MGS 1 right now, and while its a bit clunky to control, its still fun and honestly shocking how much they were able to pull off with the PS1. The best gameplay in the series is MGS 5, with practically limitless options to control how you want to play. However I think the best MGS game overall is MGS 3. It balances gameplay and story really well, and when they made it they finally reached a point where they could make the AI complex while also providing unique solutions to get out of even the smallest of conflicts. I highly recommend it.</TEXT>

I wouldn't be surprised if the creator of the games was making it up as he went along, but its fun to speculate. Personally I like to think of the first 3/4 games in a vacuum since its the most "cohesive" story. However the recent VR game they released actually had some major implications on the story of the games overall, so I guess we shall wait and see.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>It's not that the behavior can't be corrected, its that it breaks up the thing every relationship is based on. Respect and trust. Why risk being with someone who has a history of cheating and unfaithfulness if you could easily date someone who keeps it in their pants?</TEXT>

    <TITLE>Been playing Metal Gear Solid 1 recently, what an experience</TITLE>
    <DATE>2019-12-10 05:55:20</DATE>
    <TEXT>Let me preface and say I have no nostalgia for this game. I have only played 2 games in the series (MGS 3 and 5) before MGS 1. And from what I have played, I loved. The lore, the characters, how the tone of the games draw the line between serious and silly, the awesome stealth gameplay. MGS is honestly one of my favorite game series. So after getting a PS Classic for $20 and modding it, I decided to dive into MGS 1 with low expectations. So far it has exceeded them. The atmosphere in this game is terrific. I can't believe how much they were able to squeeze out of the PS1. Gripping music, dramatic cutscenes, tense stealth moments. This game even uses some FMV! The codec is so much fun to use, and all of Snake's teammates have something interesting to say at any moment. The voice acting is awesome. Snake sounds like a grizzled soldier instead of a chainsmoker in the later titles (I still like it there, its just more realistic here). The bosses were hit or miss for me. While I appreciate the memorable lines and catchphrases, some of the battles do tend to drag out a bit. The stealth gameplay is a bit simplified since this was the first MGS, but still fun. My biggest issue was the controls, which should come as no surprise. Considering the PS1 Classic does not come with the dual shock, the Dpad is required. The controls are frustrating but usable. Also a couple QoL improvements would be nice, like how the key card system. I might play the remake on the GameCube to see how they compare. Anyway, MGS 1 is still an amazing game that has stood the test of time as a fun and cinematic experience with an interesting (albeit convoluted plot), great themes and characters, and a peak into the experimental infancy of 3D games in the late 90's. I can't imagine how mindblowing this game must have been in 1998, no wonder its iconic.</TEXT>

I want to get a PS3 to I can have all the main games on one console.

    <TEXT>1. Shovel Knight 2. King Knight 3. Specter Knight 4. Plague Knight Honestly I think Shovel Knight feels a bit less special compared to the additions of the other games, but out of all of them it requires the smartest use of your abilities and items that makes for some tricky but fun platforming once you master it. I also love how every other game enhanced the story of Shovel Knight's while standing on their own merits. I can't wait to see what they do with the inevitable Shovel Knight sequel.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Yeah I get the most enjoyment out of a game by finishing it and evaluating my opinion about it in the end. Xenoblade Chronicles 2 was like that for me. I spent the first 20 hours not really enjoying it, then the story/combat clicked and I binged the rest of the game (which was another 40 hours) and had some of the most fun in a JRPG in years. Media is weird, the way to enjoy it doesn't just have one answer, but many as experiences impact your life and your tastes/habits change.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Tbh I'm not sure myself at times. Sometimes I stumble upon an interesting game reviewed by someone on YouTube, other times I will be watching something like E3 and keep a mental note of a game if I like the trailer or something. My best advice is to take a look at games you already like and see what similarities they have to games you may be vaguely interested in. At the same time, don't be afraid to go out of your comfort zone. I'm a complete wuss but I bought the RE2 remake and am having a blast.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I know people will say "that makes no sense, it would be too complicated, what would Nintendo have to gain from it" etc. But I would personally love it. It could have developer notes about all the different Smash games and some commentary. Also concept art and little things like that would make it an awesome collection. It's good to note the only time Nintendo has ported a Smash game was Smash 64 for the Wii, not the Wii U oddly ~~and Smash 4 to the Switch~~ so I wouldn't get my hopes too high. You also gotta consider how they might have to relicense everything since its a crossover with the 3rd parties in Brawl/Smash 4/ and Ultimate. Even if that wasn't an issue Nintendo tends to be weird with their rereleases/ports/remasters. They'll do things like put Xenoblade Chronicles on the New 3DS and remaster like every 3D Zelda game but won't do the same for Mario. They literally have official new GameCube controllers/adapters just for Smash, but no new news for a GameCube Virtual Console in the works or something like that. Anyway it would be a cool idea!</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Its gonna be interesting to see how games with unique gimmicks or hardware related quirks are going to be preserved, like MGS 4. I just find how fascinating how closely games are tied to the console they were released on, unlike a movie or song you cant just upload a file and play it back on any PC. You at the very least need the console it was released on and/or an emulator to play the ROM. That problem will only get worse as the years go by in my opinion. Even games built for PCs can have aging game engines they continually need to be modded again and again by the community to run on the latest hardware (Fallout for example). Then there comes the issue of old servers shutting down for crucial game updates, publishers that won't rerelease games (Nintendo and GameCube as an example), and shoddy ports. I recently got the FFVI port of Steam and it looks horrid. I guess the best we can do is it enjoy some of these games while they last, like what Mei Ling said in MGS 1, "You should be happy you've got enough free time to play a game. Enjoy yourself, okay?"</TEXT>

    <TEXT>You played the more action oriented RE games, which are pretty different from the older more survival horror themed RE games. Thankfully RE2 goes back to its roots and relies more on horror than action. Personally I love RE2 as the Police Station is just so much fun to explore. This game takes kind of like a Metroidvania approach and is really intriguing. I love all the puzzles and the way you have to conserve your ammo and supplies. In a way you almost have to play a strategy game as the game progresses, as more rooms open and the enemies become more hostile, with one in particular that will make you feel like you are playing a game of cat and mouse. Once you master the mechanics its really fun to replay as well. I highly recommend!</TEXT>

Plus the Smash team has proven time and time again they can make something from scraps of references that still feels fun to play, like ROB, Mr Game and Watch, Wii Fit, Villager, Pac-Man, and Piranha Plant.</TEXT>

We just happen to live in an age of information that has as many pros as well as cons.

    <TEXT>His moveset looks pretty basic ngl. Id rather they had focused on one weapon other than a sword instead of trying to cram all three into an avatar with practically no personality. Edelgard would have been 100x better. She fits so many criterias for a good FE rep. I know people will say, "that would be biased against the other two houses!" and I strongly disagree. Edelgard plays a major role in literally all the routes of Three Houses and would have been the closest thing we got to a FE villian. I mean we got to accept it at this point, however that doesn't mean I'm not still disappointed.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>If Corrin had Snake's moveset I don't think I would play Corrin much because I don't like him as a character. To me Smash has always been about the characters. For example, while Ganondorf is probably the worst represented character in the whole game, I still love playing his weird moveset because its Ganondorf. I love playing Pac-Man because I love his personality and references that influence his moveset. I can't comprehend how to play Shulk well, but Xenoblade Chronicles is one of my favorite games of all time. Little Mac is so bad in the game, but I love his aesthetic and design. While a great moveset really helps a character, I think the most important thing about Smash- and something future Smash games may never live up to, is the amount of care and detail is put into making sure each character captures the heart of someone, moveset or not. If you need any proof, people were cheering the Sans Mii Fighter costume as if he actually got into the game, and recently the Cuphead costume caused a similar reaction. I don't even play Mii Gunner and I was so happy.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>The Mother games are a series of RPGs made by Nintendo that have released on the NES, SNES, and GBA. They are characterized by their surreal settings and ideas, and are really self aware and funny. Only the first two were released outside Japan and are titled Earthbound Beginnings and Earthbound. You can play Earthbound Beginnings on Wii U, and Earthbound on the Wii U, New 3DS, and SNES Classic Console. Mother 3 was never released outside of Japan but has a very faithful fan translation that can be played on an emulator. Out of the 3 I highly recommend Mother 3, Earthbound is great too, but the game isn't my cup of tea. I hope this helped!</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I like how the gameplay really ties into the animations. Due to the fact you die so many times on each level, it gives you time to appreciate all the work put into them. With a run and gun game like Cuphead, the animations are an essential part to convey information to the player. The wind up of an attack, the action, and the followthrough all feel so satisfying to look at. Great game design animation is hard to do, and the way they did it always astounds me.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I have a love/hate relationship with Earthbound. To me everything felt kind of disconnected, like a bunch of stuff happened then the game ended. I didn't like how boring the battle system was, or the fact its more difficult in the beginning in the end. I didn't like the fact all the characters that join your party seem to become mute once they do. However, when it does something right, it does it well. I love Magicant and exploring Ness's mind, I love the homesick status effect, I love how endearing and disturbing the music can get. It's a game of extremes for me. I can respect it, even if its not what I expected.</TEXT>

He plays like how I would expect the real Solid Snake would move. Watching a great Pac-Man is magical, like seeing dominos cascading. Tea is a great player! Honestly I love watching the Belmonts too, I just love how some people can space the whip SO WELL and rely on it more than just projectiles (which will only carry you so far).</TEXT>

It was always so loud and cramped that I brought along my 3DS to make the wait shorter. Since it was too early to do anything really meaningful in the game, I would always get a coffee to go and sit on the bench overlooking the ocean as the sun slowly crept along the horizon. I'm so hyped for New Horizons!</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I predict Byleth will just get easier to play against overtime and will slowly drop down the tier list. Mediocre to bad frame data, low mobility, and lack of good "get out of jail" options are pretty bad in this game. That said a good Byleth can create space pretty effectively, but all their negatives are pretty apparent. Also for Ganondorf, he becomes significantly easier to play against when you realize most of his tactics are supposed to invoke fear in you. Just remember to keep him at medium range in neutral, then when he gets in disadvantage exploit every weakness he has.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I'm not joking when I say this game is a bit of an existential crisis. It's a life simulator without all the real pressures of life. Like life, it is what you make of it. No overarching story, no endgame, nothing. That's what makes me love this game, you will get as much out of it as you put in. It focuses on the magic of simple pleasures, like getting a new piece of furniture or finding a rare fish. I remember all the way back in high school I would have to ride the bus in the mornings. The ride was so long and loud. Every so often I would pull out my 3DS and boot up Animal Crossing. Since it was really early, all the shops in my town were closed- except the coffee shop. I remember I would always order one cup of coffee and have my character sit down on a bench overlooking the ocean as the sun rose over the horizon. They would sit there, slowly enjoying their coffee. That was one of the few things that kept me sane on those bus rides. Would that mean something to someone else? Probably not, but it meant so much to me. I chose to build that coffee shop, I perfectly positioned that bench near the ocean, and I planted the flowers that decorated my custom pathway. Those things take a lot of time in game, but they were all worth it. I also have to say Animal Crossing is probably one of the most unintentionally sad games. One day you'll get bored or busy and leave your town for it to literally rot away. Villagers will move out, weeds will grow everywhere, and cockroaches will infest your home. Its like visiting your childhood home to see it in ruin. I completely understand if its not your cup of tea, but I don't think I have played any other game series like it.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I think where you play also influences how you'll enjoy the gane too. While I like my PC, sitting alone in a dark room having to configure the controls and waiting for all the updates to install can really take you out of the experience of a game. While I'm fine doing this for AAA releases (since you want all the bells and whistles) for indie games I get anxious. The Switch is like the perfect console for those kinds of moments.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I like doing it to experience the game when it was originally released, to satisfy my curiosity and see if I'm up to the challenge. I always feel really bad save scumming my way through a level because I like being challenged. However if its something like speeding up a tedious game thats all good.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I always thought Doom 1  amp; 2 were super tongue in cheek though, with things like the text after each chapter, John Romero's head, the heavy metal influence (to the point of plagiarism basically) on the OST, Doomguy's face, the focus on gameplay over story, Daisy dying, etc. I think they were just trying to make a fun shooter in the vein of Wolfenstein while using the setting of hell to give it that extra "oomph" they needed.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>So I'm noticing you like to use Up Smash a lot on the ledge. While it is a pretty good option, keep in mind Snake has a lot of other great ledge options too, such as C4, grenade, and down smash. Mixing them up will keep your opponents on their toes, same with your landing options. In neutral Snake also has a lot of tools to get in. Dash Attack, F Tilt, and D tilt are moves you should use more, and grabs when you can get them. Also Shorthop Dair OOS is a great "get off me" tool. With the grenades there are a TON of ways to mix them up. Sometimes I'll camp and Smash Throw them from the other side of the stage, other times I'll Z drop or throw them down to stall their timer(s). But yeah, overall just keep working on exploring all the different options Snake has! (Also the misinputs) I love maining him, its like he is 5 different characters in one.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Yeah people get set in their ways and seem to think that their personal tastes are the basis of what games should be. They aren't. Like any medium, video games are continually evolving overtime. Certain trends will come and go. For me, I personally didn't enjoy Super Mario Odyssey because it wasn't the intended experience I grew up with, such as Super Mario Galaxy. But after seeing a lot of people who prefer and enjoy games like Odyssey, it made me realize Odyssey isn't a bad Mario game, but it's a game that isn't meant for me. On the flipside, I absolutely adored BotW over every other 3D Zelda game because it represented the parts I love the most in the franchise.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>To be honest, collectibles in any game destroy the pacing for me. Sometimes I just want a good challenge in the main part of the game and not have to worry about the anxiety of finding the 200 macguffins y'know? This is most egregious in platformers. I swear DKC Returns/Tropical Freeze and Rayman Origins/Legends have superb level design, but then they gotta chock like 50 different collectibles in each stage. I know I can just avoid them, but in something like Rayman you need Lums in order to access certain stages. Going back to Doom 2016, I made sure to avoid collecting anything I didn't find naturally. Sure I missed out on a bunch of cool stuff, but I was able to play the game at my own pace and focus on the gameplay. I'm doing the same with Eternal right now, gotta say the collectibles in this game are a lot more fun though.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>This game makes me so happy! It brings me back to a simpler time before DLC, expansions, and patches. I'm not even talking about shady business practices either. I'm talking about the very heavy focus on gameplay mechanics. The emphasis on platforming. The unintrusive but engaging story. The ***fun*** optional content (this is a big one for me). The game feels like the people who made it have actually played video games before and just wanted to prioritize the player's happiness over anything else. Don't get me wrong, indie games do this kind of stuff all the time. But in terms of AAA titles, we don't see it that often. Sure Nintendo has been making some hits the past few years but they would never make a game like this. The only thing that makes me sad about this game is that it may be awhile before we see anything like it again.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Some of your points I feel are positives of Eternal. I absolutely loved the platforming and arcadey feel for example. I mean, we all know its not a perfect game. No game is. Plus it just came out. People are bound to be excited still. I understand where you are coming from, when Mario Odyssey came out people were heralding it as one of the greatest games of all time when I thought it was only good. I kept saying it had objective flaws too, but I also had a lot of subjective bias. Honestly the internet is just a bad place in general to look for varied opinions. Its like you have to either 100% love something or 100% dislike something to not be drowned out.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I've actually been trying to play the whole Doom series and here is my ranking so far of the ones I've played. 1. Doom Eternal 2. Doom 3. Doom 2016 4. Doom II I've played a little bit of Doom 3 and Doom 64 so far but not enough to have a full opinion on them (however they are pretty great so far). Doom II's biggest problem is that it feels too disjointed and obtuse. Sprinkled in the game you'll have levels that feel like they were made as a joke. Another problem I had is the music. Its so lacking compared to the amazing metal music of the first game.There is little consistency, which is a shame because I love everything else about the game. The enemy designs are fun, the secrets are great, the SSG is amazing. But the more I play the game, the more I find myself comparing it to Doom 1.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>In my opinion it was amazing, I thought the lamer parts of the plot were just there as an excuse to go to a lot more varied locations than Doom 2016. I always felt the game was throwing something new and fun at me. I vastly prefer the gameplay of Eternal in comparison to Doom 2016 (which got kind of repetitive towards the end). While the wealth of new weapons and upgrades did kind of bloat the game a bit, they were all fun to use and had a purpose besides looking cool. While I miss some aspects of Doom 2016, such as the environmental storytelling and subtleness (to the extent of a Doom game). Eternal felt like it took the best parts of that game and went all out, which is exactly what I wanted.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>u/Doggedshrimp had a great idea to let users flair their posts "Advice" or "Limbo"  gt;This subreddit should be a guidance subreddit where people can post their memes and we guide them to the correct comedy subreddit. This subreddit should also be used for when a meme can be posted to multiple comedy subreddits. We can separate the two categories with two flairs; advice and limbo. I believe this is a sub the comedy community is lacking and it has the perfect name for this use. I will update the rules to coincide with this change. Any feedback would be appreciated! Does anyone specifically have a list of the most active comedy subreddits? I never expected this sub to have 3k+ subscribers lol</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Yeah a lot of people give up right before the first major roadblock when learning a new skill it seems. Gaming has the benefit of being comfy. Convenient. Forgiving. A lot of things in real life aren't. People think that if something doesn't instantly satisfy the reward centers of the brain, its not worth their time. We have other emotions too. We can feel sadness, anger, passion. Its about embracing those emotions and finding new ways to interact with the world. One example is building a garden. It can be physically demanding, extremely uncomfortable, and may not be worth the effort. But when you get to see your progress- all the time and labor, even to grow a single tomato, you appreciate and respect it.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I am really grateful for my PC. I originally got it as a prebuilt and slowly switched out things in it over time. Either through purchasing parts, trading, or getting them as gifts. You don't know frustration until you have to play a modern game on 4gb of RAM. Right now I am content with my PC. Sure its on the low end and can't run triple A games at high settings, but there comes a point where you just don't care anymore.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Sometimes when I to listen to a song, right before the climax happens I start running. I like to think I'm in a movie and this will be the part where I have an epiphany- or a chance of redemption. Music can stir up so many emotions... Some good, some bad. But when you run it seems to amplify everything that is in your soul. And just for a moment you can feel as if you can get away from it all.</TEXT>

I wouldn't say games should just be played for gameplay over story, but the gameplay is the glue that holds the entire foundation of the game together. Admittedly I don't think the combat in XC1 is that fun most of the game with how tedious it can get. However the other aspects such as the massive world, orchestral score, and lovable characters really immerse me in the world of the game. The way I see it, as long as a game is continually engaging me its doing something right.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Personally I think both games are pretty great. However I enjoy 1 a lot more due to its consistency in worldbuilding and the tone of the story. The sheer scale of the Bionis and Mechonis doesn't need to be conveyed through words, its shown through the vast and varied landscapes each Titan possesses. You can literally see different parts of the titans' bodies as you progress, making you feel small but empowered. On the other hand, while XC2 raises the stakes and adds more titans to make the scale of Alrest seem bigger, functionally it makes the different kingdoms feel like worlds in a Mario game. Also, while the only character I really liked in XC2 was Zeke, I love half the cast of XC1. Shulk in particular is a great main character. He is just curious about the world around him and wants to know more, even when he is on his revenge driven quest. Plus his friendship with Reyn is so well written. They really trust each other and call each other out if one of them is acting weird.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>-10 hours -2000 hours -2016 -2015 I'm not gonna say Melee is the savior of mankind or anything, but I like it. I can already tell there is a lot of depth to this game and I really love certain aspects of it, such as the tech roll situations. That being said I like Ultimate a bit more since its easier to pick up and play with far less of an execution barrier, along with having more visual variety and characters. Its a shame Project M/Plus has a smaller scene because I would love to see more of that game played competitively.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I find it really hard to separate art from the artist when the artist puts a lot of themselves into their art. Its more tolerable in something like a movie which 100s of people work on, but in something like a YouTube video its impossible. After JonTron had his whole drama a few years ago I went back to some of his earlier videos like Takeshi's challenge where he made a joke about not being racist. I felt so uncomfortable. Plus supporting their art means you are supporting them financially- so yeah its in the best interest to forget about them and move on.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>While a lot of people dislike his playstyle, I think he fits a pretty good niche on the roster. Sure his zero to death or grab combos are devastating, but Luigi has to put in some work to get in if the other player is good. His recovery is also pretty predictable.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>This game just has so much depth... Literally miles ahead of Mario Kart in that regard. There are just so many things that make CTR greater, like the god tier roster, the plethora of single player modes, the time trials that force you to make the most out of the games mechanics... I could go on and on. That said I do believe the multiplayer in Mario Kart is way more fun since anyone can jump into it and you aren't reliant on Fire/Blue Fire to succeed. Plus the items are more balanced. Overall though I love CTR and hope more people give it a shot.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>The Metal Gear Solid games are as anime as you can get. Its only realistic in aesthetic, but surreal in everything else. One moment Snake will be talking about the spread of information and the proliferation of PMC's, and the next moment there will be something silly like wearing a chicken hat or Big Boss believing in Santa Claus. Its one of the best video game series ever made imo.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Tbh Snake is just intimidating because he has so many options he can do at any given moment. You got Up Smash, Grenades, Nikita, C4, etc. That's not even getting into the wealth of his down throw follow ups. I think the key to learning him is just understanding the utility of each of his tools and maximizing their use. I suggest doing that if you ever want to learn him. Experiment with each of tools separately as you would in a MGS game. Every game just take your time on one aspect of his kit. Take the C4 for example. While its very good for stage control and positioning, it can also be used to recover! When you develop an understanding of the applications of his kit, you can start trying to mix different moves together  #128077;</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Exactly, thats why something like Icons failed. It didn't offer much that you could already get from Smash. Rivals of Aether on the other hand offers characters that can interact with the environment in unique ways, different yet refined mechanics, and the Steam workshop. The only exception I can think of is Slap City, but that game is still really fun in its own way.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I was talking more in the general sense. The difference between Smash and Street Fighter is that half the marketing for Smash is already done right out the gate since it features iconic Nintendo characters. Something like Rivals of Aether might have the greatest movement or mechanics ever available in a fighting game, but to a casual player (which makes up the vast majority of the playerbase) its inferior because it doesn't have Link or Donkey Kong. This makes the demographic for these types of games smaller than they already are. Rivals of Aether recently added a Steam Workshop to alleviate part of this, while something like Icons floundered because it brought nothing to draw a general audience in.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Exactly! Its like when Marvel vs. Capcom Infinite released and one of the developers/producers said the characters don't matter that much since they are essentially "functions" in the game. Considering how the reception of that game turned out I think its fair to say character recognizabiility and personal attachment plays a major factor into how much time someone wants to invest in a game.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Yeah as you get older its easy to min-max game mechanics especially when you've seen them in other games. Take Animal Crossing for example. While its ok to play the game how you like, I think time traveling/turnip grinding kind of ruins the experience of playing it. I've seen a lot of people already get exhausted with the game when it's best enjoyed at a slow burn.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>No one else really made platformers in the style of Crash, which is a shame because I love it's gameplay style. I see people recommending collectathons here but for me those don't fill the itch of a tightly designed platformer. Have you played the Mario Galaxy games? They aren't similar to Crash but have some of my favorite 3D platforming in any game I've ever played. Also they are very easy to get into.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I'm talking more about from an art history perspective, which I probably should have made more clear. Some art was made for a functional purpose, yet we admire it for its form today. Like a Sarcophagus. I think ignoring the context and history behind a piece is really detrimental to judging it, as no art exists in a vacuum. If you take an art piece like the "Fountain" which is literally just a urinal sculpture by itself, its pretty stupid. But when you consider the history behind the piece and how it influenced other artists to use readymade sculptures (even today) you can see it's impact. But this just me talking about past art, I think contemporary art is another story. /rj why did they put politics in my art, stupid sjws</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I feel Doom Eternal is pretty exhausting to play, but for the right reasons. While I can't play Doom 2016 for long periods of time due to how repetitive it its, Eternal is a much better game due to how every weapon has a certain niche/purpise now. Along with its aggressive stance on resource management and all the different environments/enemy types, I'd say it blows Doom 2016 out of the water.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Welcome! You'll be fine. The community for Ultimate is still VERY strong and isn't dying soon. Infact we are still getting a ton of DLC for the future. In my opinion I don't think there will be a new Smash game for awhile so I would just go for it. Though I would also get some other games if you are thinking of buying a Switch, like BotW or Mario Odyssey. This game has so much content its absurd. Its the type of game you play for years.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>In Rivals, there are no ledge grabs at all. Instead characters have more freedom out of a walljump, like using Up B into Walljump into another Up B. That's cool and all, I just prefer Smash's approach because I love ledge trapping and I play a lot of defensive characters.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I've been theorizing this a bunch with some people on Discord. There are a few possibilities. -The leaks are real. The costumes themselves are very high quality, with good proportions and art design. Very similar to costumes Nintendo could actually release. Also at this time modding Mii Costumes in this fashion wasn't feasible (at least to the public) -The leaks are fake. Some guy got three wishes from a genie and decided to use all of them to make high quality Smash Bros. leaks. This is plausible due to the precedent set by The Grinch leak. However faking gameplay *footage* is a 1000x harder. -Its a mix of both. Maybe these were Mii Fighter concepts for potential fighter pass characters? Maybe those deals fell through? Maybe Nintendo has a nuclear stockpile of Mii Costumes in case the apocolypse happens and their main dev team can't work on actual fighters? In my opinion, I'm leaning to these costumes being real due to how high quality the art assets are. I would have expected some random guy to pull an Artsy Omni to get more followers, but its been almost a year with nothing new back. However that being said, people are devious. The Grinch leaker never came out either and is probably laughing to themself like an idiot reading these kinds of threads.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I'd love more Western reps. The one remaining genre that *needs* to be represented in Smash is the first person shooter. Whether that be Doomguy, Master Chief, Gordon, etc. I think Smash is missing a major part of gaming history by not having a FPS rep.</TEXT>
