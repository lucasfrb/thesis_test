    <TEXT>I don #8217;t know, all I ever do is take breaks, I #8217;m behind on school, I never talk to anyone irl, I never wanna get out of bed, I just don #8217;t see the point in taking a break, I don #8217;t think it would get better if I did, it #8217;d just keep getting worse like always, and I #8217;m the worst cuz I #8217;m too impulsive, good for nothing, and all I ever do is hurt the people who care about me, I wish no one would care about me</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I #8217;m dwelling on many specific events, when I say hurting people, I mean I #8217;m hurting them emotionally because of my horrible mental state, and doing things like self harm and shit, and I guess I could try doing some nice things for them, but I feel like doing mean things to them, maybe they wouldn #8217;t care about me anymore if I did, idk I #8217;ll try it, thanks</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Sounds like depression, but I #8217;m not a professional, so not 100% sure, also, yeah I totally feel ya, being addicted to feeling bad, I always get mad mad at myself whenever I #8217;m feeling even a little happy, and I tend to do pretty much anything I can to make myself feel horrible again, I remember one morning a while ago, I didn #8217;t feel quite as depressed as normal when I woke up, and I did everything in my power to make myself feel bad again, but nothing was working, I started panicking, eventually I got myself to feel horrible again, I don #8217;t know why I want to feel horrible, I just do</TEXT>

    <TEXT>The thing is, I don #8217;t really want everything to be perfect, I #8217;m addicted to feeling horrible, and I don #8217;t want to feel better, I don #8217;t want anyone to care about me, because then I #8217;m making my problems their problems, when I #8217;m the only one that should have to deal with them</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Yeah, honestly I have no clue who I am, every time I think I do, I always realize later that that isn #8217;t who I am at all, I keep having these weird half-blackouts, and after they happen it feels like I #8217;m a different person, just with the same memories and stuff, I should probably talk to my psychiatrist about that</TEXT>

    <TEXT>There #8217;s something going on with my head but I have no idea what, well actually I have a few ideas of what I may be, but I really don #8217;t know, I was recently diagnosed with depression, but there #8217;s something else going on with me, I go through periods of being absolutely sure that it #8217;s one thing, and then realising that that was not at all what it was, then again, I guess it could be one of the things that I #8217;ve thought I proved wrong, I had a couple periods of this with thinking I had depression, then thinking it definitely wasn #8217;t, but then I was diagnosed with it, so I don #8217;t know, I #8217;m just way too confused right now</TEXT>
