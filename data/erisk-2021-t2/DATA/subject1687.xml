    <TEXT>Before you downvote me into oblivion, let me explain why I think this way:  #8203; 1. I find Mineta more visually appealing to me than any of the other characters. Characters like todoroki and all might look cool, but not as cool as this purple midget. 2. His quirk is actually pretty cool compared to some of the other quirks like hagakure's or ojiro's. I think a lot of you would agree with me if he didn't use it like a pervert. 3. His voice is for some reason really soothing. I don't know why... 4. As I said before, he is a pervert, but if you think about it he's not that bad. I bet half of the men reading this would want to stare at a naked female.  #8203; That's pretty much it. I think if he wasn't such a pervert that at least some of you would agree with me.</TEXT>

Who knows the damage it would cause in a fight? https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=WbKUJTbSXrw In this clip, you can see some of the gang in action. Mac and Charlie would be such a formidable force that the z fighters would struggle with. https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=7zwFg_QuW3c Here you can see some of dee's fighting and more of Charlie's. Just the fact that they scared the guy away just by looking at him means that they are pretty tough. https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=3uDTYdFGhjs In this fight you see some of Dennis's feats. Do you see how casually he survived the mac and cheese falling on him? And at the end when he has the fire poker, it looked like he was about to terrorize the town.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=WbKUJTbSXrw Mac and Charlie and Frank could possibly at least battle with krillen, seeing as he's the weakest z fighter. Now Mac, charlie, and Frank would most likely not win that battle, but they at least damage krillen in some sort of way. Dee could probably blind some of them (because she looks like a bird) before she gets speed blitzed. Dennis could possibly distract goku with all the Mac and cheese and while he's eating hit him with the fire poker, but I doubt this will do anything</TEXT>

    <TEXT>For the clip I provided where Mac and Charlie beat up the children, and the one were Frank beats the shit out of dennis, it obviously means that these 3 characters are the strongest ones in the gang. Last I checked, Krillen was the strongest human, and usually in media humans are pretty weak. He may be strong, but a swift kick in the groin would be enough to kill anyone. Also, in [this clip](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bc0hWZr-tzA), Krillen is easily stabbed by Frieza's horn. Why couldn't Frank just use his toe knife with the same result?</TEXT>

Mac should be able to hold him off for a while. Frank does have a couple condoms lying around, which he could put over Krillen's head while he's busy with Mac or Charlie.

    <TITLE>Captain underpants is as strong, if not stronger than superman</TITLE>
    <DATE>2019-05-11 03:21:32</DATE>
    <TEXT>This is shown in the graphic novel "Super diaper baby: invasion of the potty snatchers" when super diaper baby and diaper dog move earth to freeze rip van tinkle. "But this is one of super diaper baby's feats, not captain underpants's!" You say. Well, in the original super diaper baby book, deputy dangerous gives captain underpants's powers to super diaper baby and diaper dog, meaning that they are absolutely equal strength wise. This means captain underpants can move planets and fly to Uranus in 15 seconds! That's not all. Captain underpants was able to beat two robots who were capable of kicking a football to Uranus. Not only that, he was able to beat them when they were much larger than before, obviously making them stronger. Finally in terms of feats, CU was able to beat tippy tinkle trousers, a mad scientist who freaking caused the BIG BANG. To add on to this, captain underpants was only beaten 3 times. Twice by the turbo toilet 2000 and the other time by sir stinks a lot. This means that both the turbo toilet 2000 and sir stinks a lot are way stronger than superman. Sorry for any bad formatting and/or spelling and grammar, because I am on mobile.</TEXT>

    <TITLE>I genuinely think that if Springfield and Quahog went to war, Springfield would win</TITLE>
    <DATE>2019-05-11 07:11:20</DATE>
    <TEXT>I've asked several times on www if Springfield and Quahog went to war, who would win. The general answer was Quahog, because it has generally more violent people like Peter and Joe. I personally think that being violent will not help you much in a battle. It pretty much means that the more violent team would try to kill you in a more gruesome way. Springfield though, has a bigger population than Quahog. Peter would probably only be able to handle one person. If you add 4 more to that, Peter's going down. Also, Springfield has smarter people. Professor Frink is definitely smarter than stewie, and rainier wolfcastle could easily take the Griffin family combined. Herman could supply Springfield with weaponry, and Mr. Burns could dump nuclear waste into Quahog's water, mutating anyone who drinks it. Also, Springfield has been shown to work together to defeat a much larger threat before, like the time the dolphins invaded, or the time the u.s government trapped them under a dome. Quahog honestly doesn't stand a chance against Springfield.</TEXT>

    <TITLE>The muppets are NOT weak, thank you very much</TITLE>
    <DATE>2019-05-22 01:49:38</DATE>
    <TEXT>Recently on r/whowouldwin I discovered a thread about the entire cast of the muppets vs Darth Vader. Everyone started saying that this was a mismatch, and that the muppets couldn't even lay a finger on Darth Vader. The thing is though, they could. First off, they have the numbers. There are over 2,000 muppets at the moment, and a lot of them are crazy good with weapons, or they have brute strength. They could easily take down foes like captain America or Harry potter. The muppets also have a large supply of weapons and technology. Crazy Harry sets off bombs whenever he hears the word "explode" and the Swedish chef has a gun somewhere in his kitchen. They also have a seemingly endless supply of boomerang fish, which would probably be able to knock out enemies from afar. There's also Animal and Miss Piggy, who both have incredible strength feats. Dr. Bunsen Honeydew and Beaker have technology capable of destroying entire towns. We also have cookie monster, who was a fucking spy at one point. Over all, the muppets would have a great damage output. They also have great durability feats, like surviving several explosions and being eaten. In conclusion, all of the muppets combined are at least city busting level. I would love to hear your thoughts in the comments, and sorry for any bad formatting and spelling mistakes because I'm on mobile.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>While fortnite is a good game, I don't believe it has deserved the title of "best game in the world". So many games have come out that are superior to fortnite, for example: red dead redemption 2, Spiderman, smash ultimate, kingdom hearts, etc. This is why I usually go to other games like minecraft or overwatch.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>So recently me and a load of my other friends stopped hanging out with my ex-friend Jackson because he was being a giant asshole. We basically ignored him for about a month until a few days ago he messaged me saying that he has depression so he has the right to be a giant dick to all of us. He then says that abusing us is his coping mechanism. My question for you all is: Is being an ass really a coping mechanism for depression or is he just making excuses?</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Here's a bit of backstory: Today my dad said that I had to clean the bathrooms to get ready for thanksgiving. I often do this as a chore, but for the past 3 weeks my parent's have stopped paying me entirely. So today I decided that if I'm not getting paid, I'm not cleaning up their mess. When I mention this to my cousin, he usually says that they're my parents, therefor I should always help out them. To be honest, my dad is a nut job. Once I graduate high school, I'm getting the frick out of here. Anyway, my parents go off to the store, leaving me home alone. I decide to clean my room, since I had nothing else to do. Once I finish, I take a nap and by the time I wake up my parents are home. I go down stairs and say hello, then go back up stairs to play my xbox. Fast forward to 3 minutes ago, my parents confront me, saying that I'm addicted to electronics so badly that I can't get my chores done. He says that by the end of the day he wants me to give him all of my electronics. I'm writing this on reddit while I still can. Do you have any ideas?</TEXT>

    <TEXT>So this happened a several years ago when I was in 6th grade, but I didn't hear about it until recently. Basically, my teacher would purposely lose assignments just so that she could fail kids she didn't like. Most of the kids she failed were boys, because she was a feminist.</TEXT>

    <DATE>2020-06-01 16:12:16</DATE>
    <TEXT>You are completely right. For years now this site has been nothing but radical political circlejerking from out-of-touch sheltered privileged children. And the best way these "woke" hordes of horny Reddit armchair warriors achieve their mighty circlejerking climax is to shower pearly strands of unmitigated and deranged hatred towards average Americans who just want to make a living and provide for their families. Reddit loves to pretend how "*of the people*" they are, but meanwhile they shit all over normal people in the most revoltingly classist and holier-than-thou way at every opportunity they have with the rankest and most steaming piles of misinformation and falsehoods you can imagine. It's like the bigger and more disgusting the lie, the more hate-filled, condescending and anti-American it is, the more they edge themselves towards that creamy climax. But hey, any cheap lie is okay if you get to feel morally superior to people you don't like and dehumanize them for not agreeing with you... right guys, right!?!?!! Reddit is BY FAR the most insufferable clan of self-righteous intellectually dishonest false moralizers that I could ever imagine. Watching grandma post memes on Facebook is better than the bullshit self-congratulatory political grandstanding content Reddit churns out. Pages and pages of "look at me repeating the approved political message" gets old REAL fast. Its like legions of children screaming "*PLEASE, tell me what I am supposed to think in order to be popular and trendy*". This is the current state of Reddit. One minute Reddit is talking about how they can't wait for old people to die so they can "hAvE tHeiR rEvOLuTiOn!!!!", then, we are supposed to all of a sudden think they actually care about old people dying. Reddit one minute says "*STAY INSIDE, peaceful protestors opposing the lockdowns are eViL!!!!*", then all of a sudden change their minds and say "*These other protestors burning down cities are just FINE!*" Spare me! So sick of it! Reddit will use anything to push its divisive opportunistic politics... even a pandemic, even tragic killing. But it all isn't as surprising when looking back at the words of Rahm Emanuel: "*You never let a serious crisis go to waste.*" If there is anything that needs to be burned to the ground, it is this fucking website. Reddit just needs to draw in a DEEP breathe by taking a big step back and literally removing their cocks from their own mouths.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>You useless piece of shit. You absolute waste of space and air. You uneducated, ignorant, idiotic dumb swine, you #8217;re an absolute embarrassment to humanity and all life as a whole. The magnitude of your failure just now is so indescribably massive that one hundred years into the future your name will be used as moniker of evil for heretics. Even if all of humanity put together their collective intelligence there is no conceivable way they could have thought up a way to fuck up on the unimaginable scale you just did. When Jesus died for our sins, he must not have seen the sacrilegious act we just witnessed you performing, because if he did he would have forsaken humanity long ago so that your birth may have never become reality. After you die, your skeleton will be displayed in a museum after being scientifically researched so that all future generations may learn not to generate your bone structure, because every tiny detail anyone may have in common with you degrades them to a useless piece of trash and a burden to society. No wonder your father questioned whether or not your were truly his son, for you'd have to not be a waste of carbon matter for anyone to love you like a family member. Your birth made it so that mankind is worse of in every way you can possibly imagine, and you have made it so that society can never really recover into a state of organization. Everything has forever fallen into a bewildering chaos, through which unrecognizable core, you can only find misfortune. I would say the apocalypse is upon us but this is merely the closest word humans have for the sheer scale of horror that is now reality. You have forever condemned everyone you love and know into an eternal state of suffering, worse than any human concept of hell. You are such an unholy being, that if you step within a one hundred foot radius of a holy place or a place that has ever been deemed important by anyone, your distorted sac religious soul will ruin whatever meaning it ever had beyond repair. You are an idiotic, shiteating, dumbass ape and no one has ever loved you. Rhodes Island would have been better off if you'd never joined us. You are a lying, backstabbing, cowardly useless piece of shit and I hate you with every single part of my being. Even this worlds finest writers and poets from throughout the ages could never hope to accurately describe the scale on which you just fucked up, and how incredibly idiotic you are. Anyone that believes in any religion out there should now realize that they have been wrong this entire time, for if divine beings were real, they would never have allowed a being such as you to stain the earth and this universe. In the future there will be horror stories made about you, with the scariest part of them being that the reader has to realize that such an indescribable monster actually exists, and that the horrific events from the movie have actually taken place in the same world that they live in right now. You are the absolute embodiment of everything that has ever been wrong on this earth, yet you manage to make it so that that is only a small part of the evil that is your being. Never in the history of mankind has there been anyone that could have predicted such an eldrich abomination, but here you are. It #8217;s hard to believe that I am seeing such an incredible failure with my own eyes, but here I am, so unfortunately I cannot deny your existence. Even if I did my very best, my vocabulary is not able to describe the sheer magnitude of the idiotic mistake that is you. Even if time travel some day will be invented, there still would not be a single soul willing to go back in time to before this moment to fix history, because having to witness such incredible horrors if they failed would have to many mental and physical drawbacks that not even the bravest soul in history would be willing to risk it. I cannot imagine the pure dread your mother must have felt when she had to carry a baby for nine months and then giving birth to such a wretched monster as you. Not a single word of the incoherent, illogical rambling you may be wanting to do to defend yourself or apologize would ever be able to make up for what you just did. The countries of the world would have wanted to make laws preventing such a terrible event like this from ever happening again, but sadly this is not possible since your horrific actions just now have shattered every form of order this world once had, making concepts such as laws irrelevant. Right from the moment I first set my eyes on you I knew you were an absolute abomination of everything that is wrong with humanity. I was hoping I would have been able to prevent your evil from being released upon this world by tagging along and keeping my eye on you, but it is clear to me now that not even the greatest efforts would have been able to prevent a terrible event in this scale from occurring. You are the worst human being, or even just being in general, that I have ever had the misfortune of witnessing. Events like the infected plague apparently only happened with the goal of teaching humanity to survive such a horrible event as the one you just created, but not even mankind #8217;s greatest trials were able to even slightly prepare anyone for the insufferable evil you have just created. If you ever had them, your children would be preemptively killed to protect this universe from the possibility of anyone in your bloodline being even half as bad as you are, except you will never be able to have children, because not a single human being will ever want to come within a hundred mile radius of you and anything you have ever touched. You are a colossal disappointment not only to your parents, but to your ancestors and entire bloodline. The disgusting mistake that you have just made is so incredibly terrible that everyone who would ever be to hear about it would spontaneously feel an indescribable mixture of immense anger, fear and anxiety that emotionally and physically they would never truly be the same ever again. The sheer scale of your mistake, if ever to be materialized, would not only surpass the size of the world, but it would reach far beyond the edges of the known, and almost certainly the unknown universe. I could sit here and write paragraphs, nay, books describing your immense failure, yet even if I were to dedicate my life to describing the reality of what has just gone down here, and I would spend every moment of it until my heart stops beating working as hard and efficiently as possible, yet there is not even a snowballs chance in hell that I would be able to come close to transcribing the absolute shitshow you have just released upon the world. You are an irresponsible, idiotic, disgusting, unloved, horrible excuse for a living being who #8217;s soul contains less humanity than every ginger in history combined. The absolute disgust I feel when thinking about anything that has even a slight resemblance to anything that might have to do with you and your unholy actions is so incredibly great that when I am honest about it I think that even I do not posses a consciousness great enough to comprehend my own feelings about it. When people of Columbia fought to break free from Lungmen, countless soldiers fought and lost their lives in favor of a chance at a better future for their children, they did not give their lives to have you fuck the world up beyond repair to the degree that you are doing right now. Honestly, even when technology advances and studies on the subject become more and more accurate, I do not think humanity will ever truly be able to understand what your failure actually means for the universe. My hate for you and everything you stand for is so much deeper than the depths of Shambala that you could probably take the entire Lungmen population down there and back up around twenty million times before you would have sunk to the end of my hate, and honestly, I do not want to exaggerate, but I think that that insult was low balling it such a massive amount that all mountains in this world combined would not be able to stack up to this imprecise judgement in light of the fact that when being honest, my hate is almost certainly bottomless. There is no one in this world that has ever loved you, and especially after what you just did, no one will ever love you in the future either. There is no hope that your idiotic behavior and especially your crooked soul will ever change for the better, and in fact quite the opposite might be true. By making the mistake that you just did, you have shown me that you are so incredibly hopeless that you will only devolve into a more idiotic and wretched creature than you already are. The only possible way in which your future would be brighter than the black hole your existence currently is would exclusively be because there is absolutely no conceivable way that you would even be able to sink lower than the pathetic place your current failure has put you in.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>So all the way back in 2013 my parents divorced, and I ended up living with my mom and little brother. A few months ago my dad started trying to contact my mom. My mom ignored him, and that really pissed off my dad. He went to the bar one night and got drunk. 3 hours later he's in new york and has accidentally run over a member of the Sicilian Mafia. My dad barely escaped with his life. Fast forward to this morning to when my dad gets a letter in the mail saying that the mafia is going to kidnap and murder everyone in Lower Duck Pond. He told my mom and then left town.  #8203; Should we be worried?</TEXT>

    <TEXT>so a few days ago I made a post saying that I would do an epic skateboard jump over the city, right? Well yesterday morning I attempted to do the jump, and I ended up falling 40 feet into the river. Long story short, I got knocked unconscious, and I don't know where I am now. Can someone please help me?</TEXT>

    <TEXT>So today was my 7 year old brother's birthday, and I bought him a copy of Pokemon Diamond. He has been playing for the last 20-30 minutes. He chose Chimchar as his starter (he called him fire monkey) and he was about to catch a bidoof when my dad said that it was time for him to go to bed. HE TURNS THE DS OF WITHOUT SAVING! I honestly don't have the heart to tell him what happened.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>listen cinderace. You're only the 2nd best galar starter. Intellion is way better. Not only is water type cooler than fire, but Cinderace appeals to furries. FURRIES. The same people who draw porn of fucking animals. And have you seen Cinderace's fucking gigantamax form?1 Its fucking retarded! He's standing on his own fucking testicles. Intellion on the other hand, has just killed JFK. He will pop your testicles with his epic sniper and then do the epic victory royal dance. I have won this argument</TEXT>
