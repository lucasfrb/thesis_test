    <TEXT>Thank you for the fast response, however which module would you recommend to use, because the only reason I am moving away from pygame is because when used alongside Tkinter it is extremely slow, so are you aware that any of these modules would run faster than pygame would?</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Some more information about Spectium: The glasses continuously play a sound to the user, that varies in volume depending on the distance from an object around them. The distance is calculated using ultrasonic sensors, which bounces an ultrasonic sound wave at a high frequency and using the time it returns to calculate this. A calibration system app is used to determine the lowest point which the user can hear, in order to make it a better product for the blind, which is achieved by playing a sound progressively louder until the presses the stop button and this value is used as the bottom value when sounds are played to the user. A cut off point is implemented to prevent the device from being annoying, which is selected by the user, i.e if the cut-off point is 1 metre, then any object detected that is further than 1 metre is not played as a sound to the user until it becomes closer to them than this. Hopefully, this information helps, but if you have any specific questions I would love to answer! Now I am simply focussing upon making the innovation better and more suited to the blind, by making it more user-friendly, and I am achieving this in due accordance to manuals, books, videos and factsheets provided online, such as those from the RNIB (Royal National Institute Of Blind People, and so would love any additional advice!

    <TEXT>Thank you for the reply, and as a response, this is where my future ideas will come through: detecting the temperature of objects and alert blind people of this; Using surround sound to play sound, so you can map exactly where the object is; utilising machine learning and AI to determine whether an object is un-necessary to alert the user of, or necessary, for example, if a moving vehicle is beyond the cut-off point (so they wouldn't usually be told of it) they will be informed as the glasses can detect that it poses a danger to the user. And even currently, I am not aware of glasses that use bone conduction technology and solve this problem, which allows for better social integration, since one can hear their surroundings while being informed and also permits it to function for the deaf-blind. And so, therefore as a summary, even for those that can gain a basic spatial awareness without glasses, all of the extra information that the glasses can inform to the blind, I think is invaluable, and at no cost or inconveniences to them. How do you understand the temperature of objects around you on a day-to-day basis? And using your method of navigating, which I would love to know, by the way, does this allow you to map out the exact place of the objects as surround sound would? Thank you again for your excellent question!</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Yes, I understand and I really do appreciate the insight as it has been very difficult to receive advice or fully comprehend the issues that the blind face on a day to day basis due to coronavirus. However, regarding the temperature, I aim to integrate it to combat the issue of scalding from extremely high or low temperature, which I am unsure if you are able to detect, please tell me if you can and how if so. And also, have you seen bone conduction technology used in an innovation like this, such as the thing you described that you wear on your arm that you were referring to? Furthermore, about echolocation, this was where I originally got the concept for Spectium, since I thought it could be applied to this very concept for the blind, is there anything specifically you believe that I should look into about echolocation? Lastly, within your final sentence what did you mean by stating that '*these things never show up*', as in they are never created? Thank you so much again, this is super helpful!</TEXT>

    <TITLE>Feedback for a new idea to help blind and visually impaired before committing to it:</TITLE>
    <DATE>2020-07-02 19:54:15</DATE>
    <TEXT>I am a 14-year-old, and currently, I am looking at committing my time to program technology that will impact and improve the quality of life for the blind and visually impaired, after having previously come up with an idea, but now understood its irrelevance. And so, after having read and watched numerous videos and articles, I have decided to focus upon creating something that will make certain features in daily life more accessible to the blind. Subsequently, I noticed the problem of reading but mainly reading where the person does not know they need to read, which is described online as impossible. To elaborate further, an example could be a sign on a road, which a blind person cannot see, thus meaning they cannot read the information. Hence, I came up with the idea for a pair of glasses, which can read and detect that the sign is there and convert its text into audio, to convey to the user. Conceptually, I have not developed the idea massively, as first I would like to see whether it is a viable and relevant idea that would genuinely help, before fully committing to it, although, I imagine I will program an app to accompany it, to make it even more accessible, personalised and involve the user more. Therefore, I have a few questions: Would this idea genuinely help and improve the quality of life for the blind or is there a known way to achieve this, that is not mentioned online? If so, then what features would make it very useful. If not, then what technology would help impact your day to day life? Thank you for reading and any feedback would be much appreciated! :)</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I intended for the innovation to help read signs which you do not know are there, so the glasses sense that there is a sign, and turns the text into audio, an example was provided as a comment which fits the idea perfectly: *"arriving at a store, where they've hung some homemade sign out front that you weren't expecting...like right now, with COVID19, I went into a grocery store and asked an employee if there are any rules or anything I need to know about because I can't read signs and posters they put up in small print"* This is exactly what type of signs and information I would look to make it more convenient to read, as well as information for public transport such as if a train or bus is delayed. Hopefully, this helps clarify that. And so, do you believe this would help or is it too niche of a sector to look into?</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Thank you so much for this comment, as this is exactly what I was trying to convey as the primary goal for the glasses to achieve: reading signs which you do not realise are there. However, do you believe that this is too niche of a part to develop within? And overall, to reply to some of your concerns, regarding the battery life, I would look to make it as convenient as possible for the blind, by involving them in the process of creating it, so what battery life would you think to be best for an innovation such as this? Furthermore, about weight, it will feel and weigh similarly to normal glasses and, finally, the accuracy of translating from text to audio will definitely not be a problem. Lastly, overall I am not too worried about funding the idea, just moreover concerned with formulating the idea first, and then will hope to receive funding if I can develop a robust and relevant idea to help the blind. Thank you for the response!</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I have looked into Seeing Eye to some depth, and I believe that the major problem with it, is that the user must be aware of exactly what they are looking to read before using the app, whereas with the innovation I have proposed, it will simply read it for you, whether you are aware of its existence or not. Although, the app does recognise and achieve more. And finding a unique angle and developing an existing innovation is currently my aim, by developing and expanding upon modern technologies but making them more accessible and useful. Finally, your last comments are very interesting, as developing technology for those who can not speak definitely would be interesting, and useful for them, so I may look into this as well.

    <TEXT>I entirely agree with your thoughts for Navi Lens, and so this really does emphasise the use and notion of my innovation, since the glasses I propose do not require the tag or any other form of a material object to identify, but rather identifies what is currently there, such as a sign that sighted people view from and converts it into audio. Thus meaning that it is applicable to all cities, signs and countries without any need to add things to the area first. And your final comments in the first paragraph entirely is my aim since I intend to develop and expand off of modern technologies and concepts that already exist by making them more accessible. Furthermore, I would like to thank you for your kind words, although I simply am looking to make the world more sustainable through expanding from Bill Clinton's inspirational quote, *"We cannot build our own future without helping others to build theirs."*. And so, I am definitely looking to remain within this field of study and development of an idea to improve the quality of life for those who struggle on a day to day basis in some way.

Hopefully, this clarifies things. Moving on to your comments regarding creating more accessible games, I would love to create and achieve this, through integrating the use of image processing and OCR, but I do not know if I am able to achieve this as I have tinkered with the concept of image processing but found it far too difficult at the time to integrate (when I was working upon a different idea to help the blind). And so, do not know if I would be able to achieve this, do you know of a more interactive method of learning image processing outside of a textbook, to make it easier to learn?
