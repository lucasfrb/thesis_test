    <TITLE>PLEASE HELP - Am I faking being trans??</TITLE>
    <DATE>2020-02-12 07:30:07</DATE>
    <TEXT>I am so terrified that I am faking dysphoria and being trans, I don #8217;t understand what #8217;s wrong with my body and mind. I know I #8217;m not happy in this feminine body, and every time I think about taking steps backwards (like stopping wearing my binder/packer/letting my hair grow back out) I get really depressed; I just know I can #8217;t bring myself to go back to the way things were before I started living socially as a male. I still don #8217;t pass most of the time because I #8217;m short as fuck so the only people who gender me correctly are those that I tell, so I don #8217;t get to hear he/him as often as I like, I #8217;m afraid that I #8217;m unconsciously making my brain cringe when I hear  #8220;she/her #8221; and my deadname. I #8217;ve been on testosterone for 2 days and I think I can already feel bottom growth and thickening of the vocal chords happening. I thought I would be excited for these changes, but instead I am so scared. I remember my first puberty being just as terrifying and emotional, so maybe the panic and crying is normal when your hormones suddenly start changing, but I just thought this time around would be better. The day that I got my first T injection I was initially really scared, then I was elated all day, I felt an immediate rush of joy just from knowing testosterone was in my body. The next day, a few hours after I woke up, i noticed a sort of light tightness in my throat and a discomfort in my genital area. I immediately panicked, knowing that these changes are among the most permanent in a transition. (I #8217;m especially scared about bottom growth, I absolutely hate everything down there as is and I #8217;m scared that bottom growth will make it feel worse somehow.) I wasn #8217;t expecting anything to feel different in the first few days after my injection. I keep oscillating back and forth between feeling like this is good and right and then being horrified at myself and scared that I #8217;ll be stuck with permanent changes I tricked myself into thinking I wanted. I #8217;m not even sure if what I #8217;m feeling is real, I #8217;ve never heard of a trans guy who noticed changes before a week passed in his transition, maybe this is all just in my head and I #8217;m psyching myself out. I know it #8217;s not too late to stop if testosterone is wrong for me, but I #8217;ve waited and hoped for this for so long and I don #8217;t want to quit yet. Is this panic normal in the first few days or weeks of transition? When did it stop? Is this a warning sign that I #8217;m making a mistake?? It may also be worth noting that I #8217;ve also recently upped my Zoloft dosage because I have really bad general anxiety and my previous dosage wasn #8217;t effective enough. I can #8217;t say for sure if that #8217;s what #8217;s causing this greater amount of sensitivity, but i don #8217;t think it makes sense that an anti-depressant/anxiety medication would worsen my anxiety. Also I #8217;m taking a lowish weekly T shot, so this can #8217;t be caused by an excessive T dose. I #8217;m just afraid and I desperately need advice.</TEXT>

    <TITLE>Should I tell my girlfriend my deadname?</TITLE>
    <DATE>2020-05-09 03:44:43</DATE>
    <TEXT>So my girlfriend is incredibly supportive, I love her to pieces, and neither she nor I want her to know my deadname if at all possible. Unfortunately both of our parents, who we #8217;ve been forced to live with because of Corona, are pretty transphobic and my dad will only use my preferred name once in a while as a reward for favors (or whatever dumb excuse he has). Her mom is really manipulative and feels entitled to know my deadname, and demands that either I or my father tell her since I am dating her daughter. If she finds out what my deadname is, she will make sure that my girlfriend learns it too, and I doubt she will ever refer to me by my preferred name again. I have been planning to meet up with my girlfriend this weekend, and because my family has not been able to give me drivers lessons for situations I #8217;d rather not get into here, my dad has to drive me up to go see her. My girlfriend #8217;s mother says she will not let me see her daughter until she speaks to my father (about what I do not know, but I can take a wild guess). If she asks my deadname, I have no doubt my dad will tell her without a fuss. My girlfriend is miserable and really wants to see me, and I feel the same way and neither of us want me to cancel on her. She has told me many times before she #8217;d rather hear my deadname from me than anyone else if she has no other options, so I #8217;m wondering if I should suck it up and tell her, roll the dice and see if I can somehow escape my deadname being exposed, or simply cancel and subject both of us to be miserable and alone until the quarantine ends?</TEXT>

    <DATE>2020-05-18 08:24:35</DATE>
    <TEXT>Prolly a weird question but I learned that in cis men JOing does in fact lower T levels to a not-insignificant degree. Obviously there #8217;s a difference but I #8217;m worrying about it now, I can #8217;t find anything online that indicates whether or not trans men lose testosterone levels that way.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Alright might delete this later because I #8217;m like 90% sure I #8217;m in the right but I wanna be sure. So I #8217;m a bi dude, and I only semi-recently (like 5 months ago) realized this, my friend and I were chatting over snap and it came up that both of us had been harassed for wearing  #8220;gay shit #8221; (rainbows) when we #8217;re bi, and my friend was like  #8220;maybe that was wrong of us #8221; and then he got mad at me for saying  #8220;nah we #8217;re f*gs too #8221; and says he doesn #8217;t want to talk to me until he #8217;s calmed down even though I apologized. I get that maybe he didn #8217;t wanna be called that, but he chewed me out about not calling myself that either. AITA?</TEXT>

    <DATE>2020-05-26 04:10:02</DATE>
    <TEXT>I #8217;m going insane in lockdown with no reprieve from my dysphoria and I want a virtual consultation for top surgery to give me something to look forward to, but my options confuse me so much. I don #8217;t want my nips to be too centered or too big but I don #8217;t want scars to forever remind me that I #8217;m not cis. If I have to give up some feeling in my chest that #8217;s fine but my girlfriend really wants to touch me there and stuff and I want that too, I #8217;d be sad if I couldn #8217;t get any pleasure out of that kind of stimulation. I #8217;ve been trying to research my options but I keep getting contradictory results and besides there are complications no matter what I pic. Has anyone regretted their choice in top surgery? If you could do it again, would you have picked a different operation?</TEXT>

    <DATE>2020-05-26 09:17:47</DATE>
    <TEXT>My life has been a series of near comically timed misfortunes. I haven #8217;t been consistently happy since I was 9 years old because of the shit that happened to me. My mom died when I was 15 and my dad may not be a part of my life for much longer because I #8217;m bisexual and transgender (whoopdee fucking doo I won the lottery) and my sister makes me look like a clown by being literally the exact stereotype of a  #8220;triggered snowflake #8221; while also copying everything I do (To be clear I know she has trauma too and I disapprove of her being treated as if her feelings don #8217;t matter, but she acts like she #8217;s half her age and constantly lashes out at me no matter what I do). I went to college in the fall and got a girlfriend and I thought I was finally going to be happy when I met her family and then her fucking dad called two weeks later, 4 weeks before the quarantine, and said his wife and him didn #8217;t have what me and my girlfriend have and he left in the night and is currently trapped in Oregon with no money and no pills for his heart disease. Now I #8217;m here at home with my homophobic/transphobic dad and my entitled sister and my girlfriend is hours away from me miserable with her suffocatingly controlling mother who #8217;s lashing out at her for this whole situation. It #8217;s not fair. When is life going to give me a fucking break? If I don #8217;t get to go back to college and be with my girlfriend this year I #8217;m giving up.</TEXT>

    <DATE>2020-06-07 21:51:11</DATE>
    <TEXT>I #8217;ve been on T for 4 months and I #8217;ve had a really quick reaction, I #8217;m already much happier than before because I #8217;ve already gotten a masculine voice, muscle tone, and body and facial hair. I #8217;ve also noticed some weird changes that aren #8217;t really good or bad that I haven #8217;t really seen talked about, kinda just wanna share them and ask if anyone else has had these changes too. -Random shivers, especially in the morning. It doesn #8217;t bother me at all, but every day now I have lots of random shivers all over my body, especially in the morning. I #8217;ve heard this is a side affect of body hair growth, but who knows. -Sleeping on my stomach I #8217;m lucky to have a small chest and I always bind with at the very least a sporty, but never before T had I ever slept on my stomach, just my back and sides. Now I do it all the time and it #8217;s really comfortable. -Big appetite I #8217;m hungry all the time and it #8217;s actually really great because eating more has helped me gain weight and fill out better. -Skin texture Rougher, possibly thicker skin. It #8217;s nice, I personally hated being smooth and soft and I can touch my skin more comfortably now that it #8217;s tougher. Anyway I just hadn #8217;t seen these changes talked about and I thought they were interesting/weird, maybe some of these are just me lol</TEXT>

    <DATE>2020-06-11 03:31:55</DATE>
    <TEXT>Edit: I made this rant because I was basically ganged up on and forced to leave another mlm subreddit because I #8217;m trans. I left the subreddit and blocked the people who initiated it all, but I still wanted to be angry and I don #8217;t really have an outlet for that at all so I came here. Yes I lashed out, yes it was unfair. I don #8217;t really care if you think I #8217;m an ass for writing this, I needed to let it out at the time and even if it #8217;s selfish I did find a lot of the responses really positive and helpful, so thank you for that. I know my message got really muddled with my personal anger, but basically all I wanted to say was that trans men are real men and we vary wildly on an individual level both inwardly and outwardly. Not all trans men are assholes like me. We #8217;re not women masquerading as men. We #8217;re men and we always have been. Anyway I #8217;m leaving what I initially wrote unedited below, yes I know it #8217;s aggressive and yes I was trying to pump myself up in a moment of weakness. Doesn #8217;t matter anymore anyway This applies to probably more than 90% of you. I #8217;m so tired of explaining that I #8217;m not a bottom, but primarily a top, and I don #8217;t want ur dick anywhere but my mouth or ass. No, I am not a  #8220; #8221;diet-man. #8221; #8221; I #8217;m literally a man, the only reason you might tell the difference is because trans male bottom surgeries are rather lackluster. Too often I see people assume that trans men are all bottoms who love being fucked in their biological sex organ. Absolutely not, most of us do not want that ever and would much prefer being assfucked if we are open at all to bottoming. This isn #8217;t a choice. Why would it be a choice? My life is miserable and I wish every day that I might be stricken down so that nobody has to deal with me anymore. I absolutely guarantee that I am physically stronger than most of you, dysproria is a massive motivator and though I am only a 19 I am as muscled as an avid bodybuilder because I absolutely cannot stand even an ounce of femininity in my own body. It #8217;s not transphobic to not want to date a trans man, but you are dumb as fuck if you think trans men aren #8217;t real men. I #8217;m twice as man as you, I had to very literally fightnto be recognized as a man. Don #8217;t call me a woman or a fake man. You don #8217;t have to date me but I #8217;ll punch your fucking lights out if you call me a woman. Absolutely fuck you if you think that fuck off or meet up with me and discover what it feels like to be punched into next week. I #8217;m so angry I don #8217;t even care. Fuck off if you #8217;re triggered. Edit 2: this post isn #8217;t who I am. Don #8217;t assume you know me from this one instance, I have more emotions than anger. I #8217;m leaving this post here because I #8217;m not ashamed of my anger even when I use it unproductively, and I #8217;m here owning my mistake in lashing out indiscriminately even though this subreddit community isn #8217;t the one that directly hurt me. This post isn #8217;t about wanting a boyfriend either. I have a partner and while I understand why people think that #8217;s why I made this post, it isn #8217;t. I #8217;m angry because I #8217;ve been hurt. Just putting this second edit in because I #8217;m still getting comments from people who mistakenly assume that I #8217;m just this ball of hatred.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I don #8217;t care if you #8217;re a truscum or a tucute, it shouldn #8217;t matter in a conversation like this. My sister is legitimately faking everything (and I do mean fucking EVERYTHING) she does to be more like me. Its really frustrating. She #8217;s lied to me about girls she #8217;s had a crush on when I started lightly indicating that I was attracted to girls, and I know they #8217;re lies because it #8217;s stupid shit like Kim Possible (which she never watched because it stopped airing when she was like 6-7 and my parents allotted us 2 hours of tv every day until my sister was 11 so we always watched tv together) and batgirl (she #8217;s never seen any batgirl media, she watched me playing Batman Arkham knight and told me she had a crush on batgirl despite never having any interest in any comic book characters, which I avidly loved and pursued as a hobby). It #8217;s especially frustrating because I #8217;ve tried so fucking hard to be seen for who I am, it #8217;s not a choice for me, but it legitimately is for her. She #8217;s lied about everything for her whole life, she #8217;s constantly trying to be a victim. My family is fairly wealthy and she would lie to all the kids her age and say we were poor because she wanted their pity, and she stil does that even as a 15 year old. It #8217;s fucked. It disgusts me. And it makes me look worse in a conservative family that doesn #8217;t want to see lgbt people as anything other than attention seekers who are faking it. You better not come at me with  #8220;you #8217;re being prejudiced her identity is as valid as yours #8221; I #8217;ve tried so goddamn hard to understand her. She legitimately wants only to be a victim. She doesn #8217;t understand what dysphoria is like or how scary it is to know that the only option I have to be happy in a romantic/sexual relationship is with someone of the same sex. I #8217;d give literally anything to be cis/het, she #8217;d give anything to be a pitiable victim. This isn #8217;t an observation I #8217;ve made rashly, I #8217;ve ananlyzed her for as long as I #8217;ve been aware of her desire to be a victim. I can #8217;t have a relationship with her once I #8217;ve become an independent adult. I believe without a doubt that she would drag me down to  #8220;help #8221; her and offer nothing in return. Financially and emotionally, I can #8217;t support that. Getting the hormones and surgery #8217;s that I need is expensive as fuck. I don #8217;t owe her anything. I wish her the best but I can #8217;t be her fucking dad. I #8217;m my own person.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>People in general nowadays seem really obsessed with finding the perfect person who meets their every need. That #8217;s not realistic. Obviously your partner or potential partner is gonna slip up and be imperfect, but more than that, they #8217;re gonna be flawed. For example, I am insanely insecure and I often need reassurance to feel wanted. I know it #8217;s my problem, but I also know it #8217;s not gonna go away, it #8217;s something my partner and I deal with together. Do your best to realize your flaws and to compromise them as best you can. Don #8217;t intentionally be a weight on your partner #8217;s back, but trust them to be just fine carrying you along some of the time, and return that gesture in kind. As long as you and your partner can agree that the arrangement is mutually beneficial, you #8217;re doing just fine.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>It #8217;s been hard for me to come to terms with bisexuality. As a trans man I used to fear all the time that if I dated a bisexual person that they would see me as the wrong gender. I realized that was an issue I had with myself, not bisexual people, and I have since grown to feel so grateful for the ability of bisexual people to love me. My bisexual girlfriend taught me a lot. Love that girl.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I #8217;m 4 months on T and for the past day and a half I #8217;ve had a really dull ache in my throat that comes and goes but is always there when I swallow food. I can #8217;t even really place where in my throat it hurts, but it #8217;s really annoying and I have to grunt or grit my teeth every time I swallow food and it makes eating with my family weird and uncomfortable. I looked online and apparently soreness of the throat is common in male puberty, but I #8217;m not sure I #8217;d describe this pain as soreness, it #8217;s not always there but it comes and goes often enough that I didn #8217;t get the chance to fall asleep last night. Should I go to a doctor or is this normal?</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I #8217;m tired of subreddits like this using their context as an excuse to be bigoted Title really says it all, but I will explain. In subreddits like this one r/offmychest and r/unpopularopinion people will say really ignorant things without exploring the topic in depth and it infuriates me to see those posts have several thousand upvotes. I #8217;ve just come from a post on r/unpopularopinion that was talking about how gay people who marry straight people are assholes. Not only is this an extremely popular opinion, hence why it has several thousand updoots, but it #8217;s also really ill-informed and doesn #8217;t explore the reasons why someone would end up in that situation. It doesn #8217;t consider that there exist countries where gay people are killed for being themselves. It doesn #8217;t consider that maybe the gay person is in denial or confused. It doesn #8217;t consider that it could be a mistake. Gay people are attracted to the same goddamn sex, they don #8217;t put themselves in that situation on purpose. I remember a post from a teacher on this subreddit about black Americans being at fault for being in their current situation because they #8217;re all little assholes in school or some shit. The logic behind this is so backwards, it starts with a conclusion and then searches for reasons to support that conclusion which is the opposite of how logic works (if you disagree this is an objective fact look it up). I #8217;ve gone way off on a tangent and I #8217;m tired of being angry so I #8217;m gonna stop now, feel free to tel me to fuck off or whatever, dipshits.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>What? Privilege is literally just something that helps people get by easier than others. For example, a person in a first world country can go to a store or a food bank to get food, a person in a third world country almost definitely doesn #8217;t consistently have that option. Easy access to food is a privilege. And in that situation specifically you can donate to relief programs to help. In general privilege just needs to be acknowledged so that people don #8217;t abuse it. It #8217;s abused when people do things like be more suspicious of black people in general than white people in general, tell everyone who isn #8217;t white to go  #8220;back where they came from, #8221; speak out against gay marriage, and so on. Obviously not everyone does this, because not everyone abuses their privilege.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I didn #8217;t say that it was. Privilege exists in multiple ways. It #8217;s a privilege to be straight instead of gay because of homophobia and the higher rates of violence against gay people. Its a privilege to be able to walk instead of sit in a wheelchair because it gives you more opportunities in jobs and in life and you don #8217;t have to rely on being thought about when maneuvering since so many places are inaccessible to wheelchairs. It #8217;s a privilege to be wealthy and to be able to have access to whatever you need whenever you need it. These things stack. A person can be gay, wheelchair bound, and poor all at once, and anyone who is straight, able to walk, and wealthy/not poor is at least 3x as privileged as that specific person regardless of race. Also, analogies aren #8217;t meant to  #8220;prove #8221; concepts, they #8217;re meant to make the concept easier to understand by giving it a new angle to perceive it with. Yours didn #8217;t prove your argument either for the same reason.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Almost no one in the dating scene claims to be open to everyone. They just say they #8217;re looking, that doesn #8217;t mean the first person they find is  #8220;the one. #8221; And yes it does in the majority of cases, if you are aware of the advantages you have you #8217;re far less likely to abuse them. Privileges are abused when people do things like be suspicious of black people and never/almost never other races, speak out against gay marriage, tell people of other races to  #8220;go back where they came from, #8221; and so on. When you generally don #8217;t have to worry about things like having the police called on you for no reason, not being able to marry your significant other, or having someone hurt/harass you because you #8217;re a different race you have to be aware of and grateful for that in order to be able to participate in stopping these things from happening where possible and to avoid doing them yourself. You don #8217;t gotta apologize to do that, you just gotta quietly admit these truths to yourself</TEXT>

No I #8217;m not virtue signaling (hardly anyone but you is gonna see this conversation anyway) I #8217;m having a conversation with you because I #8217;m bored as hell. You literally didn #8217;t understand what an analogy was since you misinterpreted what an analogy was supposed to do for an argument. I am exercising critical thought you #8217;re just refusing to listen to it. I didn #8217;t say that anyone who succeeds owes anyone else anything, but it would be helpful and nice and not selfish if they did help out the less fortunate. Privilege isn #8217;t exclusive to race. Like I said, people can be privileged in multiple ways. A straight wealthy man who is able to walk is 3x as privileged as a gay poor wheelchair bound man, even if the wealthy man is black and the wheelchair bound man is white.</TEXT>

If you can #8217;t go on like you are happily, then it #8217;s best for you to transition. If what you have now is good enough and more important to you than being happier in your body, you need to have a longer conversation with yourself about what exactly you #8217;re feeling.

    <TEXT>I think it makes sense in situations where people are saying shit like  #8220;gay/black/disabled/[other minority] people are stupid #8221; pretending like that #8217;s an opinion and not hatred. I know putting it in such blatant terms seems obvious but people will often find ways to rephrase  #8220;I don #8217;t like this type of person #8221; into  #8220;based on my experiences it is my belief that this type of person should be treated this way and here #8217;s why #8221; You feel me? Don #8217;t care if the  #8220;opinion #8221; is popular or unpopular, if someone #8217;s gonna say shit like that they deserve all the backlash they get because this subreddit isn #8217;t a soap box for hate speech or  #8220;diet #8221; hate speech. Other than that we #8217;re in agreement. To be clear, I don #8217;t mean people should never get political or socially political on this sub. That stuff is fine.

My friend, James, is a trans man in the military and he plans to serve until he #8217;s found out. He #8217;s told friends and they don #8217;t really care. The problem he has is getting his testosterone on time. If he #8217;s deployed into another country for combat getting his weekly T doses is really difficult and he says he understands why that would keep trans people from the military, even though he thinks that was not at all the motive behind the law #8217;s enactment. He pointed out that other people with mental illnesses which require medication also have this problem and they are often barred from service simply because of the unavailability for their medication in combat.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Well I appreciate the last sentiment but you do know it is possible for trans people to switch up the parts they have, right? I wasn #8217;t born with a dick but I have one and my chest is flat, I don #8217;t have any of the organs that you would argue make me  #8220; #8221;female. #8221; #8221; And there are tons of trans dudes like me. The ones who aren #8217;t are on their way to getting where I am or get as close as they can. I don #8217;t know a whole lot about mtf surgeries and the like but I know they can be changed just as drastically and the ones that I know are happy with their decisions, and so am I. If there was an easier way we would absolutely take it, but there isn #8217;t a way to  #8220;fix #8221; us other than giving us the body we were always intended to have. Dysphoria isn #8217;t like schizophrenia, it #8217;s not an imbalance of chemicals or electro activity, it #8217;s an issue to do with the structure of the brain mismatching the sex of the body. You can #8217;t survivably change the brain structure like you can chemical imbalance or neural activity, but if you could I #8217;d have done it. Anyway point being a lot of the time trans people are indistinguishable from people who were born happy with their assigned gender, and if they aren #8217;t they #8217;re doing their best and they #8217;ll get there. If you saw a trans woman and thought she was hot without knowing she #8217;s trans, it #8217;s because you #8217;re straight. If you found out she #8217;s trans, still straight. Do you understand?</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I don #8217;t know if you #8217;re trans or not, but if you aren #8217;t you have no right to tell me or OP what is or isn #8217;t transphobic. Your previous comment makes no sense because you called me transphobic for not dating a trans person but you know literally nothing about me you #8217;re just calling me names and taking the meaning out of that word. It #8217;s an important word and firing it off without any reason devalues it and makes you look stupid. It #8217;s not transphobic to not date a trans person because they #8217;re trans. Just like it #8217;s not racist to not date a specific race because they are that race, or not ableist to not date someone who #8217;s disabled. It #8217;s just more than most people can handle, and they don #8217;t owe us their emotional investment in our lives or their bodies or whatever you seem to expect of them. It sucks that people have those prefences, yeah, but it #8217;s not like they have them on purpose. As long as the Individuals they aren #8217;t attracted to are still respected by the person, it #8217;s ok. OP has been extremely respectful and says he feels bad for feeling the way he does, but it #8217;s not intentional. Step off your high horse</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Have you told him everything you #8217;ve said here? There #8217;s not much else you can do. If saying this (like ALL of it and whatever relevant details you #8217;re leaving out) doesn #8217;t change anything, I think you #8217;re going to have to bite the bullet and have a serious conversation with yourself about whether or not your marriage is sustainable. It may also be worth asking him if he #8217;s been hooking up with anyone else, I find it a little strange that he seems so unaffected by the lack of physical intimacy in your relationship as you #8217;ve described him. It gets more suspicious with him allowing you to hook up with others which you have said is extremely out of character. Have you confronted him about potentially cheating on you? Have you asked to see his phone and his messages? If you ask for his phone receipts while you have serious and understandable concerns (like you do now) and he #8217;s protective of it, that #8217;s a big red flag. Your happiness and satisfaction are important and these are your needs, you aren #8217;t being petty. If he can #8217;t give you a consistent straight answer I think you have every right to be upset and even suspicious. I don #8217;t want to say your husband is selfish, I have no idea what #8217;s causing him to act like he is, but his needs aren #8217;t any more important than yours, and you have been immensely considerate to be chaste for his sake for an ENTIRE YEAR. You #8217;ve gone above and beyond. He owes you an explanation and you owe yourself a relationship that is satisfactory for both you and your partner. I hope you can figure out what #8217;s wrong and figure out the next logical step</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Well the first rumor you should dispose of is that it has to hurt. It definitely doesn #8217;t. Use twice as much lube as you think is  #8220;enough #8221;, and let your partner know if you #8217;re scared, it #8217;s their job to loosen you up and make you comfortable so that your body is physically ready before penetrative sex. (This can be done with rimming and fingering, which are both great alone and as a  #8216;warmup #8217;). I #8217;d personally recommend your first time being with someone you trust, but it #8217;s not a problem if it isn #8217;t. It doesn #8217;t make you any less worthy or anything if you have recreational sex, but it definitely hits different when it #8217;s with someone you really care about Edit: Also! If you #8217;re gonna be sexually active get checked at least every month or so for STDs it #8217;s way better if you catch em early. Also don #8217;t be scared of herpes almost every sexually active person has it and it #8217;s not the scary deadly monster that people make it out to be. At worst you #8217;ll get a few red marks and/or bumps on your junk to go with the ones you were born with and nobody will notice a thing. The first flare up is the worst one you #8217;ll have if it #8217;s bad at all</TEXT>

    <TITLE>Important: protecting trans youth</TITLE>
    <DATE>2020-07-28 19:50:40</DATE>
    <TEXT>There #8217;s something that #8217;s become glaringly obvious to me that I #8217;m not seeing talked about. All of us as trans folks have either experienced fetishism firsthand or have the potential to just because of who we are. This fetishism is far too commonly paired with manipulation of and targeting of minors. Trans kids, especially pre-HRT trans kids or trans kids early in their transition are really easy to manipulate because of naivety but also, more importantly, because affirmation of their identities is a really powerful tool that works really well for groomers and manipulators. TikTok is a minefield for trans kids, there are creepy fuckers all over the place and more than a few of them know that targeting trans kids is especially effective because having someone with big numbers behind their name say  #8220;wow you #8217;re so handsome/pretty/androgynous/whatever #8221; means so gd much to them. Transmasculine people have the added danger of generally looking younger than they are, which doubles the fetish factor for nasty pedos. Transfeminine people are targets too, absolutely, but for the specific pedo trans fetishizers who are all too common on tiktok, trans men are often a more enticing target because of their younger appearance. If you see someone on TikTok or anywhere else targeting kids, trans or otherwise, you have a responsibility to expose that person and protect the kids who don #8217;t know any better. And to any kids reading this, nobody who really cares about you will ask you to do anything that makes you uncomfortable. People who try really hard to get into your good graces and ask for something in return aren #8217;t doing that out of the kindness of their hearts. They want something from you. I don #8217;t want to lecture but it #8217;s really scary how easily some of these TikTok predators are able to manipulate kids, especially lgbt and ESPECIALLY trans kids. Play it safe and don #8217;t accept the friendship of someone online who is 18+ if you are a minor. That #8217;s all, protect our youth and utilize the stability of our community to back one another up, especially the youngest of us.</TEXT>

I #8217;ve known since I was very very little that I wanted to adopt my kids if I have any but that was largely due to me just being so dysphoric all the time. Are you sure you mean you want to be able to give birth? Or do you just mean you wish biological kids with your partner were a possibility? Sorry to snoop but it seems from your post history that you #8217;re thinking you might be a trans woman, correct?</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Um no. The DSM-5 is written by scientists whose field is neurobiology and psychology and they have confirmed time and time again that being trans is real and can tell a person is trans if they have gender dysphoria, which is caused by the development of the brain into a structure that doesn #8217;t match the sex of the body. The human brain is the most complex object in the known universe, it shouldn #8217;t be at all surprising that sometimes it develops a different sex than the body.</TEXT>

That #8217;s freedom of speech and freedom of expression. Gay people haven #8217;t always had that in many places and still don #8217;t in many others. In places where gay people can legally be vocal about their identity, the people who don #8217;t like hearing about The Gays pay more attention to it and fool themselves into thinking it happens more often than it actually does.

    <TEXT>Doesn #8217;t matter, he should just mind his own business, if women with newborn babies are free to blab about their babies or sports fans free to make everything in their life about sports, then lgbt people are allowed to make their identities just as important in their personal lives. It #8217;s a freedom that lgbt people haven #8217;t always had in some places and a freedom that many still don #8217;t have in other places. In the same vein, it #8217;s OP #8217;s right to complain and it #8217;s my right to call out his shitty opinion. Also, if you #8217;re on r/unpopularopinion at all you #8217;ll learn really quick that the title is exactly what the person means and the description is almost ALWAYS some kind of backtracking disclaimer so they don #8217;t have to deal with counter-arguments. If this is a rare case of OP not really meaning what #8217;s in the title, any misunderstandings of his intentioned meaning are 100% his fault and not the reader #8217;s. The basis of rhetoric is to convince the person you #8217;re talking to, not giving them a bunch of pieces of a problem and expecting them to figure it out.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Yep. It #8217;s also confirmation bias. For example, Bigoted Person sees gay people talking about being gay and comes to the conclusion:  #8220;gay people are just so damn annoying about being gay, it #8217;s all they talk about #8221; and then every time he observes another gay person talking about being gay Bigoted Person says:  #8220;aha! I was right, here it is, happening again. #8221; But the thing is! In all likelihood, Bigoted Person would never have known these people were gay if they were not talking about it, since it #8217;s not something physical or visible. This also means that if gay people want to find other gay people, they have to talk about being gay! It #8217;s not all some plot to annoy straight people lmfao</TEXT>

I #8217;d want to know why she doesn #8217;t do that too. Plus, if your daughter asks a question she deserves an answer. She #8217;s a kid, yes, but she #8217;s also an intelligent person who has enough maturity to think and feel on the same level that you do in many situations. It #8217;s understandable that she got angry after being ignored or brushed off. (Awful ironic of you to tell her to be polite while ignoring her and letting your girlfriend ignore the waiters, by the way.) It #8217;s your fault and your girlfriend #8217;s fault for letting the situation escalate, but that didn #8217;t give your daughter the right to yell. If you had just told her why yelling was wrong and apologized for your girlfriend #8217;s attitude, you would be fine. But you didn #8217;t and now YTA.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I #8217;d say there #8217;s problems for both that favor one over the other separately. Like how girls have to abide by a really strict dress code whereas the boys pretty much get a free pass unless they #8217;re actually indecent. Women in general and not just girls in school are treated like it #8217;s impossible for them to make a man uncomfortable by advancing on him. Obviously that #8217;s not true but people will often just laugh or even call a man lucky if he receives unwanted advances from a woman or even if he #8217;s assaulted by a woman. Also pedophilia is treated like it #8217;s not that big of a deal when an adult woman has sex with a boy. It #8217;s equally bad and damaging and manipulative as a grown man having sex with a girl.</TEXT>

You #8217;re not the one who has to figure anything out, and you sound like a great girlfriend. I #8217;m sure he #8217;ll love your gift</TEXT>

    <TEXT>That #8217;s because you #8217;ve always been allowed to be those things freely and without consequences. It was only 2015 that gay marriage was legalized across the United States. That #8217;s only 5 years ago, and there are plenty of countries where gay marriage still isn #8217;t legal. Plus Trump just made it legal for transgender people to be rejected medical treatment of any kind just because a doctor is transphobic. It #8217;s not like anyone #8217;s telling you that you have to go to pride parades. Just mind your own business and move on with your day. If someone wants to talk about being gay or celebrate it who gives a fat shit let them be happy. In all likelihood their lives have been much less happy and much more difficult than yours why shouldn #8217;t they be proud of making it as far as they have?</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Don #8217;t have a single news source, and research the reliability and political lean of news sources when you use them. NEVER believe an article without sources or an article that only sources other articles from the same news source. A surefire way to get a mixed bag of polical leans is to just go to google and click  #8220;news. #8221; That #8217;s it. You #8217;ll get a bunch of articles from a bunch of different sources. If you want to get news about a specific thing, like coronavirus, you look up the thing in google and click  #8220;news. #8221;</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I #8217;m not saying all of Disney is bad. Obviously you didn #8217;t read the whole article. He also hosted a known Nazi propagandist and filmmaker, Leni Riefenstahl, and gave her a tour of Disney Studios. He also made a film that was so racist that it #8217;s no longer available anywhere unless you really dig deep into the internet. I #8217;m not saying to cancel Disney, either.

    <TEXT>More sources is always better and you can look up the credibility of the authors and editors of the articles if you #8217;re concerned. If they #8217;re often sketchy people will call them out on it. Also, just google  #8220;is [news source] reliable #8221; or  #8220;[news source] credibility #8221; or something like that and usually you #8217;ll get a) the news source #8217;s explanation of how they pick and deliver their stories and make sure that their facts are accurate and b) articles debunking false info if some exist. There are websites dedicated to documenting the mistakes news sources make and basically just delivering information on the consistency and validity of news sources. [Here is one.](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/msn-com/) The same website also has a [blacklist](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/fake-news/) of consistently unreliable news sites to avoid. They also have a [list of good sources](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/pro-science/) that consistently site qualified scientists and researchers and individual breakdowns for pretty much every news source. This is just one website you can use to check on news providers, there are others if for whatever reason you don #8217;t like this one or want a second opinion.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>No that #8217;s not how it works, Neanderthals and humans branched off separately and treated one another like we treat other countries, foreign but not necessarily enemies. The weren #8217;t behind us in evolution, they died off for largely unknown reasons but those reasons are attributed to a change in climate making their diets unsustainable and from interbreeding with Homo sapiens too much. There was a last Neanderthal because their species died out, but if they had gone on existing they #8217;d have evolved and would someday also develop into a new species.

    <TEXT>Ok basically, It #8217;s Complicated tm I #8217;m a bisexual trans man and I have a really conservative family and it #8217;s just as awesome as it sounds. Before I came out to myself as trans I knew I was attracted to women and I dated a girl in high school. My family called me a f-ggot to my face and so did someone random seeing me put an arm over her. Not really sure why, but I didn #8217;t get the d-slur much at all. Since then I #8217;ve transitioned and been in a relationship with a man and gone to college. My family wasn #8217;t around so things weren #8217;t as bad but I still got called a f-g and the like because there are a bunch of dumbass cowboys who go to my school because they have a great agriculture program. The origin of the f-slur is for the wood used to burn homosexuals at the stake, the  #8220;fags #8221; are the little sticks that start the fire and that #8217;s why European people call cigarettes  #8220;fags. #8221; Men were burnt at the stake way more than women because society has always seen intimacy between women as far more normal than intimacy between men, and moving forward that meant that the word was used to throw insults at homosexual men far more than women firmly solidifying the connotation to gay men who have gay sex and not really gay women as much. Basically, the word isn #8217;t inherently referencing gay men but it #8217;s been used far more against men for arbitrary reasons. If a gay/bi girl gets called the f-slur, she has a right to reclaim it in my opinion. If she was teleported back to the time that gay people were burnt at the stake and got caught doing something sexual with another girl, she would be burnt to death just like a gay man.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Something I #8217;ve learned as a young adult is that every parent fucks up their kids at least a little bit. Parents are human and humans are flawed, and every parent will fail to completely prepare their child for the world. The best way to raise a stable adult is to be honest, kind, stern but forgiving, and morally available for them. They #8217;ve gotta do their own growing up, just be a structure for them to lean on and hold on to as they start to grow apart from you.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Hey, fellow trans guy here! You #8217;re actually my senior in the transition process, but this advice should be helpful regardless. The rules for trans folks aren #8217;t any different for cis folks. Be honest and open and people will fill the spaces you feel are empty if you are open and allow them to get to know you. If you #8217;re looking for a relationship with more depth than just a fuckbuddy, it #8217;s honestly best to just surround yourself with people you want to be friends with. Most long-lasting relationships start with friendships anyway, but don #8217;t let that be the goal in mind. It #8217;s a lot better for you mentally and emotionally in general to go into relationships with new people without any expectations. Make friendships with other gay/bi men. If you feel like you want more than a friendship, make your move. Ask respectfully if that #8217;s something he would be interested in. If he declines, give him space but make it known you respect his decision as his friend. If you just want to casually make your way into the dating scene, maybe Grindr would be a good place to start for you. Regardless, you #8217;re a man and you don #8217;t have to do anything special to fill your role as one in a relationship.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Yeah, I get it, I #8217;ve been there too. The thing is, that #8217;s not how being a partner is supposed to work. You shouldn #8217;t have to give and give endlessly while your  #8220;partner #8221; gives nothing in return. Giving should feel good. It shouldn #8217;t feel like  #8220;I have less now, #8221; it should feel like  #8220;now we share more. #8221; What you have going on isn #8217;t sustainable. For what it #8217;s worth, he #8217;s probably going through a lot trying to navigate his identity. Being trans is anything but easy. It doesn #8217;t justify being a negligent partner, but it #8217;s possible he #8217;s gotten so wrapped up in taking care of himself that he #8217;s forgotten to take care of you too. If you haven #8217;t talked to him in depth about the way you #8217;re feeling, you definitely should. He can #8217;t change if he isn #8217;t aware of needing to change. If he tells you he can #8217;t do more than what he #8217;s doing now, that #8217;s your cue to get out. You #8217;re supposed to be his partner, not his mom.</TEXT>

I #8217;ve actually made a friend using dating apps because we went on a few dates and decided we weren #8217;t right as partners but that we liked one another platonically. I #8217;d try Bumble, it #8217;s usually more serious than Tinder which lesbians tend to use more for hookups, I #8217;ve noticed. You can also find LGBT centers in your city and schedule a therapy session or a group therapy session or just go to a meetup day. Sometimes these services are free, it all depends on the individual center. If you feel like you #8217;re in danger the LGBT center should be able to help you out or at least point you to someone who can. Point is you have options. This will be a positive change for you. You deserve someone who loves you as much as you love them.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Clearly you don #8217;t know what an opinion piece is. These are facts, there is evidence. Also Mitt Romney is not a rhino the fuck are you talking about? The only person who #8217;s said that besides you is Trump himself. Trump says a lot of baseless things, get used to it buddy. And while I agree that the nursing home thing was a bad move, it #8217;s not just old people that are dying from Covid. The biggest group of deaths are attributed to those aged between 40-70. Your suggestion that these politicians would kill people to make Trump look bad is ridiculous and baseless. Obviously they need to be held accountable for their bad decisions but they aren #8217;t trying to make people die, they #8217;re trying to prevent the spread of Covid. It #8217;s also pretty plausible that Covid had a foothold in nursing homes before the states went into lockdown. Either way the nursing home move was certainly a bad one. And please, go ahead and tell me Trump #8217;s accomplishments. I haven #8217;t even gotten into the things he #8217;s made worse, literally all I #8217;ve given you is the illegal and impeachable offenses he #8217;s done. The things he #8217;s fucked up is a whole other point of concern.</TEXT>

She #8217;s been confused and had probably been going through a lot of these emotions too. This isn #8217;t your fault and it #8217;s not really hers either, it just is what it is. That said, you do need to prioritize yourself at this point. If I were you I #8217;d talk to your wife about needing to separate and wanting to share custody. You both can love your son separately. My girlfriend had parents who stayed together for her and her experience was really horrible, you shouldn #8217;t force yourself to be with someone you #8217;ve grown resentful towards.

    <TEXT>This is awesome. I #8217;m really sad about how the quality of most new Marvel comics has just fucking tanked. Usually I #8217;m all for diversity but the way that these people have been using diversity is really underhanded and racist/sexist/transphobic/etc. Like people of color, women, LGBT people are always delicate and in need of saving and never ever the villain (like they changed the races of some villains that are supposed to be black or brown). It really comes off like your racist Boomer uncle talking about how fragile and inflammatory minorities are. Like chill tf out guys were people. If anyone at all criticizes the writers/artists all of them will get up in arms and sick their followers on you. It #8217;s really sad, I want to support the dying medium of comic books but I #8217;m not gonna buy trash books that are racist/homophobic/whatever and boring. DC seems to be mostly okay but I have seen some trash from them too. Either way I love this comic!</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Well some people are naturally that size. You don #8217;t ever see models with fat rolls, you see models who are chubby and stuff. For example you have people like native Hawaiians and Pacific Islanders. Evolution selected those who have genes to hold on to as much body fat as possible all the time because the islands had limited food and periods of starvation were common. Also, some people have disorders that prevent their bodies from creating the chemical that gives you the feeling of being full. Furthermore, unhealthy foods are the cheapest and there are a lot of low-income people who have to (yes HAVE to) eat unhealthy foods for every meal just to get their calories because of budgeting issues. I think it #8217;s great that these kinds of people are being told that they #8217;re normal and capable of being beautiful. If someone is financially stable and doesn #8217;t have some kind of genetic hinderance that keeps them from losing weight efficiently, yeah it #8217;s bad and there isn #8217;t an excuse for it. But if it makes them happy to see a plus sized model, who am I to spit on that? If they want to change they can. But being made to feel ugly won #8217;t help, it #8217;s a decision that has to be made for oneself.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Well then my friend who I took to the hospital for a cracked rib must have gotten some special kind of corset then? Binding the ribs causes damage, it #8217;s something that trans people are warned about all the time. Fashion stuff for women throughout history often asks too much of them and their bodies. Like geishas in China, who had their feet folded and bound as children to make their feet  #8220;cute and small #8221; and making it nearly impossible for them to walk on their own in the process. [Here](https://www.rcseng.ac.uk/library-and-publications/library/blog/effects-of-the-corset/) is a link to an article showing how corsets damage the body. If worn often enough, and many women wore them all day every day (usually upper class women), the corset warps the rib cage in a manner that pushes together internal organs. There is a display skeleton from a real woman whose torso was reshaped by the constant use of a corset.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>This article shows that women binding their ribs wither corsets bound themselves so taughtly that they could massively reduce their waist size. [This is only possible by compressing the rib cage to the point of reshaping it](https://www.rcseng.ac.uk/library-and-publications/library/blog/effects-of-the-corset/). Many women, especially high-class women, wore corsets regularly every day. Doing that every day inevitably causes rib damage and a warping of the rib cage.

    <TEXT>Hey I #8217;m open to learning but I #8217;ve literally had an in person experience of seeing my trans feminine friend cracking a rib because of a corset. I don #8217;t really appreciate being talked down to so much. The first thing you said to me was  #8220;myth #8221; with zero explanation like I wasn #8217;t even worth talking to, so of course I #8217;m gonna be on the defensive. If you #8217;d come at me like  #8220;hey actually it #8217;s like this and yeah they can be dangerous but they usually aren #8217;t #8221; I #8217;d be far more inclined to believe you. Not trying to lecture here I #8217;m just tired of you talking to me like I #8217;m bothering you when YOU initiated the conversation. I #8217;ll be the first to say I snapped back at you a bit but I was only matching your tone. Edit: I just looked and the person who sent  #8220;myth #8221; was someone else, my bad. I thought I #8217;d only been talking to you the whole time</TEXT>

    <TEXT>This belongs on r/asktrans Trans men rarely refer to their junk with feminine terms and there aren #8217;t many of us who are comfortable with penetrative sex but some trans men are. Not all of us are bottoms, either. From what I #8217;ve seen most of us are tops or at least switches. In the future maybe pick a better place to ask these kinds of questions because your question was invasive and uninvited and used dysphoria-triggering terminology but I hope my answer helped.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>It #8217;s not like it #8217;s the kid #8217;s fault. Whose to say it #8217;s not OP #8217;s fault in creating the potential for ODD by being a resentful parent? At least OP is self aware but he doesn #8217;t get any pity from me. It #8217;s his fault and he knows it. Negligent parenting is one of the core causes of ODD. He was probably too afraid of being alone and gave his wife a kid instead of losing her to someone who shared her goals. I know I #8217;m filling empty blanks in the narrative here but I #8217;m seeing zero potential for OP to be a victim. I will repeat though, credit for being self-aware.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I #8217;m not entirely sure what you #8217;re asking, but I think you #8217;re basically asking what it feels like to be in love? It doesn #8217;t feel like you #8217;re in love 100% of the time. It feels like you #8217;re happier in that person #8217;s presence and you think about them a lot when they #8217;re gone. Sometimes it feels like nothing at all and then that person will do something that just makes you glow and you remember  #8220;oh yeah. I #8217;m in love with you. #8221; If you #8217;re VERY in love you may have withdrawal symptoms while that person is away, but that #8217;s very rare early in a sexual/romantic relationship. It sounds like you #8217;ve experienced what I #8217;ve always called  #8220;budding love, #8221; like starting to fall for someone, but never let it get serious. You should give someone a chance. If they like you and treat you well, why not? I hope this is helpful, your question was a bit vague.</TEXT>

Unfortunately pansexuality started out as pretty transphobic, setting trans and non-binary people aside as a  #8220;third option #8221; and essentially invalidating binary trans people #8217;s identities. People have corrected this thinking since then, identifying as pan isn #8217;t a problem anymore, but essentially any definition you give to pan vs bi overlaps so much that there isn #8217;t really a distinct difference</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Police officers don #8217;t get to be judge, jury, and executioners. If they #8217;re defending their lives that #8217;s one thing but they have more resources than their guns. Even people who we are near certain to be criminals need to go through the proper justice system. This is regardless of color. Police brutality/excessive force is an issue whether the person is white or of color and regardless of whether the person is guilty or innocent. That woman jumping up and down is the mother of the children in the car who called the cops and she was begging the officers not to shoot him in front of her children. I never said that the cops were there for no reason or that Blake was innocent. I was not aware he was armed, this changes things, but even then what he had was a knife and police officers have tasers, blunt force weapons, and hand-to-hand training, and with multiple men there dealing with Blake shouldn #8217;t have been an issue. It is LAZY and IRRESPONSIBLE to decree that these officers did nothing wrong. Court hearings are comprised of dozens of people because no one person or one group of people can be reasonably given the power to determine a criminal #8217;s fate. Police officers should be held to that same standard. Also, to answer your question, whites make up 70% of the population so of course more shootings happen to a bigger group. I #8217;m sure you #8217;ve heard the statistics before. Regardless, I will repeat this: police brutality and excessive force in any context with any individual is reprehensible</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Of course you do. But the people you detain also have the right to life. Clearly that confrontation went on beyond the moment where Blake was shot, I can #8217;t find more footage of it online but if what you say is accurate there should have been more than enough time for officers to incapacitate him before he went for the car. Even while he was walking to the car, he had his back turned and could have been incapacitated by the officers physically without great risk of harm to the officers. I understand this man resisted arrest and was a threat to the officers involved, but officers shouldn #8217;t go for the gun as a primary option. Officers sign up for the job they have knowing the risks involved. If a cop isn #8217;t prepared to be injured by a criminal (not killed, I maintain that all people have a right to life), the cop should take up a different career. America #8217;s police shootings and its amount of people incarcerated are excessively beyond all other developed countries, that data is empirical and proves that reform is needed on multiple levels of management. Police aren #8217;t the only ones to blame and there are lots of officers who haven #8217;t used excessive force, but they are still a part of a dysfunctional system that is practically begging for repair. Also, side note. I know I #8217;m not alone when I say that truly guilty people deserve jail time. For people who would otherwise get a life sentence, a police shooting is often too good for them as a punishment, and once again it puts too much power in the hands of the officer.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I remember the story of Job being told to me as a kid and not understanding why Satan was the bad guy. God was literally bragging to Satan about his follower Job, who was an upstanding guy with a good manner of wealth but who was also generous and empathetic. Satan was like  #8220;cool story bro but he only loves you because you #8217;ve favored him with wealth, health, and a good life. #8221; God was like  #8220;aight bet #8221; and then God  #8220;tested #8221; Job #8217;s faith by killing his livestock, his servants, his 10 children, and burning all his property. Job basically went mad with grief but still prayed to and worshipped God. When Job #8217;s wife was like  #8220;Job God hates us why you praying to this bitch #8221; God was like  #8220;aha time for more tests! #8221; So God gave him a severe case of leprosy so that Job was near death, and Job #8217;s wife and friends all came to Job #8217;s side and told him to denounce God and let his soul go to rest. Job was scared and angry and asked  #8220;God why are you doing this I #8217;ve been good and kind but I #8217;m suffering and there are evil people who are doing just fantastic right now #8221; so God basically told Job  #8220;quit being a little bitch here #8217;s some bravery #8221; and gave him more earthly things to replace the ones taken from Job. But this doesn #8217;t make any sense based on the anti-materialism of the Bible and the fact that God basically just played a prank on Job and FORCED him to question God and then again forced him to accept God. It was all just some weird game? Or something?</TEXT>

The fruit gave them the ability to know the difference between good and bad which means that before they did it they didn #8217;t know eating it was bad. These people were brand spanking new, basically little kids, and sky daddy threw them out of the house after their first naughty. Satan literally just told them the truth and watched what happened.

They didn #8217;t know right from wrong anyway, so when the snake told them to do the opposite of what God said they would have no way of knowing that what they did was wrong until they ate the fruit.

    <TEXT>Having a unique name isn #8217;t the problem, having a strange or stupid name is the problem. My name is Morrison and I #8217;ve never met anyone else who #8217;s had that as a first name but the biggest response I #8217;ve ever gotten is comments like  #8220;huh interesting name. #8221; It #8217;s unique but it #8217;s still practical. Not trying to step on what you #8217;re saying but if OP #8217;s sister insists on a unique name it is doable as long as it #8217;s not a ridiculous name.</TEXT>

I think this proves my point. You can #8217;t just say the whole community is toxic. Yes, for sure, there are toxic individuals.

    <TEXT>Yeah no problem, here #8217;s a passage from [this Wikipedia article](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cisgender) German sexologist Volkmar Sigusch used the neologism cissexual (zissexuell in German) in a peer-reviewed publication. In his 1998 essay "The Neosexual Revolution", he cites his two-part 1991 article "Die Transsexuellen und unser nosomorpher Blick" ("Transsexuals and our nosomorphic view") as the origin of the term.[3] Cisgender has its origin in the Latin-derived prefix cis-, meaning "on this side of", which is the opposite of trans-, meaning "across from" or "on the other side of". This usage can be seen in the cis #8211;trans distinction in chemistry, the cis #8211;trans or complementation test in genetics, in Ciscaucasia (from the Russian perspective), in the ancient Roman term Cisalpine Gaul (i.e., "Gaul on this side of the Alps"), Ciskei and Transkei (separated by the Kei River), and more recently, Cisjordan, as distinguished from Transjordan. In the case of gender, cis- describes the alignment of gender identity with assigned sex.[4] Sociologists Kristen Schilt and Laurel Westbrook define cisgender as a label for "individuals who have a match between the gender they were assigned at birth, their bodies, and their personal identity".[1] A number of derivatives of the terms cisgender and cissexual include cis male for "male assigned male at birth", cis female for "female assigned female at birth", If you don #8217;t trust Wikipedia I #8217;ll drop some more sources on these people that elaborate on the above [Volkmar Sigusch #8217;s body of works (the originals are in German, it #8217;s a bit difficult to find his work in English but it #8217;s well-documented that he coined the now-outdated term  #8220;cissexual #8221;)](https://wikimili.com/en/Volkmar_Sigusch) [Kristen Schilt ](https://sociology.uchicago.edu/directory/kristen-schilt) [Article by Kristen Schilt and Laurel Westbrook](https://www.jstor.org/stable/43669855) Sigusch specialized in sexology and Schilt  amp; Westbrook are sociologists Edit: made some corrections based on new information from replies :)</TEXT>

Psychology isn #8217;t just the brain, it takes into account the entire nervous system and endocrine system.

    <TEXT>No, it #8217;s not a slur my friend. Slurs imply violence and oppression. The word  #8220;cis #8221; is basically the same as the word  #8220;black #8221; as a description. We both know that there #8217;s a word that means the same thing as  #8220;black #8221; but with some very demeaning and violent implications. That doesn #8217;t mean the word  #8220;black #8221; as a description for someone is bad. If an lgbt person tries to insult you for being  #8220;cis, #8221; they are dumb. Just laugh at them and move on with your day. The vast majority of the LGBT community would laugh right along with you, myself included.

    <TEXT>Pansexuality/bisexuality can coexist together or separately and it has nothing to do with attraction to trans people. Trans people don #8217;t want to be fetishized and we don #8217;t want someone to date us out of pity or duty. Sure, it sucks when someone says they won #8217;t date you because you #8217;re trans, but as long as they still treat you like a person who has value then it #8217;s all good. Most trans people share this view, you can go to places like r/asktransgender to see that. If you want to, go ahead and ask if not dating trans people is transphobic. Most of the comments will say that it is fine as long as you still respect the trans person #8217;s identity</TEXT>

    <TEXT>No it doesn #8217;t. Literally every human being has talents and accomplishments. If consider myself talented at art, but I #8217;m no Michelangelo. Among other artists, I #8217;m pretty average, but most people aren #8217;t artists, and therefore ability in art is considered a talent. I often think my art is bad even though when I post online I get positive responses (I #8217;m not blowing up or anything but you get what I mean). That counts as an instance of imposter syndrome Accomplishments is also vague. Wiping your ass can technically be called an accomplishment. Here it seems to just mean significant things that the person got done. For Example:  #8220;I got that job I really wanted #8221; Imposter Syndrome:  #8220;the other applicants must have been underwhelming. I don #8217;t really deserve this job #8221; Another Example:  #8220;I scored a goal in that soccer game #8221; Imposter Syndrome:  #8220;I got lucky, the goalie must #8217;ve been distracted, I don #8217;t deserve the praise #8221; It just means that your natural response to achieving something is to berate or belittle your achievement</TEXT>

I am a trans man and as a kid I always yearned to turn into a boy. I often cried when I thought about having to go on in the body that I had, but now I am on my way towards fixing all of that, and I #8217;m getting much better :) You can do it too!</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Yeah me too, but I just mean that most rational Americans aren #8217;t mourning and haven #8217;t been for a while. I think at this point it #8217;s more about acknowledging how it changed the world and in that way impacted history. Every airport in the world does things differently than they used to because of 9/11. 9/11 and the days following it were the first since air transport became commonplace that there were zero commercial planes in the sky. That #8217;s a noteworthy thing that happened, I #8217;d say, but still not worth venerating. I think it #8217;s appropriate that the day is remembered because of how it was a wake up call for many that even in times of peace in the modern age, people who desire to destroy will always find a way to do so. That said, none of the US bombings were justified and America only created more tragedy. I think the people the US hurt in response to 9/11 deserve remembrance too. So many were just as innocent as the people in the twin towers.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I wasn #8217;t aware of the law you were referencing, but after 2 seconds of research I found what I think you were referencing in [this article](https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/factcheck/2020/09/03/fact-check-california-law-does-not-decriminalize-sex-minors/3456171001/). Summary:  #8220;Legislation eliminates an anti-LGBTQ inequality in sex offender registration requirements SB-145 changes the law to allow judges the same level of discretion over whether certain people must register as sex offenders for consensual anal and oral sex as they already have for consensual penile-vaginal sex. According to its Senate Floor Analysis, the legislation  #8216;exempts a person convicted of nonforcible sodomy with a minor, oral copulation with a minor, or sexual penetration with a minor, as specified, from having to automatically register as a sex offender. #8217; Though it removes the  #8216;automatic #8217; requirement,  #8216;a person convicted of one of those specified offenses may still be ordered to register in the discretion of the court. #8217; It's also applicable only if the adult was within 10 years of age of the minor at the time the offense, and the minor was at least 14 years old  #8211; provisions known in some states as Romeo and Juliet laws. Before SB-145, an 18-year-old male convicted of having oral or anal sex with a 17-year-old male would be required to register as a sex offender, while a 24-year-old male convicted of having penile-vaginal sex with a 15-year-old female would not be automatically required to register  #8211; it would be left up to the judge. #8221; -it is still illegal for legal adults to have sex with legal minors -gay/straight sex between a minor and an adult is now punished equally -whether the adult has to register as a sex offender immediately is entirely up to the judge This doesn #8217;t seem like a problem to me unless there are judges who abuse the power, but judges who abuse power are a separate problem that affects all laws and their enforcement</TEXT>

    <TEXT>No. Normalize means the same as standardize. It just means make it the default. The tweet doesn #8217;t say  #8220;men everywhere are suffering under the oppressive boot of society we must end this!!1!11 #8221; It literally just says make men know that they are valuable. It #8217;s a message that men need to hear. Men #8217;s mental health, men #8217;s suicide rates, men #8217;s homelessness rates, and other related statistics are far above women #8217;s. Women #8217;s rights are important, but there are many areas where men are behind women in society. For example, it is socially acceptable for women in most of the world to express negative emotions to loved ones and receive support. In the same societies, men expressing the exact same things would be told to  #8220;man up #8221; or otherwise invalidated, leading to the worsening of symptoms oftentimes. Real equality addresses sexism against both sexes. It #8217;s fucking stupid that I have to explain this to you. People have value.  #10145; #65039; Men are people.  #10145; #65039; Men have value.

    <TEXT>I #8217;m not throwing my opinion in the ring but I #8217;ll answer your questions because everything OP said is totally possible even though it #8217;s unlikely. 1) OP #8217;s MIL is abusive and their dad dismissive, abusers don #8217;t ever care about the needs of the person they abuse and the enabler goes along with it 2) in some countries yes it is legal, and in the countries where it isn #8217;t OP would have to be able to afford a lawyer in order to do anything about it. Kids get thrown out on the street all the time for all kinds of reasons and can #8217;t really do anything about it except couch surf like OP or go into the adoption/foster care system 3) Bone marrow and every other organ or tissue you can donate don #8217;t have to have a blood relative #8217;s ties, but a relative is far more likely to have compatible organs/tissues than a stranger or non-relative. Strangers don #8217;t typically donate and the waitlist is long so oftentimes people in need of transplants will go to everyone in their lives to find a willing compatible donor. The MIL sounds shitty and probably isn #8217;t close with blood relatives, but even blood relatives aren #8217;t guaranteed to be compatible</TEXT>

I #8217;m being realistic about a country with an overinflated ego. Criticism of America is important and needed. Just because other people have it worse doesn #8217;t mean that I and my fellow Americans aren #8217;t allowed to expect better.

    <TEXT>Actually reading the manga wouldn #8217;t help here either. Japanese pronouns don #8217;t translate well at all into English. There are a bunch more of them than English and many are universal pronouns that have nothing to do with one #8217;s gender. There are almost none that are gender-specific and the ones that are tend to be really formal. It #8217;s easily possible for Japanese characters to be entirely androgynous in the way that they talk about themselves as well as the way other people talk about them. That #8217;s part of the reason why gender bending is really common in manga and anime. The language lends itself to the use of androgynous characters and the mystery often makes characters more interesting for the reader/watcher. This is the case with Envy.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I think maybe that it #8217;s not like the movies. No matter what we #8217;re talking about mental-health wise, it #8217;s not like the movies. You don #8217;t have to  #8220;be brave. #8221; Sometimes when you #8217;re told to  #8220;take a breath #8221; it feels like there #8217;s no air left in the world. You #8217;re entitled to your feelings, trying to avoid them just snowballs them down into your future mental health. I tried to suppress what I was feeling when my mom died and I ended up developing a panic attack disorder because I went entirely numb emotionally and any little change in my physical body became all-encompassing. I just remember thinking that none of what I went through was like the movies. It wasn #8217;t pretty or noble.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Hey, dude, I fee for you, really I do, but we #8217;re all just teens here like you. This subreddit can be toxic at times and I don #8217;t want you to risk getting worse mentally due to a jackass messing with you. Respectfully, you need therapy to help you get through what you #8217;re going through. My mom died of cancer a few years ago right after my aunt died while I had a broken leg and shit was fucking awful but I #8217;m still here, it #8217;s doable. It feels like the world has ended but you need to rally around the people who you value. They need you and you need them. Stay around for one another. If you need to talk you can DM me but I really urge you to look for therapy if you can</TEXT>
