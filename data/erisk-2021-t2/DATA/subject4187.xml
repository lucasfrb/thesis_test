    <TEXT>Actually, they did have a way to at least suggest causation. They interviewed the adolescents two times, one year apart. So they could see how much violence your friend caused at time one and see if it affected your violent acts at time two.</TEXT>

In this preliminary study, the researchers weren't able to identify exactly what was showing up in the brain scans -- except that the scans looked different for PSAs that were effective. Upcoming research will look at what's happening.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>The study will appear this week in Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences. Here is the abstract:  #8203; The transition from a human diet based exclusively on wild plants and animals to one involving dependence on domesticated plants and animals beginning ten to eleven thousand years ago in Southwest Asia set into motion a series of profound health, lifestyle, social, and economic changes affecting human populations throughout most of the world. Yet, the social, cultural, behavioral, and other factors surrounding health and lifestyle changes in the context of the foraging-to-farming transition are vague owing to an incomplete or poorly understood contextual archaeological record of living conditions. Bioarchaeological investigation of the extraordinary record of human remains and their context from  #199;atalh #246;y #252;k (7100 #8211;5950 cal BCE), a massive Neolithic archaeological site in south-central Anatolia (Turkey), provides important perspectives on health outcomes, behavioral adaptations, interpersonal conflict, and community resilience over the life of this single early farming settlement having the attributes of a proto-city. Study of  #199;atalh #246;y #252;k human biology reveals increasing costs to members of the settlement, including elevated exposure to disease and labor demands in response to community dependence on and production of domesticated plant carbohydrates, growing population size and density fueled by elevated fertility, and increasing stresses due to heightened workload and greater mobility required for caprine herding and other resource-acquisition activities over the nearly 12 centuries of settlement occupation. These changes in life conditions foreshadow developments that would take place worldwide over the millennia following the abandonment of  #199;atalh #246;y #252;k, including health challenges, adaptive patterns, and emerging social behaviors involving interpersonal violence.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Here's a key passage from the Discussion: The profile of findings makes two novel contributions to this body of literature. First, positivity in memory was observed even for regrettable recent actions. Second, temporal distance from regrets mediated the relationship between age and negative affect associated with major life regrets, suggesting that the discomfort of regret may subside over time. The latter is consistent with the understanding of autobiographical memory as a motivated and revisionist process.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Here is the full abstract: The accuracy of emergency management alerts about dangerous threats to public safety is key for the protection of life and property. When alerts of imminent threats are believed to be real, uncontrollable, and impossible to escape, people who receive them often experience fear and anxiety, especially as they await the threat #8217;s arrival (i.e., incubation of threat). However, what are the consequences when an alert turns out to be a false alarm? We explored psychological reactions (i.e., anxiety) to the 2018 Hawaii false ballistic missile alert using Twitter data from users across the state (1.2 million tweets, 14,830 users) 6 weeks before and 18 days after the event. We demonstrated that anxiety expressed on Twitter increased 4.6% on the day of the false alert and anxiety during the 38-min alert period increased 3.4% every 15 min. In addition, users who expressed either low, medium, or high prealert anxiety exhibited differential anxiety responses postalert, differential stabilization intervals (when anxiety stopped decreasing after the all-clear), and different postalert baselines relative to their prealert levels. Low prealert anxiety users expressed more anxiety at the onset of the alert and for longer relative to other groups. Moreover, anxiety remained elevated for at least 7 days postalert. Taken together, findings suggest that false alarms of inescapable and dangerous threats are anxiety-provoking and that this anxiety can persist for many people after the threat is dispelled. We offer several recommendations for how emergency management agencies should best communicate with the public after false alerts are transmitted.

This suggests that gun accessibility holds potential for understanding and preventing gun violence. Although criminogenic factors such as antisocial peer influence and substance dependence were, as expected, associated with gun violence, in multivariate models TCO symptoms also emerged as a significant independent risk factor for gun violence. Findings have important implications for improving public safety and management of community risk for gun violence.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Here's the full abstract: Extant political #8211;psychological research has identified stable, context-independent differences between conservatives and liberals in a wide range of preferences and psychological processes. One consistent finding is that conservatives show higher disgust sensitivity than liberals. This finding, however, is predominantly based on assessments of disgust to specific elicitors, which confound individuals #8217; sensitivity and propensity to the experience of disgust with the extent to which they find specific elicitors disgusting. Across five studies, we vary specific elicitors of disgust, showing that the relations between political orientation and disgust sensitivity depend on the specific set of elicitors used. We also show that disgust sensitivity is not associated with political orientation when measured with an elicitor-unspecific scale. Taken together, our findings suggest that the differences between conservatives and liberals in disgust sensitivity are context dependent rather than a stable personality difference. Broader theoretical implications are discussed.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Full abstract, from the journal American Psychologist: Automation is becoming ever more prevalent, with robot workers replacing many human employees. Many perspectives have examined the economic impact of a robot workforce, but here we consider its social impact: How will the rise of robot workers affect intergroup relations? Whereas some past research has suggested that more robots will lead to more intergroup prejudice, we suggest that robots could also reduce prejudice by highlighting commonalities between all humans. As robot workers become more salient, intergroup differences #8212;including racial and religious differences #8212;may seem less important, fostering a perception of common human identity (i.e., panhumanism). Six studies ( #931;*N* = 3,312) support this hypothesis. Anxiety about the rising robot workforce predicts less anxiety about human outgroups (Study 1), and priming the salience of a robot workforce reduces prejudice toward outgroups (Study 2), makes people more accepting of outgroup members as leaders and family members (Study 3), and increases wage equality across ingroup and outgroup members in an economic simulation (Study 4). This effect is mediated by panhumanism (Studies 5 #8211;6), suggesting that the perception of a common human ingroup explains why robot salience reduces prejudice. We discuss why automation may sometimes exacerbate intergroup tensions and other times reduce them.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Full abstract in Journal of Personality and Social Psychology: How do protest actions impact public support for social movements? Here we test the claim that extreme protest actions #8212;protest behaviors perceived to be harmful to others, highly disruptive, or both #8212;typically reduce support for social movements. Across 6 experiments, including 3 that were preregistered, participants indicated less support for social movements that used more extreme protest actions. This result obtained across a variety of movements (e.g., animal rights, anti-Trump, anti-abortion) and extreme protest actions (e.g., blocking highways, vandalizing property). Further, in 5 of 6 studies, negative reactions to extreme protest actions also led participants to support the movement #8217;s central cause less, and these effects were largely independent of individuals #8217; prior ideology or views on the issue. In all studies we found effects were driven by diminished social identification with the movement. In Studies 4 #8211;6, serial mediation analyses detailed a more in-depth model: observers viewed extreme protest actions to be immoral, reducing observers #8217; emotional connection to the movement and, in turn, reducing identification with and support for the movement. Taken together with prior research showing that extreme protest actions can be effective for applying pressure to institutions and raising awareness of movements, these findings suggest an activist #8217;s dilemma, in which the same protest actions that may offer certain benefits are also likely to undermine popular support for social movements.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>From the Journal of Experimental Psychology: General. The full abstract: We tested how cynicism emerges and what maintains it. Cynicism is the tendency to believe that people are morally bankrupt and behave treacherously to maximize self-interest. Drawing on literatures on norms of respectful treatment, we proposed that being the target of disrespect gives rise to cynical views, which predisposes people to further disrespect. The end result is a vicious cycle: cynicism and disrespect fuel one another. Study 1 #8217;s nationally representative survey showed that disrespect and cynicism are positively related to each other in 28 of 29 countries studied, and that cynicism #8217;s associations with disrespect were independent of (and stronger than) associations with lacking social support. Study 2 used a nationally representative longitudinal dataset, spanning 4 years. In line with the vicious cycle hypothesis, feeling disrespected and holding cynical views gave rise to each other over time. Five preregistered experiments (including 2 in the online supplemental materials) provided causal evidence. Study 3 showed that bringing to mind previous experiences of being disrespected heightened cynical beliefs subsequently. Studies 4 and 5 showed that to the extent that people endorsed cynical beliefs, others were inclined to treat them disrespectfully. Study 6 #8217;s weeklong daily diary study replicated the vicious cycle pattern. Everyday experiences of disrespect elevated cynical beliefs and vice versa. Moreover, cynical individuals tended to treat others with disrespect, which in turn predicted more disrespectful treatment by others. In short, experiencing disrespect gives rise to cynicism and cynicism elicits disrespect from others, thereby reinforcing the worldview that caused these negative reactions in the first place.

Decision-makers, then, may experience regret about these decisions. Past research distinguishes *affective regret*, negative feelings about a decision, from *cognitive regret*, thoughts about how a decision might have gone differently. Classic dual-process models of moral judgment suggest that affective processing drives characteristically deontological decisions to reject outcome-maximizing harm, whereas cognitive deliberation drives characteristically utilitarian decisions to endorse outcome-maximizing harm. Consistent with this model, we found that people who made or imagined making sacrificial utilitarian judgments reliably expressed relatively more affective regret and sometimes expressed relatively less cognitive regret than those who made or imagined making deontological dilemma judgments. In other words, people who endorsed causing harm to save lives generally felt more distressed about their decision, yet less inclined to change it, than people who rejected outcome-maximizing harm.</TEXT>

Full abstract: In the United States, God is commonly conceptualized as the omnipotent and omniscient entity that created the universe, and as a White man. We questioned whether the extent to which God is conceptualized as a White man predicts the extent to which White men are perceived as particularly fit for leadership. We found support for this across 7 studies. In Study 1, we created 2 measures to examine the extent to which U.S. Christians conceptualized God as a White man, and in Study 2 we found that, controlling for multiple covariates (e.g., racist and sexist attitudes, religiosity, political attitudes), responses on these measures predicted perceiving White male job candidates as particularly fit for leadership, among both Black and White, male and female, Christians. In Study 3, we found that U.S. Christian children, both White and racial minority, conceptualized God as more White than Black (and more male than female), which predicted perceiving White people as particularly boss-like. We next found evidence to suggest that this phenomenon is rooted in broader intuitions that extend beyond Christianity. That is, in a novel context with novel groups and a novel god, U.S. Christian adults (Studies 4 and 6), atheist adults (Study 5), and agnostic preschoolers (Study 7), used a god #8217;s identity to infer which groups were best fit for leadership. Collectively, our data reveal a clear and consistent pattern: Attributing a social identity to God predicts perceiving individuals who share that identity as more fit for leadership.</TEXT>

We tested this hypothesis in a randomized controlled study in a sample of 160 healthy older participants (aged 65 #8211;75 years) who were randomized to 11 weeks of either language learning or relaxation training. Participants in the language learning condition obtained some basic knowledge in the new language (Italian), but between-groups differences in improvements on latent factors of verbal intelligence, spatial intelligence, working memory, item memory, or associative memory were negligible. We argue that this is not due to either poor measurement, low course intensity, or low statistical power, but that basic studies in foreign languages in older age are likely to have no or trivially small effects on cognitive abilities. We place this in the context of the cognitive training and engagement literature and conclude that while foreign language learning may expand the behavioral repertoire, it does little to improve cognitive processing abilities.</TEXT>

[https://psycnet.apa.org/record/2020-09224-001](https://psycnet.apa.org/record/2020-09224-001) Full abstract: Religious people live longer than nonreligious people, according to a staple of social science research. Yet, are those longevity benefits an inherent feature of religiosity? To find out, we coded gravestone inscriptions and imagery to assess the religiosity and longevity of 6,400 deceased people from religious and nonreligious U.S. counties. We show that in religious cultural contexts, religious people lived 2.2 years longer than did nonreligious people. In nonreligious cultural contexts, however, religiosity conferred no such longevity benefits. Evidently, a longer life is not an inherent feature of religiosity. Instead, religious people only live longer in religious cultural contexts where religiosity is valued. Our study answers a fundamental question on the nature of religiosity and showcases the scientific potential of gravestone analyses.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>From the journal Social Psychological and Personality Science. Full abstract: Heroic acts are prosocial actions that involve extreme sacrifice and risk. Such acts receive near-ubiquitous praise. However, the present article suggests that one group refrains from praising heroic acts #8212;heroes themselves. Using self-reflections provided in news reports, Experiment 1 finds that people who actually saved others #8217; lives do not view themselves as positively as they should according to outside observers. Experiment 2 measures participants #8217; recollections of their own extreme prosocial acts and finds that self-evaluations are less positive than observers #8217; evaluations. Experiment 3 finds that participants who imagine themselves performing a heroic act evaluate it less positively than participants who observe the same act. Experiments 2 #8211;3 identify differences in perceptions of personal burden as a mechanism #8212;whereas observers believe that acting heroically involves extreme personal burden, actors view their personal burden as relatively unimportant. Being a hero is a distinctly less positive experience than observing one.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>From the Journal of Health Psychology. Full abstract: Parental hesitancy to vaccinate their children derails the success of mass vaccination campaigns. We examined the effect of parents #8217; personification of the vaccinating agency on vaccine hesitancy (i.e. negative or positive mind change) in 555 parents in a mass wild poliovirus vaccination campaign. Parents were assessed before and after the campaign on attitudes toward vaccination and the vaccinating agency ( #8220;The Israeli MoH is caring #8221; vs  #8220;hysteric #8221;). Positive mind change was predicted by a gender and malevolent personification. A negative mind change was predicted by parental anxiety. We conclude that parental hesitancy is influenced by parents #8217; attachment to the vaccinating agency.</TEXT>

[https://doi.org/10.1037/0003-066X.60.5.410](https://doi.org/10.1037/0003-066X.60.5.410)). Accordingly, mental health practitioners have promoted gratitude interventions as a means of self-help. However, results from previous reviews suggest that well-being improvements associated with gratitude interventions may be attributable to placebo effects (Davis et al. in J Couns Psychol 63:20 #8211;31, 2016. [https://doi.org/10.1037/cou0000107](https://doi.org/10.1037/cou0000107); Wood et al. in Clin Psychol Rev 30:890 #8211;905, 2010, [https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cpr.2010.03.005](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cpr.2010.03.005)). With this meta-analysis, we examined the efficacy of gratitude interventions (*k* #8201;= #8201;27, *N* #8201;= #8201;3675) in reducing symptoms of depression and anxiety at post-test and follow-up periods. Gratitude interventions had a small effect on symptoms of depression and anxiety at both post-test (*g* #8201;= #8201; #8722; #8201;0.29, *SE* #8201;= #8201;0.06, *p* #8201; lt; #8201;.01) and follow-up (*g* #8201;= #8201; #8722; #8201;0.23, *SE* #8201;= #8201;0.06, *p* #8201; lt; #8201;.01). Correcting for attenuation from unreliability did not change results. Moderation analyses indicated effect sizes were larger for studies using waitlist, rather than active, control conditions at post-test and follow-up. We did not find consistent evidence for effects of other moderator variables (e.g., risk of bias, depressive symptom severity, or type of intervention used). Our results suggest the effects of gratitude interventions on symptoms of depression and anxiety are relatively modest. Therefore, we recommend individuals seeking to reduce symptoms of depression and anxiety engage in interventions with stronger evidence of efficacy for these symptoms.</TEXT>

Results from this study suggest that reading is related to morality in various ways: Greater familiarity with fiction authors was positively correlated with integrity, perceived moral agency, and, via empathy, increased awareness of moral self. We also introduce a measure of young adult fiction exposure that has the potential to be of use in future research, especially given widespread popularity of young adult fiction in film and print.</TEXT>

However, little is known about how popular songs are related to the socioeconomic conditions. In this research, we analyzed the annual top 10 songs from United States and Germany between 1980 and 2017, and found that the unemployment rate predicted the amount of anger but not anxiety or sadness in lyrics in both countries. Our research contributes to the literature on popular media culture by revealing that top song lyrics may reflect public sentiment toward the socioeconomic environment. It highlights the possibility of using top song lyrics as an alternative measure of public sentiments.</TEXT>

But this claim is difficult to assess empirically because it is challenging to measure  #8220;social skills #8221; with confidence and because a strong test would employ nationally representative data of multiple cohorts. No scholarship currently meets these criteria. The authors fill that gap by comparing teachers #8217; and parents #8217; evaluations of children #8217;s social skills among children in the Early Childhood Longitudinal Study 1998 and 2010 cohorts. The authors find no evidence that teachers or parents rate children #8217;s face-to-face social skills as poorer among more recent cohorts, even when accounting for family characteristics, screen time use, and other factors. In addition, within cohorts, children with heavy exposure to screens exhibit similar social skills trajectories compared to children with little exposure to screens. There is a notable exception #8212;social skills are lower for children who access online gaming and social networking many times a day. Overall, however, the results represent a challenge to the dominant narrative that social skills are declining due to technological change.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Full conclusion on the article: In the present article, we develop and test a social cognitive framework for explaining why employees choose not to use all of their paid vacation days #8212;an important behavior for promoting and protecting health and well-being. We find empirical support for social cognitive factors that influence employees #8217; use of vacation days. Specifically, we find that if employees do not believe that they will actually detach from work on vacation, do not expect positive outcomes for vacation (i.e., feeling relaxed), and expect negative outcomes for vacations (i.e., negative financial consequences), they will be less likely to go on vacation. Future research is needed to understand how these social cognitive factors can be changed to encourage employees to increase their use of paid vacation days and derive the associated benefits for health and well-being.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>From the journal: Public Significance Statement: The presence of a relationship between debt holdings and people #8217;s overall satisfaction with life depends on the type of debt held. Though mortgages tend to be largest, and credit card debt tends to have the highest interest rates, student loans have the most negative relationship to life satisfaction.

To address this gap in knowledge, the current study considered the consequences of school absenteeism between kindergarten and eighth grade for the behavioral, economic, and educational outcomes of young adults. Participants were drawn from the National Institute of Child Health and Human Development Study of Early Child Care and Youth Development (age 22 #8211;23; 54% female and 86% White, *n* #8201;= #8201;648). The findings indicated that individuals who were more regularly absent from school were not more frequently engaged in risky, deviant, or criminal behaviors in young adulthood. However, those who were more regularly absent described being less likely to be politically engaged, reported themselves as experiencing greater economic difficulties, with less optimal educational outcomes, and as marginally more likely to have a child. The outcomes of absenteeism were largely cumulative and there was little evidence to suggest that the outcomes of absenteeism varied across urban and rural communities or as a function of socioeconomic status. Taken together, this study provides new insight into the long-term consequences of missing school and points to the importance of addressing absenteeism in the first ten years of students #8217; educational careers.</TEXT>

[https://psycnet.apa.org/record/2020-45471-001](https://psycnet.apa.org/record/2020-45471-001) Full abstract: The certainty with which people hold their attitudes is an important consideration because attitudes held with certainty better predict judgment and behavior than attitudes held with doubt. However, little is known about whether people #8217;s assessments of their certainty reflect a disposition to hold attitudes with confidence. Adapting methods used to document individual differences in people #8217;s attitudes, the present research demonstrates that the certainty with which people hold any given attitude is in part a reflection of a relatively stable disposition. Across 5 studies and 6 samples (total *N* = 106,050), we demonstrate dispositional variability in attitude certainty and show that it is related to but distinct from confidence in other judgmental domains. We also demonstrate that dispositional attitude certainty may be useful in predicting certainty in newly formed evaluations (Study 3) and an important consequence of certainty #8212;attitude-behavior correspondence (as indicated by reports of behavioral intentions and recent behavior; Study 4 and Student Sample in Study 5). Furthermore, we demonstrate that dispositional attitude certainty is relatively stable over time (Study 5). Results are discussed with respect to potential mechanisms and boundary conditions relating to dispositional attitude certainty, the implications of these individual differences for attitudes and persuasion, as well as the potential origins of dispositional attitude certainty.

    <TEXT>From The Economic Journal: [https://academic.oup.com/ej/advance-article-abstract/doi/10.1093/ej/ueaa111/5902443?redirectedFrom=fulltext](https://academic.oup.com/ej/advance-article-abstract/doi/10.1093/ej/ueaa111/5902443?redirectedFrom=fulltext) Full abstract: Using a newly assembled dataset of U.S. patents, we show that innovation activity is less concentrated in high-density locations than commonly believed. Yet, inventions based on atypical combinations of knowledge are indeed more prevalent in high-density urban centres. To interpret this relation, we propose that informal interactions in densely populated areas help knowledge flows between distant fields, but are less relevant for flows between close fields. We build a model of innovation in a spatial economy that endogenously generates the pattern observed in the data: specialized clusters emerge in low-density areas, whereas high-density locations diversify and produce unconventional ideas.</TEXT>
