    <TEXT>Been there, it's crazy. On a totally unrelated sidenote: at a festival me and my friend (on a school trip) met a few girls about our age. We talked to them for some minutes until one of them silently pointed to my friend(who had a girlfriend) and said:"you can fuck him" at a different point I had my pocket knife out, which is legal where I come from but not in the UK and same two people interact:"you can't fuck him tho" this time I didn't notice but they started to hit on my bro, so I started being awkward to get them away from him. Thinking about it, there are probably a bunch of girls who thought I was just being extremely weird out of saltyness TL:Dr defended my bro's relationship and seemed made a fool of myself doing it</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I adopted a loos dog that "lived" on a farm a few years back, she was a mutt (bordercollie and something small) and nobody wanted her so the owner gave her to the farmer who already had a Sheppard dog so she just kinda ran loose. The dog and cats of the farm ate her food and she eventually lived off of the tourists and their compost in the neer vacation house. When we went there she was underweight riddled with fleas and came early every morning even in heavy rain waiting for me and my brother to play. My parents went to the farmer and had a pre planned sum they were ready to pay for her. The farmer who probably wanted to put her down just gave the dog to us and now that little doggo is the family's princess and the only problems with her are barking at fellow dogs and laying in the way of my family to get attention</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I personally am okay with German WWII kits as long as they're not like ss or have svastikas on them because I am afraid it might encourage nazis to live their ideology in our sport. If for reenacting OK and Wehrmacht is OK anyways but as a German myself I would never wear one of those kits because I might get in serious trouble. Yours is cool tho and looks good.</TEXT>

Also the outer barrel tilts when screwed back on. So I can basically just have fun with it and try things before I get a good gun. Starting pistols with an asg mk23 as soon as it ships and a cheap gas 1911 nbb which will both receive a carbine kit in an individual style</TEXT>

And you're ignoring the fact, that ignoring overpopulation and not killing a certain Small amount of animals can lead to the extinction of other species. I'm not saying eating meat is good, but it's not that simple if you look at it from a greater perspective.

Yes people don't like getting called out and then they do something out of principle.

    <TEXT>You're only making half sense to me, I see that animals are being mistreated because of my actions so does the mean you've accomplished your mission? Being a vegan(/plant based *eater*) is in my opinion partially about food because only then you can stop having animals killed, if nobody profits off of it. So if you're an activist you should try to make people vegan *by* making them see their wrong ways and maybe even helping them become vegan.(my opinion not an argument of any kind) I understand that you can't exactly make someone a vegan but due to my limited vocabulary it's the best way I can say what I mean. If you only want to make "carnists" see what they do wrong you basically accept that some of them will keep eating meet because they don't care or something, right? I MEAN THESE QUESTIONS SERIOUSLY I'M TRYING TO UNDERSTAND You (I do not feel as though I'm any kind of victim in this situation)</TEXT>

(my budget won't be bigger until I graduate from school and get a job and I also would like to invest in an AEG primary soon so the 100 mark really is as far as I'll go for the pistol)</TEXT>

As far as a really short research showed the cheapest is around 150 and that would be more than I would like to pay for my first legit primary(currently a well ak74 plastic AEg because I have to be wait a few months to go to a field due to my age) The only viable tm would be the ebb pistol. I want to get the tm eventually but do you think the we tech would go around a year before breaking?
