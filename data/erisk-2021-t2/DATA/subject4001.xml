    <TEXT> gt;*But there's no actual evidence to support that conclusion*  gt;Cord cutting has only been accelerating and **breaking records throughout 2019.** And with a number of high profile streaming alternatives like Disney+ and Apple TV+ having launched this month, there's absolutely no indication that trend is going to change. That's something being made clear at research firms like UBS, which is actually predicting that things will be getting slightly better for AT amp;T, and marginally worse for cable giants like Charter: "UBS predicted that the U.S. pay TV industry will lose another 6.2 million video subscribers in 2020, down slightly from the 6.4 million the analyst firm predicts will be lost in total this year. If that loss comes to bear it will represent a 6.7% rate of decline, ahead of 6.2% in 2019 and well ahead of 1.2% in 2018 when video subscriber losses totaled 1.2 million.  #8220;We now expect industry losses to remain in the 6-7% per year range for the medium term, suggesting worsening trends in domestic core affiliate into next year, #8221; wrote UBS analyst John Hodulik in a research report. He said that improvement at AT amp;T will likely be offset by worsening trends for cable providers and other MVPDs."</TEXT>

Like DeVos, like Perry, and other government institutions like the EPA, FDA, Dept of Interior, State Dept. etc., etc. But Barr, unlike other Trump appointments, had to have credentials to do his job. He should be disbarred and removed for malpractice or whatever the legal community can do to unseat him at the DOJ. It seems to me there might be an avenue of recourse in this particular case.

    <TEXT>Indeed and let Mr. Market decide, eh? I'm gobsmacked by companies who refuse to acknowledge the giant cancerous wart on their noses but continue to profit wildly. Time for governments to do more than pay lip service.  gt;Most exposed is the fossil fuel sector which could lose one third of its current value, the report said. Fossil fuels account for around two thirds of global greenhouse gas emissions.  gt;Coal firms could lose as much as 44% in value, while the world #8217;s top oil and gas companies risk losing up to 31% of their current market share, according the report which forecasts oil demand peaking around 2027.  gt;The shift would nevertheless also lead to winners.</TEXT>

Currently the charges are of obstructing Congress. I don't think it means that other charges of obstruction can't be added at a later time. I would also add there could be a case for witness intimidation, that is just my layman opinion though. We'll see. There is a lot of legal maneuvering that must be considered as Schiff eluded to in his statement today. IANAL and I'm going to trust they know exactly what they are doing.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>The senate holds a 'trial'. The Chief Justice of The Supreme Court oversees this trial. At the end of the trial, conviction means the POTUS is removed from office, acquittal and the POTUS stays in office but is still impeached. In previous trials the Chief Justice have had a hands off approach while earlier ones were more active in the trial. A lot will depend on what Chief Justice Roberts does in this one.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>The GOP has systematically been working towards this ultimate end for decades. From ALEC, to unconstitutional gerrymandering and voter suppression, to Citizens United, to cite just a few examples. They have been extremely successful. In addition they have a propaganda network that has been extremely successful in brainwashing legions fomenting divisiveness and hate into their political agendas. I fear if the tide doesn't turn this next election cycle, it will take more than protests and voting campaigns to reclaim our Republic. I sincerely hope I am wrong.</TEXT>

Defunding social programs a step and then leaps at a time to then proclaim them ineffective and that private companies will be much better and more efficient. So be prepared when you are billed thousands for minor surgery or a few stitches. If you have a chronic condition, its a formula for bankruptcy in the US. Medical is the number one cause of bankruptcy for individuals in the US. The UK is in for a big shock in the individual pocketbook.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Good for you. We didn't either. It took sometime to train family to get used to this from us and honestly, we had to get harsh about it for the first few years. IDK why they wouldn't believe us that we *really, really* didn't want to participate either way. But now, it is much less stressful and they have finally accepted it. We're probably a grinch in their eyes but we don't care. There are no small children in the family except the adult ones, emotionally. We also buy ahead for routine stuff so that during November and December there are zero deliveries and extra trips elsewhere, just quick trips for fresh stuff from the grocery store. Also much less stressful.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Wow, I'm impressed, I've had issues working with that media so I mostly don't. If you don't mind me asking, how was the paper quality you worked with and did you have any issues with it? Recently I heard someone say 'whats is your hurry?' in regards to art/coloring. Adopting that attitude has made a big difference at least for me. As I'm sure it is for most folks, my time is limited for hobbies (sometimes highly) but I find I enjoy it more and the end product much improved by adopting that attitude. Also along those lines, experimenting with techniques etc. and taking time for that also has, admittedly very slowly, helped. Your work here clearly demonstrates that taking ones time pays off in major ways. My hat is off to you. Thanks for posting it!</TEXT>

Communication (or more accurately the lack thereof) is a big deal. Particularly damning is the lack of accurate information from official channels which can save lives. I do hope you and yours will recover and wish you all the best. For ordeals like this there are nonphysical traumas, financial hardships that last and are often difficult to overcome. I'm betting after this, bug out bags and plans will be on everyones list.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>In the 1960s people your age and younger were preparing for nuclear holocaust in the US. There were emergency drills where everyone including school children went home to shelter. There were drills in schools to 'duck and cover' under desks. During the cold war there were endless headlines and stories of how we were doomed to near extinction in a coming war with nuclear warhead exchange. It is all relative and it did spooky shit to people young and old then too. Climate change is vastly scarier than that, imo. But it isn't going to happen all at once, tomorrow. Learn what you can but keep it in perspective. It's okay to be frightened or angry or upset but try not to let that dominate your life. If you are motivated to do so, find ways you can contribute to lessen the impacts for yourself and what/who you care about. Your life is yours to shape which can be positive even if it seems small vs one filled with fear, anger, destruction or apathy. The more individuals (collectively and otherwise) do, the better the chances.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>The State Dept is an empty shell thanks to Trump. Trump has insulted long standing allies over his tenure. This action likely results massive destabilization in the Middle East while Russia, Iran perhaps NK and others find cause to support each other. There has been an unprecedented exodus in the pentagon of senior and seasoned officials, as well as the the State Dept. There are no adults in the room anymore, strap in.</TEXT>

Last year, 16 men on prolonged hunger strike were force-fed at the El Paso facility, according to the local chapter of Advocate Visitors with Immigrants in Detention (AVID).The latest round of strikes began in October, with five men refusing to eat by mid-November, including two men transferred from a privately run jail in Louisiana for forced medical treatment. ....  gt;ICE has set protocols for responding to a hunger strike and jail officials typically obtain a court order before force-feeding a prisoner. A number of medical and human rights groups consider force-feeding to be a form of torture.  gt; #8220;Force-feeding, especially when carried out by medical professionals, is ethically unacceptable, #8221; said Ranit Mishori, the senior medical adviser at Physicians for Human Rights, in a recent statement.  #8220;This practice is condemned by national and international medical organizations and experts and violates a detainee #8217;s right to refuse treatment and to use a hunger strike as a form of political dissent. #8221;</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Roe v. Wade is in real trouble now with multiple challenges headed to the Supreme Court from multiple states. Old white men in office (and some who aren't so old) are willfully ignorant of even basic human anatomy, let alone actual science, apparently believe women aren't sentient beings capable of making decisions for themselves about their own bodies. Worse, they won't even allow doctors to in some states. Religious zealotry is one helluva drug but it really is all about power over others. There is some batshit crazy stuff going on out there like this. *Ohio bill orders doctors to  #8216;reimplant ectopic pregnancy #8217; or face 'abortion murder' charges* https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2019/nov/29/ohio-extreme-abortion-bill-reimplant-ectopic-pregnancy The DOJ declared this week that the ERA is dead...get that.

    <TEXT>This is outrageous and you are spot on in saying this is '1984' shit. Propaganda is about vilifying your 'enemy' and making them appear less than human, an often used technique to justify wars and crimes against humanity. That episode was wonderful and a rare and intimate view into the lives of ordinary Iranian people I found exceptionally interesting. This is part of Bourdain's legacy and Hulu just shit on it. I want to know who made that executive decision and why because it is shameful and more than a little disturbing as it qualifies as political censorship. I'll just toss this one on the top of my list of why I'll never subscribe to Hulu.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Mass surveillance is expanding worldwide. Be it for economic reasons such as tracking purchases and following our every move online, to listening technology, physical tracking or the more troubling governmental invasion of privacy. Although I'm in the US, I see our rights, as well as yours and others being whittled away both in and out of sight. What is required is a digital bill of rights that respects individual privacy. I have little hope of any politician, anywhere, that could overcome the forces at play that use invasive technology for profit and for other and more sinister purposes such as gaming elections sans Cambridge Analytica or government surveillance in the name of anti-terrorism. I don't know how people can fight this.</TEXT>

They aren't playing around. They did this last year too but IRRC it was only TV spots. It is a small consolation that there is a pushback from Republicans, no matter how nascent and that 'the cult' hasn't swallowed up every last one of them.

The last bout was days of subzero temps at night and single digit highs (F) which isn't abnormal. A day after that it was 52 degrees F. (in a mountainous area) which is unheard of for January. Snow pack never really developed either. We have had shots of snow that then melt away. We're going through that again now. For at least the last 5 years it has been abnormal in the winter even to a casual observer. Considering the extreme weather in other parts of N.America and beyond, this isn't a complaint but observation and sadness about what is inevitable.</TEXT>

And the government #8217;s $30 million Complex Crises Fund was eliminated. ...  gt;In May 2018, Trump ordered the NSC #8217;s entire global health security unit shut down, calling for reassignment of Rear Adm. Timothy Ziemer and dissolution of his team inside the agency. The month before, then-White House National Security Advisor John Bolton pressured Ziemer #8217;s DHS counterpart, Tom Bossert, to resign along with his team. Neither the NSC nor DHS epidemic teams have been replaced. The global health section of the CDC was so drastically cut in 2018 that much of its staff was laid off and the number of countries it was working in was reduced from 49 to merely 10. Meanwhile, throughout 2018, the U.S. Agency for International Development and its director, Mark Green, came repeatedly under fire from both the White House and Secretary of State Mike Pompeo. And though Congress has so far managed to block Trump administration plans to cut the U.S. Public Health Service Commissioned Corps by 40 percent, the disease-fighting cadres have steadily eroded as retiring officers go unreplaced.</TEXT>

Trump shits on everything and everyone that has any dignity, any honor, any actual heroes and most particularly heroines, anyone with love of this nation and its diversity of people that supplants attention of him. He isn't capable of shame, he isn't capable of discrete thought, he isn't capable...full stop. Today, money and banality will talk and he will remain in office despite endless demonstrations of the depths of his inadequacies to serve as president, let alone actual criminal activities and the plethora of hard evidence that supports it. Fatigue has set in, disgust and dismay slap me daily. Voting will be cathartic in the upcoming election. My sincere wish is that no matter how much cheating is done, no matter the tsunami of lies told, there will be a massive turnout and powerful rebuke of this Administration that starts the process of healing deep wounds nationally and internationally.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I can't argue your points but I take a longer view. Regan was the watershed moment. The GOP has a long standing record since of lowering the bar politically using political operatives like Roger Stone and more recently organizations like Cambridge Analytica. They have committed economic sabotage in the dark of night in the back halls to favor their donors allowing regulatory capture and ensuring their positions after office in lucrative lobbying positions. They have vilified the weak and sick while glorifying predators. I could go on but it would take the entire bandwidth of the internet to do so. To be sure Trump is the culmination of a long-standing sickness that neoliberals can be faulted for as they prescribed embracing monied interests as a moderation rather than fight the disease of class warfare by GOP. If Bernie gets screwed again, I probably won't be alone in thinking the republic is lost and we'll go the way of an overt oligarchy or worse.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>You've hit upon a very large problem, it is with the media itself and particularly the 24/7 news channels and talk radio. Print media is now in the mix with online presences that vie for subscriptions and hits. I don't watch any of the 24/7 news channels so I can't address the representation of democrats discussing matters. What I do know is the nature of journalism and media changed for the worse when the *Fairness Doctrine* was eliminated by the Regan Administration. This is a long and storied history and worth a read for the uninitiated. There have been recent attempts by Democrats to revive it outlined in the Wiki page. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FCC_fairness_doctrine The civility of political discourse took an immediate hit giving rise to the likes of Rush Limbaugh who serves as a perfect example of a hate filled shock jock that regularly spewed conspiracy theories and lies over the radio. An important note that shouldn't be overlooked in the original doctrine below. Imagine if Limbaugh had to do that.  gt;Two corollary rules of the doctrine, the personal attack rule and the "political editorial" rule, remained in practice until 2000. The "personal attack" rule applied whenever a person (or small group) was subject to a personal attack during a broadcast. Stations had to notify such persons (or groups) within a week of the attack, send them transcripts of what was said and offer the opportunity to respond on-the-air. The "political editorial" rule applied when a station broadcast editorials endorsing or opposing candidates for public office, and stipulated that the unendorsed candidates be notified and allowed a reasonable opportunity to respond.[34]</TEXT>

In a Microbiology class we cultured under our nails and found it harbors all manner of bacteria. I've keep my nails short since as in they don't extend past my fingertips. We also cultured different areas in public bathrooms, if there were handles for water to turn and off, they are by far the most fertile ground for bacteria, followed by the door handle entering/exiting the bathroom and handles of the stalls even more than the toilet handle to flush.</TEXT>

The troublesome part are the increasing numbers of hardened bacteria and other mean nasties to antibiotics and disinfectants. Taking precautions isn't unwarranted or overreacting when there isn't an outbreak of flu. Other ways to protect yourself is to keep any open wounds, even paper cuts covered when in public spaces. Keep your hands away from your mouth, nose and eyes when in public spaces and until you can wash thoroughly. A lot of people will get dried out hands and that in and of itself can be a path when skin begins to breakdown and chap. So once you are home and are clean, moisturize your hands, do this before bed and after bathing. I am a former nurse and my hands really suffered.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I really understand because I feel this way too sometimes. All we can do is our best. I know what I/we do is like a drop in the ocean but if all of us do, then it more than one drop. For us, knowing we are doing what we can to not to do anymore harm is meaningful in itself. We also find solace in nature, no matter how small as increasingly it is a gift to be treasured. Although some might view it as simplistic, I for one find doing that and enjoying it to the fullest as much as possible helpful with the knowledge that even if we do not reverse things, we as a species die out, life otherwise will recover. Being informed is painful these days but it is our duty. Use that information to affect change when you vote, when you talk to others and like you are now, in your daily life. That is the positive. Being around those who think and act as you do is synergistic and positive as well. Sorry, I realize this isn't much but I hope it helps a little. All is not lost yet.</TEXT>

    <TEXT> gt; willfully, ignorant This is the part that is completely unforgivable. I'd go beyond that and say most aren't unaware at all but in order to keep getting monetary support from oil, gas, coal, big Pharma, etc. they have to. The propaganda that supports them is an industry in and of itself and necessary to perpetuate these bold and self-destructive lies to garner enough votes to stay in office with cheating making up the difference via gerrymandering, voter suppression, etc. in places where they would lose otherwise. So playing a fool (and in some/many cases they are quite simply, stupid fools) isn't too much to ask to keep the charade going. In the end its about money, old money and power to maintain that flow of money on both ends of that equation. I put it squarely on the heads of these politicians and particularly Republicans who have an interest in keeping people afraid of change, actively contributing to lowering education standards over decades, and lets not forget that pollutants in and of themselves like lead can cause learning disabilities at the very least. It's become a cult now and cultists rarely reverse their beliefs.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>This is only part of the story. The snippits below don't do the article justice, it is a worthy read as well. **Trump Has Sabotaged America #8217;s Coronavirus Response** ...  gt;In May 2018, Trump ordered the NSC #8217;s entire global health security unit shut down, calling for reassignment of Rear Adm. Timothy Ziemer and dissolution of his team inside the agency. The month before, then-White House National Security Advisor John Bolton pressured Ziemer #8217;s DHS counterpart, Tom Bossert, to resign along with his team. Neither the NSC nor DHS epidemic teams have been replaced. The global health section of the CDC was so drastically cut in 2018 that much of its staff was laid off and the number of countries it was working in was reduced from 49 to merely 10. Meanwhile, throughout 2018, the U.S. Agency for International Development and its director, Mark Green, came repeatedly under fire from both the White House and Secretary of State Mike Pompeo. And though Congress has so far managed to block Trump administration plans to cut the U.S. Public Health Service Commissioned Corps by 40 percent, the disease-fighting cadres have steadily eroded as retiring officers go unreplaced. ...  gt;Public health advocates have been ringing alarm bells to no avail.. Klain has been warning for two years that the United States was in grave danger should a pandemic emerge. In 2017 and 2018, the philanthropist billionaire Bill Gates met repeatedly with Bolton and his predecessor, H.R. McMaster, warning that ongoing cuts to the global health disease infrastructure would render the United States vulnerable to, as he put it, the  #8220;significant probability of a large and lethal modern-day pandemic occurring in our lifetimes. #8221; And an independent, bipartisan panel formed by the Center for Strategic and International Studies concluded that lack of preparedness was so acute in the Trump administration that the  #8220;United States must either pay now and gain protection and security or wait for the next epidemic and pay a much greater price in human and economic costs. #8221; ... https://foreignpolicy.com/2020/01/31/coronavirus-china-trump-united-states-public-health-emergency-response/</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Its happened already. The following snippits don't do the article justice, its a worthy read. **Trump Has Sabotaged America #8217;s Coronavirus Response** ... In May 2018, Trump ordered the NSC #8217;s entire global health security unit shut down, calling for reassignment of Rear Adm. Timothy Ziemer and dissolution of his team inside the agency. The month before, then-White House National Security Advisor John Bolton pressured Ziemer #8217;s DHS counterpart, Tom Bossert, to resign along with his team. Neither the NSC nor DHS epidemic teams have been replaced. The global health section of the CDC was so drastically cut in 2018 that much of its staff was laid off and the number of countries it was working in was reduced from 49 to merely 10. Meanwhile, throughout 2018, the U.S. Agency for International Development and its director, Mark Green, came repeatedly under fire from both the White House and Secretary of State Mike Pompeo. And though Congress has so far managed to block Trump administration plans to cut the U.S. Public Health Service Commissioned Corps by 40 percent, the disease-fighting cadres have steadily eroded as retiring officers go unreplaced. ... Public health advocates have been ringing alarm bells to no avail.. Klain has been warning for two years that the United States was in grave danger should a pandemic emerge. In 2017 and 2018, the philanthropist billionaire Bill Gates met repeatedly with Bolton and his predecessor, H.R. McMaster, warning that ongoing cuts to the global health disease infrastructure would render the United States vulnerable to, as he put it, the  #8220;significant probability of a large and lethal modern-day pandemic occurring in our lifetimes. #8221; And an independent, bipartisan panel formed by the Center for Strategic and International Studies concluded that lack of preparedness was so acute in the Trump administration that the  #8220;United States must either pay now and gain protection and security or wait for the next epidemic and pay a much greater price in human and economic costs. #8221; .... https://foreignpolicy.com/2020/01/31/coronavirus-china-trump-united-states-public-health-emergency-response/ edited formatting</TEXT>

They evaluated a $25 and $60 tax on each metric ton of carbon dioxide emitted by the U.S. energy system. Both scenarios would cut emissions greatly, largely by pushing up the price of fossil fuels, thereby encouraging industries and consumers to use cleaner energy sources and improve energy efficiency. Perhaps unexpectedly, the $25 tax would create more jobs than the $60 tax would.</TEXT>

March Madness and other large sporting events are scheduled this month. I have a family member who is in complete denial about this virus, will travel to these events and thinks every one is 'overreacting' despite my best efforts to provide evidence otherwise. Does anyone know if there is any indication that large sporting events are being considered as a risk? I also wonder about other large gatherings at this critical juncture in the US.

Follows what Trump alluded to at the recent town-hall and what he said last last month on CNBC:  #8220;At the right time, we will take a look at that. You know, that's [cutting entitlements] actually the easiest of all things, if you look #8221;. I think the federal federal government will do a significant payroll tax cut and then the current holder of the executive branch, if still in office, will use that later as partial justification to cut Social Security and Medicare benefits.</TEXT>

This family member is actively planning a trip in May to NYC for a 'break'. Confirmation bias that everything is fine is supported though a lot of varying sources that have a clear agenda. I don't know what else to do to convince them otherwise. His wife has asthma, mother is frail and quite elderly.

    <TEXT> gt;SA and Russia are also trying to compete against renewable as the price on renewable energy continues to come down and more projects come online. SA and Russia need to pump as much oil as they can because the economies of fossil fuels are going to start going against them as more alternative fuel sources become viable. This is an aspect that didn't occur to me. But pumping more oil now dramatically lowers its price at a time when demand destruction is high otherwise due to exceptionally slow global economy. I'm still confused as to how this benefits any of them except to kill Shale and other competitors for the future.</TEXT>

Im other nations, the military was used to clean areas while wearing protective gear that they already have, provide services to hard hit areas like delivering goods to individuals who are quarantined. These are the kinds of resources we should be thinking about and beginning to set in motion at least on an administrative level so should it become necessary, there aren't long delays.

I think rather than keeping the plans quiet it would relieve a lot of stress and worry by us plebs if we knew about at least the bones of them. Additionally, some things I realize require quite a lead time to gather resources, like building hospital facilities. I think the fear otherwise would draconian/authoritarian moves such as rounding up of people to put in 'camps'. A little transparency would go a long way to quell those fears. There is enough to be fearful about.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I agree. It is better than nothing but probably at the limits of what states can do. I'd welcome opinions to the contrary. I do think they instituted a 'fast track' but that wasn't clearly defined. Big business can't and won't fill in the gaps although some are making provisions. This is where fedgov needs to be on the ball, too bad that ball was flatted long ago. Now we are stuck with a deaf, dumb and blind Senate more interested in hard ball politics than the nations people who are in not only a health crisis but an economic one as well.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Big business will do the maximum amount of PR while their claims will in reality be filled with maximum limitations not immediately visible; either hidden in reams of legalese or simply exaggerated and poorly executed. This is why fedgov should be in the lead and mandating what they do as well as providing sustained relief. For those workers who lack adequate healthcare (see high-deductible or no insurance), workers who are part-time (and many have several part-time jobs), workers who have children to care for that are now out of school, the self-employed, etc. fedgov policy is the only remedy.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>UBI for the unemployed isn't a new idea. Finland and other nations have had successful runs. When people are given a stipend, they use it on practical things they couldn't afford otherwise, like dental care, books for their children. With what will be historic unemployment rates throughout the world, UBI makes more sense than one time payments issued by governments, particularly since the duration of unemployment can't be predicted during this unprecedented time. UBI isn't broad socialism, it is a pragmatic solution to a vexing issue that is likely to become synergistic in economies. Record numbers of people without work, without money to buy even essentials, pay rent, etc. and the economy suffers further.</TEXT>

Trump cannot empathize, he couldn't lead a one man band. He can't seem to find any respect for the health professionals that should be leading and informing Americans. Journalists can report about his briefings rather than carry them live although little substantive has come out of them. Trump is increasingly irrelevant in this crisis. He needs constant praise and proclamations about being superhero. Without his rallies, he is desperate for attention. Its time he's put on the back burner while everyone else deals with the most serious crisis the world and the US has faced this century.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>If you can provide actual evidence, not opinion pieces, that in fact taking a different course has a better outcome, then by all means, I'd be interested. Thus far from nations infected before us, the longer the wait before locking down, the worse the outcome. I've been following this since late January. Do you have recognized experts that can counter the guidance from the world class experts of the WHO and CDC? If so, lets hear it. Otherwise, We do know know this virus is much deadlier than the seasonal flu and much more contagious. Why now? We're behind, nations that instituted these measures and more *early* fared vastly better including returning to normal faster. Here is a graph from the CDC which illustrates it. It is a moving target unfortunately, the calculations are worsening because of our slow response. It will worsen even more if we abandon the proven methods to slow and control it. https://i.imgur.com/eGJ3ujS.jpg Do you really think other nations in lockdown before the US are doing this as an overreaction? In addition, those that get seriously ill are hospitalized for weeks, a subset of those are in ICU for weeks on ventilators. It will break the back of hospitals and those who work in them. In the US, unlike in China, younger population cohorts are increasingly included in the numbers of seriously ill and deaths. The world and this nation will recover, just like it did after world wars, the great depression, the 08 recession. Today, being informed and taking action will save countless lives. Today, our government and central bank are reacting in historic ways to ease the economic stresses, individual burdens and support economies for the duration, this is being repeated internationally. I do take issue with your tone as clearly you are uninformed about the nature of this crisis and pandemics in general. Do you know the difference between a seasonal flu outbreak , an epidemic and a pandemic? You resort to name calling of those who are following the advice of those who have worked the entire lives in the fields of epidemiology, virology, managing disease outbreaks, epidemics and pandemics. Calm down and look at what is actually happening in Italy, Spain, NYC and other nations and states in the US. This virus doesn't care what you think or anyone else. The virus is like physics or radiation, you can ignore it and face the consequences or you can respect the law of its nature, which is as hard and fast as gravity itself. I say, your attitude is the madness that will cost many lives that would survive otherwise and seriously sicken countless others. I for one refuse be the cause of a needless death. This is like a war, it isn't going to be easy for anyone. Our nation is more than its economy.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Florida said 'hold-my-beer' uh but oh wait. The hold outs won't budge until the death toll (see voter base) gets too high to ignore. Trump is a stereotypical coward in the face of war. The pandemic and its effects on the world and the nation is like fighting a war. He couldn't lead a one man band, he's never been answerable to anyone in his life.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>This series was entertaining but also relaxing. I enjoyed it so much. I have a hobby that has a small organization and really related to that aspect too. What I found fascinating is Crook is actually an amateur detectorist himself. We watched it when it was first offered. Then we watched most of Time Team (on a streaming service in the US) and then watched The Detectorists again which gave us a fresh and interesting perspective. Then we watched it again, months later and enjoyed it just as much the third time around as the first.</TEXT>

    <TEXT> gt;As recently as March 2020, Kushner was scheduling meetings alongside President Trump, Hope Hicks and campaign staff inside the White House on polling numbers. While the coronavirus crisis derailed the meeting before the presentation began, Kushner #8217;s inclusion in the meeting indicates he continues to overlap his official and campaign duties.  gt; #8220;OSC needs to investigate Kushner #8217;s behavior to ensure that he is complying with the Hatch Act, #8221; said Bookbinder.  #8220;There is no room in our government for top officials who deliberately violate ethics laws. #8221; The Hatch Act violations over time by the so-called President and his merry band of money-grabbing minions are countless now.
