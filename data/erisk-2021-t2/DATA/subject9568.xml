    <TEXT>Well, I'm not much religious either, but I guess free will just means that we can do the things that we want literally, angels don't have free will so they can't do things themselves and just follow the commands given to them. On the other hand humans "can choose" what they want to, but they'll also face consequences. Honestly, at times, I wish the afterlife shouldn't be a thing, because I'll probably spend some time in hell too, but then I think about all those bad people who'll get away with doing bad stuff. I'm kinda torn about it lol</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Yeah, I get your point. But what do you suggest we do with pedophiles then? Kill them? Torture them? Even if they actually didn't hurt anyone yet? I would agree that child molestors and rapists deserve all this, but why should someone get punished for having sick thoughts which they can't control? If they realise that they are wrong and ask for help, we should help them. Also, I'm not saying that pedophilia is ok, its a shitty disorder. But remember that the person that has it didn't really ask for it. Before downvoting just think about this for a min. What would you do if you had a son or daughter, who come out as a pedophile and want to kill themselves, would you allow it?</TEXT>

    <TEXT>It's a long story, but I'll try to summarise it. Basically the mods banned the word "trap" because they think its transphobic, whereas a lot of weebs dont think its transphobic cuz its used to refer to characters that crossdress in anime like femboys. And then the mods kinda became too authoritative so a lot of weebs left from r/Animemes and joined r/goodanimememes. Now this didn't just end, some toxic and mentally fucked weebs started doxxing and swatting the mods over this, like the police was involved. The subreddit is private now to prevent doxxing apparently.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I'm not talking about the ones that dislike it because of art and animation, that's a legitimate opinion. Neither the ones that don't want to associate themselves with weebs because the community around them is awful. (Well honestly, you can distance yourself from them) I'm talking bout those people who think anime is all pedo shit or sexual. It's like me thinking that all of Hollywood is just porn after watching some porno movies on IMDB. It's stupid. Genre filters exist. Just skip out on ecchi, and anything rated R+(Mild nudity), and watch more of Seinen. Seinen anime is targeted at young adult men. Like from late teens to 30s. An excellent example is *Monster.* (Although some of them are rated R+ and also include ecchi, you can skip out on that if you totally hate nudity) Some here find the voices cringy(Japanese), then you can just watch English dub(like me). But still, if you hate it so much that you don't want to give it a chance, it's okay there are better things to do in life. I'm willing to have civil discussions.</TEXT>

Don't shame people for something that they were born with, shame them for something they become or do. Think I'm sympathizing with pedos? You'll do the same if you had a child who comes out as a pedo. I wonder if you'll load out a gun and shoot him in the head just like that. Pedophilia is not a crime, being a child molester or a child rapist is, but ig this is too much for you to understand.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Sure, but read this last message of mine. There's a difference between me and you. Wanna know? I fucking hate drug addicts, smokers, alcoholics, stoners or whatever. These people ruin their lives and in most cases they ruin the lives of people around them. Imo doing drugs is the stupidest thing someone could do. But, I don't act like an asshole to them. I don't really wanna spend my energy on hating them online/irl because I already have lots of things that I like to spend my energy on. My life doesn't revolve around them. I have things to code, friends to talk and a loving family. I'm not an internet loser who wages some fictional war against people he hates, I have things to do in life, and don't spend more than 30mins-1hr on Reddit. I've done enough karmawhoring before because I was a loser who had nothing to do. Keep on wasting your time on hating degenerates, cuz that's the most you can do afterall :) Block me now.</TEXT>

Normal people with a life. But of course a person like you wont understand. Your'e the type of person that thinks that Muslims are terrorists, Indians are scammers, American students are school shooters and so on. You can't realise that majority of people are just normal. Who cares about the downvotes lmao? Bruh I don't even fap, you don't have any right to tell that to me if you fap while watching porn. Why don't you just block me lol?

    <TEXT>Yeah you're right, but you should know that there are countries where teenagers who lose their virginity are kinda outcasted or like idk the word from the society. All of my friends are virgins and it isn't considered something to be ashamed of. Most students focus on their grades and studies here. Thats why from my perspective I find y'all culture a bit weird and too demanding of teens with anxiety or the ones that find it hard to socialize. Like the only important thing in the world is getting laid...... I'm just glad I don't have to deal with pressure like that!</TEXT>

    <TEXT> gt; So that means that married couples should only have sex when they #8217;re trying to have a baby, and stop once they do. Nah I didn't mean that. Sorry I assumed that you meant sex is important for biological reasons. Couples can have sex whenever they want.  gt; It shouldn #8217;t, but unfortunately it is. Sexual desire is just human. We can try to force kids to suppress those desires, but it rarely works. Might be a difference in cultures though, like its a total different story here. Maybe if everyone around you is doing it you get compelled too or something like that.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>It breaks my heart to say this, but I'll tell it anyways. No, I'm not against it. It's not about it being morally disgusting or something like that, but in the end its just fiction. I found it a bit hypocritical when people thought loli hentai is dangerous but supported violent games. I'm okay if you think that both are almost equally dangerous(like playing violent video games would make you violent irl and watching loli hentai will make you a pedophile). But as we can see it's not the case right? There are no studies that show that fiction might influence you to do bad things irl. That's why I chose the first option in that poll, because I love violent games and know that playing them doesn't make me a murderer. So I didn't want to be hypocritical. I don't even watch loli hentai (if youre assuming that) CC best girl If the mods wish to ban me because I bring a bad name to this sub, then they can go ahead. I hope atleast some of you try to understand my point.</TEXT>

    <TITLE>Some questions about subliminals</TITLE>
    <DATE>2020-10-18 16:16:21</DATE>
    <TEXT>Hi, I've decided to make my own subliminals! It's not like the ones I was listening to weren't working, its just that I believe subliminals I make on my own would be more effective for me cuz I would be able to dictate what I want exactly, plus I wouldn't have to worry if the subliminal has negative affirmations or something. And I can't find subliminals about few topics. So here are some questions I have. I'm sorry if they are too stupid or dumb. 1) Should I also try creating blockage removers and boosters? 2) How does the brain understand affirmations at 2x/3x/4x? 3) Does the 48 hour challenge of listening only one subliminal at once really work? Would I have to listen to them again? 4) I'm thinking of adding piano music in the background because I really love it. But sometimes when I listen to subs with piano I imagine myself dancing, irrespective to the topic of the subliminal. Is that okay? 5) One of my subliminals is going to be about reaching some goal X. Should I write my affirmations about the goal itself? *I'm best at goal X* Or about the things that I'll need to reach that goal? Thank you</TEXT>
