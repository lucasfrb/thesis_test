    <TEXT>I'm on my personal laptop at the moment, I tried doing that but it just tells me I need drivers and I looked on the Netgear Website and Im not even sure where they are. But also cause my house's wiring is very bad the actual powerline product fails to work almost all the time which is why I'm wondering if I need to buy a Wi-Fi adapter. Im using the model XAV1OO4 The zero key is broken on this keyboard. Otherwise I'll have to run a twenty meter ethernet cable up two flights of stairs..</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Yeah, but I'm having a look everywhere and I'm not sure what it's called, are there any websites you can link me to where I can buy one? It's about a couple years old, house had a black out and stopped working one day, bought a different powerline and that worked for a month but then stopped. Pretty sure it's the wiring in my house. But much appreciated thank you.</TEXT>

    <DATE>2014-09-10 12:27:43</DATE>
    <TEXT>So I recently built my first PC, huzzah! It works great and all that but the problem is (and probably an easy fix I'm just an idiot) is that I use my 120gb SSD as my boot drive and everything I want to download tries to directly download it to that when I have a 2TB hard drive. I can't manually change the location where some things download and it's completely full causing major problems. Is there any way I can make my 2TB hard drive the go to default download section whenever I want something to be downloaded to it? Any help greatly appreciated!</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Hey there! I ahd the same issue with my newly built PC, I was only getting around 500kb/sec when my net could go up to 1.2mb/sec. This could be due to the signal that your modem/router is running on. Do you know if it's running on G or N internet? Because if it's different to what your computer can pick up, it will be significantly slower.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Nah it's fine, you can usually check on the bottom/back of your modem/router or on the box, if you know what model and make it is you can usually find it on the internet. If it's old, it probably is best to upgrade as newer laptops require N signals and will slow down due to the difference.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>The best advice I can give is do this: take out your PSU and GPU (CPU cooler as well if it's very extrusive) 1. Route all your cables to the back, unseen side of your case and secure bundles of wires using cable ties. 2. Plus everything in that doesn't require power (motherboard stuff) (sata) 3. Once you are happy with everything being routed behind your PC out of way you can then put your PSU and wire all the stuff that needs power into motherboard, still route it behind that back section and then make sure your GPU fits. 4. Everything should be neatly tied in the back section and you should only see the start and end of all cables plugged into stuff. 5. Congrats you win</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Studying bio as a year 12 hsc student at the moment, just some tips to make your class love you: 1. Use humour. I don't care how, when or why just do it, depending on what years you are teaching chances are a lot of the students don't want to do sciency-shit and it generally makes the classes go a lot quicker. 2. Interact on personal levels, talk about what they are talking about (gets much better when you teach older years). 3. Be fun in general, be interesting and don't make everyone just copy out notes. Please. Not telling you how to do your job, but trust me these help.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Exactly the same boat as you my friend, only a year older. I tried everything on the market - literally every antibiotic and topical cream you can think of and none of it worked. I am on roaccutane now (what we call it in Australia) and I am experiencing extremely dry skin and the best thing for it I find it just use cleanser every time before you go in the shower each day and it really helps. Use Vaseline or other greasy lip balm for your lips. I am suffering some of the worst acne I have ever seen (my dermatologist also said it's the most severe) and yes, I'm quite depressed about it, self-harmed and been to hell and back from the amount of bullying. Life goes on, you find stuff you keep you occupied and try to be around friends and family that don't ever bring it up and just try to have fun with you and not any insecurities about yourself. I'm just a PM away if you ever need to talk :) I'm sure my friends will read this</TEXT>

    <TEXT>This is really helpful, thank you, but I don't know if I can setup EyeFinity if its an AMD catalyst program (might not be, im not sure) as none of the catalyst programs function properly (another problem for another day.. :p) So I have one 1920x1080p Samsung Monitor on the left, it only takes DVI and VGA inputs. The monitor in the middle is an Asus one, again 1920x1080, it has HDMI, DVI and VGA but the HDMI can't go 1920x1080 for some reason in the resolution settings I really have no clue why so DVI seems to be the only one that can actually give a full HD signal. So what you are saying is that I need a HDMI-HDMI cord, with a DP adapter to give an 'active signal'? rather than just a two-ported cable? Sorry about the wall of text, I am just really annoyed I can't set up the 3rd display for what seems like no reason.. there is no signal coming from it whatsoever. I have displayed my PC on it once, but I had to unplug my Samgsung monitor for it to work and even when I try to do that again its still not working :(</TEXT>

All this futuristic stuff has just gone way too far, don't get me wrong, the whole idea is cool but I'm fairly sure that 98% of people really want a WW1/WW2 game with modern day game mechanics, something where you can see the grime and mud while being in trenches so that warfare can stop being fucking glorified for the horrific reality it is.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Yeah, I get you man. Don't feel like I'm trying to oppose your judgment, I think certain game developers need to stop putting their heads in the sand and listen for once. I know it's not meant to be real and it is really quite fun, I just think the history lovers (myself included) would love to be immersed in the reality of trench warfare during WW1, or the uprising of Stalin and the USSR post-WW2. Just my thoughts :) edit: why the downvotes?</TEXT>

    <TITLE>Can someone please explain the USD - AUD steam pricing?</TITLE>
    <DATE>2015-06-14 04:16:56</DATE>
    <TEXT>So I see that GTA V, for US people is like $59USD, okay sure makes sense, but on steam in Australia it says $75USD, which presumably is the currency exchange rate already completed, awesome. But when you actually go to pay for it you are paying somewhere around $90 AUD.. why does this happen? Why is the price marked up technically twice? This happens for all games across steam and there's no way (to my knowledge) to put it straight in AUD. Can someone please explain this? Cheers.</TEXT>

I have been told multiple times that ratings on a PSU are only relative to power consumption, and my friend really isn't worried about that; so would a simple bronze 550W PSU be okay?

    <TITLE>Brothers, my computer has been hacked today and I need help from anyone please!</TITLE>
    <DATE>2016-02-12 12:30:06</DATE>
    <TEXT>So, I helped my friend ascend today from a TV to 2 x BenQ monitors. Like every day, I just leave my computer on which has never been a problem. When I got back home I noticed a chrome window was open, my mouse was moving and was communicating to someone in a chat bar. I Instantly freaked out and closed the tabs and turned off my computer. I grabbed my laptop because I dreaded that purchases had been made, and sure enough saw [this.](http://imgur.com/Ac2uaGF) My heart sank, I instantly rang PayPal to try and sort this out and they basically told me if there's evidence then we'll give you your money back, and that I should call my bank. I called up Westpac (Aussie) and a really nice guy called Rob froze my online banking services and redirected me to the fraud squad. While explaining the situation the women on the other end cut me off saying that it's impossible to gain remote access to a computer without me clicking a 'pop-up', which obviously wasn't true. This lead to her telling me to stop wasting her time and hung up; great. So here I am, basically stuck without any knowledge on what to do at this point as there is no evidence that there was someone controlling my computer remotely. What I found interesting was that the $500 payment was sent to a twitch streamer, someone called Vinny Inevitable. I'm not sure if he did this but then again, I have no idea. His email from the PayPal payment is Vinny.inevitable@gmail.com Additionally, I did the CMD command 'netstat -an' and some foreign IP's came up [here](http://imgur.com/OBFP2ny) but it's difficult to know who did it.. If anyone could advise me on this situation I would be so grateful, my mum, dad, brother and myself and concerned for the safety of sensitive information..</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Hey guys, Me and my best friend are DJing a "Christmas in July" cruise and have been asked include a christmas party song every few songs or so. However, I have not been able to find many danceable (?) party Christmas tracks and have just got the classics which are quite slow. Can anyone recommend any boppy, fun christmas tunes? It would be a great help! Thank you all :)</TEXT>

    <TITLE>Rekordbox Performance Mode</TITLE>
    <DATE>2017-06-16 03:45:46</DATE>
    <TEXT>Switching from Cross DJ by Mixvibes to Rekordbox due to buying an XDJ-RX was a big move for me. I just want to get an understanding of how many people actually use Rekordbox Performance mode for controllers or HID mode, as I mainly just see people using Serato, which I would consider switching to. Cheers. Also noticed that i feel a lot more safe using the laptop with the RX as sometimes it straight up freezes completely and needs yo be rebooted, but the software keeps the music playing which has saved me on a number of occasions</TEXT>

    <TEXT>probably something to do with better stats for their page to get more reach (e.g. one video with 200,000 views vs if they have 2 videos that look like one each get 200,000 (400k total) views the facebook algorithm probably either gives them increased publicity/reach or increased ad revenue.)

    <TEXT>I love watching all the YouTubers play rust and i used to play it for a while, I stopped for a couple years to focus on study but want to get back into it. Every time I try and load into a server, it'll load everything (assets, mountains etc) but then crash right before joining with an assortment of messages: Bad_module_info OutOfMemoryException: Out of Memory Or just crash without any message. I have not changed my hardware since I played and it is: i5 4590 Radeon R9 280x 12gb ddr3 ram Has anyone had the same issues?? I am getting really frustrated and tried reinstalling, validating my files, looking everywhere on the web but can't find anything helpful.. Any help would be really appreciated</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Agreed, and I feel you man we've literally all been in the same shoes - not a single DJ I know has just gone to the decks and found it easy off the bat, it takes patience and knowing the equipment in and out. When I first started I found it hard to remember everything to do at once: bpm, beatmatching, song selection, EQs, volume, effects etc. You'll hear it a thousands times but practising is the best way to learn. Once you do it enough times it comes naturally, like learning to drive. Also watching people mix like on YouTube also helped me!</TEXT>

    <TITLE>Samsung user here.. thinking of switching to iPhone</TITLE>
    <DATE>2019-06-13 16:00:52</DATE>
    <TEXT>Basically title. I love my Samsung S9 and it's modularity and flexibility, fast charging and sd card etc. There's currently a phone plan in my country for an iPhone XR that's super tempting, and honestly I fucking hate how shit all my Snapchat and Instagram videos look and how clunky it can feel to use.. I am thinking of making the switch, has anyone done this and can give me some advice? Or just regular iPhone users haha Cheers EDIT: thanks all for the advice, I decided to jump in and grab an XR - the app that migrates data from Android to iOS doesn't work for me so I have to go into the apple store tomorrow :)) good first start hah</TEXT>

    <TITLE>What do you guys think? Calvados  amp; Cognac cocktail</TITLE>
    <DATE>2019-08-30 02:39:47</DATE>
    <TEXT>Howdy, I'm relatively inexperienced at mixing cocktails but the new bar I'm working at has assigned me to create a cognac and calvados drink - no limitations. I haven't had time to experiment but I was thinking on doing a take on the Sazerac variant - Pomme D'Amour: * Bspn Demerara sugar (maybe brown gomme?) * 2dsh Peychauds * 2dsh Apple Bitters * 30ml Rye Whiskey (Wild Turkey) * 30ml Apple Brandy (Calvados) Rocks glass, absinthe rinse, cubed ice, lemon peel, expressed, stirred. The variant I wanted to spin on this would be swapping out the Rye with Cognac, do you guys think this would work? Have you had any experience combining the two? (Cognac  amp; Calvados). Any tips would be greatly appreciated, thank you! Apologies if this is a silly question, I'm still learning :)</TEXT>

    <TEXT>In 2014 I build a gaming rig with an i5 4590  amp; R9 280x - was great up until late 2019 when I wanted to play modern warfare without it messing up. Upgraded to a 1070 for around $400 (AUD) and basically every game worked amazing but was being bottlenecked by my CPU so I bit the bullet to upgrade mobo, ram and CPU - am now running a Ryzen 5 3600  amp; 1070 Combo and basically get 60fps ultra on 1080p (except modern warfare bc its optimised by monkeys).</TEXT>

    <TITLE>GameStop give completely reasonable prices for trade-ins</TITLE>
    <DATE>2020-06-02 02:16:33</DATE>
    <TEXT>I see all the time how much GameStop and stores in Aus like EBGames rip off people for trade in credit but what a lot of people are forgetting is that it #8217;s the pawn shop fallacy. You #8217;re walking in there knowing you #8217;ll get *guaranteed* cash for your items, it may not be what the going market prices are for those items but you #8217;ll get money for them - no waiting for people to keep lowballing you it #8217;s GUARANTEED. Businesses still have to make money so of course they #8217;re going to mark up those prices and they might not even end up selling them. If you really want your money #8217;s worth then sell your stuff on Facebook marketplace, gumtree, Craigslist etc quit complaining that you #8217;re not getting the best deal from GameStop.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Second this. Most pioneer gear doesn't depreciate quickly - sold my DJM 700 for the same price I bought it for 6 years ago. OP - Have a look at DDJ SB / RB they're a great entry level controller, sell it if you don't end up enjoying it.</TEXT>
