    <TEXT>I was just wondering since I am seeing a lot about southern NH or central NH in the whites. I live in northern Co #246;s so I was just wondering if there was any posts relating to up here. Edit: I didn't realize Co #246;s made such a small dent in the population, I though it would've been more for the amount of space we take up. Kind of made me remember how isolated we are up here.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I agree with a lot of this except the terrain part, I have been up there where the expansion is supposed to take place, and I can tell you it is extremely steep. I am talking almost vertical, dodging trees by a sliver, really difficult terrain. Also the Balsams keeps snow longer than anywhere else in the east about. There is still tons of snow in Dixville Notch as I type this, and probably even more in the valley. Money is the problem for the Balsams though, it is a beautiful resort but it is in such a remote place and they need so much money it is a hard sell for a lot of potential investors.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>You are correct on the it is more of a hotel than a ski resort part. Currently it is a very small ski hill with about 15 trails if I remember right. The ski slope was just built as a little bit of extra revenue to keep the place open. The hotel is still extremely beautiful though. The ski expansion will have tons of snow (there is still tons of snow in there as I type this, and I know because I have seen it) and some extremely steep terrain. But Les Otten does worry me a lot about the future of the Balsams.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>In the presidential range and franconia notch there is a lot more advanced terrain, and the Balsams can only compete with that with the steepness. But the Balsams does have a high annual snowfall (somewhere in the 350 inch range) and it keeps the snow long after the surrounding area has lost it. I still find the Balsams to be a pretty absurd project and it isn't really sensible business wise. But it would be the best hotel and ski slope combo in the East by a long shot. Edit: The original Balsams isn't as steep as the presidential range or franconia, but the area they are expanding to does have steepness comparable to the presidential range and franconia. I have seen it snowmobiling up in Dixville Peak. Should've clarified earlier.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>As a local of the Balsams (well, next town over from me but still extremely close) I have always hoped it will open. The Balsams has been sitting since 2011. Surprisingly the resort has held up really good, no visable damage to the buildings other than the worker dorms (which were getting torn down anyway). Also they would have one of the biggest snow total for a ski resort in the East. They also have some pretty steep terrain. But they will never have the money. From a business point of view it is a horrible plan.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>That is kind of what I am thinking. Because I live 10 minutes away from there and it is a whole different world there than the surrounding area. There is still feet of snow in Dixville Notch in some spots but just 10 minutes away there is none. As of right now people may not be willing to drive the extra distance just for steep terrain and tons of powder. But in the future I feel like it might be the only good place in NH to ski.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Well, a lot of places don't even count Dixville Notch as a town, they just call it part of Colebrook. So a lot of websites say 100 inches. But all the locals say there is 350 a year in the valley, and I believe them. It can be raining in Colebrook and dumping snow in Dixville. I have hiked out into that valley and have had to turn back when I was chest deep and it got deeper. So the 350 inches is just a local rumour that nobody knows is true.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I can confirm, that is what the glades look like up there. Once I get better at skiing I am actually thinking about doing snowmobile laps from the trail on top of Dixville Peak just because the snow and the terrain is so good. If the powder is untouched it would be even deeper a lot of the time. But if they open I guarantee you that the glades will be all tracked up by other people.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Well first of all, if I screw up a shot the animal suffers for a max of 8 seconds I would say. If it wasn't for fisherman lakes would be overcrowded, and fish would die from starvation which is a pretty horrific death. I have seen moose die from starvation, it is pretty sad actually. It isn't a fast painless death, it is long and horrible.</TEXT>

I am doubtful predator animals could make that much of a dent in deer population. Also without deer hunting there could be a problem with overgrazing, which would screw up crops, and all that stuff.</TEXT>

Also if there were to many animals diseases could spread amongst humans much more easily. One more thing, a lot of communities and and states and even countries rely on hunting to control the population, and for the funds for conservation.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Have you ever been hunting? If you have you would know it is very humane. I got 50 pounds of meat out of the deer I got this year. It was killed painlessly and instantly. That is much better than a cow spending their whole life on a factory farm suffering. So 50 pounds of meat, a supported economy, more funds for conservation, and helping with overpopulation seems pretty good. In my opinion I would rather have 50 pounds of meat from a ethically killed animal (and that wasn't even a good kill) than 50 pounds of meat from a factory farm.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I am a local (kinda, few towns over) and I haven't seen really any work done or heard. They are desperately trying to get people to invest and noone really knows the success of that plan. They left the project involving tearing down the old workers dorm uncompleted. No work on the ski area at all either. The original ski area (the one pictured) is getting very over grown and needs the brush cut desperately. The whole project is just getting neglected. I personally don't think it will ever reopen. Thinking about taking a snowmobile up to the summit of dixville peak this winter and skiing down to the original ski area and getting some laps in though.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>The resort got shut down 10 years ago when it was just to expensive to run for such a little profit. They have amazing plans to make their old 8 trail (i think) ski area into the biggest in the east. I doubt it will ever happen, but you never know. You can see the plans on their website if you want.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Well the road leading to it is gated off. But you can legally make it to the summit by taking the Table Rock Trail in Dixville Notch and going off the Table Rock Trail onto the Mt. Gloriette Trail. Still go to Table Rocks lookout point though, amazing view of the hotel, notch, and all the foliage. Then you just go up Mt. Gloriette Trail and you are at the summit. I wouldn't recommend making the trip this year as we are in a drought up here and the foliage is pretty bad, plus we are nearing peak as snow is going to be flying in a month.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I agree, but it would be well worth it since from my house I can see that the original ski area still has snow in mid to late June. And the original ski area wasn't even built in the spot with the most snow. I am pretty sure with snowmaking and grooming the could potentially have skiing late June early July. Which would make it the longest season out of any resort on the east.</TEXT>
