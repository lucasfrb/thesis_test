    <TITLE>Side effects of porn</TITLE>
    <DATE>2020-08-14 10:13:42</DATE>
    <TEXT>I had been watching porn from past 2 yrs. I'm on nofap, so left watching it. I just want to share my experience n thoughts on porn in these 2 yrs. I'm a woman, 21 yr old. The first time I saw porn was wn I was in 8th std. It was shown by my cousin brother with an intention of having sex with me after showing it. In the video clip woman was doing oral sex for the man. It was first time I ever saw porn n trust me I found it soooo discusting, I felt like vomiting, bcz @ that point of time I didn't knew wt oral sex is. I felt a scence of shame, guilt n on top it my bro's intention to fuck me, hurt me sooo much. This reflects the mindset of a porn addict person. It reflects....no matter what, with whom, whether it hurts someone.....I want have sex n enjoy n satisfy my genitals. This is wt is there in the mindspace of that person. Anyway he couldn't do anything with me, I blackmailed him. Wt I want to say is porn ruins ur relationships, though it satisfies ur need of orgasmic pleasure. U start sexualizing everyone around u bcz of the obsession u have for sex. But porn also prevents rapes by satisfying u, so that u don't go hunting a woman bcz of ur inability to tolerate the hunger. U may have a Q like....then y did I start watching porn? Right? Well let me ans that Q first. I have a good self control n I was confident that I will not get addicted to it. I just wanted to masturbate n feel pleasure. That's the reason. Wnever I watched porn I always searched for good content like passionate sex, lovemaking, loverrs, couples, sensual n passionate sex, etc. So that I dont watch dirty content n spoil my mind. If I watch porn for 2 hrs, I ended up watching just 40-60 mins n rest of the time goes in search of good content. So I'm not saying porn is bad. The content of it may be wrong many times. I used to watch porn monthly once, twice... I enjoyed. Still I was normal n no effect on my relationships. But I used to sexualize ppl in my mind without any guilt. This was the side effect of it. Now let me throw some light on porn language n it's content. I'm sure u all will agree if I say that porn brings down the v essence of lovemaking. Let me tell u y n then u all will agree with me. Most of the videos in porn websites have content like.... teacher fucking student, neighbors have hardcore sex, sex with step mom, step dad, student, cousin, brother, sister, husband's colleague, husband's frnd, teenager, aunt, professor, boss, client etc including pregnant ladies n old ladies. I can go on n on. Porn uses abusive language like big tits, hot babe, sexy aunt, slut, bitch, fucking, pussy, teen with small tits, long dick, anal sex, big cock, fat pussy, etc. All these words or this kind of language wn we read, everything gets wired in our mind. It doesn't show the effects immediately. But all these words gets reflected in our mind in the long run wn we sexualize a person in our mind. We feel shame, guilt for objectifying in such way but can't stop those thoughts coming through. By that time we realize, it's already late bcz those words, images, thoughts, language, abusive actions r already deep rooted in our mind n we can do ntg Abt it. The most destructive effect of porn language, words, abusive actions, the relationship with the person whom they have sex with, etc......all these abusive content brings down the v meaning n essence of lovemaking. First let's understand wt lovemaking is. Lovemaking is the greatest thing the nature has ever created. It's the greatest form of showing love to ur beloved, experiencing ur beloved at greater deapth, feeling the loveable actions of ur beloved to understand him/her at deeper level, etc. It also reflects the passion for each other. Lovemaking also provides space for spiritual growth of both the individuals which is 1 of the ultimate goals of life. Now coming to porn.......it just demeans n destroys the v act of lovemaking. Lovemaking is btwn lovers, not btwn 2 individuals having a relationship other than soulmate. That's the reason it's called "LOVE-MAKING". So anyhow..... today is 8 th day of my nofap journey. The purpose of starting nofap is know myself at deeper level like peeling the layers of onion one by one n get connected with myself deep within. Also to find love of my life.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Mmmm. U r right. But I think porn may also prevent rapes in some cases....... Bcz the more hungry they r, not able to watch porn..... sometimes cannot control their urge n go hunting ( for the week persons), also in case if he thinks women r meant for pleasure.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>What do u do, when u r in love and that love will not go in the usual direction that we expect love to go?????? Meaning what do I do when I'm in love with a person who is not available, bcz of geographical reason, social reason, emotional reason, or whatever??? He seems non - responding and non-existing, even though he is there somewhere and I wonder whom is he born for??? I'm sooo much hungry, infact starving for his love. There's a deep LOVE VOID in me. How do I deal with it? It's been 2 yrs being in love with him, anonymously. The love him soo much that I just want to surrender myself to him, unconditionally, with absolutely no explanations. The intensity of belonging to him and the intensity of the feelings, ........I have no words to describe.</TEXT>
