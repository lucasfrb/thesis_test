    <TEXT>I like the intro, I think the water effect is nice but it sticks out a slight bit ? maybe eq it further on the low end ? I like the melody, the progressions great theres always interest going on. the drop works well too. on a less technical side i enjoy the track, its my type of vibe. i can tell you put work in ! keep it up and please keep making more and sharing ! the second drops great to btw, i like what you did with the piano there. my biggest take away is the strong arrangement, great sample choices and the melody is great.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I #8217;ve been producing for quite a while and made okay progress. right now i am a bit frustrated and uninspired(specifically with songwriting aspect) , i think the reason is i have no set workflow or method to getting things done. I decided fo relearn everything from scratch as i didn #8217;t really learn originally with any sort of goal oriented focus. What would you recommend someone who is looking to learn efficientlyC again i am more focussed on song writing and arrangements. Im also thinking of switching daws.. i have a legit copy of logic x and studio one 4. right now i use Maschine as my main daw, i dont think its helpful for arrangement though.

    <TEXT>I cant afford to lose the account, i already deactivated it before for ten weeks. I reopened it to see if its okay and it was, 7 days later i have deactivated it for ideally 6 months, im wondering if this is a bad move.. i haven #8217;t had any warnings before i dont spam or do anything naughty and i dont think i have ever been reported. Yes i know i could just delete the app itself but i dont want people thinking i am inactive and unfollowing me etc. Is it risky for the 6 months ? I was thinking doing intervals of 10 weeks but i dont wanna flag the servers and get in any risky situations. Also if i deactivated it using 4g would it Trigger anything if i reactivated it on another device or on wifi?</TEXT>

    <TEXT> #8203; Hey everyone, This is currently the Mac I have (Bought 2015) MacBook Pro (Retina, 13-inch, Early 2015) Processor 2.7 GHz Intel Core i5 Memory 8 GB 1867 MHz DDR3 Graphics Intel Iris Graphics 6100 1536 MB \--------------------- My Qualms with my Mac, \-- Storage is really bad (128GBSSD) \-- CPU/RAM - I don't know if its me or the DAW, but, I use Maschine and when I get to a certain point of my production I always get cracks and pops, I've tweaked the latency, cleaned space as much as I can, I have no programs running but my DAW and the internet switched off. I try not to add too many plug ins into single channels etc. I #8217;m impatient and would just like things to load as instantly as possible/run as smoothly as possible. \------------------- What I need is a System that has great storage, for my samples,projects,dj tunes is 512gb enough or 1tb should do it? In terms of processing power and RAM, what would you recommend? Whilst I don't want to spend unnecessary amounts, Im seeing this as an investment so don't mind shelling out as long as Im not paying for what I don't need. I am eyeing up the 16 inch Mac however I am happy with the 13inch or worst case scenario a Mac mini as long as everything runs almost instantaneously, and storage is good [View Poll](https://www.reddit.com/poll/ira8de)</TEXT>

    <TEXT>That's a good way to look at it, I think I wouldn't fill up my libraries that much but I could see as a producer that works the way you do a lot of storage would be important. I use splice so for the most part it will be cloud based for my samples.  #8203; I am considering a desktop for sure now, I also rent studio time occasionally so as long as they have monitors I could bring a Mac mini with me to continue working. When I do get a new system I would only have that so I would have to use my phone for browsing etc.  #8203; Thanks for the feedback, would like to listen to some of your music if you have a link?</TEXT>

Luckily I have an ultra wide Samsung however, the screen size on the 16 inch is fully welcome it just makes things work way better.  #8203; 1TB for sure is the goal for me.  #8203; In regards to the CPU, either option on the 16 inch should be fine?  #8203; I don't plan to do anything intense as of yet, but I want to learn how to do complex sound design over the next couple of years.</TEXT>

Or is it saying that because i tried via the app but if i manually typed in my credentials or do it via the website it would sign me in normally?

Anyways since starting my minoxidil journey, I bought my 3rd bottle just now for my 3rd month (progress is okay, just got a 0.5 dermaroller which is fine and doesn #8217;t hurt or bring side affects.. i #8217;ll leave that for another post) They sent me a free bottle of their own locally made minoxidil to try... so thats two months in one go. Should I try theirs first or stick with kirkland this month? Either way I thought it was cool, theirs feels heavier too, maybe its the box..</TEXT>

    <TEXT>So honesty here i followed it to the T for most of it, I had one refeed last Saturday and then I had 2 days where I fell off the bandwagon, i did not binge but i ate a normal deficit of mac Donald #8217;s and chocolate. Never went above maintenance though. If i concentrate i can get back on it, its not too hard but in my experience if i dont prepare food or if i make food but cant eat it i just use that as an excuse to stop psmf. Now i am wondering if i should do another week or two and be more organised on psmf or do a 15-1800 calorie diet for the next few weeks orrrr just do a typical 2100 diet for another 10 weeks.. My personal tips, get ENOUGH sleep !! Meal prep even if its in the morning for the evening. intermittent Fast, try and do OMAD too or within a short window like 2-3 hours. Make your food interesting, psmf isnt even that bad if you know how to cook. Also yes it is a kind of tough diet but if you really want it you can get it, also get your electrolytes and lots of water, the electrolytes dont matter too much after the first 2-3 days. Take vitamins and extra zinc for my fellas out there. Dont do excessive cardio also.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>If I reset my whole Mac would I be able to use the 3 month Ableton trial? I lent my laptop and didn't realise my brother had already used it when I was away. Please note I want to eventually buy it as I have a massive discount. I most likely will buy it within the next 14 days. (I already messaged Ableton about extending but they weren't happy about that..)</TEXT>
