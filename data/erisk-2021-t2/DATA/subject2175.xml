    <TEXT>Singapore-based exchange DragonEx says it has been hacked for an undisclosed amount in a number of cryptocurrencies. DragonEx announced the news on its official Telegram channel on Monday, stating that, on Sunday, March 24, it had suffered a #160;cyberattack that saw cryptocurrency funds owned by users and the exchange  #8220;transferred and stolen. #8221; No information has yet been provided on the value of the losses. On Sunday, apparently as the breach was first being discovered, DragonEx first took its platform offline saying it was upgrading its systems. Later the same day, it announced that it was  #8220;still working on system maintenance, #8221; before finally disclosing that it had been hacked yesterday.  #8220;Part of the assets were retrieved back, and we will do our best to retrieve back the rest of stolen assets, #8221; DragonEx said in Monday #8217;s Telegram announcement. The exchange further said that it has informed several judicial administrations, including Estonia, Thailand, Singapore and Hong Kong about the attack, adding:  #8220;We #8217;re assisting policemen to do investigation. All platform services will be closed and the accurate assets loss recovery situation will be announced in a week. For the loss caused to our users, DragonEx will take the responsibility no matter what. #8221; In updates on the hack today, DragonEx #8217;s Telegram admin #160;provided wallet addresses #160;for 20 cryptocurrencies to which the stolen funds had apparently been transferred. The list included the top five cryptos by market capitalization: bitcoin (BTC), ether (ETH), XRP, litecoin (LTC) and EOS, as well as the tether stablecoin (USDT) for which six destination addresses were provided.  #8220;We earnestly request help from all our fellow exchanges and other industry strength, please help us to investigate and traced the assets, freeze them and stop the assets flows, #8221; the exchange said. The admin added that stolen crypto assets transferred by the hackers to the Huobi and gate.io exchanges have already been blocked.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Chartwells, which caters food for all five residential colleges, is linked to several other cases. Several students from the other three residential colleges  #8212; Cinnamon College, Residential College 4 and Tembusu College  #8212; told TODAY that they had reported sightings of bugs in their food in the past. Chartwells is owned by the world #8217;s largest catering firm Compass Group, which reported 23 billion pounds (S$40.67 billion) in revenue last year. NUS said Chartwells is under investigation but the catering firm is still preparing food for all five residential colleges, including RVRC. Asked why the university still employs the services of Chartwells despite the incidents over the past two years, the NUS spokesperson said:  #8220;The Office of Housing Services (OHS) has instructed dining operator Chartwells to conduct a comprehensive review of their processes at all five residential colleges on campus. #8221;</TEXT>

    <TEXT>NUS said it instructed the caterer, Chartwells, to wash and sanitise its kitchen and serving areas, and conduct thorough inspections of the kitchen after these cases. It added that Chartwells activated pest control specialists after the incidents were reported. However, in response to queries, a spokesperson for Chartwells said:  #8220;We are not aware of the situations mentioned. #8221;  #8203; As another student puts it:  #8220;Chartwells always gets complaints, everyone knows... but in the end it #8217;s the aunties receiving the blow (if we complain). #8221; [https://www.todayonline.com/singapore/multiple-cases-food-poisoning-hygiene-lapses-nus-residences-past-two-years-say-students](https://www.todayonline.com/singapore/multiple-cases-food-poisoning-hygiene-lapses-nus-residences-past-two-years-say-students)</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Some of the top MLMs in Singapore are practically household names. How many do you know? **HERBALIFE:** #160;This company sells products like nutritional shakes, weight management tablets and dietary supplements. You join the company by buying their products and then trying to resell them. **AMWAY:** #160;Amway is like an MLM version of P amp;G, and their products include protein powder, energy drinks, makeup products, shampoo and home cleaning products. Members must pay a subscriber's fee as well as purchase their own household products from the company, and then try to generate revenue by recruiting more members. **MARY KAY:** Sounds like a normal beauty and cosmetics brand, but this company actually operates by selling starter kits and products to members who then go on to try to resell them. **ATOMY**: A skincare line where you make more money by recruiting people. With no sign-up fee, this makes it a zero-risk MLM if you really want to join one. But you'd still have to influence people around you to buy in order to make profits. \[Update 22 May 2019: In a previous version of this article we stated that there is a sign-up fee and a monthly membership fee. Atomy is free to join with no sign-up fee, free cancellation and monthly costs.\] **ELUSYF:** They sell antiaging and skincare products to their members, who then try to make their money back by recruiting new members. **RIWAY:** #160;Their main products are a placenta supplement that's supposed to be anti-aging, and a perfume. Not the easiest products to sell, which is why their members try to recruit new members to make back the money they've spent.</TEXT>

Miss Raihanah, who plays for the Vanquishers Hockey Club, had collided with an opponent during a 4-1 defeat by Crescent Hockey Club in the National Hockey League match. The incident at the Sengkang Hockey Stadium also sparked concerns after a delay in medical assistance. With no medical personnel on standby, it took at least an hour before an ambulance was called. Google shows Sengkang Hockey Stadium and Sengkang General Hospital are 5 minutes away. Why was there a 1 hour delay?</TEXT>

    <TEXT>#justiceforjevain Excerpts From The New Paper dated 20 June 2019  #8220;He had a dismal driving record, yet Tan Bock Lim still chose to drive the 4,000kg minibus when the road was wet. That decision cost a man his life. #8221; #160;  #8220;From 1996 to 2017, Tan had a total of 12 speeding records, three incidents of careless or inconsiderate driving, and one incident each of beating a red light, failing to signal and using his mobile phone while driving. #8221;  #8220;For causing death by negligent act, Tan could have been jailed for up to two years, or fined, or both. #8221; Eventual Sentencing #160;  #8220;He was jailed for four weeks and disqualified from driving for five years after he ran over and killed 25-year-old Jevainthiran Rajendran. #8221; 4 weeks for a life? Disqualified from driving for only for 5 years? Nothing is equivalent to a life lost but THIS verdict is not acceptable. Help us be the voice of someone who can't speak for himself.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>The oft-cited obstacles to parenthood, such as finance and career, have been tackled by the organisation  #8220;for many years #8221;, but according to Ong,  #8220;in the last four years, we felt that more and more, the lack of fertility health wellness in Singapore is a hole that can be plugged.  #8220;(Based on previous studies and conversations), it sounds like people do not know about fertility before they embark on parenthood. #8221; For instance, Dr Tan Kai Lit, an obstetrician, gynaecologist and maternal fetal medicine clinician from Thomson #8217;s Women #8217;s Centre, noted couples that he sees are typically not aware of how much unprotected sexual intercourse is required to conceive.  #8220;Some couples come to me after three months of trying and say they have difficulties in conceiving. But (they) should theoretically be trying out for a year and if they can #8217;t get pregnant, that #8217;s the definition of having difficulties in conceiving, #8221; said Dr Tan.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>SINGAPORE - A 49-year-old man was arrested after the double-decker Go-Ahead bus he was driving hit a pedestrian on Friday (Aug 2). The police said they were alerted to an accident involving the bus and a pedestrian along Marine Parade Road, towards Bedok South Avenue 2, at 11am. The pedestrian, a 72-year-old woman, was unconscious when she was taken to Tan Tock Seng Hospital. The driver was subsequently arrested for causing grievous hurt by negligent driving. The police are investigating the incident. Chinese-language newspaper Shin Min Daily News reported that the woman was crossing the road when her head hit the windshield of the bus. In a video making the rounds on Facebook, the woman can be seen lying on the road next to the bus. Another woman crouches beside her, seemingly tending to her. The windshield of the bus is cracked. A crowd of passers-by gathers around the injured woman, while the bus driver says: "The light was green, but she still wanted to cross the road." In response to media queries, the company said that a bus on service 43 was involved in the accident, and the company had contacted the injured woman's family, Shin Min reported. Go-Ahead apologised for the incident and said that it was assisting the relevant authorities in their investigations.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>In a new series of animated shorts released by Disney Channel South-east Asia, the first short shows Goofy deliberating on whether to sample Donald Duck's creation or Mickey Mouse's satay. The six-part series, which can be caught on YouTube, is a boost for tourism in both countries as the shorts will feature Mickey Mouse, Minnie Mouse, Donald Duck, Daisy Duck and Goofy in settings that showcase local food, architecture and fashion. Netizens have given the thumbs up to the first short called Master Hawker, which even has Goofy saying "shiok" and features a very familiar food street with hawker stalls selling other treats like assam laksa and chendol.</TEXT>

The one-day celebrations will culminate with dazzling fireworks displays at each of the five sites. [https://www.ndp.org.sg/heartlands.html](https://www.ndp.org.sg/heartlands.html)</TEXT>

The "regardless of race" portion on 9 Aug is a phrase in our national pledge, which will be recited during Singapore's national day. It is sort of ironic.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>E-scooters have become an indelible part of Singapore's culture. We see them zipping past walkways, most appearing without warning and catching unsuspecting residents off-guard. Sometimes, they appear on the news for all the wrong reasons - another e-scooter collision, e-scooter fire burns down a house, e-scooter riders caught for ignoring LTA rules. Since NDP is a celebration of our Singaporean identity, it is only fitting that we acknowledge this growing segment of the population. In the same way that our Leopard tanks or SCDF vehicles drive past the Padang, we can have a contingent of e-scooter riders zip past the Padang with their flashy lights and siam diu music. It will give a chance for our e-scooter riders to show off their fancy (but also illegal) modifications. The entire nation will be watching on TV which sure beats trying to attract attention by speeding down a pedestrian path like it's the Formula 1 Grand Prix. #160;Since the roads are cleared during NDP, e-scooter riders can finally live out their daredevil fantasies and speed along without those pesky pedestrians getting in their way. #160;</TEXT>

    <TEXT>To save lives, a Singaporean driver deliberately caused a road accident. Education consultant Chalmers Chin was driving to work in his Volkswagen Golf GTI on the Pan-Island Expressway (PIE) in Bukit Timah at about 8.30am on Tuesday when he saw a ComfortDelGro taxi moving erratically in front of him. The taxi was weaving in and out of the middle lane, its hazard lights were blinking, and a female passenger in the front seat was reaching over to the driver #8217;s side, trying to steer the vehicle. Another female passenger sitting behind had partially opened the rear door and was waving for help. The traffic was heavy, but Mr Chin, 31, did not hesitate.  #8220;I sensed something was wrong, #8221; he said. Driving along the right lane, he overtook the taxi, which was travelling slowly, and then cut in front of it to place his own car in its path. The taxi then struck the rear of his eight-year-old car  #8211; as he knew it would  #8211; and the passenger in front managed to steer it to the road shoulder as it came to a halt. Mr Chin said it was the only way to stop the outof-control vehicle. He rushed to the cab and found it had four passengers  #8211; the two women and two children. The cabby had fallen unconscious at the wheel, and The Straits Times understands that he might have suffered a heart attack. Mr Chin, along with a few paramedics who happened to be attending to another accident nearby and another driver, helped to pull the cabby out of the taxi. Police said the taxi was on the PIE travelling towards Changi Airport. The taxi driver, a 60-year-old man, was unconscious when he was taken to Tan Tock Seng Hospital, where he subsequently died. While Mr Chin #8217;s quick thinking may have saved the four passengers from a more serious accident, he was saddened by the cabby #8217;s death.  #8220;It is unfortunate that he didn #8217;t make it, #8221; said Mr Chin. And of his decision to let his own car get hit to stop the taxi, he said:  #8220;I calmed my nerves and did what I needed to do. #8221; He said he was worried about causing a chain collision, as there were other cars on the road.  #8220;So, I had to judge the distance between my car and the taxi to minimise the impact of the two vehicles. #8221; He said he was driven to do this partly because he has a five-monthold son.  #8220;I was thinking of my child when I stepped up. When I saw that the woman was with two children, I could imagine the stress she was going through, #8221; he said. ComfortDelGro thanked Mr Chin for his  #8220;swift and heroic action #8221; in stopping the taxi, adding that the company #8217;s insurers will be following up on the report he filed. The firm is also assisting the family of the cabby who died. Mr Chin said he had not worried about the potential damage to his vehicle when he acted. His car suffered a hairline scratch on the bumper from the accident.  #8220;My aim was to get the car to stop. I did what I could to help, #8221; he said.  #8220;And I will do it again. #8221;</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Please support this old granny who is located along the 1st floor of Thomson VTwo corridor. She is a very honest old granny as she will tell you that she sells fruits which she bought from Sheng Shiong and will sell it at a slightly higher price for a living. But because of that,noone is willing to buy from her as they can get direct from Sheng Shiong at a cheaper price. She is 97 years old, so weak and fragile but still make an effort to come out every Friday,Saturday and Sunday,pushing a grocery trolley full of fruits,potatoes etc,which is super heavy given her age. Just for a living. Hopefully fellow singaporeans can help make her time and effort worth it over here during that three days weekly(Fri,Sat,Sun - 11am - 5pm) by making an effort to come down and support her. *she did mentioned that due to her old age,her vision and hearing is failing her and also her memory. She might not rmb you to be coming and visit her like me,passing her some cash and buying her food and drinks. But,she also did mention that for that instance,she is very happy. She blames herself if she cant rmb you. Help her to get food on her table and her daily allowance. Not help CEO's of listed company buy their dream house or car. #careforelderly #shopfromtheneedy</TEXT>

    <TEXT>When Mr Koh first reported what he saw to the Daiso staff, they didn't find any incriminating video because Lim used a concealed app. Lim was busted only after he confronted Mr Koh about the incident to challenge the witness #8217; claims. Mr Koh responded by calling the police #160;who conducted a forensic examination of Lim #8217;s phone and found the 19 videos.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Workers' Party leaders Sylvia Lim and #160;Low Thia Khiang do not need to recuse themselves from financial matters, Aljunied-Hougang Town Council (AHTC) said in a media release on Saturday (Nov 30). The statement comes after Parliament earlier this month called upon the town council to discharge its responsibility by requiring the two leaders to recuse themselves "from all matters relating to, and oversight over, financial matters of AHTC". The decision was made at its recent quarterly meeting, said AHTC chairman Faisal Manap. Ms #160;Lim and Mr Low #160;were both not at #160;the meeting. The resolution was passed by way of a secret vote, the release said, adding that the council voted 17 to 1 against the recusal.</TEXT>

Rabbit is apparently used in many dishes in Sichuan. Mr Zhang has also applied for a license that allows the restaurant to import rabbit meat. Rabbit meat can be found in the list of meat products allowed to be imported into Singapore.

    <TEXT>"We are happy to annouce that we are the first and only one to release rabbit hot pot in Singapore." - Tong Xin Ru Yi Traditional Hotpot NO! Rabbit owners are NOT happy about this! Did you not know that after dogs and cats, rabbits are the 3rd MOST common household pets in Singapore? In fact, there are millions of companion rabbits all around the world being treasured by their owners as families. We do NOT want to eat our family! #160; On behalf of the rabbit owners in Singapore, Bunny Wonderland and House Rabbit Society Singapore will like to request for Tong Xin Ru Yi Traditional Hotpot to remove this item from their menu. Both organizations have been tirelesly rescuing abandoned rabbits in Singapore and working with rabbit lovers to improve their welfare. For this restaurant to encourage the consumption of our pets, it's totally against all that we have worked hard to achieve. If this dish is allow, does that means there will be cat stews and dog barbeque soon? This cannot happen! We truly hope that the public can make an informed decision about supporting such businesses. Singapore do not farmed rabbits for food and instead, we import them into our country as domesticated pets. As pets, they should be viewed in the same light as other companion animals and given the same respect as a cat and dog would. So please do not support business that undermine our pets as food items! Through this petition, we hope that Tong Xin Ru Yi Traditional Hotpot can realized that rabbit owners in Singapore are ANGRY with the slaughter of our beloved pets as food. While we understand rabbit is an approved consumable meat, we are not ready to eat our pets, our best friends, our family. Please remove this unwelcomed dish from the menu and do not encourage the consumption of our pets in any shape or form in the future!</TEXT>

    <TEXT>The manpower minister has issued three correction directions under the Protection from Online Falsehoods and Manipulations Act (POFMA) against two social media posts made by the Singapore Democratic Party (SDP) and an article on its website. **Dec. 2 sponsored post** A sponsored post on Facebook on Dec. 2 by SDP with a graphical illustration depicting  #8220;plunging local PMET employment. #8221; However, this post may not be accessible on SDP #8217;s Facebook page. **Nov. 30 Facebook post** A Facebook post on Nov. 30, linking to an article on the SDP #8217;s website. The post also included a graphic that claimed  #8220;Local PMET unemployment has increased. The number of foreign PMETs has also increased. Coincidence? We think not. #8221; **SDP article** The article on the SDP #8217;s website itself, dated June 8, 2019. The correction directions require the SDP to include a correction notice on each of the posts, to state that they contain a  #8220;misleading graphic #8221; and  #8220;false statement of facts. #8221; **MOM: Local PMET employment has consistently increased** MOM said that it was wrong to claim that local PMET unemployment has risen. MOM said:  #8220;As reported in the Ministry of Manpower #8217;s Comprehensive Labour Force Survey, local PMETs employment has risen steadily since 2015. #8221; MOM also noted that the two Facebook posts linked to the article, which included the line: #160; #8220;The SDP #8217;s proposal comes amidst a rising proportion of Singaporean PMETs getting retrenched. #8221;</TEXT>

    <TEXT>As some of you might have known, my jaw has been dislocated. Yesterday morning, There was this guy that was pestering me and my friend. Trying to hit on us and all. As i was feeling really uncomfortable about the whole situation as well as his presence, i told him politely to leave us alone and go away countless times. However he refused to budge and instead elbowed my face out of the blue and dislocated my jaw just because we didn #8217;t want to be pestered, just because we wanted our nice alone time. Thank god my friend, Natalia as well as the people that was around who witnessed the assault stayed with me throughout the incident and protected me from more danger. This is a very traumatising experience.. no one should be treated like this... i #8217;m writing this to the public because i #8217;m scared, and i hope that there will no longer be anyone else that have to go through this horrifying experience. At the same time alerting the public of this person so that people can be more wary of him. It's not the first time he laid hands on someone, neither is that his first time he laying hands on a person from the opposite gender....a leopard never changes it #8217;s spots. Benjamin Ng Wei Jie, I hope that this will be a huge life lesson to you...life doesn #8217;t always work the way you want it to. And also, this is not the way to treat a lady. This is not the way to treat anyone. Singapore Police Force please help me.. please save me... I've never thought of this so deeply before, however this happened to me, this time.. I really believe that every single woman anywhere in this world in every country and every state needs to be protected when it comes to situations like this. https://www.facebook.com/story.php?story_fbid=1255574197978998 amp;id=100005792891767</TEXT>

    <TEXT>If all goes to plan, Michelle Lee looks set to be the Progress Singapore Party #8217;s Queen of the West. The PSP is looking to build its stronghold in the West, following secretary-general Dr Tan Cheng Bock #8217;s 26-year reign in the now-defunct Ayer Rajah SMC. Sources tell us that Lee has been earmarked to lead the West charge this time as one of Dr Tan #8217;s prime candidates. Indeed, the 43-year-old lao chio has been seen walking the ground there together with the PSP #8217;s newly-appointed assistant secretary-general Leong Mun Wai. And backed by the PSP, she could even do one better than one-time hot opposition camp favourite Nicole Seah and actually triumph in a GRC or SMC. Lee joined the PSP last year and has since rose to become the party #8217;s vice-chairman. Prior to this, she campaigned for the Singapore Democrats in Holland-Bukit Timah GRC during the 2011 and 2015 General Elections, each time winning around 30 percent of the popular vote. An honours graduate from the London School of Economics, Lee worked for the Monetary Authority of Singapore, Salomon Smith Barney Citibank and Mercer Management Consulting, before moving on to pursue a teaching career.

    <TEXT>According to a credible source, the newly appointed vice-chairman of the Progress Singapore Party (PSP), Michelle Lee Juen, has quit the Party. Lee, who had received much support from Secretary-General Dr Tan Cheng Bock, has just been appointed in Jan 2020. When asked, the PSP declined to comment, but said that they would give their official reply in the next few days. This is the second time that the Party, which has been founded for less than a year, will go through leadership changes within a short span of two months. During the PSP New Year Dinner celebrations in January 2020, Dr Tan had just announced the addition of five members to their Central Executive Committee (CEC) and the appointment of Lee (43 years old) as deputy chairman. Lee had just been seen walking the grounds at Choa Chu Kang with her party member on 23 Jan 2020. However, over the past week, rumours that she was planning to quit the party started to spread. It was believed that the reasons were due to the five additions that had been made to the CEC. Lee also did not attend the PSP #8217;s CEC meeting last Wednesday. Three members of the PSP confirmed with *Lianhe Zaobao* that Michelle Lee had already tendered her resignation to the Party. However, Lee declined to comment when approached by *Lianhe Zaobao.* A PSP member who did not wish to be named revealed that Lee had disagreed with Dr Tan over the nomination of the CEC members and that she had quit over this reason. This member believes that Lee had not quit of her own accord and was likely to have been  #8220;forced to leave #8221;. Another member opined that it was normal for the leadership of the Party to go through disagreements during its initial founding period. This was especially since there had been major changes to the CEC recently. Amongst the members, some are experienced while others are not, hence, disagreements have surfaced. Lee was a member of the Singapore Democratic Party (SDP) and represented the SDP in the Holland-Bukit Timah GRC during the 2011 GE. However, she was later introduced by Dr Tan as a founding member of the PSP. Previously, Dr Tan had praised Lee openly for being diligent, and said that he often brought her along when he met with foreign representatives. He added that he wanted to give her greater political exposure.

    <TEXT>SINGAPORE  #8212; The Ministry of Defence (Mindef) is in the  #8220;final stages #8221; of acquiring four F-35B Lighting II multi-role combat aircraft, with an option to buy eight more, after receiving approval from the US government and Congress. This was revealed by Defence Minister Ng Eng Hen in Parliament on Monday (2 March), during his ministry #8217;s Committee of Supply (COS) debate.  #8220;When delivered, which we hope to be around 2026, the F-35Bs will be deployed in Continental US for training and in-depth evaluation, #8221; said Dr Ng. He noted that Singapore had chosen the F-35B variant of the aircraft due to its ability to take-off from a shorter runway and land vertically  #8211; an  #8220;important feature in land scarce Singapore #8221;.  #8220;F-35Bs performed in the recent Singapore Airshow and their ability to swivel 360 degrees was simply, as some people said,  #8216;awesome #8217;, #8221; he added. More than this, however, the aircraft is also equipped with a full suite of sensors and fighting capabilities, said Dr Ng.

    <TEXT>The National University of Singapore (NUS) said that it has 14 students who are confirmed to be infected with COVID-19. All 14 are imported cases, and had been transported directly from the airport to the hotels to serve their 14-day Stay-Home Notices (SHNs), according to a blog post by NUS Dean of Students Leong Ching on Saturday (29 March). The blog post also said that by this week, NUS will have brought home all its 1,400 students who are overseas on exchange or attachment programmes. Over the last two weeks, the university has already brought home about 93 per cent of these students. All these students will be on SHN as well. Students living in NUS hostels but with homes in Singapore are strongly encouraged to go home, in light of enhanced Ministry of Health safe-distancing measures and the provision of e-learning options. Two students breached SHNs, reported to ICA Leong also wrote in the blog post that two students breached their SHNs, and have been reported to the Immigration and Checkpoints Authority. NUS has submitted video evidence of the two breaches to the authorities. The post added that a breach of SHN is not only subject to the Infectious Diseases Act of the Government of Singapore, but also to the NUS Board of Discipline.  #8220;Those of us on SHNs and Quarantine Order isolation should be scrupulous about not meeting anyone, and keeping to ourselves, #8221; Leong wrote in the blog post.  #8220;Being young and strong, you may think that it will not hit you hard. You may be right (or not), but it will expose many others  #8211; the elderly, the immune-compromised, the very young. #8221; #160;</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Date: 15April Time: 5:45pm Location: Bishan street 22 beside Salvation Army. Bike: FBD8991Z and FBN9553P Was doing my running towards Bishan park when I encountered these 2 guys with a woman riding on the pedestrian walkway. I let them know they should not do that and received a very rude and loud reply that "it is only one minute" follow by a "f\*\*k off". While I wanted to record to make a report, the bike at the back start to reversed toward me in a threatening manner. The woman claimed they are there to drop off donation for Salvation Army and it is more convenient to drive up the pavement when the carkpark is just 20 meters away where she claimed she don't know the way even when it is fully visible .To be fair, the woman was not too rude but the 2 guys are just cowards when I was filming because they just keep quite and tried to threaten me by reversing his bike towards me. To add to their cowards behavior, they started to shout vulgarity at me when they ride off. I believed dropping off donation is not something essential and doing it during this period of CB locked down is prohibited. Also, having 3 persons doing this donation drop off is definition unnecessary which further violate the CB rule. I really wonder why we continue to tolerate such irresponsible behavior from these people. Not only they had no regards to other road users safety, they also have no respect to our country law and think they can do whatever want here.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Esprit Holdings will close all its stores in Asia outside mainland China as part of its effort to cope with challenges posed by the coronavirus pandemic. The Hong Kong-listed fashion house announced on Monday (April 27) that it will close 56 shops in Singapore, Malaysia, Taiwan, Hong Kong and Macau by June 30. Those stores represent less than 4 per cent of the group's global turnover, and the closures are part of the company's "restructuring initiatives to focus resources and recalibrate operations" amid the pandemic, it said.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>A nurse shares the ordeal that his family has been undergoing for the past few days on his Instagram account where his neighbour had mocked, hurled vulgarities, spraying disinfecting solution and cursing at his family every time they come back to their home. The Instagram user "jibby4g" whose wife is also an essential service worker, posted short videos of the encounters between them and the next door neighbour. In posting the video, the male nurse wrote, "This is how it looks like coming home now. Doubt it will stop as long as we are neighbours and as long as i am working as a nurse." He shared that they had been good neighbours for the past 5 years and said,  #8220;suddenly after this pandemic happen, they knew that we are frontlineers and this is the treatment we receive. #8221; Even the parents who fetch their kids were also allegedly verbally abused and sprayed. According to the male nurse, the family made a report at the police station after some of the sprayed disinfection solution got onto the daughter's face. Fortunately, the solution did not get into the eyes. The family was advised to lodge a magistrate report separately as the Police cannot take any action without a court order. "After the report, my family is still thinking if we should pursue the case cos we will still be neighbours. I am still working as a nurse. Will things change for the better." wrote the male nurse. He thanked all those who have written kind words on his instagram post and asked that people help bring awareness to the discrimation faced by frontline officers, "Thank you to all for the support, prayers and concerns towards me and my family. Please continue to do so and bring awareness so that no one will live in fear and no frontliners nor essential service staff have to go through this."</TEXT>

    <TEXT>On 10 Jun, Facebook user Jasper Quak took to the social media platform to express his views about SIM-RMIT #8217;s decision.  #8203; This is going to be a long post, but I hope you take some time to read and share so that this message can reach out to everyone. These are not my photos, and I am not a student of this class. I believe most of us went through primary, secondary and tertiary education and all of us have a common understanding that when a student cheats in the exam, that student will be punished and would be given a F grade in that particular subject or module. This is to ensure fairness within the school or cohort and also to illustrate the importance of integrity to students. However, RMIT thought otherwise. According to my friend, her results for this module was graded as  #8216;Results Not Finalised #8217; and thereafter she received this announcement as shown in the photos. In light of the Covid-19 situation, exams were converted to online assessment. Apparently, some students were caught sharing unauthorised information during the online assessment and RMIT decided to come to a preposterous decision. They claimed that they regard this incident very seriously and therefore, the exam should be invalid and there will be an additional assessment to ensure the accuracy of the final grade for all students. The exam was on 4th May, results were released on 28th May. Prior to this announcement, there were no information given to students. All they received was to prepare for a retest a week later. Why should students bear the consequences of someone else #8217;s wrongdoing? I believe the logical approach is to take action against the students that were involved in the breach of academic integrity. Most students spent tremendous amount of time and effort to prepare for the exam and at the end of the day they were rewarded with injustice. SIM being the leading private education institution in Singapore that aims to build competencies and skills for students which are essential to thrive in the real world. Well, what sort of message is the institute trying to convey through this incident then? Therefore, my friend wrote to the lecturer, and their explanation was  #8220;Please be assured that RMIT and SIM view quality and integrity of our programs very seriously and thus, a second round we are incorporating a timed assessment and this will allow a narrower window in which the assessment needs to be completed and submitted which reduces the likelihood of breaches of academic integrity. #8221; And once again, they did not provide adequate information and details about the situation nor telling us their plans of action against those students that cheated. From my point of view, it seems like RMIT is trying to get rid of the issue in the shortest possible time without any hassle. A few days later, a lecturer responded and summarised all the students #8217; complaints in a PDF. You can take a look in the pictures provided. Students have actually provided a few alternatives to the retest, such as having the students involved in the cheating to retake instead of the entire cohort. And what the lecturer said was  #8220;the equity issue will not be resolved if only the students impacted by the breach retake the assessment. #8221; They actually think that equity issue will resolve if the entire cohort takes the retest when 1 or 2 students cheated. It may solve the equity issue for the cheaters, but not the students that gave their 100% in the first exam. I just feel that this is unethical, one-sided and unjust by RMIT. Look at the answers given by the lecturer, it just look like they are taking a detour and back to where it started, retest. My intentions are not trying to put down the school nor shaming them and I doubt this will change anything. I just felt that student #8217;s rights were being compromised in this situation. They merely came up with such absurd decision and expect students to accept and condone with such behaviour from those students. Furthermore, there isn #8217;t any choice for the students based on the lecturer #8217;s response and therefore, putting it here could be the only way for students to have a chance to speak for themselves. You may wonder why I chose to go through all these when I am not taking this module, let #8217;s just say that I understand the hardship of these students and the amount of pressure and stress especially for part time students who handles both work and studies concurrently and I don #8217;t wish to see their hard work be in vain. For what it #8217;s worth, I hope this message is beneficial to current and future students of SIM, and also to other institutions so that they would know what to anticipate in the event that such incidents were to be happen again. With all due respect, I hope both RMIT and SIM can reconsider their decision and make things right for all students.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Humble request to our Singapore Government. It is really annoying to see such honest mistakes sprouting from our government agencies. Injustice is being done to our Tamil Language! which is one of our 4 language. Even Singapore spelt in Tamil seems to be wrong!! Disappointing!! Our government must step in and arrange a task force to ensure such glaring mistakes are not made in future! Looks like we Indians really need a minister in Singapore, the minister must be able to look into the issues related to our Tamil Language and as well as the welfare for the Indian community of Singapore. In recent years more such errors are being made by lots of confusion and it is becoming very norm and yes we Indians do have many other languages just like our Chinese friends who have their very own dialects. Mandarin was made a common language in Singapore to bind our Chinese friends. We Indians were also like them during the period before 1990s. Tamil was the only option for us to take as our 2nd Language in MOE schools till 1990s but now we Indians are allowed opt our own mother tongue as 2nd Language. The basket containing our Indian languages are actually over-flowing. How about having other dialects as an option for our Chinese friends as well, why depriving them from taking their own mother tongue in schools. Well I belief if MOE allows them to do so, it will really look very messy and the binder ingredient that is "Mandarin" will loose it's essence. Coming back to where I started from, We Indians in Singapore are loosing that same essence without the binder ingredient of having only Tamil as a 2nd Language. Don't you think by allowing many options for 2nd language for our Indian community has caused such confusions and errors to be made all over the red dot?, so MOE, do consider keeping Tamil as the only 2nd Language and allow all other Indian languages to be taken as a 3rd optional language just like Arabic and Bahasa Indonesia and depending on their proficiency level based on their mother tongue. At the same time it is very disappointing that our only Tamil Media in Singapore, "Vasantham Central", "Media Corp Seithi" using transliterated version of their brand name. Instead of including Tamil fonts in their Logos as well as in their Facebook name. Tamil Seithi division has been using Tamil fonts for the title "Seithi" without their logo for quite some time and have used "COVID-19" in English while reading out the news. If "COVID-19" is a brand name than it is clearly understood and fair enough that we have to transliterate respecting the brand name, As for a disease that have a name in Tamil, wonder why the Tamil Seithi news team have to mention it in English. Our children are watching the news too and they are learning from the media! especially now that everything is almost going online. Anyway there are non-Indians who read the transliterated version of "Vasantham" and they do not know the meaning and at the same time those who know the meaning of "Vasantham" especially our SG Pioneers #SGPioneers are unable to read it in English and obviously do not know what is the logo saying. I really appreciate it if a task force could be arranged by our Singapore Government to ensure no more mistakes are being made to our Tamil Language via media, posters, flyers and so on so forth. It is very annoying and looks real bad on our nation where one of our official language is not well taken care of. Posters showing negativity most of the time resembles Indians and Malays mainly. Official posters showing our four ethnic group fails to showcase the right group of people. Posters and banners hung by Community Clubs and Residents' Committees doesn't include all four official languages of Singapore, especially for National day. Hopefully new banners and publicity materials for National Day 2020 carries all four offical languages and of course not forgetting Deepavali banners where Tamil Language always goes missing in most of the zones and yes it is called "Deepavali" in Singapore's context and nothing else. Please ensure all four languages of Singapore are respected as they are and respect the people using these four languages. Ensure all government sectors have staffs who can read, write and converse in at least 2 of our four languages so that services could be provided in time for all people of Singapore at all times, instead of looking for people to work as volunteers only during a seasonal or pandemic period. i.e English and Tamil / English and Chinese / English and Malay. Not a reply but Look forward to prompt action from our Singapore government. Looks like all these are not been look into at all despite the number of reminders voiced out by many Singaporeans right there. Along with taking care of the pandemic situation in Singapore, please also look into such important areas. There are several departments looking into various issues under one roof and another department can always be started to look after our four official languages as well. We have that power within. Thanks to our friends who have highlighted their concerns with the pictures taken by them. At Westen Union branches and Many Safe Entry Zones. Gibberish Tamil Words are a real eyesore and CHildren are laughing. Hope this is not a Genuine Mistake. Once ok but almost every posters??? Something is not right and Somthing has to be done!... Tks to Mr Arul for capturing the pictures at Western union, kerbau road - little india I am sure these posters are posted islandwide!!... Again failed to proof read !!

    <TEXT>Singaporeans will have to go out to vote on 10 July when they would have preferred to stay safe from the risk of getting COVID-19. Almost three months after lockdown began, new cases still remain stubbornly in the three-digit range, a result of the PAP #8217;s poor handling of the pandemic. The resulting economic damage could have been avoided. Retired senior civil servant Philip Yeo once put it bluntly: the government is suffering from  #8216;Eunuch Disease #8217;. There are no leaders that possess the spark, only  #8216;paper shufflers #8217; who  #8216;exist to keep the emperor happy #8217;. Conflicts of interest are rampant throughout government. PAP leaders and MPs are related or very closely associated to key persons all over - at Temasek, the Auditor-general, the Attorney-general to name a few. There is so much  #8220;ownself check ownself #8221;. There is only narrow group-think that prevails in today #8217;s PAP government, lacking rigour in discussion and debate on policies that shape our country. Singapore has suffered greatly as a result and people are angry and frustrated. In this COVID-19 election, the people of Singapore must seek accountability. We must vote for change. We must create a first-world parliament to strengthen the DNA of collective leadership in Singapore. We need to vote for our future and for our children #8217;s future, and not for past PAP glories. There are many men and women, old and young, of considerable calibre, passion and compassion in the alternative line-up who can help build a stronger, better Singapore. I have been privileged to meet some of them, and I know they will bring the diversity that we so desperately need. A truly diverse parliament is a win for the people of Singapore. This election is our opportunity to end the status quo of the supermajority. We can have our voices heard in Parliament. The PAP is no longer listening. The PAP vision of meritocracy has become a fiction. Instead of space to grow and prosper, our citizens are slowly suffocating from fear and stress. Singapore has become a country where we have very little say in how we live. There is little space in Singapore to be what we want to be, to say what we want to say, to grow, to prosper. Many Singaporeans feel they are running a rat race in a maze designed by the government, which decides who to dispense rewards to. The chosen few are given a nice big slice of cake. For those who are not scholars or generals or privileged, there are only crumbs. In this maze, the PAP government of today can create dead-ends, move walls, close off the exits. It can wield POFMA to silence, and defamation suits to ruin and bankrupt, those who disagree. It can choose to retain a long outdated discriminatory law. It can prosecute a single person for an illegal public assembly. Indeed, during Covid-19, it is investigating 2 young persons who separately stood up in public on concerns about climate change. The PAP can change the Constitution and deny Singaporeans a chance to elect the president. It can do this because the PAP has an overwhelming majority of the seats in Parliament. It can crush HDB owners #8217; dreams. It can sit on CPF savings. It can hike GST at will to raise revenue for a government that has undisclosed billions in secret reserves. It can expose us to the risk of COVID-19 by prioritising politics over our lives. It can dismiss the risk of infection in crowded dormitories for foreign workers. When decisions produce poor results, the government can selectively use statistics and surveys designed to trivialise our fears, and imply that our concerns are unfounded. It can baldly tell us,  #8220;In Singapore, no one will be left to walk his journey alone. #8221; When he ascended to become Prime Minister in 2004, Lee Hsien Loong promised. #8220;We will continue to expand the space which Singaporeans have to live, to laugh, to grow and to be ourselves. Our people should feel free to express diverse views, pursue unconventional ideas, or simply be different. We should have the confidence to engage in robust debate, so as to understand our problems, conceive fresh solutions, and open up new spaces, #8221;  #8220;Ours must be an open and inclusive Singapore. #8221; He has not kept his word. Singapore should not be a maze where people are denied a say in how the country #8217;s riches are shared, where those who struggle and sacrifice every day have no voice. The PAP is in control of the maze, and it does not care. Make your vote in this COVID-19 election count. Choose a Singapore where the daily struggle and sacrifice pays off for all, not just for the  #8216;natural aristocracy #8217;. For Singapore #8217;s future, this has become an imperative. We must vote to end the super majority. Singapore wants different.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Chinese President Xi Jinping on Tuesday said China would work with Singapore to  #8220;overcome distractions #8221; to safeguard regional stability, in remarks some experts interpreted as a subtle  #8220;reminder #8221; not to take sides as Washington and Beijing spar over the South China Sea and other issues ranging from trade to technology to human rights.The remarks, made to Singapore Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong in a phone call, came a day after Washington rejected Beijing #8217;s territorial claims in the South China Sea and follow claims by China #8217;s foreign ministry that the United States is disrupting regional peace and stability in the disputed waters.  #8220;Xi said that the bilateral relationship is standing at a new historical starting point, and that the two sides should hold celebrations in flexible and diversified forms, so as to deepen public support for their friendship, #8221; reported Chinese state news agency Xinhua.  #8220;China stands ready to work with Singapore to overcome distractions and jointly safeguard regional peace and stability. #8221; The Chinese embassy in Singapore said Xi spoke to Lee to congratulate him on winning the city state #8217;s July 10 general election, in which the ruling People #8217;s Action Party retained its decades-long grip on power. On the same day, Xi spoke to Thai Prime Minister Prayuth Chan-ocha to discuss, among other things, enhanced cooperation in developing drugs for Covid-19, state broadcaster CCTV reported. Thailand and the Philippines are the only two of 10 Southeast Asian states to have security alliances with the US. Singapore #8217;s Ministry of Foreign Affairs, in a three-paragraph statement, said Xi had in his call with Lee noted this was the 30th anniversary of China-Singapore ties. Both leaders said they welcomed bilateral cooperation to address the fallout from the Covid-19 pandemic. Singapore is among the first countries to have a  #8220;fast track #8221; travel agreement with China. It has a deal with six mainland provinces to facilitate the resumption of air travel for official and business purposes. While some observers described the exchange as a routine post-election call by the Chinese leader, Dylan Loh, an assistant professor of international studies at Nanyang Technological University, said it was  #8220;inevitable #8221; that people would speculate there was more to it. He cited the growing disagreements between the US and China over the pandemic and heightened maritime tensions. *Global Times*, published under the auspices of the Communist Party mouthpiece *People #8217;s Daily*, quoted Chen Xiangmiao, an assistant research fellow at the National Institute for South China Sea Studies, as saying that Xi #8217;s phone call with Lee and Prayuth,  #8220;two of the most important Asean countries, clearly send a signal to the US that China #8217;s relations with countries in this region are not as fragile as Washington has imagined #8221;. The *Global Times* report quoted Chen as saying that  #8220;Singapore is dubbed a  #8216;strategist #8217; in the region, and as Lee has said publicly, Asean countries do not wish to take sides between China and the US, which basically lays the direction for Asean countries #8217; stance between the two superpowers #8221;. The Singapore leader has previously said the city state will not take sides and has tried to keep relations on an even keel with the two superpowers. He has highlighted Singapore #8217;s strong security ties with the US, from whom it buys advanced equipment, and how US companies invest more in Singapore than firms from any other country. He has also stressed that China is Singapore #8217;s biggest trading partner. China claims a vast expanse of the South China Sea and four Southeast Asian states  #8211; Malaysia, Vietnam, the Philippines and Brunei  #8211; have counterclaims, along with Taiwan. In his statement on Monday, US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo described China #8217;s assertions as  #8220;completely unlawful #8221;, offering Washington #8217;s explicit support for a 2016 ruling of an international tribunal against China #8217;s claims of historic rights in the disputed waters. David Stilwell, the US assistant secretary of state for East Asia, said the next day to a forum there was  #8220;room #8221; to apply sanctions on Chinese officials and companies that pursued  #8220;illegal #8221; claims in the South China Sea. Loh said the  #8220;distractions #8221; referred to in the phone call were probably an allusion to the South China Sea and a  #8220;gentle reminder that Singapore-China relations are bigger #8221; than what is happening in the disputed waterway. Drew Thompson, a former Pentagon official responsible for managing bilateral relations with China, Taiwan and Mongolia, described the conversation as a  #8220;veiled swipe #8221; at the US statement.  #8220;It #8217;s probably also a subtle reminder to Singapore that should they not support China on these things, that China can create distractions as they did the last time for Singapore, #8221; said Thompson. He recalled how Singapore #8217;s relationship with Beijing had been tested in November 2016, when nine armoured vehicles returning from Taiwan  #8211; where the Singapore army conducts regular training  #8211; were impounded in Hong Kong. This had led to suspicions that the move was China #8217;s way of warning Singapore over its close relationship with Taipei.  #8220;That was a  #8216;distraction #8217;, #8221; he said. Thompson said the latest exchange was  #8220;a purposefully vague statement to invoke fear in the mind of a smaller state and leave that smaller state to determine what their worst fears are that China could make come true #8221;. Still, Loh felt Singapore would remain consistent in its approach towards the territorial disputes and would not alter its position just because of the US statements. However, he said the US statement would put pressure on Singapore  #8211; and the 10-member Association of Southeast Asian Nations (Asean) bloc  #8211; to choose sides.  #8220;Even so, I don #8217;t think Asean or Singapore will automatically start choosing sides openly because this would certainly go against Asean and their member states #8217; interests, #8221; he said. Thompson cautioned against painting all Asean member states with the same brush, saying they had different interests, but added that while most supported international law in principle, their governments were unlikely to make any public statements.  #8220;Philosophically, I think they probably agree with Pompeo #8217;s statement but as a practical matter, they don #8217;t want to be involved, and the subject of China #8217;s ire, #8221; he said.  #8220;The safest move for most Southeast Asian countries is to make no response at all. #8221; Chan Heng Chee, Singapore #8217;s former ambassador to the US, said that the US-China rivalry had deteriorated  #8220;far faster than anyone anticipated #8221;.  #8220;There is no doubt we have substantial interests and relations with both powers but we have never been in this place before. We have not felt the pressure and tug of war of both powers, #8221; she said during an online lecture organised by the Singapore-based Institute of Policy Studies on Wednesday evening. Chan added that the South China Sea was now seen as the  #8220;site of the new great game #8221; and there had been no consensus among Asean countries on how to respond.  #8220;What is significant is that we are seeing the emergence of a coalescence of like-minded countries who simply want to carry on doing that business, supporting that growth and development, at a time when the two giants are locked in intensifying competition with each other, #8221; she said.  #8220;Singapore will not be put in a position to make a final choice like marriage. Nor \[is it\] needed. We should not make a choice for as long as we can. Choice will be exercised by each country to line up with the US or China, depending on what initiatives the two powers put on the table. #8221;</TEXT>

    <TEXT>This means that Kasturi Govindasamy Retnamsamy, 40, will not be sentenced on the charges that she had pleaded guilty to earlier. These were one count each of harassment, using criminal force on a policewoman and an offence under the Covid-19 (Temporary Measures) Act. Yesterday, Deputy Public Prosecutor Stephanie Koh noted that Kasturi had already admitted to and been convicted of her offences. But this was an exceptional case, where the offender has a psychiatric condition that contributed to the commission of the offences and she has already served more than two months in remand, the DPP said. It would therefore not be in Kasturi's or the public interest to protract the matter, DPP Koh added. Defence lawyer Diana Ngiam had told the court earlier that her client needed help. Kasturi had also said in a previous hearing that she has "extreme rage" and "multiple personalities" issues. Probation or a mandatory treatment order, whereby offenders undergo treatment for their mental condition in lieu of jail time, were not recommended for Kasturi. ## UNSUITABLE She was also found to be unsuitable for a day reporting order, whereby offenders have to report to a centre for monitoring and counselling as well as undergo rehabilitation. The reasons for her unsuitability were not disclosed in court. Kasturi was spotted not wearing a mask while in Sun Plaza at around noon on April 29. She was holding one in her hand instead. Refusing to put it on when told to, she insulted mall staff and hurled vulgarities at a security officer. Kasturi was at the mall again at around 2pm on May 7. As a condition of entry, she had to scan her NRIC to facilitate contact tracing. Instead, she threw her NRIC onto the table and hurled vulgarities at the mall staff.</TEXT>

    <TITLE>Lee Wei Ling diagnosed with progressive supranuclear palsy</TITLE>
    <DATE>2020-08-11 06:41:15</DATE>
    <TEXT>I have been diagnosed with progressive supranuclear palsy. It is a rather nasty brain disease which starts with a Parkinson #8217;s-like illness that slows physical movements, impairs fast eye movements and balance, resulting in a tendency to fall. This is followed by difficulty swallowing, choking aspiration, pneumonia and death  #8211; for the fortunate. Further progression of the disease will lead to dementia with prominent behavioural changes such as disinhibition and impulsivity. My immediate reaction to the news was  #8220; #24525; #8221;(ren), or endure in Chinese, of which the traditional character has a knife above a heart. I have been practicing  #8220; #24525; #8221; since I was in Chinese school, recognising that life has many unpleasant, unavoidable situations. It would be nice if this entire episode turns out to be a nightmare and that I will wake up. But it is getting increasingly real and inescapable every day. My movements are slow and hesitant and I have difficulty getting up from my futon (yes, I upgraded from sleeping on two exercise mats, one on top of the other, to a comfortable futon on top of the exercise mats). The futon was what my brother Hsien Yang #8217;s kids would use when they had friends sleep over. It gives more cushioning than just exercise mats and the surface is made of woven bamboo strips, making it cool and easy to slide on. But it cannot compare to Zee.dog, the mattress my Shiba Inu puppy sleeps on. I watch with envy as he sleeps like a king, lying flat on his back with his belly exposed  #8211; a sign my dog trainer interprets as being totally relax and confident enough to expose his vulnerable abdomen. I had googled Zee.dog bed and was informed that  #8220;your pet dog spends 80 per cent of its life sleeping. The Zeebed was designed to be the world #8217;s most comfortable dog bed. #8221;8 Even my helper knew about the brand. She said her previous employer #8217;s dog slept on just such a bed. The next question is  #8220;Why me?" but I did not ask it because the obvious answer was  #8220;Why not?". I have had it good for too long. I was born into a middle class family with sensible parents that did not want their children brought up as rich and privileged. My father was Prime Minister of Singapore and we could have stayed in a huge bungalow in the Istana grounds. But he did not want us growing up with the wrong idea of our importance and entitlement. He did not like the idea that if we threw a ball, a butler would run to get it. So we lived in our old pre-war home at Oxley Road. We played with the butler #8217;s children as equals and watched their little television set in their sitting room as their equals. This relationship was maintained through the years and even now, if we happen to cross paths, we greet each other as childhood friends and on first name basis. Over the years I have seen Flora and Stella when their children were admitted to the hospital, usually for asthmatic attacks. John and Aloysius, I have not seen for a long time. I enjoyed school  #8212; both academically and socially  #8212; I even represented Raffles Institution in athletics and swimming. After my  #8220;A #8221; level exams, I did well enough to earn a President #8217;s scholarship and was admitted to medical school. Again I did well academically and topped my cohort. My first taste of failure was at the MRCP (Membership of the Royal Colleges of Physicians) exams. A day after the results were announced, almost all Singapore doctors knew I failed and cheered. That was an important lesson in resilience. I took the exams again and passed it this time. I chose to specialise in paediatrics because I had initially wanted to do veterinary medicine but was dissuaded by my parents. The challenges of paediatrics and veterinary medicine is similar  #8212; in the two, doctors deal with with patients who cannot convey their problems clearly and concisely, and in both, patients may be uncooperative without deliberately being nasty. I then chose to subspecialise in paediatric neurology and was awarded a Health Ministry scholarship for 3 years, training at Massachusetts General Hospital a famous hospital in Boston. On my return, I served my 13-year bond. Unfortunately, I was not really wanted at the paediatric department and was transferred to the neurology department at Tan Tock Seng Hospital. I was the only paediatric neurologist amongst a group of adultneurologists. As epilepsy is the only neurological condition that was treatable at that time, I delved into paediatric epilepsy, which has a wider range of manifestation than adult epilepsy and I became competent as a paediatric and adult epileptologist. I was subsequently given another Health Ministry scholarship and spent one year at the Toronto Hospital for sick children and a few months at the Mayo Clinic and Cleveland Clinic. Each scholarship came with a bond and I served a total of between 15 and 17 years. All in all, I enjoyed my years as a neurologist and epileptologist.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Today, a server at Subway (Kallang Wave Mall) not only refused to allow me entry, but also refused to talk to me and yelled at me for trying to get him to talk to me instead of my friend. He insisted that Subway is a Halal restaurant and guide dogs are not supported by MUIS (they are btw). Guys please share, this goes beyond being uneducated.

    <TEXT>ISKANDAR PUTERI: Johor is looking to build an #160;air-conditioned walkway that will stretch about 350m along its side of the Malaysia-Singapore Causeway. #160; The Johor state government has requested RM30 million (S$9.88 million) in funding from the Malaysian federal government for the walkway, said Johor public works, infrastructure and transport committee chairman Mohd Solihan Badri on Sunday (Sep 13). The allocation request earlier this year was doubled from an initial RM15 million after a redesign to include escalators and air-conditioning, he added on the sidelines of the Johor state assembly proceedings at the Sultan Ismail Building. Under the proposal, the walkway will stretch 350m and end at the border with Singapore, said Mohd Solihan. "For Singapore, I #8217;m not sure how long the distance is going to be," he added. It is estimated that hundreds of pedestrians #160;crossed the Causeway daily on foot before Malaysia enforced the Movement Control Order in March to curb the spread of COVID-19. Although no action has been taken by the authorities so far, pedestrians are #160;actually prohibited on the Causeway, according to Mohd Solihan. Mohd Solihan also #160;said #160;that Singapore has shown interest in extending the proposed covered walkway on its side of the Causeway. He said that several officials from the Singapore #160;Consulate-General in Johor Bahru expressed interest in the project at a recent meeting.  #8220;They asked for the design of the walkway so that they can submit a proposal to their government to extend the walkway, #8221; added Mohd Solihan.</TEXT>
