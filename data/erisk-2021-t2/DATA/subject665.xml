    <TEXT>Lmao tell me about it, I work(ed?) at fucking hobby lobby and they refused to close for the longest time. It got to the point where they were  #8220;practicing social distancing #8221; by only having 10 customers in the store at a time but that still violated the policy since the workers are people too. Finally they closed but it took them forever and I #8217;m not getting jack shit despite them promising me paid leave, I didn #8217;t get an email or a call or anything telling me about the situation. Just saw that it was closed on the website and that #8217;s it. The worst part about this whole thing is the reason they stayed open.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>So it #8217;s just a coincidence that black people have the police called on them, specifically black men, for doing nothing but minding their own business by privileged white people who think a sidewalk is their  #8220;private property #8221;? There #8217;s an extremely slim chance she is  #8220;just insane #8221; but it doesn #8217;t change the fact that this happens all the fucking time. It #8217;s just plain ignorance to pretend this isn #8217;t a side affect of racism.

    <TEXT>I took three years of ASL so I know a little bit about this. It #8217;s called a Chochlear implant and they basically replicate the little hairs in your chochlea with tiny chips, but it will not restore your hearing to be even close to what the natural cochlea is able to pick up. It #8217;s actually pretty controversial among the deaf community to have your child get the surgery done since there is the alternative of accepting the kid is deaf and teaching them sign language while learning it yourself. Some people see it as offensive since they believe being deaf should not be considered a disability and frankly I #8217;m not sure what I truly believe as a hearing person. I don #8217;t know if this should be seen as selfish or not, but I know one thing for sure. This kid and his parents should still learn sign language, because he is still very very hard of hearing and it will be much harder for him if his parents try to exclude him from the deaf community.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Ahh I see. They did start making his sandwich that #8217;s really dumb. They shouldn #8217;t have served him at all if they were serious about the policy, and if it was another coworker who started making it and then the manager stepped in and decided to say no, that #8217;s still bullshit like just let it slide that one time to avoid this kind of tantrum. HOWEVER the tantrum this guy throws is way out of line and highly irrational no matter what, I #8217;m guessing he didn #8217;t have a mask but still. The thing he throws is a bag of chips and the threw away the bottle of coke too. I don #8217;t agree with this guy #8217;s reasoning at all, I still think he should just wear the mask because it #8217;s easy and ridiculous to get this upset over, but I understand why he #8217;s upset and how he takes it more personally (by believing it #8217;s going against his political views/rights). I don #8217;t like wearing a mask either but I don #8217;t care enough to make a big deal over it and if it helps even a little then I want to help/protect others and myself. It #8217;s better than everything being completely shut down like before.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Okay it didn #8217;t Ffs. Basically they shouldn #8217;t have started serving him at all. I #8217;m guessing the employee was a push over and didn #8217;t want to kick him out so they started making his sandwich, but then the manager stepped in and told him to leave. Which is stupid because you #8217;re obviously going to piss the person off because they thought there was no problem so ofcourse they #8217;re going to get mad. I get standing your ground so people don #8217;t walk all over you, but the manager needs to scold the employee for serving him to begin with and apologize to the man for giving him the wrong idea. Give him the sandwich. And tell him to come back with a mask next time or they won #8217;t serve him. Simple as that. I don #8217;t agree personally with this man #8216;s beliefs or political views but I understand why he #8217;s pissed, treating these people like idiots doesn #8217;t solve anything but treating them with patience and understanding will encourage them to understand as well and agree to disagree. And if they don #8217;t? At least you tried and de-escalated the situation the best you could.</TEXT>
