The pay stubs were all online on the employee website that no longer exists, so I don't have access to them. I also didn't have my supervisors number as he only ever contacted me through his company phone and I don't have contact with any of my old co-workers that would possibly have his number. I need this information to file my taxes this year but I have no means to contact my employer or get old pay stubs. Are there any other options?</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Hey, I'm a 21F American who is currently learning German, Russian, and French and am looking for **18+** friends that are native speakers of those languages to practice and make friends with. I would also be able to help with English. I have been learning German since I was 12 but I haven't gotten a lot of practice with native speakers so I'm still not that great at it. I am a beginner in French and Russian. I would love to be able to have friends who speak these languages so we can share language and culture :) I'm also SUPER shy so posting this is quite hard for me I am currently a university history major, and I mostly study European history from the 11th century to the 19th century and film history. I'm also interested in music, literature, theatre, anime, art, and plenty of other subjects. Feel free to DM me for my snapchat and/or whatsapp, whichever you prefer. I don't have reddit mobile so long-term communication won't really be possible here</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I'm (21F) am a full time history major taking 12 credits this semester. I also currently live on campus. I recently had a successful job interview with a certain popular thrift store chain for a full-time retail position (40 hours a week). I know it's technically possible to do both, but every fibre of my being is telling me that this is a terrible idea. Another part of me wants to try it because I need a job BAD and none of the other places I have applied to have responded. The only reason I am even considering it is the money factor. How difficult is it to juggle full time school, full time work, and a social life? It's also worth mentioning that I have ADHD and already have time management issues, which I am very concerned about.</TEXT>
