    <TEXT>The man behind "Transonic" is Robert Musso. https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_Musso I don't know if this is helpful at all, but he seems to be very "big" in this business, but also very unkown for some reason. He worked with artists like Stevie Wonder, Bob Dylan, Whitney Houston and Ozzy Osbourne. He also does movie scores (could this be the connection to Kojima?) "Transonic" was just a pseudonym.</TEXT>

English translation: "Guidelines have been made as we think fit. That is to say, all the relatives who ... (inaudible) ... that they are still directed towards goals in the west. The Ukraine is ruled by the black organization ..." later you can hear something with "merged" (=zusammengeschmolzen). Translated by "LuLuLudens" in an earlier post. Sounds like a TV or radio broadcast.</TEXT>

    <DATE>2019-06-16 03:08:16</DATE>
    <TEXT>At the end of 2016 there were many rumors that Idris Elba would be in the game too. Since the latest trailer seemingly revealed all main characters and without the participation of Idris Elba, do you think that he could be a surprise? Was there any confirmation or official statement that he will be part of the game? Most likely the rumors were wrong and there were never any plans to cast him, but I'm still wondering if there was some truth to it.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Yes, but why release a teaser that has nothing to do with the final game at all? That makes no sense to me. P.T. was not even in 3rd person. It's like the whole Moby Dick thing, but now the tables have turned. You can't promote a game (or a franchise) that is never planned to be released. That's the "taboo" he spoke off. P.T. was a teaser, yes, but not a teaser for Silent Hills.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>So you can also respond constructively, that's great. You have a good point, and I still think that was the original plan (a release for PS4 and PC). But in the last 3 years, every trailer had "Only On PlayStation" in it, except the last one. So, to say "DS was never a PS exclusive" is bullshit. A PC release is still possible of course, but I think it's too much work at this point, because DS was optimized for the PS4 Pro (as a console game). It has also a lot to do with the controls, that's why Kojima only plays the game with a DualShock controller. The Stadia is not that different. Stadia is a competitor for PS Now just like Spotify is a competitor for Sony Music Entertainment. They still manage to work together.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>For train robberies, there is a large tunnel between Annesburg and Bacchus Station where you can rob the train undisrupted. That seems the only way to do a "clean" train robbery.

As far as he understands, his character will be more of an "anti-hero" than a villain.</TEXT>

Because I think that Cliff has nothing to do with The Man in the Golden Mask and his faction at the beginning. I think Cliff is his own man, has his own unit and his own "supernatural powers" to pursue his own goals, who later in the game will allies with the MitGM to achieve a common goal.</TEXT>

    <TITLE>My home system is gone</TITLE>
    <DATE>2019-09-08 07:54:02</DATE>
    <TEXT>(Sorry in advance if this topic was already been discussed) I've just returned to NMS to see what is new and the first thing I have to say is that HG did an awesome job to elaborate the game. The first visit in the new anomaly was awesome! But I have a huge problem with the new update: My home system, and some others too, are gone. The only way to get access on the systems is via space station teleport. They don't exist in the galactic map anymore and were apparently replaced by new systems (which are all titled as "discovered"). So when I travel via space station to my home system (where my base is located) and access to the galactic map, it says that I'm in a different system which is not my home system. Also, there were 5 planets in my home system before the update, now there are only 3 planets left in the system. There is also no way to travel to the nearest system (always out of jump range) or to make a waypoint to my home system (it disappears as soon as I access the galactic map). There was no reset of the universe right? Because this would be the only logical explanation imo. My latest save was from NEXT. Is there any solution to the problem or does anyone have the same problem?</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Yes, I am on PS4 and in Euclid. Okay, I did just that. The coordinates of my home system are 042B:0078:0D55:014F Then I converted the coordinates into glyphs and traveled via portal (yes, I got the Atlas error) and the "new" coordinates are 042B:0078:0D55:00AF (the exact same, except the last three digits). Then I calculated both coordinates with the Pilgrim Star Path app and the locations are both exact the same. Weird.</TEXT>

    <TITLE>Spotify in Death Stranding</TITLE>
    <DATE>2019-09-25 09:09:02</DATE>
    <TEXT>Since we know that we can build little "outposts" in the world of Death Stranding, where we can select songs from our ingame playlist to play, so that other players can discover and hear these songs, wouldn't it be cool if we could connect our Spotify account with the game, so that we can select songs or playlists from our Spotify for specific outposts, so that other players can discover our Spotify songs/playlists? (only audible at the outposts of course, we can not "collect" this songs) From a technical perspective, I see no reason why this would not work, especially because Sony and Spotify have a partnership (so there should be no problems with licenses). What would be the **advantages**? - A literally unlimited number of songs to discover. - We can influence each other, like Kojima did with Low Roar, Silent Poets and Apocalyptica. - We can enjoy our own favorite songs in the game, in a more immersive way than just having Spotify running in the background. - It would be another sort of 4th wall breaking that allows us to connect via "real life" music. What would be the **disadvantages**? - It could require PS Plus, although I honestly see no reason for it. - Ingame music would be meaningless. - Some songs could destroy the immersion of the game or just annoy the player. - Adverts? Usually you have adverts in the free version of Spotify. Adverts in the game while listening to a Spotify playlist would definetely be a big immersion killer. What do you guys think? Will/could this be possible in the final game? And would you like it, or would you rather only listen to the ingame songs and the original soundtrack?</TEXT>

    <TEXT>You will never get a clean proof from Kojima (not even after finishing one of his games), so all we have are interpretations that we can interpret as proof. That's how this game works and that's the reason why this sub got founded in the first place, to discuss, speculate and interpret about Death Stranding, whether right or wrong. Anyway, there are question marks in the title, did you see that? This was not a statement, but a suggestion for a discussion.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I think it has less to do with licensing or that the manufacturers don't want to see their cars damaged. I think it has something to do with the strict secrecy. I mean, even when you see the races on TV, sometimes some things are blurred (steering wheels for example). They don't want to show specific parts of the cars, I think that's the simple reason. They don't even reveal which fuel they use, because everything is "top secret".</TEXT>

    <TEXT>This is because you can't play these maps as you should actually play them. In MW2, Rush was always a fast paced chaos match, which never lasted longer than 4 minutes. Yesterday I had a match on Rust which ended after the 10 minute time limit expired, because both teams were camping on their spawn sides without any movement at all. It's ridiculous. I can't see how maps like Terminal or even Highrise would make fun in this game.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>That's absolutely right. Range in fact does increase (or reduce) damage but it's not shown in the weapon stats (the weapons stats a generally broken). Usually the damage difference should only be noticeable over longer distances (as we know it from shotguns) but it's broken and the distance doesn't matter. So with the right attachments you can make a 2 shot gun into a 1 shot gun, regardless of distance. I don't know why you get downvoted for asking the real questions here.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Yes, that's exactly how it's supposed to be, but as you can see in the video the distance is too short to make a real difference (especially for a marksman rifle), so you can literally say that the second visor (which doesn't reduce the range) ensures that the damage is higher at the same distance (even if that's not technically the case). Edit: So it has nothing to do with the blueprint, that's what I mean.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Go to your class editor and you can see that some visors change the range of your gun. Here, in this video, there were two different visors used within a distance were there shouldn't be any damage falloff noticeable for a marksman rifle but still you have two attempts were one is a two shot and the other is a one shot. So, why is it? Because of the blueprint (P2W)? No! Because of the different visiors he used? Yes! The damage falloff is broken, that's my point. It has nothing to do with blueprints. If the blueprint version had a Cronen C480 Pro Optic visor on it, it wouldn't have been a one shot either.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Good arguments. I can see your point and I agree with almost everything, but one thing that made me interested in Warzone in the first place was that there isn't much RNG because of loadouts. I'm not a fan of typical BR games where you loot for 10 minutes and then just die in a blink of an eye because you got shot in the back. I like to use loadouts so that I can focus on haunting down other players instead of looting for the best stuff. That's what I like about Warzone. I'm scared that this aspect of the game will be ruined with the new loadout costs. I don't want Warzone to be like any other BR. But that's just my personal opinion and as I said before, I totally understand your point.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>No, because it destroys the flow of the game, especially the gas mask animation. I get the "tactial" aspect of these animations but the gas is barely avoidable in the final circle (when you get pushed by other players/teams). It has nothing to do with skill at this point, it's just a disadvantage by game design, because you're forced to put the gas mask on/off. Imagine if you were forced to immediately put on the armor plates you just picked up from the ground. That's just stupid. Here's the thing: If these animations were not in the game, nobody would ask for them. This shows that these animations are unnecessary. They don't add anything to the game.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Instead of just grinding for kills in multiplayer (which doesn't require any skill at all) give us some new camos for Warzone to make an offensive playstyle more rewarding. For example: Camo 1: Kill 15 players in one solo game, 5 times. Camo 2: Kill 10 players in one game, in every Warzone mode (individually). Camo 3: Kill a total of 25 players in one game as a team, 3 times. And so on... This would be tougher than just grind for kills in multiplayer. In addition, players would then have an incentive to play more aggressively. It's just a little adaption to the Obsidian challenge which makes it more challenging and fun in my opinion.

    <TEXT>You can just camp in a corner and you'll get your 15 kills per game (not elegant but effective). Of course it takes time, but skill? C'mon... My point is: I want camos for Warzone. I would like to play more risky and offensive just to get a cool camo for my gun. I really like the idea of the Obsidian challenge, but it's too easy in multiplayer, at least in my opinion. I want a though challenge for Warzone, some sort of "reward" for playing more agressive. Camping can win you a game in solos, but it doesn't get you a lot of kills, so you have to move to get your camo. I think it's a great way to convince players to play more open when you reward them with cool looking weapon camos.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Not only that. It's 3 dimensional aiming (stick/thumb) vs. 2 dimensional aiming (mouse/arm). Purely from a biological perspective (how our brain works) you have always an advantage when using mouse  amp; keyboard, so that's why controller players need an assist to compensate that. You can be a good player even without aim assist, sure, but you'll never have a fair competition against someone who uses mouse  amp; keyboard, unless you're a cyborg.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>It's okay to use aim assist because controller players have to deal with a 3 dimensional stick instead of a 2 dimensional mouse. That's it. There are many studies who can explain you further why aim assist is so important. It has a lot to do with how our brain works, it's not just a stupid feature to make it easier for controller players, there's so much more to it.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I haven't even seen xclusiveAce's video yet, but I'll give it a try. The reason why this community is so f***ed up is because of toxic people like you. You just can't stop being offensive just because someone did a mistake. Sure, I should have watched your video in the first place, that's on me, but I can't take people serious who think that an aim assist is some of sort cheating or an unfair advantage. Those people are the flat earthers of gaming and don't deserve my attention (I'm not saying that you're one of those people, but you sound like one, so I didn't even want to see the video, sry for that). Edit: I saw the video and he had some good points (especially on the input lag topic), but as I said before, I tested it myself and there is a huge difference in aim assist (I even compared it to older clips I saved on my PS4). If the aim assist would work as intended, we would not have this discussion at all, but there are many people who felt that there is something off when it comes to aiming.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>He was in game development and still doesn't know how aim assist works. Aim assist doesn't "lock on" as he often says, it just slows down your sensitivity around an enemy to make it easier to not overaim your target, that's all.

They also act like a national extremists group (only U.S. equipment is being used und only americans are allowed to join the unit), especially with general Shepard, an extremist himself, as their leader.

    <TEXT>There is even a way to get Quiet back as a companion after the story, by completing "Cloaked In Silence" seven times. The mission is then renamed to "[Reunion] Cloaked In Silence".

(most likely not, that would be known by now.) I know that this feature was brought in the game with the 1.06 update, because people complained about not being able to have Quiet as their companion after completing the story (which makes sense from a storywise point of view) but maybe there is more to it than just that?</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Arthur and Kulu weren't even bought with Sarri in mind and that says you all you have to know about our management. Same with CR7. Our management does what it wants, no matter who the trainer is and that's a huge problem. You can see the same at Bayern Munich (Ancelotti and Kovac didn't have any influence in transfers at all). With that in mind, it's hard to build a new system with a new coach. So maybe Allegri is be the best solution for the time being, but I would rather see a motivator like Zidane as our coach, someone who the players can look up to.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Good take, I almost forgot the united game. He's one of the best coaches in the world when it comes to tactical decisions imo. But what he lacks is charisma. We need someone like Zidane, Klopp, Simeone or Guardiola (of course, none of them are available) who can push the team in games like yesterday. We have quality in our team but for some reason there's no fire, no passion, no will and no motivation. Sure, our midfield sucks, but we can do better, even with these players. It's all about mentality and I don't think that Allegri is the long-term solution for this. But that's just my opinion. I hope our management will find a solution that suits the expectations of the club, the fans and - most important - the players.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>1. Just because there's "LIVE" in the corner that doesn't mean that it's actually live. Hell, there are even late night shows who are recorded on afternoon but still has "LIVE" in the corner. "Live pictures" are a lie for itself. Even today, in 2020, you have delays between 30 seconds and two minutes when it comes to live broadcasts, not even to speak of 2001. The most live interviews you see in the news are also pre recorded. 2. Everything that shows up on screen and overlaps the raw footage (these so called "live pictures") has basically nothing to do with the footage itself. So just because the announcement was too early that doesn't mean that it couldn't have happened yet. That just proofs that this footage wasn't live or had a massive delay. 3. Which source? Can you provide a link? Everybody who does some research and has a functional brain will quickly notice that 9/11 was an inside job. But back then, when the internet wasn't etablished yet, TV, radio and newspaper were the only sources which people could get news from. So it was relative simple to manipulate the dissemination of information and it worked. The whole world believed it back then (sure, there were some doubters here and there, but not nearly as many as of today). Even today, you can't question these events in the public, it's still a no-go, although meanwhile 70% of U.S. americans do not believe in the original version which was potrayed by the media and the U.S. government. So I would say they did a great job back then, but in retrospective, of course, that's a joke and so easy to see through.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>The thing is that Dybala doesn't fit to this Juve anymore. He was bought to replace Tevez, as a second striker next to Morata in mind (in a 4-3-1-2). Allegri then changed the system to a 4-2-3-1 with Dybala behind Morata (as a 10). His first seasons were very good in this system but then (when CR7 arrived) Allegri changed to a 4-3-3 system to give CR7 his favorite position on the left wing. Dybala doesn't fit in this system. Maybe we have to try a 4-2-3-1 again, otherwise I don't see a place for Dybala as a starter, as sad as it is.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>People seem not to understand that we need CR7 to win the league. Without him we wouldn't even have placed second this season. Who else would have scored for us then? Higuain? Bernardeschi? Dybala? This squad is even worse than the squad we had back in 2011/12 tbh. Dybala and De Ligt are the only glimmer of hope. Without CR7, we can say goodbye to the Seria A title for the next 2-3 years, since we have a new coach who wants to build a young team that has to adapt to his ideas first before we even think about winning any title. CR7 isn't replaceable for us when we still want to win the league. He is our insurance to be consindered a title challenger at all. I don't want to see Inter winning the title for the next 2 seasons, but that will happen when we sell CR7 now. There's no one else in the world we could buy who is capeble to carry this team on his back like CR7 did this season. And yes, that's all Paratici's fault because he ignored our midfield problems since 2017 (!). Money alone wouldn't solve our problems in this transfer period, so selling CR7 for a "might be" is stupid.</TEXT>

The salary that Dybala demands is completely disrespectful to the club at this point, it's so selfish. When it's all about the money, he should leave then.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>This is absolutely ridiculous. I live in germany and know some of the production staff from Dark. This series was never meant to be that successful. It's a very small team that worked on the series compared to other TV productions (especially compared to other Netflix productions). Almost all actors are known for low budget films/series in Germany. Taking all this into account, it's even more impressive how well the series did for 3 seasons. To think that Kojima had his hands in this projekt is absolutely ridiculous. But I tell you something. Some of the staff there are also huge fans of Kojima's work (he is quite popular here in Germany) like you and I. They have similar interests in literature and films as Kojima, that's why you see the same references in Dark and in Kojima's work. If there is a ruse, Dark is not part of it, I can guarantee you that.</TEXT>

All these subjects where there long before Kojima made his very first game. If you have the same interests it's not that unlikely that you come up with the same ideas. I think it's mix of concidences and conscious innuendos. For example, when you are offered to made a series, wouldn't you took some inspiration from Kojima's work when the setting allows it? You would. I think that happened with Dark as well. I really appreciate what you are doing for this sub. You are one of the last ones left here trying to solve the ruse and I respect that.

With this we could play CR7, Dybala and Kulu in the same formation and also improve our midfield by minimizing it (we only have 2 decent midfielders anyway).

    <TEXT>We played 3-5-2 in 2013 (2x 0:2 against Bayern) and 2014 (we didn't even pass the group stage). Allegri then changed to a 4-3-1-2 in 2015 and we made it to the final (in the final we also played in that formation). After 2015, Allegri changed the formation again to a 4-2-3-1 (we lost again against Bayern, but we were way more competitive this time and a bit unlucky). In 2017 we won 3:0 against Barca and again made it to the final... But then, for some reason, Allegri changed back to a 3-5-2 formation and we got destroyed by Real (1:4, I will never forget that day). Guardiola made the exact same mistake against Lyon.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Why did we win 9 scudettos in a row? Because we are Juve? Sure. Because we had the best team in Italy every year? Absolutely. But the main reason why we became so dominant is because of our pre 2011 era. I always said it and I will say it now: Without calciopoli, we would have experienced the same fate as Inter and Milan. We wouldn't have 38 scudettos now. Calciopoli was the best thing that could happen to us. We started to think differently. We build our own stadium, did set up a new president, Marotta and Nedved joined our board, Conte became our coach etc. etc... We did some smart decisions in these years. But the most important thing was hunger. I never saw a hungrier team than our 2011/12 squad. Something that we have lost on the road since. I don't see this hunger today when it comes to the CL. But that's exactly what you need to win the CL. Look at Bayern now. This Juve team almost feels like it doesn't even care anymore. We got careless. What this team (and the board!) needs is a fucking wake up call. We have to remember these years of absence, were Inter and Milan dominated everything. That's what we need right now, to find to our path of success again. Otherwise, if we stay asleep, we won't be competitive for a very long time. NOW is the time to make changes, not when CR7 retires. Competition is everything in sport. It's the reason why sport even exists. You are always as good as your greatest rival. You have to see the bigger picture here.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I think we already had the right striker with Mandzukic. He's such a good teamplayer, it's a shame that he left the club the way he did. He's now available for free, but I don't think he wants to come back. Also, he's in his mid 30s. There are almost no young strikers on the market who can fit into that role. We could try to get Benzema, but I don't think Real wants to sell him (also, same problem as with Mandzukic, he's not getting younger). Firmino is another one. He's one of the less selfish players and is "only" 28 years old. But the most realistic player at this point is Milik. He's 26 years old and can also fit into that role. But to be honest, we don't even know what kind of player Pirlo is looking for. Is he looking for a starter, or a substitute player? We don't even know if Dybala will be a starter under Pirlo. So it's very hard to pick a player from an outside perspective.</TEXT>

He was so good when we still played in a 4-2-3-1 formation with a fast build up, but today there is no pace, no passion and no beauty in our game at all. Dybala is wasted in this system. We need someone who can contribute his physical abilities to our game, especially with Pirlo's new project in mind (possession/pressing related football). If we get an offer around 100+ million for Dybala, we should accept it. As I said before, I think that Dybala is a fantastic player but I don't think that he's the right player for us right now. He would do much better at a club that is more open to attacking football than we are.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>That could work. But then I'm worried about our CB situation. We need more depth to play with a 3-man defense. Rugani is not good enough, Chiellini is almost done, Bonucci... sorry, but he's overrated + he isn't getting younger. I think the whole CR7 / Dybala dilemma is a bigger problem than we thought. CR7 needs his 4-3-3, while Dybala doesn't fit in a 4-3-3. These both players are incompatible to each other when it comes to find a formation for both of them. It's not only a waste of talent but also a waste of money (wages). I really hope that Pirlo finds a way to play both of them successfully.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Which of this free signings have backfired? Pirlo, Pogba, Llorente, Coman, Khedira, Neto, Alves, Can, Ramsey, Rabiot. All of them got sold or had/still have a good use for us. Khedira is the only one who backfired, because he refuses to leave.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I play this game since 2013 and it was never that bad as it is right now when it comes to traffic NPC's. I really like the role playing part of this game (stopping at red, paying attention to the traffic rules etc.) but this type of playing style is almost unplayable at this point (at least on consoles).</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Conte didn't changed his mind. Tonali would've been an Inter transfer, not a Conte transfer. They weren't even sure whether to continue with Conte or not (maybe they had plans to sack him?). Now that Conte stays they're going for Vidal instead. We don't even know if there was an agreement between Inter and Tonali (these are just rumors). I think Tonali was just waiting for a Milan offer the whole time. But that's just my take on the matter.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>We don't need a striker who plays every game. We have Kulusevski and Dybala who can play different roles in the attack. But it's important to have a back up striker for specific games or for fitness reasons. I think Morata is a good choice here.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>We should play a consistent formation, so that the players get used to it. That's important when you play against big teams in europe, to have a formation you can rely on. I don't think you can compete with a 3-man defense in europe, the past showed that and we shouldn't make the same mistake again. We reached both CL finals with a 4-man defense and should stick to it. Offensively we should play with 2 true wingers and a number 9. Ronaldo can play on his favorised position (LW), Chiesa/Bernadeschi on the RW and Morata as our number 9. It's still up to Pirlo to find a position for Dybala and Kulusevski. I think both are best as a no. 10, behind the strikers. But we could also try to play them between Ronaldo and the RW, but I don't know if that works out. We have a lot of (young) players who can play on different positions, that's great, but it's still important to have "that one" standard formation, but that's just my opinion.</TEXT>
