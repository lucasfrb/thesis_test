    <TEXT>thats very interesting!! omg tysm for sharing. personally, i feel the same way as you. but it sounds like you're experienced. ive tried introducing new witches to tarot and if they have anxiety/paranoia, it tends to stress them out. i feel like this is because they havent yet learned to properly interpret. interpretation is a big part in what i believe to be the basics of any divination practice</TEXT>

    <TEXT>youre the second person to say im gatekeeping. let me reiterate, i am NOT saying she shouldnt have fun with this practice. but she was persistent in learning tarot despite me saying we should start with something like interpretation/visualisation (as you said, bc i believe those are the key components to properly doing divination). not only that, but i tried to approach this with an open mind and thought she was maybe just excited. i politely told her that this isnt something i like to joke about, and, like i said, she didn't care much. i also didnt say she couldnt learn, just not from me</TEXT>

    <TEXT>i only ask bc the length of a taper really depends on how much the person is taking. try to go down by .25mg every 3 months. that sounds like the safest route. i went down by .5-1mg every 3 months for my ativan taper before i was cut off. as long as your mom is getting a consistent prescription there shouldnt be a problem with tapering. good luck. i also recommend CBD oil under the tongue and L-Theanine to help with any symptoms that may come up. your mother should be safe regardless. this is just in case anxiety strikes and she wants to up the dose again. L-Theanine really helped me with my mood and CBD is generally calming. its also okay to smoke (it wont get u high, there is no thc. thc gets you high. you'll just feel more stable), some places like spencers sell cbd vapes for like $15. if you have any other questions feel free to ask me :) i tapered down for a few years from 6mg to 3mg very safely with these tips. its good that you arent stopping cold turkey. your mom is very lucky to have someone looking out for her health. best wishes to you and yours</TEXT>

    <TEXT>honestly? gabapentin is very easy to taper off of (imo). you can always taper after the heaviest wave of PAWS, y'know? i tapered down to 600mg (i was taking 600mg in 2018 for pain, then 1200mg in 2019 for my wd, and now 600mg again). hope gabapentin helps  #128175; cbd oil always helps with my mind flares too</TEXT>

    <TEXT>gabapentin is often given to people in pain management in replacement of opioids. although gabapentin is a narcotic, and it can be addictive if abused, it is generally easy to taper off of. i was doing it by 300mg each month, and i was fine. i know what a wd is like, i wouldve been able to tell. the only reason i stuck to 600mg was because my chronic pain was more apparent at 300mg lol. good luck btw :)</TEXT>

    <TEXT>actually, i experience very similar situations at my work. they know i have memory problems, so some of my managers tell me louder, and more in a more strict tone (which is apparently the cure for amnesia!). its just mean, people really think we're faking something that is seriously difficult to deal with. i was once told by my sister that it only happens when its convenient for me</TEXT>

    <TEXT>what are your symptoms? for example, mine were mainly intrusive thoughts, so antipsychs really helped. depending on what your symptoms are, a different type of medication may very well help you! talk to your psych about your options, i currently take an SNRI as well. it was increased during my wd and it helped w certain symptoms :) edit: sorry! no glasses, didnt see the last part. it sounds like an SNRI would really help. maybe a mood stabilizer? keep in mind these can always be tapered later if no longer needed. im currently lowering my antipsychs since its been over a year</TEXT>

    <TEXT>its probably a slight wd, your body is expecting a steady supply of something you dont have. if it gets too bad you should go to a doctor, but for now i suggest staying hydrated and eating right. try and get all that stuff outta ur system yknow? i always had trouble sleeping through my wd too, so that's normal as well (if u experience that). i highly suggest neurosleep. if you want sumn more natural, chamomile or catnip :)</TEXT>

    <TEXT>shes going through some stuff rn, she hasnt spoken to me since january. she'll only speak to a fragment and my persecutor. imo it aint wrong if youve done enough research because it is VERY difficult to get diagnosed with DID/OSDD. i self diagnosed at around 16 but have had alters since middle school/childhood. i didnt get diagnosed until 20 due to the fear of not being believed by a psych. even after an official diagnosis, my newer NPs/psychs refuse to believe i have something so rare, so it doesnt even matter. you know yourself best. ofc take this with a grain of salt because there ARE people out there who take use it as a personality trait. but, imo, thats super rare and not a reason to avoid self-diagnosing. after i self-diagnosed and started using the term more to define myself, i was able to come to terms with what i had and was able to better communicate w my alts.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>its very normal to not switch when you're first discovering alters, but some people (like myself) have such a good connection with their alts that they can switch out almost on command. i really recommend being as gentle and understand to your alts as possible- after all they were born from trauma, and that isnt always the best way to come into being. i wish you luck. hmu if u have any questions!</TEXT>

    <TEXT>kpin wds are some of the strongest, depending on how long you were taking kpin, it could be a while before it passes. i DO NOT recommend drinking during a wd. i usually recommend thc for strong symptoms, but it sounds like that might be a bit much for you. order a cbd vape if you can- or buy one from spencers or whatever. no thc. theyre great for calming you down. gummies also work. L-Theanine, a vitamin, also helps stabilize mood. i used it when my mood swings were really bad as well as my depression. definitely recommend that. i use gabapentin for pain, but during my wd it was upped. id look into that, it could be beneficial. i would consider tapering down after the symptoms subside tho</TEXT>

    <TEXT>oh no L-Theanine is a type of vitamin is what i meant. you can always order a CBD vape online, thats what i do! gabapentin can be used for wds, yes. especially because it helps you mentally AND physically. i would quarter if you can for a few months, and then half it. so .36- should be okay. 3 months maybe? if you can half that, then id do it for another month or so after. if you CAN do a long taper, i always suggest it. but im aware some people dont have enough to taper properly</TEXT>

    <TEXT>i believe theres a type of identity disorder that doesnt necessarily stem from childhood trauma, so thats something to look into. for now id leave the trauma stuff to the professionals, in terms of questions. just let her know you always have a listening ear. i often times dont see hosts (what your daughter is) introducing their alters all at once. sometimes its in small increments, like "yesterday __ helped me do my homework" "whos __?" go from there. some alters dont have a familial bond to their hosts, despite sharing a body. so they may not see you as their mother, but rather someone else that helps take care of the host. above all else, just listen. dont pry too much, your daughter will tell you everything if she trusts you (and you sound like you're very close with her!) maybe ask some questions about their personality, itll show her that you're genuinely interested and dont see her differently! like what kind of food they like, if they even like food, what r they into, etc :)</TEXT>

    <TEXT>i understand, most of my family aside from my immediate family didnt know. those who did didnt see it as a big deal. on my more rough days they would tell me to get over it. my father never believed i was suffering bc he never saw me when it was active (he came home at night when i was locked in my room in fear of scaring my family). he actually yelled at me and scolded me for being a lazy nobody for not working or going to school during this time. honestly, at the end of the day, those who want to put you as a priority and those who want to understand you will. those who dont want to, simply wont. although my mother is not the best, she turned her ass around when she was already halfway home because i called her from the hospital during a psychotic episode (which have increased since my withdrawal). my point is, effort is not difficult to make. because during these hard times, even a little means a lot. my boyfriend stayed with me during the breakdowns, the ideations, and everything in between. although he was shielded from most of my symtpoms due to me hiding myself from him, he still tried to understand as much as he could. i think effort says a lot</TEXT>

Instead I smoked and ate some dry cereal with blueberries and a glass of milk. Thankfully the pain is not as terrible as it usually is, so I am enjoying the small things while I can. This semester, I am doing the host's course work. So I am also working on an online quiz. Last night, a friend of the host called me a "grandpa wolf", and it made me feel some sort of way...

    <TEXT>first of all, i strongly believe it depends on your outlook. i was introduced to my alters very young, before i even knew what DID was. over the years they've become my family, each with their own life. some even with their own partner. everyone has a role to play, we all help each other. alters are their own people. of course, with that in mind, they also get upset and have their bad moments. and, from my experience, most of them start out not wanting to exist at all. it takes patience and understanding, quite a bit of it. here are some terms to help you better identify the parts of your system, for reference: [http://traumadissociation.com/alters](http://traumadissociation.com/alters) you can always PM me if you have any questions  #9734;</TEXT>

    <TITLE>The Anger of a Persecutor (seeking advice) [CW/TW: SH(?)]</TITLE>
    <DATE>2020-07-01 01:23:18</DATE>
    <TEXT>[There is a mention of sh urges but no description/specifics] Hello. Im The Persecutor of our system. My relationship with The Host began rocky. Though like most persecutors, I ultimately want what is best for The Host. My anger gets the best of me more times than not, because I know that The Host deserves better than what is being handed to us I don't want to hurt the body, but because that is how I handled anger in the past, I have urges I feel nothing but anger nowadays. I am doing my best to support The Host, as the body is extremely ill due to a chronic illness that has flared after years of remission. This, along with mistreatment and degradation from people, have caused me to become a ticking time bomb. I do not know how to handle the injust way The Host has/is being treated I am asking for advice and words of encouragement. Although I am happy to be spending time with The Host (as I am the only one The Host feels safe around), I also want to be helpful. Thank you in advance</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Thank you for your response and encouraging words. I truly appreciate it. You're right, I've never actually looked after myself. I suppose that has always come second to takung care of The Host- but it makes sense. If I am in a better state of mind, then I can better help The Host and the rest of our system. I'll see what I can do moving forward. Again, thank you and be well! -The Persecutor</TEXT>

    <TITLE>how to start eating again</TITLE>
    <DATE>2020-07-02 01:10:20</DATE>
    <TEXT>im not sure whats going on... ive always been better at this. but this relapse of my chrons is different (it came back after many years of remission). the reason its so difficult to eat is because, aside from being afraid to actually eat and induced MORE pain, i spend 70% of my day on the f/cking toilet! agh! when im not, im fatigued as f/ck. i usually dont even want to think about eating because i feel so sick and bloated all the time. of course, that just makes me even more weak and even more sick. when i do eat, it ends badly, more times than not. ive been sticking to yogurt and Gatorade because its quick and i dont have to chew. chewing triggers my nausea so bad. i dont know what to do. i used thc to kickstart my hunger from time to time, but i honestly dont have the money for that right now i dont know if this is me asking for advice or ranting (its both) but if anyone has any tips id be really grateful</TEXT>

You're very right, though. I should use this energy to strive to do better. I want what is best for The Host, so I will be my best for him. Thank you again. Id love to meet her one day if you are ever willing to chat. Have a lovely day! -The Persecutor</TEXT>

    <TEXT>id definitely consider a counselor. i wouldnt view this as a problem though, view this as an opportunity to get better. i understand how you feel. ive socially isolated from my friends because everything has been getting me over the top pissed- the SMALLEST things. my urges are the worst, the only way i can even slightly get rid of them is by physically doing something (like stabbing my desk with a screw driver for example). im currently in therapy, and honestly its helping. we having directly addressed my anger issues, but id like to raise you this- something i learned: you are a human with feelings. strong feelings. this doesnt make you scary, dangerous, or a monster. your anger knows you deserve better theres help out there yo. good luck</TEXT>

    <TEXT>i would say it is weird but only because i sense that you dont know your alters very well. once that changes it will be less lonely. for a year or two it was only my persecutor and i and i never felt lonely. alters, imo, should surface on their own. i say this because many arent ready to become social yet. id encourage you to become closer with the ones that are currently present, maybe this will show your other alters that you are ready to welcome them into your life</TEXT>

    <TEXT>thank you for this response, its all very telling on your perspective. and you're right, i am on antipsychotics but im well aware it probably needs to be at a higher dose. my doctors are literal shit, they keep getting themselves fired. im switching clinics as we speak so that i can get better care. my bf said he was scared and wanted "advice from people with experience". but i dont know what the fuck that means, because these people obviously dont know i have psychosis in the first place. i dont think he even told them. they told him i was abusing him to the extreme- mind you ive NEVER had an ep on him before. ive NEVER said these things before (from what i understand they were extremely scary. i did talk to him about this afterwards, explaining i didnt mean any of it. of course, rather than come to me, he went to his friends a month later. these friends are popular af in one of the communities im in... knowing they see me as someone who would abuse my bf is really horrifying) ive always hid myself in my room by locking myself in there as to not scare anyone. this because ive scared my family before and it was probably the worst feeling ever knowing that i had caused so much trauma within our house by exposing them to how i can be during these episodes. i tried so, so hard not to let anyone know that they even happen in the first place. my bf saw once. we've been dating for almost 2 years. ive done so much for him... i spent the entire month of june showing him how ready i was to get better and seek proper therapy. i thought this was water under the bridge. i just cant believe that out of all the time we dated, he chooses to define me by an episode i had no control over</TEXT>
