    <TITLE>What is suicidal..?</TITLE>
    <DATE>2020-01-14 18:21:10</DATE>
    <TEXT>New to the sub, sorry if it is not the right place to post this. I don #8217;t know if I #8217;m suicidal or not. Recently I #8217;m going through another one of my  #8220;down periods #8221; and I find that I #8217;ve been thinking about suicide a bit too often I guess? It #8217;s not exactly like, I want to do it or I #8217;m planing it, but I #8217;m just thinking about it, and lots of my  #8220;inside conversation #8221; all lead to the point of thinking about killing myself (again, I don #8217;t feel like I #8217;m planning that and I think I won #8217;t), just thinking about it, a lot. When the moments when I #8217;m thinking about it are so desperate and painful, and maybe even terrifying on some level? There are moments when it actually changes into worse feelings but normally it #8217;s not like that. And I feel invalid. So invalid. Like all of my feelings are just me faking them and I just really really hope that someone would actually tell me that it #8217;s all real and say that they know that I #8217;m in pain. Thank you.</TEXT>

    <TITLE>My friend told me that he has DID, and there #8217;s one thing I wanna ask.</TITLE>
    <DATE>2020-03-07 13:45:47</DATE>
    <TEXT>There is this guy in our school that told me he has DID, we weren #8217;t really close, but after he found out that we are both seeing the counselor our school found us, he started talking to me. And a couple of days ago he flat out told me about his DID and I took it quite well (I think), and I #8217;ve been pretty supportive ever since, he comes and talks to me and I #8217;m a total listener in this relationship. I #8217;ve seen like five out of his eleven of his alters and I think rn I choose to believe him. His alters are all different and some of them use different voices and handwriting, which is as I known is the way it #8217;s supposed to be. He also switched a couple of times in front of me and I can clearly see the difference. Most of times, he would actually say that he is dissociating. As I said, I believe him, because I don #8217;t want to dismiss anyone that could be in pain just because what they say might not be true. And really, I rather find out that he doesn #8217;t have this than turning my back on him now. But there is one thing that I just want to ask you guys. From what I know, people with DID experience memory loss and they might not know what their alters did, but that doesn #8217;t seem to be the case with my friend. He is aware of what other alters did, at least mostly, and one time he even said that  #8220;I remember xxx(alter #8217;a name) asked you about.. and that #8217;s what you said... #8221; So I want to ask is this also possible? Tbh, your answer wouldn #8217;t change the way I treat him or if I believe him or not. I want to help. But still I want to know more about this. Thank you for reading. And sorry if there are mistakes cuz English isn #8217;t my first language.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>He has been in therapy but he just told his therapy about his DID a couple days ago so it hasn #8217;t been long, As he describes, he can have conversations with them and alters have access to what #8217;s going on. He said there #8217;s like this big screen inside. Is co-conscious when alters are sort of fronting together and know what #8217;s going on? I #8217;m a bit confused. Also thank you for your clarification!</TEXT>

    <TITLE>Mumbo jumbo and cave update ideas</TITLE>
    <DATE>2020-08-04 07:42:19</DATE>
    <TEXT>A couple of episodes ago mumbo asked in his video what would we what to see in the next mc update, then he also said something about getting excited in his end busting with iskall. I remember he asked if people are saying they want cave update, what could actually be in it and I #8217;ve got an idea! After watching scar #8217;s new video where he mentioned about coloured lighting I thought that could be a perfect addition in the cave update! Mojang can introduce crystals that emit coloured light, or just different coloured fragments you can combine with glow stone or sea lanterns to change the colour. I mean there are many ways they can put the colour part in, there can be cave chambers with different coloured crystals. I #8217;m so excited about this idea!</TEXT>

    <TITLE>Art or Biology, plz help</TITLE>
    <DATE>2020-09-01 17:32:09</DATE>
    <TEXT>I always had an interest in medicine since I was quite young, therefore it was quite obvious that it will be a good idea to take both chemistry and biology as higher level subjects in DP. The problem is that in order to take both sciences, I would have to give up choosing Visual Art, which also has been a very important interest for me. I #8217;ve taken Visual Arts in myp and it was a very fun experience. I do not want to give up this opportunity to take art in DP. Ahhh I just can #8217;t decide. On one side there is biology which is a very important subject for my career and future, but on the other hand, there is art. I know there won #8217;t be another chance for me to do art like in DP, but there is always a way to learn biology on my own. But also ahhhhh My decision just comes down to bio or art, chem is not an concern. And as I read some very good universities just require chem and like an HL math, you don #8217;t have to take bio... Plz help, plz</TEXT>

    <TITLE>I watched some weird nsfw things and I felt really weird and uncomfortable. (16F)</TITLE>
    <DATE>2020-09-11 20:35:48</DATE>
    <TEXT>Tl;DR: I went on a porn website for the first time and watched something medical and suffocation related and I feel very weird, guilty, scared about it, advice? Around last year I kinda realized that I like some medical related things, kinda sexually? It #8217;s a really weird thing I guess but there are so many videos on cpr and defibrillation and all that, in a nsfw way and I was just searching up things online. Before this I #8217;ve never even seen a penis, so when I searched and saw things I felt really weird and uncomfortable with it. I don #8217;t know why but I kinda felt guilty about it? Of course I don #8217;t watch it often or anything, just one every couple of months. Then recently I went on porn hub and saw some very very disturbing things, if you know what I mean, for a person who hasn #8217;t seen a penis a lot in her life, and it was even more uncomfortable and guilty for me. I also watched some suffocation related vids and like I kinda felt this feeling? Idk I #8217;m just kinda scared in general, I don #8217;t even know of what. Is there anything wrong with me for liking that kind of things? I #8217;m just really scared about how I feel and what I like. I #8217;ve been raised quite in a traditional way I guess, so on the topic of sex it #8217;s kinda weird for me. But plz give me some advice.</TEXT>

    <TITLE>Mandarin or Spanish ab initio?</TITLE>
    <DATE>2020-09-12 10:49:50</DATE>
    <TEXT>So Year 1 DP here, and I can #8217;t really decide my group 2. I #8217;m a native mandarin speaker, and my school offers both Spanish and Mandarin ab initio online with Pamoja. If I take mandarin it #8217;s an easy seven and apparently I can still take it somehow even if I #8217;m fluent in mandarin, but obviously it would be a waste of time for me because I still need to attend all the lessons and do the practice. On the other hand, i can take spanish which will require much effort since I #8217;ve never ever learnt it before, other than some phonetics during the summer, but I #8217;ll end up learning something by the end of DP. I actually really really want to learn Spanish but I #8217;m aiming for good universities so I kinda need a seven for my group 2. I #8217;m happy to invest time in this and work hard, so I just wanna ask is it gonna very hard to get a seven? Also pls, any advice is appreciated.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I see what you mean, I wanna study medicine in UK so ya languages wouldn #8217;t matter that much and I #8217;m already taking bio chem and AA math HL, which will take up a serious amount of time and hard core learning. But I kinda wanna challenge myself because I #8217;m quite confident with my language learning skills? I speak three languages fluently cuz of my background, and they say learning a new language gets easier? Idk. so I don #8217;t want to waste time on Mandarin cuz it #8217;s not like I can just take the exam and be done with it. I definitely agree with what you said about the time investment tho, this is the only reason that makes this decision very hard, I will take your advice into account, thank you very much.</TEXT>
