    <TEXT>Then he buys a sharkcard, he uses that money to buy one item, a oppressor, he gets your Gamertag and starts chasing you down in lobbies, you think he's just another random griefer but after awhile his name becomes more familiar, he attacks once more and then you remember, he isn't a random griefer, he's the LvL 24 you wouldn't give 35% to, you two battle and though he holds the advantage he doesn't stand against the experience and versatility of what you can do, his oppressor ends up destroyed and you look at him, not annoyed but disappointed, disappointed he walked down the path of darkness and didn't walk the path of light and prosperity, to put him out of his misery you spawn kill him over and over, never ending until he realises the pain he caused and the destruction he manifested.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Weird one but MNM, as a kid i thought Johnny Nitro was so cool and Melina for a 8 year old kid was the hottest thing I'd have ever seen, But Still Nitro was just so cool to me and his ring work was the coolest thing I'd have ever seen, he just used to bounce around the ring and for a kid that was badass, i stopped watching around 2011- early 2012, i ended up getting back into it after like Wrestlmania 30? I just remember fully watching the summer slam where cena and Lesnar faced off. After that summerslam i got back into it but it was probably Seth Rollins and Dean Ambrose who got me back into it because of their no dq match where Seth curbstomps him onto cement bricks. That's my experience as weird as it is.</TEXT>

The dude is an icon in every sense of the word, even in the twilight of his career he's still one of wrestlings greatest, if not wrestlings greatest.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Suppose so but i wasn't arguing against cesaro, I'm just saying Ziggler has everything in terms of character and ring work to be a top guy, but gets taken away whenever he gets near a world title, i love cesaro, he's like a powerhouse-technician hybrid, but he needs to work on his character, that's why I think they should give him a mid card title, have him defend it for a year and a quarter, than once he's credible enough with his character, have him go for the universal title.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>But nowadays that doesn't apply, at least in WWE, If that was true Ricochet is a Main Eventer for going up against Lesnar once in the main event, to be a main eventer nowadays in WWE you gotta be champion for a long amount of time, have a captivating character or be a legend, Bray Wyatt since he went fiend and dominated everyone he went up against, became a credible main eventer, Ziggler gets short bursts of greatness but they never let it run free, He's fulfilling the role Mr Perfect also Fulfilled, an exceptional Upper Mid-carder with Main event potential, used to groom new talent and make new champions look strong.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Dolph Ziggler as a Kurt Angle TNA type gimmick would be interesting but it doesn't suit him imo, he's too 'pretty' i guess, he's got the look of the cocky heel and his in ring style of a show off + Shawn Michaels rip off suits him way more, i agree he's lost his momentum but he had zero momentum when he won the IC title back in 2017 i think it was? It was the match where he beat Corbin and Bobby Roode, anyways i remember no one expected him to win and no one wanted him to, but once he did everyone went crazy, then he had that whole thing where he 'retired' and left the title in the ring saying no one appreciates his dedication, then WWE ruined what could've been amazing by having him come out number 30 in that years rumble and then having him be eliminated within like 40 seconds, but that little stint proved he could capture momentum out of nowhere when needed, anyways i just want him to have a big title run before he stops for good.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Nah i get all that, a new look maybe but a whole new gimmick would lose why so much people constantly invest in him, dolph being the character he is, a mid card talent constantly forcing himself into main event spots is why people love it, people wanna see Dolph as the showoff hold the title. The reason he was so big during 2014 was because he was unapologetically cocky, him and The Miz do that role so good and to replace that would be a crime in my opinion, A real wrestling machine type character just doesn't sound or look good in my head, it doesn't sound that appealing for Dolph i mean, Dolphs a big draw cause he can get heat and momentum whenever he needs to. WWE constantly fuck him over so I'd like for them to completely invest in him like they did with Drew When he came back, and as the showoff, the gimmick triple H and Vince hate so much would be even better, a new gimmick could revitalise him sure but that implies he needs it, he doesn't need it and won't for a long time, plus when i see his general build he isn't A Kurt angle type body or a even a Randy Orton level body, he's got the light heavyweight body type that really credit's his in ring work and style so to see him bulk and switch for me at least would lose what i and many love about him.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>20 years of mediocrity? The dude literally carried the mid-card during 2009-11,he made the MITB actually valuable, cashed in at probably the best time possible, even after getting sidelined, came back and lifted the mid-card back to it's former glory, gained insane momentum against HHH and the authority, was the central part of probably the most important Rivalry in the company at the time, the miz and Him ended up having some of the greatest matches of the 2010s AND even after all that the only reason he hasn't been pushed is because HHH and Vince don't like his gimmick, whereas everyone else backstage does, so mediocrity certainly isn't the word.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>They tried so hard to make you like and care about Abby AFTER she killed joel, if they had her kill him near the end then they would've at least given us more time to grow with her, like again her Gameplay specifically melee is amazing, she beats the fuck outta every zombie you come across so it's satisfying, but we just don't care for her parts of the game, we waited so long to play as Ellie and Ellie ia treated as this piece of shit bad person, Ellie is constantly doing way worse things, like Neil Druckman or whatever said "we have to make sure they hatw Ellie", i Love Ellie and Dinas relationship, surprisingly one of the very very few good things about the story, i think Dinas an amazing character as she really takes the stand against Ellies dumb decisions, They really try to push that Ellies an Asshole ans Abbys misunderstood, like they betray everything that made Ellie so loveable and likeable and said "fuck it, she's a murderous asshole now", which if they were going the dark route they should've committed cause that ending was disappointing, i get it, she's forgiving Abby but Ellie this entire game has been murdering and butchering fucking armies of people for barley any reason, but chooses to spare Abby? Sure i guess but it's really just bad writing, especially when they make killing in the game so satisfying but also say "don't kill or you're a bad person", i dunno, i think this game ruined so much of what made 1 so great just for shock value, people who disagree can downvote me to oblivion but it doesn't change my opinion and many others.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Damn sounds fun, i saw a few YouTubers play it and was so jealous, i love my xbox but we just don't got any games like that, also those typical "stop bank robber" quests are what i love, people keep saying it's not just a Spiderman game but a game where YOU ARE Spiderman, cause i love Batman and those games but i don't feel like Batman, but with Spiderman it seems like the experience is "you are Spiderman", anyways thanks for your input friend!</TEXT>

Rollo is winning in a fairly tough effort in R1 Ragnar in R2 has a better chance but Rollo is taller and just overall stronger, plus for a dude his size he's extremely agile, so again This round goes to Rollo Out of 10 R1 is about (Rollo)8/10 Round 2 is more like (Rollo) 7/10</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I desperately want homelander to get more psychotic and motivated , cause when he's motivated he straight up accomplishes everything he set out to do, the way he got "revenge" on the 7 was so alpha, he kicked out A-Train, Threatened and Terrified Starlight, outed Maeve as a lesbian and is most definitely playing mind games with her, he only REALLY failed when it came to Stormfront but even so she looked intimidated when he was getting angry, the dude is such a sick and vile villain, i really really hope he just ends up beating the shit outta everyone in The 7 and the boys, just to really drill in how strong and terrifying he ACTUALLY is, probably favourite villain on TV in a long time.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>See, you provided Criticisms, but simply stating "this is dumb and unfun" isn't a criticism, it's people complaining without stating why, and since you wanna go off I'll give you something, it's an opinion, me and a majority of the wrestling community love this game and recognise there's issues, but still love it for what it is, at the end of the day, it's an arcade game, arcade games are meant to be played not in long runs but in short bursts, that's what arcade games are, the gameplay is enjoyable and loved by majority of the consumers, it's a 40 dollar game and has provided a 40 dollar experience to many, but even i know you'll just ignore everything i said so my final thoughts on this are, the gameplay problems are going to be fixed in due time, it just launched, calm, I'm not gonna respond so of you wanna go off once more and say "i won haha" go ahead.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I think Homelander could take this fight by himself or with Maeve and Noir only because in terms of durability, it's stated the American military hit him with everything they could and didn't even dent him, though this is just a statement from the show but if true, that includes Nukes, missiles, Artillery and whatever else the American Military have at their disposal, strength wise we haven't seen him struggle with anything in terms of strength in the show, while that's vague that's all i got cause as of right now i can't think of any of his strength feats, speed wise he himself stated when he was his sons age he broke the sound barrier, assuming he trained at least lightly since then he's faster than the speed of sound no problem, his powerset really revolves around his Laser Eyes and physical durability because he can tank anything anyone throws at him, his laser eyes completely cut through the average human and in the latest episode he cut through a supe terrorist, assuming Compound V slightly advances your strength, durability etc, humans without any heavy armor or protection are done, also in the very first episode his laser eyes cut through a private jet like nothing, honestly bloodlusted this makes it even more unfair cause he isn't gonna jest and be cocky like usual, he's just gonna try murder everyone. Let's be honest, Scarlet Witch at this point in Phase 1 could only throw people around and mind control, while she herself could take care of Deep, someone like Starlight who doesn't need to be close could stop her, Thor and Hulk are the real MVPs for the avengers cause in Phase 1 they were the absolute peak of power, Thor though considerably weaker than Ragnarok thor still hits hard, Thor Could most likely take out deep, starlight and maybe A-Train, But Thor has at least adept mastery over his thunder manipulation in Phase 1 WITH his hammer, but is that enough to take care of the heavy hitters? No, that's why With Hulk, who is undoubtedly the strongest in Phase 1,they have a chance, Hulk stopped that giant worm thing in NY, he took on Abomination, he ripped through Lokis Army like a hot knife in butter, but i have to say, if hulk dies, beating homelander is lost, while Thor could do some cheap hammer stuff where he sticks him to a wall, if that doesn't happen then they don't have the firepower, the reason i haven't mentioned the other avengers is because they aren't strong enough to take down homelander, who is easily their best threat, If Hulk, Scarlet Witch and Thor can't beat or Kill homelander, then no one else on the avengers at that point have a chance. Edit:Forgot to talk about Stormfront but she's the next threat for Hulk and the others if homelander somehow goes down.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>He went through a massive improvement in Ragnarok though, he could actually manipulate thunder at a master level without his hammer, his strength indefinitely increased as he had to rely on himself and not his hammer, who's to say his durability didn't go up as all his other attributes improved?

    <TEXT>His episodes where he's mean and racist are the better parts, not because he's legitimately racist, but because it's that type of dark humor he specialises in, every character i feel fits an archetype for comedy, for example Abed and Troy are the dumb/wholesome type of humor and Jeff of course the dry/sarcastic type, each character appeals to a certain persons taste in comedy and Pearce is that Dark Offensive type, the people who get offended easily are the ones who seem to hate him but love every other character, but that's why he's so good, to really appreciate him as a character and all his jokes you need to have thick skin, only then can you see the excellence in his character.</TEXT>
