    <TEXT>So I've been careening through some bad times lately. I swear my bipolar depression has gotten more intense and I could really use help. Obviously, I should go to a health professional. I don't have a therapist and with the world ending I doubt now is a good time to try shopping around. So I'm stuck with my primary (who I've seen once). I didn't mention I was bipolar when I got on hrt through informed consent. I wanted past the gate. I'd like to see if an antidepressant would help but I don't want to risk losing my transition because some doctor thinks it's my hormones. I also don't know if that's something only a mental health professional can prescribe. my mom's anti doctor (I saw maybe 4 growing up. I probably need some shots I've missed tbh) so I'm a bit inexperienced when it comes to the healthcare system. Any advice would be nice.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>My mom is in this wheelhouse. The loss of a 25 year marriage, the relapse of her first born, and the fact she's got two other kids  gt;25 stuck at home again has destroyed her. She falls into a day of deep depression at least once a week now. She can push it away with exercise for a short time, but usually later that day or tomorrow it's gotten her again. It doesn't stop it, just delay it. She has rods in her back and a failing hip. This day to day fight to force endorphins into her brain is making her miserable in top of everything else. Depression is a complicated topic.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I would watch him very carefully. If you could convince him to get a trigger lock that you hold the key for, that would be ideal. The turnaround mood change is what worries me. I own a handgun. I've put it to my head many times. The only time I really thought I was gonna do it was when I got this strange calm over me. I'd thought about doing it earlier in the day and had accepted it. Luckily my mom was in the other room and she pulled me out of it without really knowing what I was about to do.

    <TEXT>You're welcome, I don't pretend to be an expert but I try. I can't advise staying or leaving. They both have their pros and cons. Don't think you have to stay because he may do it. You're not responsible and you have limits too. If he will let you control the gun, that's a great thing. He seems to want to live but knows he's just gotten a very dangerous toy. He's willing to accept accountability and that's good. So if you choose to stay, keep the key on you, unless you're asleep, then find a good spot to hide it. If you don't sell the gun, I'd actually go to a range once in awhile. Try and get him (and you) to associate it less with this and more with recreation. He probably impulse bought the gun. Change is a trigger for many and, personally, getting a new job is a big source of anxiety. This can drive abnormal behavior. As changes become normalised things can improve. Unfortunately, life gives no guarantees. I really hope things improve for the two of you.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I've had some hard realisations of my own. I wanted to head a large, influential organization or a bleeding edge engineering department. (Basically, have power over influential people or technologies) I got a lot of the education but finding someone to hire a trans woman is hard when most of the field is men. They want people that come off as powerful and I don't. Also, a lot of men won't accept a female manager. I haven't given up my goal but I narrowed my scope. I don't think I'm going to head googles RND department but I may make my own company that builds important things. I'm just gonna have to work harder. You very well could be a goalie. I've seen accountants play 3rd string and successfully compete in that position. (Scott Foster, FTW!) If you're working to stay in the game, you could get damn good at shot blocking. Someone may sign you. If you get old and that never happens, you could kill it at your local co-ed adult games. I have a cis girl friend that plays hockey with men from her community college. She kicks butt too. I hope you get to realize your dream of hoisting the Stanley cup and letting your dress go spinny.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I'm not saying cut her out completely, just don't engage with the homophobia. If she tries to send you another letter like that, tell her that you don't want to have that conversation. You clearly have different beliefs than her. Let her know you're not interested in guilt or Bible verses and that if she tries to do that again, you're going to have to distance yourself. Not necessarily no contact. Let her know you won't open her letters if you feel they'll be filled with homophobia. She'll be forced to call you and it's a bit harder to guilt someone when they can respond in real time. I'm sorry you have to deal with this.</TEXT>

And I'm not a boy. 0/3 Spencer's not just racist, he's a purist. Obvious racists aren't his only supporters. Many hardcore white supremacists don't like his views because he doesn't believe whites are *inherently* better, he just wants every culture to remain separate.

    <TEXT>You can make assumptions off my post history or you can debate. My character and state of mind doesn't change my arguments validity. Richard Spencer is a sizeable threat to modern Democracy. He would have us devolve back into Jim Crowe. I'm not supporting the twit, I'm saying don't just dismiss Spencer as a nobody. Well over a million people have been influenced by him and to deny that is to deny reality. The "OK" symbol is being coopted by white supremacists. Removing it from CoD may prevent it's spread under certain conditions. It's stupid if they just removed it from a cutscene. Assuming it's a gesture you can freely do. It could be something racists start doing when they kill a black character instead of "teabagging". (Also a stupid practice) This catches on and suddenly the conversation happening on Xbox with 8 year olds is, "no, if they're black you do this." I highly doubt 4chan started the gesture takeover. Even if they did, Spencer is definitely the reason it's an issue today.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>No, but since you went ahead and brought up him, he also coopted symbolism. The Swastika is a Hindu religious symbol usually meaning "good luck" but I bet if you saw a person walking down the street wearing that pattern you would look twice. We live in a time where white supremacists are attempting to take common symbols. Removing it from a place they historically shelter themselves (Video Games) is a simple way of slowing the spread.</TEXT>

Hell, pretty sure you picked one of the more common ages people begin that anyways but if they weren't allowed to even start the process until 25 you'd doom every transgender person to a life where they undergo both of their puberties before they can start the one they wanted because *some* people might be wrong. Before you get on my back, yes, I think under 18 should have additional rules but adults should be allowed to inform themselves and consent. Insurance is already a big enough pain to deal with.

If I were in a different county I could get a concealed carry but because king county is closed I can't. If you can fingerprint my brother to put him in jail, you can fingerprint me to run my background. I'll wear a mask. Also, in the legislation, it specifically says, "a political subdivision of the state shall not modify the requirements of this section or chapter" It seems that is a lie. Anyways, rant over.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>TW: I'm a vulgar person. The whole damn month and September too. I hate my mom asking me what I want to do for it every year. Like I can respond with anything. I really want a party. With friends. There's the fucking caveat. Cake is easy. Friends are impossible when you've moved across the damn country your entire childhood. How can I say that the only thing I want is friends? To be in a group and not become the third wheel that gets dumped off at some point. There's no store for that. Im so alone. It's been years since I've had anyone even give a shit about me and my birthday is a rude reminder every year. Getting that happy birthday text from my sister sucks. Scrolling up four messages and seeing the same message from last year and the year before that is depressing as hell. Every year I start making plans to kill myself but I never do it. I don't want to be another year older. Have to embrace another year of failure. Another year of anxiety about life and the obviously worsening global climate, both literal climate and political. I don't see anybody wanting to be with me and that's honestly a good thing. I'm a 25 year old pessimistic shut-in that cuts herself. Darwin has a theory about me.</TEXT>

Also, I lived in two southern states for 9 years. There's actually quite a few people in the south that aren't obsessed with guns. It's not "take their guns" it's, "make it harder for a 20 yo pissed off kid with nothing to lose to get an assault rifle." But sure, I'm advocating for the removal of the second amendment, not common sense gun legislation. Everybody's an extremist in assumption land.</TEXT>

Just because you don't believe America has the capability to change, doesn't mean everyone does. Australia has *less* guns and *less* gun deaths. By a huge margin. So does New Zealand.

    <TEXT>I'm not saying ban guns. Find where I said that (that wasn't sarcastic). I've pointed this out twice now. I said make them less prolific. Less easy to attain. Perhaps a license to carry one, like driving. Your idea that "if someone comes at me with a knife, I'll get my gun" is a lot less reasonable when you realize most knife attackers will be in range before you know they've got a knife. And all you've done by proliferating firearms is make that knife attacker more likely to come at you with a gun instead. Also, it's harder for a kid to steal your knife and kill five classmates. Or an unarmed person to come up behind you and suddenly be very much armed. Yet again, if it's not perfect solution, it's not acceptable you. Not even worth considering even if you can see other people utilizing the solution effectively. Our constitution used to say women couldn't vote and alcohol was illegal. We changed that. Perhaps allowing militia groups isn't the best idea. Australia is an equivalent to America. Making the assumption that we can't do what they did because we have more people is not logical. Why can California institute large societal changes so much quicker than the rural states then? If you try to say "we have laws that stop that" again, I'll simply point out the capacity for change, so get another argument.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I just said this. Capacity. For. Change. You need a license to practice law. It's just having an argument but you need to pass a test to do it professionally. Not every right is guaranteed without restriction. Parade organizers need licenses to organize. So do protesters in many places. Are you married? How was the line getting your marriage license. You need building permits to construct on your own land. Guns aren't special. They're just like everything else, an object or action that can be reasonably regulated.</TEXT>
