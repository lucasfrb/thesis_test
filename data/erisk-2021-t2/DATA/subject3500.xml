    <TITLE>Russian Mafia anyone?</TITLE>
    <DATE>2020-06-22 17:53:45</DATE>
    <TEXT>I used to be a member of a large group called the Russian Mafia. I probably shouldn't post this because the members hate me and will most likely get me kicked off of Reddit, so to those people who want to do that, can you leave the drama behind already? Anyway, just wanted to know if any member or ex-members were here.</TEXT>

    <TITLE>I was kicked</TITLE>
    <DATE>2020-06-23 04:03:49</DATE>
    <TEXT>I had two accounts ( i know I'm not supposed to but I'll explain) you see, I used to be on Quotev and made many friends on there, but I ended up getting involved with bad people who turned on me, mass reported me and got me kicked off. I was panicking for a way to gain contact with all my online friends ( they thought i had killed myself) and needed a way to tell them I was ok, so I went on Flight Rising, where all my friends were. I had all my friends added on that account, but decided to change my account a few weeks later. I made a new account and had gotten new dragons and everything, but occasionally I went back on my first account because some friends from my first account didn't "friend" me on my second account, also, I had three very personal and important dragons there who meant very much to me. Apparently having two accounts is against the rules ( I had no idea because when I tried to see the terms of services link when i first made both of my accounts, the link wasn't working) so both of my accounts were taken and now my friends don't know what happened to me and i have no other way to talk to them since they only used Flight Rising and Quotev and i can't use either now.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Haven't been happy in almost two years. My parents just think im being sad. My friends are weary around me because they know how i can be. Most people I find myself around are manipulative and toxic. I turned to the internet as a final attempt to save myself, and...most people I've met were just as bad as real life. I'm the world's toy to put it bluntly. I'm most peoples punching bag. Most people i know either like me ( in a friendship way or actually like LIKE me) because of my looks, yet the other people i know hate me for them, nobody ever cares about my personality. I feel so stupid and used. Well, I cant be hurt anymore if im gone. I wrote my note already. Is it too late for me though? I feel like a lost cause.</TEXT>

    <TITLE>Is this goodbye?</TITLE>
    <DATE>2020-06-23 21:42:06</DATE>
    <TEXT>Most of my friends are/were toxic and manipulative, my other friends don't care about my problems, most people who like me only like my looks/body, most people bully me, my family doesn't care, my family only cares about money and owning and controlling me. Everyone only ever sees the negative. Everyone tells me to " just stop being sad" I was bullied my whole life and nobody ever cares. I went to the internet as a last resort, to take my mind off of cutting and starving, I thought I made friends, but they were just as toxic and manipulative. I thought I had a good girlfriend who cared about me but she manipulated me and made me feel worse about myself before dumping me and leaving me for dead, she turned my "friends" against me and I lost almost everything and anything. I was mass reported and banned off of Quotev as a result. I went to see the few friends I had on Flight Rising. I got together with my oldest friend and we were happy. Then i was banned there because I had two accounts ( i was in the process of changing accounts) now I'm just as stressed, I'm scared my girlfriend will khs. I am stuck with my family who only ever yell at me. My mom is here just screaming at me and whining. None of my friends want to/can talk to me, I'm just alone with my thoughts. I've been the world's toy for far too long and I'm done. I'm so done, so, I guess this is goodbye. I know the over 1000 people who hate me will be glad I'm dead. I know my toxic friends, my bullies, my family, my ex will all pull a " it's not my fault!" But deep down, they're the root of it. They're the sprouts that instead of boosting me up into a blossoming person, they brought me down, and I know by ending it I'll be brought down even further, but its the only way to end this torture. The 1000 people who hate me can deny it all they want, but they can live life knowing they hurt me so much they indirectly killed me. My parents will be able to not worry about paying for food, school supplies, clothes, and art supplies for me, not that they did it anyway. They'll be able to get rid of my cat ( my only emotional support) and will probably give all my stuff to my brother or throw it away. So yeah...</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Name: False Gender: female Appearance: lavenderish pale brown lioness with blue eyes and a strange lavenderish brown mane Personality: tomboyish, wild, silly, prideful, outgoing, stubborn, possessive, shorttempered Pride: Flight Plateau ( the one she was born in), Sunkissed Valley ( Dustmane's pride), now prideless Father: Jollymane Mother: Swiftrace Sister: Shocktooth Half brothers ( fathers side): Shadow, Bustmane, Wiltmane Half brother ( mothers side): Glowmane Half sister ( mothers side): Broadstrike (Future) mate: Jumper (Future) cubs: Lightning, Mask, Windpounce Backstory: she was born alongside her sister, and everyone believed she was a normal female. She wasn't named and was meant to get her name after her assessment. She grew up looking up to her older siblings, Broadstroke and Glow, her mother's children with the previous mane. She also had an older litter of half brothers, the sons of her father and the hunt chief. She grew up but as she got older, she started growing a mane. Her mother, older siblings, father, and friends started to distance themselves from her. She only had two lions to comfort her, her brother shadow, who was also an outcast for being a strange black lion, and her littermate. When it was time for her and her sister to get their ceremonies, Shocktooth got hers no problem, but instead of getting a normal name for her abilities, she was given a name like a males, false, after her "false" mane. However, when she became two years, she wasn't banished like her brothers were. She was welcome to stay, and her pride used her as protection to scare off no-manes by letting them think there were more males than there actually were. When her father was eventually killed and a new male took over, he never took interest in her and remained cold to her. The entire pride did not like her and False ending up more often than not sneaking out to see her brother Shadow. On her way one day, she met a lone serval, by the name of Jumper( named by humans). False felt herself fall for the serval, but felt wrong about it. She wasn't sure if she loved him or wanted to eat him. She pushed her feelings away and ended up running away from her pride and joined another one, where she had a litter of cubs with a male by the name of Dustmane, who didnt care how she looked. But she didn't love Dustmane. Eventually, False decided to take her chances and she left the new pride and met up with Jumper again, and feelings resparked between them. They both realized they were in love and stayed together, raising False's cubs without a pride. So thats my oc. What do y'all think?</TEXT>

    <TITLE>AITA for getting mad that my younger brother got a phone before me</TITLE>
    <DATE>2020-06-25 22:24:53</DATE>
    <TEXT>This happened a year ago ( I have a phone now) when my brother was 5. My parents get new phones about every 1-5 years. My dad kept one of his phones and gave it to my 5 year old brother to play games on ( the phone didn't have internet and you couldn't call/text on it) I was MAD. I told my dad that he shouldn't have given a phone to my brother when I'm older. Plus, at the time I was going to a school in a really shady area ( as in people were selling drugs left and right and kids were hooking up in the restrooms) and that i NEEDED a phone because I didn't feel safe at that school. ( there was even a situation where I needed to flee from the classroom and couldn't call my mom because I didn't have a phone, but that happened after the events, but still, I needed a phone) my mom and dad both yelled at me telling me shut up, that my brothers phone didn't even have internet, he was just using it for games. I said how he was using a phone for his reasons and I wanted a phone for my reasons and it still wasn't fair, that its still a phone nonetheless. They never listened and my brother played with the phone the whole time until he got bored of it the following year. I got a phone later that year for my birthday and my brother got a trampoline on his birthday. I've always believed that they liked my brother more and I told this story to my grandma and she agreed with me. She knew how dangerous my school was and agreed that I needed a phone. So reddit, am I the asshole for getting upset that my toddler brother got a phone before me?</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I got in my first ever relationship about a month ago, she ended up being toxic. She'd tell me the experiences I went through were nothing, yell at me for being depressed, force me to give her information then blackmail me with it, threatened multiple times to give out my information, told me info that made me scared of leaving her, and made me do things I didn't want to do. She told me if I ever died she'd kill herself along with me, then she left me for dead. Later I got with another girl, who was my old friend. We were so happy, then i lost contact with her a few days ago. She hasn't checked the messaged ive sent her. She has no idea. I was living for her. I thought she cared. I was wrong. Why am I even here?</TEXT>

    <TEXT>My first ever character was made when I was about...9ish years old. When I first got into furry stuff and first started cosplaying. You see, I has a fox lps toy that i loved. I decided to customize it and I painted it white with pink and silver accents. Since then I've done drawings of her, given her multiple names ( I'm very indecisive) as of now she doesn't have a permanent name but I call her Demi, based off the fact that she coincidentally is the colors of the demi girl flag. So if somebody has any name ideas or wants to talk about furry stuff, feel free to talk to me about it, ive been in the fandom for YEARS.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Not to be rude, but thats kinda offensive. I know several non-binary people and all of us constantly hear that our entire lives. Just because it wasn't your identity doesn't mean it's not ours. It would never be a phase because do you think me and several people choose to be this way, so that we can hear that our kind is condemned to hell? To hear that god doesnt love us everyday? No, we will not bring hell on ourselves for a "trend" it is who we are and we are all out and proud now because before it was never acceptable. There is more than two genders. God may have made two, but he made us non-binary, he made us demi, he made us trans. It's who we are.</TEXT>

I've found ways to make myself pleased with my body that I think may help you. First off, don't think of your periods as a bad thing, I think of it as a way of god ( or whatever you believe in or just straight up nature/life, you know what I mean) telling you you're not pregnant, that there's nothing to worry about. ( I've always made a joke that I get a period because mother nature don't have my phone number to just text me that I'm not pregnant) don't think of your breasts as to feed children, think of them to be proud, to go out on the streets and be proud to visually show " I'm a woman) and if you don't want to show them off, you can wear oversized shirts or hoodies. Don't think of your hips and curves as to give birth to children, think of them as a natural way to fit your clothes. Hope I've helped plenty  lt;3</TEXT>

    <TITLE>AITA for getting mad at curious boys twice?</TITLE>
    <DATE>2020-07-01 07:24:16</DATE>
    <TEXT>Ok, so I'm a female, which means I have a time of the month, so at school I carry around a purse to hold my stuff for that time. At my old school I rode the bus to and from school, and on the bus there was a boy we'll call D. D was a very rebellious and annoying kid. Me and most of my friends didn't like him. So one day I was sitting on the bus, I had my backpack, lunchbox, purse, all that stuff on the chair, when my friend started panicking over something ( i can't remember) and her seat was just a few seats away from mine, so i quickly jump over to help her out, leaving my stuff on my seat. so I'm sitting there, helping her, when I hear a bunch of laughing and screaming coming from where I was sitting. I rush back over there to find my group of guy friends in shock, and I find that D had completely taken everything out from my lunchbox and more importantly, my purse! I went pale. The older kids from two grades above me ( who actually hated me) all came running up to see what happened, and the two older girls BLEW UP on D. One, who absolutely hated my guts, grabbed all my stuff and put it back in my lunchbox and purse and handed my stuff back to me and told me to put it next to her things in the back of the bus while the other girl shouted insults and cussed D out. My guy friends stopped talking to him for the rest of the bus ride home and kept whispering to each other about how fucked up the dude was. I was still pissed so as I grab my stuff I scream at him " You're a fucking asshole [D] i hope you know that!" Before walking to the back of the bus and just sat with my stuff completely silent for the rest of the ride. When I got home I told my mom and she was livid. She called my dean and yelled at him about D's behavior. The second time was after I moved schools, I still brought around a purse, but this one I wore on my at all seconds of the day, no matter where i was . so one day we're coming back to class from lunch, and I went to the restroom, as I'm walking back, a boy from my class cornered me, saying " show us whats in your purse! I wanna see your purse! Let me see whats in it!" As he reaches from the purse. All I could think about was about what happened last year and I went into defense mode. I threw my purse behind me and away from him. That didnt stop him and he kept walking closer until I was leaning up against the wall. I got real mad real quick. I said in the deepest, scariest voice I didnt even know I could do, and said " get.the.hell.away.from.me." and I lifted my hand ( i have very long nails that always break skin) and put my hand in a claw like stance. The dude jumped back a bit and i just calmly walked away and back into line, as my teacher was coming back to class. But ever since those two events, especially the second one, I've felt like an asshole for what i did, so reddit, am I the asshole?</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I told her that I was cornered for it , didnt tell her that I basically threatened him, mostly because im not allowed to cuss ( however she has said im allowed to when defending myself but my mom is confusing.) Also, the boy knew what was in my purse, he made several comments about it, he just wanted to see so he could "have the right" to make fun of me. Most other girls there haven't had the need to have a purse yet or just take their backpacks with them everywhere so me having a purse is kinda weird to them</TEXT>

I'm a waste of potential to my friends. I'm worthless. Im everyones punching bag, the only reason people still want me is for my looks and their own wants. They want me, but they don't want me for who I am, I've went through enough experiences to know that. Why am I still suffering? Why can't my misery end?</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Mother, the name I've given you now because I refuse to call you " Mom" or "Mommy" because you're not nurturing and caring enough. Mother, the face of the woman I feel I should love, but all I can think is all the times you'd make me take a belt or a shoe to the ass after a shower, still dripping wet, or the times you've hit me so hard in the morning that I'd walk to school with bruises across my arms, legs, face, and torso, of course that was apparently normal, so nobody spoke up about it. Mother, the woman who would yell at me saying shed still whoop my ass even though I was taller and bigger than her, and she stayed true to her word. Mother, the woman who didn't let me go to a friend's house because she was "worried" when she just kept me home so she could yell at me about everything wrong in her life. Mother, the woman who'd go on a rampage for seeing a crumb on the ground when I had been constantly cleaning. Mother, the woman who put me through hell when I was on my period and made the world stop and focus on her when she had hers. Mother, the woman who'd lie to her family to cover up the fact that i hadn't eaten all day and yell at me for it. Mother, the woman who threatened to chop up my cat. Mother, the woman who shoves it in my face that she's getting rid of my cat, when she knows that my cat is my only emotional support. Mother, that woman I'm supposed to come to for everything, but I'm too scared to so I run to my dad but she yells at me for going to him. Mother, the woman who yells at me for not responding her yelling at me, yet yells at me for being a "smartass" when I do respond. Mother, who says I'm talking back when I finally stand up for myself once in a blue moon. Mother, the one who wants a baby when she doesn't even like the two kids she does have and complains about money problems and the pets. Mother, the woman who turns my family against me by making me the bad guy. Mother, the woman who I doubt will care when I'm dead. Mother, the woman who'll move on in a week, have a new baby, get rid of my cat, sell all my stories, songs, art. Mother, the woman i thought would've cared.</TEXT>

While my parents didnt say that, I get what you mean, i get that you hate it. ( I'm about to say something kinda religious, if your not religious, then I'm sincerely sorry, its the only thing I can't think of) your parents can go to hell, they sound horrible to not believe their own child.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>So there is a song that everytime i hear it I start bawling, and it's Riptide. It used to be my favorite time. When my and my now Ex talked for the first time she was so excited to sing for me, and this was one of the songs she sang. Its the song that made me start to fall for her when she sang it. She ended up being a bad person for me to be around and she broke up with me, and when I hear this song I think of all the times she hurt me and the few good times we had. I found somebody way better than her, and when I got over her, I wrote a diss rap about her, so everytime I hear Riptide I hum my diss rap to keep myself from crying because it still kinda hurts.</TEXT>

Any and every reason to cut or die seems valid, everything positive thrown and you is pushed aside, and you treat the evil and hurtful things like a crowned heir, but that heir is evil, but you're forced to do it anyway. A voice creeps to you telling you everything you hate, everything negative you've heard. And that voice makes it valid.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Another attempt. Doubt I'll succeed, but maybe. Mother just yelled at me again, once again, and she'll regret her last words she said to me. If Zephyr sees this, remember that I love you, and you've made me the happiest girl ever. If my father sees this, goodbye daddy, I hope you'll be able to move on, you made all my life the best, remember how much I love you. If my mom sees this, I hope you still love me, i hope you're not ashamed of me, and I hope you and the rest of the family won't have any problems when I'm gone. As for the many bullies, fake friends, and bad groups I've been with, I hope you've seen what your actions have done, i hope you learn, and I hope you become better people. I know way to many people who'll be happy I'm gone. Maybe this is goodbye, I hope it is. Edit: yes I did fail sadly, goddamnit.</TEXT>

    <TITLE>AITA for causing an emotional drift with my mom?</TITLE>
    <DATE>2020-07-03 22:06:02</DATE>
    <TEXT>I know the title doesnt sound good, but I'll explain. So yesterday i made a post about my mom and people have been asking me about it, so here you go. Me and my mom used to have an awesome relationship up until age 10, when we moved back to my home country. I've been more sad/mad since bullying, abuse, assaults, puberty, and body dismorphia. My mom has always been a very bipolar person, but because I'm more sad/mad more often, me and her constantly fight. So my mom says a lot of things that don't sit well with me. She tries to restrict a lot of things from me and always gets her family to back her up. Because we fight often and because she always yells at me, I always ask to go to friends houses or hang out at a public place with them, and she always says no. I needed a phone because i was in a school where people would hook up during class and do illegal drugs, she said no, which LITERALLY ONCE PUT ME IN DANGER. She yells at me for constantly laying on the couch when I do it because my body is always in pain one way or another, she always makes me do extra work when I'm on my period or I'm sick but when she is the whole world has to stop for her. She doesn't let me watch a lot of things ( including some educational videos) because they're either slightly inappropriate or have cuss words even though its perfectly fine for me to hear her cuss out people or talk about sex in front of me. All of these things have just made me ball up a lot of feelings, emotions, and me and my mom lash out at each other because we're so fed up with each other. My whole family treats me like a little kid and make it seem like I'm in the wrong everytime and I always have to be the one to apologise and they make me feel shit about myself. So reddit, am I the asshole for constantly getting mad at my mom and causing an emotional drift? Also, for a bigger explanation on how much she's hurt me, check out my other post about her</TEXT>

I have a lot of LQBTQ+ friends ( i have straight friends too, no bias) and she talks about them, saying they are too young, that they dont know what their doing and will change their mind and it pisses me off so much.

    <TEXT>Today, the 4th of July, a month ago, I had decided that i would end it all. Today is the day, I'm starting to rethink it, I still want to...but now I'm not so sure. The blue whale challenge is coming back around. I mean, I wouldn't do it, but do i want to live to be used? Do I want to live when 1000 people that I know hate me and plenty more I don't know, and just living will make even more hate me. I just don't wanna leave because I'm scared I'll go to hell. But is that durable? Is there even anything after this? Maybe I'll be reborn and get to start again. Id like that very much.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>The Readyrojo ( the name created from the Spanish word redrojo, which means runt, and ready, for their speed) is a deerlike creature that roams on the beach. They're spotted and most have either piebaldism or vitiligo. They can go in either water or land. Under water they only have their front legs and are like mermaids in the sense that their back legs have been replaced with a tail ( which looks like a giant crab claw) when on land the tail opens up to reveal two back legs, so that they can walk around like a normal animal. They have very earthy colors, and are only found in shades of black, brown, white, and beige. They eat food like kelp, algae, coral, shrimp, clams, oysters, and crawfish. Hit me up if you have any questions about them and when I finish the art I'm doing right now, I'll show y'all how they look</TEXT>

    <TEXT>No no, im not asexual, asexual is something else. Asexual is a person who doesn't find the appeal in sex, who has no desires for it. Agender is similar but instead of refusing sex, theyre refusing gender. Basically some days, I want to be a female, other days I might want to be agender, some days I may want to be nonbinary. It all depends</TEXT>

    <TITLE>Was I assaulted?</TITLE>
    <DATE>2020-07-07 02:04:54</DATE>
    <TEXT>Was gonna post this on r/rapecounseling but i think this may be better. So I had an ex tell me that I wasnt and that i was overdramatic and it really made me start thinking if i was wrong, I've had friends tell me that i probably was asking for it and if I wasnt then I deserved it. I had people tell me that I seduced him so i just want to post to see what people think once and for all. So this happened when I was 11(6th grade). I was at a school that was in a bad area, as in kids were hooking up in the middle of class periods, kids were selling each other illegal drugs, kids were drawing literal porn. It was just insane. So i was in chess class, and it was the last day of the semester, so we were watching a movie and there were more kids than there were seats, so i chose to sit in the front, right in front of the movie, but under the front desk where my friend was sitting. Then a 7th grade boy (age 13) came and sat next to me, under the next over desk, where his friend was sitting. I had no problem with it and scooted over for him to sit. He started getting flirty immediately. I was uncomfortable but I thought it was fine, he was just playing around, right? So he continues, but then he starts saying things like " Imma go to the restroom" before winking at me. Soon he started getting touchy. He'd hug me and get all touchy on my boobs. He'd stroke my thigh and get dangerously close to my crotch. Eventually he told me get up, so i did, i got on my knees because i thought he was gonna scoot away, but then I heard him whisper in my ear "sit back down now" before he pulled me down, and to my horror realized he stuck his hand up my behind. I felt sick to my stomach, and instead of going into fight or flight, i froze. He moved me around and, while I never wanted him to, I didn't say no, because I was frozen. He adjusted me so he was sitting behind me, where he'd thrust behind me. He moved right back next to me when he was done, and he said " stay still" and I did, because he'd give me the most threatening look and raise his hand and I was scared. He then pulled down my pants and put his hand in me. I felt disgusted with myself and finally grabbed the strength to pull his hand away. But he got mad. He grabbed my hand and forced me to give him a hand job for the rest of the class. In the next class period I panicked and told my "friends" who laughed at me, saying i was a whore, and that I was probably asking for it and that i deserved it. I've been really shakey and nervous since all that happened and freak out when people get to close. Some people tell me i was full on raped, others say he was just playing. Some say i deserved it or seduced him. So reddit, was I assaulted? Edit: I forgot to mention that towards the end of class he grabbed my wrists really tight and drag me to the restroom for what he said was "Real fun" but I gained enough strength to pull away at that point. He tried again after class, but I just ran to my next class as fast as I could.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>ok, thanks, I really needed a clear answer. But yeah, my "friends" were very toxic and one of them, the one who was sitting directly above me and knew what happened, tried to use the fact that I "let him" and " gave him a hand job" as evidence that I wanted it or that I did seduce him.

I have to shut everything and everyone out because they all blame me and at this point I have nothing to live for. I'll probably be writing my goodbyes on r/suicidewatch, not like anyone will care, everytime I fail. I'll pray I won't. I'm sure the guy who did it is pleased with his work. I bet he's pleased with how much he fucked me up. But i know who will be pleased. My ex, who repeatedly told me I wasn't, that she "almost was" that she had it worse. I know all my "friends" will, the ones who said i deserved it, the ones who called me a whore. I doubt y'all will care, I'm just a random attention whore on the internet</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I mean, i do post things, and all of them are true (wow I sound like a bratty kid lol) but i post AMA's about them because I want to teach people. For example, I posted an AMA about me being an honorary gang member, ex online cult member, and the leader of another online cult ( if you're confused feel free to ask about it) because I wanted to teach people the dangers of it and how to avoid/deal with it if they are ever in a similar situation. I also did a post talking about writing chapter books at such a young age because I want to help people who want to start writing. Hope thats able to clear out some things, but I wont deny that there are a ton of kids acting like they got some rare disease/disorder and I'm fucking sick of it.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I will 100% admit that they were never full on cults, I'm calling them what they called themselves. They referred to themselves as cults and for a lack of a better word thats what I'm calling them. But yes, i was a member of a gang. I was an honorary member of the Bloods gang, a large American gang. When I was smaller my friends grew up in entire families that were involved in Bloods and after I got close to those friends, their parents said they'd make me an honorary member and when I'd grow up they'd make me a full member of the Bloods gang, but when I changed schools I lost all contact. So yeah, I was an honorary gang member. The online "cult" did have their own specific beliefs and did want us to have our allegiance to them.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Ok, this isnt strange, more so its just cruel. So I have an on and off problem with being hella anorexic, as well as I have problems (that stem from things happening to me) where I just can't eat when there is somebody yelling or somebody just being generally negative ( which is what my mom loves to do) so we were all eating together and my mom's yelling and being all pissy as normal so I get upset because at the time I was only eating once a day and I couldn't even eat at all that day because she's yelling. So I put my food in the fridge to eat later and go upstairs. I'm on the verge of a panic attack because of my moms yelling and she knew I go on my phone to escape a panic attack, so as a punishment for not being "greatful" and "appreciative" for the food, she locks my phone (parent lock, she can lock it whenever she feels like it) and, knowing I'm now having an unavoidable panic attack, yells at me to come downstairs and clean up the house, while yelling at me for crying.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I haven't been diagnosed with anything but it makes it so much harder. I've been cutting for two years, I've been suicidal for a year and a half, I've lost track of how many times I've come close or attempted to kill myself in the past month alone. I have panic attacks at least 3 times a day. I starve myself, to the point of where I'll buy a 12 count of chicken nuggets yet only eat 4 a day and that'll be all I eat! I always feel weak, I'm always in pain, I always have a headache, I'm always taking medicine. I feel like at this point my own family doesn't love me. I feel like my mom's punching bag for her to lash out at when shes mad (she's literally always mad, I'm not fucking joking) I feel like nobody will miss me when I'm gone. I crave death and all i want is for it to be over. All my parents ever say is that other people had it worse, that i have no reason to still be upset over all the things thats happened to me. But they only know part of the problem. They scream at me when they suspect things so i never get to tell them. " if you cut yourself i swear to god I'll beat your ass" " I swear to god ______ if you starve yourself." " You better not ever have suicide thoughts! Thats the devil getting into your mind!" " you better not let anyone touch you inappropriately!" So I don't tell them, so they don't know the extent of my suffering. They don't know i was assaulted at 11, they don't know that I was groomed at 11 and again at 12! They don't know that i was cyberbullied, they don't know I was in a bad relationship, they dont know that i was abused by relationships, friends, schoolmates, because they dont let me tell them! I was to die but they dont get it! They dont understand that they made my life worse by making me change schools every few years! I've gone through double the amount of schools my own mother has yet both my parents tell me they would've loved to get to move around that much at my age and there wrong! I have such separation anxiety from it to wear I have panic attacks for a school break or a fucking single day we don't have school! I've been cutting with a rusty exactoknife for two years because I literally could give less of a shit about myself. I have the worst relationship with my parents because if it wasn't for them, I would've never been bullied, i would've never been put through hell, if it wasn't for my parents, I'd be a normal and happy person but i fucking cant be and people fucking want me dead because of my mental health!</TEXT>

    <TITLE>A letter to my older self if I ever live long enough to see it</TITLE>
    <DATE>2020-07-12 09:37:32</DATE>
    <TEXT>Hey, not sure you/I will ever see this, considering, my life may end very soon. I'll read this again when i graduate, even though that'll be years from now. Life has been hard, you know it. Life has always been hard. But, if you survive, it shows thats you're strong. Remember the time when you sat at that desk, holding a knife in your hand, ready to end it all, but your cat was there. Remember when she knocked the knife out of your hand and to the floor and cuddled up to you, rubbing her nose to your face to wipe your tears. Remember the times when you were self harming and listening to music and baby dont cut came on and you dropped your blade and started bawling, thinking how your then girlfriend would react if your dead. Remember the day that she broke up with you, how she turned everyone you thought loved you against you, remember how she spread lies about you, remember how that night you grabbed the knife again to try to kill yourself, but you couldn't go through with it, so you ended up just self harming instead, you marked up your entire arm that day. Remember the tears you shed as you felt trapped and forced to say things you never would ever want to say, after all, you were just a kid. Remember when you were forced to tell her secrets and had a panic attack when she threatened to tell them to everyone. Remember the fear and pain you went through when you were assaulted at age 11. Remember when you were groomed by a high schooler at age 11. Remember the time your "friends" said you deserved to be assaulted, they called your a whore, they called you a slut, they said you were asking for it. Remember the literal years of torment over having dark arm hair, which is part of your culture, your race, how its something you cant control. Remember when you begged your parents for years to let you get rid of it, but they said no, because them believing their stupid theories were more important then your mental health, than you getting bullied for every single year at school. Remember how you'd cut and starve yourself at age 11. Remember how you'd give away your lunch because you "weren't hungry" even though you hadn't eaten since yesterday's breakfast. Remember when you came to a new school, and how your friend threw away all your blades and made sure you ate everyday because she was worried sick about you. Remember when in choir you were punished and not allowed to do what other kids do, not because you were actually being bad, but because you were standing weird, which was because your knee had twisted again. Remember when you fantasied about shooting or hanging yourself. Remember all the times your parents yelled at you about how they were getting rid of your cat when they knew she was your only emotional support. Remember when they turned you into the bad guy for not wanting to move again because you already changed schools more times than they did by the time you were 12. Remember how much separation anxiety you had from moving schools almost every two years. Remember all the nights you stayed up until 5 because you didn't want to have another nightmare. Remember how every night when you tried to talk to your dad about your depression, he told you how others were having it worse and i didn't have a good reason to still be "depressed". If you're still alive. Look at all you went through. Think about how more there is to come. Its your choice to fight the battle or not. But I doubt you'll ever read this, because you'll never exist, because I'll probably never live until age 18.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Part of a poem speech I made that i turned into a part of my suicide letter. " Sing my songs when my voice is silenced Read my poems, I can't rhyme when I'm dead Publish my stories, when I'm in the grave Tell my speeches, maybe they'll listen when im dead" But I know nobody will. I know when I'm gone I'll be hated in my family because they've gone through so much lost and I would've " hurt them more" I know my mom will victimize herself when shes the thing that keeps me from getting any better. My ex "friends" will think good riddance and will probably act all sad or spread more rumors about me. My ex girlfriend will keep playing the victim card and will act like it was karma punishing me for "hurting her" when shes one of the main reasons I'll be dead. The groups I was in will celebrate, and I wouldn't be surprised if one of them wrote it down as some sort of achievement or write about it in their "wiki" my parents will get rid of my cat, when they knew she's the thing that kept me alive up until then. They'll throw away my phone and computer, knowing every song, every chapter book, every poem, every speech, is in there, those were my only achievements. They'll sell all my valuables to save up for another child. I'll be forgotten. I'll just be the dead faggot. Nobody will remember me, nobody will care. I'll go to hell and that's it, nothing after that.</TEXT>

    <TITLE>Another day of holding myself back from suicide.</TITLE>
    <DATE>2020-07-14 05:02:16</DATE>
    <TEXT>You read the title correctly. 5 minutes ago I almost ended it all, and now I kinda regret, but I kinda really don't. I was cleaning out my cats litter and went to the garage to throw it away, and while in there, saw a sharp tool (Idk what its called, its my dad's) and held it up. I rubbed it to my wrists (not enough to cut, just barely touching my skin) and just stood there, fantasizing about me slitting my wrists and ending it all. But i didn't, I don't even know why, but I stopped myself right before I slashed my wrists. I put the tool away and walked back into the house where my mom immediately started screaming to me that there was dog piss on the floor (it was water that my dad spilt) and yelled at me to clean it up. I later came upstairs to my room and checked my phone because I was going to post this, but then saw something in my inbox. It was a comment from an old friend of mine. We stopped talking after the group we were both in booted me out (because they didnt like that i was mentally fucked up and they made me feel worse about it and as a result started having blackouts and during those blackouts I was unaware that I was writing depressing shit and as a result gave people panic attacks because I didnt realize what I was doing so I didnt put a warning). She said how she admitted the group was a bit harsh on me, she said that she can tell I've grown to become better, and at the end, apologized for it. I fucking started crying and still am, because somebody actually says sorry, its not like an "in your face!" Type thing, it's a bit of weight off my shoulders that im not an absolute bitch, her saying sorry made me realize, im not going fucking crazy and I'm not the only problem, that I'm not just a fuck up. So, you know who you are if you're the one who wrote it, and I want to say thank you, it means a lot, and I'm sorry for everything I've done in the past. The group taught me a lot, I know to control myself and to not have a blackout, to hold back from saying all the depressing shit, to hold my tongue, so thank you.</TEXT>

I know now i should've held my tongue, kept in, tried to control it, but I couldn't, and im sorry for that. I want to go back and say im sorry to everyone, to everyone i hurt without even knowing, but i know i can't. I'm working to keep myself under control. I wish you and the mafia the best.

( I'm more into girls than guys) so even though their not 100% female, I still am attracted because they at least partially are.

    <DATE>2020-07-15 23:40:06</DATE>
    <TEXT>I used to starve myself extremely bad, to the point that I would go the day only eating a snack! I would buy a 12 piece chicken nugget meal and only eat 4 of them for the entire day! Anyway, I want to recover because I hate living like this, but I can't. I started this two years ago and only stoped recently, the thing is, two years ago, I was being bullied, people would say HORRIBLE things about me while I was eating and because of it, no matter how hard i try, i CANNOT eat while people are yelling or just being generally negative. My mother LOVES being pissy and yelling, especially when we eat, so as a result, I'm still not eating and i hate it! Everytime my mom sees my put my food away while she's yelling and eating, she "punishes" me by locking my phone (i have parent lock on my phone) when she knows my phone is my only escape from a panic attack. Then she proceeds to yell at me for having a panic attack. Long story short, I'm still starving against my will. I've just said fuck it at this point and went back to hardly eating. Only a meal a day. I finally told my dad about starving myself and he told me I was crazy and it made me feel even more like shit about it.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I watch Jessie Paege, i know she'll never know, but she literally saved my life. I was starving and self harming (still struggle with both but im getting better) and I was most likely gonna die ( I wanted to starve but it was taking forever and i was about to kms) when i turned to watching her. As a young person in the LGBTQ+ community (I'm bi just like her) her videos meant a lot to me. Just knowing I wasnt alone made me feel so much better i didn't go through killing myself and I started watching her videos to try and help myself get better. Shes a literal life saver, and without her I'd most likely be dead. Thanks to her I've started eating normally once again. I went from eating a single snack a day to now eating two full meals a day! (I'm aware I should eat three, I'm still working on it) and I'm so thankful that Jessie was there to share her story to help me and several other people who needed it.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I haven't been diagnosed with anything but literally everyone but my parents believes i do, so I gotta see (I know I should tell a doctor but i kinda can't and just want some help) so, I starve myself ( most of this is in the past because I'm already working to get better, still not 100% there yet tho) I used to eat once a day, at around 5 pm, and I'd never eat a full meal. Id only have a snack. A big example I use is id go to Chick-fil-A, but a 12 piece count chicken nugget, and eat 4 nuggets one day, and thats all is eat that day, then the next day I'd eat 4 more and thats it, and then the third day id eat the last 4. It'd take me 3 days to eat 12 nuggets! Anyway, I've started getting better thanks to me finding out more about Anorexia and thinking I have it, but i still am not sure if I do/did have it</TEXT>

You see, because of things that happened in the past, I can't eat when people are yelling/fighting or just being over all negative. Even when I wasnt anorexic, I couldnt eat for the life of me when people near me were like that, and because of home life, I have to find times to eat when nobody else is around which is few and far between. Hopefully I'll be able to get over this problem soon and recover tho</TEXT>

    <TITLE>AITA for having several arguments with my mom over my cat?</TITLE>
    <DATE>2020-07-17 09:14:27</DATE>
    <TEXT>Sorry for any spelling errors or weird formatting, on mobile. So, I was saving up at a young age. All the birthday money, christmas money, all that, and by the time i turned twelve I had about 250ish with a couple of dollars in coins (I didn't have a bank account because I was a child) THIS IS IMPORTANT. and I have a cat. (Side note, im very bad mentally and shes my only emotional support so i literally NEED her. She's literally saved my life, as in physically and emotionally) and my cat's a little destructive. My mom also hates my cat (but she hates a lot of things so go figure) so my cat loves my parents room, but my mom won't let her in because she'll accidently claw the furniture when going from one place to another or if she's trying to stand on a nightstand/ dresser or something, so my mom refuses to open the door for her, (understandable right?) Well my cat wanted to get in the room so she started clawing at the rug right under the door. My mom was pissed and shed lash out at me, but I couldn't do anything. Id spray her to get her to run away but shed just come back when I wasn't looking. Anyway, she ended up ripping out an entire chunk of the carpet. I felt so bad because yeah, my cat, my responsibility. So I offered to pay all of my money for them to fix (it'd be a little under the right amount but it cover damn near all the main costs) and my mother refused to accept the money. I kept on insisting but she kept saying no. Cut till recently and my cat hadn't made much of a difference, but my mom was getting more and more aggregated at the missing patch. Shed claim the patch was bigger when it wasn't and shed scream at me over it. By this time I had blown all the money (with her knowing and "allowing" it) but now she demanded I pay up (side note, I don't get allowances, I don't have a job, my family stopped giving me money for birthdays and Christmas so i literally get 0$ a year) and i told her i don't have money. So now she's blaming me for "blowing HER money" and how " I need to pay up" and when i tell her I CAN'T because i have no source of income, she says "oh well, find a way!" She also is trying to get rid of my cat, and doesn't seem to grasp how much that cat means to me (Remember when I said my cat has literally saved my life?) And she keeps yelling at me to get rid of my cat (she also doesnt allow me to have social media so I cant post a "selling cat" page thing or anything even if i wanted to, reddit doesn't count and either way she doesn't know about my reddit) so me and my mom always bud heads about my cat, and while yes, I agree my cat is bad, shes very destructive, I wanted to train her when we first got her and she was a kitten but my mom didn't want to because "she wasn't young enough so it'd be a waste of time, she wont learn" yet now DEMANDS i train her.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Yeah I admit she was continuing, I'm not sure how to explain this, but before the patch that was missing still had two fuzzies (the little carpet string thingies) attached at the center, as well as there were some strings pulled out. She pulled out both the little remaining fuzzies as well as pulling off some of the strings, which was by accident. It happened when my cat was in her room (I agree she shouldn't have been in there tho) and my mom got pissed and started chasing her and her claws were out and as she was running out the door hee claw got stuck. I understand how it wouldn't seem like a big of a deal, but I did my research, and I looked around at companies and all of that and I mean, the patch was fucking tiny to put it bluntly, everyone in the house agrees that it was small. My mom is the type of person who'll go on a rampage because she sees a crumb on the floor (I'm not joking she's done this countless times)</TEXT>

    <DATE>2020-07-18 07:59:28</DATE>
    <TEXT>Told my dad how bad I was starving myself , telling him how i went from like 4 meals a day to only eating a snack a day. He told me it wasn't anorexia , that he did it too (he claimed it was a loss of appetite and when I told him i was hungry and was purposefully starving myself he just brushed it off). Welp. I'm alone. If seen what my dad means, he claims its stress and stuff, but he doesn't know what I'm talking about. But I do. He always tries to act like he went through the same thing when he didn't and I know he didn't. He keeps making jokes everytime I try to talk to him, he treats me like a little kid yet claims he takes me seriously. I want to tell him that I'm cutting myself but i know he'll either act like I'm "just being sad and doing it for attention" or he'll run straight to my mom and tell her. Either way my life woukd be ruined if he found out but I feel like they'res no other way for him to take me seriously about how I'm feeling depressed. Then again he didnt take me seriously when I told him about my suicide thoughts.</TEXT>

    <TITLE>Soooooo I almost killed myself</TITLE>
    <DATE>2020-07-22 07:33:23</DATE>
    <TEXT>So there's a railing on the little ledge from the second story to the first thats by the stairs. I was really depressed and honestly, life has been trying to spoon feed me a shitshow so I was (and still am) ready to go. I grabbed a cord in my room and tied it to the bar, making sure it was tight and secure, then my neck before checking that too. I put one leg over the railing, then started the second, but stopped, and I realized that my 6 year old brother would wake up to the screams of our parents, and he'd walk out of the room still cheery from playing games with our father, to come out and ask "Why is Sissi hanging from the railing?" And I stopped. I untied it and started crying. I waited five minutes, then did it again, but i stopped myself when I started getting my other leg over the railing, my dog was in his cage not too far away. I didn't want him to see my lifeless body hang from there, so I stopped again. I did one last try after. I made it all the way, but didn't jump down. I sat on the railing, my feet dangling, for a while. Just thinking how my birthday was coming up, how my aunt's were so excited. I was growing up, but for them to get a panicked call from my mother hearing that the baby niece they watched grow up, had hung herself just before her birthday. For them to never see me grow up. For my little brother and cousins to have no memories of me since they're all toddlers. I looked over and saw my cat starring at me from behind the railing and I just broke down. My parents would get rid of her the second i was gone because nobody would fight back to keep her. I pulled myself together and walked back downstairs with my cat. I'm now in my room, a crying mess, and questioning going back and doing it again.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>See its things like this that are the reason I'm mentally fucked up. You see, I'm Christian ( No hate to atheists or people with different religions, its just what i personally think) and I'm a demigirl (my gender changes most days but I'm on my girl side and don't change to a 100%boy) and I think that what I'm doing is a sin, that im going to hell for not living up to God's vision. Then I see comments are im all like "FUCK YEAH" and I mean, i feel like God purposefully gave me one, and this, gender because he wanted me to go through this journey to find myself, because he had this vision for me, and he knew how I'd turn out. He gave me dysphoria, he hasn't struck me down for what I'm doing, he made me this way, he made all of us this way, he wouldn't send us to hell for living his visions of us. Its honestly more insulting to god for you to judge people for living their life that HE created, not YOU, so you don't get a right to judge. Sorry I was so serious, I just needed to say it.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Mkay, I'm back, and I have a method a lot of my trans friends used. They use a name that works for both genders but reads more as their birth gender, that way most people who aren't aware they're trans can just think it's a simple name change. For example, names like Kelly, Ashley, Kendall, and Kennedy read as girls names yet could be a guys name, the same for names like Ryan, Max and London, which are seen as males names. Both could be used for the other gender. Hope this has helped  #10084;</TEXT>

    <TITLE>Was this a real spongebob movie?</TITLE>
    <DATE>2020-07-25 08:56:17</DATE>
    <TEXT>Ok, so I watched this movie when I was a kid (NOTE: THIS IS NOT A CREEPYPASTA I FREAKING HATE THOSE AND GENERALLY MEAN WHAT I SAY GOING FORWARD) I watched spongebob a lot. There was this creepy video I saw on youtube called "spongebob lost episode???" And clicked on it because it was spongebob. It was a VHS DVD and the cover was on a kid who seemed to be dressed up as spongebob at a playground, right in front of the swings. I cant place my finger on it because this was full on years ago, but the costume looked off, creepy even. The eyes were weird. Anyway the youtuber said that he found it on the ground of a park he went to (I think, could be wrong, i havent been able to find the youtube video i watched) and was curious. The only thing hinting to anything about it was the fact that the bottom of the cover had the number "666" on it. Now im pretty sure that the youtuber wrote the 666 on it himself to freak somebody out but nonetheless whatever. He pops the VHS in and starts playing it. The music was strangely quiet, and very slow, and the colors were dimmed, but then again the youtube video was horrible quality all around so maybe its just that. Then the movie started, it was of spongebob walking around caves and stuff like that with his arms flailing around. They were in weird positions, as if the length of the arms was changing every frame. Spongebob himself was very unrecognizable, the whole thing was in 3D, and his body would glitch in shape. One second he was a normal square, next he was a rectangle, next one side of him was completely drooping. The audio was of the theme song, but distorted. It was slow, and the voice would change to normal, then high pitched, then deep, and so on. Also, the song would repeat some of the lyrics over and over again. It was over all freaky and lately ive been having hellish nightmares about it and I need to figure out this shitshow movie or I may go insane.</TEXT>

    <TITLE>Weird Mary poppins-like movie</TITLE>
    <DATE>2020-07-26 07:42:07</DATE>
    <TEXT>So I saw parts of a movie when I was a little kid about something similar to mary poppins. It was about a witch-like lady (she had all the bumpy moles, the weird nose, everything, no green skin tho) and she comes to be a nanny for some kids. She has weird powers and lets the kids have fun, but shes really strict on them. She gets frustrated and whatnot. I've been itching to see the whole movie because everytime I bring it up, people always go "dude, you're just talking about mary poppins" trust me, its not. I can't find the movie anywhere and its bugging me, its like its been lost. Was it some sort of knockoff that got pulled off shelves or some lost episode type shit or something? Where is this movie?</TEXT>

You said it yourself "Maybe if you were a little earlier, you could have texted then away" there is a possibility for them to survive! Not all the time when somebody is trying to end it are they 100% sure about their decision, so why leave them be? Do u want all the people who post on here to be ignored? For those who have a shot at life to be lost anyway? People listen to posts like this and i dont understand why.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>The snail slowly slid onto the strange thing that the flesh leaf put it on. It was slimey, as though it were a fellow snail. The snail slowly slid across it, its slimey member forming around, and a hole opening up. It slowly slid its member to the slimey snail like thing. The strange thing was hard, almost like an erection. The snail struggled for a bit, trying to find a place to slid it's little friend, but soon it found a large crease between the hard slimey snail and what felt like a softer version of the flesh leaf. It waited for a bit before starting to pump. It felt it's member slid through the flesh flap, before feeling it's baby juices slide through the flesh flap. It pulled its member back but slowly slid back across and felt it's member drip all across of the strange thing, but the thing didn't seem to mind. The snail went across it and went on its way, to find a nice and safe place for its final rest and off to the afterlife, relieved knowing it had its one mating session, and he didnt live for nothing, it would have babies, the strange thing was carrying its babies. It would thank the thing, but the snail was dying, it wanted to find a safe place. It was ready, it's bloodline would continue...</TEXT>

I've called myself a demigirl for a while because thats the only thing i know about that sounds like what i am. Can y'all help me out? I'm very confused on what label to give myself.

    <TEXT>Ok, so, I believe I'm Genderfaer and if not I'm a demigirl so either way, yeah. I'm also a bisexual. I'm Christian, and I personally don't understand how its a sin or a bad thing like most christians say. It's stated in the bible that judging others is a sin, its said that all sins are equal (example: judging is just as bad as being a mass murderer in gods eyes) so technically by being homophobic/transphobic, they're sinning just as much as they claim us to be running. And the bible states that god loves everyone, so technically, Homophobics/transphobic who use god to back them up really have no backup. Sorry for the really Christian speech, i just wanted to prove that they really have no excuse by their own logic.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I have been sh and trying to kms for almost two years. I was bullied my whole life, I was assaulted a handful of times, I'm not happy in my own home. I have been starving myself almost this whole year, ive taken multiple online mental health quizzes and all say I'm at serious risk with my mental health, my parents still say that its just "Teen angst" and full heartedly believe that i can control my emotions, that im holding myself back, and to "Just think positive" and I'll be fine because in their eyes I dont have a single problem in life. It's why ive been attempting to end it all for so long. I feel worthless. I can't get any sort if therapy and I feel so alone. What should i do?</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Guys, remember he is Asian. You can't simply tell him not to look it up. The question clearly wasn't "how many feet are in a yard" so its not like he was looking up the exact answer. Realize that this teacher is literally getting in the way of his learning over ONE QUESTION. She could possibly be hurting his knowledge because he'll be spending time in a class of things he knows or of things that he will NOT BE SPENDING TIME LEARNING. This teacher expects to message him while he's taking a test OVER GETTING MAD AT HIM FOR USING THE DEVICE FOR SOMETHING ELSE. And to those saying use a different device, not everyone has access to multiple devices. I grew up without more than a singly device until 7th grade, and i know people who still dont have multiple. You need to be in his shoes. Are you all really about to tell me you've never cheated on anything before? Bullshit.</TEXT>
