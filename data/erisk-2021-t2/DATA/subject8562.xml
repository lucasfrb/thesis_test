You should completely avoid provoking him when it #8217;s just the two of you alone. Also if it comes to it which I hope it doesn #8217;t, just kill the bastard before he kills you. At this point you gotta think about yourself and the baby. Not that shitty man who #8217;s gonna be it #8217;s father. Good luck though and stay safe</TEXT>
