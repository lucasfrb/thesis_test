    <TEXT>Hello my brethren in God The Father And in Jesus Christ The Son of God, I am a Greek orthodox Christian and I am a little confused about prayer, I sometimes pray to God The Father including in my prayer"In the name of Jesus Christ Thy Son"and when I fear God doesn't hear my prayer because of my sins I pray to Lord Jesus Christ Who sacrificed Himself and resurrected so He could bridge the divide between God and man, back to my question, I believe in both God The Father and Our Lord Jesus Christ The Son of God but who do I pray to? To our Lord or to God? Is it forbidden because of our sins to pray directly to God?</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Norp is an anagram for adult movies I dislike it but it's a strong addiction that I can't find a way out of I am willing to forgive anyone but is it a sin to cut ties with a person who forces you against the wall leaving you with no breathing room? (overburdening you with their problems and whining ) Anyways I pray for God and Our Lord to keep him alive and help him pull through,he has been in this condition for months and if he is alive God must have a reason but I also fear that God will take him away just to punish me for the aforementioned sin</TEXT>

I profess my faith by believing in God The Father And Our Lord Jesus Christ The Son of God and Our Saviour (I also say this in every post because people are like if you don't speak the name of The Lord when talking about Him you are worshipping the devil) trying to be a better person for both improving my personality in order to bring happiness to others and because I look up to God and Our Lord, I don't read the Bible 24/7, I pray nearly all day because I know I am a sinner and unworthy of God's love and I never forget about Our Lord's sacrifice and resurrection and I pray that God and Our Lord not to abandon the ones that need Them, I help people whenever I have the opportunity out of the goodness God and Our Lord gave me not to get to heaven but because I love everyone equally I don't put much emphasis on saints and because I don't have all the answers about God and Our Lord I Trust in Them, and finally I believe in God and Our Lord until the end and I put everything in Their hands, if I am going to hell or non-existence for not attending to church or reading the Bible 24/7 that's God's decision, at least I'll say I tried in this life</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Going to church and reading the Bible 24/7 and praying all day every day is not the only way to deepen your relationship with God and Our Lord, trusting Them and loving Them with all your soul and heart works also, I trust God and Our Lord to lead me to the right path, by her words its like she is saying you will not be saved because you don't attend to church, read the Bible and you don't pray nonstop, thus you don't want to pursue a relationship with God and Our Lord, I allow God and Our Lord to do what They Know is right and best for my life because I trust Them if you think that's not enough and condemn me to hell then yours is a doctrine of hate</TEXT>

    <TEXT>My brethren, on my last post I argued with a Catholic brother/sister because of a misunderstanding and because they never clarified what they said meant, I told them that if they judge me and condemn me to hell for not attending to church and reading the Bible as well as praying and helping people 24 /7, then their doctrine is built on hate, after I said that and realized what I said I prayed for forgiveness from God and Our Lord because i didn't know what I was saying or meant , but I fear when I said that, God and Our Lord immediately abandoned me and locked me out of Their Love forever, I guess no matter how much I beg for forgiveness I will never come back to God and Our Lord</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Forgive me if I misread a post/comment and correct me because it's been a while, someone said something along the lines that God doesn't work with terms and conditions when it comes to salvation, but others In this sub say that you are supposed to be entirely holy and sinless otherwise God won't love you and won't save you, so for me that I am a sinner(fapping is the only sin I am still struggling with) But I try my best to live under God's and Our Lord's teachings and loving everyone, being forgiving and most of the time forgetful and praising, begging for forgiveness from God and Our Lord and praying all the time for forgiveness and mercy, am I doomed for this one sin?</TEXT>

    <TITLE>Something weird is going on and i am freaking out</TITLE>
    <DATE>2020-05-16 21:15:56</DATE>
    <TEXT>Hello everyone,i am a student in I.T. and because of the COVID-19 we are reduced to online lessons,not that it bothers me because it is the basis of I.T. to use the computer for studying and learning all there is to it,but truth is,now it bothers me,let me start at the beginning. A month ago we were supposed to have our final online lesson before starting school and work(i'm in a student program for ages between 18-25 they also provide us with work for 2 years)but our teacher never sent us the link to the lesson,we tried calling his cellphone but the line was dead,we haven't heard from him for two weeks,that's where things start to get creepy,i got an email two fridays ago for an I.T. lesson and i was the only participant,i was weirded out because not only was i the only participant but there was no sender,to my idiocy i actually clicked the agree button and when it was time for the lesson i joined in but there was no one there,my camera was only showing me,i tried calling my classmates but their lines were busy,i sticked around for 15 minutes and when i saw no one joined i left and went to sleep. When i woke up i had a headache and went to the bathroom to take a painkiller but when i looked at the mirror i saw strange red symbols on the wall but when i looked behind me i didn't see anything and i thought it was a post-sleep hallucination because when i looked at the mirror everything was back to normal,i didn't give it too much thought back then but things escalated for the worse after this. After that day my headaches grew worse and due to the quarantine i thought i was losing my mind,when i looked at my mirror again i saw blood everywhere,on the walls,on the furniture,everywhere,the more days passed the worse my head started hurting,and only last friday did things start becoming threatening,when i looked in the mirror i didn't see my reflection i saw something else,it was a buff reptilian skeletal creature with black holes for eyes and mouth but it matched my movements on the mirror,i ran out of the bathroom and tried to get out of my house but i couldn't find my keys and i haven't found them since and now i can't unlock the door,the windows are out of the question because i live at the fourth floor of the building so i would be jumping to my death. It's been a horrible week,my reflection went back to normal after that incident and there is no blood in the mirror anymore,but that's not what freaks me out, ever since this week started i've been hearing a weird clanking noise near midnight as if something is being dragged around,and it's getting closer,last night i heard the noise and it's just right next door,i am afraid to look through the doorhole and an awful odor is coming from the building,i fear whatever is out there has killed my neighbours and i am next,i just heard the clanking noise outside my door,i'm going to hide,if you hear a clanking noise outside your door,don't open it,good luck.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Tl;Dr Did God only provide me with two chances in romance and messed both of them up? God has provided me countless chances for friendships and i guess a few chances for love but i keep messing up on both due to bullying ptsd and just now getting into socializing,when i started baking classes i instantly fell in love with a girl i saw and i know i fell in love with her because i hadn't felt like this ever since junior high school,we started talking normally and i struck a friendship with both her and another girl as well as a guy,everything was going fine,i even invited her out three times to hang out with a few close friends and they pushed us together and i learned that she liked me too,but when i confessed i saw her like that,she gave me a half-hearted me too,and through our texts and close meetings she always seemed cold and distant and because i am a fool and i have no idea how to socialize and pursue a relationship i wasn't sure how to ask her,i told her two times to go out on a date but she changed the subject and obviously it didn't work out,then the other girl started clinging to me but when people brought this up as a crush she said we were just friends,she gave me mixed signals too and because i am new to this relationship/friendship thing i don't know how to handle either a relationship or friendship,then my ex-flame said that the other girl loved me but every time this came up she insisted we are just friends,and i agreed,but now i seem to mess up in friendship too,before i went to the I.T. class we were close friends,but now we haven't talked in months,but i am wondering,what if these two girls were the only choices for a relationship God provided me with?</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Tl;DR a person called my name and asked me what I am doing in this town(suburbs) and how I have been doing but even if I talked to him like we are old friends I don't remember him or where we met and it's making me feel like I am the worst person ever because I mostly remember close circle friends Due to my bullying ptsd I find it hard to grow close to others and make friends, I only have a small and humble circle of friends I truly trust and want to keep in my life and I fear that is a sin because we are called to love everyone, don't get me wrong I love everyone but that doesn't mean that I want everyone in my life, and forgive me again if it's a sin, anyways due to trying my best to be as kind and good and understanding and loving to everyone I kind of attract a lot of people (this is not bragging by the way just what I have noticed) but the thing is I choose who I want in my life and who to leave behind but mostly because I am not comfortable around most people, so anyways a friend dropped me off near my block after we hang out and when I passed through the newsstand I heard someone calling my name and asking in surprise that I lived here and how I was doing but I freaked out and rushed the convo but acted as if we were old friends and we said good night, but here is where I get to the point, many people I have met remember me but I don't and that make me feel like the worst person ever created and the Most irredeemable sinner that deserves hell or even oblivion</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Sorry I was actually Going to put the answer in the reply, the truth is I don't know why things happen like that but I can't doubt God for a reason, when most of my Kin died during the period of time I was sinning (7 years) I thought that God did it to punish me and I also had that fear that He caused my best friend's accident to punish me but a while ago while I was in doubt I looked back at everything good God has done for the world and for individuals as well as what He has done for my family and it brings me back to Jesus Christ, God gave His own Son to the world so he would be sacrificed to save us from our sins and I believe in Jesus Christ because of mine and others experiences, now you will ask me, why does sin exist? I don't know but I don't believe it was God's intention for sin to exist and enter the world, my opinion is that God knew the dangers of giving everyone free will even amongst His angels but He gave us free will because He loves us</TEXT>

    <TEXT>He creates things, He told them don't eat from that tree, but He also gave them free will to do what they want if they used that free will for an action He forbid then it was on them, God loves everyone so much that He gave us free will and can't bring Himself to take it away because of this love, take away free will and you are a mindless drone, God won't force anyone to believe in Him,He gives us signs that lead us to Him but we choose whether or not to follow these signs, sure we should be skeptical about these signs but I followed them and they led me to God and Our Lord, I doubt again sure but God and Our Lord show me the way back over and over again, when I witness things that show God is real I am in no position to doubt, sure I fall to skepticism again but every time God did something that brought me back</TEXT>

Don't worry, I am pretty sure God knows you have ocd and He won't blame you for anything your ocd does, you can't control it and it's fine your ocd is at work here with the rush promises, by the way I suggest that, instead of making rush promises just trust in God and Our Lord and talk to Him and have a normal relationship with Him, trust me I've feared God more times than I can count but everything I have experienced traces back to God sending our Lord here in order to connect the divide between God and us.</TEXT>

I live in a moderate house with a moderate budget so I don't have the convenience to help everyone, we do give food and other important things to our church in order for them to provide to people in need (we trust the church that is less corrupt ) and we help people when we have the ability to do so</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I'll get quite a lot of flack for posting this but here it goes I consider myself a humble Christian, I love God The Father And Our Lord Jesus Christ The Son of God and Our Saviour, I pray as much as possible (not constantly and nonstop I don't know how you Guys /Gals do it but I can't) I go to church only to light candles, Pray to God The Father And Our Lord and cross myself, but I don't stay for the sermons, I much prefer to go about my Normal humble life (school, work, VideoGames, music, animes, talking with my family etc) but I always include prayer while doing these activities, when I pray to God I pray (God The Father Of All, in the name of Lord Jesus Christ Thy Son Whom sacrificed Himself and resurrected after 3 days and ascended to Thy Kingdom so the divide between You and us sinners could be linked, I confess my undying love and trust to You and Lord Jesus Christ and I beg that You show mercy and I repent for my sins) because I live with my family with a moderate budget and in a moderate house we help those in need only when we have the ability to do so, give food and drink to the homeless people who don't have needle holes in their arms but only if we have the ability to do so, but there's also two other downsides to this I might try to live my life following God's and Our Lord's commandment but I fall to sin (m*********n) and I'm getting in a roller coaster ride of self loathing, intrusive thoughts that God hates me and doesn't want anything to do with me and the other downside is that I don't know who I am anymore, I try to be a good person and loving everyone and I don't find it that hard to do but a part of me dislikes and fears the way the world has fallen into sin, party animals, sexualy immoral hormone induced teenagers, alpha males and beta males, so much hate and warmongers, please tell me your opinions and give me advice relating to this topic</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Ever since I learned about Christianity I have had experiences and witnessed what could only be call miracles and though I am quite skeptical I can be skeptical for so long, when I listen or see experiences of other Christians I cross-reference my experiences other people's experiences and what the word of God says and if it is all connected my faith skyrockets, but alas I don't know Who God truly is, I believe that He sent Our Lord Jesus Christ His only Son so that He would sacrifice Himself and ressurect so everyone who believes in Him is saved and enters the family of God and its something I always wanted, but due to circumstances I have a fear that Jesus Christ is Good and Loving and God is a Good but very serious and very punishing Creator and Father. Because of my constant fapping ever since 2012 and the suspicious deaths of both my father(high sugar levels/heart failure/not taking his medication and me being distant because I was afraid he would keep me in his custody for 9 months) and my godfather(supposedly appendicitis burst but my mother says it was cancer) within the year as well as my grandfather's (acute respiratory infection/2016) and uncle's (liver cancer, /late 2018) and now the sudden and shocking accident my best friend had 7 months ago and his surgery- contracted meningitis, and his constant struggle(hopehe is still alive) for survival have led me to the conclusion that because I fap, God hates me and wants to punish me by hurting and killing my loved ones I just can't stop worrying about what God wants from me and my best friend and why He would punish others for my sins, and no before u/Luiz_Cannibal say that I have a mental illness I am not mentally ill I just have come to this conclusion due to my losses. Also a good friend's father died from lung cancer back in 2017 and I feel i was responsible due to fapping Also also find me scriptural verses that disprove my fear and give me advice and scriptural advice BTW Deadpool before you comment on this know that I always repent</TEXT>

    <DATE>2020-05-30 13:39:09</DATE>
    <TEXT>1)I'm worried because despite the sins and mistakes my best friend did, he was finally turning his life around and now he is in this difficult state where his health fluctuates and he is only 24, we've known each other for 7 years and we consider each other brothers, had he been wearing a helmet the damage dealt would be lesser but all I ask from God is for my bro to pull through and make it out of this situation alive, even if the damage is there he will still be alive. 2)i find it way too difficult to trust God because my best friend is still in this difficult situation and ever since last Saturday we haven't heard from his parents, the last thing they said was that he had a slight fever that had dropped with pills and that a week had passed ever since they stopped the antibiotics treatment and that if the fever was persisting the doctor told them to get him to the hospital for checkups, but what scares me the most is that it's said if you have a fever and take antifever pills they just conceal the fever and the underlying disease and you think you're fine when you're not.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I doubt my faith so much nearly all the time but I never lose it because God and Our Lord give me a sign to follow and it brings me back, because of my experiences and other believers experiences I traced these experiences back to the Bible and God, and every time I have trusted in God and Our Lord They always answer but at Their own time but the wait and burden I go through is worth It in the end I'm never going to become an atheist or nihilist because I have stopped doubting tonight, I have counted how many times God has answered me after I trusted Him and I just can't deny Him anymore tonight He answered and took my week-long fear away and comforted me</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Well He does answer sometimes immediately some times a week a month or years later but His answer always comes and even if it's not what I prayed for I later understand that when things don't work out as you like them the end result Is better for you, His presence in my family's life is undeniable even I who am critical about such things God is like "oh ho so you are critical eh? Alright then let's play a game that's called follow the signs and come to my family." when I learned about Christianity I immediately believed and despite the fact that I have gone through doubt and I doubt for long periods of time God always sends a sign and I Check out the Bible and cross-reference the events and if they overlap with each other It means it's a sign from God, when I pray I might feel spiritually numb but when my head is clear I feel closer to God and realize that I don't feel anything when I am worried about earthly things instead of focusing on God and Our Lord Who are Good and Loving and trusting Them</TEXT>

    <DATE>2020-06-01 04:01:13</DATE>
    <TEXT>I chose to give myself up to God The Father And Our Lord Jesus Christ The Son of God and Our Saviour entirely yesterday no doubts and living in sin anymore, but I fear I am lukewarm because I don't attend to church and pray to saints instead I go to God and Our Lord Themselves with my problems and pray to Them but I fear that because I don't evangelize, pray to saints, attend to church (I go and light candles I am very antisocial and I don't like being around large crowds) and I only help others when I have the ability to also we have a lot of addicts in my country and Its difficult to tell who needs real help. Anyways the point is that due to our and the neighboring country's forefathers fucking up everything and exchanging countries and making deals and going to wars with each other, we are paying the price for over sixty years at least, the neighboring country is using intimidation tactics, sending warplanes and immigrants at full force at our borders and demanding to get our lands, NATO and the E. U. are supposedly allies but because of this whole survival of the fittest, natural selection and who dares wins bullshit, they condone that country to keep up with its behavior , and nearly everyone in my country says that if a war happens we are all alone, regardless if they start the war or not we won't be getting any help from anyone and everyone will either join forces with them or they'll stand in the background and provide them with weapons and technology. After my father died I became a complete pacifist and now that the end draws near I will have to fight kill or die just to satisfy the bloodlust of warmonger politicians and military higher-ups and its just unfair, I beg you for your silence because talking badly about the military or the governments will put you in their hit list, if I die in the War then I have no idea where I'll go. I just hope that this post doesn't provoke the war.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Tldr:How to force myself to go to church and pray nonstop? I told God and Our Lord I will try my best to live according to the commandments and I will pray to them for guidance and repent and ask for forgiveness but, I find it extremely difficult to go to church for the divine liturgy and in the past whenever I tried to stay for it I ended up getting bored to death, I find it easier to pray to God and Our Lord and light candles rather than stay and listen to the preacher, and also there's another problem, I pray to God in the Name of Our Lord for forgiveness and guidance but I can't bring myself to pray nonstop, even if I pray I will take a break and after a while I will pray again then I occupy myself with other things, music, singing, playing games, scrolling reddit, then I remember I am an awful Christian because I don't pray to God The Father during that time and I take a break from these activities and pray to God The Father for a while and I start the activities again while also praying every 5 or so minutes, nearly all of you are foaming at the mouth right now because in your words I am not a true Christian, but I am here to just ask for advice</TEXT>

    <DATE>2020-06-04 10:12:09</DATE>
    <TEXT>I pray that all of you enter God's and Our Lord's family and Kingdom but I have a question, if there's no marriage in heaven doesn't that mean the bonds of the earthly family(mom dad children) are destroyed and the only family you have and need is only God The Father Our Lord and The Holy Spirit As for me I am going to hell or oblivion because I love God The Father And I consider Him my true father but He probably doesn't love me back and that's why our relationship is still stuck in the Master /servant relationship, when I try to stay for the divine liturgy I pull my hair out of boredom and I light candles, pray then leave, I don't help the homeless everyday due to my schedule being either too exhausting or when I am home I rarely go out of my suburban area due to my fear of people due to bullying (and I haven't seen too many homeless around but I do help them when I am able to do so and when I do help them I do it genuinely ) Pros:I truly believe in God The Father And Our Lord Whom The Father sent so He could teach us God's Love then He sacrificed Himself at the cross and resurrected so we could be saved and enter God's family by believing in Him, God and asking for The Holy Spirit and live a humble life loving our neighbors and God I try my best to live according to the commandments and having faith and praying nearly all day When I help the poor and downtrod I do it genuinely and when I can't help them I feel so heartbroken because they shouldn't be suffering like this, but what can you do with the government and most percentage of the world being prideful, greedy, hateful and having a survival of the fittest outlook in life? Cons:I can't stand listening to the divine liturgy for over an hour and I light candles then pray an leave the church I don't have the ability to help the poor and downtrod every day and I fear that God doesn't love me for this Due to God's omnipotence and His unlimited nature and of Christians here saying that if you don't feed the poor everyday and give up everything then you don't really follow God and Our Lord, I fear that God doesn't love me and due to certain circumstances in my life I fear His punishment and that when I die He will send me straight to oblivion, and that's why our relationship is still at the Master /fearful servant relationship.</TEXT>

    <TITLE>Why do I doubt when all my loved ones find faith?</TITLE>
    <DATE>2020-06-17 10:16:41</DATE>
    <TEXT>I've been struggling with sin and doubt for 8 whole years and when I was about to stop believing God and Our Lord always found a way to bring me back but then my doubts started again and I was thinking, what if all these experiences are just random luck? I've had many people in my life who believe in God The Father And Our Lord Jesus Christ The Son of God and trust Them completely and I am completely crushed that I can't trust God infinity percent completely, I am an awful abomination that shouldn't have existed, why can't I trust God completely?my stepsister and I got into an argument once about God and she said she didn't believe and it crushed me but then slowly with my family's and mine help she developed a better personality and I think she might even believe, my sworn brother before the accident told me to always believe in God The Father And Our Lord no matter what, because He created us and loves us and is always with us, and even if my bro led a difficult life he always believed and If God gives him a second chance in life I am sure he will follow him until the end,in fact he is the only person ever to restore my faith, but after the accident I have fallen into doubt again. A few days ago I learned that my aunt has problems with hearing on one ear and I also learned that my cousin who Is too critical of Christianity and who also told me why do I believe if there's no proof, two years ago, he lit candles for her and prayed for her and sent her a prayer and he also asked her if God was punishing him, and I think he is starting to believe too. I've experienced what can only be explained as God's and Our Lord's love and miracles in the past and even nowadays but If my mind wasn't so critical I would be 100%sure that it was due to God, I feel so sad and horrible that I have doubts and I fear God's judgment on this, why do others close to me believe and I have trouble with my faith? No one from my family and loved ones attend to church all the time or read the Bible but I know that they all trust God and His plan and they believe. Why am I the exception? I believe ever since 5 or 6 years old and I've changed from an evangelizing Christian kid who condemned nonbelievers to a more (calm, loving everyone, forgiving everyone, slow to anger, hate the sin love the sinner (I'm an exception to this rule, I hate my sin and I hate myself), trying to follow Our Lord Jesus Christ's commandments and keeping Him and God in my life first,) Christian, And I have the audacity to doubt? What am I doing wrong?does God not want me in His family? For all those years I longed for Him to be my True Father and be in His family because my sin and my misfortune in life have broken me down to nothingness, I only want God and Our Lord and Their love, i need Them to comfort me, I want to cry and know that They will be by my side, I just don't want to be alone, without Them I am nothing, and it feels like God is testing me or has abandoned me because I have failed and disappointed Him Tl;Dr I'm just a broken man who only wants God and Our Lord's love and to be in Their Family, my loved ones believe and I have doubts but I always come back when I remember Lord Jesus Christ's sacrifice and resurrection was because of God's love for everyone and for us to enter His family, I'm a sinner and I hate myself and my sin and that's making me feel like I am unloved by God and Our Lord and that I don't deserve Their love and salvation, I hope you all enter God's kingdom because my doubting and my mistakes have pushed God away from me and my final destination is hell/oblivion</TEXT>

    <DATE>2020-06-18 10:09:57</DATE>
    <TEXT>So I was wondering and I actually took my thought up to God Himself, I told Him that if I could turn back time I would go back to when Our Lord Jesus Christ The Son of God and Our Saviour taught, and I would forsake everything and follow Him , I would see Him resurrected and I would become a martyr for my faith, but I have a question, if time traveling was possible and I could turn back time to when Our Lord taught sacrificed Himself and resurrected, then wouldn't that mean He wouldn't be there because He already resurrected? Of course this would mean that if time traveling was possible and Our Lord would not come back to save everyone who followed Him again, it would create an alternate timeline where we(Christians) wouldn't exist and no one would be saved P. S. I believe because of my countless experiences with God's and Our Lord's love And witnessing things that can only be explained as miracles, I am a critical person but everything up till now have led me to God The Father And Our Lord Jesus Christ.</TEXT>

    <DATE>2020-06-19 08:44:33</DATE>
    <TEXT>I am 23 straight male, I believe in God The Father And Our Lord Jesus Christ The Son of God and I try(emphasis on try) my best to love everyone and make all people I meet happy, and try my best to live under God's and Our Lord's commandments, I can't help every homeless person but I help those who truly need it(here in Greece most homeless are drug addicts or gipsies(no offense) who will use any means necessary to get money so I don't trust them and only help those who truly are homeless due to tragic circumstances) Whenever I see someone that I am unable to help at the time I lower my head and It hurts me because I don't know what's the right thing to do, I hope God can show mercy and forgive me for what I've done or for what I haven't done. Anyways here's the second trigger point, there's a fluctuation of LGBT all around the world, a friend of mine is a lesbian but she is a fun person to be around, though due to me being antisocial and afraid to hang out with people due to bullying in the past, I rarely hang out with her and I only hang out with people close to me, anyways despite her sexuality she is a good friend and I am always happy when we talk and she never brings up religious(and I guess she is a believer which makes me happy despite her sexuality) or LGBT convos and neither do I, I have other acquainteces however that not only bring up the LGBT in a convo but when I say I tolerate the way they are living their lives and to each their own but I don't support them and never will, they go all "you are not open minded, you should get on with the times, it's normal Yada Yada Yada" science says it's Normal, I don't believe that, so they are good and we are evil for being Christians and having such "old outdated intolerant and racist beliefs", God and Our Lord prophecized all of these would happen in the Bible 2000+ years ago and people still don't believe, good will be called evil and evil good. And don't get me started with those parades here in Greece where they blasphemize God and Our Lord and wear crucifixes and tattoos and even cross play as Our Lord (I'm going to hell for this pun but I couldn't resist) and blaspheming everything Christianity stands for and everyone just allows them to do what they want even mock our faith without taking them to court, this is infuriating but our faith calls for us to love them and trust and love God and Our Lord until the end</TEXT>

Also there is the root of all evil, fapping, I can't resist the urge and no matter how much I beg for forgiveness and for strength to stop it and change, I can't, I am a prisoner and that's probably because I believe I am the worst person and I am not good enough for Our Lord and God The Father, and that I won't be able to enter Their family no matter how much I love Them because I didn't do enough good deeds in life and because I didn't go to church and because I fall into fapping. There's really no hope for me</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Thank you my friend, well that's a pleasant surprise I am a huge fan of the dynasty warriors and romance of the three kingdoms series, I've known him for 8 years and through the hardships and always arguing with one another we became brothers, two different personalities living two different lives but still there for each other when the other needed it most and still craving for the same thing in life, he grew up psychologically two years ago but I guess 7 or 8 months ago he got drunk and he fell from his bike and due to surgery going wrong he struggles to survive, thanks for praying for him</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Am I the lukewarm Christian for not attending to church except to light candles and pray ? Am I the lukewarm Christian if I am unable to give away all my possessions and house because I live with my parents? Am I the lukewarm Christian because I can't afford to help every single homeless in my country when I am living in a moderate budget ? Also here in Greece many are drug addicts or Gipsies who beg on the streets and most of them are extremely dangerous and quick to violence especially if you're alone, man or woman , some are also armed and might kill you for money . Am I the lukewarm Christian if I don't preach the gospel on the streets at all sinners (including me) but instead I opt to lead people to God and Christ through a warm welcome and greeting them with a smile and asking them about their lives and if they are going through troubles I offer them comforting words?I can't win every one over but the people I meet some have become believers due to my treatment over them Am I the lukewarm Christian if I pray more to God The Father in The Name of Our Lord Jesus Christ, than praying to Our Lord Jesus Christ?</TEXT>

    <TITLE>When will people start focusing on Lord Jesus Christ The Son of God and stop focusing too much on religion?</TITLE>
    <DATE>2020-06-27 10:00:39</DATE>
    <TEXT>He came to this earth 2000 years ago 100 percent Man and God, taught everyone how to be saved, Believe in God The Father And loving and treating everyone with love, compassion and forgiveness, I am a Greek Christian Orthodox but seeing too many people arguing about differing denominations and calling each other fake Christians and condemning everyone , I look way back into the past, before the church was created, and the One that links everyone in Christianity is Our Lord. He was born as a God/Man on this earth, grew up and taught how to be saved that He was the Son of God, the Messiah, He performed miracles to show His True Divine Nature and to see who would follow Him due To His miracles and who would follow Him because He is The Son of God And also Man/God , but in the end only a little group truly believed Him and they became His disciples, after He passed all His knowledge to the disciples, He was betrayed and was crucified, and after His resurrection which was the beginning of Christianity, He requested from His disciples to spread the word that He had risen from the dead, and those who believe in God The Father And Him and try their best to live a life according to the commandments and His teachings and loving and caring for people genuinely, they will be saved. Tl;dr:follow Our Lord Jesus Christ The Son of God and believe in God The Father while loving and caring for everyone and while trying to live a life according to the commandments and Our Lord's teachings, no reason to bite each other because of different churches, we all agree on three things, God and Our Lord, the crucifixion and resurrection and trying our best to live a Christian life (believing in God and Our Lord and loving and caring for everyone from the bottom of our souls.) People saying that going to church is a must to be saved(orthodox Christianity) or being in a specific church to be saved (catholics) focus too much on religion and denomination and focus too less on God The Father And Our Lord. Want to go on missions and teach others of Our Lord and God The Father? Go for it, just don't force them and condemn them to hell, instead of pushing the church to them, lead them with gentleness and love to God and Our Lord. Want to volunteer to help others? Definitely go for it, I can't for a few reasons but I try my best to help those in need when I have the ability to do so. Want to go street preaching?! If your country allows it, go do it, but don't you dare start condemning others and spouting hellfire if they don't repent, just say that we are all sinners and that God and Our Lord love us nonetheless and if we follow Them we can be forgiven and say that the true reason to follow God and Our Lord is because They want us to be in Their Family and Kingdom and if they want to follow Them it must shouldn't be for any other gain other than a relationship with God and Our Lord</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I'm not going to answer your first question but I'll answer the second To you it might be a fairytail, I am a critical thinker and I don't believe without proof, when something happens that is suspiciously otherworldly, I analyze it from every corner I check if science can't explain it and if it can't then I cross-reference it with Christianity and if it lines up perfectly It makes my faith grow stronger and this has happened too many times in my life for me to doubt Christianity , when I learned about Christianity I believed instantly and every day that goes by I always look out for any signs and hours, days, months or even years later a sign appears and I follow it back to God and Our Lord just when I'm about to fall into your nihilistic territory. To be blunt don't be an asshole because you don't believe and because you were hurt by so-called Christians, we Christians go through a lot of bad shit and pain but we are strong and trust in God, want to blame someone for your pain? Blame the assholes out in the world who use their God given free will to make other miserable, I don't know what happens after death to these people but unless they truly regret and repent and believe they either go to hell or erased from existence I am a Christian but it's better to be honest than to lie and give you comfortable words, swearing? I don't care, I've been through a lot and life isn't sunshine and rainbows even to a Christian, and my faith also fluctuates all the time but I keep strong in the faith,God bless you and your family my friend, just keep on living and don't listen to asshole christians, even I am annoyed but God and Our Lord teach love care and forgive and I want to try my best because to me only God and Our Lord matter and I've been broken to the point I want to be in Their Family.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I told God The Father that if I could go back in time, I would follow Our Lord Jesus Christ The Son of God and would become a disciple because God and He Is eternal and infinite and because I want God and Our Lord(and the Holy Spirit I never forget it) to be my true family, these past 7-8 years (I've lost count from my grief) God has taken away nearly everyone I Care about one way or another in an attempt to follow Him and have and love only Him in my life and I try my best to follow him and within my sadness He just up and disappears leaving me in my emptiness and sadness, He doesn't want me to feel close to Him, He doesn't want me to be saved and be in His family, He has just abandoned me when I need Him the most I've stopped focusing on my family for His sake, and praying all the time and begging for forgiveness and for my family's protection as well as those who need Him, but my prayers fall on deaf ears and it doesn't seem He cares. This brings to mind Death Stranding where Amelie and Bridget are the same as person but Bridget is distant from Sam and Amelie is kind and caring , my point is that God is judgemental and distant and Our Lord Jesus Christ The Son of God and Our Saviour is the kind and caring one Who really Loves us, that's why I have problems trusting God and because I focus more on God The Father than Our Lord I want to fix my relationship with God first Then worship both Him and The Trinity but God doesn't listen and He won't</TEXT>

When an unexplainable phenomena occurs, because I'm a critical thinker I cross-reference it with the Bible and I also look at the atheist perspective and if it can't be explained by science and it lines up perfectly with what little I know from the Bible (I don't have a Bible but I search for verses online) my faith grows stronger, and then I remember vague experiences and some not so vague from the past and I also look at historical records of Our Lord existing and teaching and being crucified and I come back to God</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Earlier today I said to God The Father Himself that the reason why I couldn't trust Him was because my sworn brother is still in danger and that until his health got better I wouldn't trust Him, well God was waiting for this moment to answer and leave me alone forever, He did answer but not the question I had asked, we learned earlier that my sworn brother 8 months ago went out with friends to drink and he got wasted and he wanted to leave early because he had work the other day and he fell on a road bump and crashed with his head without wearing a helmet, this proves two things, one that it was and still Is a miracle he is alive and his health is slowly getting better, and second, God didn't cause the accident because of my sinning, now I don't doubt God and Our Lord's existence but I fear They abandoned me because I threw a tantrum and that this was the last straw, I apologized immediately after and no matter how I beg now for forgiveness for what I said, I feel like my words turn to dust, also I have angered many of you for posting my worries here, I don't expect you to forgive me, there's no forgiveness for all I've done.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>So if I try to live a normal(not extreme ) Christian life and if I believe in God The Father And Our Lord Jesus Christ, but struggle with pron addiction and fapping, I'm not a true Christian? FYI I know I'm a sinner and I don't like it, but an addiction that begins from earlier than 2012 and being told that it's normal when it isn't, really did a number on me. To those who support fapping, it's a sin and its not normal.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>First of all I want your opinion on Greece, I think my eye has noticed some condescending comments about Greece and Our people and I am not cool with that especially If it's coming from Christian brethren, just because of a few rotten apples don't generalize because not every Greek is the same. Second of all, due to Greece and Turkey being at heated odds with each other due to political, economical and historical reasons, I fear the worst and if the worst case scenario occurs I doubt my survival, I am a complete pacifist and I don't know why there's so much enmity between our countries, and I doubt I am saved, I am struggling with fapping and I fear that if I die I will go to hell, I believe in God The Father And Our Lord Jesus Christ The Son of God and in the Holy Spirit, and I ask for forgiveness for my sin, but I fear God won't forgive me. And third of all, if the worst case scenario occurs, will it be God's will so that the sinners including me will be annihilated?</TEXT>

    <DATE>2020-07-14 10:00:42</DATE>
    <TEXT>I remembered all God has done for me and I'm more calm because I believe that God is like our parents, we always need Him but He expects us to stand on our own two feet and not being depended on Him all the time ,He gave us the commandments and Our Lord to save us and to follow in His footsteps, and He will always be there for us when we need Him, for me, I'm too clingy on Him because I'm sad, scared and alone and in need of His love, but I see now that God would prefer me to live a normal life while also believing in Him and praising and praying rather than clinging to Him all the time in fear of Him abandoning me. Tl;Dr:God is a parent, parents don't want their kids to be clingy and dependent on them all the time, they want them to stand on their feet and live their lives but they are still there when you need them most, God is there when you need Him but you shouldn't be clingy, live your life and If you hit a hard wall know that God loves you eternally and He will help you out, just don't give up and say, why don't You answer and love me?

    <TEXT>It all started when I was 4 or 6 years old and my mischievous cousin started playing resident evil 2 and dying to zombies thus causing this terrifying game over sequence that some time later gave me a wet nightmare, I fucked up so bad having fapped in my sleep to a videogame game over, this unfortunately got me addicted to VideoGame game overs which is the game equivalent of hentai and there's countless videos of this kind in YouTube that go by a specific Japanese name that I wish not to speak of. In 2012 (15 years old) I found out about porn by my sworn brother who Said that it's normal to watch it and fap, and at first I started to watch normal stuff, you know couples, then because of that wet nightmare back then my subconscious sent me intrusive thoughts and because of the addiction I fell into both hentai and bdsm, God forgive me for what I've done, I wish I could bleach my brain because I have seen things that will shock your eyelids, despite my addiction I have lines I won't cross, but good grief even if I have stopped watching bdsm I'm still watching normal couples and that fucking hentai bulls hit, it's annoying how addictive this stuff is, I failed yesterday after keeping it under control for 3 days You guys/Gals are my only hope for breaking this addiction, bless you all and fight on</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I am not an atheist, I will never be one of them, I'm afraid to read the Bible in fear of losing my faith, I only light candles and say prayers and praise The Trinity but especially God The Father, I can't stand spending more than a few minutes in church, call me a heathen or a heretic or whatever it Is, don't judge me, I truly love God The Father And Our Lord and The Holy Spirit and I can't do anything else to get close to Them but pray and when I am able, help people, I even joined nofap to keep my sin at bay so that I can stop and grow closer to God, but it still feels like God has left me to die to my sins, it's only natural I would throw a tantrum in this sub, especially since I can't read the Bible because of atheists scaring me that I will lose my faith, I'm just afraid and sad. for all these years I felt God's presence even if I sinned and begged for forgiveness, I was never one to help every homeless and hungry person I saw in sight but I always prayed and still I do, and I help them whenever I can, if that makes me a bad Christian then I can't do anything else but accept my fate,but now when I pray it feels like I'm speaking to myself, it's like God has created a wall around me so no one not even Him can hear my cries or see me because I'm just like Esau , the only thing ive ever wanted was to be a son of God, but it seems God chooses who He wants to be saved and who to give up on, and now atheists have taken away a very important part of my faith, they have turned me against the Bible out of fear that I'm going to lose the only thing I live for. Hate me all you like, I'm just a broken man</TEXT>

    <TEXT>First of all it's called addiction for a reason, once you start it becomes nearly impossible to stop, it's willful only in the sense that sexual thoughts overtake your mind and you can't think clearly and you do it, but once you do it you realize you fucked up and disappointed and angered God and then the bad thoughts say that God hates you because you fapped and you don't deserve His love and you won't be saved, this sends you down a catastrophic spiral of sinning the sorrow and self loathing away, but sorrow and self loathing become even worse, your relationship with God Is ruined on that point and you can't find a way out and people condemn you to hell for your addiction Second, you who condemn us and call us fake Christians and devil spawn because we are addicted to fapping, you are not sinless and you are not holier than us so you have no right to throw the rocks of hatred and hellfire</TEXT>

    <TEXT>1st of all, I want to talk to a priest about my problems but I don't think they care because no one has said when I'm in church that confession is available and I can't just go ask a priest for confession because I don't know how they will respond 2nd I'll post my problems here so if there's an orthodox priest please talk to me Here we go:1st of all, to spare my family becoming sad and burdened with my sadness I keep it all locked in and I can't cry anymore just to spare them the pain but I fear my lifespan has been shortened due to my sadness, I hope my lifespan is restored after sadness leaves otherwise I'm doomed. 2nd for 8 years I'm officially addicted to porn and fapping due to my sworn brother believing it's natural, but after I commited that sin and I got addicted death of loved ones followed which I don't know if it's God's punishment or not 3rd and second most important, I'm fighting against my darkest self, I don't know Who I truly am, when I'm home alone I hate the way this world has fallen into sin and fallen away from God's way and I'm afraid of the alpha male toxicity and descent into violence that exists in this generation, but when I am outside and see people that aren't that bad in terms of personality and attitude or even if they are, my loving and caring side surfaces although I still have a hint of fear when outside, I don't know Who I truly am, only God completes me Which brings me to the most important point, when I try to fight my darkest self, it says in my mind that I'm all alone, that I deserve to be alone and I deserve the worst and that I'm a mistake God didn't intend and that for my sins I'm going to oblivion, that I'm worse than the devil and imperfect for heaven, the worst thing is I agree with my darkest side here, and thus I'm ashamed and because of my selfloathing I can't face God and Our Lord and ask Them for help because I feel like I don't deserve Their love and help and mercy and salvation, so I fight against my darkest self on my own and I get even more devastated because without God's help I'm nothing And finally, because of the state of the world full of atheists and hatred and mocking against Christianity and saying that they turned atheist because they read the Bible and they thought it a fairy tail, my mind strays from God and I forget the most important thing while trying to approach Him and get His attention, I forget that Our Lord existed, taught God's word and love, sacrificed Himself and resurrected so we could be saved, when I doubt even Him I research and scholars confirm that when Our Lord taught He really existed and they also say that He was crucified, and my belief comes back but then I struggle with God because I'm not perfect and I don't deserve His love and mercy and I fear that I can't be saved and I'm getting stuck in a horrible loop</TEXT>

    <DATE>2020-08-02 09:16:56</DATE>
    <TEXT>What if three people who don't exist in the universe's records, say they are an anomaly or from another universe or dimension, what if they make changes In the past, present and future to stop a hypothetical object that exists in all three instances from causing untold catastrophy, will there still be consequences even if they don't exist in the universe's records? In more simple words, can an outside cause that changes things in our universe do so without repercussions because they are not supposed to exist in our universe? P. S. This has nothing to do with dark, I noticed the similarities in my post too but there's a more personal reason why I ask that</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I can't help every homeless in my country because I belong in the low - mid classes and I live with my parents on a small budget relying on what I can make from work and from my family's pension as well as some help from relatives , my family and me are believers in God The Father, Our Lord Jesus Christ The Son of God and Our Saviour and in The Holy Spirit, but we don't attend to church or read the Bible but we do light candles, pray a lot, like seriously this, our belief and trying to help whenever we can and being good, kind, loving and caring to others is all we do that aligns with God's will, so don't say that I don't do works and I don't try to change , when you are in the low-mid classes and live in a country with a messed up economy like Greece and with the coronavirus around, it's difficult to follow your faith to the max, if I were absolutely rich I would do anything in my power to help the poor and homeless but I can't do much when I'm in this situation so don't judge me. Stop with the hating on others in this sub because they are not perfect , I know I'm a sinner too and I want to stop it but that doesn't make you saints and holy people because you condemn me, I've gotten a lot of hate from you guys and I can't stand it.</TEXT>

    <DATE>2020-08-08 12:42:50</DATE>
    <TEXT>1st)I don't go to church to stay for the liturgy because I find it irritating to stay for a long time, I only light candles and pray personally and I keep everything, between me, God and Our Lord and The Holy Spirit and I leave. 2nd)I can't help every homeless I see in front of me, I'm too scared to help them and I freak out when someone or me are in a difficult situation, I freeze and walk away unless I see that they are in genuine need of help, most people are dangerous and only want money, I can't provide them that, if that makes me a horrible person in the eyes of God then so be it. 3rd) I don't read the Bible except for verses and when I do read parts of it that relate to my situation I understand what they are saying, as for the contradictions i did research and they are easily explainable and are either not contradictions or they are metaphors and parables or people are getting confused due to translation errors and besides atheists say that they lost belief because they read the entire Bible so I'm scared to fully read it but i understand what it says and can tell the difference between metaphors, parables and literarism. 4th)I believe in God The Father, Our Lord Jesus Christ The Son of God and Our Saviour Who sacrificed Himself and resurrected in order to be saved and enter God's family and I believe in The Holy Spirit the one that resides within us and can help us tell the difference between right and wrong and it helps us reach God's family by putting us on the right path 5th) I've witnessed miracles both small and big in the past and sometimes in the present and because I have an analytical mind when I find it hard to believe I see what atheists and science have to say and I see what Christianity, the Bible and my experiences in the past have to say and if they are explained by science then it's fine by me, if they can only be explained by Christianity and the Bible then my faith become stronger, now do I have doubts? Yeah I do because of my sin (fapping) I have been separated from God and because people here say that in order to be saved you must go to church every day all day, you must pray without ceasing, you must be baptized in water, you must be perfect and sinless you must be out on the streets and shout the gospel, I am dissuaded from following God and Our Lord and The Holy Spirit because I feel unworthy and abominable because I just can't live up to these standards 6th)The only things that I do and am able to do is to pray a lot and beg for forgiveness, and for God to be by everyone's side and to guide them and the souls of the departed to His kingdom and family and I praise The Trinity, also prayer is done away from everyone else because I believe that Our faith is personal between us and The Trinity, I help people in need whenever I get over my fear of people and I try my best to make everyone happy and to be genuinely kind and loving to everyone, I can't do anything else except these three things, also when I do good deeds I do them out of my heart and when I go home or after I do something good I pray to God The Father in The Name of Our Lord for forgiveness for my being a horrible person, and unworthy of His love and mercy because of my sin addiction. I do good deeds because I want and then I pray to God for forgiveness and mercy because I want to mend our relationship and I want to be a part of His family so I won't be alone and broken anymore And finally 7th)I can't understand why you call me selfish, I put. God, family and friends first and I almost never care for myself, I play video games, listen to music, write stories and do other stuff because I enjoy them but they never take God's place, why shouldn't I have thoughts about everything and have feelings and wants of my own? Why must I think and care only about God and doing everything Christian for the rest of my life? Why can't I be free to enjoy games, music, and friends and long for a relationship while putting God first? Why Is this considered selfish?</TEXT>

    <DATE>2020-08-08 23:05:49</DATE>
    <TEXT>My throat becomes shore and I can't breathe in and the doctors insist that I'm perfectly fine and my lungs and oxygen intake are normal, but ever since 2012 even during the day whenever I focus on my body function I have to breathe manually, but its more apparent at night, when I woke up this morning I wasn't breathing from the mouth at all and was only breathing steadily through the nose, I can't breathe through the nose normally because when I breathe through the nose I feel my throat dry and shore and it prevents me from taking a full breath, it feels as if God is trying to kill me every night because He is tired of me fapping but hesitates so that I should live my life with shortness of breath in guilt as punishment</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Not of the word, of the world, if I'm antisocial and afraid of it I can only be kind and caring enough and try to make others happy and I can't help every homeless or poor I see because many are dangerous and are drug addicts and because I'm struggling with fapping and porn I fear God won't forgive me and I can only gain His love by believing in Him, Our Lord and The Holy Spirit, and doing good deeds, but im also deathly afraid of God because He chooses who is saved in the end and I doubt someone who struggles with sin can enter His family and Kingdom so I feel I'm already a lost cause</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Yes I believe in God The Father, Our Lord and The Holy Spirit and I believe in what Our Lord taught and I believe in his sacrifice and resurrection so that we can enter God's family and Kingdom, but for 8 or 9 years or even before I started watching porn I've been addicted to fapping due to a wet nightmare I had when I was little and I fear that because I can't stop the addiction I have to do good deeds in order to compensate for my failure and in a way by doing good deeds and believing I will be able to stop sinning like that and become a better Christian and person, but I was horribly bullied in the past for 3 entire years and by people I once Called friends, and it scarred me for life, I have trouble trusting people and considering the crime rate in my city is high and most are homeless with needle holes and ask for money I don't know who to help</TEXT>

    <TITLE>The quote I most relate to in my life this year is from stu pickles (yes I'm a 23/24 male and I wouldn't say no to rewatching rugrats) "I have lost control of my life" bonus pts for being 4 am where I live</TITLE>
    <DATE>2020-08-10 01:24:22</DATE>
    <TEXT>This quote describes me nowadays completely, I've fallen into sin, I hate myself, I worry about not leaving my mark behind before my time is up, my self hatred causes me to think that God and Our Lord have abandoned me and want nothing to do with me because I'm a filthy sinner and it prevents me from following Them completely because I think I'm unworthy and God is quick to anger , I fear the world because I was bullied in the past and our crime rates are high and most homeless are dangerous and addicts and those who are genuine end up being greedy and won't accept food or water only money, and we have already reported them to the mayor's office but they Refus help because it doesn't live up to their standards, in other words I am a messed up person that can't stop fapping and my relationship with God and Our Lord is ruined and I feel unforgivable.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>When I was young I was eating a lot and became overweight, after I moved to my new home a few years ago I started caring for myself and now I'm normal but my abdominal area is untrained and I am a bit circular there and it's causing me to have a very low self esteem and because I was bullied in the past because of both my normal looks, and my overweightness and for unknown reasons, I fear that everyone thinks about me like that One day I was telling a friend that girls only like muscular and toxicly masculine bullies who show off and they won't look at me because I'm kind and caring and because I'm fat(yes I still think that having a circular abdominal area is the same as being fat) and then an overweight couple around my age appeared and me and my friend are like wtf?! Then he said, God Himself is telling you to cut the bs by sending them your way to show That even if you have a circular abdomen you can still find a girlfriend, you just lack self esteem Also I don't know how to flirt and I don't want to be extrovert because I relate it to popular condescending bullies and I'm afraid to talk to girls because I fear that they won't even want me as a friend</TEXT>

    <TITLE>Forgive me catholic brethren but from what I've seen from comments here I come to believe that you have a superiority and chosen ones complex, I don't know it feels like you look down on non catholics and you have serious works based salvation beliefs</TITLE>

    <TEXT>It's like you can only be saved if you go to church every day, get baptized in water, be sinless and perfect, you are too judgemental of others who sin and come here and embarrass themselves for their sin and regret it while asking for your advice, you put Lady Mary on a higher regard than God, I get it she was the mother of Our Lord and that puts her in an extremely high position since basically she could be considered the closest thing that God The Father has to a wife, now this last point came from a little bit of a personal place because I have trouble believing that we don't cease to exist until judgment day and come back only if God wishes so, Again I apologize for this, just my thoughts feel free to correct me of any misunderstanding</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I can't go to church, I can't help everyone I see but I try to help whoever is truly in need, I pray 3.5/4 of the day and because I fear teens and young adults these days due to the survival of the fittest mindset that has been indoctrinated into them, I stay home and spend time with my family, pray to God The Father in The Name of Our Lord, listen to music, play game and write stories, I can't get over my fear of people because most of the world proves me right that they are a generation of bullies and thus I can't help everyone every day, and I fear that God has no use for me and doesn't want me in His life because I can't live up to His standards and because I'm not sinless and addicted to fapping which is too difficult to stop because it's a part of my body that Is difficult to ignore once you become addicted I'm a disappointment to God and I feel like He has turned His back on me forever,He could strike me down at any given moment but I guess He doesn't because He wants me to live in order for me to see everyone I love die so I can pay for my sins and leave this life with regrets</TEXT>

    <TITLE>After a convo I had with my mother yesterday and seeing something that can only be explained as evidence for Christianity I decide to put all my love, faith and trust in God The Father And Our Lord Jesus Christ and The Holy Spirit</TITLE>
    <DATE>2020-08-16 11:47:14</DATE>
    <TEXT>I respect Lady Mary The Theotokos immensely , but I don't pray to her, instead I opt to pray directly to God The Father in The Name of Our Lord Jesus Christ and ask for The Holy Spirit to guide me back to Them, and because of the soul sleep/non-existence until resurrection belief I have a few doubts that saints can answer prayers so I trust in God more instead of praying to saints, better safe than sorry, apologies if you are triggered by this. Okay a little backstory, for years after my father died my psychological and spiritual world were crushed, at first I believed that God took my father away due to my addiction to fapping, then my mind became critical and I found it more difficult to believe without physical evidence, though I did have experiences from time to time because God knew my faith was fading and He wanted me to follow the path He set for me, but soon after I would doubt my experiences again, and for a long time I was on the verge of breaking and God always found a way to bring me back, after that my experience with the supernatural has toned down a lot and I fear that im deemed unworthy of being Christian because I don't have experiences, my mother told me that's not true and it doesn't make people who have experiences more special or saved than us and that I shouldn't ask for proof and just trust in God . Anyways after our convo, she found a video of a female lieutenant who had survived a horrific chopper accident and that she called upon Lady Mary and that she saved her and that time passed within seconds and she was saved by the E. S. And she was told in the E. R. That it would take years to recover completely but it only took her two months to go back to normal, people in greece are very religious and believe and many have had experiences with the supernatural(by that I mean that they have Christian experiences) my mother also had a vision of Our Lord once, unfortunately I haven't had any visions in my life and I fear that this means I'm unworthy in God's eyes, anyways I may have second thoughts about my former stance on the saints but now I can't deny God and Our Lord and The Holy Spirit's existence and I have decided to trust in Them and believe without needing further evidence P. S. Yes I also have had spiritual experiences but not visions, God sends messages in many ways to confirm His existence to those who start to lose faith and to let them know that He is always there for them and to guide them back home P.S. 2. The lieutenant told the interviewer that Lady Mary told her that in exchange for saving her life, she was to tell everyone that our faith is true and that God and Our Lord are always by our side and in our time of need and that our faith saves us. P.s. 3. I know that you'll say to take everything with a grain of sand (?) but everything that has happened to me and my family so far and other people's experiences and because people who were in accidents became believers after their accidents has led me to conclude that Christianity is the real deal P. S. 4 my selfishness and self loathing have been reduced to zero now after yesterday's convo and witness God bless you and your families and do what you can to live a normal Christian life and keep God and Our Lord and The Holy Spirit in your minds, I also love every single one of you as my brethren, I'm a man by the way</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Don't hate me for this but this is my first fire emblem game, I've played the old ones on an emulator website but I'm pretty noobish, anyways any tips for me on how to play fire emblem three houses? I'm playing on normal, I want Dorothea to become a myrmidon and then a sword master and to support her with Bernadetta also I made the idiotic mistake of focusing only on Hubert, Dorothea and Bernadetta and only have them in battle and on my last playthrough Dorothea was massacred on classic in the bandits mission at the start, any ideas on how to make her a myrmidon that doesn't die in two hits?</TEXT>

    <DATE>2020-08-27 18:05:37</DATE>
    <TEXT>I'm 23/24 male and when I was 15 I lost my father, then my godfather died, then my grandfather and my uncle, I am the youngest sole survivor of my Kin, my Godfather's brother, aka my other uncle, is the only other man who carries my kin's surname and he is very old now, my sisters carry the surname too but I am the semi-last man in the family and I don't have a girlfriend, wife or kids to leave behind when my time is up, the world has been cruel to me and I find it difficult to speak with girls because I don't know what they will say, I'm average looking, I hate myself, I try to be as better a person as I can, my faith is the most important thing in my life, but I fear I'm not good enough for either God nor anyone else in this life, I'm a horrible monster that shouldn't have been created, I believe that God didn't intend for me to exist(although my mother would disagree because I was the only child that survived birth) and that I was an accident of my father, I have failed my father, I have failed God just for existing, I've been in dangerous situations and I have come out alive, my sworn brother is the one who is in danger and I'm alive and well, why? Does God hate me so that He would curse me like Cain to outlive everyone I care for? It doesn't matter, my time is running out, Greece and Turkey are on the verge of an all out war and I doubt God will want me to live because of my sin addiction, so I guess I will be unfortunate, get killed in the war and I will end up in either non-existence for my sins or I'll end up in hell for all I've done, I have survived all this time because I'm very careful and fearful and I fear that this is breaking God's will for me because I truly believe that God doesn't want me to live and he takes away my loved once as punishment for my carefulness. I'm Greek by the way and no I'm not suicidal,I love my mother, my stepfather and my stepsister and my sworn brother too much to hurt them with cowardish</TEXT>

    <TEXT>"you don't have a Bible and you don't read it but pray nearly all day for guidance and forgiveness and you try to live as Christian as you can? Still not enough, you don't read the Bible and don't stay for the mass/liturgy and on top of that you still sin, you are definitely going to hell and you're unsaved See?! This is exactly how you sound like,its making me feel hopeless that I am not good enough for God and that I have to do all of this, and not just pray and try to live a Christian life as best as I can because it's not enough for God, I can't read the Bible because I don't have one, second it's in ancient Greek and I suck bad in ancient Greek and I don't know Jewish or more importantly Aramaic(capitalizing because it was Our Lord and Saviour's dialect)so I can't understand anything, and also I'm afraid that if I read the Bible i either won't understand it or I will lose my faith, a theologian acquaintance from boot camp lost his faith in God entirely after boot camp though I have to admit he was unwell mentally and he became something I think is called universalist(someone who believes that the universe is sentient and make its own choices and that it's cruel and horrible just for the atheistic lulz Anyways this is why I prefer to follow God and Our Lord from experience, because in the end when I see Bible verses that appear the moment i need them most and micro experiences with little miracles here and there strengthen my faith without having to read the Bible</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I believe in God The Father And Our Lord Jesus Christ and The Holy Spirit but whenever I went to church in the past I could never stay sitting or standing there for hours and listening to the liturgy, it always drove me insane so I just lit candles, prayed and left, it's a habit I haven't grown out of yet, my only knowledge of Christianity comes from the religion class and when I learned about Our Lord, His teachings and sacrifice and resurrection I instantly believed and became a Christian, I've struggled throughout my life with my faith and because I don't read the Bible I rely on my experiences and my prayers to God and He always answers at His own time, when I asked Him why did He cause my bro's accident I learned later that it was my bro who was drunk and didn't wear a helmet that crashed his bike, meaning that It wasn't God punishing me for fapping. Anyways back to the point of this post, when I was in junior high school I was brutally bullied by nearly the entire school just for the hell of it because they took my original bully's side and most of them were people I called friends in elementary, that's why for years until I finished junior high I stayed home after school and played video games, after I finished junior high and up till now I can only trust and hang out with a select few people but when I can't hang out with anyone I go to church and Light candles and pray And then go back home because I don't trust people and fear that everyone I see is a bully and that they'll mock me , that's the only time I can help the poor and I go out of my way to help them but I can't do it all the time, I'm also afraid of spreading the gospel because in my country I believe they can sue you for harassment or annoyance and because this world likes beating people up I might end up In the hospital or murdered and buried 6 feet under, also Most people here are atheists or LGBT or even both so no point in spreading the gospel to them. Now you can judge and hate me all you want</TEXT>

I don't take them as bad because I'm a casual but why would a pro take them seriously? P. S.

    <DATE>2020-09-19 00:22:32</DATE>
    <TEXT>I was bullied in junior high school which made me extremely introverted and I'm afraid of everyone I see outside and so I can't spread the gospel because they will immediately become hostile, in my country the biggest percentage of homeless are drug addicts who want only money most people in my country suffer from toxic masculinity and have become gangsters, drug dealers, drug abusers, domestic abusers so the streets in the crowded and mixed races parts of town and the city are highly dangerous, teenagers gang up on people their age and above and send them to hospitals, even in my city I see kids, teens and young adults having been brainwashed by the survival of the fittest and toxic masculinity mentality and I'm afraid of everyone I mostly trust in God and Our Lord and The Holy Spirit to guide me and the only things I know of the Bible come from my own research and from this reddit, also I can never stay in church for a long time but I always pray to God and when I don't know what to say to Him I just think about Him all the time and I pray that I trust, love and ask for His guidance Alas this Is not enough for God and Our Lord and The Holy Spirit and I will be erased from existence once I die because I've been made lukewarm Important points, this toxic masculinity thing started slowly in few parts of my country but it spread throughout the entire continent/country (forgive my English, I'm Greek and sometimes I confuse definitions and think they are the same) like wildfire and now everywhere I look 90+% of the teens is alpha males and females, i am terrified to go out because I feel like an alien, I don't belong near these people. As for the homeless i do help whenever I can but not everyday and everyone, but I'm not doing enough and God has unleashed His wrath on me for both sinning and not doing enough. My life really sucks, my sinning brings misfortune and death to everyone I love and I wouldn't be surprised if my constant fap ping addiction is responsible for all the death and misfortune and destruction going on in Greece, I have God's wrath and hatred it seems to me Please don't be too judgemental Also we are getting a new and stricter lock down</TEXT>

    <TEXT>If I'm a Greek Christian Orthodox will I still go to heaven or do I deserve to go to hell because I'm not catholic? I have been begging God In The Name of Our Lord for forgiveness and for the Holy Spirit to guide me for 9 entire years and ever since last year my prayers are about God giving my blood brother a second chance in life and to survive the struggle, the question is, if I keep begging Him will either of my prayers be answered? Or is there no chance and I'm forsaken? I finally downloaded the Greek Orthodox Bible and because my brother is having the dangerous head surgery within the week, if I grow closer to God and I'm obedient, will He answer my and my family's and my brother's family's prayers for his survival? Please don't hate and no I'm not considering God a genie and I trust Him as much as I can because my brother's fate regardless of our prayers always lied on God's hands and only if He wishes He will save him but still we all want him to survive, is that so bad?</TEXT>

    <DATE>2020-09-22 18:59:19</DATE>
    <TEXT>We called my best friend's mother a few minutes ago and she said that the doctors are fatalistic/pessimistic about my best friend's survival during surgery and they say they'll do their best but the decision is up to God, it's shameful to see such an advance in technology especially in the medical department and for the danger of death still persisting, what if God hates me and my best friend and his family and He doesn't want to save him? We pray, we beg, but it's all for nothing, God doesn't care because it's not His Will for my bro to survive, tomorrow he is heading to the ER to have the head surgery and because God is silent and cruel to those who need Him and love Him and need him in both good and bad times my fears seem to be real, either He doesn't exist, either He hates me, or He willingly kills people to teach others lessons and to have them focus on Him and only Him When people die I hear, God wanted them back, it was God's will, He wanted for an angel to come back to heaven, God works in mysterious ways and we are not to judge, there is a chance that my bro will survive the surgery but in the end everything is up to God, it's just a pity for a 25 year old man who just started getting his life back together to do a stupid mistake and be in this situation for 11 months and now the only way to move forward is an already taken decision that might end one of two ways. Please don't hate me, all this I'm saying is because of fear and grief, grief that God might not Hear my family's, his family's and my prayers for my best friend's survival, it's like He hates me and wants me to suffer</TEXT>

    <DATE>2020-09-22 23:47:39</DATE>
    <TEXT>My best friend(25 ) crashed his bike 11 months ago and didn't wear a helmet so he was rushed to the emergency room to treat his injuries, he was treated during the duration of his medical coma but he had hydrocephalus, thus he was unable to react, while at the hospital they performed spinal surgery to improve his health due to a bone being dislocated near his lungs and they also performed a head surgery to remove the water from his brain, but this is worrying, he contracted post-surgical meningitis and it damaged his brain and the hydrocephalus still persisted, four months ago he was taken home and his family cared for him and his health improved, the only problem is in the brain, they Called a professional neurosurgeon a month ago and he told them that his body was strong enough to undergo the head surgery to improve his health and give him another shot at life but of course there is always the risk of dying, he is going to perform the operation early morning today (it's nearly 3 o'clock in the morning in Greece ) and I'm afraid because the doctors were pessimistic yesterday about the success of the surgery and there's no turning back now So my question is, what is the cause of mortality of a head surgery? And what factor does meningitis play in the survival of a head surgery?</TEXT>

Much less an entire Bible and people back then weren't too literate so its obvious why it would take that long, also how do you know that events that transpired when Our Lord was alone In the desert weren't told by Our Lord to the disciples to write everything He said down? I believe in His existence, His teachings, crucifixion and resurrection due to experiences suspiciously lining up perfectly with what Our Lord taught and did in the Bible, you don't want to believe that's fine but don't go snooping around here trying to find vulnerable victims to try and convert them, saying that the Bible is not trustworthy and probably fiction is belittling Christianity and trying to prove us wrong</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I'm 23 male turning 24 on December, I'm in an academy that has different classes and I am on second and final grade of I.T., so today as per country tradition we were blessed by a priest and we were to meet our teacher but we don't have one at the moment so we were dismissed, now before I move on to the main issue at hand, I'm extremely socially awkward because I was a victim of extreme bullying in the past and people I called friends took the bully's side and looked down on me, mocked me, hit me, I was and I still am very unpopular with girls, one day my sworn brother told me to prove my manhood by telling a random girl that she was beautiful and I went ahead and told her and she responded like I was the most horrible creature she ever saw,now I'm normal looking, I'm 1,81 cm tall, I did have a problem with obesity back then but I'm now getting better on that department but still the stigma remains and I can't stop fearing that my abdominal fat is the reason why I can't have a girlfriend, anyways these extreme experiences have made me way too inexperienced with girls and I always fear that I will creep them out if I say hello or that they will judge me for my looks or that they will be flat out hostile because I'm not cool and fit and alpha and thus I will be blocked out of potential love interests Now back to the topic at hand, the girl that piqued my interest is normal looking, thin, quiet, she wears glasses, she looks very nervous and reclusive and I saw her today without any friends and she didn't join any classes that went to their respective classrooms and this makes me think of two things, either she didn't pay attention to the respective teachers of the classes or she is a first grade I.T. Student and thus doesn't have a teacher either, I was fucking stupid and too socially awkward that I couldn't muster up the courage to ask her about her class because I was afraid that I would creep her out and just went home , I'm not creepy just deathly shy and I don't know how to start a conversation or keep it when I start it, like really I fucking suck at this, any advice? I'm seriously a lost cause if I keep on like this</TEXT>

    <TITLE>To atheists, why don't you consider nonbiblical sources of Our Lord Jesus Christ The Son of God's existence, exile, teachings and death at the cross as proof? When i'm about to lose my faith I experience miracles that bring me back, that's why I believe in The resurrection and in God.</TITLE>
    <DATE>2020-10-08 00:32:43</DATE>
    <TEXT>It's proven by nonbiblical sources that Our(yes I'm a communist) Lord existed, they just don't agree on the miracles, and resurrection, miracles that can only be explained by the Bible and knowing that Our Lord existed fuel my faith and bring me back to God, well I pray a lot and beg for forgiveness and guidance and to save me from my unbelief obviously so it's obvious why God would help me get back on His road, also please don't judge me or mock me or insult me for my faith, I've been on the edge of the atheist cliff and ready to fall off to my spiritual/existential death, way too many times than I would like to admit, so I guess i know how you feel, but even during my doubting I pray and beg for forgiveness and guidance (aka have faith) so that could be why God helps me I hope may this post convince you that not all Christians are judgemental and evil and evangelicals, and maybe try to pray and have faith and ask God to show you the way</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Just to make something clear, I'm incapable to read the Bible because I will not understand it or In the worst case scenario I will lose my faith, and faith, God,Our Lord and The Holy Spirit are the only ones I have to keep me going, if I lose that I might as well go off myself, now, I rely solely on God The Father, Our Lord and The Holy Spirit to guide me,the moment I learned about God and Our Lord and The Holy Spirit at school in religious studies, I instantly believed, I read back then everything and I believed, here in Greece teachers don't give two fucks most of the time, including religious studies teachers so they didn't brainwash me into Christianity, I chose to believe on my own and because I have little understanding and knowledge of the Bible I rely on God and He has always pulled through, without God's help my family and I would never have this peaceful life we have now, were there hardships? Yes but it all works out for the best in the end, the point is I always trusted God and He never led me wrong,I don't rely on the Bible and when something happens I cross-reference it to what it says in the Bible, I look up to what science has to say but in the end Christianity and God explain it at all, also why belittle my belief? Just because you don't believe in God doesn't make mine or other people's Christian experiences Invalid, also science is manmade a person's soul and spiritual world are Godmade, you can't invalidate analyzed experiences</TEXT>

Well that's the case, when in doubt I pray and wait for a sign, that sign comes and its always for the better, when something I want doesn't happen God always sends me something my way that's better than what I asked Pray and you shall receive, God works for what's best for us</TEXT>

    <TEXT>No they become atheists because they have been mistreated and because they go in the Bible with a closed and literal mind and ready to prove their Christian fundamentalist evangelical abusers wrong,that's why I trust in God first and if I happen upon a miracle I then confide in the Bible to see what it says and if it's not in the Bible it's a coincidence and explainable by science, that's fine too but there are miracles that can only be explained by God and the Bible and I truly believe that Its bleak looking at the world without God, in the first place, at least to me, what's the point if you just cease to exist? Why think and have life experiences if they don't matter at all, if you die and you cease to exist then they will be all for naught, the universe will cease to exist one day and that will be the end of that, no recollection of ever existing, no one will remember you, no one will exist, the entire fucking universe will cease to exist, it will be as If nothing ever happened and will stop happening forever Because there is confirmation that Our Lord existed and lived in exile and taught and died in that Era , and it lines up with the Bible and because of spiritual experiences and because of faith I believe it If you ask a question don't ask it in a condescending manner acting like a fedora atheist That is intellectually superior to stupid religious people "But they encroach on us who don't believe so often that we can't sit in silence "don't put everyone in the same box because you have been mistreated, I'm not afraid to tell you why I believe and I don't try to convert you, I just tell you my beliefs and why I believe and you decide what to believe and what not, I know my experiences and I cross-referenced them with the Bible, other believers experiences and even analyzed them and I still came to the conclusion about my faith and my experiences being valid You follow science just as I follow God, you are just here to convert me to atheism and science, it's not going to happen, it's a bleak world, hell even if I'm a Christian I'm pessimistic and even nihilistic considering myself and my falling into sin and inability to forgive myself and move on and try to follow God's path, I believe there's hope for others and not for me because I'm an abomination, but still science is the god of this world and people are following it blindly and proudly, creation against the Creator Who only wants what's the best for His creations and children in this fallen world, how far we have fallen, science created the atom bombs just because they can, the nazi scientists performed horrible experiments on people, the CERN wants to create a black hole and recreate the creation of the universe just to test their limits uncaring of people's health, all this money could be used to feed poor people and third world countries but no they fund scientists to disprove Christianity and to prove we are godless, pointless, and that we don't need God At least some churches do use their money and supplies to support the poor, instead of paying billions in weapons and universal research they should pay more for benefits of humanity</TEXT>

    <TEXT> gt;spent fearing that God is in full force out to get me for my sins by hurting both me and my loved ones directly and indirectly You'll find a lot more truth in the above direction than thinking God only loves and cares for you, quite frankly. God actually hates us all, but tolerates us. We all die because of sin. And we don't die because God loves us. The heart is deceitful, above all things. So as we stare out at the night sky into the vastness of creation, just remember, right there in your own chest thumps the most deceitful thing in the entirety of the universe and of all creation. Nice thoughts, huh? But you see, we are so deceived and soooo over the top in love with our own sorry hides, that we'll at least forgive, overlook and excuse our sorry selves every.single.time. in Gods Name, of course. I'm actually quite in love with Gods Hatred of me, because it's definitely due. Imagine that? I love to hear killers state publicly that they deserve to die because of their crimes. These are the most honest people on earth. Just like the thief on the cross, stating that he deserved to die because of their crimes. That man went to paradise with Jesus, because he was TRUTHFUL. Such a rare thing. Look at Jacob. The guy was a thief. A robber. Dressed up in goat skin no less and essentially deceived his father Isaac, and stole his brothers blessing. Now ask yourself, WHY would God bless such a lying deceiving thief??? The answer might occur to a few, because...wait for it... **He was telling the truth about himself.** DING!</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I was playing dark souls remastered earlier and I noticed that the scimitar and the killing edge look identical, is the killing edge based on the scimitar? And since swordmasters in awakening use a killing edge that looks like a katana and katanas are trademark of ancient Japan and samurai and ninjas, does that make Middle Eastern scimitar users, ninjas or samurai?</TEXT>

    <TITLE>I'm sick and tired of hearing, God works in mysterious ways, or he wanted an angel back in heaven,or probably our suffering is God's punishment or its for a greater cause, and even worse is this one, We shouldn't doubt God's justice, His actions are justified.</TITLE>

    <TEXT>So my father died because it was God's plan or punishment for my sins or because God wanted an angel back in heaven? Sure it did lead me and my family towards a better future but the losses we suffered along the way mean that I am the semi last of my Kin, I need to find a wife and have kids before God strikes me down just because He works in mysterious ways, He wanted to send a demon back to hell, which then makes me a hell spawn, a hell spawn that fell away due to tragedy, as divine retribution for my sins, for a greater cause so that my family and the entire world can live a peaceful without me here bringing destruction and death.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Yeah I noticed that too, due to the post's title I wanted to add all these words in the same sentence and it came out as an incomprehensible mess Tl;Dr my birth was a result of my parents bypassing God's will somehow and I was born without a soul because I'm not a creation of God, my existence is so abominable that God is infuriated at me, or so I think, because my father and most of my Kin from my father's side died and a few more loses along the way I believe all this and people say that everything is God's will and He is in control of everything and that we shouldn't judge His actions because He is God and He can do anything He wants</TEXT>

    <TEXT>For starters I'm working until 14:35, second my supervisors are on a strike and I'm all alone and prone to making mistakes, they have me on phone watch(picking up the calls) and I'm infamous for my social awkwardness and my supervisor told me that if a specific coworker calls I am to tell him that he is on strike, long story short he wanted to rest today and because I saw his computer at work turned on and I saw him working I doubted that he was on strike and Thought I hear wrong, so when the coworker called I told him that he was working from home today and that caused the coworker to assign him work because he thought he was working, first face-palm, second face-palm, I was called by my division's manager to send a permission to HQ protocol division , but the thing is I am not allowed upstairs in HQ without my supervisors calling the lobby to let me in and because I had no supervisors today I just went to HQ Yolo without asking my manager to call for permission, which makes the next part even worse, because I am a very obedient person when it comes to authority and my manager is the highest ranking member in our division , I immediately said I would take it to protocol now, but when I left I forgot I never asked him if I were to bring the protocol number back or if I should leave it there, so when I reached the lobby my stupid ass and the security guard thought that it was just to be sent at protocol and that they would take it there This is the biggest mistake I've ever done today, not bringing the protocol number back and the second mistake is accidentally sending work to my striker supervisors because of a misunderstanding, thankfully I will go tomorrow to get the protocol number but I fear I will be arrested because my manager chewed the HQ lobby out badly for not allowing employees from a different division but from the same employer, into HQ. Anyways the point is this day is very horrible, anything that can go wrong will go wrong if God wills it and considering my best friend is in constant danger due to his post-surgical condition I fear that God will do something awful in order for me to develop,even though I havent sinned for one and a half days and I always beg for forgiveness and guidance, I fear He will punish my loved ones for my sins because I'm unforgivable</TEXT>

    <TITLE>I just came back from work and stopped by the church to light candles and say my prayers, while I was praying to God The Father in The Name of Our Lord I was on the verge of breaking down in tears but I couldn't, and instead of a happy feeling it was one of guilt, regret, sadness and fear</TITLE>

    <TEXT>Ever since I started sinning(fapping) back in 2011/2012 and my Kin dropping like flies and taking it as a punishment of hatred by God I realized I'm a horrible person and an abhorrent sinner and creature, and that I deserve every bad thing happening to me because God is justified in hating, abhorring and punishing me because my soul is corrupted from birth, I try my best to follow God and Our Lord and what They taught and trying to help people in need whenever I can and can afford, but it feels like God's heart has already been made and I'm not part of His plan or will, my thinking is that He will be overjoyed when I die because I'm an abomination that interferes with His will and plan, now I'm not saying I will commit suicide, I'm not that weak, I will probably die of stress and sadness because of God's hatred and wrath towards me, in either case there's no escape from my fate, I'm fated to live without God's love and presence and I'm fated to be erased from existence after my death ever since my creation, when I pray all I get is unbearable psychological pain that is slowly killing me, that is a sign that God hates me eternally For those asking there were no priests in the church at this hour, only a few broken hearted believers praying and lighting candles</TEXT>

    <TEXT>When I was 14 I started officially fapping because my sworn brother said it was normal and even if he as a Christian did it, trust me, if you fap, retribution for this unforgivable sin follows, He killed my father and godfather the year after and even though we were led to a better place to live and start our lives again, then my stepfather's father died after a year since we moved and my addiction became worse, then after I finished boot camp in 2017 my addiction started again and I couldn't control it so God gave my uncle(my stepfather's brother) liver cancer and he died in 2018 and now last year September 26 or 28 my sworn brother got drunk and didn't wear a helmet and crashed his bike and I fear it was God's retribution for my unforgivable sin, ever since then I'm suffering psychologically and any moment of happiness is reduced to thinking, what is God going to take away from me now? My sworn brother is alive FYI as far as I know, we haven't got news in two days but it could be that his parents are too busy with their works and taking care of him to pick up the phone, I just spend all my life in fear of what this short time of happiness is going to cost me after the time is up, I truly believe God has something against me and all this misfortune happens to my life, it's like I'm in n the first place of His s**t list, it's like He is actively out for my blood and to take revenge on me for even existing</TEXT>
