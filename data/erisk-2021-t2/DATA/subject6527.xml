    <TEXT>Surround yourself with people that think differently than you. This helped me realise that disagreeing with someone doesn't have to mean disliking them. That sounds incredibly obvious when written down, but I didn't realise how similar everyone I surrounded myself with was. Whether it be about "small" things like music taste, or "big" things like religion. I've forced myself to take the time to see more perspectives and ask more questions, theres a lot of similarities between myself and people I usually wouldn't think I'd end up calling my mates. This also helped because people would challenge me on what I thought/liked/whatever - why do I think like I do? Like what I do? I didn't think about that often when (most) people around me were incredibly similar to me.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Yup, she had skin cancer on her ears so they cut them off. We adopted her from the SPCA and she had just had them removed, apparently it's quite common in white cats? Poor things.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>When I was younger and working a retail job, I was trying to help a deaf customer order some items we didn't have in store, and she wasn't very good with technology so online ordering wasn't ideal. I tried to tell her that phone orders are an option... I even did a phone gesture with my hand and put it up to my ears... Luckily she had a wee laugh, but I was mortified. It was just so robotic that when we didn't have things in stock, I would run through solutions. Online, phone order, store transfer... I was only 16 or 17 at the time and I remember being so embarrassed for the rest of the day.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>When people use something of mine and don't put it back in the original place it was. Even if it's from my desk, and they put it back on my desk but not in the right place... It drives me insane. I don't say anything because going "it was on the LEFT side, not the RIGHT" is incredibly stupid, but I silently fume over it.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I was diamond and I'm hoping I place there again, but I don't play as consistently as I used to so fingers crossed... The enemy team was very very aggressive, so I was quite literally only healing the whole time (unless I needed juice on Moira, or trying to land big nades on Ana during ult fights). My tanks were getting pressured hard, so smart healing orbs and using my coal almost as soon as I got it every single time to keep them up definitely helped. It was a super fun game to play.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Hahaha yeah that's very true! There's a hilariously big difference between those stats... Luckily my tanks and DPS were smacking, I was definitely just in 100% heal mode - spraying my yellow juice like: ( #65417; #9685; #12526; #9685;) #65417;*: #65381; #65439; #10023;</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I live on an island and I don't know what I was expecting a border to look like, but it wasn't like this. It's so... obvious. I thought maybe empty land? But they've built right up until the border. Interesting.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I'm from NZ - there's a lot wrong here. Our domestic violence, child poverty, and suicide rates are very high. The cost of living here is also high. I appreciate that we seem to do a fair few things "right" here, but there's also a lot wrong. Like everywhere else in the world, there's good and bad. We also fuck sheep.  #8203; Thanks.</TEXT>
