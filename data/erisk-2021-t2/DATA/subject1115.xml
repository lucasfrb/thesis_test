    <TEXT>I was at my school library today and i noticed someone forgot their usb. I figured I could do a little detective work and hopefully put a name to the usb. Not only did i put a name but also a face. I contact Anon through it's email to schedule a time and place to return the usb. At first Anon sent multiple messages to my email asking questions and changing the date of the meet and also talking about how the usb holds sensitive info that can ruin it's life. Now anon has threatened me saying it will go to the police because i might have copied this so called info. Anon thinks i might ruin her life but in reality she is about to destroy mine. Moral is, don't waste your time being the good guy because you may lose what little you have.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>This dude "lives" across the street from me. He lives with his sister/wife/cousin (i don't know what the relationship the have). Every time he's here, there's a problem with parking and he's here constantly. The car he drives isn't registered to this state. Mind you he lives across the street, but he parks on the opposite side. There is fucking more. The lady that he lives with doesn't usually park in her driveway or in front of her house. She parks in front of the house next to hers. You might think, "So what?". The way she parks, she takes up 2 fucking spaces. On top of that, the space in front of her house, she uses a trash can to reserve the spot for her kids(?). There's an old lady that lives next door and I understand why she would do it, but the house that has the trouble parkers have too many cars to the house. On top of that there's a girl that lives with them, daughter maybe? She seems pretty cool in general, but when she has friends over, for fucks sake.These guys are morons. When they come to pick her up, guess what? Double fuckin parking and when they do park, it's half assed, 4 fucking miles away from the goddamn curb. The least they can fucking do is put on their hazards. Edit*- ramble rage. and punctuation...and probable misuse of "there, their and they're."</TEXT>

    <TITLE>Apologize to me?</TITLE>
    <DATE>2013-12-08 06:09:43</DATE>
    <TEXT>I live with my parents and brother. I am 20 years old and that's a problem. I'm too broke to move away so i have no choice but to stay. I don't talk to anyone and i'm fine with that but my parents think that's a problem. One night while i was asleep i was woken up by the guy across the street who thought it was a good idea to go to his car back and forth unlocking and re locking his car. Probably taking something out that couldn't wait. After he's finish with what he's doing, i manage to fall asleep but am woken up again by my brother who thought it was a good idea to cut his hair. Awesome. Fast forward...probably and hour... i hear him walking back and forth, so i get out of bed walk up behind him and give him a shove, he falls, makes a loud thud parents wake up. To sum up what happened in the next 30 mins: i have to apologize and shave my beard and i have to read the bible more. Then they go about how i never talk to them so i bottle everything up until i apparently can't handle it anymore. heh, that's funny. so let's figure out what the hell is wrong with me. back when i was little anytime i got in trouble, i'd get beat. usually with plastic hangers. anytime i had to show my dad my math homework and i had something wrong, i'd get yelled at and beat or had to kneel on my knees for an hour. this happened from 1st to 8th grade, during the school year. off season, i had to work with these text books cause...i was just too stupid it seems. anytime i got in trouble, my parents would make fun of me cause it would apparently make me to better my self. another problem i apparently have, is that i don't smile enough. they think i have some emotional problem, i think it's cause i'm pretty self conscious of my extremely crooked teeth. when high school rolled around, i found out how much of a bitch my mom turned out to be. according to my mom, the high school i chose to go to was a low performance school cause the building just happened to be in the projects. any friends i made, according to my mom was a drug user/dealer or affiliated with a gang. freshman year of high school at a parent/teacher meeting, my mom asked my math teacher what she taught and told her that she thought the school was low performance. the look on my teachers face... i swear she was about to attack my mom. and i think she deserves it. Fast forward, i graduate with a a scholarship. College rolls around and i'm left alone. fast forward to this summer, i get a job delivering newspapers. not the best, but it's something. after a few months i'm forced to quit cause going on vacation with my family is really important. Funny thing, all the money i made, i lost cause of my parents. i literally left more broke than i did going in. vacation time. fly out to our destination and my dad is driving. like a fuckin asshole. we get to the hotel late at night, i think about 2 in the morning,and by 6 we have to be up cause according to my dad," we have to see all the things." the amount of stop signs and red lights he drove through, i swear to god, i honestly thought i was going to die. at one point i screamed at him to brake because if i hadn't he would have caused a massive pile up. enough about me and my parents, lets talk about what my brother does. he's always annoyed me and i don't mean nag. he's went to far. and it's because of my parents. he is babied.he has no common sense. two examples: one day he comes home form school and leaves again and he doesn't come back until about 10:30 pm. parent freak out and shit and later on that day they all laugh and shit. the next time he leaves the house at about 2 am and doesn't come back till 5:30 am. when asked about where he was he say's he's at school. he isn't really considerate and doesn't really understand the consequences he may cause. long story short, i'm the problem. maybe my dad shouldn't have kicked me down the stairs. maybe i'd be more talkative if my parents actually listened. or maybe i a crazy and belong in a psych ward.</TEXT>

    <TITLE>Pros and Cons of consistent short vs. long distant driving.</TITLE>
    <DATE>2014-02-12 23:31:48</DATE>
    <TEXT>For clarification i mean; for 6 days out of the week i drive about 60 miles (from home to work and back home) a day. my father on the other hand only drives about 4 miles in total 5 days a week (home to work back home). so what would be the pros and cons of both situations on the vehicles? Note- we both have are own vehicles and the miles are maybe 5 or so miles off, you know, stopping by a store or grabbing lunch or something) edit* sentence structure *edit 2- I am wondering about my case. as u/sky4 stated the negatives of low mile drives and u/cptboring kind of explained the positives of long distance driving, I am wondering about the negatives of long distances? i drive to and from work a little over 60 miles a day, 6 days a week. other than spending a good chunk of money on fuel what are other concerns i should worry about? *note 2- it's nearly midnight and i'm too tired to link any usernames or proofread what I just typed. I don't see to many red underlines so I assume I didn't do too bad.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I've been working at a hyundai dealership since the beginning of January. But about a month and a half ago allergy season started. It's not the fact that I have allergies, but that ever since i got the job they're worse than they've ever been. I've narrowed it down to the general location of where my allergies are at its worst- in the shop. If i go outside or anywhere else away from the building it calms down a bit. So what i'm asking is: Does anyone else face a similar problem, or my even know what's causing it?</TEXT>

I'm not talking about regular maintenance, but more of, "this specific car comes into the shop and for some reason similar vehicles have the same concern", type of thing. I do at least 60 miles worth of driving (highway) 6 days out of the week. the biggest problem I had with the car was that when I would use the wipers the headlights wouldn't turn off for about a minute. My car only has about 15k, but i was just wondering, unless its too soon to say.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>It's about a girl. At work. I met her a few months back and the first conversation we had I decided that we were going to be friends. We traded phone numbers and we talk quite a bit. Nothing personal, just random shit. But for some reason my brain decides that I have to have a crush on her. Great. But something happened and now I don't anymore. Don't get me wrong, this girl is the type you'd marry, I'm not thinking about it or anything but I'm just saying this is that one relationship I can not fuck up. To the creepy part. I know what car she drives. Ever since I met her, that similar vehicle is everywhere. Same make, model, year but different colors. It probably is a common car but I notice that fucking thing way more now. That's not the only creepy thing. She knows the area of where I live. And she brought it up. For the record, Neither of us ever mentioned our residence to each other. But she brought it up and started naming all her relatives living in what neighborhoods. This is a great girl, I like her and I have love for her. I'm just hoping I'm paranoid and reading in to it too much.</TEXT>

    <TITLE>Dealership politics advice</TITLE>
    <DATE>2014-06-08 23:07:55</DATE>
    <TEXT>I work as an express tech for a dealership. All i do is LOF's, tires very very light repair work and up-sells ( cabin, air, wiper blades, etc). that means I get paid hourly, which was great mainly because I just don't have the experience or even feel comfortable enough to do anything else. Here's where the politics part comes in. I just found out, this past Wednesday, that I will be going flat-rate. I will now be paid for the work I do. There is no way I can make a half decent living just doing oil changes, tires and up-sells. On top of that, the dealership I work at has been going through some dry spell. There is barely any work for the higher up techs. You have experienced technicians with at least 20 years of experience doing pdi's for new cars. Those only are worth maybe an hour or so's pay. If the more experienced techs are doing work to get by, what am I going to do? Is what the dealership doing even legal?</TEXT>

    <TEXT>It's about relationships for me fellas, sorry, I just had to put this somewhere. I think I figured about a part of my self. And I've given it a lot of thought. I'm damned to be alone. The facts: I work 6 days out of the week working more than 11 hours of the day. The one day off i have I spend treating myself to a lunch, going to the movies and then afterwards going to the comc book store. This pattern has been like this for weeks. you might be thinking, " Why the fuck do I do this every week?" I work 6 days out of the week from sun up to sun down and I've gotten used to the working conditions. And one day off I have, I spend by my self...alone. Which sucks, a lot. I tried out online dating, but no luck. And I've tried out multiple sites and no luck. Probably cause I'm not very photogenic. Or that interesting. So what do I do? Yeah there are plenty of fish in the sea, but I don't think any of them want to be with me. I'm damned to be alone. Life, prove me wrong.</TEXT>

    <DATE>2014-10-12 13:50:53</DATE>
    <TEXT>I was doing a simple oil change on a 2013 MKS. First car of the day, the lift is set up, I go to open the hood. Normal shit. Then I take toil cap off and put it on the hinge where the hood release is, like I always do. That's when it went down hill. The oil cap manged to slip through the little gap where the hinge was and it was right behind the grille. Because it's a newer car you can't just stick your hand down to reach it. So I bring the car up to take of the front splash guard hoping I can come in from the bottom and grab it. Bad idea. The radiator fan is way to big and in the way for me to reach it. That's when I talk to some of the more experienced techs to see what they think I should do. They all came up with the same idea, I have to take the front bumper off. Remember it's a new car, that means I have to disconnect sensors and headlights to get that off. Fuck. I had an idea, I went to parts to see if they had an oil cap in stock. Nope. Fuck. Idea number 2, take it off a new car and have one ordered to come in the next day. All the similar cars have their doors locked and the keys aren't available. Fuuuck. Good news an aftermarket cap is coming in half an hour. So I button shit up and start doing what I should have done a while ago. Cap comes in and the car is sent to wash. The team leader says to bring the car back in to get the original cap. Goddamn it, but he's has a point. Car come back in. One of the guys has an idea. Move the cap to the far end of the car towards the wheel. Took that sides wheel off, took the fender cover off and stuck an arm through to grab it. Fuck yeah. Button shit up again send that piece of shit out. It's not happy ever after. I find left over screws on my box. Not one or two, multiple. Fuuuuuuuccccccccccccccckkkkkkkkkk. I know I tightened everything down, so I have no idea where they came from. I'm probably going to get fired. Goddamnit. Time to look for a new job.</TEXT>

Everyday that I go there I see the same girl and she keeps asking if I'm going to talk to her. Maybe i'm stupid. I just get in get out. So I say to her, "What do want me to say?" Then she goes off asking what my problem was and if I don't like girls. The fuck? I paid, got my change and was ready to leave then I decided on something. I walked back to the counter and hold out my hand. We shake and introduce ourselves. Is this how this girl is? Does she happen to like me, or am I just reading too much into it?</TEXT>

    <TEXT>What I do for a living has its high and low points. The work I do is decent. I run into problems, things don't the way it should, whatever. But it's the people that usually cause the low points. People borrow things from me then return it damaged saying,"ohh you should buy better quality shit so this doesn't happen." Oh yeah? Or, " Is your shit broken?" Dude, they break it and make it my own fault it happened. You know what their excuse is? " I helped you out so we're even." That's a great trade off. Better yet, they return it damaged and not even tell me. Then act like nothings wrong, reassuring themselves that it wasn't their fault to begin with. Fuck me for spending money for shit I need. I get blamed for being slow. Which is funny cause I have some shit luck. If, what appears to be a simple job comes in, I have to waste my time dealing with the shit the last guy fucked up, or what the customer has done. The manager comes in, " It's a fifteen minute job, what the fucks taking so long?!?!" My rebuttal, " Oh I don't know, this plastic piece of shit is welded to that fuckin wire.  lt; lt;*( Real story) And everything else is warped on." Another thing, people I work with. They just keep saying shit to me. It's one thing to bust my balls, but when you keep going at it and you keep saying the same shit over and over, it kind of gets old. I don't stand up for my self. What's the point? If I speak up for myself, then I'm a problem. All I can do is bite my tongue. They say i'm a good guy. For what? Not saying anything back at them? Get this, the same people that keep fucking with me, wants me to help them. I can't make money doing their jobs, and they know that. I'm wasting my time helping them out and I'm not sure there's anything I can do about it.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>[Original Post](http://www.reddit.com/r/socialanxiety/comments/2j239d/a_girl_i_see_everyday) I'm too nervous to talk to her. So, somehow I came up with an idea. I asked a female coworker to be my wing man. I may or may not regret this decision. This may be the best or the worst idea. What the fuck am I doing?</TEXT>

    <TITLE>There was a lost kid at the mall.</TITLE>
    <DATE>2014-10-17 00:32:54</DATE>
    <TEXT>I was at the mall, by myself and I heard a kid call for his mom. I heard him but all I could do was keep on walking. Don't get me wrong, I wanted to go to the kid and help him find his parent, but I couldn't. I'm a random guy, walking by myself and all I could do was ignore him. Let's be honest, if I was to go and help him, I would be labeled as a kidnapper or child molester. All because I'm a guy. If i was a girl, or was with a girl then I could help. But I'm not and I wasn't. I looked back though. Looked like people were just walking around the kid. I tried to look for some security, but I couldn't find any. Fuck. So I just walked away. This happened about a month ago. I'm sure the kid was reunited with his folks, and he may have gotten yelled at/ hit however his parents are, then they carried on with their lives. Shit, they might have forgotten about the incident all together. But I haven't. Because I'm a guy, who couldn't help a kid. Because of social standards. Because I was too selfish in thinking about my own well being rather than somebody else, especially at the fact that they couldn't help themselves. Because I didn't want to be falsely labeled because I wanted to be a good guy. Fuck.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>So, I have a decent sized beard and all but it came with a little bit of a price. Dry skin underneath, which leads to dandruff. So, I went around a few stores looking for beard oil and no luck. But I did invest in [this](http://www.target.com/p/burt-s-bees-hand-salve-3-oz/-/A-12834909?ref=tgt_adv_XSG10001 amp;AFID=google_pla_df amp;LNM=12834909 amp;CPNG=Health+Beauty amp;kpid=12834909 amp;LID=17pgs amp;ci_src=17588969 amp;ci_sku=12834909 amp;kpid=12834909 amp;gclid=Cj0KEQjwiJiiBRDh3Z-ctPfS5MgBEiQAAlkbQqQXv21RRgMubYYkYnknTdRtzW-PFqVe7CksYXPg9fIaAk8W8P8HAQ). I applied some to my beard and it made it shiny, but I think that's about it. Be honest, should I stop or does this stuff work?</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I've been thinking about this for a while. I just wanted to trim up my cheeks. So I went to a place at a mall and when to the barber place there. I told the guy what I wanted and he said he had to trim up the sides of my head to make it match. I said ok and it went down hill from there. He then went to work on my beard and I told him I just wanted my cheeks shaped up. I told him to leave everything below my jawline alone. But he didn't and what was left was like a mohawk thing under my chin. I had three months of growth gone because I didn't have the balls to tell him to stop. When it was time to pay, I almost just walked out because I was in such disbelief of what just happened. I still kind of have a beard but it disproportionally outlines my face. I'm not shaving, so I'll just have to wait for it to grow some length again.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>[Update 2](http://www.reddit.com/r/socialanxiety/comments/2jguos/a_girl_i_see_everyday_update/) I know it's been quite awhile since my last post because I only get to see her for like a minute a day. But I told her I like her, kind of. I went in to grab a drink (at this point I don't even want a drink, I just want to go and see her) and when I went up to her she made the gesture of her lips are sealed. I've had a hard time talking to her and she's pretty much calling me out on it. So I tell her that I've been working speaking to people. Then I tell her I had a problem. She still didn't say anything so I just kept going. I told her there was this girl I liked but I didn't know too much about her. The only thing I really knew about her was something specific implying it was her. For example I said, " I got a problem. There's this girl I like but I don't know too much about her. The only thing I do know about her is that she has pink-rimmed glasses" She replied with, "Shut up." She smiled when she said it, so I think I got that going for me.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I just drove my dad's corolla to the deli which is a couple of miles away. I make a couple of right turns and I hear a low squeaking sound. Kind of like when a cv joint is going bad.

Might not even be the first one either. Have any of you gone through something similar? thanks in advance.</TEXT>

The one day off consists of my regular weekly routine: wake up, do laundry, go out to lunch, go to the movies, handle any errands and enjoy a drive. I think its ok to have a day to myself. I'm content with where I am at the moment, it could be way better but I don't think it can go down. I think this is my lowest point.</TEXT>

    <TITLE>Saw an old acquaintance for high school.</TITLE>
    <DATE>2015-08-17 22:52:52</DATE>
    <TEXT>It sucks where I work. Everything is close enough to walk but it's just far that you want to drive. I choose not to cause i'm not going to waste gas just because I'm lazy. It takes me about 5 minutes to walk to a fast food place but it's closed cause there's a power issue.,Now I have to walk all the way back to the corner deli which I just walked past. I go in, place my order and happen to notice a familiar face. He doesn't look any different from high school (about 5 years ago). I'm debating on if I should say something. I wasn't but then again it wouldn't hurt. I say hello and I know he doesn't recognize me, at least, not right away. I don't bother re introducing myself. We just had a small talk. It's just short sentences, three words at a time exchanged. I start remembering what he was like. Always had a way with words, always had funny comments/comebacks. Said everything with confidence. I guess he still had it. "I can't complain." is what he kept repeating. It just sounded like he was trying to convince himself. Then I paid for my stuff and walked away.</TEXT>

    <DATE>2015-10-03 23:35:21</DATE>
    <TEXT>I was on craigslist and I found an ad for a '91 camry a guy is trying to sell. He provided quite a few photos (inside, outside, under the hood) and it looks pretty good, he even posted the VIN. I have to say, it does not look bad. Here's the thing that urks me. It's the description of it. "The car, in general, is in a good condition. In particular, front lower control arms may need to change sometime in future, but it is not necessary as of now. Still runs perfect. And it will still drive thousands of mile without touching it. Same I can say about lower ball joints, they still run perfect but since it makes some noise you may change it sometime in future. Front sway bar bushings may be also changed in future. Everything else, including, most importantly, the motor and transmission works perfect. Works smooth. Guaranteed. No oil leaks from below the car." What do you guys think?</TEXT>

    <TITLE>Honda Accord 1993</TITLE>
    <DATE>2015-10-13 00:55:44</DATE>
    <TEXT>[this](https://newyork.craigslist.org/stn/cto/5244704049.html) is the ad. Now it clearly states that it is in mint condition and I went to see the vehicle. Honestly, it looks pretty good for a 93. It does have its leaks and it does have rust spots, normal, but there's one thing the ad failed to mention. There is a big crack maybe a few inches above the wipers that go across. I tried negotiating the price to $800. I came up with that price because when I talked to some honda guys they said that a windshield usually goes for $150 at a junkyard and I figured an extra 50 bucks for labor (most likely underselling it). When I told the guy the price he said he wanted $1000 dollars firm and I asked him if he was at least going to replace it. No response. Other than the windshield, the car looks pretty good. I'm not hell bent on getting this car, but I won't lie and say i'm not interested. I guess what I'm trying to ask is, should I still pursue? These are a couple of [pictures](http://imgur.com/cvspg9U,T6j2HFm,0lkC8Ie) I took, sorry they're not clear.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Long story short, joined a gym near me, walk in and go to the weight room. look around and see a whole wad of weird ass machines. Ask around, get referred to a trainer (duhh), go to the front desk and find out none are available. I should mention it's like 5:30 ish in the morning because that's the only time I'm free to go. Leave my contact info for the guy and he says somebody will call me later. No calls all day. I just want to know how to use them. New York Sports club if it matters. Right now I only want to focus on using machines and then after a month start using free weights.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>[Take a gander at this](http://www.driversedguru.com/driving-articles/car-auto-maintenance/always-set-the-parking-brake/). There are multiple web pages about supposing to use the parking brake. Yes the trans has an internal park, using the parking brake relieves some of the stress of the whole vehicle weight to the trans and the motor mounts, etc. Everything wears when you use it. When you use that brake, a few clicks in and feel if its catching. If you've been pushing it to the floor for some time, maybe you should go someplace to get it readjusted or at least inspected</TEXT>

    <TITLE>Low volume brake squeal only in Reverse. (coming to a stop) 2013 toyota highlander fWD 3.5l worried how serious this may be.</TITLE>
    <DATE>2016-08-13 02:58:16</DATE>
    <TEXT>So...I replaced my own front pads and rotors about a month ago using OEM pads and rotors. (Dealer got ~$500 parts and labor for rear pads and rotors). I started noticing very low volume squeals when I'm backing into a parking spot. I asked some guys from my own shop and they said it's most likely the parking brake shoes, even though I kept saying i keep hearing it from the front, they still said it's the parking brake shoes moving around. That diagnoses makes no sense. I know i'm rambling, I apologize. What I remember doing: Replaced pads and rotors. Cleaned bracket, loosened up upper and lower slider pins on both sides, regreased, reset caliper, installed rotor and put lug on to hold in place. put bracket tightened with 1/2 gun on and greased clips. Installed new pads ( I think they were interchangeable, not sure I honestly don't remember.) Installed new holder clip things for the pads and put on caliper, tightened with 1/4 rachet and socket. Any ideas on what to look out for incase it's not obvious.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>People take advantage of this. I'm usually the first one in and the last one to leave. Why? Because there is so much work to be done. Why is there so much work to be done? Because other people don't want to work. You want to know something? I don't mind working. My body has gotten used to it. I can keep moving all day. "You've gotta eat something..." No I fucking don't. I'll take a break when there's no more work. Is there no more work? Nope. Two occasions I remember clearly, two different people decided I was going to do some personal work for them. They both know I'm busy as it is, do they go to someone else? Nope. I am the only one that *has* to do it and they guilt me into it when I tell them I can't. No lunch time for me. About lunch...I haven't had lunch this past month as far as I remember...and that includes sneaking food into my mouth whenever I can throughout the days. There are some people telling me i should leave early and I'm just like, "for what?" I tell them I have nobody waiting for me, so what do I honestly care? Shit, the only reason they talk to me at all is either to throw their work on me or to feel better about themselves. I'll take all the work and I won't ever ask for help unless I absolutely need it. While people take advantage of me, I'll just keep getting better and better. I don't have anyone to hang out with, I have no shoulder to cry on, I've got no one to call. I just live to work shooter, let's keep it that way.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>For a long time I wanted to be in a relationship and then I was, only for a little while. Maybe it's me, maybe it was the girl I was with at the time, maybe both, I don't want to be in another relationship. The first day I was with her, it was really nice, but then the next day and the next past and I slowly lost interest. I thought that if I stuck with it, it could work itself out and I just made it so I was wasting both our times. That's my problem, that's why I don't even have a friend to call once in awhile. I lose interest too quickly in people. For me, what sucks being alone is I don't have anyone to consult with on the decisions I make and 7/10 I make a bad call. Yes I want to be in a relationship, yes I want to have friends, but at this very moment with the way I think, it may not be for the best.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I have the same problem. The safest thing to do is to shit talk them. (I work on cars and there's a Chatty Cathy here, a lady that works as a cashier or whatever that walks through the shop bragging and shit about whatever.) Example: "I am sooo excited this weekend cause I'm going to the shooting range and firing a 9mm" " a 9mm? What kind of 9mm? I've got 1/4 inch socket, 9mm open-ended wrench, 9mm open ended ratcheting wrench..." I keep going and going. The trick is to keep talking. Any time she tries to say something, raise your voice and keep going on about whatever you're rambling about. She will leave, she will not bother you and the best part? You'll get a laugh.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I've had my heart broken a couple of times and at this point I've lost interest in relationships and in people. I don't have much experience in a healthy relationship, so I'll tell you what I'd want. Communication, trust and interest. Communication: talking to each other. I'd assume everyone's an adult, how about talking about concerns regardless of who's wrong or right? Trust: person a and b are two different people deciding that they want to spend part or the rest of their life together. Both of these people have their own friends, hobbies, jobs, etc. a person can't control the other, who are they to do that? All they can do is trust the other in that they'll do whatever it is they think is right. Interest: a guy takes a girl on a date, pays for dinner and then calls it a night. This goes on for three more times, yet the girl doesn't seem to bother trying or even showing interest. Guy starts to feel used and leaves. But if the girl offers to make dinner, treat the guy to something, so on, it'll work out. Those three things are what I think is the base of a healthy relationship, I've got no idea what's up with the verbal abuse you've got going on in your relationships</TEXT>

I do work fulltime but the inly way ill be financially satisfied is if I take on a part time job and thats seeming to be the hardest thing for me to find. I cant go back to school because I'll be in way too deep of debt and ive got no clue if ill ever come back out of it. Ive been wanting to enlist in the coast guard for a while but I've got nasty acne all over my back. Sounds like a stupid excuse really</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I'm still guessing its the harmonic balancer and nothing to do with your tires at all. The thing with going to another dealer is they rather not work on a vehicle that wasn't purchased there. I'm not saying they wont take a look at your car, they just assume you won't be back. You're going to have to look at dealerrater.com for any other nissan spats that arent too far. You'll probably have way better luck with an independent shop though.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>As a mechanic, buying name brand tools. A simple wrench set with the name "snap on" is worth a couple of hundred bucks, yet a gearwrench set that has more wrenches in said set is worth about $150. A decent tool box is maybe $5000-$15000. If someone needs to have their own scan tool it can vary from about $100-$10,000 or so. I'm 24 and I live at home, the money I make right now, I cant afford tool, personal car repairs and rent. I'm almost okay with tools, but living near new york city, rent is a bit high. There was a room that was offered for about $500, I go to view and it's a bit bigger than harry potters cupboard from the first movie. My biggest struggle is finding a part time job, nobody wants to hire someone already full time that works during the day. I feel getting a part time job will help a lot in paying for a place to stay, bills, etc.</TEXT>

    <DATE>2017-07-11 02:19:38</DATE>
    <TEXT>My car has aboit 68,xxx miles on it and I've never done any type of maintence service to my transmission. The condition of my trans fluid is still red but its starting to get darker and on top of that there's a bit of a bad smell coming from the dipstick. The maintence book says I never have to service the transmission because its a life time fluid, but I plan on keeping the vehicle well past 200k. I would very much like to do a service to my transmission, but I have a major concern: at very low speeds, especially on hills, it clunks from first to second gear. When I mean hill, it is very steep. A very particular hill that I have to drive through has a stop sign at the top, that's where the "clunk" happens. It also happens if I shift from drive to reverse quickly if I need to reverse into a spot. What is running through my head is what if, after the tune up, my transmission ends up worse? I dont know if me trying to maintain my vehicle will actually cause more problems</TEXT>

    <TEXT>You have to understand how a dealership works. Mazda dealers usually only work on mazda 99% of the time. They have to follow proper procedures as per mazda the manufacturer. And yeah, dealers have to make money too. They will start with a diag charge, then it will go into a repair charge, as per how mazda the manufacturer deems fit. You can go to a local shop and ask them to update your pcm but chances are, they want to diag it properly too. For shits and giggles, lets say the update doesnt fix the problem or makes it worse, not only does that repair shop look like a fool but now the customer has to pay more money.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>School is just a part of life, maybe small or maybe a big impact. It all depends on what you make of it. Don't forget that there is a world outside of school. If you're allowed to roam around the town then go for it. Become a regular at a coffee shop or a bookstore or something. Solely visit a place just to say hi to somebody. Yeah, school can be a tough place, just always have something else to look forward to. And most importantly, always have a place to vent.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I remember when I was in elementary school maybe 16 or so years ago ( second grade) it was Christmas. The teacher had everyone put little decorated lunch bags under the chalk board with everyone's name on it and the class had to pass out little cards. I spent the whole night with my parents making cards for about 30 other kids and I passed them all out to each bag the next day. Come time to get the bags, I look in and I didn't get a single card. I played it off but that really did hurt.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I was working at a dealership a couple of years ago. A new building was built after the previous owner passed but the old building was still up. So, to accommodate more cars on the lot the old building had to come down. The dealership hired a contracting company and they hired some cheap laborers to knock it down. It was a very cold day, it might have snowed, I don't know. I hear a lot of sirens, way more than usual. Turns out. That old building collapsed and one of those workers was in it. And to this day, the guys' family puts up candles of where it happened. Dude left behind wife and kids.</TEXT>

My only goal right now is to find a part-time job just so my time is filled. I already work full-time but it's barely enough. Renting alone is too much, I couldn't afford it. I have to live with my parents. I have a few thousand saved up solely because I have nothing to spend it on. I could move to a different location sure, but I'll just be making the same mistakes over and over again. I could go to school, but not only do I know I won't be able to pay the debt, I don't know how I'm going to survive (I am not close with my parents), I don't even know what I should even go to school for. I feel like I'm supposed to be doing more but I don't know what that is or even where to look. I am just lost.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Looks like I've got your only answer, just let it warm up and go easy on the throttle until it happens all the time. I could be really wrong but I feel like it might be your turbo. I'm kind of in something similar, may car makes a popping sound while accelerating on turns at low speeds. Only in those conditions no matter what the weather is like and until the problem gets worse, I don't know what's actually causing it.</TEXT>

    <TITLE>Traditional IRA or no</TITLE>
    <DATE>2018-02-10 02:22:00</DATE>
    <TEXT>For 2017 I worked at three different jobs and my w2s came in all in the same week so I went to get my taxes filed as soon as I could. Turns out I didn't actually get one of the w2s but something for health insurance and the one I needed came a week after I filed my taxes. Now I have to get my taxes amended and have to pay my state about $750 in total. I can pay that no problem and I can get that money back in about a months time. But my tax person suggested to me that I should go to a bank and open up a traditional IRA for 2017. If I put $4,000 into it I can get about $30 back. Here's the thing, it took me about a year to save that much in the first place. And I can definitely open one up and put that amount in there. The way I see it, it's a lose-lose situation. I'm looking at short and long term. One hand, I lose about 1/3 of my tax return but can gain that back but what's the actual benefit of an ira besides a possible return?</TEXT>

    <TITLE>Popping sound heard/felt in steering wheel when accelerating and reversing. 2013 Toyota highlander fwd, original suspension no mods.</TITLE>
    <DATE>2018-02-25 13:20:21</DATE>
    <TEXT>I feel it when I steer when making lefts and rights, forward or reverse. It happens when the steering wheel is at 9-10 o'clock and at 3 o'clock. Originally I felt it only when I'd be reversing anytime I'm backing in/parallel parking. I've looked at the suspension underneath, nothing looks broken and I don't feel play when shaking the wheels. Any ideas on how to narrow it down? Edit: nothing over bumps, and no popping when I turn the wheel lock to lock when the car is parked.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Its actually happening right now, or currently. (Not to me) This guy I work with is in a long-term pre-nub (8 years) with this girl, they have two kids and they all live in the girls dads' house. The girl handles a lot of the financial stuff (bills, savings, etc) and the guy actually makes that money. Usually the girl comes to visit him at work multiple times a week, they have lunch, etc, whatever. If you saw these two together you would never guess they would ever want to be in a relationship together. As far as I know the guy smokes weed (maybe more) and the girl is a slob. Seriously, comes in with greased stained shirts, overweight/out of shape. There's another girl (the guys' friend) that needed help getting a car. The guy helps her get a used Mercedes coupe. They hook up and now she comes by often. Often enough to the point the side chick and main girl almost bumped into eachother multiple times. I'm just hanging out seeing how this will play out.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>People give me attention because they don't like the fact that I do my own thing. I don't mean I do cool shit on my own time, I work a full and part time job so I don't have time for much. I guess people don't like the fact that most of the time I don't need them or get involved with whatever things they're doing. For instance, I can be in my work area doing my job job and the guy next to me is hanging out with his friend then all of a sudden, they call my name. I just answer with an absent-minded "yeah" because I'm really not pay attention to them. Or another good example: some needs my help that turns out to be a real pretty girl, I don't have the social capability to converse with them so I just do whatever it is they need me to do. But that's hard to do because multiple guys start leeching out to talk to this girl and they all know what they're doing, so now I can't get the job that has to be done completed.</TEXT>

    <DATE>2018-03-27 02:09:42</DATE>
    <TEXT>I'm not really look for help, I just can't really think straight right now. I was supposed to go to a truck shop as a helper, actually supposed to start today. I called Saturday to let the employer know that I'm ready to work and that I haven't changed my mind. He the tells me I'm actually not working there at all...even though he clearly asked me when I could start and when to come in. I gave my previous employer a notice so I'm not on bad terms but I get the news on my last day that I won't be having a job on monday. I asked my soon to be employer if I'm even going to be given a chance at all and he tells me to come in Monday (today) so we can talk. I go in and he starts telling me my offer was forfeited because I asked what kind of work week I'd be having because I already have a part-time job where I work during the day. I told him that I could easily adjust to the schedule he needed me to have but he took it as a low-level person making demands. He then tells me he already hired another helper and will call me later. This was said to me at 9am and he calls me 7:30 at night to say I don't have a position. Luckily a tool provider has enough respect for that he's willing to help me get another job. I told him last week where I was going and he started freaking out saying he'll find me another job and that this Trucking place is not where I want to be. I understand this isn't the right sub-reddit to post this in but I feel it's the most appropriate.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Last Saturday was my last day that at a job. I've been there nearly a year and found a place where I'd be an apprentice. I got hired earlier in the week and was supposed to start this monday. I asked my new employer for a schedule because as I stated to him, I have a part-time job where one day of the week I'm working an afternoon (4 other days I work nights). My part-time job is adjusted to my former schedule and it's flexible where I can switch my days. The new employer took it as my old job is too comfortable to leave and that I shouldn't be making demands. I found out he was thinking this on Saturday after I told him that I haven't changed my mind and am looking forward to working for him. He says to not come in, originally I thought he was saying the job is closed that day. Nope. He tells me he's going with someone else and that I should stay at my old job. I told him that I already put in my notice and that come Monday it appears I won't have a job at all. He then says to come in for a talk. I come in and he goes, "I shouldn't be making demands especially for days off before I even start working." I tell him I wasn't making any demands and that I just wanted to know what schedule he planned out so I can make an adjustment for my part-time job. He then tells me I didn't specify that even though at the interview I told him multiple times that I had one and we had a conversation dedicated to that. Long story short: i have no interest in working for this guy anymore. So, since Monday on I've been out of a job. ( I still have my other job and that's the only thing financially keeping me afloat). I've been going to about 2-3 interviews a day and all not interested. Yesterday an interview was set up for me by a person I work with at a different company for a place that I've been wanting to work for. My previous job is like a city college and the place I want to work at is an ivy league (so to speak). I could go back to my previous employer and get my job back. I am not on bad terms with them, yesterday afternoon I received multiple messages on my phone from various people saying that I've got to come back. Apparently the head boss was also wanting me back too. The reason why I don't want to go back is partially because I'm embarrassed of the events that happened on Saturday and Sunday. Back to the place I want to work at, they spoke to me as if I'm hired and that my employment will be discussed at their daily meeting. Which I hate because I want official confirmation especially over employment. I'm supposed to get a call today. I have no idea if it's 5 minutes from now or later on.... I just don't know and I'm excessively nervous. TL;DR: am I hired or not dammit??? I can't wait no more</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I have a blue collar job, what would be my best bet for finding the best health insurance for me? I'm looking for something that covers health, dental and vision. I'm 25 years old and I don't have any major health problems but I think in 10 years I will. I figure it's better for me to find health insurance on my own because either employers don't provide or if they do, the plans are too expensive to the point it's hard to pay for bills.</TEXT>

Two months later, no shave, beard is a lot more noticeable but unfortunately it's very patchy at the cheeks, thin in the chin area and the mustache doesn't connect. Should this guy that wants to grow a full beard get discouraged and shave it all off? No, because it takes multiple trim sessions to make this patchy, non-connecting beard the best version of itself.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>You could try and go to a dealership first. Every manufacturer has tests set up so you can be a specialist. It just comes down to which dealer actually encourages you to go to school. Try for Ford or Nissan. You'll have experience and education while getting paid from working their. No matter what your final decision is, you won't suddenly become good, it takes a long time to understand so many components. If you know of a tuner shop you can talk with the manager and ask them what kind of experience they're looking for.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Im probably late to the party; when you take the old hardware off you have to clean the rust off the actual bracket where the new hardware sits. If you have to really force pads on then those pads will stick and wear extremely prematurely. The most fight you should have with putting in new pads is a light tap with the old pad or a small hammer.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>This isnt so much of a bad response; i used to go to ihop everyweek (stopped because i had low money). Usually i get the same waitress but one week i get a different one, she was in a bad mood i guess, i think i asked for flavored pancakes but got regualar ones. Honestly, i dont give a shit, their strawberry syrup is the shit. My bill comes out to about 20 bucks and i always pay with my card, i left the waitress $21 dollar time (the single to hide the 20, swiper no swiping) , the next week i get that same waitress. And without me having to order, she has food right out to me. Which works out because i order the same thing every week anyways.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I work about 55 hours a week. Five and a half days a week as a mechanic at a truck shop, time is seriously pointless. Start at 7am leave at 5pm monday through friday and saturdays its 7am -12pm. Only allowed a 15 min breakfast and 30 min lunch break. I couldnt go out for lunch if i wanted to. Theres a food truck that comes through every morning, usually the same time. Believe me, after a month working like this, it's like a hell. Leave saturday afternoon and there's the work you have to continue on monday morning. The guys i work with are here 5, 10, 20 and one guy 30 years. They're comfortable here even though this work is draining their life. I think some are just too scared to leave. Too scared to go to a new envionment. Customers dont care, a shop that can actually fix a vehicle right the first time with out bullshit, theyll come and keep coming. Employers dont care, they have too many contracts to keep in line. Employees dont care, it's just an endless dangerous cycle. I made the choice of never looking to be in a relationship with anyone, short and long term, it just isnt worth it. And it wouldn't even be fair, for either of us.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I worked at a dealer as an express tech for a couple of years. I worked a quick drive-on lift and i usually always had a car for about 20 mins and then i drive it to the car wash section. On my own i can do about 20 cars a day consisting of tire repair/replace, oil changes ans anything else that was light and quick work. Mind you, even though it was easy work, there was a lot of it and it usually never slowed down. Some services paid about 1.5 hours, that was simple rotate and balance, oil changes, and some additives. A bonus with these services was that it came with stickers that the company would reimburse the techs and service advisors. This went out to the other techs in the express team and i got stuck with all jobs that made me almost no time. Some vehicles were simply too large to be worked in the express area so i was given that job and i either had to do it on the floor or had to go to a different part of the shop to use a proper lift. Problem with that was i had to carry tools back and forth as the service carts provided by the shop was already being used. I wanted to complain but it was pointless. I was told to keep working and it'll be handled. I was given a pay decrease because i was logging too many hours and they didn't understand why they were paying a low level tech so much. I also found out that the rest of the team had taken pay cuts as per the team leader. I was the lowest paid person on that team and my voice was shut down. Eventually management finally understood the problem and moved some people around. Those people were given raises and bigger jobs to work on. I was also given a raise, back to what i originally started with. A year later i quit because my pay was lowered again. And when i did, i found out that 5 replacements were to take over. Problem with that was management didnt want to pay the hours expected. A month or so ago i get a call from a new manager asking to talk. The damage was done and the new manager knew the place i am currently working at is really good. Tl;dr: Learn when to walk away.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>[I believe this website is way better help](https://www.nissanusa.com/about/corporate-information.html). Scroll all the way down to the phone number before the biography section, if you decide to call, ask for the customer support, tell them this: i have a concern regarding my nissan, i have went to the dealer and i believe they performed improper procedures to properly resolve the issue. (Hopefully you still have receipts because this will help) i have reciepts from the dealers i went to. At one point the dealer recommended replacing a wheel bearing without actually proving this was the cause. After the repair, the noise was still present and i then decided to take my vehicle to a private shop. I also have a reciept from that private shop showing that my concern was caused by a loose heat shield which was secured by a clamp. They should ask you if you want to open a claim and you may get a refund. Keep in mind though, corporate nissan doesnt actually run dealerships so the have no actual control over them. But, corporate nissan has more power over the head managers of those dealers. Maybe youll have a happy ending?</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I went to community college for automotive and didnt bother to finish. I actually got my first job because of that school and when i went to work, everything i learned was useless. Seriously, i wasted my time going to school. It took me 4 years of eating shit as a lube tech to be okay. I now work at a truck shop working on medium duty trucks, only get paid 17 an hour but im there 50+ hours a week so i guess i make okay money. I still live at home, honestly, i have no choice. For almost 4 1/2 years i spent most of my money buying tools, thousands of dollars. I dont have them all but ive got enough to get by. This is the year i have actual plans of moving out; im hoping to find a place for about 1k a month, if it's a little more so be it. I dont want an empty apartment, i want an actual place to call home, i want things in it. The best decision ive made was getting a part time job. Im taking home more money and the price is giving up time.</TEXT>

Last year i got a part time job so im averaging about 72 hours a week. I guess its kind of a win-lose-win-lose situation. I make two incomes on my own but it costs time.

    <TEXT>I'm the bad guy, I'm the one everyone is afraid of. It's been this way for a very long time. I've seen the world change. Sometimes I wonder if it's for the better or it's gotten worse. That's not something I can dwell on, my only concern is doing my job. My job is to keep them safe, my job is to keep them afraid. What else can I do? I'd like an answer on that. Some say I can change shapes, some say I can take the form of your worst fear. Ha, I can't do all that. One of my favorite powers is letting them never know. Mind you, I can't be everywhere, I hope there is more of my kind, but I can't dwell on that. I've got a job to do. I have to keep them safe. I have to keep them afraid. It doesn't happen all the time but it's happening in a few moments. I hear someone coming. It's a feeling, a negative feeling. The kind where something feels very off. I have to wait. This someone opens the window and struggles just a little getting in. I have to wait. This someone creeps softly to the bed where the kid sleeps and stands over her for a moment. Yeah, they're that kind of guy. Not just yet. They watch just a little bit longer, really taking in the moment. They are about to start. The hand reaches out, i see the nails shine in the soft moon glow that comes through that window. It's a woman, ain't that something. Yeah, it's time. I give out just a soft growl. She pauses. "Tell me your name" I say to this predator. She gasped, phew I was right. She spins around looking for me. No one can see me. But they can feel me. I move to her chest, where the stomach is and I give to a light squeeze. She clutches herself and starts in a panic. I go for her throat, where the vocal chords are and give it a squeeze. She screams but can only let out a violent huff. I have to keep them safe. I have to keep them afraid.</TEXT>

    <TITLE>What are the steps needed to open a shop?</TITLE>
    <DATE>2019-05-20 01:48:37</DATE>
    <TEXT>I've been in the automotive field for about 5 years, I literally only have 5 years of experience, but I think the direction I want to take is opening my own shop. I get that I'll probably never get to a chain or a dealership level shop, then again I don't have an interest in getting there. My main goal is to create a shop where both employees and customers *want* to be there. I worked at 6 shops since I started back in January 2014 and for the most part is kind of the same shit everyone deals with whether it is a dealer, chain or a private shop. It can be the shop itself, the people that work there, the customers and/or management. I do have a few things I keep in mind to get to my first main goal: location, finding good employees, supplies (lifts, tire abd alignment machines, computers, etc). But I dont know how much I financially I need to get started. So here I am, I need all the advice I can get, good and bad. Those of you that have or know of people that opened their own shops, how long did it take to be afloat? Or what mistakes did you guys make?</TEXT>

    <TITLE>Who gets the blame? 2004 ford e350 5.4</TITLE>
    <DATE>2019-08-14 04:15:22</DATE>
    <TEXT>This is a weird one and I only know bits of the story, here goes: the shop van lost reverse gear, a new transmission was ordered through ford. A transmission shows up, mechanic puts it in, another mechanic comes by to assist. Bell housing bolts are nice and tight, fresh fluid was put in. Helper mechnic goes to plug in all the connectors and notices that nothing matches up. Foreman goes to look. The wrong transmission is in the van. The shop van transmission wasnt even coming today but a transmission was dropped off. So, who gets the blame? The parts guy for not checking it in? The foreman not specifying which transmission he was looking for? The mechanic installing it? Im guessing the wrong transmission was for a different year/model econoline.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I sometimes go visit one of the dealers I worked at. When I worked there, they had a high turn over rate for techs/mechanics and service writers. I think the major problem with them is how everyone gets paid. Mind you, there are people that do great being flat rate and commission. Personally, I think thats a complete scam. There was a point in time where I cleared 43k, then managers decided that I was making too much money so my rate and only my rate was lowered. It wasn't considered that I was working 70+ hours a week making my time on oil changes, tires, some alignments and recalls that paid less than 1 hour.. It was also my responsibility to sell work for the main shop because all the mechanics did were recalls. The mechanics themselves were upset because the express lube got "gravy work." All the while, if I sold brakes it would get sent away. I got no incentives whatsoever. Flat rate is a scam that gets exploited.</TEXT>

The lady that died begged to survive and the operator treated her as if she just called 911 because she stubbed her toe or got her cat stuck in a tree. But whats it matter? Because it was her last day, she's already resigned and she took a final call which also happened to be a dead womans' last words. Assholes, Amirte?</TEXT>

I was never allowed to go to a classmates birthday party and when I did go to a party I only left when my parents decided it was time to go. I remember a neighbor I grew up with had a birthday party and it turned out I was invited because of my neighbors dad. My father told me to give the kid the present he got for him and to sing happy birthday. Funnily, I had to leave before the party started. I grew up knowing that making a friend would be pointless and now it's a life I live. I don't have anyone to keep a clear head on my shoulder or someone to talk to about anything. It's just me. I just try to work things out a step at a time.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Ive worked in both independent and dealer shops. New cars are coming out every year: toyota is coming out with and awd camry, there's a corolla Prius, tesla has a truck (what a pos that thing is), etc. I don't really have a a particular vehicle I want, I just need something that fits my needs. The only car ive ever owned which was originally under my fathers name is a 2013 toyota highlander, just about 186k. I have no idea how to buy a car, if I do it'll be through a dealer. Dealerships are meant to be warranty repair shops but since thats not understood, they'll try and sell all kinds of packages at a particular price. Independent shops care more about customer loyalty so they'll usually avoid any scammy things. But they carr more about customer loyalty, so they'll do more to make a customer happy and that can have problems on their own. All fluids go bad, or I should say, they lose their integrity. Nissan came out with an awd altima, which is nice but is useless if you get stuck in snow. Because you have to shut the vehicle off for the fluid to cool down. Thats just an example but the idea is the same. Everything goes bad, eventually. Easiest way to tell if fluid is going to go bad is get new fluid and compare it to what's in your vehicle. The darker the fluid, the more its due to be changed. Now lets say whatever fluid your looking at is contaminated, that can ruin a whole system and you'd have to replace all those components. Do you have to do every fluid exchange at once? Nope, but you shouldn't hold off longer than you have to.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I've worked with UTI guys. Firstly, just know that there are good and bad people regardless of where they were educated. The ones I've worked with have a chip on their shoulder, like they know more than guys with experience, which I guess is nice. But come time to actually perform the work it usually, "I didn't learn this," etc. The thing with going to a school like UTI, they try to cram 20 years of hard work into a year and a half or however long the program lasts. Chances are, you might not actually use them or the way you were taught doesn't work. Keep in mind, times are changing pretty fast, in a few years electric vehicles may or may not dominate the market place. Diesels will have more add-ons for regulation purposes. Gasoline vehicles may go obsolete. If you want to go to UTI, then go but it has to be something you need to do and you have to keep in mind, you'll most likely leave there with a lot of debt unless you can get scholarships or grants.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>All I know is vehicles. I dont mean tuning, I mean application. For instance the cybertruck vs. the f-150 video: cybertruck looks pretty heavy so on that alone, I think those two trucks are in different weight classes. When the f-150 was getting dragged, I noticed the front wheels weren't moving forward. Maybe the pick up isn't 4wd? Anyway, if tesla really wanted to impress they should've used a dual real wheel truck.</TEXT>
