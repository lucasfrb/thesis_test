    <DATE>2018-11-13 14:11:37</DATE>
    <TEXT>First of all, love how they are playing very pleasantly surprised hope they can maintain it. 1- Ryan Spooner to me 90% of the time is invisible, the time I do notice him like on the PP last time he was awful, thank god Quinn took him out after the first PP, put him on the 4th line move up the kids to 3rd line and up 2- Adam Mcquaid should be a depth guy going forward at most, same for Smith 3- Jimmy V and Hayes playing very well. I think this is the best of Hayes you will get, which isn #8217;t bad but I don #8217;t know if it #8217;s worth his price tag 4- Tony D and Neal P have been great Thoughts? Will be at the game on the 21st LGR  #8203;</TEXT>

    <TEXT>100% agree here, that is why i suggested smith and adam are the depth guys because Staal actually is earning that bottom 3 D pair spot. Rotate Fred Claussen/ Smith/ and Adam and if someone needs to be benched for no Hussle you got bodies. BTW does claussen remind you guys of Matt hundwick?</TEXT>

    <TEXT>This is subjective obviously and I guess my list will be in categories of trending right or wrong direction or right where i think they should be Disappointed: Lias andersson- i know hes 20 but he was suppose to be very nhl ready, last couple of games he looked better but i expected more Vlad names- plays hard give him that, just not in love with his skill set. To me to cant have so many of the same player on a team, he basically is a fast, strome, vesey type player and id rather have all of them over vlad Kevin shatt- was happy when we got him for a discount, but I #8217;m not sure if his injuries shook his speed and confidence but his game isn #8217;t good enough Brenden smith- redeemed himself from last year, he is a flex wing, dmen that is basically 3rd pair or 4th liner.. if we could get fox, smith and or shatt r the weakest links on d to my eye test Pleased with progress: Mika- number 1 center nothing left to say stud Pavel buch- quinn hit the right buttons maybe we see what we all hoped blossoming now Chris krid- him and mika the leaders to me he is a top 6 legit player Brenden lem- as we hoped he #8217;d be but with skill Tony D- see buch, did quinn find something, age? Who cares he #8217;s basically what kevin shatt should be ,pleased with his play Alex georg- looks like a rock Ryan strome- played over his head? Who knows looked like a legit 2nd or 3rd liner Right where id thought they #8217;d be: Flipi chytil- i wanted a little more but he #8217;s 19 and I #8217;m excited Fast-steady Brett how- steady Libor hajek -looked great before getting hurt Ryan lindgren- steady in short look Brady skj-great second half i hope trending up Hank- is hank nothing left to add Fed class- was very solid i don #8217;t think management thinks he has a place on our squad but very solid Staal- bounced back nicely Unsure of or just not sure what to do with: Neal pionk- beginning of year i liked his game, over the whole season i think he was the 3rd worse on def behind smith and shatt. Does his off make up for it? Jimmy vesey- sickest guy in the league just teases me too much and idk for some reason he seems like a ryan strome type player John gilmour- just a speedy body not much more i see maybe a pionk light The rest: Besides boo being a border line 4th liner i Don #8217;t think many deserve a comment Ps i miss zucc..

    <TEXT>First I am ecstatic about the 2nd pick boys lets go! Second sorry i am on a train on my phone for how poor this might come out. Our crop of dmen we all know as of right now are not very good. We have too many guys that need time to develop and not enough spots. I think some trades are bound to come your thoughts? We have Brady skjei , tony D, marc staal, kevin shatty, neal pionk, Brendan smith , libor hajek, ryan lind, and yegor rykov most likely coming over. 9 guys with staal and smith we can #8217;t do much without buyouts unless somehow we can trade them. Who do u think gets a shot at the roster and who do you believe gets moved? LGR!</TEXT>

Pionk, shatty, tony D( who got better) ,smith( who is a hybrid wing now lol) we need more d men who actually play well in the d zone.

It is still around but the jap side stoped making content and the game will die when player base has gone down to not make much profit. That taught me to to only spend what u deem u think the people making the game deserve. The rest is just the impulse i want shiny new when in reality when you are end game you aren #8217;t playing much anyway. In conclusion i would never tell u how to spend your money, but spending money on a non gate guaranteeing 5 star is basically playing a slot machine at a casino, we know how that usually goes...</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Agree i thought season 9 was great, this episode was not. All the reasons you gave, plus ill add the fact they ended 9 on a cliff hanger with the radio and we got no answer to that. The awkward talked between saddqi( i think thats how u spell his name) and the new doc.? Which i watch all the time i am sure most of you know his name but I don #8217;t believe i remember it or was ever told it. Where did they get all that water from? The spartan fighting in the first scene, then when a horde comes they use no fighting tactics. Overall just a slow and felt like filler which should not be to the first episode of a new season.

His broken stick in the sens game leading to a goal, just his game in general i dont enjoy watching and i would be shocked if they get anymore more then a 4th or 5th for him - we need scoring on another line obviously and i think the need for a 2nd center to emerge from our young guys this year. If we dont we might have to flip some of these d men prospects along with whatever we get from a chris krids trade to get that Just play lias more then 8-10 a game, give him 10-12 cut back on strome if you have to lGRs boys!</TEXT>

Maybe they are increasing peoples trade values, but they are hurting the growth of our youth movement. I think most of are talent is here already( in Harford as well I'm speaking) we just need to develop it. Letting them play and make mistakes is how. Just need someone to voice what is going on b/c scoring 2 goals a game and losing not even with the kids is not what I want to see either.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Dwayne Casey was down to a 3rd string PG, No Griffin and still you saw all those players run an offensive system. Even if they missed a lot more of there shots, you could see the ball movement and players moving without all the ball, dare I say fundamentals? Fiz was Hired because they thought he could attract the KD's and KI 's of the world which we didn't. We now see this coach has no x's and O's knowledge at all. For the love of god I don't care if we are bad but as long as 1 I see a offensive system in place and the team run it, don't care if they miss shots as long as you can see it. 2 people held accountable, if people quit on the floor you take them out and bench them, see the NY rangers and what they do when players play soft or have a trash game 3. play the young kids or players with promise more. We know the ceiling of Bobby Portis, Wayne Ellington. Could we Get DOT more minutes? Could we see plays run for Knox? Alozno please play more. I don't think Fiz is a coach that can teach the things young players could need to be successful, he is an assistant coach period.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>you see off the ball screens? Do you see pick and rolls? Do you see penetration and kick outs? Do you see 3-4 passes before a shot? I see randle dribbling up the ball. I see him doing spin moves at 15 feet away and turning the ball over. I see Melo ISO ball with Morris a ton. I see Knox standing on the 3 point line not moving for 4-5 times in a row. I see Barrett trying to break his back to carry this team when he driving and people standing around watching( no hitting the offensive glass). Then you saw the Pistons offence last night right? That was basketball. On D that also is coaching. We can switch on pick and rolls because we have a lot on long boys. Knox has horrible defensive instincts I agree. But when that 6 point play happen last night they gave up. They don't play smart def. Again this is coaching. There is enough vets on the floor that should be tightened up. Aside from Knox the rest don't have terrible instincts and I expect a team with that many men out to be held under 120 I'm sorry</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I asked you a question that you didn't answer. I didn't agree with you lol. The GM perry and Fiz picked most of these players from FA. They all have regressed, every one of them. What is Fiz doing to make these guys better or helping? IF he is trying it isn't working They aren't all 19,20,21 year olds. We had KP how did that work out? Traded him got nothing. It is a losing culture and it has to change from the inside before players come.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>So we will see these players stats end of year and i am more than sure they will all be worse than before they came here. Philly got joel and ben thrn basically everyone else from trades and free agents so philly did go that route. When u have great players i bet someone else could do just as good as brown when u have great players. It would be nice loke the nets have when u develop and see progress like joe harris, spencer din, levert and so on that is my point. U dont see progress here</TEXT>

Next year the Rangers will be very good, this year they will be right there for the playoffs and most likely just miss with mostly kids.

He is a high volume shooter who is chucks 3s. I wouldn't want Randle on my team and you have your opinion and I have mine. Eddy curry was an Allstar one season so tell me about Randle's hollow numbers getting better, than why didn't the team resign him and not let him walk? Look at the amount of minutes Portis, Morris are getting who aren't going to be here past this year, than yesterday look at knox 10 mins, dsj 15, Mitch 14( foul trouble I know play him until he fouls out). even DOT didn't play much.

And randle came here bc no team in their right mind would pay him 18 to be a volume chucker. He makes no one around him better and he is a terrible passer. Wins and losses are all that matter in the nba so u explain that to dolan when fiz gets canned because u say wins and losses don #8217;t matter lmao. Let me know when if or when randle is ever a top 3 option on a real contenting title team. He is only 24 u know what, eddy curry played like an allstar one year, lmk when randle is one.</TEXT>

His rotations on PNR are terrible, he gets caught in no mans land, and he just doesn't play well in team defense. I hope they can help him get better bc I see him trying (hence why he drops his head a lot bc he gets down on himself). I like knox , we all knew he was a project.

    <TEXT>for Dotson had no offence that game, should have been taken out when that run happend. No team wanted randle for that money IDK what you are drinking. Not to mention none of those teams are title teams. If you have a culture of losing which the Knicks do, what player wants to stay in that environment? KP left. So wins and losses matter. The Celtics rebuilt in 1 year, The rangers rebuild in 1 year. Knicks still rebuilding from 2013 wake up. if 20-30 wins to you is a success that is sad and pathetic. Eddy curry played LIKE an allstar and got us no where, just like Randle will do. Im done arguing with your thick headed self. enjoy 20 wins.</TEXT>

And I think the system is bad on the Def more than the players Defensemen into 2 categories.. Offence and defense Tony D- Off- A / Def-C Adam Fox- Off- A / Def- B Libor Hajek- Off-C / Def-C Ryan Lindgren Off- C / Def-B Brady Skjei Off- C+ / Def-C Marc Staal- Off-C / Def-C+ Jacob Trouba Off- B / Def-B Goalies Alex G- A King - A- Forwards/Centers Breadman- A++ Mika- A++ Strome- A- Exceeded expectaions J. Fast- B+ - gives it his all always all you can ask should be a 4th liner 3rd liner fill in Filip- B improving I'm sure end of season grade might get bumped Chris Kreider- B same old either game changer or invisable Brandon Lemieux B- see fast, I see him as a higher ceiling Though Kakko- C+ - I have to remind myself he is only 18, I thought/Hoped he could get 16-20 goals and maybe around 35-40 points. Howden- C - just not enough progress at all, plays hard though... maybe a 3rd liner if he really progresses Buch- C - Hands of stone reminds me of Brian Boyle Greg McKegg- C just a plug...I miss our 4th liners like Moore, Boyle..etc B. Smith- C Tries hard just not a forward and not a good player Haley- C- yes C-</TEXT>
