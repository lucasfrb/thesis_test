    <TEXT>Here's just a few tips  amp; tricks I've picked up along the way: 1.) You can keep track of how many days you're clean but, I've learned it's worked better if I mark the day of my last yeet and then I don't check it everyday or frequently. If you track it everyday ive learned this makes me feel very anxious and it makes me feel like there will be something at the end of those days (for example a relapse) 2.) Fresh lemon juice applied once or twice a day for like 5min rlly helps with fading scars (make sure the wound is healed it burns like a motherf*cker) 3.) Supermarket clothes are hella cheap and thus the material is really thin, so buying long sleeved shirts or flannels from like Walmart that are thin can help in the summer 4.) As far as distractions or substitutions for SH that the internet/therapist have given me, not many have worked, but throwing myself into work/homework helps, reading, music, texting friends, and painting my nails (rlly anything that evolves both or one of your hands) 5.) Doing self care things face mask, washing your face, clipping your nails, taking a nice shower, putting on lotion, eating healthy, etc. Anyone can do these things! You have to do these things on a reg basis. I find taking care of myself even if I don't feel up to it or think I deserve it makes me feel better, and more confident, something about it just instills into your brain that your worth being taken care of even if you're not actively thinking that. 6.) Go for a walk or exercise, whether it's just walk around the block, doing this gives you something to do and it helps keeps your body functioning and can help you concentrate more, etc. 7.) Hang out around good ppl, I know sometimes its like your friends hate you, and if they do you deserve better, and you should ditch any negative ppl. I know at times it feels like you deserve the constant negativity, but you don't, and eventually you will find friends who legitimately care! 8.) Oh, and, when you mark your last yeet (I use my phone's calendar which has a notes section) say what pushed you over the edge. I know this can sometimes be hard to do because the reason can seem so small (small doesn't mean insignificant) especially if you haven't yeeted in a while. But this can help you identify triggers and usually therapist ask why so this can help you remember why.</TEXT>

    <DATE>2020-08-24 00:15:51</DATE>
    <TEXT>I've been seeing a lot of people asking things like, "does this count as SH?" To answer this question to the best of my capabilities, anything that is purposeful harm to your body/mind is SH. Accidentally c*tting in the shower isn't SH. This can be triggering but it doesn't count. Accidentally burning yourself while cooking, again, can be triggering but not SH. Accidents happen, they can trigger you, but just take a deep breath you're gonna be alright. You're stronger than you think you are. Also I wanted to meantion, I see some ppl comparing their pain to others, saying they don't think they deserve to be in this sub reddit because they don't thing they're problems are big enough. Everyone's life is different, some ppl have it a bit easier than you, some have it harder than you, this DOES NOT mean you're problems don't matter just because they're not as bad as someone else's. At the end of the day PAIN IS STILL PAIN and your pain is valid. From what I can tell this is a community built for support and to have a bit of a laugh at our pain. Everyone deserves support, your problems matter, and you matter.</TEXT>

    <TITLE>A Few Tips</TITLE>
    <DATE>2020-08-24 18:59:54</DATE>
    <TEXT>Here's some SH first aid tips:  #8226; Have a first aid kit that includes things like alcohol swabs, band-aids of all sizes, medical tape, non-stick pads, butterfly bandages, neosporin  #8226; And I don't burn myself when I SH but I've had a lot of nasty burns in my lifetime and manuka honey and standard burn creams have helped those heal amazingly. It smells a little weird but it helps.  #8226; And whatever you use to SH please make sure it's clean and sterilized!!  #8226; Learn to recognize when you need medical attention. I know when you SH frequently a deep cut doesn't really shock you so you may not realize that you need stitches. If you need medical help, please get medical help.  #8226; Don't use tissues to stop the bleeding, they can break down and cause infection! I use a CLEAN rag and then immediately rinse it in the sink or preferably put it straight into the wash machine before the stain sets in.  #8226; Make sure you keep your wounds clean and dry to prevent infection! Infections can seem like no big deal, everyone has had an infected cut before, but they can get really dangerous left untreated. People still lose limbs over untreated infections! I'll probably add more things to this post or make a pt 2. These were just some things off the top of my head. I'm not encouraging SH, but slip-ups happen and I think it's best ppl know how to take care of them properly when they do! Stay safe!  #9825;</TEXT>

    <DATE>2020-08-24 20:11:39</DATE>
    <TEXT> #8226; Getting out of a cycle of self-hatred and self-harm is extremely difficult, but it can be done! You're so strong!  #8226; When your parents take away sharp things from your room and do body checks it's uncomfortable and it seems like it's the end of the world, but they do this because they care! This is something my family/friends never did, but sometimes I wish they did because this better than them completely ignoring it.  #8226; Tell someone you trust. Having someone to confide in is super important!  #8226; Tell your parents or an adult you trust so you can get the help you need. Personally, I told my therapist after months of working up the courage to do it so she could tell my parents for me.  #8226; Slip-ups happen, but it's not the end of the world! When you're getting clean the goal is to stop. When a slip-up happens it might push you back a few steps but it's important to keep moving. Don't beat yourself up over it!  #8226; Learning to forgive yourself is an important part in recovery. Not everything bad that happens in your life is your fault, some things are just out of your hands, and that's okay.  #8226; A good thing you can do to help forgive what you've done to your body is to start caring for it. Put lotion on especially in places you've SH, wash your hair and face, do a face mask, eat healthy things. You'll feel better!</TEXT>

    <TEXT>It's difficult but necessary. If the wound is not able to close on It's own and you need stitches, then you need to go get them. I can understand the fear but it could get infected and contaminated and that can be EXTREMELY dangerous. Your mom might get mad but again, it so important you get medical help if needed. Take care of yourself and good luck!</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Yeah, I can understand that. I also have a very religious family and thats hard to live with when you know they most likely won't accept you. I've just always known i was bi, it was never rlly a question for me. I was in denial for many years trying to bury that part of myself. My advice is to learn to accept that part of yourself and it you might never come out to your family and that will hurt. But I believe that if you accept that part of yourself then it doesn't f*cking matter what others think. If they don't like you for you, then they don't f*cking deserve you! Oh, and only come when you 100% certain that its safe to come out to the person you're coming out to. Otherwise it'll be a complete sh*t show</TEXT>

    <TITLE>Things To Do Instead of SH</TITLE>
    <DATE>2020-08-25 21:29:08</DATE>
    <TEXT>1.) Get a worry stone. They're these smooth rocks that can rub when you're nervous. 2.) Make a playlist either for you or for a friend. I personally do this one a lot, the amount of Spotify playlist I have is insane. 3.) Write in a journal. Personally, I use the default notes app on my phone, and I write letters to people about how they make me feel, but I never send them. I just write it down to get it out of my head. Or I write poems there. You can just write down how you feel just to get it out there in the universe. 4.) Exercise. I see some people posting that everytime the get the urge to cut they do 1 push-up. I personally love to go for a run or even just a walk. 5.) You can draw on your arm or thigh or even paper. I've heard a lot of people have success. Bic makes Bodymark pens that wash off that you can use. You don't have to be an artist, anyone can draw. You can also buy a henna kit off Amazon. I'd read the reviews first to make sure it won't turn your skin green or something weird like that. 6.) Paint your nails. You don't even have to have color you can just do a clear coat. 7.) Learn an instrument. I'm trying to learn guitar, for example. 8.) Reorganize your bedroom. Making sure my room is clean and my bed is made daily has really improved my mental state. It makes me feel less lazy, and yes, it is just making a bed. But sometimes, it's the small victories that take us far. 9.) Dye your hair. This is one of my favorites. It doesn't even have to be forever. You can buy Manic Panic semi-permanent hair dye from Hot Topic and it only last a few weeks. You don't even need to bleach your hair, sometimes when you have darker hair it's kinda pretty 'cause in the sun you'll just see little streaks of color. 10.) Do volunteer work. Sometimes helping others, helps you. But don't forget you need help sometimes too. Put yourself first. 11.) Make a list of good things in your life. It's easy when you're sad to only see the dark in the world but there are good things in your life even if they're small. 12.) Make a list of future goals, something to strive for. For example, going to college or traveling. 13.) Hang out with a few friends. 15.) Watch a movie or some TV 16.) Read a book. If you don't own any or don't have any new reads you can download Wattpad and there's loads of free books, some are atrocious, some are actually super great. 17.) Start a collection. I have many of these. I collect pins/buttons, Pop! Dolls, wolf figurines, books, jewelry, etc. 18.) Blast music. This is another personal favorite of mine, but not of my family, because I tend to blast heavy metal, metalcore, rock, etc. 19. ) I've meantioned this before, but you can do some self care things, like a face mask, washing your face/hair/teeth, putting on lotion. Just in general learning to take care of your body instead of doing continuous damage. These are just some things I thought of off the top of my head. I may make a pt 2 this at some point. I think it's important to note that some of these may work, some may not. Everyone is different, but just because one doesn't work for you doesn't mean they don't all work. It's worth to give some these a try, I mean, it can't hurt anything.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>1.) The bleeding needs to be under control. Find a clean cloth and apply pressure for like 1-2min, then check to see if it's stopped, if not, continue applying pressure. 2.) Clean the wound. Wash with warm water 3.) Dry the wound. You can use a separate clean cloth 4.) Bandage the wound. Depending on the depth. If its deep, but not deep enough for stitches you can use butterfly bandages to help it close, and if it's not that deep just a regular bandage should do. If I cut a lot I would use a non-stick pad and hold it down with medical tape instead of wasting like 7 band-aids. If you do need stitches please see a doctor. 5.) Rinse the rags immediately so the stain doesn't set in and then throw 'em into the wash. 6.) Make sure clean out the wound daily and change the bandages regularly to prevent infections If I left anything out feel free to comment them down below</TEXT>

I still want to use it but I feel so guilty for taking it so I'm just trying my best to stay away from the damn thing but it's been on my mind all day. The only other thing except for guilt thats stopping me as the fact i dunno if my standard soap and water will do for sterilizing it. It looks clean, but looks can be deceiving so</TEXT>

So far, I've tried [AmLactin](https://www.target.com/p/amlactin-daily-moisturizing-body-lotion-paraben-free-7-9oz/-/A-14516456?ref=tgt_adv_XS000000 amp;AFID=google_pla_df amp;fndsrc=tgtao amp;CPNG=PLA_Beauty%2BPersonal+Care%2BShopping amp;adgroup=SC_Health%2BBeauty amp;LID=700000001170770pgs amp;network=g amp;device=m amp;location=9031780 amp;ds_rl=1246978 amp;ds_rl=1248099 amp;gclid=CjwKCAjwq_D7BRADEiwAVMDdHsXgDqVivX_5idVcvG7B54Bxq64W3qw0bEL_aiUm7wtZMexOHfmIpRoCeikQAvD_BwE amp;gclsrc=aw.ds), [CeraVe](https://www.target.com/p/cerave-sa-body-lotion-for-rough-and-bumpy-skin-with-salicylic-acid-8oz/-/A-15025381), and I've been using one of these [loofah](https://www.target.com/p/bath-loofah-colors-may-vary-up-38-up-8482/-/A-51523874?ref=tgt_adv_XS000000 amp;AFID=google_pla_df amp;fndsrc=tgtao amp;CPNG=PLA_Beauty%2BPersonal+Care%2BShopping amp;adgroup=SC_Health%2BBeauty amp;LID=700000001170770pgs amp;network=g amp;device=m amp;location=9031780 amp;ds_rl=1246978 amp;ds_rl=1248099 amp;gclid=CjwKCAjwq_D7BRADEiwAVMDdHuX5EelaqfKKN690MUWmb-vyUiSybY72Q9rqx4x_BV7hnYYnlq_2whoCVc4QAvD_BwE amp;gclsrc=aw.ds) things to exfoliate my skin. I'm very sensitive to smell and feel. With the the AmLactin the smell was just atrocious. And with CeraVe I saw very little improvement. I went through a whole bottle and I applied it everyday, also, the smell was light but it was also very chemically and was so greasy. I felt like it was never really absorbing into my skin it was just resting on the surface and then drying out. Plus, the oily-ness made me break out. I don't know if any of you have experience with kp, but any help is appreciated. Also, keep in mind price, I don't want to spend too much nor do I have the money for expensive products. Thanks!</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I know this isn't a funny meme or someshit so I apologize in advance. I just had to say, the past 3 days since I found Unus Annus thanks to a friend of mine life has been easier to get through. I'm sad I've come to the channel so late but they've been helping me to not self-harm especially when I'm alone at 1:00 AM. That is a gift I'm extremely grateful for. This channel has definitely left a mark on me. Thanks again!  #10084;</TEXT>
