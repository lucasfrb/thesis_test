    <TEXT>The problem is that there's no accountability in the CBC. Myself and many others have complained over various issues to the @CBCOmbudsman who [instead of actually trying to investigate or hold the CBC accountable just ends up defending them.](http://globalnews.asia/in-2017-cbc-ombudsman-dismissed-100-of-complaints/) Don't believe me? Check out some of the 'Complaint Reviews' yourself: http://www.ombudsman.cbc.radio-canada.ca/en/complaint-reviews/ Oh yea, and the Ombudsman limits her scope to CBC News content only, she won't cover "Comedy" stuff, probably wouldn't cover this "Marketplace" piece either.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Yea you say it's false but I'm the one who has contacted the Ombudsman many times. They absolutely refuse to entertain any complaints about CBC Comedy (even when it is political in nature, like This Hour Has 22 Minutes). BTW: Go read some of the complaint reviews. The Ombudsman writes as if she is the CBC's legal counsel! Often starting from a position of 'neutrality', [but then going into a defense of the CBC as if the Ombudsman is part of the organization (which she actually is).](http://globalnews.asia/in-2017-cbc-ombudsman-dismissed-100-of-complaints/) The Ombudsman is appointed by the CBC (2/4 members), then approved by the CBC CEO etc etc. There's nothing "independent" about them, and they have no enforcement power. (not that it matters because they aren't interested in enforcing or investigating anything)</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Yes, it would "split the left". It would also end up with the left winning more seats overall. Trudeau and allies promised to implement electoral reform 1800+ times.

    <TEXT>They're definitely biased to the Liberals! The criticism of the Liberals on CBC news has been tepid at best. IMO this comes at the expense of the NDP as well as the conservatives. But the NDP hasn't really put forward any strong candidates lately, so it's hard to say, maybe they're secret NDPers? Honestly I think they will support whichever left-wing party promises them the most federal funding.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Honestly I think that's a big part of what's driving the CBC's endless American coverage. They'd much rather criticize Trump than Trudeau, and Trump is an easy target that Canadians mostly hate anyway. Journalism shouldn't just be about picking an easy target and reinforcing the cognitive biases of your readers though! I'd prefer they focused more on holding our government accountable.

Americans, on the other hand, are truly free, capable of voting in elections and choosing their leaders instead of kneeling before the crown.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>damn right. part of the rate "cut" is just moving the low-income subsidy tax to a general tax instead of on electricity.. the rest of it is just more reckless borrowing and will cost more overall. "smoothing out" my ass. then there's the clusterfuck with the "Global Fund #8221; where big electricity buyers get subsidized by the rest of us..</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I mean, we can't know! Maybe she did ask the gentleman to take her pissed pants off and keep molesting her even after she lost consciousness. It's an odd request but I saw someone order ketchup for his salmon filet once so who knows! I don't know what I had for dinner on Tuesday. Maybe over dinner I asked someone to molest me! It would certainly seem out of character for me today but who knows, I might have been tipsy enough on Tuesday...!? Who's to say? On that note, let me use this space to draft a living will! Just in case there may come a time when I black out, fall unconscious and there'll be the totally understandable doubt whether I may have asked for someone like my taxi driver to take my urine stained pants off so he could have his way with me! I, Samuel Enderby, being of sound and disposing mind, memory and understanding, do hereby willfully and voluntarily make, publish and declare this to be my living will, making known my desire that my pants shall not be removed by any person or institution other than myself, my girlfriend or, only in the case of an emergency, my siblings. I further declare that I do not wish to be penetrated by any person, not with any of their body parts nor with instruments of any kind, again, excepting my girlfriend with her body parts and with her instruments, aside from the purple one because good Lord. In addition, should there ever be any doubt about this, I don't want to just hand the entire contents of my wallet over to a shady looking character. And because I can just feel it'll come up, no, I do not wish for my organs to be harvested from my body before my death. I'm sure I forgot some things I could fall victim to in my life where it could be reasonably assumed I was really asking, nay, begging for them to happen! Phew!</TEXT>

    <TEXT>The CBC Ombudsman is not there to 'ensure their journalistic standards and practices are upheld'. The CBC Ombudsman is there for the same reason that the LCBO runs "anti-drinking" ads, or the Gaming Commission tries to "stop problem gamblers." IE: plausible deniability [In 2017 so far the Ombudsman literally rejected 100% of the complaints. Even one from a woman who proved they got the story wrong, twice, the Ombdusman could only meekly say "they should try harder."](http://globalnews.asia/in-2017-cbc-ombudsman-dismissed-100-of-complaints/)</TEXT>
