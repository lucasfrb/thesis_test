    <TITLE>Looking for some episodes, help!</TITLE>
    <DATE>2014-03-24 17:49:48</DATE>
    <TEXT>Hi guys! I really like Top Gear but I don't have time to watch all of the seasons and epiosdes. And probably I wouldn't like all of them cause I'm not a a big fan of motorization stuff. That beign said, I really love episodes where they go for a big trip or something like that, for example the North Pole (I think it was the North Pole). Recently I've watched 21x03, where they went to the Ukraine (I really liked that one!) and some more but I can't really remeber I think one more special or something like that. My question is, can you guys help me find some more really cool and funny episodes, similar to ones I've already watched? I'd really love to watch them but I don't know if there are any of kind that I'm looking for. Can you please recommend me something? I would really appreciate that. Sorry for my english, it's not my native language. Thanks for any advices and help.</TEXT>

Thanks for any advince and help!</TEXT>

    <DATE>2014-04-07 13:32:08</DATE>
    <TEXT>Hi guys, I wanted to play a Crusader, but just saw a plenty of gameplays and articeles about him beign weak, and just didin't touched that class that much. Now, when 2.0.4 is on the way (for those who dosen't know, here is the link: http://www.diablofans.com/news/48018-diablo-3-reaper-of-souls-first-patch-2-0-4) I was just wondering. Will those buffs buff Crusader a lot? Will they touch any of his mobility, wrath as a spender and just overall dmg? I just don't know much about a class and his skills so I'd like to get some answers and opinions from you guys. Thanks!</TEXT>

I tested it and it's the same every time, while I'm on Steed Charge I will "pick up" globe but not get a buff from it. Help and spread it!</TEXT>

    <TEXT>https://www.facebook.com/DemanHD/posts/798305413559849 For those who dosen't have access to facebook: "This might come as a surprise to a lot of you but today I have left Riot Games as a shoutcaster. I've thoroughly enjoyed my time and the opportunities offered to me over the last 2 years at Riot Games with everyone that's worked so hard on making eSports for League of Legends become the huge success it now is. It's been such a great change to my life from the 9 to 5 office job that I used to have, to seeing and covering the last 4 seasons all around the world. 2 years ago in December I joined Riot Games as the first  #8220;Rioter #8221; in Cologne to work on the new LCS project in collaboration with Turtle Entertainment (ESL). I was happy to take this leap of faith as I had worked with ESL for 2 years prior on the Intel Extreme Masters events and had a solid trust of everyone involved. I have no doubt that had the studio stayed in Cologne I would not have made this change, but now my life is in Cologne and I have chosen to take the opportunity to work alongside Joe Miller in his new position at ESL and help guide the excellent casting team they have. Thanks to everyone that has supported me throughout my casting career online and offline at events. I shall continue to cast League of Legends when possible with ESL, this is not the end for me, quite the opposite as I plan to go on for many years covering many other games."</TEXT>
