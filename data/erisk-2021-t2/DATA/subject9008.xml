    <TEXT>isin't jj abrams the guy that destroyed star wars and star trek? (not that i care i don't watch those movies)... Personaly i would really like to see Ari Aster making a shining related movie or tv serie. His movie Hereditary gave me some serious kubrick vibes XD He used a lot of single point perspectives and added a ton of details and clues all over the movie. I can't recall another movie that reminded me of the shining that much.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>the only somewhat good scene in the last act. And it took me at least a couple seconds to realise that this was supposed to be jack XD i really don't understand why people liked this movie that much. The story has a lot of plot holes and the last part is nothing but bad fan service IMO. the first half was ok.</TEXT>

    <TITLE>(The shining)(Doctor Sleep) Tony is actualy another human using his shine to help danny</TITLE>
    <DATE>2020-06-09 21:02:24</DATE>
    <TEXT>I really doubt that this is something Kubrick intended in his version of the Shining. But after watching Doctor Sleep, i think that there is a case to be made about Tony actuly being another human who can also shine (at least in flannigan's perspective). In doctor sleep, we can see danny and Abra helping each other by talking inside each other's head and showing things to each other. Just like Tony in the first movie. On the other hand, there is a scene were Danny says to Abra that he used to think that he had an imaginary friend but it turns out it was just his shine, wich kinda pokes a hole in my theory. But a couple scenes later, Danny is desesperate and dosen't know what to do so he call for tony's help. Why would he try to talk with Tony if he knows he is not real? And why would Tony not answer? If tony is dany's shining then he should still be able to talk to him. I think the reason Danny cannot talk to Tony anymore is perhaps because Tony is dead (or maybe even captured by Rose? how cool would that be!). And one last thing, in the original movie, Tony always reffer to Wendy as Mrs Torrence. In the book, Tony is Danny from the future, i don't recall if he also says "mrs torrence" tho. Why would you call your own mother Mrs Torrence? Anyway, i'm not sure if this theory makes sense but i think i could have been a really cool idea to explore in doctor Sleep. Just imagine if Tony was one of the person captured by Rose the Hat and Dany ends up having to kill him!</TEXT>

You talk like they have more than enough time to shoot someone, the average human will run at something like 7 or 8 meters per second. For 20 meters that's like three seconds, and even less for 20 feets. you cant ask cops to rely on that 20 feet distance, if they miss they are done.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>and you have possibly more education than i do, i don't know. but i do have a university degree and i just don't like it when people throw the word racist like that just for fun. We both seem to live in canada so you should know that labelling someone racist has uge implications and can destroy peoples live, get them kicked out of their jobs and even send them to prison. It is not a word that should be used lightly. What if (for exemple) you said something like '' i believe woman of all ages should be able to dress however they like'' and i said to you : oh so you think a 14 year old girl should dress like a slut? you must be a pedophile! this is the kind of logic you are using here. Pointing out facts based on research is not racist.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>i live in a very tough city ( we have the highest crime rate and rape per person in the whole quebec province). and i just happen to live on the worst street of the worst city, right in the middle of downtown. I have to deal with mentaly ill people and poor people every single day, i even have stitches on my hand right now because a few day ago some homeless guy could not control his dog and the dog bit my hand pretty bad. I see the cops everyday dealing with these people and not once have i seen a cop draw their gun out, and they are always really respectful. We have really really good cops. of ourse sometimes things happens, no system is perfect. and btw for someone who just said ''I #8217;ve never once blamed the individual.'' you sure like to blame cops it seems....</TEXT>

When it's over i walk out with the doctor and he says in front of everyone: "i'm sorry mr X that we had to remove 3 inch". the whole place started laughing so i just looked back at him and said: "don't worry about it, i had more than enough anyway".

    <TEXT>i have no idea, never been there. looks like a cool place tho. but i guess it also depends on what kind of catholicism you have, were i am from we used to have the hardcore version where the chruch owns the hospitals and the schools, and basically had more power than the governement. this is why people got fed up and we had a revolution during wich we decided that we didnt want religion. but in other places like the usa you have a much less rigid type of catholicism wich is probably why a lot of people are still religious.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>i think this was predictable but i'm not sure to what extent it really means anything... mask will slow down the rate at wich people are infected, but eventualy pretty much everyone will get covid 19. Countries where they do not wear mask will get a lot more death faster but will probably be done with covid a lot faster too because the virus won't have any way to spread once everybody get infected. Countries who require masks will get fewer death per day but over a much longer period of time. That's kind of the problem with flattening the curve, you also make the curve a lot longer. I'm not saying one is better than the other, and this is just my subjective opinion i'm not a doctor. In the end i'm pretty sure the number of deaths will be equivalent with or without masks, unless the countries with no masks cannot keep up with the number of sick people and the hospitals are completely overflowing.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>sounds to me like you should find a new therapist first. if he told you that he is really stupid... personnaly i used to see a therapist for a lot of anxiety issues and now i'm on antidepressant and it helps a little bit. but i just stopped going to my therapist and instead i go to a "massage" place (if you know what i mean). for about the same price you get 1 hour with a pretty naked girl and you just talk, and you finish it witha happy ending. it helps me a lot more and it could help you learn to talk to girls at the same time, trust me they will not judge you. No mather how weird or whatever issue you think you have i can assur you they will have seen worst. i was talking with one of the girl the other day and she told me about a few of her clients and trust me you can't get weirder than that. But what works for me might not work for you... just do whatever you feel might help. edit: escorts are not worth it in my opinion, erotic massages are way better imo.</TEXT>

And even if the worst happens and they somehow wake up then they freeze to death? if the train stop everything freeze and like we saw the train need constant maintenance, so if something bad happens the train would eventualy derail for sure.</TEXT>

    <TEXT> gt; not all right-wingers are evil rich assholes but all evil rich assholes are right-wingers I think history would beg to differ, but i'm not trying to start an argument here. I just tought it was funny that your definition of a right wing libertarian was "want to remain rich and kill people" XD. Personally i like the serie but i would love to see them go in a direction similar to animal farm. Where they start in a bad situation and create a revolution only to find out that most of the time, a revolution will make things even worst. Yes the people at the tail are treated badly but still when you look at it in both the movie and the serie revolutions lead to countless murders, treason and unstability. Even in the last episodes of season 1 you see layton becoming more authoritarian because the whole thing is already falling appart a few hours after they won. Anyway that's just my opinion, have a good day!</TEXT>

    <TEXT>yes that is right, i'm not trying to turn this into a political debate but how many revolutions fail for one to work?usualy a lot. And in snowpiercer to be honnest i feel like everybody has a pretty good life besides people from the tail. And from what i understand they boarded the train while they were not supposed to. So i feel like the system in place seems to work pretty good, i mean these people are earth's last survivors and they all get to eat and live in pretty nice conditions. Even the tail to some extend considering they were supposed to die frozen. All they needed was to give the tail a little bit more food or just kill them and everything would have been perfect. Yet they complain about not having the right to procreate... i mean come on, this is about saving humanity. Not about having a fulfilling life with a wife and kids. To be honest i would be more than fine with being in third or second if i was in a similar situation. They all have good lifes except for the tail. And when you think about it the whole train has to be in a perfect balance to work, you can't just have a bunch of people jumping on the train and throwing off that balance so i understand why they would treat the tail people like they did. And in the end what does the tail do? they destroy everything and kill a bunch of people. I understand why the tail is mad because obviously nobody would want to live like that but they are still wrong and causing more harm than anyone. If anything they just screwed up humanity. They should have killed people from the tail right from the start.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>yes that is true, i did not think about that. to be honest i don't understand why the people in first are the the richest people... I mean what is their money worth now? nothing. I think it would have made a lot more sense to have people divided by how much they can help the train last longer. An engineer should be in first for exemple. It would have made a lot more sense to keep the most helpful people in the best conditions and the least helpful in the worst. That way i also think it would have made the serie a lot more interesting because you could root for the tail yet understand why the first acts the way they do. But instead they just went for the "rich people are at the top and they are bad" approach wich makes them unlikable. Therefore you only care about the people from the tail. I like it better when you root for the good guys but have a complex vilain that at least has some motive besides being just "mean and rich". The whole part about LJ being a killer was also very strange to me. i'm not sure why they added that part i didn't think it worked very well.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>another small knitpick... why make the train go around earth??? i understand that was it's original purpose but why just not make a small loop? the snow would not have anough time to pile onto the tracks and we saw that there were parts where they were not even sure if they were gonna make it. Then just don't go to those parts. I think it's not possible that this is just one long track that goes around earth. There has to be ways to go into circles to some extend. just one small loop over and over again seems way smarter to me.</TEXT>

    <TITLE>Want to buy a fender amp</TITLE>
    <DATE>2020-08-13 19:48:57</DATE>
    <TEXT>I own an american standart telecaster and i play it on a Line 6 Flextone III. I was looking to buy a Fender amp because the line 6 is fine but not exactly what i am looking for. I ran into a pawnshop selling two fender amp, a Fender Stage 112 and a Fender Mustang 3. Personally i really like the idea of an old stage 112 with only two channels. I can buy pedals, so i guess wich one would you chose for the clean sound? they are both around 200$</TEXT>

    <TEXT>i bought a used electric guitar for 100$ whe i started. Now i own an american standart telecaster and i love it but i still like the 100$ guitar and play it sometimes. Most guitars nowdays are pretty well made, even the cheap ones. At the end of the day a guitar is nothing more than a piece of wood with a few metal strings and pickups. Anything by Fender will be more than fine don,t worry about it. But if i were you i would by a cheap one first and save for a better one later... after you play a lot your taste changes i would have never tought i would buy a telecaster when i started yet now i would not change it for anything in the world.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>well that's the whole concept of capitalism, keeping prices low with competition. Also i don,t know why you are reffering specifically to rent prices, the price for everything will go up... But in this situation the landlords won't have to "collude", i will just happen by itself. The landlord who was able to live by charging 1000$ per month won't be able to keep up with his expanses since the price of everything will go up and therefore he will have to increase the rent that he charges in order to keep the same lifestyle that he had. It's pretty simple really, the landlord will need to charge more because everything will cost more, not because he wants to make more money.</TEXT>

Tell me how this will keep the prices from rising exactly? and how is this different from someone saying "well it's easy we should just print more money so everybody would be rich". Same argument and same reason why it dosen'T work. Also, where do you take the money from to pay for your UBI? from the rich? because if nobody wants to work because they can live for free there won,t be many rich people, or at least not enough to compensate for all the ones that don't want to work. Humans tend to be lazy when they have to opportunity to do so, people will not work without incentive to do so</TEXT>

    <TEXT>i love it, just make the stairs a little bit better on the left.. like maybe remove the blocks on the left (the ones that kinda look like a ramp) and replace them with wooden fences on the side of the stairs. I think it would make it a lot nicer to have fences used on both the left and the right of the house! Also i would personally add another layer of diagonale for the rooftop so that it almost ends at the same place de balcony does and i would have one or two columns between the balcony and the roof so you can go on it even when it rains. The two pillars under your balcony are also a little bit massive for the size of the house.. maybe i would replace them with wooden fences and stone fences for the bottom! Anyway, nice build dude! Oh and one last thing i think it,s a little bit weird that the window on the left touches the ground (at least it seems like it). I would remove the top layer of dirt and make the house one wooden block lower!</TEXT>

It was more of a way to make myself understood than something that would literally happen. And i have a lot of issues with a "small scale targeted" experiment of UBI... i mean that pretty much just sounds to me like that gave a bunch of people a pay raise and OMG they found out that people were happier with more money! Of course the prices of cars will not go up because a few people got more money! But i haven,t seen the study so perhaps it was well made i don't know. Just seems weird to me at first</TEXT>

    <TEXT>how? do you seriously believe that even under UBI 100% of the population would have acces to it? really? like literally every single person in the country gets acces to that money? of course not. The most vulnerable people will fall in the cracks and a certain percentage of the population will not get it for a number of reasons. Everybody also agrees that prices will go up (how much is up to debate but nobody argues that price will not go up). So therefore the people who would not have access to the UBI would end up even more poor because they don't get more money and the prices go up. What is so controversial about that? what you are suggestings with UBI is a best case scenario where a bunch of people go from poor to middle class wich is good. But you also end up having a bunch of people who are poor and who will now be extremely poor. So basically best case scenario you help a bunch of people by sacrificing a bunch of others...Sounds like of efforts and money on a very risky project. i'm sure there are better way to help people</TEXT>

    <TEXT>the amount of inflation that would come out of a policy like that is up to debate, but one way or the other, either you have minimal inflation wich means that you can live well with that 1400$ per month. wich means that you do not have an incentive to work since 1400$ is enough. That means bad news for business who need workers. Or on the other hand extreme inflation wich means that your 1400$ is not worth anything and you are back to square one, except for extremely poor people who have to deal with increase in prices while not having more money...</TEXT>

    <TEXT>don't know for the usa but where i live in canada they made a lot of laws to restrict the places where you can smoke. I'm fine with it but the problem is that ever since then they have removed ashtrays everywhere. There used to be some on the walls outside of restorants and stores but not anymore... i'm not gonna keep my butts in my pockets for obvious reasons and throwing them in a garbage can be dangerous for fires. So most of the time they end up on the ground unfortunately</TEXT>

I tought it would hurt them the same way they hurted me... Until i realised that even if i killed myself these people probably would not care so i should just work my ass off and try to be better than them. I think i'm on the right track, i finally finished university, landed a good job, started going to the gym and went out with a girl for the first time 2 months ago. two years ago i would have never tought i would be where i am at today, i'm glad i'm still alive even if it is still hard and i still have dark toughts sometime.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>sorry for my bad english but i think this s a good story! This is the only time in my life i felt like something really weird happened and still have no explanation to it to this day. when i was a teen my bedroom was in the basement. The stairs to go down were right next to my room. One night i was not able to sleep and i heard sounds like someone was coming down the stairs. Like i would hear the steps crack one by one slowly going down but the sound was not loud enough to be my mom or my dad. Right before whatever was coming down the stairs made it to the bottom the sound stopped. I started feeling really weird and i could not stop watching my door frame expecting something to appear. I was used to hear weird things since my parents house is more than 100 years old so it always makes weird sounds. But this time it was different and i was truly scared. after like 30 minutes waiting for something to happen i finally tried to go back to sleep and just told myself that it was probably in my head. Then a couple minutes later i hear sound of somebody coming down the stairs but this time it is really loud and going down much quicker. I just saw a head appear in my door frame. I started screaming until i realised it was my mom... so i calmed down and she told me ''i'm sorry i scared you but i was wondering if you went upstairs earlier during the night because i heard somebody walking'' ... It was the only time my mom ever asked me something like this in the middle of the night so she must have really tought someone was there too. And it is not possible that it could have been a real person like a robber because like i said the house is 100 years old and everywhere you walk the floor will crack and my dog would have woken up and started barking.</TEXT>

Personaly i am on the right and i remember during the 2016 elections a lot of people were defending bill clinton, probably trying to make sure hilary would win. And to be fair it seems like there is a lot more evidence that clinton was close to Epstein than trump. Altough if Trump has played a part in the whole Epstein thing then he should go to jail.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>reddit is the same wether you like it or not. It is an echo chamber using algorithm just like youtube or facebook designed to make you see the things that you want to see. This is actualy the problem with most big websites right now. They complain that people are getting more polarized yet they don't understand that the very algorithms that they create are the biggest reason why this happens. They will make you suggestion based on your history and what you like, so you end up only seeing what you want to see and being surrounded by people who think just like you.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>the thing i found weird was the story of how it happened. They say she was tied down and they were hitting her in the face, but i was really interested in the Epstein case and saw a lot of stuff about it. I don't recall any other time a girl accused Epstein of tying her to a bed or hitting her... i just tought this story seemed wildly different from what the other girls have said happened to them. Seems to me like Epstein was more the massage type, not the BDSM type. Then again maybe he did that to other people and they just have not come out to talk about it so what do i know. I just think this one seems differents from the other girl's stories. I also think it is weird that a guy like Epstein who had literally like 5 or 6 different underage girls a day would feel the need to have sex with the same girl trump had sex with like minutes later. Personally the last thing i would want to have sex with is something that had trump's dick in it ten minutes before. Especialy if i have many other options. Anyway i hope it is not true because that would be horrible and i hope if it is true that all the people who were involved get what they deserve.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>i work as a specialist in digital marketing, so making people see what they want to see is what i do for a living. Maybe i see it worst than it is because of that, but if you saw the kind of things that google and facebook are able to do with your data you would fall of your chair. Prediction algorithms are getting so precise it is scary. I mean this is how they make money, they have to make sure that they can determine what you will click on next in order to sell advertising to companies. If you start to think that the hearth is flat and all of a sudden flat hearth articles keep popping up in your screen i think you are far more likely to end up believing this stuff instead of having to actively look for it.

Following the same logic isin't white supremacy an ideology too? to simply put it white supremacy means you believe white people are better... sounds like an ideology to me. And even if it was, a lot of people are doing horrible things in the name of Antifa so why not condemn it?</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I used to Smoke about an ounce per week of hash loll one of the method that works is first dont buy big quantity, you think you will save money but you wont. When you have a lot it always seems like you have so much left that you end up smoking twice as much. Also you can but one of those thing they sell in drugstores to put your pills for the month with each day having a container. Just put whatever amount you want to Smoke and stick to it.</TEXT>
