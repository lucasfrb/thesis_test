    <TITLE>Counter Collector -- Proliferate deck -- MtG Arena</TITLE>
    <DATE>2019-05-25 14:14:03</DATE>
    <TEXT>Hi everyone! Here's my video, showcasing a green/white deck focusing on proliferating. It's taken me from the bottoms of Gold rank all the way to Platinum where it's struggling a bit more right now, but I've achieved Platinum Two at the time that I'm writing this. If you're like me and you refuse to play Red Aggro and other well-established decks, this is something you could try! Green/White [Counter Collector](https://youtu.be/9OiC40vzcB8) deck. Decklist (also featured in the video) (and not optimized because wildcards): 3x Pelt Collector 1x Shaper's Sanctuary 4x Grateful Apparition 1x Triumph of Gerrard 1x Bond of Flourishing 2x Merfolk Branchwalker 2x Pollenbright Druid 2x Huatli's Raptor 1x Emissary of Sunrise 1x Gideon Blackblade 2x Courage in Crisis 1x Evolution Sage 1x Pledge of Unity 4x Ixalan's Binding 1x Settle the Wreckage 1x Shalai, Voice of Plenty 1x The Wonderer 2x Bloom Hulk 1x Ajani, The Greathearted 1x God-Eternal Oketra 1x Nissa, Who Shakes the World 2x Hungering Hydra 10x Plains 11x Forest 2x Sunpetal Grove 1x Temple Garden</TEXT>

    <TITLE>My 1st custom MtG set: King's River.</TITLE>
    <DATE>2019-05-29 09:18:05</DATE>
    <TEXT>Hello all, I hope I'm not breaking any rules or pissing anyone off. I've been working on my first ever custom MtG set and have been looking for places to share it to get some feedback. It's in a very early stage at the moment. I just decided on the commons that I will print tonight to playtest over the weekend. H[ere's the link to my blog](https://saigongeeks.com/category/geek-stuff/mtg-custom-set-kings-river/) where I will house any updates.  #8203; If you're interested in giving constructive criticism or just like to look at Magic cards, I hope you'll give it a look.  #8203; Here's more information, if you're interested but don't want to click the link just yet! The set inspiration comes from my homebrew D amp;D world which is itself inspired by where I live at the moment (Vietnam) and the Ixalan set. What does that mean? Imagine if instead of attempting to colonize Vietnam, the French had ended up in "the new world", and instead of the Americas, the continent would have been a fantastic South-East Asia, where Dinosaurs still roamed. However, while lost at sea, only a few ships arrived in "Vietnam" and the survivors were rescued by the local population, where they grew side by side for hundreds of years, the two cultures mixing. Prior to that, an epic war between Elves, Orcs and the armies of a black dragon had taken place. (On the art, it's quite hard to find medieval fantasy art that reflects ASEA flavors. Also, I haven't kept track or where I found my art, so I'm sorry but I don't have the artists' names for now). The colors, their tribes, and their mechanics (I'll start with White, being at the top of the color wheel and also the home of my players in the D amp;D campaign, and go clockwise from there):  #8203; White - King's River. Humans and mostly everything else. Rice farmers and European knights. Their mechanic: Reserves. Basically if an opponent controls more creatures than you, you can pump out 1/1 tokens. Blue - Magical Rainforest. Mutated orcs following the Aquamancer. Slippery - Stuff happens if your creatures get blocked or targeted. Black - Kokusho. A black dragon and his armies of goblins, lizardmen and humans. Corrupt - Turn other creatures to black, to then take control of them, boost them or sacrifice them. Red - The Free Lands. Anything "chaotic". Gnolls, orcs, free men. Roam - Lands matter. If you or your opponents control different-colored lands, you get bonuses. Green - The Elves of the Queen's Grove. A race in decline fighting fiercely. Ambush - If your opponent's power or toughness total is higher than yours, you get bonuses.  #8203; The set's total number at the moment (including lands) sits at 299. I was aiming at 306 because that's what Ravnica: City of Guilds had and that was my favorite block. I'm mostly following advice from Mark Rosewater and his great Nuts and Bolts series and am doing this for fun and as an educational hobby, because I've been dreaming of designing my own board games for years now.  #8203; Thanks for reading!</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Hi! Welcome to your new addiction. It depends on a few things. 1- Are you extremely competitive, or do you like to just have fun sometimes? 2- Do you care about the cards' flavor? Their backstory, the plane they're from, the art? 3- Are you a collector? Do you want to see your collection grow over time?  #8203; If you're extremely competitive, you probably will not want to learn mechanics and combos on your own. That means you have a lot of reading to do, which is neat because you are in 2019 and there are tons of great resources to help you. A single Google search will provide a lot of help. If you care about the flavors, find the blocks and sets you like and buy their products. For example, I never really cared about Dominaria but I'll buy anything from Ravnica. if you don't care about the flavor, then go for mechanic. Look up what fits your playstyle and find cards that can help you achieve the gameplay style you want. If you're a collector, you can buy random boxes of commons and uncommons on ebay and start that way. Maybe you can also trade with your friends to build your collection. You can buy booster packs and experience the rush of opening them. There's a reason we call it cardboard crack. If you're not a collector, after you've done your research and know what you want to play, go to your brick and mortar store and buy the specific cards you need.  #8203; I hope this was helpful!</TEXT>

    <TITLE>King #8217;s River MtG devlog 1</TITLE>
    <DATE>2019-06-16 02:50:31</DATE>
    <TEXT>Hello everyone! Lower down the post is my actual blog article so you don't need to click the link if you don't want to. I've been diligently working on my own custom set for about a month, which is set in my homebrew DnD world. I think I'm breaking a few subreddit rules but I hope you'll forgive me (mainly, I have no artist credits on my blog - if you know/recognize anyone's work, please point it out and I'll make the adjustments). This post is not about cards, it's more of a devlog. I talk quickly about the mistakes I've made early on. I plan on making this a regular series to help new set designers with a tiny bit of advice - stuff I wish I had known when I started. Thanks for reading! I'm open to constructive criticism! If you enjoyed the article, feel free to visit my blog for more stuff. If not, all good. # [King #8217;s River MtG devlog #160;1](https://saigongeeks.com/2019/06/15/kings-river-mtg-devlog-1/)  #128247; Hello everyone, hope you all had a good week. This week #8217;s post will be about keeping you all up to date with the development of a custom Magic: the Gathering set so that hopefully, future amateur designers who are looking for help, guidance or advice can get some insights that I couldn #8217;t find when I got started. ### First part: An overall update. So as things usually go, my Magic Custom Set design has slowed down a lot. Not from losing steam, mind you #8230; Just that work has started to pick up so I have less time for non-lucrative activities such as this. That and also, following Mark Rosewater #8217;s advice, I should be doing a hecking lot of playtesting of my set #8217;s commons before moving on to the next step. Unlike Wizards of the Coast however, I don #8217;t have a team of enthusiastic MtG players waiting to do just that. I have exactly two friends that I both enjoy playing MtG with and trust with their insight as well, so opportunities to meet and playtest are few and far between. *Let me specify so I don #8217;t hurt anyone #8217;s feelings: I have more friends than these two, and I respect their opinion, but they #8217;re either inexperienced in MtG, or play in a way that I #8217;m not interested in (heavy control).* I still work on the set every day. I #8217;ve just scratched my entire uncommons and rares because they were designed very early on and don #8217;t really fit anymore. To keep moving forward, I try to design one interesting card a day. Much like a writer #8217;s daily minimum word count, it creates a beneficial habit. At the time of writing this, the set is sitting at **Commons Iteration 3.0**with a playtest happening tomorrow, while I #8217;m continuing to add cards by designing the uncommons in a vertical cycle manner (from the bottom up). ### Second part: Things learned from the first playtest. A few weeks ago already, I managed to sit down and play a few games with [The Blankard](https://saigongeeks.com/2019/05/29/an-intro/). We also ended up making a few dumb videos to practice editing, which you can watch [here](https://youtu.be/1BHucldYpTk). Here #8217;s what we found: Green and White are too passive. Sure, that adjective is associated with these colors, but after all the goal of an MtG duel is to kill your opponent. This passiveness was attributed to me trying to find my feet and thinking too much about how Commons should help Uncommons, instead of making sure that Commons could function on their own. Green had too much ramping and high toughness, nothing aggressive. White had a lot of ways to prevent damage but not much offense. Black on the other end, works well already and has lots of synergy with itself and other colors. It #8217;s the color that I re-worked the least. Blue is strong. That #8217;s the actual note I wrote hehe. Blue was hard to stop and worked well at a Commons level already, although you can #8217;t really feel the flavor of the set in it so I decided to re-design most of the cards. Red is aggro. Well, that #8217;s what it #8217;s supposed to do, right? Actually Red seemed to be having a bit of a tough time by itself, but mixed with White it kicked serious ass (against the other, unbalanced colors). I actually decided to scrap the entire present mechanic for Red as it didn #8217;t seem to make much sense game-wise. On a more important note though, all the cards feel repetitive and the flavor takes too much place compared to the mechanics. For me, that meant a serious lack of creativity and foresight but it also shows my early mindset:  #8220;Let #8217;s make a quick MtG set to make my D amp;D campaign deeper #8221;. In the end, I #8217;ve realized that more than anything, I want to make a balanced set which will be fun to play and offer a bit of originality in the world of Magic: the Gathering. I intend to share my design road map, progress, mistakes and eventually share the whole set in an easily printable manner for people to enjoy. I want it to be *draftable.* ### Third part: The endgame. I #8217;d be lying if I said I was making this for pure pleasure #8230; but it wouldn #8217;t be a big lie. I #8217;m learning tons in ways of game design, game balance, organizational skills and diligence. Lastly, I #8217;m secretly hoping that doing all this hard work will bring a bit more attention to the blog and the YouTube channel so that all the time I spend on my hobbies could also bring in a bit of money to support myself and my family. I #8217;d love to collaborate or contribute on projects of the nerdy/geeky kind with other creators. Hopefully, showing my worth and building up experience will amount to something one day. That #8217;s all for today. The next installment will most likely talk about the lessons I have learned designing a custom MtG set and offer a handful of links to articles that should help a fellow custom set designer. In the meantime, feel free to add your own advice, ask questions or comment below. If you think one of your friends would benefit from reading this, don #8217;t be afraid to share the post! See ya!</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Thanks for writing this! Yeah, even if I have a decade of MtG experience, I realize that I know very little about balance. I made that mechanic to try and emulate the Jump move from the FF games. I want to playtest a bit more before I share the set but I'm happy to share more cards! I won't share them on this here subreddit however since I'm breaking the rule of no artist credit.</TEXT>

    <TITLE>Making a custom MtG set: Where to start</TITLE>
    <DATE>2019-06-18 02:10:28</DATE>
    <TEXT>Hi everyone! In an effort to make more content about custom mtg available, I've decided to start writing a weekly blog of my own debacles. Here's this week's post. It's missing the 2nd half since I haven't had the free time to find the artist names for the art I'm using. I hope you enjoy it!  #8203; Here goes: So you want to start designing your own custom MtG set. You have an idea for the setting and you #8217;ve made a bunch of original cards which your friends think are neat. Great. Now create 250 more cards #8230; daunting, right? Here #8217;s what I figured out for myself after a few evenings spent scratching my head staring at Magic Set Editor: you don #8217;t need to re-invent the (color) wheel. Pick a set you like, which has the closest feel to the one you want to create. Go on that set #8217;s Wiki. Look at the cycles, mechanics, mirrored cards. Think about why you like that set exactly. For me, at first it was  #8220;[Guilds of Ravnica](https://mtg.gamepedia.com/Guilds_of_Ravnica) #8221; because I loved the guilds, setting and mechanics introduced in that set, but after a bit of research I realized my goals were more in line with [Shadowmoor](https://mtg.gamepedia.com/Shadowmoor), because in my set colors and tribes matter in a similar way. Okay, you #8217;ve looked at the wiki. Then, pull up the cards list for that set. Look through them. Find the most common basic cards for each color. The ones we seem to see in every block #8230; Then copy them. Add them to your set. Let's face it, designing rares is where the fun #8217;s at. Copying commons will help you fill out some annoying holes and help you move forward. You can always go back later and put your little twist on them, but at least for now you #8217;ll have 5 slots filled already. After all, commons are the most #8230; #160;*common* card in your set, the ones you need to design the most of. Having done this, I can rest easy knowing that each color #8217;s pillar of foundation is secured. Believe me, it #8217;s a load off my mind. I #8217;d like to keep my posts snack-size so I #8217;ll stop this one here. As always, if you have suggestions for the cards, any comments or just want to chat, or if you know the artists who drew the art I used feel free to write something in the comments below! Thanks for reading. *Edit: Adapted for Reddit* *Link to full blog post:* [https://saigongeeks.com/2019/06/18/making-a-custom-mtg-set-where-to-start/](https://saigongeeks.com/2019/06/18/making-a-custom-mtg-set-where-to-start/)</TEXT>

Basically, the set is based in my homebrew D amp;D campaign where Kokusho (controlled by a long-distance player) is attempting to become a god by sacrificing creatures after he's corrupted them (yes, there are Bolas parallels).  #8203; I just want to know if the grammar makes sense. I'm still working on the mechanics. Thanks a lot!</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Thanks a million times for your time. First of all, my apologies for omitting the artist's credits on the card. While I've been playing MtG for a long time, writing as opposed to reading cards is quite different and represents a huge challenge for me. So thank you for taking the time to write detailed explanations. I'm making this set as a sort of stand-alone status in mind, but it's true that color behavior and personalities must be respected. However I also want the cards to match what is happening in my D amp;D campaign, which is that a black dragon has started a cult and if the followers believe in him strongly enough, their skin/fur/scales turn ebony black. Once so, if enough of them sacrifice themselves in his name, Kokusho believes he will attain godhood. A mistake on my part is to not have removed the P/T on the 2nd card. Another problem I'm facing is how to represent his corruption in a fun in-game mechanic. At the moment black plays like this: take control of creatures shortly or affect only black, or non-black creatures, and sacrifices play a big part. I don't want Kokusho to lead an army of zombies... so Corrupt was my way to bend the color wheel a bit, with Black becoming manipulative for its own ends. Back to the drawing board I guess... or I could simply make Kokusho's deck a blue/black color combo?</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Hi again everyone. First of all I'd like to thank this community for the help with the few cards I've been sharing here. As the title suggests this is my second post about designing a custom magic set for the first time. I'm no expert in the matter, far from it, and these are my blunders. I'm also sharing the text here so you don't have to click the link if you don't feel like it. If you're curious and have free time however, when you're done feel free to go visit our blog. As new creators, a single extra view a week is so motivating!  #8203; Without further delay, here goes: # [Custom MtG devlog #2: First lesson #160;learned](https://saigongeeks.com/2019/06/29/custom-mtg-devlog-lessons-learned-1/)  #8203; So, turns out designing a Magic: The Gathering custom set is deep. Real deep. Deep *af.* *Duh*, I can hear you say. When I first boldly declared to my friends that I was going to design a set, I wasn #8217;t really aware of the grandeur of the task, or the foolishness of my words. I thought I knew enough about the game already, that I just needed to sit down for a few sessions, make cool new cards with art found online and call it day. More than a month later and here we are: I #8217;ve hardly finished the commons (which are a mess), I #8217;ve only dipped my toes in the pool of uncommons and deleted an entire set once. It feels like I haven #8217;t progressed at all but I know I clocked over 100 hours on this already. Even more deflating, my mechanics have tons of problems. Let #8217;s not dwell too much on the negatives. More importantly than MtG lore and mechanics, I #8217;ve learned tons in game design, balancing, and MtG bits and bobs which took my fanboy level to new heights and will surely help me down the line with other creative hobbies (I #8217;d eventually like to create adventures, modules and settings for tabletop games). I also realized how *little* I actually know about MtG. To spare you the details of my geek/nerd life I won #8217;t go too deep but I will say this: there are not one, but **two** 10-year gaps during which I played absolutely **no** MtG. None. That, coupled with the fact I was never a power-gamer and didn #8217;t really care about the lore means that I missed out on a lot of things which have now been thrown at my face at rapid speeds all day, every day for the last few weeks. Cycles. Mirrored pairs. Evergreens. Balance. Mark Rosewater. The list goes on. After sitting down and creating 100 cards randomly, mostly based on art I felt represented my set, I realized that I needed to worry about mana curve or the number of creatures vs other spells; color personalities, rarities and a whole other buttload of stuff which straight-up gave me a panic attack more than once. **The first lesson I learned was to start at the beginning.** Duh, duh, say you. Well, what #8217;s the beginning anyway? Turns out it #8217;s more complicated than I thought. Actually, the very first lesson I learned was to: **Figure out your beginning!** What #8217;s your main source of inspiration for this custom set? Is it the **lore**? Is it the **art**? Is it an idea for a **mechanic** or a **faction**? Are you creating a custom set to build upon an already existing, official set or are you tackling it as a stand-alone kit? You need to figure all these out yes, but not right at the very start. Firstly, You need to pinpoint your muse because if you don #8217;t, you #8217;ll end up like me with about 6 or 7 different ideas all competing for space at the same time and none of the concepts being pulled off in a convincing manner. A simple thing you can do to help you start is to figure out if you #8217;re designing from the **top down**, or **the bottom up**. Again, I #8217;ll let you do your own research on this simply because there are easily findable articles already written on the subject by much more knowledgeable people than me #8230; safe for one link lower down this wall of text. At the moment, my biggest problem is that I don #8217;t have an **overarching mechanic** for my set. Each color has its own separate mechanic and cares a bit about creature types, a bit about color, and a bit about total power. One faction relies heavily on tokens, while the other loves +1 counters. I thought it was fine since I #8217;m still playtesting and I #8217;m trying to figure out what #8217;s the most fun part of my cards but I #8217;m creating a lot of extra work for myself and ignoring any kind of connection that could happen between all colors to unify the set. One evening, after staring at my list pointlessly for a few minutes, I realized I was tackling the problem the wrong way. Cart-before-the-bulls type of way. I turned the computer off. I went to bed phone in hand, and googled  #8220;designing a custom MtG set #8221;, and started reading. From the search results, a link emerged which helped me immensely. It was called: [Putting Your Eggs in Your Basket: Designing a Custom Set.](https://www.mtgsalvation.com/articles/16051-putting-your-eggs-in-your-basket-designing-a) Clicking this link really did propel me forward but also brought me to the edge of an abyss that I was not brave enough to fully stare into: the fabulous world of competitive custom MtG. These maniacs are actually playing custom modern, custom standard! More importantly, the article referred is amazing. I won #8217;t explain what it is because I really think you ought to read it, especially if you #8217;re new to the universe of Custom MtG. Let #8217;s just say it #8217;ll save you a lot of head-scratching and a couple of late-night hours. At the time of writing this, I #8217;ve realized thanks to helpful redditors over at [r/custommagic/](https://www.reddit.com/r/custommagic/) #160;that my main black mechanic isn #8217;t a black mechanic at all but more akin to blue spells #8230; which is sort of a huge relief as I feel like I can drop the  #8220;colors matter #8221; aspect of my set to focus more on a  #8220;tribes matter #8221; feel. Back to the design board again, with renewed fervor! May your opening hands be balanced.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Hi all, thanks for your time. I'm designing a custom set that takes place in my homebrew D amp;D campaign and I was wondering about this: What would be the best way to include half-orcs and half-elves in the set? At the moment I just created them as a new creature type but it complicates some mechanics. Would you find it acceptable to have a "Human Orc Warrior" creature instead of a "Half-Orc Warrior"?</TEXT>

    <TEXT>You could have them manage NPCs.. hire mercenaries or have them take a squire under their wing... or they could hire fighting dogs or domesticated wolves or something? Just make sure the "Assistants" are less powerful/cool than their own characters. Alternatively, if you look back at DnD 4e, they had a little mechanic I always loved where they had "critters", monsters that didn't have full HP. To make the fights more cinematic you could have, say, an orc leading some goblins and the lil gobbos only have 1 hp and deal 1 dmg... it's not much but it could make the players feel a bit powerful. As long as you don't throw a 100 at them haha.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I never played competitively and stepped off the game after Lorwyn. I only just recently started getting back into it due to MtG Arena (I play daily and have spent a total of $5 in 4 months) and now that MtG is finally affordable in Vietnam I just went to my 1st ever pre-release event. I actually felt stupid paying for this event. For someone like me who doesn't own any paper magic anymore (left my cards with my friends when I left Canada 5 years ago) the packs you get from the event are far from enough to make anything interesting. $200 on a deck? No thanks. Like OP said I'd rather spend it on an aquarium or one of those new Warhammer boxes, for example. Now, everybody has their preference and WotC doesn't owe me shit (well, I disagree but anyhoo) but it makes me wonder where this is all heading to.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Hi everyone! Making a comeback to the hobby after a 10-year break. This is my attempt at a low-tech planted freshwater tank. The tank has been cycled and something neat is if I turn off the airstone, after a few hours the biggest plants will start pearling! The female betta was previously in a vase but she looked bored so I moved her in there a few minutes ago. Currently keeping a close eye on her. She likes to pick on the cory pandas but they can outswim her. The cardinal neon tetras and other fish (I think?) Were added 24 hours ago. I want to add a few more fish (maybe platies) next weekend. I'm running two cylinder filters. No heater as it's pretty much 28c all year long here. I live in Vietnam so all the fish names are in Vietnamese, if anyone could help me with the fish and plant names I'd appreciate it!</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Hi! My tank was custom-made, 90 cm large by 30 cm high by 40 cm deep. I made it shallow because I read that this way, the light can really hit the plants and you don't need CO2 to help them grow. So all in all, 100 litres/30 gallons. For the names, yes that algae eater with the black stripe (after a bit of research I feel like it's a Otocinclus Catfish) and the sucker fish with the camo at the end. I have a pair of them and it looks like they were grooming earlier, super cool!</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I copied the deck of someone who posted a 12-0 record here and got mana screwed. Then I went for my Elementals deck which I had tested the "fake" event from last week which got me 5-0... and was mana-screwed. I faced a mono-red aggro and a bake that cat deck, respectively. It's the 1st time in a long time that I've thrown objects at the wall violently.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I'm not an expert but I thought a bit of Nitrate is okay, not deadly like Ammonia and Nitrite. To be honest, I got in the hobby by getting a betta in a vase and seeing as I could never got the Nitrate down I decided to get a bigger tank with a proper filter. My betta was "fine" in much, much higher nitrate. Maybe get the opinion of other people but I'd say it's safe to bring him home if you take your time transferring him to the new tank!</TEXT>

    <TEXT>This is my first time playing a game of the sort and I'm hooked but it's been 7 days and I'm already fatigued. I WANT to spend money but the "deals" are just unattractive. Let me buy one orange shard a day for $2 and ya got me. Bought two blue shards at $1 and it just left me wondering why I would ever do that again. My pulls were so bad. Even after finishing the campaign on Normal, that shard I got gave me the most useless rare character... Totally killed it for me. I'm exploring this game because it's a new style for me (first phone that can handle this kind of game) but I feel like unless there's big changes, there's nothing interesting in this game... I actually feel like it's simply preying on gambling addicts.</TEXT>

Actually the black and blue Betta picks on the one with fins a bit, the guppies mostly just play in the current. I live in Vietnam and sometimes here the females are kept in buckets outside the shop all together with no separation so I guess they're already used to company?</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I'm considering making a video on why should NOT start playing this game. I'm a F2P, but mostly because I find the "deals" absolutely absurd and an insult to my mollusk intelligence. I've only been playing for 10 days. The first 2 days, I couldn't put it down. This was my first time playing a highly-polished mobile game like this and the new style was really refreshing. I thought it was a good time-killer. I tried buying that $1 blue shard to see if I enjoyed giving them my money and I got absolute crap, the three times. Then I look at $40, $60 deals and I get a real sick feeling in my stomach, that this is just people preying on other people who have a gambling addiction. The game is beautiful and really deep, but now that I'm trying to get my second hero to 5 stars and my starter to 6 stars, the grind is just so repetitive and the paywall too high for me to cross. Some people would say "Raid doesn't owe you anything", well that's true but a deal is usually two ways. If I see nothing beneficial for me, then I won't spend any money on it. I've already stopped caring about spending all my energy before going to bed. I saw a post on the FB group, of a dude who spent $300 to get started and didn't even get a Legendary hero. He was asking for advice on how to get his money back. I've never played this type of games before but for me, every package should be 50% the price it is now, or there should be better drop rates. I know the point of the game is to collect hard to find heroes but come on. I've been farming that level 11 for 3 days straight now with no drop on that good dude.</TEXT>

    <DATE>2019-10-28 09:03:40</DATE>
    <TEXT>Hi everyone, I have a 30 gallon tank with neons and a few other fish, and two female bettas. One of them isn't interested in eating anything, not even frozen blood worms. All she eats are the algae pellets I put in for my bottom feeders. I lost my previous female betta from what looked like constipation at the time and I'm worried this one will go the same way if she keeps eating only that. My fish enjoy a variety of foods so every week I give them a bit of dried worms, flake food, tetra pellets and frozen blood worms, but that one female betta only goes for the algae pellets. Even if I drop her some food privately while the other fish are distracted. Suggestions? PS I live in Vietnam and the food diversity we have here is a bit more limited than elsewhere. Thanks for reading!</TEXT>

    <TEXT>The other one is the dominant one yes. I don't have a second tank at the moment but I could set one up, but it would need to cycle first. I was hoping that having a line of tall plants in the middle of the tank would cut the line of sight and help everyone relax. Someone suggested adding a third betta in but I feel like that would just cause even more bullying?</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I took a chance and got a third betta last week and it did change the whole dynamic, for the better. The new betta (Boken) started picking on the most aggressive one of the two previous occupants, and in turn, the softest one has started picking on Boken, so there's a sort of rock-paper-scissors dynamic going on and it's kind of hilarious.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Quick update if anyone was reading: it was a hookworm. The fish died a few days after I filmed this video. One of my bettas now has one near her dorsal fin. I bought some medicine and immediately after starting the treatment, a huge white worm came out of one of my other platies. It's the third day of the treatment and just like the instructions in the medicine box said, the present hookworm has turned white. It will apparently fall of in the next 2-3 days.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I haven't had that many problems with bugs, but the game is so underwhelming for me that it's hard to comprehend. It feels like a GoT Season 8 to me. A lot of the mechanics are annoying and the enemies are just annoying, not challenging. Mind control, equipment break, map-wide targeting on turn 1... those are not challenges. They're just boring, cheap mechanics that turn people into save scums. I got so engrossed in the X-com 2 story that even when my troops died, most of the time I wouldn't load the last turn, just because I wanted the game to be meaningful. Speaking of which, where's the story in this game? A bit of nice art and voice-overs and BAM back to the same missions and the same maps. Wish I could get my money back.</TEXT>

I've been playing D amp;D 5e for a year and just got my PF2e book and have been making characters non-stop, whereas in 5e it felt like every Fighter would be sort of the same, for example. The time it takes to roll a character is much longer, however.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Hello, I live in Vietnam, so Play by Post seems ideal for me. That would be a first, as well. I have experience with 3.5, 4e, 5e, PF1 and am DYING to try out PF2. I've DMed PF1 a bit so I'm happy to help with rules (I have the core book 2e sitting next to me) but I'm mostly looking to be a player rather than a DM. That being said, I don't mind helping with rules and world building.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Hi everyone, As the title suggests, I live in Vietnam and am looking to join either an online or offline group to play Pathfinder 2e with as a player. I'm a 35-year old geek with free time who has been playing PF1 and D amp;D 5e for the last 2 years and wants to try out the new edition and to play with new people as my previous group's schedule is impossible to match. I'm open-minded and like light RPing but wouldn't mind a more intensive RPing group.</TEXT>

    <TITLE>Rekiel the Elf Monk</TITLE>
    <DATE>2020-01-09 12:44:56</DATE>
    <TEXT>Hello everyone, After weeks of having the Core Rulebook by my side and not opening it due to its daunting size, a few days ago I finally gave it a look and I've since rolled a multitude of characters. I'm loving the process of rolling characters in this edition. Something about it helps my imagination going. I'm also playing Jedi Fallen Order at the moment, so I decided to try to emulate a Force-User for my new Play-by-Post sessions. Please find the character sheet attached [here.](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1gwe207supfXppyXMSbFkug_Lw6JQW8SZ) A bit of details and the ideology behind it: Rekiel is a Whisper Elf of the Hermit (Occult) ancestry. He sits at the respectable age of 501. For as long as he can remember, he's lived in a monastery built inside a giant cave and has been training, meditating, and learning about the culture and language of Dwarves, as his best friend at the monastery was a Dwarf. There were other Elves at the monastery however, so Rekiel retained a strong connection to his ancestry. The monastery is dedicated to the study of the Ki Force and has the feel of a cult (hence the occult background). Rekiel is trained in unarmed combat, and chose the Nunchaku as his weapon of choice. As the order is dedicated to neutrality and balance, with a weapon must come a defense, and so these monks carry shields with them as well. Rekiel is able to hurl small objects at will (Otherwordly Magic - Telekinetic Projectile) due to his connection to the ki force. He likes to carry caltrops around as impromptu projectile weapons. Far from strong physically, Rekiel is however very quick, nimble and agile and is good at avoiding his adversary's attacks - they often seem to get snagged in his robes or tangled in his nunchakus' chains. He excels at Acrobatics and moving quietly. As his order tries to remain a neutral force and to keep their emotions in check, he's not very well versed in diplomacy or influencing people. Recently, something terrible has happened at his monastery - while Rekiel was performing his duties of keeping the temple and altars clean, a sacred relic was stolen from under his very nose. With the blessing of the head monk, he donned black robes - representing his shame - and was allowed to leave the monastery for the first time in his life, in search of the relic's thief. The first rays of sunlight that caught his eye hurt him, but after weeks out in the grand, open world, Rekiel has grown accustomed and even started enjoying this warmth and the touch of the elements like the wind, although he often misses the quiet stillness of his cave monastery. Meta-speaking, I'm not sure if I'll keep him as a pure monk or eventually dip into Cleric or Druid as a Jedi, or maybe dip into Barbarian to represent his struggle with the Dark Side. Edit: Why downvotes? Did I break some rule? Edit 2: Character sheet re-uploaded. I changed him a little bit. More importantly I took away the Otherworldy Magic feat, as with the errata it made it less enticing. I also gave him a bit more strength so he can dip into Barbarian at level 2. I made that choice simply because I'm playing him in a new campaign and that's what I want to play. Thanks for all your help guys.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Sounds to me like you had friends who mostly just wanted to hang out together with you, which in itself is really nice. No clue how that lasted for 4 years if they couldn't bother reading the rules. I can barely hold my groups' attention for more than a few months and they always tell me "it was fun" and "you're a good DM". I'm having a similar problem. My group has changed a lot over the last 3 years, it's mostly been me begging people I know to try out the game and one player joining most of it. He started as a "What's my AC" guy and asked that question for at least 4 sessions AS A FIGHTER until I pretty much insulted his intelligence in a gamble to make him read the rules, which didn't work. I made little action cards with an MtG card editor and he understood everything instantly, once it was in bite-size form. The dude has evolved into a great player and RPer and is my favorite person to play PF or 5e with. As it is, I've accepted my faith as the DM of one-shots. I just use all of it to worldbuild. That player started a mercenary agency and we just explain to new players that they start out as his recruit. He uses the gold to improve his building, and when his main character got a few levels too high compared to the newbies, he rolled a new mercenary as well. My problem is mostly playing with people who come from 2e and cannot adapt to the new rules and cannot "go along" with the group or the rails. Are we playing "let's argue what to do?" Or are we actually gonna go down the crypt and slay some shit?</TEXT>

I still bring my weak decks to the table and try to learn the combos but it seems to me that cEDH is sort of the same for everyone... Go online, look at the combos, get the cards like you read to. Meanwhile I'm stuck in my old-school mentality of making fun tribal decks that don't really combo off and are basically a joke hehe.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>That's true, and that's one aspect of the game I haven't understood at all - that and politics, which usually works against my favor because I can't be bothered to make alliances. At the moment I'm stuck intrigued by the whole format and how deep it is, but wondering if I as a player want to, or even can, play at that level. If I were to play with my friends' cEDH decks that have been kicking my ass, I probably wouldn't be able to use them properly. The guy took 5 minutes to tappity-tap-untap stuff in front of him and after a bit went "ah, unlimited turns", and while it was impressive, it felt more like watching someone play solitaire. I'm finding that I have to straight-up adopt a new personality to play this game hehehe. Not giving up yet, but waaaay out of my league when it comes to cEDH.</TEXT>

In my newest campaign, no evil characters are allowed. Period.

Another one was perched at the top of my tree branch, it's body a bit out of the water, and a third one was just floating around to the point where I thought it was dead. Do they usually do this? Mine were always hiding in the grassy area at the bottom before that. Maybe now that they're bigger and don't get harrassed by my bettas they are more free to do what they want? I also noticed that a looooot of tiny snails that must have been hiding in the substrate have started crawling near the surface. Last time I saw this, I had a bacterial bloom shortly after, followed by a Nitrate cycle. Only thing is, this tank is 6 months old. I tested the water 2 days ago and everything was at 0... Ammonia, Nitrate and Nitrites... which worries me a bit since I prefer to have my Nitrites at around 5.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Okay. I'm not an expert so I would recommend checking some Youtube channels, but for me it's when the flow of water starts being affected. The thing is you usually want to keep the old filter for the bacteria. So when you do your water change, maybe once a month, use the tank water you just took out and rinse the filter in it. If you use tap water the chemicals in it will kill all the good bacteria. Let me know if you have any questions! I'll try to help but again, not an expert.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Air stone was on all night and the fish were way more active today, and no exodus to the surface this time. Another I just realized is that last month I had an outbreak of black algae so I had reduced the time the light was on by a lot. That might affect the plants. Now the algae's under control so I also set the light's timer back to a more normal cycle.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Hi! There doesn't seem to be rules frowning upon shameless self-promotion so here goes! I got the PF 2e hardcover core book a few months ago and due to its sheer size, I was scared to crack it open for a long time. A few weeks ago I finally did open it and besides getting instantly addicted to the perfect smell of its pages, I haven't been able to stop making characters. One of my hobbies is my Youtube channel. I used to post character ideas on my blog but recently decided to try the video format. I fucking love 2e Hobgoblins and decided to record myself making a build. It's not optimized. There's no character sheet. I hope you enjoy it!</TEXT>

The book/material is very intimidating at first but the character sheet, way to make characters (no dice rolls) were very intuitive. We still have a lot of questions regarding rules but not looking back at all. I rolled a 5e Fighter to be a player in a campaign this week, and then I rolled a PF 2e Fighter to see the difference and I couldn't believe how little 5e offered.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Glad to have found this community! I've just started my own 2e campaign and after getting inspiration from a MtG Commander Myr deck I decided to throw my new players against an orc chieftain who just stole the means to make constructs from an artificer. After our second session I realized just how much work (and fun!) I had just created for myself homebrewing all this! I got my hands on the Pure Steam campaign setting and while draw heavily from there and from the rules to build monsters in the upcoming Game Master Guide. I'll post my progresses here if it interests anyone. Cheers!</TEXT>

    <TITLE>Need help with small outdoor balcony project</TITLE>
    <DATE>2020-02-27 14:35:16</DATE>
    <TEXT>Hello everyone! As the title says, I need help for a small project I have in mind. I'm moving to a small apartment and while I'm keeping my 30 gallon, I won't have any room for my dream betta tank, or a shrimp colony like I fantasize about. I will however have a sizeable balcony where I already plan to put plants. Here are some details: I live in Ho Chi Minh city, Vietnam. The sun will be beating down on the balcony for the 1st half of the day. Temperatures stay at 30c most of the year and drop to 22-25 during some odd weeks in the rainy season. That means that I'll need fish that are comfortable in warm waters (my current tank's water temperature has reached 32c a few times, when I'd forget to leave the fan blowing on the surface of the water). I'm thinking of a big ceramic pot with floating plants on it to create shade. I'd do water changes but I want to avoid anything to do with electricity, so no filter or water bubbles - if the plant system is enough. At the bottom of the pot I'd put substrate and rocks. Am I nuts? Is it possible? I'd need help with choosing the kind of fish, and the kind of plant I'd put in there. Thanks for your answers everyone.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I bought the physical Core rulebook to pass around the table but all my players just go on their phones when they have a question... The book is so thick, it intimidates them. They also have not read any of the rules. They just used Pathbuilder to make a character and stick to that, which makes combat pretty boring as they continuously ignore all the other options they can do, even if it means having a disadvantage. I personally like to have the book, when I have some time to kill I just pop it open or bring it with me to a coffee shop and read some random entry. The PDFs have th advantage that you can search through them easily in-session and you'd have way less things to carry to a game. My laptop acts as my DM screen, but when we played in a park I was glad to have the book.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Hi all! Just added a third female to my community tank. No name yet. Wife and I just moved and our budget is tight but I saw her at a local store for $2 and couldn't pass up the chance (I live in Sai Gon). I've had two females in the past and the dominant one bullied the shy one so I added a third one around last Halloween and it created a rock-paper-scissor (or pokemon) effect where they all kept each other in check. I unfortunately lost the last addition recently (she got stuck in a decoration, which has been removed) and the bully went back to her old habits so I decided to get a third one again. So far so good! I wonder how long it'll take for my wife to notice the new girl.</TEXT>

It reminds me of Warcraft 3. Reading the reviews however, some people complain that all units feel the same, races are not different and combat gets repetitive. Do you have a road map available for us to see, or could you tell us what's left to do on the game?</TEXT>

    <TEXT>The problem seems to be that we've had to deal with it since January and while China's cases appear to diminish, ours are starting to explode, and it's been 3 months already. How patient are people, really? Not that patient (I'm looking at you, person who burns the red light 6 seconds early) and a lot of people probably just wanna get back to their normal life (which isn't that different than now, to be honest). I'm the only one I know in my close circle who actually actively tries to self-isolate and I still mess up. I had to go pick up something in D1 today, that was my only outing of the day and I felt like it was too much. My wife, who haaates going out generally, and her family are at Aeon Mall every other day now, my super-introvert friend still goes to the coffee shop every morning, and all my expat friends just keep living life exactly the way they usually do. One of them had family over from Europe and the police showed up like, 2 days later at their apartment and advised them to self-quarantine. They went around the countryside and now he's having a party at his place. I didn't go. My Viet friends already barely went out at night so they haven't changed much of their habits, but they still go hang out 2-3 times a week in busy caf #233;s. I feel like shit's gonna hit the fan, foreigners are gonna get the blame for it, and it's gonna get ugly. One my friends was told by his neighbors in D1 to "not show his face" and that only his wife should go in and out of the house. If the businesses are not forced to close and that directive is not enforced (and I hate to say shit like that), I feel like we'll get a real epidemic in April. Stay safe, everyone.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>That's exactly the kind of stat I was looking for! Thanks. Indeed, if Hanoi has 4 million people and HCMC, 9 million, then there's 77 million people sort of unaccounted for, which worries me tons. My friends who moved back to their hometown say they do feel safer there and that people are taking it more seriously than in the cities. As for the small number of cases, things are starting to snowball now that it hit HCMC. As for the tourists, the government has been slowly taking visas away (they shut down all travels and imports from China back in January) and most flights have stopped I believe. That being said, I just went to a convenience store to buy some essentials and as soon as I walked in a security guard sprayed some disinfectant on my hands.</TEXT>

    <TITLE>Planting in a 1-year old fish tank</TITLE>
    <DATE>2020-03-27 03:28:21</DATE>
    <TEXT>Hello everyone, Like the title says, I want to know if I can plant seeds in an already flooded fish tank. I'm aware of the regular way to plant but my fish tank is one year old and I don't want to drain it. If it's possible but not optimal I'm still willing to try. If the seeds are just going to die, then I won't chance it. Thanks everyone!</TEXT>

    <TITLE>Apocalypse-themed deck?</TITLE>
    <DATE>2020-04-02 02:39:28</DATE>
    <TEXT>First of all I know I'm breaking a rule where I don't have a decklist because well, my current decklist is just all the rats and demons crammed in. I'm pretty bad at EDH so I came here to ask for assistance. Like the title says, I'm looking to make an apocalypse-themed mono-black deck. Here's the strategy I have in mind, it's nothing spectacular: Rats and tokens for blockers and to sacrifice for draw and mana, then pop out big demons. Also cards like Dictate of Erebos to gain something when I sacrifice rats. The wincon at the moment is mostly to have big flyers and keep swinging. I know that's not how you win in EDH but I just want to have some fun with friends. Thanks for your help! Edit: Here's the deck as it stands for now, very early version. I'm playtesting on Untap. It's fun to play but not very good yet. [http://tappedout.net/mtg-decks/end-of-manking/?cb=1585822953](http://tappedout.net/mtg-decks/end-of-manking/?cb=1585822953)</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Thanks for the suggestions! At the moment I want to keep it mono-black but I'll keep those in mind. I know the apocalypse is biblical but I don't think I'll add the four horsemen at the moment. I was imagining a wave of rats washing over the lands, with some sycophants worshipping demons until they come into reality :) As for budget, my group plays proxies (we live in Vietnam and there's not much access to cards) so budget is not an issue but we have a houserule that no single card can cost over $50, unless you happen to own it in real life.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>You know I rarely face them in my ranked, I don't know why. I think MtG gameplay on Arena is just ultra efficiency and that's not the kind of game I enjoy. I can reach Gold no problems every season but I rarely reach Platinum and when I do, I don't stay for long as I don't want to play the kinds of decks required to keep progressing in ranks, and the decks I see become repetitive after 1-2 days of the new set releases... Because with the internet, everyone has access to the ultra-efficient decklists and strategies. There's no more brewing. Only copying.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Ah I quit once already, I believe during the Shards of Alara set. I just got tired of constantly having to buy the newest cards because they seemed so much better than the previous set, constantly having to debate rules with friends, and basically I just played too much (almost every night for years) and I like change. I left all my cards with a friend when I quit (which he swears I said I "gave" to him) but I know he'll never sell them and that if I go back to it, I can use whatever's in our common collection to make decks. As my name suggests, I live in Vietnam now and we've only had real access to cards in the last year or two and I barely bought any cards. Lack of money is one reason, or rather, I'd rather spend it on something else. There's enough playgroups here with various playstyles, none of which I truly enjoy sitting with. Some of the players are my friends and I feel like we have a better time when there are no cards around us. Last year I was playing Arena a lot but the meta just bores me now. It's not a game I want to play anymore. Plus I feel like they're making too many new cards a year so the creativity and variety seem to take a hit. I did get into EDH right before the social distancing happened and had a bit of fun discovering a new aspect of MtG (and had a blast crafting decks, my favorite part of the hobby) but even then, playing with proxies or on Untap so there's no problem of card access, the game felt repetitive once again. Always the same decks, the same cards... sure it's a "deeper format" but down the line all the games I played came down to roughly the same strategies. I do find combos and cunning interesting for a bit but... Final nail is that I've always loved flavor and lore in the game but Ikoria's spoilers failed to excite me. After the disappointment of War of the Spark, I tread carefully. I must say that the Jumbo Commander set seems interesting but again, too many of the cards just seem like recycling or mixing of cards that have not even left Standard. Sometimes I wish they'd just reboot the whole thing, like Marvel and Ultimate Marvel, and take it slowly. I'm realizing MtG was never really for me. I looked up Back to Basics, seems like a really boring card to play, no offense to you. I tried Heartstone and Runeterra and I think MtG is better, much better. It'll probably never be bested. And yet, I find I'm having fun less and less often when I play it. As I'm writing this, I'm re-installing Arena, to give Ikoria a shot. I know full well I'll be deleting the game out of annoyance before the end of the day. Old habits die hard.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I've struggled with this as well. I added a house rule that players can't interact with other players' items (so he couldn't steal from other players every fucking time they go to sleep) and that made him pissy but that made him stop. He had ruined the previous campaign by constantly stealing to the point where the party organized behind his back IRL to in-game fuck him up, which they did. Picture a bunch of players cornering the Rogue after a difficult battle and just finishing him off then and there. It was kind of gruesome but I dug it. The following awkwardness was not really enjoyable however. I ended up dealing with boring Evil players by having the starting area of my last campaign be ruled by an Angel that casted a Detect Evil spell over the whole city and anything that detects as Evil is instantly delt with by the angel itself. To be honest, I dissolved my last play-group because of too much behind-the-scenes drama. Nothing too bad but when everyone complains to me about the other players' playstyles it simply takes the fun out of the game for me. We're talking about grown adults who can't understand when another player is RPing, or control freaks, or people IRL fake-sleeping during combat because they hate that aspect of the game. I'm almost fully giving up on the hobby. I feel like I'm mostly managing egos.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Every person involved seems to have a different expectation of what the game should be and sometimes it doesn't match, unfortunately. I'm in the same boat as you: my good and dedicated players' group dissolved over real-life drama and my 2nd group was so lazy that it just killed it for me. Concessions, I guess. I didn't mind that the fighter would still forget his AC in session 5, because he was writing up a lot of lore about his tribe between sessions keeping the group active. To help with the numbers part I first tried to highlight his AC, HP and weapon stats but that didn't work either, so in the end I made custom MtG cards of his attacks, movement, armor, etc and everything became clear for him after that. The last group knew all their stats but I guess just wanted to hang out 2-3 hours a week and shoot the shit, but that's not how I saw the game going so I put an end to it. Some moved to CoD Warzone, and 3 of us started Gloomhaven on TTS instead. If you love DMing and want to keep playing you could in-game assign a party leader who would have to help you keep track of player stuff (explain that you're already keeping track of a WORLD) in exchange for maybe, behind-the-scenes story development if you go sandbox later on. A lot of players don't want to do homework but don't mind doing the sheet upkeep together at the beginning of the session. Anyways, good luck.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>First week in HCMC, I was walking around D1, visiting the museums when I saw a guy in his 20s push a grandma into the street while he was trying to brush past her. Tons of room around her on the sidewalk of D1. She almost got hit by a bus but that didn't phase her. She just stared at the guy in a way I cannot describe. That for me was the rudest thing I've ever seen here, after all their talk of how they respect their elders.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Hi! As my username suggests, I live in Vietnam. I've been teaching English to these two individuals for the past year but their language level is very advanced (their doing, not mine) and they're both huge fans of Pok #233;mon so I managed to convinced them to try out Pathfinder 2e. We met up at our regular coffee shop and played 2 hours, which was an absolute blast. We'll be continuing the campaign every Saturday. They are already bringing a notebook and pencil and I've caught them writing new vocabulary as we play along (slice, bludgeon, chandelier, etc) and it's generally been hilarious. I hope you enjoy this r #233;sum #233; of our first session. More to come!</TEXT>

Plus I do bouldering in real life and I find that good technique takes you much farther than strength, so for me it makes sense. As for the damage output, that's fine, the player wanted to RP a defensive character that would protect his allies while they dish out the damage. Now, if the players don't like it, we'll switch back to regular rules, it's not a huge issue.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>The players are okay with it, I'm doing this to facilitate their play-style already. They all grew up watching anime and made up skinny, slender characters that can jump and run up walls, and I don't feel like killing their new love for the game by telling them to change up the stats of their first-ever characters. Follow the expert is neat but a bit too complex and requires a lot of co-designing it seems, which again, I'm trying to keep this game simple for my new players (who I didn't mention, but are playing in their 2nd language as practice, they used to be my private students). The halberdier did invest in dex and trained skills. By changing the rules a bit, the rogue doesn't need it anymore.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Those previous comments all have great points and descriptions and I'm sure you're already sold, as one should be. Here's a slightly different opinion coming from me. First of all, XCOM 2 is the game I have played THE MOST since I've had to balance gaming and adulting. 3 play-through (1 for vanilla and each expansion) and countless Ironman tries, and a few unfinished with Stormtrooper or 40K mods. I've been playing BB for about 3 weeks now, even making playthroughs on my YT channel as a hobby. I love the graphics, it's what got my attention at first. But I gotta say, I'm not too impressed with the game so far. First of all, my company always runs out of money after 20 in-game days and even after reading multiple guides, I completely suck at the economy of this game and it's been a real bummer. Second, I can only play about 1 hour a day and then I feel like it's enough. With Xcom or Civ, I'd sink 4-5 hours in straight on my days off. Third, I feel like it's not thaaaaat deep strategy-wise. Granted I've only scratched the surface. Fourth, so far the missions all seem to be the same and the text is already repetitive. Because I can't progress too far in the game, I'm now on my 10th attempt with low-level characters and it's really sucking the fun out of the game for me.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>At the moment I'm on my 3rd attempt at a Peasant Militia and after a really hard start (losing half my peasants) I decided to keep trudging. I'm now back at 10 men, trying to get the 2000 crowns mission done but it's been 25 days already. I'm just hunting bandits for equipment and sport for now, it's kind of fun, but I don't really read texts or get attached to my brothers as I feel like it's a waste of time :/</TEXT>

    <TEXT>For how tight traffic is in VN (not on that video of course) I see the stupidest accidents all the time. Some of them include people driving head first into parked cars. I don't know if they couldn't gage that the car wasn't moving and also if they thought they'd win playing chicken against a car driver but anyhoo. I'm mostly curious about where could I go watch some falconeering in Vietnam? I've seen a guy drive around on his scooter with his bird of prey on his arm on Bach Dang street, Binh Thanh district, HCMC and that was so metal.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Thanks for the reply! Those groups are in-person, or on Reddit? I read a book I bought in Hanoi, about its history but it was very short and was mostly just a sum-up of all the kings' lives. I'm interested in mythology as well but since I barely read Vietnamese it's been frustrating. Maybe there's French books? I just realized.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Greetings! As the title says, I'm currently looking for Hobgoblin lore. I find their recent history quite interesting and am devouring everything I can find about them on the wiki but it seems like it's just scratching the surface. Is there a book offering more info on Oprak, or the Ironfang Legion, or Hobgoblin history in general? Thanks a lot for your help! PS what do you think of their look in 2e? Personally I find them absolutely horrendous and prefer the art used on the wiki for 1e.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Hello everyone! I usually post my campaign journals in the 2e subreddit but today I wrote something different and I thought I'd share it here instead. For my latest playthrough, instead of writing about the combat encounter that happened (we usually only have 2-3 hours to play and last session was solely combat) I thought I'd write about my session planning process. I tried to be as organic as I could. I live in Ho Chi Minh city (Sai Gon), Vietnam and recently more and more teenagers and young adults have been reaching out on Facebook groups to learn about the game. As they are learning about a new and complex game in a second language, a lot of them are very nervous or intimidated about DM or GMing, so I thought I'd write this to help people who have been thinking about sitting behind the screen but are not sure how to prep. Thanks for reading, I hope it helps someone!</TEXT>

    <TEXT>My wife has expressed the same thing. She feels like saying it in Vietnamese sounds cheesy and has no weight behind it. But she does sound much more animated when she speaks her native language. She's a bit careful about grammar when speaking English so it slows her down a lot.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>My Pathfinder Alchemist blew himself up in his backstory and basically had 3rd-degree burn scars all over his body. No hair, eyebrows, nose, ears or lips. What got him 6 in Charisma though is that I RPed as him talking like that old man in Family Guy and everyone at the table hated him deeply. His name was "Nuts" and he frequently threw bombs where he shouldn't.</TEXT>

The art was supplied by my good friend / first DM / tattoo artist / owner of a pug called Goblin. I hope you enjoy it! I wrote this post to flex my writing muscles, hopefully inspire some players out there, and bring a bit of exposure to the new PF material which I love.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I gotta say, Pokemon has helped me a lot this last month. At 36 years old, I've been struggling a lot with stress for the first time in my life and other games just impact my mood in a negative way. Then a friend lent me his Switch out of the blue and I immediately bought Pok #233;mon Shield and WOW did I need this. I first played Blue, then Ruby, then X but I didn't even finish X. Took a chance with the latest one after watching LilyPichu try it out. I'm now trying to save money to buy my own Switch so I can get the expansions. Real neat game. I haven't traded yet but I'll need help with raids real soon hehe</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I made a big empty world map a few weeks ago and ever since then I've been filling it out, trying to include all the regions I've made for my various abandoned campaigns so far and creating new stuff. At the moment, I'm working on the place names (I'm using [this Wiki](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_generic_forms_in_place_names_in_Ireland_and_the_United_Kingdom) for help) for this particular region. One of my friends from high school with whom I just got back in touch has become a pretty good artist and we're talking of starting (yet another) fantasy webcomic, which is good motivation for me to work on this map. I'm currently exploring Inkarnate Pro and its options. You can see that I don't know how to make convincing fields yet hehehe. If you have any constructive criticism and/or would like to suggest a village/town name, please go ahead!</TEXT>

    <TEXT>A bit more details: It's called the Serpent Coast because of the great beasts that roam the waters of this massive inner sea, which hinder ocean travel but make successful expeditions all the more rewarding. A dwarven empire used to populate the Ganakas Range but a plague extinguished that civilization a few centuries ago. A dwarven monastery (Moralduhr) populated by dwarves of other parts of the world dedicate themselves to exploring the ruins, mapping the ancient underground cities and collecting, honoring the ancient arts found within the mountains. Humans landed on the shores a few decades after the plague and as humans do, have settled the region and started exploiting its resources, despite the protests of the Northern Elven population. Gleamwater river is central to the region and is named so from all the gems and precious rocks that trickle out of the mountain range and make their way downstream. Most settlements subsist on farming and hunting but occasionally a lucky commoner will find an enormous precious gem and if smart, will sell it at one of the two large cities and elevate himself to the rank of nobility. The comic would start in Turtlebrook, a quiet little hamlet.</TEXT>
