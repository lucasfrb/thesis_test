    <TEXT>When riding my first rollercoaster when I was 15. To be honest, I was absolutely scared to ride them for a very long time, always visualizing them as dragons, for some odd reason, then it hit me(not the rollercoaster), if I ride a rollercoaster, I would actually be riding a dragon! So I built up the courage and sat down on the coaster. When it climbed the first steep rail and soared down, I put my arms and started screaming "Give me all of the GODDAMN FUCKIN MONEY IN YOUR FUCKIN BANK, AND IF SOME ONE THINKS OF EVEN PRESSING THE ALARM, ILL BLOW YOUR FUCKIN BRAINS ONTO THR TAUPE WALLS, BITCH!!!" slowly coming to consciousness that l am actually robbing a bank, and resumed my business; I must say, it still was pretty fun though.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Really? The lowest filth? It's just reposts (like most other subreddits) and content for PewDiePie which is the point. Something like r/nomorals or r/shoplifting might be filthier than that surely, (then again, that's why they might have removed those subreddits)</TEXT>

    <TEXT>It all has to do with viscosity my g. Too high, then there's no point in using it as a lube. Too low however, then the surfaces come into contact, which defeats the purpose of using the lube in the first place. Oil seems to strike the perfect balance. Low viscosity but not too low.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Probably one of the best fan arts of PewDiePie I have seen in a long time. It isn't one of those hyper-realistic paintings (wasn't a fan of them, still cool tho), but this oozes charisma. The style is so cool and, best of all, it suits his entire aesthetic pretty well! Great Job OP!</TEXT>

    <TEXT>True, but from what I've seen out and about - people from underprivileged upbringings tend to be more vocal about their concerns, more so than the privileged ones.
