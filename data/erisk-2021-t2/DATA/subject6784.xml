    <TEXT>I don't know about you citizens, but I think that it's the little aspects like this that make a huge difference to surreal games with the level of immersion. I can't get over little things like this - from the gestures and the head movement, every little action defines the thought process and persona of the AI and that is why I love RSI. -Admittedly, it took me a while to separate the actual link for this embedded video from the Star Marine FPS Update page source code, but it was worth it! https://player.vimeo.com/video/127104892/ Thank you Chris, CIG and everyone who is backing this incredible verse - I look forward to seeing you there.</TEXT>

    <TITLE>CS:GO Decent Gaming PC for ~ #163;250?</TITLE>
    <DATE>2015-06-16 12:27:30</DATE>
    <TEXT>Hi all, I'm not that well versed in PC specs, but have been planning on building a PC for a long time. Things and life happen and I really want to get on the gaming scene, but am just strapped for money. So my request is for recommendations on getting a PC that is around  #163;250 (obviously less is better for now), that can run CS:GO at a decent level (not bad graphics and not struggling). All help is appreciated, was originally going for a much higher build but it just keeps getting delayed. Cheers</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I know this has taken time for me to respond but I'm actually a little hurt by this. I designed this from the ground up, no template thank you. Steggo was intentionally two G's. I made a typo? In a concept design? For my own site? (Which I was designing until 5am) I'm devastated. It's not to be professional, it's a blog styled website, to cover antics of the server which all tribe members can contribute to. I don't even bother with buzzfeed or news websites, I don't like them - coincidental only. I'm a web designer by trade and I assure you this is not my first site.

    <TEXT>Hi there, As the other commenter mentioned Bootstrap *should* sort most of this, however you mentioned variant of it? Can you elaborate? I would be happy to take this on, UI and responsiveness is a personal OCD of mine. I'm always nagging my developers about making something look clean and RWD is a must. The only part I might quibble on is the time (although we can talk budget). I personally doubt that one hour would be enough time, as you should know with fixing code, you often solve one problem and create another - plus it depends heavily on the complexity of your app. For example, a one page app for signing up would be an easy 10 mins or so, but a game or even wiki styled app could take hours to nail out the imperfections.

    <TEXT>Queue dodges are probably the most infuriating aspect of any form of competitive play, across all games - edit, removed some words as other redditor pointed out that I got all muddled up :D Doy! Specifically to help deal with this issue and to reduce the chances of it happening - I have a few suggestions: The newly released hero should NOT be allowed for use in ranked play - in casual PvP and PvE I think we can all attest to a stupidly high amount of queue dodges each time a new hero is released. Staying on topic for now, penalties to users should incur more than just a generic time ban. For some people that doesn't matter to them. I believe currency/content bans are actually pretty sound - I wouldn't be able to give you the perfect solution or numbers, but preventing players from using certain heroes or actually deducting currency like reputation can put off players who just abandon a draft cause they don't get their way - or perhaps a loss of progress (XP) on a character. Trolls are gonna keep doing what they do regardless of barriers put in place - so that's just a battle to keep fighting. But I personally believe many queue dodges are due to either long-term players who get mad when someone 'jacks' their main OR new players who just quit since they didn't get the brand new shiny hero (hence suggestions above). I believe other steps should be taken to prevent queue dodges instead of just looking at this as an after problem - penalties are needed but also consider the root problem. Example: I'm a gamer, but I've never played a MOBA, let alone one like paragon which isn't entirely traditional, the basics are the same, but it can be considered different at times. I download and play the (very brief and specific) tutorial, which only shows Gideon pitted in a 1v1 against Steel in a lane (which doesn't match a lane in the map) and the numbers (damage) are out of whack with in game performance. (At least for the start) Now if you've read this far you either really agree with me or your'e entirely against me - that's okay, it's an opinion for a reason. I think that although it may be considered a lot of work, players - especially new ones, should be required to play a hero in a tutorial format, before they are even allowed to touch that hero in PvE, PvP or Ranked. The tutorial should highlight the responsibilities (role), strengths and weaknesses of the hero so that players who do not know can learn WHILE playing. This in turn can prevent queue dodging to some degree as people will not main as one character, but they will also likely stay longer in a match if other players are fulfilling their role choice and understand how to draft better for a team. On a final note - I apologise for the time you've spent getting this far - but I think a level requirement of two kinds should be necessary: A Player Level is requirement one, so that at the very least, someone should have game experience enough to prove worthy of a competitive game (say level 25 for arguments sake). Then a character level requirement (this may be argued as too restrictive in drafting) but where someone needs to have actually clocked some time as a hero to play them in ranked (say level 5 for arguments sake here). Anywho, that's all I have to offer on this subject without going too far into ideas and waffling on, thanks for reading! :)</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Her moves, inarguably are good, that's why people aren't getting the negativity towards her. For me I don't despise her, but she is - out of all heroes - out of place. Truth be told I'm not overly sold on this new hero yet, but I'm waiting it out. Shinbi is a K-Pop Star, not a warrior. Every other hero has a genuine battlefield-esque about them, so ending up on Agora makes sense. Every creature based hero, every humanoid - except Shinbi. If she simply had spirit wolves and none of the singing exactly like a K-Pop Star with a mic and a spotlight, you could watch the hatred disappear. She is not created to fit on a battlefield. She was nothing but a demographic creation. I'm hoping this new hero isn't the same - I got nothing but a Lucio vibe from the teasers.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I know who she is and her lore, I won't take that away from her, but if you had left your shaman tribe in search of fame, then headed to a battlefield, what is more powerful, your mystic Shaman powers or singing on a microphone? What I'm saying here is that the thematics and visuals are made to fit a demographic (and a fairly small one). She is on a battlefield, she is a shaman with spirit wolves - so why the showboating nature of her moves and kit? I could understand emotes, as they are a taunt of sorts - with no combat benefit, but Sevarog doesn't float about with an inflatable hammer, it doesn't fit the theme of Paragon, even with it's wide range of diversified life forms. Shinbi's potential was limited by an audience-grabbing move, that is my issue with her, but of course people who like K-Pop, like the character and are weeaboos are going to do nothing but say she's good. I'm just here giving my opinion like everyone else. Just a final point (as I re-read your message to ensure I wasn't mistaking your points), of course all warriors remove their armour, I'm dead sure Greystone doesn't chill on the sofa with that hefty kit on, but I actually didn't make a single point about her armour...so I don't know why you felt the need to bring it up. But if she then heads back on to a battlefield, logic would suggest she should armour up, perhaps grabbing something closer to a talisman than a microphone :)</TEXT>

This isn't to do with dodging as you corrected, but DC'ing once in a game and I think I merged it due to this topic asking about queue dodging for ranked play as opposed to just queue dodging in general.

    <TEXT>Best advice I can give you is to read this: http://paragon.wikia.com/wiki/Roles_and_Traits Also, the Epic Games Launcher details each hero with a bit more info if you're looking for some specifics - not to mention each hero has a quick tutorial which tends to outline their abilities and situational use. But the Wiki link on roles is probably the best quick explanation. That or I have an article I have written on my blog here: https://weirdlifestrangemind.co.uk/entry/paragon-review</TEXT>

    <TEXT>So, just a little spiel before the main show: I found that while Epic Games are developing an amazing game, the amount of resource for designers to create these kinds of things is very lacking; for example Dekker was such a struggle with no real high quality images available compared to the rest of the heroes. Muriel's wasn't too bad but again, there was certainly a point in Epic's timeline where they upped their visual game for showcase images - and I think the older heroes should get a bit of love. On a final note, every post so far has been met with "Where's this hero", "You forgot X Hero", "This is shit because there's no X". I'm sharing some artwork I've made, you can freely use it and I'm sticking with a five-hero lineup for these 'groups' as more than that is awkward to fit in with ease and have it still look good. Please do not turn my posts into opinionated hero-slinging matches - although DESIGN feedback is greatly appreciated :) But anywho, here's another wallpaper showcasing some support heroes. But sometimes, even support heroes need to talk about their problems, so they formed a support group themselves ;)</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I'm all for people's opinions, my problem with previous attitudes were that people were getting mad *just* because their favourite jungler wasn't there. People got mad about no feng, people started turning it into a competition and asking why I didn't show people like countess in jungle because that's how they run her. While creating the original jungle bunch, I was debating green buff for grux, so I made two versions, but was a little overwhelmed by the number of people who instead of commenting on the artwork, were taking the discussion toward "who my top 5 are".</TEXT>

    <TEXT>So most of you who see my posts know they're mainly around wallpaper creation, but as part of this I ended up messing about with ideas and this simple yet (in my opinion) elegant change to Paragon could allow for a whole other level of love and immersion into Agora. I present, Midnight Agora. We always fight when it's light, midday almost, but imagine the change if the lighting was different? The same UI, towers and Core being light emitting, but where jungle had a little more intimidation and where abilities light up the jungle like random fireworks. I personally think it'd be spectacular! What's your thoughts?</TEXT>

    <TEXT>So this collection is starting as two images, but will expand with time. The concept is that Agora should have a night mode either within a standard game, or as a variant, to give the game a visual change that will keep the game feeling fresh and improve the challenge of areas such as jungle and perhaps deepen the immersion. Picture the scene: Abilities light up lanes like fireworks, you spot Grux dashing towards you through jungle as his axes spark along the floor and Khaimera's eyes light up menacingly in the night. Or, you can keep an eye on this album and see for yourself :D</TEXT>

    <TEXT>My name is Para, I'm a longstanding member of the Vox Animus Discord and I actually joined the group from this very subreddit. I was hesitant as the discord I joined had hundreds of unfamiliar people and I thought I'd get lost in the madness. However you are instantly welcomed and made to feel at home. Vox Animus doesn't just cater to Paragon, there's channels and chats for PUBG, Destiny 2 and more. The admin are always welcoming of new opinions, suggestions and community members who volunteer their help to better the VxA Community. But back to the games. Whether you want to stack up and crush the competition with other like-minded players, join up and try something stupid like all-support games (and win, yes we did that repeatedly) or perhaps just jump online for some silly scrims (1v1 fight in prime pit, ARAM, or whatever), I can honestly say that VxA is the place to be. You don't even have to be gaming, people are always down to talk strats, share memes and better integrate with other members of the community. Why not give it a try? https://discord.gg/CrP7Wpr</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I #8217;m an old player here and I #8217;ve had my moments where I seriously fall out of love with Paragon, but that #8217;s always been during a match where I #8217;ve made a mistake. I played all of Legacy like an idiot, thinking I was doing great, I played early monolith and couldn #8217;t adapt so I dropped it for a while. I came back to mid monolith and did my research, discussed ideas and tackled deck building for my first time. It changed my experience and it was so in depth. I too have moment where I miss the old ways, some features that bring back fun memories, but when v42 was announced - I was so happy! Because it meant change, it meant that I would have to learn something new and that my opponents would need to do the same. Creating a stagnant meta during a beta period for a game is dangerous because that #8217;s when some heroes on the roster never get used (which we #8217;ve experienced). I personally give EPIC all of my support in this endeavour, they #8217;re doing something they haven #8217;t done before, they #8217;re not afraid to tear apart an old system and try something new and I can #8217;t wait for what the future holds! Also, I agree with how the community is, it #8217;s so degrading for the majority - so to all of you who whine and moan, remember this. It #8217;s a free game, you don #8217;t have to play if you don #8217;t want to, play another game and come back when you think that the game is improving if you #8217;re having issues currently. That #8217;s what I did when morigesh was released and I couldn #8217;t outplay her in midlane :)</TEXT>

If you struggle with MA, and aren #8217;t fond of animal turn in, once you hit 25 you start to get Gunpowder barrels included in the voyages, so always keep some in your crows nest and cycle voyages for barrels as they sell well and you get more out of just turning them in for ~150 each (just sold one for ~750)</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Hey Chris, As always, great work on keeping up with a very very active community. Changes definitely feel like we're going in the right direction. To get it out of the way, big points everyone always makes about that I agree with: Amalgam is crazy good, can't tell if that's a good or bad thing. Matchups seem a little wonky (when in last place going against top 3 repeatedly) Personal bugbear of mine was the MMR dampening after two or three days of early access. Usually leaderboard stuff doesn't bother me, but to see people in the 7000 MMR range when a win bags me 30 MMR and 4th place is +1 makes it seemingly impossible to ever see top 200. Now those are out of the way What a blast it can be and boy am I excited for what's to come. See you on the battleground bud</TEXT>

    <TITLE>What Depression is to me [LONG/OPINION]</TITLE>
    <DATE>2020-01-22 02:46:06</DATE>
    <TEXT>***Disclaimer: I #8217;m writing this after just waking up at 10pm after three hours of sleep, before a cup of tea and my toast has gone cold already, so there will be a lot of tangents and discordance in what I write.*** Depression can be experienced differently and uniquely by each person, but overall there are some things that everyone who suffers with it can relate to and understand, no matter what end of the scale you #8217;re on. It seldom comes alone, usually paired with anxiety of some kind, BPD, OCD or something like insomnia.  #8203; I #8217;ll give you an example of how it #8217;s hit me today, I #8217;ve spent the past few days around people I love and care about more than I can put into words here, with a lot of laughter and love - yet I #8217;ve been feeling *off*. Slept okay, eaten well, generally been happy. But I have that sinking feeling, I had all day long to play video games, watch films and essentially do what I please, but I didn #8217;t have any energy, any focus, or any want - I wanted to *want* to do those things. I even tried, but half an hour later and I couldn #8217;t manage it. I felt so drained. For no logical reason, I hadn #8217;t done a workout, I #8217;d managed 6 hours sleep and I was hydrated and had nothing in my mind bothering me. I fell asleep about two hours later at 7pm after going for a walk with music to try and clear my mind and get some fresh air for a second wind to carry me through the evening until bed, but it didn #8217;t really help, I still felt awful. Woke up around 10pm, tried to force myself back to sleep so I wasn #8217;t out of sync, but here I am, writing and adding to this essay at half past midnight. Of all the things that I could be bothered by with depression, mentioned mostly above, what really cripples me about it is the fact that it changes who I am. By this, I mean that usually, I #8217;m quite jovial, I #8217;m sarcastic, witty, laugh about it all kind of person, but when I feel like I do now, it #8217;s hard to crack a joke, or to think of one. It #8217;s tough to laugh at the banterous insults that we usually throw at one another which all mean  #8220;I love you #8221;. The worst part of this change is that people think that you #8217;re mad at them, that they #8217;ve done something and it #8217;s their fault. That because you aren #8217;t all smiles and you #8217;ve put headphones on, in an effort to listen to music and regain some balance, that you #8217;re trying to drown them out or ignore them when you aren #8217;t, when it #8217;s actually because you need music to chill but you don #8217;t want to force them to listen to it because your music tastes differ.  #8203; A lot of the time on social media, there #8217;s posts and memes and that sorta stuff where it #8217;s referenced in either a super serious way, trying to raise awareness, or as many do, use the jokes as a coping mechanism so you don #8217;t cry yourself into a hot mess about your problems. Most of the time when I see these posts and memes, my only interaction is to like it and if it #8217;s a good meme; save it. Seldom do I comment or contribute in any fashion - unless it #8217;s a friend in need. So this suggests that we do in fact share common attributes of depression and I #8217;m sure if you want to get technical, then that #8217;s why it #8217;s becoming more recognised and diagnosable in people. But there #8217;s nothing better when going through some of the horrible experiences and illnesses to know that you aren #8217;t the only one who is dealing with it, or has made it out the other side of it.  #8203; For now I can #8217;t recall exactly who, my mind is telling me it #8217;s Russell Howard, but he makes a point about how  #8220;stress #8221; is simply a rebrand of the word  #8220;unhappy #8221; and he gives examples.  #8220;I #8217;m stressed out about work, the mortgage, the kids and life in general #8221;, would be something you #8217;d say and we all accept that #8217;s the way life is and there #8217;s not much to be done about it, but if you said  #8220;I #8217;m *unhappy* about work, the mortgage, the kids and life in general #8221;, we try to do something about it because we don #8217;t want to be unhappy. Because being stressed has become the norm and being unhappy is okay in part, but not as a continuous feeling. This makes a ton of sense to me, it really spoke to me and connected some of the dots. I was about thirteen when I first started suffering from insomnia and depression, now at the time I didn #8217;t realise that #8217;s what it was really, in my mind, I was just sad about being a fat kid, rarely fitting in (no pun intended) and I would get bored of not falling asleep at night - so I #8217;d play video games and eventually fell for the nonsense that it was the screen keeping me up. To clarify, I am aware about bluelight and trouble games etc cause with sleeplessness so to make it crystal clear, I was struggling to fall asleep with nothing going on, until approx 3-4am when I #8217;d then get bored and get up since school was only a few hours away. There #8217;s a lot more that was happening in my life back then that looking back on it I was able to realise why I felt how I did etc, but I won #8217;t go into that for personal reasons.  #8203; Just a few weeks ago, I attended a mental illness seminar for the benefit of someone else. 99% of what was discussed during the two hour event was stuff me and this other person had already known so it felt kinda useless going, but you go just in case that 1% helps. What **did** help was that the other people attending were exactly that; they were human. People looking for answers and where those leading the seminar couldn #8217;t answer, others in the room chimed in with what worked for them etc. You had realness, people opening up about themselves and loved ones instead of staying silent for fear of being different or embarrassed **AND IT WORKED**. You could feel everyone in the room relax and a few people looked like they wanted to cry because they realised themselves and their loved ones are not alone. After the event came to a close, a woman came straight over to me from another table because I #8217;d spoken up about my insomnia when the topic of  #8216;how to use positive language #8217; or something like that: I #8217;d mentioned how suffering with insomnia and poor sleep patterns,  #8216;jokey #8217; phrases and greetings can quickly become commonplace and stick for a long time, which if you have thick skin and a good sense of humour can be brushed off, but even then it can bring you from bad to worse. So I gave the example that, when you suffer with it, you can often miss daylight and all the usual 9-5 things in life that other people do on a daily basis - even just getting some shopping. Then there #8217;s the fact that you begin to hate yourself. Another day wasted. You #8217;ve still got to mentally prepare yourself for it all tomorrow and make sure you do it because you #8217;re on day three with no food. You have to settle yourself down in an hour in order to make sure you have enough energy to do tomorrow and reset your pattern. You haven't showered yet, if you do, it could wake you up and have you up all night again, but if you don #8217;t it #8217;s something else you have to do tomorrow before going anywhere. It can all stem from just being out of sync for one day. That #8217;s all it takes, one day. Going to bed early, or being unable to sleep at night and you can be stuck in a bad loop for days to weeks and breaking the cycle is tough. If you live with other people, you can #8217;t do something engaging during the night to keep you awake, usually because it rarely comes with zero noise. Or because your parents say you can #8217;t do it and you need to sleep. For me it #8217;s anxiety that I #8217;ll wake someone and I find sleep to be a precious thing, so I don #8217;t want to deprive others of that. By the time that the sun is up and people are shuffling about to go to work and go about their day, you #8217;re totalled, spent and utterly shattered because you #8217;ve done very little but be awake when you want to sleep. For me, energy drinks only do two things, they make me awake for 10 minutes and then hardcore crash, and they make me pee. Same goes for tea and coffee. So before you know it, when it #8217;s 10am and you #8217;re trying super hard to stay awake, you pass out and it #8217;s 5pm and it all starts over again. On some days, managing to get up at a decent time, do some morning hygiene and making it downstairs to see family; that can sometimes take every bit of power you can summon to achieve that and sometimes it #8217;s too much. To then be greeted with  #8220;ah so you #8217;ve decided to join the land of the living #8221; or a similar level of sarcastic comment can completely wipe you out.  #8220;Why did I even bother... #8221; is the first thought I tend to have,  #8220;...I should have just stayed in bed #8221;. So me and this woman got to chatting about what I went through and what I found worked for me or people I knew, and what touched me was that she was concerned for her daughter who was suffering big time and she was trying to find out what she could do to help. I gave her some pointers and spoke about what to avoid doing etc. If that is the **ONLY** thing that changed in the world from that seminar, then that #8217;s a win to me. That mother no longer has to feel alone or useless because she can #8217;t make her daughter #8217;s problem go away, because she doesn #8217;t have the answers or tools to help and that is the most soul destroying thing as a parent, to know your kid is going through hell and you can #8217;t help them. But she has something now, it might not work, but it #8217;s a direction to go in and it #8217;s a light in the dark.  #8203; I think it was Robin Williams who was credited with saying that depression is like being in a room full of people and feeling alone. A man of many faces who gave such joy to us on screen and who as most of you will know, sadly committed suicide a few years ago. This is where I get heavily opinionated and I want to state that I am not going to suggest that the things I go on to mention will work for you, only that they are coping strategies and parts of my personality that have developed to help me deal with my mental load, stress and depression. To open this segment, the most useful thing I learned was the  #8216;spoons #8217; metaphor. This comes in a couple of other variations I #8217;ve heard of, such as  #8216;eggs in the box #8217; and  #8216;mana #8217; for the gamers. Imagine you have a limited number of spoons per day, this number is not fixed and does not stay the same every day. It can change based on how well you slept, if you have eaten well, stayed hydrated, how much you did the day before or a traumatic event etc. Each task in a day, even the tiny ones, will use a certain number of your spoons up, and once you #8217;ve used all the ones available to you, you #8217;ll suffer tomorrow by borrowing spoons to do more. I #8217;ll happily detail an example in comments or do another detailed post if that helps, but I #8217;m aware this post is reaching a ridiculous length. The main lesson to be drawn from it is that you have a limit you can do and that it changes each day and doing more than your limit will force you to borrow from tomorrow. This isn #8217;t a set rule and lots of factors alter your numbers here, so it #8217;s best to try and measure this yourself if you can - if that #8217;s a struggle for you, I #8217;ll help however I can. The lesson taught me that it #8217;s okay to say  #8220;I can #8217;t do anymore today #8221;, which is hard when you #8217;re a perfectionist and you kick yourself for not doing what you expect of yourself and falling short of that standard. It taught me to prioritise things and to praise myself for achieving the smallest of things to others. I managed to shower today, that #8217;s a win. Those dishes got done and I can eat now, that #8217;s a win. It sounds **SUPER** demeaning at first if you #8217;re cynically wired like me, but it works, it takes a little bit of pressure off. Now this is all going to sound very tangential, I was talking about Robin Williams, spoons, where is this going? Please stay with me. He was a man of many faces and the truth is we all are, most of us have three faces, we have a work face, a family and friends face and our own face. This won #8217;t be news to most of you, but for those who do not know this I #8217;ll explain. Our work face is the mask we wear when we deal with everyone else in the outside world who isn #8217;t a friend or family. It #8217;s smiles and nice voice and reserved personality, but it takes a huge drain on your spoons. The family and friends face is a mask we wear when we socialise and spend quality time with those we love, we come out of our shell here, laugh, chill and have a good time sometimes, but we still aren #8217;t transparent. Our own face is our true self, it doesn #8217;t define who we are entirely, but when we take of those other masks, we are tired and can feel alone. That #8217;s the idea most of us stick to and I #8217;m here to controversially say that it doesn #8217;t have to be like that, because when I was in that mindset it became a trap. Admin, I beg of you to read what I have to say here and consider it before deciding on whether this stays or goes. In my own life, not drawing from anyone else, articles, studies or ideology, this is not the way forward. You are not a sad person, you are a **person**, who experiences sadness. You are not a depressed person, you are a **person** suffering with depression. I am not one of these  #8220;you #8217;ll get over it #8221; types. I still suffer heavily with my depression, but I want to reassure you that you have a personality and it is not only comprised of depression. My personality is a sarcastic, cynical, witty, tongue in cheek humour and laughter is the best medicine kind of guy. I spent years of my life using that as my mask. Thinking that I was still just this very sad and depressed person and that #8217;s all I was. I would hold back from saying things I found funny because I was so anxious that people wouldn #8217;t like me, that they #8217;d be offended or find me odd and weird. But that **IS** me, I am weird, I am odd, I am funny (my friends and family will scoff at that), I am all of those things and that #8217;s okay. You #8217;re allowed to be those things. In fact, I wouldn #8217;t want to be anyone else. I spent years trying so damn hard to be likeable and to be normal and fit in. It made me so unhappy and stressed and anxious and I could never be me. Bit by bit in my life I #8217;ve stepped away from it. I #8217;ve done what I wanted to do and say what I wanted to say and put myself and my interests first and it has done wonders for me. I #8217;ve not become selfish and ignorant, because there is a balance. But instead of putting myself last, I #8217;ve put myself not last. And the friends and family I love and who love me, I know that they are under no illusion of who I am and what I go through. I trust them to call me out on things, and I #8217;d do the same for them. It has helped rid me of the anxiety of people saying they care about me and being friends with me when the do not know me. If you can be true to who you are, the things you like and find passion in, you #8217;ll find people who will like and love you for who you are - and those who decide that who you are, is reason to stop being a part of your life, are not people you want to be around. All of the stuff I #8217;ve mentioned above that is controversial and heavily opinionated is not gospel, please do not think that this is the answer or the only way forward. I encourage you to find strength in believing in yourself and trying to accept who you are. I still have my off days too, days I wake up and hate myself for my faults, but I know I have them, they are a part of me I want to change and I try to work on them, and that #8217;s enough to be proud of. YOU are allowed to be you. Keep fighting the good fight.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I'll admit I've not been a very vocal person here but this spoke to me in such a specific way I couldn't not speak. I lost my job I loved about 4 years ago, not due to a pandemic, but I went through a tough personal time and shortly after my girlfriend who was a soul mate for me ended things. I spent a whole year in the gutter, destroyed and I couldn't see the light at the end of the tunnel. Friends, family, work, nothing could help me. A little over a year later I tried work, dating and outlets but it wasn't time yet. Over time things did get easier. I won't lie and say it completely disappeared. You still get days where you get memories, and it'll hurt. But not as much as it does now. I've dated a few people, I've worked a few jobs and I've finally hit a place where I can feel content in my life and not dwell on those hard times. I still hate that it all happened, but I'm able to move forward. It won't seem like it now, but you will too. Deep down you actually know this because you've come here, to hear that other people have been through what you have and that they've made it back to normality. You can do this, but be sure to take your time.</TEXT>

    <DATE>2020-08-27 17:35:28</DATE>
    <TEXT>Sounds weird to say right? How can this be motivational? Well I'll do my best to explain. I've suffered with my mental health and depression for 10 years now. It's had highs and lows, better days and worse months. Just a few weeks ago I had my 23rd birthday. I honestly didn't expect to still be here, not from recent events, but when I was at my worst, I never could have predicted life would be okay for me at this point. It isn't all rainbows and sparkles, far from it, but it's certainly not agonising pain and soul crushing torment anymore. I've had suicidal thoughts over the years and one thing that makes me incredibly happy is knowing I don't have it in me to do it. Even though some days I really wish I could. Be it a lack of ability or emotional responsibility to those in my life, I simply can't act on it. But today something happened that made me realise how consumed I used to be and how I've changed and learned to live. It's nothing major, but today I did a drawing and shaded it in, and if I'm being honest, it looked like ass for the longest time. But it looks okay now, and I'm proud, and it's growing on me. But that isn't even the thing that happened that made me have this realisation. It's the fact that once I was happy with it, I wanted to do another one. I had passion, focus and drive and the will to go through the tough parts again because I took pride in my work and effort. And that's the reason why I'm still here today, because even though we've got some truly awful things to struggle through, we will make it and we'll look back and be so proud of ourselves for what we've accomplished. Be excellent to yourself and each other.</TEXT>

It's hard to put someone else's happiness or dependence on you as a reason to live but from a son to a mother, it's irreplaceable, YOU are irreplaceable. You're special and you'll be the most important thing in the world to your son even if he doesn't know it yet.

    <TEXT>I don't know if it's simply me having had enough of tempo decks being rewarded for running out of steam and clutching a win but I think this card is too strong. Would it fit in the current meta power creep? Yes. Inb4 "it's not strong enough, too slow for XYZ" Not every card gets run in every archetype. Many HS cards never have seen competitive play. Or get phased out. This would be extra juice in aluneth mage, SD mage or mana cyclone/flame walker mage and exodia mage. It's also a fantastic tempo creator with Stargazer Luna. Personally, I can't stand this making it in, but blizzard seems to enjoy making it almost impossible to enjoy actual lengthy matched anymore so 10/10 for matching current design goals.</TEXT>

Determination to be better can be a powerful motivator and it can help you when facing those tougher days.

For sake of balance, I'd say that not only can you choose one but it should auto cast the choice, and that the draw highest cost spell and minion, should be draw a spell and minion, to prevent insane targeted draw for cost reduction.

    <TEXT>A great concept but honestly in today's meta, a five cost spell that retroactively gives a minion +3/+3 is so slow and useless. By turn five any deck that uses this for push should already have board and game almost in hand, not to mention tempo decks would hate to top deck this. My suggestion would be make it a start of game card. But when you cast it from hand, it resummons the minion affected with +3/+3?</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I disagree. Quite a bit. Dormant scrap imp is a 2 cost 3/3 that gives +2/+1 to all minions after being dormant for two whole turns. Grim Rally is a 1 cost spell "destroy a friendly minion, give your other minions +1/+1". I'd say this spell is fine where it is, zero cost spells are dangerous territory.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I myself was in an insanely deep lull in my life for about two to three years. The person I loved more than life itself left me, I lost my job, friends and most of my family swiftly after. It was pretty horrible. Strangely amidst all this madness in the world I've come to find some peace. It's not all gone, it never will be, but learning ways to deal with it better takes such a weight off. First thing I can't stress enough is that once you can come to terms with the fact that having low energy some days is okay, you'll stop beating yourself up so much. I'm a perfectionist and so if I can't do something 100%, I don't do it, because I hate to fail at anything. Comparing yourself to others is not only dangerous, it's unfair. We're all different. My mother who battled through so much mental and physical health saw an improvement in her attitude towards herself when she learned the "spoon" method of dealing with your daily energy. Imagine you have a set number of spoons each day, and that tasks take up X number of spoons. Showering might take up two spoons, washing up takes one, socialising take a few, etc. Your daily spoons depends on how you slept, whether you eat well, and if you used too many spoons the day before (borrowing from today). Once you can gauge how much energy you have each day, it becomes easier to accept that some days you have to let certain things slide for sake of being able to function tomorrow and not let the problem continue. I'd say the biggest step in learning to cope, is when you're able to be okay with who you are and as much as we're hardwired to want others to be into us or take an interest in us, from personal experience and from others, putting our happiness entirely in the hands of others (out of want to feel loved and accepted) is damaging to ourselves and others.

    <TEXT>As someone who's been there, taking those people to hospital and staying with them for the following days, my advice is this: There's going to be a lot of emotion. Anger, shame and self-hatred. They're going to be angry it didn't work. And angry they tried. They're going to be ashamed for falling that low and ashamed that they have to face everyone they know, with them knowing they did it. The most important thing is being there for them. You can offer to talk about it, they will most likely not want to because of all those emotions and thoughts, but offering shows you care and want to understand and help. But if they don't want to, let them know they can talk to you about it anytime, and that you're they're to be with them and that you can talk about anything else if they want to. Some people will just want silence, and some might say they want you to go away. If you're close enough to your cousin, I'd say stay unless they really don't want you around. Say that you want them to know that you care and you want to be there for them so they're not alone. It may seem like they lash out and hate you, but in reality it's their hate for themselves and they'll eventually thank you for being with them.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Okay so that was hard to read if I'm being honest. Please try to split up your sentences for readability. The biggest problem with card design is making it "for this deck" such as your card being "for dragon warlock". Cards are only restricted by class and quantity. Any archetype can use any card, and ignoring that is why so many cards have to be nerfed later on. I think the concept is great, I'm not complaining about the card at all and I read the comments where you mentioned changes, as I mentioned before. My point was that you stated warlock doesn't have early tempo, when it has a lot of it. The whole class identity of warlock is to self damage for added benefit, and cards as old as Flame Imp are perfect examples. If you take a few moments to look up Darkglare Warlock, it has such incredible tempo that I played it and was regularly able to fill the board by turn 3/4 against classic tempo decks such as pirate warrior and murloc paladin. To sum up, great card, but don't say warlock doesn't have early tempo. That's all.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>As someone who lost a soul mate to this kind of thing I related to this in such a deep way. Whilst I don't have PTSD over the death of a loved one, my deepest condolences to you and your family, I can understand some of what you're feeling. The most important thing in this very moment and to remember in the coming days is that you really do need to give him time to think. I made this mistake, I chased and I begged and I didn't give time for my partner to think. It stemmed from not having enough to do to fill my own time, leading to overthinking too much and giving in to the overwhelming pressure. You don't have to go cold turkey and definitely don't ignore him if he contacts you, just try and resist the urge to talk it all out now. While there's no exact science here and you'll need to judge it for yourself, it's important to take this time to think too. What have you both talked about in terms of help, what has he done in attempts to help you or simply cheer you up? Does anything besides the time of year trigger it? Would talking more about your sister's death with your mother be something to try? Can you get counseling and would you try it? When he's had time to think, it's a great show of being able to move forward and that you want to help better yourself too, by the fact you've thought about how to do it. I wish I had a secret formula for how to solve these things, but what I can give you is my experiences and what did and didn't work.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Sending good vibes your way queen! First things first, you're human, and humans are social creatures, we crave affection and that feeling of connection with others. There's a lot of science explaining why we do things that seem wrong to us, like posting nudes and seeking attention from people who aren't interested in us, but bottom line is when we're lonely and depressed, we do things we wouldn't normally do to feel good, however briefly. The most important thing to remember is that doing those things doesn't make you any less of a person! I'm the opposite end of the scale physically, I'm an obese guy, with stretch marks like I'm pregnant, and more stretch marks on my arms and armpits. It isn't pretty. I hate my body, but it's the body I have and to some people it's attractive. Yours will be too I'd recommend trying to make friends in online forums for things you enjoy or are passionate about, even if you don't know much, because common interests are the easiest way to make friends. It'll give you something to do and focus on, it might make you happy, but you'll also get to talk with people and get that much needed feeling of connection!</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Not to worry, you speak better English than most and I'd rather be critical so you can better yourself, not meant in any bad way. I wish more classes has better dragons and more of them so I'm all for dragon warlock getting some more cards. Especially one like this. No Darkglare is the name of a warlock minion, where taking damage refreshes two mana crystals. With the newer cards, it allowed for fast board control, big power swings , burst and healing thanks to soul crystals. It does run some discard for added tempo Here is the deck code for the version I am using currently: ### Darkglare # Class: Warlock # Format: Standard # Year of the Phoenix # # 2x (0) Raise Dead # 2x (1) Flame Imp # 2x (1) Soulfire # 2x (1) Spirit Jailer # 2x (1) Tour Guide # 2x (1) Voidwalker # 2x (2) Expired Merchant # 2x (2) Soul Shear # 2x (3) Darkglare # 1x (3) Shadowlight Scholar # 2x (4) Brittlebone Destroyer # 2x (4) Diseased Vulture # 2x (4) Nightshade Matron # 1x (4) Shadowflame # 2x (6) Hand of Gul'dan # 2x (8) Flesh Giant # AAECAcn1AgKTAf/OAw4wzgfCCP2kA4GlA7W5A7a5A8u5A5vNA9bOA9fOA8HRA8zSA83SAwA= #</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I did exactly that in my relationship. She wanted time to think and my brain went into panic mode - "Time to think is code for I don't want to be with you anymore and we should break up". Sitcoms and movies drill this into us and it's a bad idea to follow suit and pressure the other person. Often it will push them further from you and force them to decide and that damage is not repairable sometimes. Breathing time is so important, you might see it as "he's going to see how peaceful it is without me and leave me", but if he loves you and gets a chance to recoup and he also sees you trying to make forward progress, then there's no reason why he wouldn't come back. And don't forget it isn't about bettering yourself for him, if that's your motivation to do it then that's fine, but ultimately do it for yourself, because that's what he will want, he wants you to be better for you.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Depression is a consumer. It's linked to memory loss and it can eat up a lot of other things along the way. But I'm one of those people who kept getting told "it gets better". When you're convince life is over and you've FUBAR, "it gets better" not only feels worthless, it's infuriating. It doesn't get better, it gets easier. I've suffered with mental health for 10 years now, since my early teens. A few years ago I had a soul destroying time when my soul mate left me, I lost my job and lost touch with my friends and family. I was in such a deep pit that I honestly was ready to die. Time. As stupid as it sounds, especially right now, time is a great healer, it isn't just a cliche. But you need to give it some help. If you're suffering from a particular problem, identifying what causes it is very important because you can begin to understand it and potentially prevent it from happening or find ways to help you manage it. Hobbies, passions and work/focus will help because whilst you are busy doing things, you don't have time to overthink or space out, which makes it easier to sleep as well. I have been severely anti medicine from personal experience in my younger years but I had a two month course of sertraline this year and it did wonders for my mental health. But by far, with no exaggeration, the best thing to help yourself, is acceptance. It's hard to tell you what you need in order to achieve it, but it's learning to accept your flaws and to not let them define you. So as you say about your sadness, accept when you are sad and that you have been sad, but you are not a sad person. Learn to accept you are not perfect, but it doesn't mean you aren't still a great person.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Alright I feel like it's big brother time, and with me being a big brother you get two things, truth and truth. Let's do this So I'd say you have every right to be who you feel you are. Despite what most parents seem to think, nobody knows you better than you know yourself. There's also a difference between normal and right, so I'd say you do have a normal life and a normal relationship with your parents, in the way that yours is similar to a lot of other people, but I don't think it's right. Your parents will probably say stuff like "You're just a kid, you don't know what you're talking about" or "My house, my rules" and stuff like that. To me, you should have your own voice, you should have a right to be who you want to be. BUT, and this is where the reality part of it sucks, if your parents are that closed minded, there's not much you can say or do to change their minds. Part of growing up and living at home is doing chores and "getting off your ass and contributing". I know it feels like punishment and harassing you, but that side of things is just natural at your age. It's gonna sound like I don't understand you, but trust me, when you have to leave home and work all day and pay bills you'll wish you were back at home, even if it feels crap right now. That's not to invalidate how you feel, I'm glad you've vented to us about it and I really feel for you</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I really feel for you here. Firstly, you're not pathetic or a total joke, you're a goddamn human being who has been through some serious shit and has come out the other side of it alive. You dropped your crown KING! Interests in a relationship is a tough subject even when nobody is dealing with mental health. Not to mention with COVID forcing a lot of people to spend even more time with each other, even the closest of partners can get on each others nerves. Hopefully without causing any offence I'd suggest your wife may have some mental health issues of her own and perhaps she isn't sharing them with you, causing the unnecessary lashing out and the logical disconnect between what she chooses to watch and why you don't accompany her. I could never stand the over the top romcoms my gf used to watch and she wasn't really into my stuff either and so we used to compromise by agreeing to watch each others shows together one at a time. Might be an idea? Another suggestion I have and I'm aware COVID won't be helping here, is to perhaps find other people to share in your hobbies with? From what friends, family and my own experience has taught me is that trying to do too much with a partner can be more damaging than helpful. Healthy relationships enjoy some time apart. I hope this comes across as ideas and opinions rather than someone trying to tell someone in a 10 year marriage how to suck eggs.</TEXT>

Speaking only from my experience, where work has been tough to find and keep, where I'm now in a hostel for my second year (second time here since leaving home), sometimes things like doing chores seem trivial compared to debts and affording food.

It's not designed to be a top tier pick for most decks, but off-brand stuff like spiteful, phaoris, highlander, anti-combo and just plain RNG drop from discover and "add random" would make it an interesting card.

Whilst you may look at this and think "it has to stick for a turn so it's not broken" I invite you to think about cards like play dead, nine lives and many other deathrattle triggers available to hunter. This card can very easily be abused into an insane OTK. I'd recommend lowering the stats of the initial minion and upping the stats of the resultant beast, but do not give that thing charge.</TEXT>

If it were a weapon you could have it so it works like rune spear, so when you attack you discover a perfect card and lose a fixed number of crystals. Could call it Hand of Zephyrs</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I grant that there are other combos, and I am seriously done with people designing "standard only" cards, this whole "Wild can handle it, deal with it" attitude is why cards end up getting nerfed or changed. Nine lives doesn't require you to get to 8, if you'd read the cost reduction I mentioned. You can't copy spells, you're right, but spell generation is a thing. I think honestly, the only design flaw in your card is the initial minion being a beast type and the resultant minion having charge. There's no sense in your enemy attacking into this on their turn, so they'll avoid it, leaving it open for wombo combos. Or waiting until OTK status.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I'd just like to point out that because other broken or faster OTKs exist isn't an excuse to design a card you like and have bias for, and then call it fair and balanced. Be critical of your own design, think about how it can be manipulated and most importantly how it would be to come against it. Your opponent drops this on 8, after having dominated the board and crushing your health, does it feel like a balanced minion then? You remove it and have another 7/7, or you silence it and...have a 7/7. Felcracked colossus is essentially the same card, but it has no tribe synergy, only spawns a taunt of same stats and does not gain charge. It costs 10 mana. So by definition, your card is much stronger.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>If we're doing counter arguments, Coilfang has rush and forceably spawns a defensive statted taunt, so it's on the same power level - stipulated. But it has no tribe and no charge. As for the 8/8 dragon, I'm assuming the one that drops a 7 cost minion? Plagued protodrake. 7 pots have gotten better over time but still can whiff. Also no charge or taunt. Cost reduction and tribe synergy yes, but nothing that can be comboed into an OTK. There's nothing wrong with an OTK, and I like the flavour of this one, I want to point out that I love the card, I just don't see it existing in the format you've put it in.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I'm all for spirited debate, whilst I've been around since the early days I'll hardly claim to be all knowing. I think that you having played it a lot this season gives you a lot of experience with it and that will probably make your opinion more valuable than mine. But I think a common failure we all make is "this expansion", it's impossible to make every archetype of every class viable or strong without either destroying the flavour of the expansion or introducing insane bias. I'm not saying totem shaman is a problem deck, running rampant in either meta, but the reason we have power creep making so many cards obsolete is because new cards get added to bring a type of deck back up into meta.</TEXT>

I can't help but want more people to talk to. About almost anything, I'm quite happy to talk to people for the interaction itself, if the topic is interesting then bonus! I'm not sure where to start, or how to go about it, I just want to talk to people.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I'm quite tired so bear with me here. Casual and unranked share MMR and ranked has its own. Easy enough, stupid in my opinion but easy. People who play ranked often will rarely dip into casual. So let's say you're plat 3+, you play ranked often and practice a bit. Your Casual MMR will be low, matchmaking you against say Silvers and Golds, but your visible Ranked MMR is Plat. This is where the 'mismatch' happens. Arguably casual should have zero MMR and you get what you get and unranked should be a copy of ranked MMR without adjustment. Technically there's nothing 'wrong' with matchmaking, because it works as ubisoft intends for it to work, but it is 100% stupid.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Alright so in a short sentence. I agree. To clarify, I spent a lot of time earning my frames, grinding my levels, and got my own saryn because a) I love her and b) so I could pay my buddy back for helping me forma my builds by levelling him back. My collection is lovely now and I know most of my frames well and they are built with a specific task in mind. But some frames that I'm not interested in have been MR fodder, just like weapons. I'll always play about with the concept, but why suffer to level them instead of taking a quick trip to hydron to get the abilities maxed so you can get a better feel for what you're working with? Working hard isn't always better than working smart.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>So when you get a new frame, one you've not used before, what's the first thing you do? Like if you want to take your time levelling your frames fair enough, you do you, but that doesn't mean I can't learn my frame well by getting it from level 0-30 and starting my formas by going hydron. Personally I think it's the mentality of the player and their ability to grasp the concept and synergies. I've met people who have played much longer than I have who ended up learning from my builds. But I had a guide to show me the ropes. You do get a lot of newbies looking for handouts and carries.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I completely agree with rsavaris here and I'll do my best to explain my reasoning. After playing long enough, you get accustomed to meta, what minions are often run and by the early turns you can usually predict what your opponents deck consists of. Which means you should generally have an idea about what minion you'd be looking to use that soul shear on. Let's take aggro/discard warlock and your use of soul shear, if they throw down kenrethad and two flame imps for early aggro, holding that soul shear back for a three health minion is foolish. You'll die. Weigh up the situation every time. Have you seen the problematic card come down yet? is this their final push or are you going to use your last bit of removal and get pushed more? Will those soul fragments enable other minions that will help you recover? Let's say you have a Chaos Nova in hand and feel confident you can heal/delay enough to last until then. Save the shear for a key minion, or to bring a higher health minion into line with the 4 damage aoe. A minions attack should also be considered in decision making as your health points are finite. if your opponent has something such as a 4/2 and you choose not to remove it, you sacrifice 4hp (or a high value trade) because you want to get the most out of it. TL;DR - there's no textbook answer, judge the threat of the target, the resource of your hand, the resource your opponent may be holding back and make an educated decision based on the information available. Sometimes it's right, sometimes it isn't. Just be sure to learn from the both.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Honestly I could give so many more examples and scenarios, I was thinking up a few after responding actually. And don't let inexperience shun you from asking, learning is a huge part of the curve with this game, and one of the primary purposes of a subreddit for a game should be a place where players can reach out for information. I still vividly remember the day I learned how complex some interactions can be (and how it's grown since) such as when I first learned that making a minion that deal damage as an effect, poisonous, will kill any minions affected by that spell. Mind-blowing at the time. If you need more advice, or have questions, please ask. Keenness to learn and understand is a great thing to have.</TEXT>
