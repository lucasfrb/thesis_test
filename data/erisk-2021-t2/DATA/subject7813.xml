I believe it's a mix of novelty being my favorite genre of music and the teal rex at the restaurantosaurus lounge (great non alcoholic beverage) also it's a short walk away from finding Nemo, expedition Everest, dinosaur, primeval whirl, and it's tough to be a bug.</TEXT>

    <TITLE>I have a suggestions based around skins</TITLE>
    <DATE>2020-03-23 01:01:14</DATE>
    <TEXT>Skins are one of the most interesting parts about this game and one of my personal favorite parts. So why might I ask are so many of the best ones "exclusive" or "limited". For example if I go to a hero like Ganesha or Thor half of the skins for both heros (especially the best looking ones) are completely impossible to get because they are exclusive. My suggestion is to get rid of this and substitute it for events that happen annually say a Saint Patrick's day one or a Halloween one where you can buy the previously exclusive ones. Joke skins can be for April fool's, chibi valentines, and plush on Christmas along with Christmas skins. Say a skin doesn't conform to a certain holiday or date make them available always for your average skin price and if they were part of a chest them make them much more expensive than your average skin. Some skins can stay as exclusives like convention or commemoration skins but limited edition should not be a thing. Thank you for reading, Signed u/subject7813</TEXT>
