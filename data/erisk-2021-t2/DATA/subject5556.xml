    <TEXT>Oh I do hope so and I hope it goes something like this. The world starts where Republic city is already destroyed by the spirits who came into the world. The next avatar tries to solve this issue by finding a happy medium but both sides simply cannot co-exist and a particular spirit tries to destroy all the humans once and for all. The avatar tries to fight the spirit but is unable to win the first time even with the avatar state. The current avatar asks Korra how he/she can stop the spirit but Korra isn #8217;t able to help much since the only spirit she ever stopped is Vaatu with the help of Raava. Korra then tells the current avatar that there were many avatars before her and those past avatars have faced many spirits but sadly that knowledge is lost when she ended the avatar cycle and with that, the avatar state also isn #8217;t as powerful as it once was. The current avatar does not believe its forever gone since no avatar in history have ever destroyed the avatar cycle so who is to say it is lost forever. The current avatar then went to the place where the harmonic convergence battle happened and was able to reconnect with Wan, Wan tells him that the cycle is simply dormant and that the current avatar should go and find each avatar #8217;s most important place, thing, or person to reconnect with them spiritually. So then the series will be about the avatar going to different places around the world to reconnect with his/her past lives such as going to Koh #8217;s lair for Kuruk (because Koh kidnapped his love), Kyoshi island for Kyoshi, the Fire temple for Roku etc. Before the finale, the avatar is able to reconnect with each and every one of his past lives except Aang. The evil spirit confronts the current avatar and is fighting in a global scale where they visit many places like the North Pole, Ba Sing Se, Hei Bai #8217;s forest etc. The avatar eventually gets smacked down at the location where Aang fought Firelord Ozai and it was at that moment, the current avatar is able to reconnect with Aang finally. At this point, the avatar enters the avatar state which is at full power and defeat the spirit. The avatar on his journey learns that sometimes there isn #8217;t a happy medium where everyone can agree on and believes the best way for humans and spirits to co-exist is to have the spirits return to the spirit world. The spirits returns to the spirit realm once more and are separated from the humans again.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Also I would think the Fire Nation wouldn #8217;t take too kindly of Iroh #8217;s rule at this point if he #8217;s the one who defeats Firelord Ozai. The water tribes and earth kingdom hates the fire nation but the fire nation doesn #8217;t hate themselves. They think Ozai is bringing them to a new age and prosperity so if Iroh defeats Ozai and assumes rulership of the nation and immediately cease any warfare with the other countries, there would likely be riots and attempted assassinations against him because the citizens will view Iroh as the villain who stopped their reign. If it #8217;s the avatar who stopped Ozai though, the world knows the avatar represent something greater altogether like as if the avatar is a force of nature. Also going back to the assassination point, though there are attempts to assassinate the avatars in the past, most people would probably think otherwise about it since the avatar is this almighty figure who is the only person who is capable of controlling all four elements. Iroh is only a legendary General at most to the world.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Fan outrage is a powerful thing so you never know. I mean I #8217;m not going to disagree with you, the chances of the avatar cycle (restoring the cycle), closing the portal (creating mystery of spirit realm again) and destruction of republic city (going back to the lifestyle and culture of each nation) getting retconned at once but for one of these, it #8217;s probably likely especially when everyone hated how Korra destroyed the avatar cycle.</TEXT>

Yeah I heard it #8217;s more of Nick #8217;s fault but was it really that hard to recycle a villain? Amon could have just survived the explosion in the end with some water bending shenanigans, the return of the dark avatar by the birth of the next dark avatar or Zaheer escapes again (honestly, Book 3 was the best)) and I don #8217;t think Aang #8217;s story can be another great saga again so why not watch another Avatar try to save the world?</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Well it seems speaking g to each avatar takes time and effort. Wan is 10,000 years back so I don #8217;t think that Aang thought it was a great idea to contact himself that far back especially when Aang considers Roku to be the wisest. Aang probably thought if Roku doesn #8217;t know, none of the other avatars would know. I think the same probably applied in Roku #8217;s lifetime when he contacted Kyoshi, I can imagine Roku thinking Kyoshi being really wise. There #8217;s also the implication of knowing to contact Wan for the answer, it #8217;s not like Aang knew that Wan have seen a lion turtle in his lifetime. Aang would literally need to ask each and every avatar that came before him (10,000 years is a lot of avatars) just to hit the jackpot of one avatar seeing the lion turtle. Also Aang needs to meditate, focus and summon the avatar from his previous life or is at a location where there is a significant impact with the corresponding avatar. Not once in the animated series do an avatar just pop in and say,  #8220;hey Aang, welcome to the spirit world, my name is avatar Wan #8221; or another avatar butting in the conversation. Imagine if Roku and Aang was having the conversation and Wan be like,  #8220; you know, I #8217;ve seen a lion turtle before so why don #8217;t you ask me? #8221;.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Oh, indeed such great writing when one of the major lore that shaped the avatar world is destroyed forever. What stake as well? Book 2 is universally agreed to be the most poor of all books and it had this  #8220;good writing #8221; you speak of. I #8217;m upset that a major piece of lore that makes avatar so unique and different from every other show is gone forever. If you want this  #8220;good writing #8221; which is still terrible writing over the identity of avatar then I can #8217;t help you. At this point, I #8217;m just watching a show that has the name of avatar, and has things related to avatar like bending but it #8217;s not avatar because avatar was about a person who was more special than any other person because he can contact his past lives to receive guidance and you can see that this person #8217;s past lives made impacts to the citizens in the world like Kyoshi day for Kyoshi Island and Chin Village are severely different. Now that all the avatars are gone and the show doesn #8217;t travel the world anymore to sightsee places where past avatars #8217; left their mark, I can literally watch any anime with magic and I would get the  #8220;good writing #8221; experience you speak of. I think you are unable to grasp the concept of world building because this step made Avatar completely unoriginal now that the main character is just an overpowered main character like any other show. You want to know great writing? Go watch Made in Abyss and that #8217;s how you do great writing (by building on the established lore not destroying it). How come ATLAB is 10x better than anything TLOK can ever offer without destroying the lore? How come the  #8220;good writing #8221; of Korra can #8217;t put TLOK on top? Also one of the greater aspects of the show (IMO) is watching the avatar talk to their previous lives. It #8217;s so interesting to see how the same person with different lives to have such different personalities, ideals and morals and how they would conflict with other avatars even though they are all one and the same person like Aang would not ever want to kill a person but Kyoshi is telling him that she would not hesitate or even Yangchen disagreeing with Aang even though they are both brought up by the monks and are taught all life are sacred. But with your  #8220;good writing #8221;, now we can just see Korra go mope in a corner and write love letters to Asami because I #8217;m sure that #8217;s more interesting and this show #8217;s  #8220;good writing #8221; totally made us well aware of the feelings they had for each other right until the book 4 #8217;s finale. The destruction of the avatar cycle is a cop-out way to try to create stakes and in doing so, they were able to please you who can #8217;t see the bigger picture of how important the cycle is to the cartoon. Your little climatic moment completely blind you on any future potential the avatar may have. Now we won #8217;t have anymore moments of when previous avatar taking control of the body to do badass things like Roku fighting the sages and Zhao or Kyoshi announcing to she did kill Chin just because you want your moment of 2 Kaiju avatar fighting it out that wasn #8217;t even satisfying at all.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Yea I might have exaggerated that everyone agrees on it but while I can deal with loss, I think losing the avatar state was too much (coupled with the mystery of the spirit realm in one go). Watching avatar as a child had 3 things that really made me love the show, the culture and lifestyle behind each and every nations, the mystery and magic of the spirits and the spirit realm (man I love the episodes of Wan Shi Tong #8217;s library, Hei Bai, Koh #8217;s laities etc and I still love it even as I rewatch it right now) and the avatar cycle (the best moments of avatar imo are the episodes of his appearing either as spirits telling Aang of their lives and how they conflict with the morals and ideals of Aang #8217;s or how each avatar left their impact like Kyoshi day from Chin village and Kyoshi island are held on same day but have completely different meanings) These three things made the show unique, it gave the show an identity that no other show could replicate. The introduction of republic city got rid of the unique cultures of each nation which is a sad loss but such is life but the loss of the avatar cycle is like taking away the avatar #8217;s identity. It #8217;s like playing Link from the Legend of Zelda without his green tunic (that #8217;s wrong and the creators knows that so that #8217;s why his green tunic is end-game armour to make it even more special). I was already upset that they took that identity away but then they quickly throw another curveball and took away the magic of the spirit realm as well.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>But the avatar state is literally just a power-up button now, like Naruto in Demon Fox mode, Goku in Super Saiyan. It used to carry heavy significance such as the time when the avatar enters the avatar state, it #8217;s all the past lives active at once. You also won #8217;t see avatar states that have the current avatar turn into the old one anymore, Roku demanding Jong Jong to teach him fire Bending? Gone, Roku takes control and fights off the fire sages and Zhao? Gone, Kyoshi takes control and announce he did kill Chin? Gone. The show also lost the the stake of trying to keep the avatar state safe as well now because the past avatars are gone and the show won #8217;t kill the avatar because if there is no avatar, there is no show (unless if they one day make the series true finale) so now there is nothing to really worry about for the audience when the avatar goes in the avatar state. The only thing stopping them are the main character #8217;s inner turmoil. Spirit realm used to be that world where only the dead and the avatar could go into, it was a place special to the avatar. Now it is free estate for anyone, it lost its impact.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>It #8217;s proven even If you are the most skilled bender, you can still be bested as with the case of Azula killing Aang and the cartoon already had 2 things to stop it being OP from the start, the inability to control the avatar state and the risk of losing the cycle but now that that risk is gone, the audience don #8217;t need to worry about Korra messing things up in avatar state because there is nothing to protect, she can just press the avatar state button and proceed to win. You can only make Korra appear so many times in the next avatar series, I think i read somewhere that Aang didn #8217;t show up much at all because the creators didn #8217;t want him stealing Korra #8217;s thunder. If the same logic applies, why would we get to see much of Korra. You can only learn so much of Raava. Fought in a war with Vaatu for millions eons and battle for dominance on the day of Harmonic Convergence. There is nothing new to learn about Raava and we don #8217;t know can the next avatar even talk to Raava. Wan can but as far as we know, no other avatar could until Korra had Raava ripped out. So yes, those moments are gone forever because Raava can #8217;t go to Jeong Jeong and demand him to teach the avatar the 4 elements for the avatar has done it 1000 times in a thousand lifetimes. Ok, I forgot there are people that can crossover but that don #8217;t stop the spirit realm being mystical before and now it #8217;s free estate. It used to be rare for anyone to go there but now? Free estate. I don #8217;t think people are reincarnated, I don #8217;t remember anyone who can reincarnate other than the Avatar. While in the spirit world, past lives of avatars seem to exist there but maybe only the dead avatars exist there.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>You have completely twisted what I say just to fit your narrative at this point. I said they should not have destroyed the cycle because it takes away the unique quality of Avatar and destroys the massive lore the cycle has built. I #8217;ve also added the fact that destroying the cycle made the show worst because it took away and will take more away from any Korra sequels or any new avatars having interactions with any avatar barred Korra. This also means we won #8217;t likely get to learn about any of the previous avatar lives that are not introduced yet (like who is the 2nd avatar and how did he interact with Wan, what is Avatar #8217;s Jaffar #8217;s life, who is that old man before Jaffar). You were the one who said it #8217;s better that the avatar does not have past avatar lives and I gave counterpoints on why it is a terrible idea which is the lack of danger going into the avatar state because now the avatar has plot armour when it comes to being killed in the avatar state (unless the series come to an end) which in turn, took away the audiences #8217; anxiety of the avatar entering the avatar state so it makes for a less enjoyable experience (I bet no one in their right mind thought,  #8220;oh shit, is Korra going to get killed by Kuvira while she #8217;s in avatar state? #8221;), but now you are using the counterpoints I #8217;ve provided as if I #8217;ve been building my whole basis solely on that counterpoint.</TEXT>

In fact, it gives the avatar identity again, allow them to play with past lives interaction/guidance, and once again, the avatar state will feel like it #8217;s something that is worth considering the pros and cons because as of right now, the avatar state is so full of pros and not much cons.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>This  #8220;reset #8221; means there won #8217;t be anymore lore regarding old avatars, I for one would like to know what the 2nd avatar or even the 3rd avatar is like. The 2nd one must #8217;ve been really confused on who or what he is because no one even knows what #8217;s an avatar at that time, why can this one guy bend all 4 techniques like this one other dude long time ago and why does he keep saying he can talk to this ghost? People will likely think the 2nd avatar is a whack job. The 3rd avatar will probably be someone who tries to live up to his predecessor #8217;s lives at that point if the avatar isn #8217;t established to the citizens at that point. Oh wait! This is what could #8217;ve been but now that Korra destroyed that, all we get to learn about now is more Korra and future avatars only. Having 4 people to talk to is 4 more than Korra can talk to. You say it like it isn #8217;t a big deal but if the ATLAB didn #8217;t have Roku, the show wouldn #8217;t be the same. Who is going to provide those flashbacks? Can #8217;t be the avatar because that link is severed unless we are dying to know more about Korra. The citizens? That #8217;s impossible as well because they don #8217;t live as long as Kyoshi. I #8217;m placing importance because it #8217;s the avatar #8217;s identity as I #8217;ve said many times, now the avatar and the avatar state is nothing more than a  #8220;press to win #8221; button for Korra. It used to be a cool power-up that packs a lot of information of the avatar world behind it and is what makes the avatar feels so different from the countless amount of mainstream animes out there but now the avatar state is as original as Naruto #8217;s ninetail Fox transformation (an entity trapped inside a person oh whoop de doo like no anime has done that before (and before you say it, I know avatar isn #8217;t an anime but it #8217;s structure and plots are more like shonen animes instead of western cartoons) instead of an ability that taps into the power and knowledge of countless lives that this person experienced in his previous life that is only made possibly because of an immortal spirit permanently bonding with the host which allowed her to capture memories of all the lives as a by-product of the immortality. But you are essentially on the side of why it is better for Korra to not have her past lives by presenting the  #8220;upsides #8221;. Then you are arguing why it #8217;s better. We always knew the avatar can be struck down much like how Azula killed Aang and almost destroyed the link. It hasn #8217;t crossed that boundary so the impending danger was always there. Now it crossed that line, the pressure is gone. She is full plot-armour proof now. My point makes complete sense since it detracts the audience #8217;s experience of the show but you want to insist on,  #8220;ahh, U mad cuz she can #8217;t be killed twice!? #8221; Because that supports your narrative the most. Now what does being crippled or someone else getting hurt got anything to do with the avatar cycle. You did use that and now you say you didn #8217;t, your post did exactly that and now you are lying through your teeth.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I still haven #8217;t seen anything like Avatar where the main source of the power comes from previous lives. There are animes where D #233;j #224; Vu is the main focus (Re:Zero) or maybe at most, one generation of previous life carrying over to the new life (just about every isekai anime with a copy ability) but nothing like Avatar where it is one of the main focus.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I repeat because it #8217;s quite clear you aren #8217;t taking it in, you think I like repeating myself but when all you were able to get from all my points was that I #8217;m mad because the avatar can #8217;t be killed twice, one really needs to repeat oneself just so it is crystal clear. People don #8217;t realise what they want until it is thrown at them, no one knew they wanted Wan but look at Wan, people loved him and Raava and from the sounds of it, you like Raava a lot as well. Before Korra introduced Wan and Raava though, no one batted an eyelid about the idea of the first avatar. No one knew they wanted kyoshi until Kyoshi became a badass and now look at it, Kyoshi is getting a second book on the way. The great thing about knowing the previous avatars life over new ones are that you can learn their feats in a matter of few episodes and how it can match up with the ATLAB and TLOK to give a much more rich experience. Few examples are: - The origins of Bending came from lion turtles much like how Aang obtained Spirit Bending and not people magically born with Bending one day. - Why Koh hates the avatar (because Kuruk tries to kill him every year and is still trying to do so when he #8217;s dead) - Dai Lis were elite warriors formed by Kyoshi which made it super ironic that this group that was made by the avatar was is now after the avatar. - Jianzhu someone from The Rise of Kyoshi is a Gan Jin earthbender instead of just a nobody (now when you rewatch that episode of the episode of Zhang vs Gan Jin, you are more likely to help one side over the other) Playing with sequels though, it #8217;s where retcons and plot tends to happen like what happened to the avatar #8217;s opposite element being the hardest to learn? When did it turn to personality? When did the avatar turn from the manifestation of the planet to a spirit bonding with a human? Also I don #8217;t think there is a moment in anything that happened in TLOK that made me think,  #8220;oh, so that #8217;s why this thing is this way at ATLAB #8221; other than Wan #8217;s flashback which is what I #8217;ve been saying, prequels or past avatar experience enriches the experience when you rewatch the 2 series. Yes, shit happens but just because it isn #8217;t a mistake to you, it doesn #8217;t mean it #8217;s not a mistake to a lot of people. I can say the last airbender movie is just shit happened but it #8217;s not a mistake ( but it is a terrible mistake and should be wiped from history). I would explain to you how chill I am but this is the internet, such is life.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Because we #8217;ve seen an avatar that can talk to past lives (Aang) and one that can #8217;t (Korra) and I can tell you, the one that can is 100x better than Korra but guess what? The times the avatar that can #8217;t talk to her past lives once upon a time could and they were some of the best moments in book 1 and 2. So maybe that #8217;s why I know what I want lol. Well there is a lot of definition of mistake, I for one see a mistake when something is changed to the point it #8217;s not even a resemblance of it #8217;s former self. Take spongebob for example, first 3 season was a family cartoon, anyone and everyone can watch it and it #8217;ll be entertainment but then the later seasons went towards kids only with terrible jokes and scenarios etc. yea sure, they got more audience because of this change but the quality dipped immensely and reviews for the episodes aren #8217;t good anymore but guess what? They are earning more money and getting higher viewership. Another example can be lootboxes in gaming, the companies that implement lootboxes are making so much more money than ever but at the quality of the game being poorly polished so it will force people to buy them. The company successfully met their expectations but everyone can say lootboxes are a mistake no matter how you look at it. So here I am saying Avatar will be a former shell of itself, Korra had her mopey moments in Korra of not contacting the Avatars in Book 3 and 4 but it #8217;s time to go back because quality of avatar will dip when there are no past lives shenanigans because that #8217;s one extra idea (that can be spread into further ideas) the show can play with when making more episodes. If you don #8217;t get what I #8217;m saying, here is a very basic explanation. When the writers make an episode, they decide on what the episode about, without the avatar past life, they can: 1. Follow main story (defeat Ozai) 2. Focus on relationships (Toph and Katara bonding) 3. Focus on side characters (Iroh #8217;s voice actor death) 4. Side plot shenanigans (Paint lady episode) 5. Side character Flashback (Zuko #8217;s flashback) 6. Lore building (Kyoshi island and Chin village) But if the writer writer can add avatar past lives in: 7. Flashbacks (Wan #8217;s origin) 8. Character development (Aang on Spirit Lion Turtle ep or how Aang needed to visit Fire temple in Book 1 to speak to Roku) 9. Spiritual Journey (Hei Bai #8217;s episodes) Its just more options for the writer to change up the pace but take that away, you now have less options and no matter how you spin it, that #8217;s not good. For point 6, do you think the chin Village episode would have such a big impact if Kyoshi didn #8217;t appear? I would 100% place my money on no one ever saying,  #8220;man, that chin village episode was great but Kyoshi appearing all of a sudden ruined the episode. #8221;</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I personally don #8217;t like Korra but it #8217;s just the archetype/personalities. Aang is so loveable because he #8217;s the innocent boy who just wanted everyone to get along but the era he is born in, forced him into a situation where he must quickly grow up and throw away his innocence in order to stop the war. Korra is a character who is born in a time where the avatar isn #8217;t needed, unlike Kuruk who used that time to mess around, Korra was constantly trying to prove to the world that she is this important person albeit in a horrible way by being selfish, arrogant and brash. Once she finally got what she wanted, she begins to self doubt herself that she #8217;s not good enough, or she #8217;s the worst avatar or she makes terrible decisions etc. So essentially Aang #8217;s change in the books are all forced onto him while Korra #8217;s change are all stemmed from herself and people don #8217;t usually like the latter. I don #8217;t care, since I want each and every avatar to be as different as possible but it #8217;s just Korra #8217;s  #8220;coming of age #8221; story isn #8217;t as well-liked by people.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>That #8217;s the point, when Zuko acts like an asswipe, there are always repercussions. His uncle will tell him that he #8217;s in the wrong etc and later on Zuko reflects on the action he #8217;s done. Korra kind of just get everything her way in the end even though she #8217;s clearly the unreasonable one. The protestor probably had the right to be there since he wasn #8217;t arrested for offensive behaviour nor did he get shut down by any council so that means he #8217;s likely to have a permit as well. You disagreeing with what the protestor says doesn #8217;t give you a right to punch them in the face so thankfully Korra didn #8217;t punch anyone in the face for that. Regardless though, her actions carry no consequences like how Tenzin exempted her from Lin #8217;s punishment, her destroying the training ground and blaming it on Tenzin #8217;s bad teaching or even or how she expected Mako to put her above his duties and responsibilities. She doesn #8217;t have to be a saint to be an avatar, in fact the avatar is about living through the human lives in order to understand their pain and suffering like Yangchen said but when it comes to writing, when all your negative actions carry no repercussions, it #8217;s just not good writing.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Zuko goes through the very human emotions of realising his errors. For Korra is like you said,  #8220;almost #8221;. She never did,  #8220;almost #8221; and instead of reflecting on it, she acts pretty smug about it. But did she realise why she is being negatively received? She just think it #8217;s the people #8217;s fault and not herself. It #8217;s ok, she #8217;s not perfect, she made a very brash decision but instead of reflecting on it, she thought she is right til the very end but no one really chastise her for it either. The only chastisement she got is the break up which is more of she going full psycho on Mako more than anything. I get that she is a hot-headed character and takes drastic measures in order to complete her job but she could #8217;ve been more well develop if it was like this for those scenarios. 1. Arrest by Lin She can act smug about it as she leave but then as she walks back with Tenzin, she walks at that very same street where she destroyed the cars and shops and realised the amount of damage she has caused for the civilians and how they need to clean up the mess. She looks at Tenzin and then looks down and say,  #8220; I was only trying to help them #8221; or something like that and Tenzin probably say something like it #8217;s alright and we will now teach you self discipline for you to master airbending and to avoid something like this again. 2. Lin and the Citizens don #8217;t like her Korra can confront Lin and tell her that she #8217;s trying to do her best for Republic City but she needs time. Then she can tell Lin how just because she #8217;s the avatar, it doesn #8217;t mean she is perfect, she can then say she is very human as well going through human emotions like everyone else, learning just like everyone else. 3. Break up with Mako After that, she can self reflect and think,  #8220;ok, what I did was wrong but there is no time or any other way, if I don #8217;t do something quick, Amon will hurt even more people #8221;. She can still retain a bit of her smugness with something like,  #8220;I know I did something wrong but you were my boyfriend, you should #8217;ve stood on my side, It #8217;s not like I #8217;m doing anything bad #8221;. This at least makes it that Korra knows she is in the wrong and is willing to grow from her past actions but her pride at the time makes her unable to admit she #8217;s wrong in front of the person she #8217;s arguing with. She knows what she #8217;s doing isn #8217;t exactly the right way to do it but due to the urgency of the matter, desperate times calls for desperate needs. So yea, the problem with Korra is that most of the side plot issues aren #8217;t really implemented into her personality, she walks in as X person and walk out as X person. Zuko walks in as X person and walks out as Y person because he learns from his actions. Even Aang, the side plot of him needing to learn firebending made him accidentally burn Katara which then became part of his personality. In Korra #8217;s writing, it would be Korra blaming whoever that got burned not getting out of her way when she firebended and someone like Tenzin would try to argue but give 10 minutes into the episode, Tenzin will then be like,  #8220;You are right, Korra. I see that how I got my hands mutilated is completely my fault for I stood near the avatar #8217;s vicinity when I shouldn #8217;t have, thank you for making me realise my errors. #8221;</TEXT>

I don #8217;t see Ming Hua doing any push and pulling with her body at all. There is also blood bending only working on full moons but Amon and his family can do it without the full moon because they are prodigies. When you are a prodigy, rules get thrown out the window so if the latter can do that, why can #8217;t Azula do lightning bending when she #8217;s already mastered the technique.</TEXT>

Amon is doing it in broad daylight! when Amon perform Bloodbending, he #8217;s such a massive prodigy that he can even take away other people #8217;s bending. It also does have to do with talent/technique. Hama shows with enough talent, you can also pull water from the moisture in the air or from flowers. There is still Ming Hua that you conveniently left out. There is also the thing Zaheer now that I think about it who needs to let go of his earthly attachment in order to fly but he is hellbent on killing the avatar which is a very earthly attachment. What does Toph being able to see or not got to do with her prodigy nature? What you said is not defying the laws of bending but the actual laws of the universe as we know it.

    <TEXT>Well the same could be said that lightning bending was thought that you need to have a clear mind but all you need is something else. She could #8217;ve swayed her body back and forth or something but she #8217;s done nothing and she can waterbend. She not needing to bend water without the basics is exactly the same thing as Azula which is what is thought to be common sense doesn #8217;t apply to certain characters most likely because they are prodigies. Toph and Ming Hua #8217;s situation is completely different, Toph still obeys the basics of earth bending, she doesn #8217;t use mind powers to face in a direction and a rock starts levitating, she like every other earthbender except Bumi (who can earth bend with his face) needs to stomp the ground to make the earth move. Toph feeling the vibration to see is an extension of her bending by feeling the tremors. Ming Hua literally skipped step 1 and went straight to step 2 (which is like Azula skipping step 1 (clear mind) and going straight to step 2 (shooting lightning)).</TEXT>

    <TEXT>From what I can see in the article, it at most says that he only used some quotes/speeches from Hitler. Unless the quotes are something like  #8220;Nazi is the best #8221; or  #8220;hail hitler #8221;, I don #8217;t really see how it means he supports nazi. Being fascinated by history and supporting a cause/agenda are 2 different things altogether. The article did not quote any of the speech/quote he said so I would assume that the quotes he used very likely had nothing to do with supporting nazi other than coming out of Hitler #8217;s mouth. I #8217;m just saying unless he directly supported the Nazi or said something that clearly shows his agenda to supporting the nazi cause, I think quoting a few quotes is not something that should brand you as a nazi, otherwise a lot of world war 2 fanatics will be branded as a nazi too.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Well I haven #8217;t seen Korra since release but my biggest gripe with Korra are: 1. Introduction of Republic City which took away the unique culture of each nation (Fire nation with Agni Ki, northern water tribe and their Venice like city) 2. The destruction of the avatar cycle which is what gave the avatar his/her identity. Now we won #8217;t get cool scenes like Roku demanding Jeong Jeong to teach Aang Fire Bending or Kyoshi tells what happened to Chin the Conquerer. The avatar state now feels like a power-up button to win and it doesn #8217;t carry as much meaning anymore 3. The magic of the spirit realm because that #8217;s free estate now now that it is open to the public. Instead of seeing cool spirits like Koh in the spirit realm or rare locations in the human world like Wan Shi Tong #8217;s library, we get to see some plant monster attack republic city... yay... this also makes the avatar feels less important because part of the role of the avatar is to be the bridge but now the spirit realm is free estate. 4. Finally, what I don #8217;t like about TLOK is the change of many established lore, some being the avatar was supposed to find it most difficult to learn the opposite element but Korra changed it based on their personality or how the avatar was supposed to be the planet #8217;s physical manifestation.</TEXT>

The issue I have with Republic city is that it #8217;s far too advance from ATLA to TLOK but this is to each their own when it comes to the environment but I personally would #8217;ve loved to see the world stay rural and maybe make a slow advancement to a more modern society. Overall, the change was too abrupt. 2. Maybe it #8217;s a good thing for Korra but for the series as a whole in terms of creativity and story telling, I think it #8217;s a bad move. It is interesting to see how Aang #8217;s ideal, morals and beliefs completely conflicted with Kyoshi and even conflicted with Yangchen as well who was raised that all lives are sacred. It #8217;s through these conversation that we are able to see what our current main avatar #8217;s true beliefs are because in the avatar universe, we are told the avatar #8217;s action are all made for the protection of the world and so though all the avatars have the same interest, it #8217;s very interesting to see how they differ from each other. Also having the past lives there allows for more story telling options because taking that away means there are less options and more is always better (now it just depends on how it is executed). It would have been cool to see what Aang #8217;s opinion of Zaheer is or his emotions of the resurgence of airbenders. That aside, as for the future of the series with the next avatar, it really takes away the identity of the avatar who isn #8217;t the bridge to the spirit realm anymore and the avatar cycle only gets access to one person, which doesn #8217;t showcase the unique qualities of the avatar who is a person who lived through a thousand lives who #8217;s role is always to maintain peace and can tap into that ability for power and guidance. Getting access to one person only (Korra) would feel more like a power-up or the next avatar having a guardian angel instead of the ability communicate his/her previous life which I guess, now makes the avatar feel like a regular shonen anime or video game main character. 3. I #8217;ll have to rewatch Korra to see but as far as it goes, the spirit realm was supposed to be a sacred placed that only the avatar, enlightened humans, and those that got kidnapped can enter. Now that it is opened, even Asami can enter. The fact that there are spirits in the human realm also makes the spirit feel less threatening and mysterious and more of just another inhabitants of the planet. In ATLA, the spirits occurrences are rare but when it does happen, no one knows what #8217;s going on because there is an air of mystery to them. 4. The planet manifestation is actually in an art book but it isn #8217;t too big of a deal about this point but it #8217;s just one of the nitpicks I have because they purposely changed the lore just to write a one-off narrative which is just bad imo. The story could #8217;ve went with Korra slowly learning her elements and because of fire bending difficulties, she did not try to learning airbending at all but Tenzin wants to make her practice airbending basics at least which is why she always get so cranky with his training. Fast forward, so by the time she fights Amon and had her bending taken away, that #8217;s when she use it for the first time. I mean i could have let it go if only Aang was having difficulty learning earth bending because his personality is that of an airbenders traits but Roku #8217;s manners and personality match more of a water bender but he states that water was the hardest to learn for him. Overall, what I #8217;m more annoyed about is them changing what is already establish purposefully instead of working with it or building upon it.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>The idea of an evil avatar is cool but the avatar itself is impossible to be evil but there is still the dark avatar but that doesn #8217;t interest me because it just devolve into a bland good vs evil plot (I mean that #8217;s the basis for everything but when it #8217;s literal light vs dark, the villain tend to don #8217;t have any great ambition other than to destroy the world for the sake of evil unlike Ozai who wants the fire nation to prosper and was carrying generations of work since Sozin). It would be interesting to see if the dark avatar plays a different role. The avatar is supposed to maintain peace but as General Old Iron said in the comics,  #8220;the avatar will always side with the humans #8221;, so they can change Vaatu is an avatar who always side with the villains. He is still the villains to humanity but he isn #8217;t just a one-note villain who wants to destroy just for the sake of evil. I also hope the dark avatar be more of an anti-hero kind of story.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>The great thing about Zuko #8217;s character is how he fights on no matter the circumstances or how unfair destiny treats him, he will always keep trying until he succeeds. You saying him being a prodigy completely insults and do a complete disservice for the character and his development. You are saying like as if all his hard work is just him being a prodigy all this time and all of his struggle is not real because he #8217;s a prodigy. Do you know why Ozai is abusive to Zuko? It #8217;s because in his eyes, he sees Zuko as a failure especially when compared to Azula (and possibly a certain letter from Ursa) You want more examples? Zuko failed his bending practice in front of Azulon or how Zuko never learned how to lightning bend but only to redirect.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>My recommendation from most to least. 1. Made in Abyss 2. Kimetsu no Yaiba 3. Violet Evergarden Made in Abyss if you want to feel sadness and despair (don #8217;t let the initial appearance fool you). It #8217;s very lore heavy too. Phenomenal graphics too. https://images.app.goo.gl/qc9uV58huP6MRrkUA (image is not a spoiler) Violet Evergarden if you want something that hit you on the feels each episode. Phenomenal graphics too. https://images.app.goo.gl/PLAnHAWvfzt44FUG6 (image is kinda spoiler but there is no greater plot as each episode is like its own story) Kimetsu no Yaiba if you want action and sympathy for just about every person in the anime, even the villains.

    <TEXT>Well that #8217;s because water bending movements are smooth and flowing so it #8217;s almost like a dance. Earth is rigid so that #8217;s why their moves have them stomping the ground or punching forward. Air is fast and nimble so you can see Aang is always doing quick swipes which is not suited for dances where the moves are smooth and elegant. As for fire, their source comes from aggression and aggression cannot be smooth, that #8217;s why you can see Zhao #8217;s firebending being very rough like he #8217;s about to flip a table or slam something. As for the fire dragon dance, it #8217;s still not flowing because of the pauses in between each step. Water however is always constantly moving, changing so that #8217;s why water looks very pleasant (except for foggy swamp style).</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I actually think Aang could #8217;ve stood a chance. Katara May say he would #8217;ve died but we don #8217;t know is she saying truly from the bottom of her heart OR that she thinks the Fire Nation of what she saw is the same fire nation 100 years ago. I #8217;m pretty sure the Advancement of technology either started with Azulon or Ozai as the Royal Gallery #8217;s picture shows Ozai #8217;s portrait with the technology but then there is the Azulon Gate. Anyway, it definitely did not start with Sozin so I doubt they had those war tanks that can climb mountains to invade the temples 100 years ago and so that means Aang would #8217;ve had a landscape advantage easily. Sozin is also a really old man at the point he attacked the air temples, so technically speaking, he should be easier to take down compared to Ozai if he even leads the invasion himself. There #8217;s also the question of whether Sozin knowing lightning bending or not since that was really the only threat that likely stood between Aang and stopping the war 100 years ago. The final problem would be Aang vainglorious powered up firebenders due to Sozin #8217;s comet but really, Aang would get the same power up as well and he would just go ham on everything nearby with his uncontrollable avatar state which would probably wipe out or at least scare off any invaders.</TEXT>

You can see Toph #8217;s hand direction where her fingers are pointing towards our assumed bottom end of the poster. She then slaps the paper onto the wall and you can see her fingers are pointing upwards so that means the bottom end of the poster is most likely point up now.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>So we know blood bending is not Energy Bending, Energy Bending is its own thing altogether. So how come Energy Bending can bring peoples #8217; bending back when they aren #8217;t even the same thing. We know Energy Bending isn #8217;t the all cure to fix every problem because when Aang couldn #8217;t go into the Avatar State, Energy Bending did not work for him there because Energy Bending can #8217;t affect disrupted chi paths. It was only because of a  #8220;certain rock #8221; that Aang was able to enter the avatar state again by unlocking his chi path once more, not energy bending. Bloodbending to take away someone #8217;s bending away is by disrupting their chi paths. Energy bending does not unlock chi paths, it simply gives or take away bending. Korra shouldn #8217;t be able to give people their bending back. She being able to do so either means Amon #8217;s bending is actually not blood bending but it #8217;s actually energy bending all along but we know that #8217;s not right because they keep telling us that it #8217;s blood bending and how does a person have energy bending when they are not the avatar or being granted by a lion turtle. There are so many issues with Korra but after rewatching ATLA, this seems like the biggest problem right now. There is also the issue of how Korra can bend air when Amon took her bending away but that #8217;s for another day.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I #8217;d imagine the lightning just caused a swell of blood that blocked the pathway and the rock simply crushed the clumped up blood that gathered which allowed his chi/blood to flow again. If Korra can send chi down to where blood is being blocked (surprise the people don #8217;t get a stroke at this point since Amon is doing the blood clotting on their forehead), then why can Aang just send enough energy down to dislodge that chi when a simple rock can do it.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Or maybe TLOK is full of plot holes and contradictions and you simply take what is given as the gospel even though it doesn #8217;t make sense at all. Bloodbending required the full moon to Bloodbend people but that #8217;s thrown out the window with Amon and his family whom his father can not only bloodbend in broad daylight, but by just batting his eyelids, he was able to bend a court full of people with no difficulties at all. Mind you even Katara the water bending master can #8217;t do that. Why does Amon need to press people #8217;s forehead like energy bending to block their chi? He #8217;s not energy bending and I doubt they have a video record of Aang energy bending so that he could imitate it. Why can Korra bend air when her bending got taken away? How come disrupting the chi path allows Korra to bend air regardless? There are many questions that TLOK didn #8217;t take into consideration and the energy bending to give people their bending back is one of them. EDIT: Let #8217;s also not forget how Aang can just pass down Energy Bending to Korra even though this was never possible because the avatar always needs to remaster all the elements in each life but hey, let #8217;s just throw that out as well because it will make a cool season finale.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>So Aang never knew if energy bending can bring back bending or not because other than his chi being blocked, there was never a point where someone #8217;s bending was taken away permanently (other than by energy bending) in Aang #8217;s lifetime. But all of a sudden, Aang know how to use energy bending on Korra like as if he knew all along?</TEXT>

    <TEXT>How many people can bloodbend? Oh! 5 total and we have 3 of them who can bend in broad daylight, without moving their hands and control a room full of people. Katara and Hama could only control 1 person and required a lot of moving in the full moon. Oh ok! Let #8217;s face it, they changed it because they wanted to make a  #8220;cool #8221; villain but it did not respect its lore. Ahh, the evidence of why not. I can #8217;t fight against that even though I #8217;ve presented evidence of what is possible and what is not but with the  #8220;why not #8221;, I truly have no grounds to stand on. This was probably for the  #8220;cool #8221; factor as well because before it was revealed to be Bloodbending, it was cool looking like as if he was doing energy bending, it was cool to do a twist that it actually isn #8217;t energy bending at all but we want to make you think it is. So then why didn #8217;t Amon take it away anyway? He knows she #8217;s the avatar and so it is logical to do that as well. I doubt the chi path just exist out of nowhere once Korra is able to airbend, if she doesn #8217;t have the chi path in the first place, it shouldn #8217;t be possible for her to Ben it in the first place because it simply isn #8217;t there. She can #8217;t tap into the energy source that don #8217;t exist but here #8217;s the problem, it doesn #8217;t make for a cool scene for Korra to airbend at that moment. Coolness comes before actual story writing after all.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Literally making up things on the spot just to suit the narrative. Blood bending is banned so there is no study other than Yakone using it on everyone. What next? Sang and Katara get kinky on the bed and used Bloodbending secretly? It could happen that he learned about chi and energy bending but in order to learn about energy bending, he need to apply it constantly to do tests but unless Katara keeps Bloodbending Aang #8217;s bending away as a kink, I don #8217;t see a scenario where Aang learned to do that.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Why is everyone so surprised about Yakone Bloodbending then? Why did Yakone present the full moon being required as an argument to bloodbending? Sokka literally had to give his little speech that say something along the lines of,  #8220;I bet you can blood bend in an unnatural way because I #8217;ve seen many shit before #8221; in order to explain that this shit is not normal. Now there #8217;s multiple ways of stealing a car, you can steal it using the old fashion way of robbing someone for their keys, hot wiring etc. or you can use the super advanced technology like this https://edition.cnn.com/videos/world/2017/11/27/relay-box-auto-theft-orig-trnd-lab.cnn Bloodbending is talked about in ATLA being the most advanced water bending a water bender can learn so it is obvious that if we relate it to stealing a car, it would be how these guys stole a car. Regarding the show #8217;s advancement, that #8217;s a whole different issue altogether. A mystical asiatic world with laws of the universe being very different to ours. The creators manage to mess that up to make it feel like ours. All the fantasy and magic of the show taken away just like that. That #8217;s for another day though. Now you can accept that Korra has flaws (a lot of them in fact) or you can hide in your little bubble and block out everything that makes you feel confused.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Hama bended 2 people at full moon mind you, Yakone bended probably at least 30 people in the courtroom with just his eyes... in broad daylight. I don #8217;t like him touching people #8217;s forehead because it was a bad attempt by the creators trying to make a plot twist but oh well, this is just nitpicking I admit, The last one, it has to exist somewhere, it can #8217;t not exist when she couldn #8217;t airbend and suddenly exist when can airbend, if she doesn #8217;t have the chi path, then she shouldn #8217;t even be able to learn airbending at all. We also know she has it because she #8217;s the avatar, the lion turtle gave it to Wan 10,000 years ago and so obviously the chi path is there. I #8217;ll tell you why Amon didn #8217;t take it away though, it #8217;s because it would make it cool when she can airbend when all hopes seem lost.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Airbending 1. Gas Bending Not too useful I guess since you can kind of manipulate gas already by using the wind travel but for argument sake, let #8217;s say gas bending has more precision. 2. Space Bending Airbending can only blow or suck things like a fan or vacuum but what if space Bending condense the air around that it makes it like a wall Waterbending 1. Steam Bending I don #8217;t think they #8217;ve shown this but it could just be part of water bending since water bending include freezing water to ice so I #8217;d imagine the reverse holds true (but then maybe not because Jet would think Iroh is water bending his tea then) Earthbending 1. Mercury Bending Bending liquid metal 2. Glass Bending Bend those mineral inside the glass 3. Plastic Bending Probably cause why not Firebending 1. Plasma Bending Beyond fire and lightning, plasma comes next.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>So I guess Katara trying to water bend is fake news, Aang and Roku trying to learn the other elements and master the avatar is definitely fake news because Korra can do everything in first go (except airbending to move the plot forward). Korra who is probably the weakest spiritually also managed to master the avatar state on her first try. Why did Aang and Roku give us fake news? I would say you can watch another person or scrolls in avatar universe to learn more but as we know it, Aang is literally the only person who can Energy bend.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>And I guess it advanced further that it did the energy bending with no drawbacks at all. It #8217;s simply a cheap way of making a big threat and on the way, it destroyed everything we knew about it.

    <TEXT>Oh, interesting. I never knew about the healing water to block chi paths. Is there a source for it? I think the main cause of Aang not being able to enter the avatar state is the chi being blocked and not the external injury. Aang at one point in book 3 said that he can #8217;t go into the avatar state because the chi is blocked, not because of the injury. The final battle with protruding rock also would add further injury to his injury but that wasn #8217;t the case, it unlocked something and he was able to enter the state again.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>And when she was a toddler, she was able to earth, water and firebend from the start. We know Kyoshi could only bend earth for the longest time until she breathed out fire when Yun got kidnapped by a spirit, Roku only learned how to airbend when he went to the southern temple and Aang learned how to water bend when Katara showed him how but Korra, oh no, she already know the basics as a toddler. Mastering is a different thing altogether. Yea everybody has different talent but Korra have so much talent that she can master the avatar state in one go even though she is said to be spiritually weak. Korra being a water element avatar was supposed to have difficulty learning fire but nope, lore is changed just to fit the narrative purpose. Roku is spreading fake news again about the element opposite to theirs was the hardest to learn. You see what ATLA did that was great? Though earth was supposed to be the hardest to learn for Aang, firebending became the hardest not because the creators wanted to drop their lore halfway but it was set up that he burned Katara with him goosing around with fire and that made him become scared of Fire because of how wild it can be. Man at this rate, Roku is just spreading fake news throughout ATLA because TLOK just keeps retconning what Roku said in ATLA.</TEXT>

Even the creators don #8217;t know how to explain it because they don #8217;t know how. They manage to explain (and butcher) the spirit world, bending and the avatar. I don #8217;t really mind about bloodbending can take away a person #8217;s bending but if it #8217;s as you explained about blood bending, it simply means that the bloodbending tampered with the access of magic within the person. Energybending as we know it, is giving or taking away the magic within the person so you can #8217;t give bending if the person already has bending but is unable to access it.</TEXT>

What #8217;s with the bullshit of before people bending energy before the avatar was a thing? That never happened in the flashback of TLOK. Why is everyone in ATLA spreading fake news? I #8217;ll tell you why, because the creator doesn #8217;t even know their own lore, Aaron Ehasz who is the head writer in ATLA was the one who build the lore, the 2 creators probably at most only conceptualised the world but that #8217;s it. That #8217;s why there are so many retconning in TLOK, it #8217;s because Aaron Ehasz did not return to work on it.</TEXT>

Not possible when Wan first became an avatar 10,000 years prior (which makes an avatar #8217;s lifespan being 10years. Now Kuruk feels like he #8217;s lived a long healthy life). What about the other thing about the avatar will cease to exist if he #8217;s killed in avatar state because that #8217;s impossible, Raava is literal immortal where there is darkness, there will always be light bullshit. Roku has no clue about his own history at this point. Forget being just a guy, he was spreading fake news and conspiracies along with the Lion Turtle. You keep falling back to the physical side of things but you never addressed her spiritual side and how she mastered avatar state in her first try. Excellent decision too?</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Plausible, I mean if it #8217;s essentially water bending that blocked the chi flow, I guess energy bending can  #8220;delete #8221; that water bending that causes the blockage. Pretty sure the chakra and chi are the same thing as chakra is just a large pool of Chi according to Pahtik but I would think it #8217;s due to a blood clot that caused Aang unable to enter the state and the rock free that clot when he collided into it. It #8217;s the most plausible explanation on why Aang/Korra can recover the bending later from Amon due to it being energy in nature unlike Aang #8217;s injury where it probably caused the clot and thus rendering it as physical.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Roku said he had the highest difficulty to learn water. As for Roku #8217;s personality, we see he #8217;s always lived in Sozin #8217;s shadow and he is so shy that he can #8217;t talk to the girl he likes. When he #8217;s learning the elements, he is being cheeky with Gyatso and pouring tea for his earthbending master after beating him. We see he avoided dealing with Sozin twice with the first being in his wedding and the second time where he didn #8217;t take Sozin #8217;s life. In the comics. Throughout his appearance as a spirit, he is always calm and wise and in the comics, he even missed Aang when Aang cut connections with him. No matter how you look at it, he does not possess the trait of a firebender and more of an airbender now that you look at it, always passive and always avoiding the issue (which is that very reason that Sozin started the war). So why? Why does he have highest difficulty learning water and not earth then? When Aang was learning earthbending, it was said that it was hardest for him to learn because it was his polar opposite element. It is so hard for them to learn it is because the practice of the bending art is complete opposite. You said it yourself, as soon as he adopted the earthbender stance, he was able to earthbend. Air bending has always been about deflecting and avoiding while earth bending is about standing your ground, the 2 art/bending are complete polar opposite in the way it is executed. It is the hardest to learn because everything they know and incorporated into their lifestyle has to be thrown out because the opposite element is what it is, an opposite.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Yea I don #8217;t think he went from an airbender personality (before being revealed as an avatar) to a fiery, angry chap and back to a calm person especially when we get 3 instances of his personality mid training. First being at air temple, 2nd is at the earth bending lesson and third with him trying to master the avatar state. Not once in any of those instances did they show him being out of control. At most he showed frustration of unable to learn the avatar state (for five months) which Aang have shown numerous time when he got frustrated when he #8217;s unable to something as well and Aang #8217;s whole saga barely happened in a season. So we have evidence of his personality before and after his avatar training, clips of him training where he doesn #8217;t appear to be rude and brash and you want to tell me that he could have adopted a fire benders personality during the training ONLY? Yea, not plausible at all. From Toph as well when Aang was trying to tackle the rock from a different angle, Toph said specifically that he got to  #8220;stop thinking like an airbender #8221;. Then there is the thing with Roku again who has an airbender #8217;s personality but you are trying to magically insert this one moment of ambiguity because it will help your narrative. Aang #8217;s personality is like a kid and even when he #8217;s grown up, he might look more serious but with one photo of Aang in TLOK, we know he is still who he is but probably is more wise now like Roku shown throughout ATLA by guiding Aang. https://images.app.goo.gl/BTwMMn6YMmpWUX7E6 Same applies to Sokka with his quote of his trusty boomerang, you know that he is still the same Sokka but probably have gone more wise just like Aang and Roku. Toph is still the same person as she is in ATLA and TLOK who is bold and direct but probably just a bit more cynical now. Even Zuko who undergoes the biggest transformation compared to any character is still the kind and gentle boy that he always has been. The reason he got banished for speaking out of terms about sacrificing the soldiers. As he traveled with Iroh, he sounds like he doesn #8217;t care about the crew safety but we know that it was just him being hotheaded because he prioritised the crew safety in the end over chasing Aang. When his  #8220;honour #8221; is restored after the control of Ba Sing Se, he wanted to speak out about the nefarious war plan of destroying the land of the earth kingdom because he knew it is wrong to do so but he was scared. Not once did his personality ever portrayed him to be a huge asshole other than getting in the way of Aang. He never purposely hurt anyone for no reason. At first/second episode we can already see that he is reasonable because Aang offered to sacrifice himself for the safety of the village which Zuko agreed and never went back on. What you are claiming with Roku #8217;s personality is that he underwent a 180 personality change during his training and then went back another 180 personality change by the time he finished. That is just ridiculous. There is a huge difference of you actually being proved wrong and you being ignorant and think you are not wrong and you clearly fall in the latter.</TEXT>

    <TITLE>Kira Yoshikage vs Funny Valentine</TITLE>
    <DATE>2019-09-22 11:08:56</DATE>
    <TEXT>No Stray Cat/Bite the Dust/Love Train. D4C doesn #8217;t work if Valentine doesn #8217;t squish his target with something himself and so that means Valentine needs to get close to Kira so he is within Kira #8217;s range. Kira can also transfer the bomb from anything he touch to whoever touches that object next and Valentine will have to touch something for him to use D4C. But then at the same time, D4C can bring another Kira and they just sponge together if they get too close. So I think if the fights are like so: 1. If both users are unaware of each other #8217;s ability, it will be depending on the distance. If it #8217;s close range, Killer Queen would likely blow Valentine up but if it #8217;s far range, Valentine can just appear from some corner and shoot him. If they don #8217;t even meet face to face, it will likely be Kira with Sheer Heart Attack since it #8217;ll blow up on contact with Valentine (Sure, Valentine can transfer it to another dimension but Sheer Heart Attack is really fast that even Star Platinum with super precision wasn #8217;t really able to keep up with him while Valentine has always been put in a near death state before he could slip away to another dimension). 2. If both users are aware and had no time to prepare, Kira would likely win since Kira can just blow whatever Valentine tries to squeeze him and say Valentine tries to use a door, Kira can transfer the bomb from the door to Valentine and blow Valentine up which is pretty instant. 3. If both users are aware and had time to prepare, it #8217;s likely Valentine going to win since he can bring an army of himself and release a Kira so they would sponge together. who do you think will win?</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I don #8217;t think it #8217;s possible to use Bite the Dust on top of Bite the Dust. Bite the Dust activates by having Kira place Killer Queen into a host being Hayato in this case and the Bite the Dust seem to act dormant from that point on until it is activated, which will then rewind the day it is activated on. We know it needs a host to activate since Bite the Dust effect deactivated all together when Kira called Killer Queen back to his side. So he can #8217;t activate Bite the Dust again since it isn #8217;t an ability that he manually triggers like his first bomb type.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Do you mean when Kira accidentally killed Hayato in the bathroom or do you mean when Bite the Dust first killed Rohan? Either way, Bite the Dust will just explode whoever tries to find out about Kira. So if Hayato tries to tell his Mother who Kira really is, Shinobu will explode and then the day resets but now the exploding order will be 1. Shinobu early in the morning 2. Rohan at 8:30? 3. Duwang gang at 8:35? (Can #8217;t remember the exact times) So to break it down, Bite the Dust has 3 effects 1. initial activation rewind 1 hour and Kira is fully aware of what happened in that 1 hour that got rewind but no one else remembers (This is to protect Kira from leaving town). 2. Bite the Dust lays dormant in a host and if anyone tries to ask about Kira #8217;s identity from the host, Bite the Dust activates and blows the person up and Bite the Dust then rewinds the time possibly up to the point where Kira turns back one hour but we don #8217;t know since it seems like Hayato was asleep at that point so we only see him wake up and the day begins. 3. Bite the Dust then compiles all the rewinded days together and proceeds to blows up each and every person that found out about Kira at the time they found out about Kira.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>If I choose an existing power, it would be Killer Queen. This guy is stacked with abilities, bombs, sheer heart attack and bite the dust to rewind time. If it #8217;s an original stand, I would want a close-ranged stand and maybe it can make clones on one hand with whatever he is touching with the other hand. Of course the stand power will be an activation effect like Killer Queen #8217;s bomb instead of it being continuous like The Hand otherwise it #8217;ll get messy real quick trying to hold anything.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>We don #8217;t get to see enough of Bite the Dust activation but from the episodes shown, Bite the Dust is likely just one big ability (because Kira said Bite the Dust is his 3rd bomb so if reviving Hayato was its own thing, it would #8217;ve been a fourth bomb) where it activates when Kira places Killer Queen into Hayato. Once Killer Queen is in the host, time rewinds by exactly 1hr and then the day continues with only Kira having recollection what had happened in that hour (Kira told Hayato that he killed him the night before but then he gained Bite the Dust which allowed him to reverse Hayato #8217;s death and Hayato have no recollection of that rewind). Now whenever time rewinds, it won #8217;t be Kira who have the recollection but rather the host will have the memories of it. I also don #8217;t believe he can use Bite the Dust on himself since that stand #8217;s effect is to protect Kira #8217;s identity and he needed to stop the effect so he could call back Killer Queen to protect himself from Josuke. If he could have just used Bite the Dust on himself, he could just do that and then went up to the Duwang gang and exposed himself to them which would then activate Bite the Dust and blow them all up, he would also have recollection of the duwang gang #8217;s death so he can just keep reliving the days until he got everyone. That wasn #8217;t the case though and Kira along with 99% of JoJo casts that isn #8217;t named Okuyasu have galaxy brains that can deduce every step of their opponent so I doubt Kira wouldn #8217;t be able to think of using Bite the Dust on himself if he could. So I would say it is safe to say Bite the Dust can #8217;t be used on himself. So we know Kira most likely can #8217;t use it on himself, we know that Kira won #8217;t use it on a person who doesn #8217;t know his identity because the risk of revealing himself is not worth it so Shinobu and neighbours are out and we know it isn #8217;t a separate ability that only blast 1hr back to the past because Kira announces Bite the Dust as his third bomb (and we know bomb 1 and 2 didn #8217;t haven #8217;t any weird properties outside of what it does either so it #8217;s safe to say bomb 3 follows that rule too) and so that only really leaves Hayato being the host when he activated the ability to go back 1hr in time.</TEXT>

    <TITLE>Not Much Humanoid Stands in Part 7</TITLE>
    <DATE>2019-09-22 18:27:49</DATE>
    <TEXT>And even when there are humanoid looking stands or any stand that takes on a form, they appear to just be a form and doesn #8217;t serve any further purpose other than the look or to punch things in like D4C, In a Silent Way, Tusk etc. I really like stands that actually need to be there for the user to use it #8217;s powers like Star Platinum #8217;s precision, Hieraphant #8217;s emerald splash, Crazy Diamond #8217;s healing, The Hand #8217;s hand, Purple Haze #8217;s virus. These stands put a clear distinction that these powers are exclusive to the stand and not a power the user can do with the stand manifestation being a bonus prize like how Funny Valentine can travel through dimension by squishing himself unlike Vanilla Ice who can only go to the pocket dimension by having Cream eat him. I really like Part 7 but it #8217;s just kind of disappointing that there weren #8217;t many cool stands since Part 7 stands are just special powers for the user or the stand manifestation is an item like Dio #8217;s Scary Monsters, H.P #8217;s meat spray, Ringo #8217;s watch.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I don #8217;t think Sheer Heart Attack would work if there is a second Kira since Sheer Heart Attack is actually the hand of Kira (when Echoes uses Freeze on Sheer Heart Attack, Kira #8217;s hand was affected too). So if Sheer Heart Attack approaches Kira, it will sponge his hand off. I think Kira can ably place one bomb at a time but if we are talking about preparation, he technically can prepare a battlefield where there is nothing for Funny to get in between but still, an army of Valentine with guns will pretty much destroy Kira.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I don #8217;t take stand stats as be all end all since it has Hol Horse Emperor #8217;s Precision and speed on the lower end but it could easily manoeuvre Silver Chariot who have super precision and speed that he can stab air and fire in between each other. Having said that, D4C is still very likely to be faster than Killer Queen but Valentine loves touching things because that #8217;s the main way to get to other dimension, Killer Queen can transfer his bombs to another person like the 100 yen to Shigechi. The door to Shigechi again and Okuyasu to Hayato. We #8217;ve seen the sponge could be countered easily and like all main villains, Kira has galaxy brain. Another flaw with the sponge is that Valentine will need to get to another dimension first, since they couldn #8217;t prepare it means that he would need to go to another dimension mid battle and sure you can say D4C is fast but Valentine is slow and is always in a near death state (and got interrupted more than once) before he could travel. Kira would have easily blown him up at that time. Also say Valentine is able to get to another dimension then, I doubt Valentine will able to find and capture a Kira from another dimension as well which I doubt any Kira from any dimension would allow anyone to get close to him in the first place.</TEXT>

    <TITLE>Johnny and Gyro probably had the most genuine friendship feel</TITLE>
    <DATE>2019-09-23 08:02:20</DATE>
    <TEXT>It feels like their relationship is a real thing and not just a work of fiction. I forgot who they said it to (I think it was to either Hot Pants or Dio) but Gyro wanted Johnny to tell the person to eat shit or something and Johnny just tells Gyro to say it himself. That part cracked me up so much. There was also the occasional Cheese song and terrible jokes from Gyro where Johnny loved it. There was also the secret sharing just before Love Train. Their relationship just felt so genuine where they do have different opinions and what not but they aren #8217;t played over the top. It was also great to see how Johnny who is super selfish sacrificed the corpse #8217;s ears and right arm to save him but before that, Johnny actually wavered and was thinking to run away. Most Fiction will have the main character do it without a second thought or if they are the coward type, would make a big scene out of it before saving their friend in a humorous manner but this one felt so different, Johnny saved Gyro but you can see his frustration on giving up the pieces. Part 4 used to be favourite because of how amazing and genuine Kira felt as a character but Part 7 became have now become my favourite part just because of Johnny and Gyro #8217;s relationship. Am I the only one who feels this bromance to feel like it #8217;s flowing like a real thing and not a work of fiction?</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I personally think JoJo part 5 Golden Wind to be one of the weakest JoJo parts too. It #8217;s something only JoJo fans can appreciate but coming from the outside, it feels very formulaic and feels like it #8217;s just action with nothing else (doesn #8217;t help Giorno does some ass pull for powers). I recommend starting at Part 3 Stardust Crusaders or Part 4 Diamond is Unbreakable. Part 3 is very battle oriented as well but everyone tends to start there while Part 4 has more fun or chill moments and the main character Josuke will only have 1 power throughout the whole part so you see him use his powers in very interesting ways unlike Golden Experience where he practically has a different power every episode until the 2nd half.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I enjoyed Part 7 a lot more too, Gyro was such a fun bloke and his relationship with Johnny felt like a real relationship and not a work of fiction. Josuke and Okuyasu was cool but something felt missing, like just the little things the characters do and so this is why Kira felt so real too, we learn so much of his lifestyle and his little habits which made him felt so real and even scarier that he is a serial killer. Funny Valentine is probably 2nd best JoJo villain after Kira though. Part 4 and 7 is too good but ultimately, I agree with you that Part 7 is better because of the story and Johnny/Gyro bromance.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Johnny kind of brought it on himself. His dad was a knob don #8217;t get me wrong, especially with what his father said that he wished it was Johnny who died instead. That shit is fucked up and hearing that from a figure that you loved and respected is just horrible. When he got shot though, he kinda brought it on himself since he got too arrogant. Granted, getting shoot on the back for a spot is a whole lot extreme but dude was a dick at that moment. I think the one with the worst life is Jonathan. His dog got killed, his father got killed, his best friend got killed, had to kill his (foster) brother. Finally gets to settle down with the love of his life and immediately said foster brother comes back to kill him. He never got to see his son grow up and being back in the 1900s or something, he must #8217;ve been filled with regret as he probably wouldn #8217;t know how Erina would be able to survive as a single mother.</TEXT>

What Guden wants is a dragon with a lot of combo damage, something like Arctos, Leviathan or Marishiten. Maybe a light version of Chthonius (hoping to be Elysium at this point) will scratch that itch for Guden?</TEXT>

    <TEXT>as far as I can remember Euden is the only Adventurer who has below 500% damage modifier on an S1 that deals damage. Most adventurers have around 700%-1000% total (Veronica on low health deals around 2500% and Ramona S1 deal 3000%, Crazy). So even if he equips a skill dragon, the skill damage amp doesn #8217;t really have much to scale on. Then there is the issue of trying to activate your S1 constantly to get it #8217;s return value worth it but there are a few issues like Guden #8217;s S1 takes roughly 10sec to change if his combos are not interrupted (so give or take 12-17sec in a proper fight), the other issue is him needing to hold onto his S1 to iframe certain attacks. Usually you can go into a shopping spree once your S2 charged up but Guden don #8217;t get that luxury. This is why skill dragons tend to only be suited for lance, bow and wand users (with few exceptions like Mym). They tend to charge their S1 in about 7sec give or take and especially wand users tend to have extremely high scaling for their S1. Hopefully Chthonius does well enough otherwise it might end up discontinuing like Nyarlathotep.</TEXT>

Is there some kind of joke that I #8217;m getting r/wooshed? I died once because one guy chased me down to 2 different corners and I tried to go into a third corner but it was too late.</TEXT>

You #8217;re the healer and sure, it #8217;s the healers job to heal the team BUT it #8217;s also the job of everyone else to not overburden the healer. If you can #8217;t survive chasers, it #8217;s because your team messed up too much in the beginning and it #8217;s not on you to pick up their slack. This is the hardest content in the game and so they should be able to play without getting hit most of the time (having said that, I always get hit by the triple tornado once or twice per match).</TEXT>

    <TEXT>If you make a direct nerf, people will cry about it since they can #8217;t handle the one thing that makes them semi-competent in the game is gone. So in order to fix this, there needs to be indirect nerfs. We know HDTm add new moves so no doubt HJP Master will also add new moves. Some ways to counter balance the Gleo dominance are: 1. HJP having his own chaser + Tattered Sky combo with the chaser targeting a specific weapon type in the battle and then the tattered sky will need at least 3 people to tank it. This stops people from bringing 4 Gleo or 3 Gleo + Healer team comps. 2. HJP body turns any buff zone into debuffs. This directly counters Gleo #8217;s buff zones. 3. HJP will place lightning rods on the field and if those rods are destroyed, it will send out a large pulse of electricity which attacks any players within it #8217;s reach. This will directly counter Gleo #8217;s S1. I #8217;m not saying all these should be implemented but having just one of these should make Gleo, a less dominating force in HJP easily.</TEXT>

There really isn #8217;t much I can teach when it comes to HJP though since it #8217;s Gleo Strat or gtfo. I just recently started on HZD standard since just a day ago, I didn #8217;t even have a MUB Cupid and right now PUG is a nightmare because all the Guden #8217;s don #8217;t know how to roll out of poison breath #8217;s way and even if they do, they can #8217;t seem to survive the 4 dash part.

    <TEXT>I developed a technique to actually only require one baiter for the whole thing (since I hate other baiters doing it wrong) and it works perfectly when the baiter get 2nd canoes. I think it only works for lance though but here are the steps. 1. You bait HBH towards as always (so then Thaniel can do Dive Cancel shenanigans) but here is what you need to do then. 2. Whenever you use your FS (I do it after my full combo), instead of ramming it straight into HBH, change the angle to between HBH and the wall. This will make the lance user try to wedge between HBH and the wall which in turn, push HBH away from the wall a bit. Just rinse and repeat this step until the canoes come up. Now if you don #8217;t get the 2nd cano landing on top of your head. 3. There will be enough gap for you to fit between HBH and the wall easily so you can bait breath towards the wall easily. If you do get 2nd cano. 3. Stay in position and the cano should drop on you and clip HBH on the corner which will push her towards the Center of the map a bit and a bit diagonal away from which ever direction she got clipped by the cano. This is small enough that it won #8217;t cause her to teleport and will make it extremely easy to bait flame breath as you then need to roll once to the other side of her.</TEXT>

    <TITLE>SPOILER: How do you interpret The Accursed Archive Ending?</TITLE>
    <DATE>2019-10-31 17:43:34</DATE>
    <TEXT>I know this was discussed long before when the event first came around but now that it made a round trip, I #8217;m interested to see how you guys view the ending. This is how I interpret the ending. After Heinwald approached Nyarl and revealed that he knows black Nyarl was manipulating everyone, Nyarl said that  #8220;those who fathom the abyss are beguiled by such... or are the abyss itself #8221;. He then transform into Heinwald and it ends. The abyss could be referring to a species or a group of organism that lives in or associate with this abyss and I would think the two Nyarlathotep are one of or part of the  #8220;abyss #8221;. I think what this means is that Nyarl is telling Heinwald that he sooner or later would become the next Nyarlathotep. We don #8217;t usually see the same dragon more than once but we do know multiple of the same dragon exist like in Curran #8217;s story, he stopped someone selling a fake Ifrit egg so that means there is definitely more than one Ifrit. Here #8217;s the thing with Nyarlathotep, both Nyarl is an emissary for the ancient one, so I would imagine it is implied that these dragons are chosen instead of reproduced. Nyarlathotep in HP Lovecraft is an entity who is a master of manipulation and deception which is both cases of Nyarl in Dragalia. When Nyarl said Heinwald  #8220;ken their words #8221;, I think means he understood the trickery and lies the Nyarlathoteps do instead of saying Heinwald understood their weird way of talking. So Heinwald knew the deception from both Nyarl but instead of busting them out, he deceived everyone, played along and string them to his bidding in the end. Now returning back to the quote on the top, Nyarl said those who fathom the abyss, are beguiled by such. I guess this implies those who are fascinated by Nyarl, are usually tricked by Nyarl #8217;s deception and manipulation but for Heinwald, he was not fooled by the Nyarls like Euden and co and played UNO reverse on the Nyarls himself which makes him the next master of deception.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I thought that #8217;s Nyarlathotep transforming into Heinwald. You see some particle effects from the transitioning of Nyarl to Heinwald, we also know white Nyarl can transform into human too (as Lathna) so kinda reasonable to expect the same. Nyarlathotep in Lovecraft also can transform into a thousand forms so I kind of drew the parallel there but now that you mention it, the transforming sequence isn #8217;t similar to how Dragalia usually handle transforming with it #8217;s purple mist/flame and what not. Now I #8217;m more confused than ever since I never considered Heinwald could just be releasing his dark energy at this time and is saying the quote himself...</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Referring back to the number points above. 1. It #8217;s actually a two-man job for this one, the melee need to bait HBH to dash to the top of the screen first so there will be a huge distance between HBH and her target. The Thaniel at this point needs to run to the opposite end (so the bottom end) of the screen after the first swipe. I think due to the large distance between HBH and her target (she targets the furthest away) is too large, she will do a swipe instead of a dive which is potentially lethal to your team. She will then do a 2nd dive after the first canoe so as Thaniel, you need to run down to the bottom of the screen again to cancel that dive as well. Any subsequent dive afterwards in the game needs to be canceled by the baiter except for the one after X-Mus since that one is impossible. 2. After the Waterfall, HMC will use her prison on the player furthest away so this requires Welly to be in third salvation bubble at the time so she can get into position to be the furthest one away from HMC (so hopefully Noelle doesn #8217;t run to the end of the screen but Noelles tend to be pretty switched on regarding the battle). Once she baits the prison, she needs to run towards the melee team and go behind HMC so it doesn #8217;t put the team at risk in front of the Homing Bubble. 3. The Fleur really only apply to the Gueden Strat but essentially when HZD uses his cage which targets the 2 players furthest away from him, you want the 2 Gueden to be free because swords shreds OD bar. This is very important because there will be a team damage from HZD that will leave your health too low to continue the fight so Gueden needs to break HZD before the damage happens, but there will always be that Fleur who thinks his tap-happy combo is too pro that it #8217;s worth sacrificing a Gueden. 4. HMS spits 3 tornadoes towards the player closest to him, you as the baiter needs to make HMS spit at the direction furthest away from your team mate. There #8217;s no helping if your 3 teammates are scattered everywhere but if they are all gathered up into one spot and you bait it to them, I advise you to change roles. It #8217;s still your fault if you can #8217;t bait his tornado anywhere else because the baiter is also the person who baits his charges so how many space you get to work with is dictated by you. 5. The red markers that follow a single player, that is when everyone need to gather up to spread the damage instead of one guy tanking it all. Only time you don #8217;t gather is when the bloke is clearly trying to separate so he can dragon tank the damage or when someone is dead already or everyone is too low of a health and the battle is near its end so it #8217;s better for that person to just take one for the team.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>That #8217;s the thing though, you really don #8217;t need top tier characters to win. The dragon, weapon and wyrmprints are what makes up the bulk of the adventurer and only are there a few where its must have because of coop toxicity like Gleo. You said you #8217;re a returning f2p player so I #8217;d say it just in case, use a MUB 4* Dragon like Juggernaut over 3UB any 5* dragon is the general rule of thumb. Since Wyrmprints are now easily obtainable, get MUB copies of desired prints and equip them (Resounding Rendition or anything with Skill Damage is highly preferred, next best stat is strength so Jewels of the Sun is the next best general print). If you can #8217;t beat this nightmare, I #8217;d recommend you upgrade your library to lv30 first by using Hustle Hammers if you have to. Next build a team of dark adventurers from your list of best ones. You can bring a Gala Euden or an off element healer as well if required (they probably need to be controlled). So what #8217;s the problem, why are you losing? Not enough damage or kept dying too quickly? If it #8217;s the former, use a Elisanne helpers to boost your damage and use adventurers like Gala Euden, Gleo or even bring Elisanne as your off colour pick as well. If it #8217;s the latter where it #8217;s an issue surviving, try using helper like fire Verica (I love her healing, it #8217;s too stronk) and then use teams like Patia and Heinwald. If it #8217;s both, Patia is like the perfect combo but you need to get 4 MUB copies of Odd Sparrows. Also you #8217;d want a wand/blade adventurer for their coab to hit harder and a lance/axe coab to survive longer. If you give me a list of your dark adventurers or an image of it, I can help you further with it.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>To the guy who said you can #8217;t beat Nightmare and Masters, here #8217;s the big reply I typed out before you deleted your comment. 1st thing I #8217;ll recommend you to do is use Hustle Hammers to get your library to lv30, its 150% extra damage. Delphi is 2nd or 3rd best dark adventurer (provided against poisonable foe but his S1 debuff is great regardless). For Patia, since you have issue living, get yourself 4 MUB copies of Odd Sparrow and equip each one to your team. Odd Sparrow is a 4* print but the effects gives you healing and str whenever you receive a Def buff which is provided by Patia #8217;s S1. First thing you need to do and I beg of you is upgrade your adventurers from 40MC to at least 46 (so everything except the coabs with eldwater). The difference in stats and power is far too great. Delphi comes with the third best coab too so get him to 50/50 nodes. Audric and Patia is definitely worth upgrading to 50/50 mana nodes too. Equip all 3 of them with a MUB Juggernaut each. Juggernaut at MUB gives out 45% Str which is better than a lot of 5* dragons that haven #8217;t reach MUB yet. For your fourth damage If it #8217;s damage, I #8217;d lean on Victor because you don #8217;t have Cupid for Gueden and Victor #8217;s coab will come in handy. So 50/50 Victor too. Either way, you can use Gala Euden as damage support or Victor. Give Gueden MUB Lindworm and Victor MUB Roc. Try out the 4 Odd Sparrow prints first but if you still need health, like I said, bring a Veronica helper and if that still don #8217;t work, bring a healer adventurer. Out of all the ones you #8217;ve listed, I #8217;d use H.Lowen since he can give you extra health to survive and equip a Phoenix on him. For 2nd print options, give Delphi a MUB Twinfold Bonds, give Audric A MUB The Shining Overlord, give Victor or Gueden a MUB Resounding Rendition and you can give Patia a MUB Hitting the Books for now (you can get Luca #8217;s Prank too which will come to use one day if you tackle HJPe). And of course your weapons should be a 5* tier 3 weapon but if you can #8217;t make it for each adventurer, get them a MUB 4* tier 3 over a 5* tier 2 weapon. And just to be clear, all those things listed above should be max level. I #8217;ll be honest with you, the reason you are losing isn #8217;t because the game is treating you unfairly, you are losing because you did not even put any effort into your adventurers at all. It #8217;s unreasonable to expect to beat the 2nd latest end game contents when none of your things are remotely close to launch end-game stats. And you can finally make up the difference with skills, it #8217;s a cop out answer but it #8217;s true nonetheless, once you are able to meet everything I listed for you above, you should have no problem tackling this content. As for top tier adventurers that you should focus to raise from now on, the few you should focus on includes Gala Euden, Victor, HMym, SCelli, HElli, Yachi, Fleur, Noelle and Delphi. Ezelith and Lucretia are usable, Hawk is not but not every pull needs to be god OP. My wind team are filled with non-meta adventurers except Addis and Victor. My wind team consist of Wind Aoi, Sylas, Granzal and Addis before I picked up Noelle and Victor but I had no problem winning and it #8217;s because of the gears. Even Hawk was close to beating HMCm so while I say hes not usable, it #8217;s just a gross exaggeration to say he #8217;s outclassed now.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>A lot of these can be salvaged, 1 can be salvaged if everyone knows to roll away twice away from the furthest player and it will be fine and dandy, 3 is manageable if the OD bar is already pretty low, ranged teams have enough time to roll away for 4 and 5 can be solo dragon tanked but it #8217;s as you said, it #8217;s not ideal.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Let #8217;s skip the part of Curran and Lathna because while it is cute, it isn #8217;t what have ya boggled. Let #8217;s dive into the meet of Heinwald meeting Akasha. I have three things that I want to dissect further in their conversation because it #8217;s all very cryptic and riddled. 1. Akasha said,  #8220;What is the goal of the cock who crows long before the coming of dawn? #8221; 2. Akasha said,  #8220;The drowsing, faceless fragment still remains here, yes? #8221;. 3. Heinwald said,  #8220;Why would you think... that I am not awakened? #8221;. So for point number 1, would it be fair to say that this analogy means that Akasha was warning people of the inevitable coming of the ancient one? Since the goal of the cock who crows before dawn is to wake everyone up due to dawn is coming. Who or what is the drowsing, faceless fragment? Is she referring to Lathna #8217;s Nyarlathotep since like Heinwald and Curran said, there are likely to be many Nyarl and they take on many forms so it #8217;s fair to say that Nyarl is faceless. The fact that Lathna goes into a trance to go into Nyarl form supports the drowsing part as well. Or it could be talking about the Hasturs in the village, they gained eternity but are now in a dream of endless torment and they lost their identity (so they are faceless) for they are all Hasturs now. OR it could be talking about Heinwald for he is the only one who still remains there and how the 3rd point seem to make reference to the first two points and the vague ending of Accursed Archive. Point 3, is Heinwald saying this just to continue his analogy of the cock who crows and that he is asking why does Akasha think that he #8217;s not aware of the inevitable? Or is he saying that he is the drowsing, faceless fragment? Or could he be the ancient one this whole time since the whole mission is about awakening the Ancient One. I can #8217;t even begin to decipher this one since those 3 points are so vague and ambiguous that I don #8217;t know are they all linked or are they all separate. What do you guys think?  #8212; #8212;EDIT #8212; #8212; Putting more thought into this, I think this is how it would roughly translate to (kind-of) layman #8217;s term. Akasha: Why do you think a rooster make noise just before  #8220;dawn #8221;? So why do you think I did this? Heinwald: I have my answer, it is to wake people up to see the  #8220;dawn #8221;. So you are bringing this to everyone #8217;s attention. Akasha: No, you have half of the answer. Heinwald: and the other half? Akasha: Lathna is still here, yes? I need to wake up the inner Nyarlathotep inside of her. Heinwald: ... Akasha: No matter, let #8217;s talk about you instead, I find you very interesting so how about you join me and watch this  #8220;dawn #8221; together? Heinwald: Before I accept your invitation, I have another question. Akasha: Go on. Heinwald: Why would you think I #8217;m not already awake to watch this  #8220;dawn #8221;? This is just how I interpret the story and it #8217;s not definitive but I feel like Heinwald is not referring to himself as a Nyarl or the ancient one but someone who is either very aware or is plotting something behind the scenes.</TEXT>

I find you interesting indeed, sir. Perhaps you might watch the coming of the new dawn with me? This sounds like an invitation to Heinwald to join her by her side to see this new dawn. So essentially she is telling Heinwald to stop being asleep, wake up and watch the twilight with her. That #8217;s when Heinwald said point 3 meaning, which is now how I interpret as,  #8220;how do you know it not part of this scheme already? #8221;</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Unless you need HD2 to beat the new bosses but overall, that #8217;s just stupid progression. Hopefully they just release Standard, Expert and Master from the get-go and Master (and maybe Expert) would require HD2 to beat. As for the prize, maybe similar weapons to HD1 and HD2 but instead of offensive skills like HD weapons are, make them into either healing skills or support skills because atm, healers are cucked really hard by the new weapons. I didn #8217;t know Mikoto was datamined to have 6th MC, man my boi is just getting stronger and stronger. To be fair though, Ruin is very hard to use, like 1/15 games I might be able to pull off Ruin against HMS.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Well overall Vayu, Agni and Akasha is some energy thing in Hinduism. Even if Akasha is a LC avatar, she #8217;s still not a dragon which baffled me since she had the horns and claws and everything. Seems like Hinomoto is based on asian gods specifically and while Marishiten/Marici is a god in Buddhism and Taoism, it is a god originated from India since Buddhism is originally from India. Then there is the big question of why Ieyasu is the clan leader (who is clearly Japanese origin) instead of a Chinese adventurer if it wants to follow a Chinese theme. We #8217;ll just have to wait for NY to see if it follows a theme or not.</TEXT>

Mitsuhide does not need Yachi to help her maintain Paralysis because Mitsuhide #8217;s S1 SP cost is only 2641 which. Takes around 5sec to charge. Her paralysis for 13sec so she has a large enough window to recharge the SP. For skill 2, Mitsuhide #8217;s max damage is 1417.5% and it boosts her attack rate by 10% which means now she can charge her S1 and S2 even faster for 10sec. Fleur May give instant S1 and 25% Str for 5sec but then Mitsu has 20% Flurry Str and 30% Para Punisher to make up for it while Fleur only has 20% Para Punisher and the Skill Haste which we all know Skill Haste is very finicky and only provide a return when it reaches a certain percentage.</TEXT>

    <TITLE>A Few Things About Burning Ambition</TITLE>
    <DATE>2020-01-01 22:48:02</DATE>
    <TEXT>Well I #8217;ve played around with Burning Ambition and these are my findings (some are more obvious than the others): 1. The Damage of Burning Ambition is set at the time when you applied the buff to the boss and not when it #8217;s dispelled. So if you put BA on the boss before break and then dispel it on break, it #8217;ll do the damage of before the break. Same is true if you apply it on break and dispel it outside break. 2. Despite the good looking exploding particle, it is not an AoE attack 3. Elegant Escort or any Burn Punisher does not interact with Burning Ambition at all [EDIT: What I mean is that BA damage would increase with Burn Punisher if foe has burn but without burn, BA does not have increase damage, thought I try this out because it #8217;s called  #8220;Burn #8221;ing Ambition] 4. Burning Ambition sticks onto the boss even if they disappear (Volk doing his teleport move) unlike debuffs 5. Buff Time abilities increase the duration of BA sticking onto the target so prints like BB will make BA stay on the boss longer 6. Burning Ambition can be applied to every enemy 7. Buffs/Debuffs/Punishers and any damage mods to Nobu all affect BA #8217;s damage but like number 1, the damage is set at cast and not at dispel. EDIT: 8. Multiple people can dispel the same BA and if the window of dispel is close together, the one BA will pop multiple times.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>It #8217;s really unfortunate because for a new mechanic, it had a lot of potential but right now, it #8217;s bad. It doesn #8217;t help that Nobunaga #8217;s damage is really bad (vs other blades/fire) at the moment as well making the new mechanic even less fun to play with as you #8217;re not rewarded for playing with something that requires a bit more skill. The stack for more damage would definitely be really cool to see. It would be even more cool to see if they changed the property of damage too like say 2 stack will turn into an AoE attack when dispelled and 3 stack will apply burn onto everyone caught in the AoE damage.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Yep, correct. If the enemy has burn, you have EE and you apply BA, BA will have the increased damage from Burn Punisher when casting S1. If you are dispelling and the foe has burn, your S2 or FS will have increased damage when dispelling it thanks to burn punisher but the BA that was already applied would not change at that point.</TEXT>

    <TITLE>Skill Haste for Nobunaga feels good</TITLE>
    <DATE>2020-01-04 18:45:47</DATE>
    <TEXT>So her S1 takes a bit to charge which makes her kit feel slow and clunky in a way but with Skill Haste. HER S1 feels really good to use. 0% Skill Haste = 5cfsf + 5cfsf + 3c to full charge 6-8% Skill Haste = 5cfsf + 5cFS to full charge 14% Skill Haste = 5fsf + 5c to full charge So i say it #8217;s best to run 6-8% skill haste either from HoH or from UBOV/JotS would be perfect because in a perfect world, you can keep applying S1 and dispel it at the end of your natural combo to dispel it and then immediately reapply another BA and repeat. -EDIT- I #8217;ve played around with her some more and she definitely perks to each step of the Skill Haste. 0% can actually go like this: 5cFS x2 to full charge The great thing about the 0% is that you #8217;ll meet the 15combo requirement with 5cFS + S1 since 5cFS is 7 combo each and S1 is 1 hit which grants a total of 15 hits so you can then FS immediately on just repeat the above combo to pop. The ones with skill haste though will definitely be better elsewhere like DPS and SP gains for other skills.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I tried that and even with bow co-ab (combined with 14% Skill Haste from prints). In terms of damage, F amp;H doesn #8217;t offer enough since it #8217;s missing the Str that UBOV gives and FS haste either doesn #8217;t benefit much at all at the end of your combos or it will mess your rhythm if you use it early in the combo In terms of rhythm, it depends on where you use your FS but if you don #8217;t want to mess up the rhythm, it #8217;s best to use it at the end. Bow coab doesn #8217;t feel good at all for the skill haste, it becomes like 5cfsf + 3c or something which feels very off. I #8217;ve also updated the OP where there is a really good combo string for 0% Skill Haste too</TEXT>

    <TITLE>MF + UBOV/B amp;W seems to be Nobu #8217;s Best Print Options</TITLE>
    <DATE>2020-01-04 21:45:45</DATE>
    <TEXT>I have concluded that the best prints (imo) for Nobu are: 1. MF + UBOV 2. MF + B amp;W 3. MF/HoH + EE The reasoning behind it is that depending on the skill haste, little variations can be made to rots that will give S1 every time (in a perfect punching bag world). These are: 0% Skill Haste - c5fs + c5fs 6-8% Skill Haste - c5fsF + c5fs 14% Skill Haste - c5fsF + c5 Previously I went with the go to choice of RR without much consideration but Ive thought about that with Nobu's new string, maybe she'll benefit from MF more than RR and so I've tried it on MG multiple times. MF gets me the most consistent result and seem to outdamage RR most of the time, there was 1/10 runs where RR outdamaged MF but thats the nature when you play with RNG. Now the 2nd print is depending on the situation, EE is obviously best when someone can burn but the 2nd print should either go to B amp;W or UBOV. UBOV is preferred if you want more damage and breaking isnt too important (usually suited for fights where you can only get 1 break in) and faster S2s and possibly S3 if you #8217;re not using 6* while B amp;W is suited if you want to break faster or go for that extra break (MG and Volk for example). MF = Mega Friends B amp;W = Wily Print Bubble and Wood UBOV = United by One Vision HoH = Heralds of Hinomoto EE = Elegant Escort</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Hey, you can try it out if you don #8217;t believe me, RR is not as good as MF. Punching bag MG is a good place to see that. The reason you want to use FS more often with Nobu isn #8217;t only because of the Dispel for BA but also to have a good rhythm for your S1 to full charge instead of settling with 2 and a half combo to charge S1.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>No it doesn #8217;t, it #8217;s either C5fs + c5fs or c5fsF + c5fs + c1 which I think you #8217;ll agree the latter is a very bad rhythm. I wouldn #8217;t want to go for more Flurry, you wouldn #8217;t be able to maintain Flurry (especially on HMSm and Hypnos, not so much on Volk) constantly. But say if the target is punching bag Roy, maybe it would work out since having 17% Crit rate (15 from prints and 2 from weapon type) guarantees you around 1/5 chance to Crit but Crit is a finicky thing in the end of the day.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Well you actually want to take EE for Volk due to how prominent burns are (Oofden, Xania can provide burns in the main meta picks while Rena/Aoi can provide burns in off meta pick). Nobu never really had a place as a fire blade, she #8217;s already outclassed by the previous 5* blade Rena and Aoi who is 3* can do better than her due to 70MC. Playing around with NYB on punchbag Roy, the damage is much more comparable to MF+B amp;W. The damage would #8217;ve probably went to MF+ NYB if B amp;W didn #8217;t manage to break Roy again at the last 5 seconds which gave a lot of free damage. HoH + NYB seem to perform the worst out of all the combination. Well i can #8217;t call these accurate tests since I #8217;ve only repeated like 3-4 times at most for each setup and to get an answer as conclusive as possible, you would need to perform more than that.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Rena is a different case altogether though, she has built in Crit rate and built in Crit damage in her kit so she would benefit immensely if she takes advantage of those stats. Nobunaga don #8217;t have either though and a total of 10% Crit wouldn #8217;t her her much at all. Anyway, I invite you to just test out the results yourself and let you formulate your own opinion. I #8217;m simply providing an alternative.</TEXT>

Playing with RNG and small window for stun at Pestilent Wind 3. Dealing a HUGE amount of damage before he uses Imminent (Poison Puddle at Fog) or else the team is dead (hence Freyja heals) which was the biggest run killer 4. Playing P2 at fog phase is painful especially right after P2 explosion damage 5. Gale where you have to enter into the fog and dodge reds at the same time which is the 2nd biggest run killer After probably 4-6hrs of pain and suffering, we finally did it but the time wasn #8217;t that good but due to how much we #8217;ve suffered, I thought I #8217;d post it anyway and let you see Pseudo Master Mode Expert Volk.</TEXT>

Drop 4th cano behind HBH so her back flap doesnt cause a problem for the team 3. Whoever have Siren needs to tank stack damage after Muspelheim (And the Marti if there is no Siren) 4. Please do not drop canoes right on HBH, that causes warping like crazy.  #8203; \- HMC 1. For the bubbles all over the field, dont go popping them if you're melee, pop only the three close to HMC on top-left corner 2. Bubble 2 is for Victor, dont go into Victor's bubble if you're not Victor... 3. Bubble 1 is for Zephyr Welly and Bubble 3 is for Vayu Welly 4. If both Welly are using the same dragon, then the stronger Welly goes into Bubble 3  #8203; \- HJP 1. As P4 Gleo, please dont make a wall of barrage east-side just before HJP bait, the Audric needs to wait and the bait could potentially go to someone else  #8203; \- HZD 1. If it is a double Goofden room, please let the higher might Goof hug HZD at first cage (if you have a lower might but stronger Str, you are clearly using the wrong print).  #8203; \- Volk 1. Please check your surrounding before popping an orb. Dont unga bunga all your orbs without a care of who is around. 2.

    <TITLE>SPOILER: Year of the Ox for Hinomoto 2021</TITLE>
    <DATE>2020-01-14 11:35:58</DATE>
    <TEXT>At the end of the Epilogue, we saw a meeting between all the wyrmclan leaders minus Nobu and Mitsu. There is a servant speaking in the scene and the servant says that the Ox leader is missing and that there is a possible case of foul play. We know that the Ox Leader #8217;s name is Seimei which is likely derived from Abe No Seimei. Reading the legend/history of Abe No Seimei, Seimei was a genius exorcist that learned his exorcism from China and he had a rival/nemesis named Ashiya Doman who not only NTRed him, but also murdered him. We know that all the Hinomoto adventurer/dragons does have their lore loosely tied or retain some element to whoever they are named like Mitsuhide #8217;s conniving plots or Nobu #8217;s ambition to unite all of Hinomoto so with this logic in mind, it is likely that IF Seimei was taken out (and not just taking a stroll in Qilin or Taiwu which are the land where Chinese named adventurers are from), it will likely be sabotaged by the Wyrmclan leader with the name Ashiya Doman. Now who is Ashiya Doman? Well we now saw a total of 6 Wyrmclan leaders total but three of whom we do not know what zodiac animal they represent or their names for that matter. We saw Ieyasu who was likely there to let clue us in that the next 3 shown after are also Wyrmclan leaders. We then see 3 more characters, first being either a boy or a girl with 2 different coloured hair, the 2nd being a light haired coloured girl with red eyes and the final is a giant bearded man. The first one is likely based on the rooster due to the dark coloured hair fluff, the crimsoned eye girl is likely based on a rabbit due to the white coloured hair representing the white rabbit fur and the crimson red eye which is a very iconic rabbit look especially in China. The final one is likely the dragon zodiac due to his horns and his beard design which are typical ways people tend to draw Chinese dragons (look at Peng Lai). If I have to guess which of the three shown is Doman, I #8217;ll have to say that he is mountain sized bearded man as he #8217;s the only one who looks villainous enough to fit the persona of Doman who is a bitter, hateful man. If I have to say someone outside though, it #8217;ll likely be the goat leader who is at the opposite end of the zodiac wheel to the Ox much like the horse is for the rat for this year #8217;s zodiac. Well this is all just theory and we #8217;ll likely not get the sequel until 2021 NYE.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Yea, it #8217;s really hard to find the life story of Abe No Seimei, Wikipedia is surprisingly light on any details and most website seem to like to talk about his mother being a Kitsune which is obviously fiction too. Finding more materials, some of it say that Seimei learned his spells from a book called  #8220;Hoki Naiden #8221; which belonged to Saint Hokudo who lived in Tang, China before the book made its way to Kibi no Makibi who was travelling around China. Kibi no Makibi would later return to Japan where he gives Seimei #8217;s family the book and eventually Seimei come into possession of the book.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Good run. If I could give you an advice, I would suggest trying force strike fail to speed up your rotations so not only would you enhance your Noelle gameplay but all your wand adventurers too. Overall though, you did well as Noelle.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>No and these are the reason why. 1. You don #8217;t earn max reward. This might not be a problem for those who just want a clear but for farmers etc, it #8217;s a big issue. 2. Wasting your only revive to something that we already know how to get around. 3. Depending on the amount of Bridal Dragon (TBD) equipped, it will demand the 4 Gleo to have really good rotations that is on the level of DPSdric runs which makes it significantly harder. 4. Having 4 TBD makes the run almost as fast as a Roachdric run so why bother at this point for less reward + less margin for error because you #8217;ve wasted a revive. 5. Audric is a free adventurer and cheap to build while Gleo requires full investment and gacha luck to pull. 6. Roachdric just makes the battle so much easier because he #8217;s clearly the baiter, allows for Dgauge to fill up faster and bypass opening + EB easier (other than the stun RNG chance). So overall, it #8217;s harder to play 4 Gleo if you want a fast run that is is around 10-20sec faster than DPSdric run from what I #8217;ve heard and it #8217;s still harder if you are playing it safer with 3-4 TBD vs Roachdric Run.</TEXT>

    <TITLE>6 Advance Blade Techniques</TITLE>
    <DATE>2020-01-28 14:11:51</DATE>
    <TEXT>https://streamable.com/y94uv So I #8217;m a blade main and would always use a blade adventurer if I can and while I did know that a lot of people love blades as well, what I didnt know was that some people didnt know about these hidden tricks of blades so I #8217;ve decided to share my knowledge and hopefully make more people more interested in the potential of blade adventurers. So at the very top is a link With a video I #8217;ve made containing 6 techniques that you might or might not know and I #8217;ll explain how to do each one and provide some scenario you would use them in. I would explain it in the vid if I have advance video editing skills but sadly I do not. ------------------------- 1 . Force Strike Fail - Use it on HMC, HZD and Volk while they is standing still The first technique is very common but very crucial nonetheless. There are multiple ways to cancel the end lag of your combo so you can increase your DPS uptime such as roll cancel and using skill but for fsf, you simply need to hold the screen for a split second and let go before your FS fully charge in order to cancel the end lag after c5. As a blade though, don #8217;t fsf immediately at the start of C5, sometimes you can see the blade adventurer do the spin but the hit box didn #8217;t connect so you wasted DPS uptime for an incomplete c5. 2 . Force Strike Reposition - Into Bubble 1/2 at HMC - Whirlpools in mHMC - Between the red lines in eVolk This is another very common technique but a very cool skill to have if you can master it properly. If you can master the force strike like in the video, you #8217;ll be able to attack HMC and quickly get into a bubble safely. This also allow you to continue a run as well when someone who #8217;s not sure of the battle took your bubble, your force strike can cover the distance easily and go into the other bubbles (as long as bubble 1 and 2 is not taken). I guess the best thing about this is that you look really cool especially Victor into Bubble~ 3 . Charged C5 - When Rending Blast with no Storm Strike Follow Up in mHMS is placed in a way where you are safe on the spot you are standing at C4 but not if you C5 immediately - eVolk just as he appears after 4x teleport Everyone probably knows this as well but it is very underused due to the usual bad DPS uptime due to how long it takes to charge but it #8217;s use is very good in areas applicable due to the extra damage and high SP charge. To do this, simply stop tapping after C4, wait for a spark on your adventurer and then press the screen again. 4 . C5 Redirection - Blade Adventurer trying to not take bait in HMS - When eVolk is walking towards the center before the ailment bombs - Blades trying to reposition around HDT without rolling (behind HMC for example) This one has a lot of use but it #8217;s very hard to perform. This allows the Ramona/Rena combo in HMS to work together more fluently (provided the Rena knows how to do this properly) as you can fsf afterwards and still maintain your distance instead of rolling to reposition. The time saved may be minimal but it definitely increases your DPS uptime nonetheless. To do this, you need to perform C4 combo, as the blade hops back, swipe in the direction you want to go in for C5 and then tap the screen again to perform the new redirected C5. Swipe a second too fast at C4 and you #8217;ll do a roll instead, swipe a second to slow or too long and you #8217;ll roll instead. 5 . C4 Hop Back Dodge - HMS jump back or dashes This one is very easy to do but the success rate (for me at least) is too low for you to really want to implement it as a strategy but if you can use this successfully easily, more power to you. The hop back at C4 actually lifts your adventurer into the air a small bit, making the adventurer able to jump over certain attacks. To do this, simply time your C4 with an attack with low hit box so you can jump over it. 6 . C5 KnockBack Immunity - HMS jump back and dashes - HDT Opening Blast - eVolk P2 Opening Blast This is a very easy to use technique as well and is sort of similar to number 5 but easier to apply due to the fact that Charged C5 has the immunity as well. Usually this is best used in small attacks that will otherwise give you a little knockback. You can use it on HDT opening as well but holding FS is much easier to do with just about the same benefits. To do this, simply time C5 #8217;s forward spin with a non-purple attack or an attack that you have the ailment Res to and you should be fine. ------------------------- This is it for the advance blade techniques that I know of. A lot of them are very situation but they all have their use somewhere and will definitely increase your DPS uptime if applied properly. I hope you enjoyed the short video I made and the read in this post and have fun with the blade adventurer #8217;s flexible combo.</TEXT>

    <TITLE>4 Advance Wand Techniques</TITLE>
    <DATE>2020-01-30 13:01:09</DATE>
    <TEXT>https://streamable.com/9bez0 For those who missed the Advance Blade Techniques, https://www.reddit.com/r/DragaliaLost/comments/ev62u6/6_advance_blade_techniques/?utm_source=share amp;utm_medium=ios_app amp;utm_name=iossmf So here #8217;s another few tips for a different weapon type for those that want to take their skills further. There is a video link at the very top and I #8217;ll explain each and provide a scenario where you would use those techniques. Unfortunately my video editing skills did not improve between the blade video and this one. ------------------------- 1 . Force Strike Fail - Use it pretty much everywhere The first technique is very common but it is a must. This FSf significantly reduces the end lag at the end of C5 which would equate to more DPS Uptime and faster SP gains which is the bread and butter for Wands. What makes this FSf different from other weapons is that there is an optimal way to do it and a not so optimal way to do it. At the start of C5, you #8217;ll see a flash which I use it as an indicator of when to start holding the screen at that moment for a split second to a second at most. That should make your wand adventurer to briefly go into FS and then out. You #8217;ve hold it for to long if you see the FS starts to load up, I say at most you should only see a flash of the the aiming reticle. 2 . FS Snipe - eVolk appearance after 4x teleport - sVolk appearance after Pestilent Wind - mHBH dives This one looks simple but it can be really hard to adjust to at first. What makes this FS different from the usual FS is that you actually need to manually aim as opposed to letting the FS appear on top of the target normally. Usually the FS Snipe is best followed up with a skill or roll to kill the end lag of the FS but normal combo follow up is acceptable too. Too do this, simply hold your screen to charge up the force strike, while it is charging, move the reticle to where the boss would appear. 3 . C5 Redirection - Boss dashes (HMS, HZD, eVolk Beast Form etc) - Changing targets (HMS Golems, The Wolves in Volk) This is a technique that redirects the smaller projectiles from C5 to the direction you are rolling. It is the hardest to perform in this list and it is very situational where the stars need to align in order to pull it off but nonetheless, it is a great technique to increase SP/DPS when pulled off correctly. To do this, you need to roll as you shoot your C5 but the timing you do the roll will determine the results. Roll too fast and you cancel your C5, roll just right and you redirect all 4 smaller projectiles, roll a bit slow and you #8217;ll only redirect 2 of the smaller projectiles, roll too slow and you be doing a roll cancel to reduce end lag instead. 4. Close Range - Just about everywhere This is the easiest to perform but you #8217;ll put yourself at a bit of danger depending on the boss. If you notice the video before  #8220;vs #8221;, you #8217;ll see my S1 charged faster which allowed me to use it immediately and therefore killed the end lag of my combo. While the video that is after  #8220;vs #8221;, the skill didn #8217;t charge as fast after as C5 is still travelling towards the boss and so I had to fsf and had enough time to do c1 before my skill connected to allow me to use skill. C1-3 is pretty small when it comes to SP gains so getting 1 extra hit in wouldn #8217;t help me out at all and probably even lowered my DPS uptime as I need to restart the combo. To do this, simply stand close to the boss but not too close where you #8217;d steal/lose bait or be at risk of death (HMC tail swipe). 5. Far Range (Credit to BananaFrank87) - Just about everywhere Thanks to BananaFrank to bringing it my attention. Far range also have benefits where you your skill fully charge by S2-4. Instead of using the skill straight away, continue to C5 and quickly use the loaded up skill as soon as you shoot C5. If done correctly, the skill you just used should have SP gains thanks to the C5 taking it #8217;s time to travel to the enemy. ------------------------- That #8217;s all the advance wand techniques i know of. 1 will definitely be very important while 2 and 4 will have their place of regular use. Number 3 is very situational and will require prior knowledge of the fight + perfect timing of the combo but it should have its use nonetheless. This or one other weapon (the lance) will probably be the last video I make for advance weapon techniques since I don #8217;t play the other weapon types enough to know them and if I make a video for them, it feels insulting to the players who do actually know how to play them. Hopefully you enjoyed the video and the read. Have fun trying out these techniques if you haven #8217;t done so already.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>It actually shows the Fsf just a tiny bit faster and her FSf can actually be improved further (not saying they are bad, they are good fsf. It #8217;s just that the time can be cut even further to make the difference vs roll cancel even bigger). Roll cancel is definitely beneficial in areas where you need to reposition.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>It's when you are using a Force Strike but you dont fully charge it so nothing happens when you let go. This significantly reduces combo end lag. It's similar to L-canceling in Smash Bros games.</TEXT>

    <TITLE>Before you downvote me for my opinion, I just want to discuss about the difficulty (or lack of) of the game at the moment</TITLE>
    <DATE>2020-02-10 16:08:23</DATE>
    <TEXT>I might very well be in the minority here but I feel like the game is severely lacking in difficulty at the moment. The game has the making to be a technical game (at least more technical than Warriors Games) but the problem holding it back is that it #8217;s a mobile game trying to appeal to the mobile audience who wants an auto button to go through everything but the game can be fun when you need to play technical. Now this is probably the part where I get downvoted but I thought Chronos Nyx and the mHDTs were fun. Frustrating? Yes it was but it felt rewarding for the clears. Volk release and the later Omega raids have all been a bit too easy on the technical side. Volk can be hard at first if you don #8217;t meet the DPS check but once you can get pass that, he #8217;s literally a bullet sponge boss after Phase 1. Nyx requires you to have precise movements, dodging the combos of attacks and also a strategy to counter firestorm and that goes for every HDT as well. I know those fights can be frustrating at times but I think that #8217;s the purpose of those fights, they were kind of designed to be cleared only 3 times a week only (I blame Okada for making these fights a necessary path to gain more power). Now the difficulties for the fights are too easy, you bring anything and you can clear. Back then when Astral Raids and Nightmare difficulty first existed, you need specific strategies like bringing DPrep into the fight and you actually had to pay attention and you #8217;d want to destroy certain body parts to make the fight easier (Valfarre Cross Slash and Sabnock punches anyone?). Now I dread at these fights not because they are hard but because I need to sit through these easy fights without an auto button. I guess the problem with the game atm is that the weapon power jump cause too much of a difference in power that it #8217;s separating the beginners, mid-progress players and the endgame players. Back then endgame players power difference from a mid-progress are the 5t3 vs 4t3/5t2, now it #8217;s like CT2 vs 6* MUB. I want difficult fights again but I get that not everyone have the patience or time to learn them but this game feels very unrewarding to play at this current stage because there is no more strategy to do anything, you can face tank all of Fatalis attacks and call it a day. So thank you for coming to my TED Talk and I hope you enjoyed reading a minority #8217;s opinion regarding the current state of the game.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I really think they should make a fight that is super hard and the only reward is a title like the Ultimate Hero Title. That would be dope enough for us endgame players to feel a challenge but not be so important that any players lower that can #8217;t complete it feel like they got ripped off.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I think mHDT difficulty is fine, I do see the problem of locking hard progression behind those fights though. If this mHDT only gives you alternate options to your build like say High Dragons as dragons, the faf statue, maybe an adventurer based on the dragons which is a slight variation of other adventurers like Botan, Howen, Celly etc and alternate prints that are welfare/F2p options for those who don #8217;t want to shell out water for a MUB RR for example. Overall, I think the fights are fine, just the progression behind it was not good.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I know I #8217;m at the furthest endgame hence I know my opinion is in the minority. When I am playing all the MH event, I literally just leave my lead in the middle and let the 3 AI take care of the bosses due to how easy it is (even the omega). I wish they made more dragons/faf statues to grind for instead of that weapon power jump. Regarding Omega Raids, Ebisu was the one before that and that was probably even easier tbh.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I definitely can agree to that, I wouldn #8217;t mind if a super hard fight that is specific tailored towards endgame only that earns you nothing but a title like Ultimate Hero. As of this moment, I want to equip that title but it #8217;s so easy to get it that it feels like it #8217;s not cool so I just went with Space-Time Defier instead.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I #8217;ve done meme runs as a Phoenix Koto, Laxi PUG run, Laxi+Megaman+ Aurien run, burnless double Nobunaga runs and triple 8k Zerker all with 0UB DKR runs. I #8217;ve also done a run where I had to dodge Squall, red lines and fog still active in a run (it was very exhilarating due to the immensely tight DPS check and the fact I had to dodge 2 things blind which could potentially end the run). I think this qualifies me on having done runs that are basically considered 3 man runs with such handicaps but now that you asked for a 3 man run, I think I #8217;ll do just that since it sounds interesting enough. I #8217;ve already have enough tails to make another HDT2 weapons on the get-go (I already have a MUB T2 for each element) and regarding horns, I have over a hundred horns for each element some are even at 150 count and I #8217;m one of the players on the lower side. I know one player who has 600 HJP horns for some reason... I don #8217;t have all MUB 6* but I have 6/8 only missing staff and lance since healers and Emma don #8217;t need MUB 6* so there #8217;s that. The entire game is easy and I #8217;ve stated that this is my opinion and I get that not everybody will share the same sentiment. Once again, thank you for attending to my TED Talks ;)</TEXT>

    <TEXT>It #8217;s fine that you disagree and I know my opinion is not popular but I think every player should think the game is rewarding/engaging but as of the current state, it is not for me. I think the best way to counter my problem is if the game change Omega Raids into a Title Only reward fight or even a weapon with 1 might for example just for the skin purpose. This way they can give players a meaningful reward (bragging right in this case) but it won #8217;t be so impactful that players can #8217;t beat it will feel like they got left out from something that will impact progression.</TEXT>

Usually takes 1 or 2 tries with lobbies and I can get a clear (night requirement is sky high though, I set it 9.6k min for Xania, 9.8k min for Euden and 9.9k min for Eze). mHDT not so much and the quality of HDT seems to be getting worse (probably because of the FC Bonus).</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Should #8217;ve left out the best light dragon since he is outclassed by not only Corsaint, but also by Daiko. His only saving grace is his skill to heal but that doesn #8217;t mean he #8217;s not mediocre unless we are treating Zeph #8217;s stun making him the best wind dragon too then. Other than that nitpick, it #8217;s a funny post.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>People will find different strategies if one doesn #8217;t work. This is how the beauty of Audric Gleo and Delphi Gleo strat was born. Speaking of HZD strategy not working, the fastest HZD clear is a Nessa + Malora + Gluca + Mitsu. Goof was nowhere to be found and it was still perfectly viable. So it #8217;s fair to say that it #8217;s doable without Goof as well. HMC is doable without stun but truth is every body wants to have that Zeph stun much like everybody wants that Cupid heal. This also applies true to everybody wants that Arctos dropkick stun in pre 70MC HMS meta. He is outclassed, but the thing Cupid has going is a good niche that has kept him still relevant to today.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Other than Faf lv50+, there isn #8217;t any real content where para res matters though so talking about anything outside of HZD and Faf is pretty useless. There #8217;s also the fact that Corsant has the third highest DPS vs all the other dragons only falling behind Leviathan and Daiko. As unreliable Daikokuten may be for other weapon users, they would still prefer Daiko than Cupid if they can maintain the combo (so pretty much all raids except Hypnos).</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Like I said, he has a niche that keeps him relevant and that #8217;s the beauty of the dragon meta, usually if they have a good niche, they are somhow still kept relevant. Look at Zeph, easily the most agreeable that he #8217;s the worst 60% Str Dragon due to his janky hitbox, low damage mods and long skill animation that also deals low damage and it #8217;s agreed he #8217;s outclassed easily but hey, it #8217;s because he has a stun that it still kept him relevant.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Way too much Skill Haste in the kit. Looking at your video, you got consistent S2 around 10sec if you #8217;re using S1 as well while her poison ticks are 15sec long so you definitely have more than enough time to build up next poison unless there are moments like waterfall. I would think a build like this would work better: - Long Long/Vayu - KFM - A Dog #8217;s Day (for support) - Fires of Hate (for damage) I #8217;ve played with Vanessa #8217;s S2 with A Dog #8217;s Day only for Skill Haste and it takes roughly 14sec to fully load her S2 which is roughly 500 more SP vs Velody. Velody actually does good damage with her S1 doing 834% damage and her S2 doing 995% damage total which she would definitely benefit a lot from SD prints like KFM. Speaking of KFM, her weapon type gives her 4% crit rate, with KFM, it #8217;s 18% Crit Rate which means she can put her coab which gives 30% Crit Dam to use. If you have a Xaindeer ally as well, oh boy that Crit... She should be out damaging the Welly but with a build that focus entirely on skill haste only where it #8217;s one of the worst stats unless you hit a breakpoint, it #8217;s no wonder the clear was much slower.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>If Addis use poison, he loses out on his own DPS since he #8217;ll miss out on bleed damage, bleed punisher and S2 #8217;s 25% Str buff but in return, he #8217;ll increase his team #8217;s DPS if they equipped a poison punisher print. In order to strike that perfect balance, it #8217;ll probably need to be on a rots of 1 poison, 2 bleeds and repeat but even then your poison uptime wouldn #8217;t be 100%.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Not going to work imo, Addis and Vic #8217;s bleed will clash and you #8217;ll lose DPS when you bring more than 1 bleeder since majority of their damage comes from bleed and you can only have 3 stacks at a time. If Addis solely use poison, it #8217;ll clash with Joachim and you #8217;ll likely run out of poison by 2-3min Mark. If Addis mix in both, you #8217;ll be playing very awkwardly to keep an eye on the bleed and poison stack and probably mess up your own rots in return and in the end, lose DPS. Pazuzu should be the better dragon in aura especially if poison uptime is close to 100% but in dragon form DPS, not very much.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I think it can definitely be optimised a lot. Maintaining combo as lance isn #8217;t hard since rolling wouldn #8217;t destroy your combo count, the problem is SP gains. You keep doing c2FS which imo isn #8217;t good for your rots. Your biggest SP gains are from C5 followed by FS next I believes. Usually the optimal combo is c5FS which gives you the best damage and best SP gains.</TEXT>

HBH is actually the easiest one, HMC is next with the constant prison and whirlpool, HMS followed that RNG between gale 2 and 3 (the video for that didn #8217;t show it unfortunately due to how OP 70mc is so I might revisit it with Ramona+Rena combo), the 2nd hardest is HJP using constant Electron Burst + Everlasting Blitz per minute and finally, the hardest one which I #8217;m still scratching my head to do is HZD due to him going to RNG for stacks or breath during lantern phase WITH poison spits (so 3 things at the same time).</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Cygames don #8217;t really think things through when they implement something, they always just go with bandaid after bandaid. With the mentor bonus, a lot of players are now stuck in Expert limbo because they shifted too fast from standard to expert. This wouldn #8217;t be an issue if they also didn #8217;t get a quick expert clear too which probably gave the first clearer a false impression of the HDT trials being easy cheese/no effort content again when in reality it #8217;s vets from masters carrying them. So now we have a bunch of players in expert pool who doesn #8217;t even know how to dodge hellfire properly mixed in with players who knows how to play HDT but struggle probably due to low might and no one is going to carry any of them since there is no incentive to do so after Mentor Bonus is gone. Cygames really messes up on that front, what they should #8217;ve done is each newbie account can allow FC bonus reward redeemed 10 times and then for every fortnight/month the account can #8217;t clear standard/expert HDT (and that they #8217;ve never cleared mHDT before), they get the FC status again. Yes, it #8217;s abusable but it certainly beats whatever shitshow we have in expert pub right now.</TEXT>

    <DATE>2020-02-27 04:54:50</DATE>
    <TEXT>This is my opinion: yes mentor system is flawed and can be implemented better, but during this moment, we can only work with what we got so I highly suggest those who want to learn the fight to actively quit when dying to learn the fight. Complaining will get you nowhere atm unfortunately so this is the best solution I can offer. As a mentor, I will continue carrying those fc past the finish line even if they die and use up all their lives 30s into the fight. But during this time, try to absorb all the knowledge to see how the players go through certain situations in the fight which is another way you can learn the fight because once that mentor bonus is gone, RIP. Peace out DL gamers and good luck on your endeavor to HDT/Agito.</TEXT>

I have MUB 6* and lv5 tree. The other Gleo have MUB T2 and lv6 tree. The Cleo have a lv3 tree. Our rots were extremely messy but for 3rd attempt at this, I say it #8217;s good enough.

    <TEXT>I thought it was this too at first while doing the run but then it turned out not be the case. The shield revived was the very first shield in P2 which he doesn #8217;t have any other buffs at the time. I thought maybe I #8217;ve accidentally applied Burning Ambition on him beforehand so I #8217;ve held it back and not applied S1 until I broke his shield first and then use it but that #8217;s when we see the shield came back. It #8217;s an annoying bug but i can see how it slipped though the cracks since it seems to only work when you put a buff on the boss which only Nobu can do and no one expects anyone to bring Nobu into the battle lol.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Third hit is fine, c3fs has the best flow, c4 is the problem or maybe c5. Imagine if C5 makes you strikes down immediately no matter at what point you are at c4 height.

    <TEXT>With all the new characters playing differently like Valerio, Mitsuba and the MH with their FS. I think it #8217;ll be cool to see new adventurers to have different combo strings now. Now I don #8217;t mean all new adventurers are going to have their own unique combo, I mean like each weapon type will have set A (what we have now) and set B (whatever the new string will be). So imagine if new wands play like Megaman (not the skills part) or new blades will have one of Valerio #8217;s stance only etc. I think this will freshen up gameplay while not make it overly complicated with more weapons to build.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Hey, Im glad you are enjoying this new difficulty (or lack-of difficulty I should say) it seems like you are over-joyed of being able to complete a content that you dont even know what is skills anymore. You seem to have mistaken eKai require skills just because you can unga bunga your way through while you think you mHDT lack skills just because you cant clear.  #8203; Volk still had some semblance of skills in that you should avoid getting hit by plague but you just need to roll around. eKai's only skill is dont stand between 2 rings and get ping ponged to death and MAYYYYBE Gleo holding S1 while the buff spheres are still invincible. In HDT, there are a lot of things that require skills especially when timer was still 5 minutes. For one thing, you need to optimise combo to the point that you can clear in the 5min, the other thing is not to get hit at all so you actually learn to dodge everything but let's see what each HDT have to offer:  #8203; HMS - Playing as a Sleep res character, avoid getting hit by anything even the non-telegraphed dash so you dont get stunned. Youll also learn how to bait properly as melee where you need to bait away from your team and not to your team. HBH - It was HBH that taught us how to place in game objects properly and how to do precise movements in meteor + X Muspelheim in order to live. HMC - This is where Noelles learn how to run around dodging everything like a bullet hell pro. Then there is Victor knowing when to use what skills at what moment (S2 before Aqua Spheres and S3 for rats). HJP - Taught us spacing and synchronising for the Gleos to maximise damage. HZD - Taught us teamwork I guess, in pub hell lol. Still a skill nonetheless.  #8203; I just find it very jarring that you deem eAgito requires skills because you can be clear it while mHDT have no skills because you cant clear it. When did the definition of skills become you can get hit a thousand times and still get a clear because the boss is forgiving. When did memorizing less things (eKai) equates to having skills vs HDT (eKai is still a memorization game but less punishing)?</TEXT>

    <TITLE>Why am I seeing a lot of Patia comps lately in eKai?</TITLE>
    <DATE>2020-03-11 00:18:30</DATE>
    <TEXT>They are a lot slower than 4DPS comps or even Cleo comps by at least 30 seconds and the team comp is the least flexible. Everyone always raved about how they wanted more adventurers to be playable but yet, everyone flocks over to Patia comp which must have 2 Patias + 1 Nef as opposed to 4DPS comp being Nef + whatever and Cleo comp which is Cleo + whatever. The only thing Patia comps are good for is being 100% braindead when playing but this ties back to the post saying eKai needs "skills". Do you really feel like it need skills when you are in Patia comps?</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I don #8217;t know... Nintendo is very predatory in my eyes, they all have subscription models for some reason except Dr Mario I think (decent game from what I remember). I can #8217;t remember AC Pocket Camp much since launch was lackluster but I heard they started a subscription later on. Mario Kart literally stumps your progression if you don #8217;t pay up for their subscription. The merging is bloody high as well so good luck getting max power for your favourite 5*. Then there is FEH and Pok #233;mon Masters. Pok #233;mon Masters monetary schemes are some of the worst and then FEH, ayragate and FEH pass anyone? And now to the pricing of their premium pricing, 20 orbs in FEH which is equivalent to around 5 summons cost around $60 AUD iirc which is insanely high as you #8217;re $10 off from buying a brand new retail Switch game for that amount. People also complained about DL #8217;s diamentium costing too much as well when the game first launched.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I doubt Future Agito bosses will be hard. Both Agito P2 form are easy as in its very straight forward so it really boils down to P1 form. Volk was hard due to the PVP orbs and the plague mechanic. Kai P1 actually have a very interesting phase as well if it goes beyond 3min. There will be one point where he puts the yellow ring on everyone and you all have to take a corner each so then when he does his cone slam, you wouldn #8217;t overlap each other. There #8217;s another point where he traps everyone with yellow rings again and this time he will spin towards the closest person which you either need to iframe, dtank or run really far from his initial spin spot before the cage is set. Too bad you don #8217;t ever get to see these because first phase only takes like 10sec. Moving onto other elements, the problem with wind is Hawk, high burst power with stun. Phase 1 will likely be a joke in Water Agito. Dark Agito is a mixup, it could be potentially hard or potentially easy due to Geuden. Finally we have fire Agito which looks very promising to be hard due to it being 2 bosses and that water have always been the weakest, so this one have the best potential to be at least as hard as Volk.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I believe in reddit to know what I mean but for future reference, I will spell out every word if that #8217;s what the people wish for. I prefer people not to run HDT Print and go full dps since that is what optimal but if they don #8217;t want to go full dps, at least equip the right HDT print, not Glorious Tempest in HZD... I don #8217;t mind carrying people, go to maincord, I #8217;ve carried like 90% of the people there but the issue lies in those who are  #8220;mentors #8221; themselves (they have experience mentor title) and yet a mentee plays way better than them. That is just so laughably bad... Yes, I want the wyrmites and so do those  #8220;mentors #8221;, so am I asking for too much to ask these  #8220;mentors #8221; to at least do their fair share?</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Not really, if you do your rots perfectly, you get 3 S1 before you get your 3rd charge bar (about 2.25 of the bar filled). The problem is you #8217;re relying on your team to maintain good burn uptime, if their rots are bad, say goodbye to the affliction mods. Also a team can only have so many good burn uptime before enemy starts resisting. Break isn #8217;t necessary? you do over 1mil damage if you use it on break... not using it on break is the definition of not playing optimally.</TEXT>

Also there are optimal rots and awareness to play a decent Galex and a good Galex. An easy way to know jf youre a good Galex player or not is the true solo mHBH challenge that was making waves a bit at the time of her release. The test essentially boil down to are you able to maintain good rots and good poison uptime as well while taking full advantage of her tools like the dispel and break damage burst.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>You #8217;ll need Audric, Yasu and Geuden backline because there are pivotal parts of mHBH requiring you to dtank the attack. You #8217;ll also want to use an Elli or Patia helper that have DPrep equipped space you can tank the opening blast. For Galex, good rotations are c4FS  gt; S1  gt; c4FS  gt; S1  gt; repeat until you need to apply poison so you then use S2 instead of S1. C4FS is optimal because it provides mobility, does more damage, is faster and also shreds OD vs C5. It is mostly knowledge on how to use Galex kit to its max potential. Anyone can pick up Galex, Chrom or Granzal to play but there you can see the huge difference if you play them correctly.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I think you need to look at a casual perspective, not everyone is going to want to sit through 9 episodes of Phantom Blood which is weakest of all JoJo parts just to get to the meat. 3 is action packed and have a charm that can pull you in at first episode especially with Daisuke Ono voice acting. Part 1 however is very slow and Hamon doesn #8217;t exactly make for interesting fights. Part One is probably carried Takehito Koyasu but Part 1 Dio and Part 3 Dio are very different and I know a lot of people hated part 1 Dio because he killed Jonathan #8217;s dog. JoJo Part 1 does have a banger OP song though.</TEXT>

Then when I get the reply of being able to clear in sub 2min, I wasn #8217;t comparing it with the fastest speed clear, it was simply a comparison to the usual 3 Marth comp clears that could get just as fast and an easier setup and less risks involved.

    <TEXT>The success rate for full auto seems to be 1 in 3 games so this is not 100% unfortunately but if you #8217;re lazy like me and prefer to just press retry instead of semi-auto (and don #8217;t have Grace) this is it probably. Now to iron out some details 1. I don #8217;t think you can really sub out any of the adventurers here beside Lowen for Grace or WXania. 2. Hope needs Wish Upon A Dragonyule. HMS/minis are probably preferred but I never tried Freyja so maybe Freyja is better. I would replace QotBS with another water res print like Promise in the Rain if possible but no eldwater life here. The idea is to have Hope be as tanky as possible. 3. Lowen probably doesn #8217;t mind whatever dragon. Didn #8217;t try swapping out SR but I imagine GMYW might work. Flash and Heat is probably a bad option, should #8217;ve went with Dog #8217;s Day here. 4. Ranzal went with Summer Paladyns because as far as I #8217;m aware, he never gets frozen (I think he doesn #8217;t, I wasn #8217;t watching) and there #8217;s a lot of Def user being Hope, Ranzal, Lowen and the RNG god Sylas so energy will make good stacks to boost his S1. VC probably works too but no eldwater life here. 5. Sylas is very likely needed, his S1 Str down probably plays a very big role. If Lowen isn #8217;t being an idiot at Floor of Despair, the rebound arrow is likely going to be the run killer because Hope eating 10 arrows to the face is not going to be pretty. Time out don #8217;t seem to be an issue with this build.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Feels like it. So this Hope build is taking advantage of his double res (control Ranzal and he might get frozen which will lead to team standing behind him doing nothing other than waiting to get wiped. Control Sylas and you get bogged... not pretty). There is also how he is so useless that he is the most important one in the team. He #8217;s so useless regarding his own DPS that I #8217;m able to just give him QotBS (for water res, is go with Promise in the rain if I had that print) and Wish Upon a Dragonyule to focus on surviving and not worry about DPS dropping at all since Hope is an S1 machine. With those prints and a dragon to give him HP, a lot of times he #8217;s able to eat all the arrow rains and come out unscathed.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>You actually do want to dragon Dragon tanking and dragon claw stacking aside, you want to dragon because it #8217;s a DPS increase. It #8217;s only a loss if you stay in dragon form so you #8217;ll commonly see people go into dragon, use skill and then sacrifice the dragon to an attack so they can immediately go back to the adventurer.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I am able to make a full auto team and watch my AIs go into town with ECiella/EKai as I disengage from the game and go play another game like Super Smash. The game is more engaging than ever as well, I go to discord and see many new faces once only asking for the new full auto comp each day. Back then you would see the same few people who would post in lfg to find 3 other people who would only join up with you to just waste your time with communication and coordination when what they should #8217;ve done is just unga bunga. I can #8217;t believe Cygames once upon a time thought it was a good idea to actually make us play the game, mHDT and eVolk anyone? What were they thinking? Making us actually play the game? What dark times we lived in... I must not be the only one to think this way right? Share your story on how autoing Ciella, KY and 90% of this game made like this game more.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I do think they are the one who made the game into this. Okada is also at fault though for releasing more and more powercreep with no sense of balance. The coab+CCA change was unnecessary other than to get that whale money, same with skill share. 70mc is all over the place where you have oppressive adventurers like Hawk and then you have complete trash like Cass. We finally had some semblance of balancing when Curran, Hein and co #8217;s 70mc came out but then Cygames decide to fuck balancing and just went ahead and release Galex and Bellina. Then there is that ever so questionable atk rate+ for shadow Agito which makes you wonder what drugs Okada was on when he decided to give shadow which is already OP the most powerful Agito weapon to date. Oh and Mars, not only did they powercreep 80% Str dragon, they powercreeped it in every sense possible. Easier 90% Str condition vs Daiko, Garland, Nyarl etc. Can use 2 skills instead of 1 vs other dragons, gives 20% Str per skill use, choco effect exiting dragon, high damage and have really good frame data too. Mars isn #8217;t just the best dragon by a small scale, he is the best dragon by a huge landslide vs 2nd best dragon.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>It #8217;ll be 1 of these 2 scenarios. 1. Styx will be trash because if Eugene have SP cost that is 3.2 or under (Approx 7sec to charge), why are you waiting 1 full minute to use his S2 then? You can use 3 stacks instead for 150% SD but then you might as well just use Siren who gives 120% SD and 20% Str (non-conditional). 2. Eugene is going to be complete trash, if his S1 takes around 20sec to load up just to accomodate Styx #8217;s 1min full stack, Eugene is practically not usable. In this case, you #8217;d probably want to use Gaibne instead to speed up the amount of S1 you can pump out instead. Either way, Styx is very terrible and I would use a 3* dragon over Styx.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Ahh I remembered wrong then, 90% SD it is but even then, Siren is still way better than Styx. You are either waiting 45sec to slightly outedge Siren or you are going to be worse than Siren. If Eugene skill is accommodating to Styx, he #8217;s going to be terrible, imagine using a skill per 20sec lol. Either way, even with high S2 mods, it isn #8217;t likely going to be a game changer, we are probably looking at a glorified gala Euden kit (with a dash of Chrom elements) here. This combined with Okada #8217;s most hated element, do you honestly expect it to be any good?</TEXT>

What seem to work though is that the Yas was trigger happy on the ult so he would immediately use the ult but my ult was already on its way out by then and from what i think i saw is that it cancelled his ult.

    <TEXT>Yes, depending on who you are Laning against, consider relic shield as first item over spellthief. Comps that have lane bullies like Swain, I always go for Relic Shield since all it takes is one E from him to kill you. Vs Hook champs like Blitz, I always get boots ASAP and don #8217;t stand behind your minion wave always. Consider the upcoming wave and positioning of Blitz or the hook champs, sometimes you think you are safe behind your minion but he can just run around the minion wave and catch you and because the next minion wave is still so far away, you #8217;ll very likely get hooked when you #8217;re running back to your tower. Warding, what is your enemy jungler playing? If it #8217;s a Zac, no point warding the brush on the river, ward the tri bush, Nunu? Ward a bit deeper in the river. So you see him rolling. Evelynn? Control ward the river bush and one of the lane bush or behind them (noticed some eves like to use that to get around). Ofc those are general warding advice but you need to consider your positioning in lane as well to make the appropriate response. Ping, ping is so important and consider everyone to be blind, if you think enemy is going to mid, ping danger on their lane, not just enemy missing on your lane. See the jungler anywhere on the map? Ping the map where the jungler is or the closest lane to the enemy jungler. Ping on your way to the river when you are going to ward, some adc don #8217;t look at where you are and would try to pick fights. Ping your adc danger when you see enemy jungler coming towards you. I ping 2-3 times because people might not see the first one. Positioning in team fights, you keep yourself alive first and foremost so you can keep the team alive. Look at a team fight with and without you, when you #8217;re around, casualty tends to be low to none but when you #8217;re dead, your team tend to be wiped out too so always try to stay alive and don #8217;t try to make YouTube clips with your ult or something. If your adc gets jumped on, peel for him but if there isn #8217;t anything you can do, back off and support the others. Map awareness, the adc focus on farming and poking at laning phase while you focus on poking, warding and map awareness, this comes back to the warding advice but essentially always look at your minimap every 5-10sec because there #8217;s no point having a deep ward if you don #8217;t look at your minimap to see who is in its vision. And then this one is for me personally but maybe it affects many others too, when you give first blood or you died once, don #8217;t get tilted and don #8217;t be a hero to try to make plays to redeem yourself, just accept it and play safer and that means don #8217;t go for as many pokes or back away when things look potentially bad. Last general advice would be to take every game as a lesson, if someone calls you shit, take it and improve better from there. You are not as bad as they say you are since you are in the same elo as them but you must #8217;ve made some bad plays to warrant them calling you shit in the first place. This is a rather long post but hopefully you climb from that point. I don #8217;t know would my advice really help since you #8217;re high gold and that #8217;s pretty much low platinum (you #8217;ll see you #8217;re paired with low plat players already) which is what I am atm.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Thanks, I run inspiration in the first place because a mobafire build said to run cosmic insight and the boots rune. After climbing to silver, I noticed 12minutes for boots are taking too long especially against hook champs which is pretty important imo. That #8217;s when I decided to switch over to future market which lets me buy boots, control ward and a few faerie charm at first back easily. Alternatively I can buy a tear straight away even though I have like 600 gold only. As for cosmic insight, it #8217;s just to spam W even more easily at late game. All I do is press W at a certain point in the game. I #8217;ve never really tried other runes since it #8217;s what I #8217;m comfortable with atm but is the other ones better?</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Sometimes some situations can #8217;t be avoided but if there is 4 people camping you, you can just back away into inner tower.

There #8217;s probably a lot more issues like you making yourself an easy target to camp (meaning bad wave control), not warding properly, no map awareness or simply you overstayed your welcome when you are low health.</TEXT>

Things like runes, item pathing depending on matchup, do you roam, warding vs certain matchups (I hate anything to do with enemy shaco or eve) etc will help. Thanks in advance.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>At the moment, without canceling dragon for Gluca is 73k for Daiko and 65k for Thor so its a pretty big difference. While it assumes you never lose combo but at the same time, its not hard to regain flurry combo and most of the time considering when youre building flurry, youre probably building SP for a skill as well so the downtime is you dont get 80% str for normal combos which isnt a big deal. I dont believe in the bible but its almost 10k difference, thats pretty big...</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I don #8217;t think so. Naveed was used because of how tanky he is, how much damage he can deal now and most importantly, the dispel. The issue with the first cross gale + orb which is the run killer is because Naveed doesn #8217;t have dispel up at that point which makes that one hit extra hard. I tried with Nobunaga before Naveed and she seem like she might work, though she is squishier but at least she #8217;s easier to dispel compared to Naveed. YCass might be replaceable, I haven #8217;t tried with other healers yet though.</TEXT>

I did play around with Lucretia ACL a bit and it seems that Daiko was around 2k dps higher than Thor as well even though sims suggested to use Thor. I could have made a human error for Lucretia though but overall, Daiko is just superior. As for other adventurer #8217;s dps difference on Daiko vs Thor, I didn #8217;t test it out on the rest other than Gluca, Geuden and Lucretia.</TEXT>

Someone told me they tried Tiki and Grace but when they got to P2, global arrows killed everyone because no one prison tanked it thanks to Tiki destroying the prison. I think a consistent Etart run would get to probably 1 clear in every 5 retries maybe? Unless the next powercreep wave (or Tart bane in the future maybe?) make it that the adventurers can tank a buffed arrow from tart.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I tried swapping Agito buff to something else but it messes up Mord #8217;s opening combo that it makes him likely to get hit on first dash. Mord is mvp here and one of the many reason is because his S1 lets him dodge a lot of attacks which lets him avoid enervation as long as possible.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Yea that #8217;s the issue I face as well which is why I used Mord + Goof, it seems to have more better outcomes compared to other comps with either of these results 1. When Portal 1 opens, Goof will steal dash bait to the right while Mord is consistently on the left so Mord will walk into portal when Etart is too far 2. As you saw in the vid, Mord will have enough to S1 again and right onto the spot where Tart does arrows (tart origin point is where ever he walks from to the middle so if he walks up, the cross will be at top but since goof baited him to right earlier, he dash back to left so he will walk right in order to get to the middle). Tart will then follow up with a red dash which will usually make Goof go into a portal.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Like I said, I didn #8217;t say it #8217;s consistent clears, I said it #8217;s getting  #8220;more consistent #8221;. Etart auto clears tend to take 50-100 tries and you still won #8217;t get a clear. This comp already got me 7 clears with natural stamina which is a huge far cry from old etart auto clears. Also my main goal of posting this comp is so other people can see where the auto progress is at and maybe someone out there with a grace or more big brain than me can contribute to make it even more consistent than what it is atm.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>You clearly don #8217;t know the law... while I get that you are trying to humour that EVERETT was simply misunderstood, but the issue is that you still believe that EVERETT can #8217;t be charged. The video clearly shows that EVERETT pushing the table aside and then push both arms in an open palm fashion and not what you suggest to be grabbing and pulling to save them from a fall. There #8217;s also the fact that he made a threat before hand, while what he said won #8217;t get him charged for stalking and intimidation in crimes act, it certainly paints a picture for the magistrate to see that EVERETT had intentions to cause harm when he made contact with ROMES. Something like this will never be seen be the jury btw, Jury are only called for serious indictable offence and common assaults are dealt with summarily.</TEXT>

For those who used THope lead probably encountered THope dying to bolts numerous times because he won #8217;t move his ass when bolts rain down. Granzal is also very tanky which in a perfect situation, he can eat all bolts and live. Oh and finally, I would run Grace if I could but I do not own her so this is Graceless life auto comp but it should be very easy to make this into a Grace comp by swapping Lowen out and Granzal should be able to live everything easily then.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I haven #8217;t seen an eCiel compared that would ever use HDT2 unless it #8217;s budget option where they don #8217;t want to craft 2 of the same Agito. There #8217;s also the fact that after update, adventurer skills hit really hard and HDT skill were already pretty weak before, but then you combine it with long animation like the HDT wind Lance, and you are losing more dps.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>For Karina lead, give them synthetic dragon (5*) + beach battle (4*) for burn res affinity. Fire res print. Study Rabbit and Summer Paladyns. For Fjorm, go as much damage as you can will be nice so D amp;T, Str = 70% or full health, broken punisher or force charge maybe, frostbite punisher and something else.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Hey that #8217;s fair belief. I just want to say that most of not all HDT skill are completely useless, but while you do have some rare good ones like Wind blade but you wouldn #8217;t be using Victor or Tobi in autos mostly. There is also the Agito weapon being actually very good for autos because it gives them tankiness and proc double buff. It #8217;s just me and my opinion but I cannot ever see an HDT skill being better than the Agito skill even before the update.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Simple, if she #8217;s not contributing by being a dps then she needs to contribute elsewhere and right now it #8217;s her utility and her buffs but being a buffer is the issue (her utility is just as bad if not worse but that #8217;s for another topic), she #8217;s not doing a good job when she #8217;s the worst buffer in her element. I never said she isn #8217;t a buffer, I just said she #8217;s not a good buffer and that is a fact. To rub salt to the wound, she #8217;s a limited 5*, her competition is Melody who is a 3*, Noelle and THope who are 4* and Tobias who is 5* that comes with the elusive buff time coab. You can take her off ele but that #8217;s just worst because now she #8217;s competing against Eli and Patia.</TEXT>
