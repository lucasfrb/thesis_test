    <TEXT>i guess that depends on why you self harm. heres a list of things that help for me depending on the purpose of sh that day: 1. feeling numb. take a cold shower, roll down a grassy hill, make some tea and hold the hot mug in my hands, anything that helps me FEEL. 2. feeling angry. scream into a pillow, punch a pillow, tear paper, use a red texta to "cut" lines where i want to self harm, go running or skateboarding. 3. feeling overwhelmed and seeking relief. go upside down! i love to do handstands and headstands and find them really helpful. but i think anything that gets you moving or changes your physical environment is good. 4. feeling like i need to be punished. this is by far the hardest one to deal with and i'm still working out to cope with it. i try to journal things out. i hope that helps? and was what you were looking for? congrats on 4 years clean</TEXT>

    <TEXT>probably. i had some of a similar depth (i think) that faded within a year. do NOT get some sunburnt - this will bleach them, not fade them! use some sort of oil on them to soften them up as well, bio oil is good but a little exxy, i use the Sukin body oil which is much more affordable and works better imo</TEXT>

    <TEXT>no - to be blunt, it is not normal and it should not be normalised as a hormonal teenage girl thing. it took me a long time to realise that the way i felt and behaved was not normal. but such extreme moods are not something that everyone goes through. not everyone thinks about "the final yeet". it took me a long time to realise that some people may never experience suicidal thoughts or think about hurting themselves but once i did, things really changed. believe me when i say that not all teenage girls think like that.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>if you see beans, especially if the fat is bubbling out of the woundc it does need to be stitched. it will heal if you don't but it can take months to heal from the bottom up and cuts of that depth are really prone to infection. you don't necessarily need to go to hospital, if you have a family doctor you trust they can stitch it for you (missed the added edit after writing all that - i hope you're ok, keep us updated!)</TEXT>

    <TEXT>i'm not going to convince you that ODing is not the answer but i will let you know what happened when i ODed on my ADHD meds (i was on dexamphetamine) so you can make a more informed decision. to repeat: im not encouraging you to OD and im also not going to try and convince you not to because thats not my place and you have the right to make your own choices. ADHD meds are stimulants. most drugs which are used in OD are depressants (like alcohol, benzos and the like) which typically cause death via central nervous system depression aka you don't realise you aren't breathing. that is not the case with adhd meds. they cause death typically via cardiac arrest of some kind or hypertension or tachycardia (which is high blood pressure and high heart rate respectively). if it fails, its not pleasant. i won't specify the dose i took, but according to "minimum lethal doses" it should have killed me. it didn't- it just kept me awake for 3 days and triggered a manic episode (i have combined borderline personality disorder with bipolar). i was taken to the hospital under schedule (ie against my will) and had to be observed for 36 hours because my heart rate wouldn't come down to a normal pace. if you want to talk more about it, drop me a msg, always happy to talk x source: i study medical sciences and i have survived many suicide attempts, two of which were ODs with adhd meds</TEXT>
