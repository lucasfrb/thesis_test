    <TITLE>Moving to Japan with my wife or three years - please advise</TITLE>
    <DATE>2020-02-13 12:30:25</DATE>
    <TEXT> #8203; Hi there, I've accepted a fixed term academic research and teaching job based at a University in Tokyo, and I will be starting in July. I had a few questions, if you guys can help me that would be awesome.  #8203; 1. My wife is an artist, but she also works part time - and would like to to do so in Japan. Will she have problems getting a dependent visa to work? And if so, how many hours will be she be allowed to work. She is an EU citizen with a Master's degree. 2. My employer will provide health insurance - but I was wondering if I will be able to include her as a dependent, or will we have to get separate private insurance for her? 3. I was in Tokyo as a visiting scholar for a month in 2019, and we stayed at a University apartment. It was ok, but at Y196,000 it pe rmonth it seemed a little over-priced for the size (50 sq m2). We would probably be able to stay there again as a temp solution initially. Would it be better to do that, and look for a more permanent place when we're there - or to already start looking from here and move directly into a place. 4. What neighborhoods would you recommend? We stayed in shinjuku near the uni before, and it was cool - but I understand we'd probably have to move a bit further out if we want to have a bit more space. I think we would be fine with something in the 55 - 65 sq m range - but obviously this can get a bit expensive inside the JR line - so would be happy to move out further. I dunno how realistic this is in Tokyo - but I love cycling to work - is that possible? 5. And finally, this is a little bit of a touchy subject... although I'm very glad to have this job (especially in the current climate), it's a bit of an intimidating move since we're planning on starting a family in the next year or so. Has anybody had experience of giving birth here - and if so what was it like? We don't speak Japanese (but plan to learn) Also....we need friends! Dm me if you want to hang out.  #8203; cheers!</TEXT>

    <TITLE>Best Real Estate Agency for finding Apartments?</TITLE>
    <DATE>2020-03-03 23:39:06</DATE>
    <TEXT> #8203; Hi there, I asked some questions last time about our upcoming move, and got some great and very helpful answers . Hopefully some of you lovely people can help me out again. Will be moving to Tokyo from end of June with my wife. I have an academic job at a University in Shinjuku, and my wife is an artist - and going by some people's advice here - we think we would like to look somewhere in Koenji or Kichijoji. The annoying thing is that now my university has told me we're no longer eligible to get a temporary University Guesthouse place while we look for something more permanent. I'm gonna check out whether this is true - but if so, it will be pretty annoying. Would it be advisable to try and arrange a long term (2 years +) rental apartment before we arrive? And if so, could someone recommend an estate agent that we could use? I have a couple of friends and colleagues who speak Japanese that may be willing to view places on our behalf - but is this a really dumb idea? Also, what kind of price would it be for an apartment which is around 55 sq m - 2LDK for example - in the Koenji area? I looked on this Gaijinpot website - but I heard some people say that they're not very good and overcharge? Thanks!</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Ok, thanks - that does sound like a good idea! But I'm assuming that if it's just like a local real estate agent, they're not very likely to speak English right - so might be an idea to bring someone alone?</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I heard of this. I actually came across this: [http://www.ur-housing.com/](http://www.ur-housing.com/) Have you had any contact with this company - Whitestone. It seems a bit dodgy, but elsewhere I saw that they're actually ok.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>We were there for a month last year - so we kind of know what to expect. I think we'll be able to start looking after a few days etc. I would personally be in favour of taking something suitable - but obviously, its ultimately my wife's choice haha - and she has very specific and some times very irritating standards.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Hi there, No numbers on morphology, unfortunately. Thanks for the info, really eased my mind a little bit. Sitting in the office not being able to work at all atm. So, you don't think think we should already think about IUI or IVF or other options yet? We haven't been trying for very long - so I'm unsure if it's really even an option. Any tips on diet and vitamins?</TEXT>

    <TEXT> gt;proxceed  #8203; Ok, excellent advice - thanks mate! How's everything going with you? I might try and get this stuff from Amazon, then. I didn't realise cycling was so bad. Also, when I'm playing basketball/working out I've been wearing compression tights all the time - this has probably had a really bad effect. I also usually wear pretty tight boxer shorts, so I'm going to change this as well. Honestly, they really should tell younger guys this kind of stuff - and encourage them to get checked out. Literally nobody told me me any of this until now - and it's a bit of shock.</TEXT>

    <TEXT> gt;So you are double that because your count per ml is very high :-) Does this mean my progressive motility is technically in the normal range, if at the very minimum? Is it still going to be difficult for me to get my wife pregnant?</TEXT>
