    <TITLE>When fans eventually return to St Mary's will the club ever consider moving the away fans?</TITLE>
    <DATE>2020-07-02 19:54:33</DATE>
    <TEXT>I've always thought about this option and then coronavirus halted everything and with fans being unable to attend matches right now I've wondered why can't the club move away fans to another area of the stadium when it's safe for people to return again. I tend to sit in Northam and sometimes Itchen South and having the away fans in Northam is frustrating because all it does is drown out the noise from our most vocal supporters in Northam and Itchen North when ideally it would be better to have them merge together. In my opinion the away fans should be moved to Kingsland North (blocks 33-39) and then have the whole of the Northam stand filled with our fans. It would really improve our atmosphere at home. Does anyone else have any thoughts on this or shed any light on whether the club has ever considered this option?</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Yeah it's just a thought I've had for awhile that I haven't really seen discussed much so I thought I'd throw it out there to get some other opinions on it. I'm not expecting the club to make such a change anytime soon as I'm sure the money would be put to use on more important things. I respect your view regardless though, thanks.</TEXT>

For him to openly state he wants to leave the club while still with us to play at a "higher level" when he's a dull and average player just shows what pathetic delusions of grandeur he has. Good riddance to the arrogant prick. Absolutely delighted that we've got KWP though, he'll be such a fine addition to the team.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Uhh man I feel you there, been there plenty of times and still am a couple of times a week. What I did to help deal with this is I changed my habits after work. Instead of playing on my PS4 an hour after work, I read a book for 30 minutes or so, it helps me get to sleep quicker. Also try only playing games a few hours at the weekend only, it's what I do. As for the running try going 2-3 times a week even after a 12 hour day, eat something 30 minutes before you finish (ideally a banana) to give you a boost to do a 20-25 minute run. Always try and set a time so that you go to sleep at like 21:00 or 21:30, etc. Don't try and justify staying up a little longer when your already feeling knackered because you just regret it in the morning. Try this out if you can, it helped me out so much and I hope it can help someone else.</TEXT>

    <DATE>2020-09-02 12:13:26</DATE>
    <TEXT>I'm not currently a season ticket holder and I have not had one since the Koeman era and I'm curious to know if anyone else will feel like they'll be excluded from any priority list that will determine which fans can attend matches next season due to limited capacity. I can understand season ticket holders getting full priority over anyone else. However for those of us fans that cannot attend as many games due to pricing and other commitments, or don't have a saints membership card, etc we may struggle to buy a ticket for a game as I'm sure that the whole of next season will likely be limited capacity. I was only able to attend 8 matches last season (7 home, 1 away) but that was with full capacity, however with limited capacity I wouldn't be surprised if I can't attend a game until possibly after Christmas, who knows? Anyone else here in a similar situation or have any thoughts on this at all?</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I found in previous seasons we struggled to fill the stadium because of how expensive some games can be to attend and sometimes of how bad the performances were particularly at home. Yeah I can see how everyone will be chasing after every available ticket now. I reckon they'll only let about 5000-8000 fans into the ground to be honest.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>That would be nice if they do that. I buy tickets on general sale at the moment but if getting a membership card helps with priority in tickets then I'd gladly invest in it. Will probably see how the first few games at home with fans in it go first though. Thanks for your insight.</TEXT>
