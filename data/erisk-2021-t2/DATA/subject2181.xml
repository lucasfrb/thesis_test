    <TEXT>This is basically eastern Armenian. I understand 95%. Hamshenis of Georgia,Russia everywhere except of Turkey in my opinion is just an accent difference not an dialect.

    <TEXT> gt; rael has a similar right of return policy, except it is tied with religion. Anybody can convert to Judaism and qualify under their "right of return." Nobody can be an Armenian or apart of the Armenian nation if they aren't Christian, and from an Armenian family. You are funny. If am going to identify myself as a Turk but not willing to convert to islam, am i ever going to get married to a Turkish girl or any muslim? probably not. Atleast if you identify youself as an Armenian = christian. You will get integrated with community without obstacles. Those Turks you mentioned which are Christians are far from the "Traditional" Turks. We need to be realistic, think twice. Armenians are accepting Hamshens as they are. Do you think its Okay what Alliev is saying? Is that what a president is suppose to say in a civilized world. Ofcourse Armenians will get angry. You need to be realistic again! You are just waiting for the right moment to emptying your basket with all these nonsense.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Depends on family, but overall if you consider youself armenian engage in the community and are christian no problem. Its hard to tell what every single family and their values are, but would doubt they would reject a person according to my writing above. I had a relationship with a kurdish girl from Turkey for 7 years, it went down the toilet, because of religion. Here father could not stand a christian marry here daughter. They identify them self as kurds but 99% Turkish and islamic values. This is very common among kurds from Turkey while Kurds from Irak is completly different. Why would Armenians want them to convert back? i dont mind if they want to, but that is not a requirement. And overall i have a mixed feeling about them even recognize themself as Armenian. They are very strictly about telling they speak "Hamshen" even though that is Armenian. Maybe they are still afraid of their lives if they start to embrace their armenian identity: http://asbarez.com/168207/hamshen-couple-arrested-in-turkey-for-being-armenian/ Hamshens from Georgia or any other country have no problem calling them self Armenian but those from Turkey, still wants to separate themself for some reason. Is there any other possiblities than negotiations? War is the last thing our people want right now. What i meant with "traditional" turk is that, when people live isolated, they assimilate alot with local groups and other etnities, and can barely be compared with a turk from Turkey or any other turkic country. There values and culture is different. Its kind of obvious one or two generation in another country you become more assimilated. Hamshens is a good example also. Azeris from Iran even believe they have different mentality and mindset compared to those who live in azerbaijan, according to my friend azeri from iran. This is true also for Armenians.</TEXT>

I am talking 100 or 200 years in the future, Armenians have suffered abnormaly losses in population not only due to the Genocide but everything after that aswell. Population growth happens fast, with the right conditions. How do you think Israel manage to defend their borders? You guys need to increase your views look at the big picture. Technology is the key. We actually only need Georgia for trade (European-market), We overestimate Turkey and its market, i know its big, but if a we have a effective and easy access to the blacksea trough Georgia thats it, That should be one of Pashinyans goals. Armenia has not reached peak export to Europe not even near, and their is alot work to be done. And Iran for the asian market ofcourse.</TEXT>

    <TEXT> gt; The walls bear crosses in several places, including a [khachkar](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Khachkar) with a building inscription in Armenian on the easternmost tower, so the much repeated statement that Kars castle was built by [Ottoman](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ottoman_Empire) [Sultan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sultan) [Murad III](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Murad_III) during the war with [Persia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Persian_Empire), at the close of the sixteenth century, is inaccurate. However, Murad probably did reconstruct much of the city walls (they are similar to those that the Ottoman army constructed at [Ardahan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ardahan)). During the eighteenth century at the [Battle of Kars (1745)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_of_Kars_(1745)) a crushing defeat was inflicted upon the Ottoman army by the Persian conqueror, Nader Shah, not far from the city of Kars.  #8203; Falsification: [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Castle\_of\_Kars](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Castle_of_Kars) [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kars](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kars)  #8203;</TEXT>

What ever you find in central asia minus what they have learned from the USSR and Persians, thats your original culture. That means you barely have anything. Think logical whatever you find in turkey which is not in used in central asia means you have stolen it from the Armenians and all other ethnic groups.  #8203; Hope you can be 1 out of 80 million people which can think, and analyze logically.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>He gives a clear message to all, that the problem need to be assessed from a very low level. Pashinyan is right how could that be acceptable to work in such environment? its not only about the flag, but it creates a good headline to be used by the media. It doesnt even matter if the place was rented or not, the people is so washed with the old regime rutines and how to ignore everything.</TEXT>

    <TITLE>Xspice remote desktop for 3d games</TITLE>
    <DATE>2019-07-11 12:48:47</DATE>
    <TEXT>Hi, Have been trying to run 3d games using Xspice, inside a docker container. Everything works fine, except when i try to run games. The mouse pointer is in relative mode which is correct: meaning that am using the remote desktop mouse. Problem is that the mouse movement does not corresponding to the movement inside the game. Hard to explain but the games is uncontrollable. Basically when I start to play, it becomes "crazy" and the game is out of control. If I press "esc" the mouse works normally. Does not matter which game i try, its the same.  #8203; I have tried VNC aswell, has the same issue, but thats because it does not have support for relative mouse.  #8203; Any help please?  #8203; Edit: Take a look at the video:  #8203; [https://streamable.com/4p8bf](https://streamable.com/4p8bf)</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Agree, but thats quite difficult if you think twice what out people have gone trough the last century. Its like the phrase "been there done that" and nothing happened. Entire world was watching armenians getting slaughtered by the hands of turks. There are alot of frustration among Armenians, and frankly everyone is sick tired of this Turks. Its like bullying a child for a couple of weeks. What do you think will happen? He exploads in anger and trying find just the right moment or timing to punish his abuser.</TEXT>

Dont forget that this kind of actions are applicable to the azeris as well. But yours are quite exagerated because you only have the loss in NK-war.

If you are gonna be cut of from family because of love then its not worth it. Obviously there are culturally differences as well to consider and not only religion. I guess alot of shit will be said behind your back among the Armenian community. And if someone is prepared to handle that as well then go ahead :)</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I agree. Doesnt really matter if there are a small percentage of Turks who actually is normal and can befriend with. In the end their government is the one that makes the decisions and not the small minority of the liberal Turks. Honestly Pashinyan is the last hope for a fast recovery of Armenia and we cant afford another wave of hungry politicians eating up Armenia from the inside. For now the future looks bright and we should look forward for the next generation of development and pursue the goal to become the silicon valley of caucasus.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Those inscriptions are from 494 AD. Which means Mashtots created the Armenian alphabet almost 90 years **before** these inscriptions was made. thats why i told you to find relics, something that pre-dates Mashtots. Because now this doesnt make sense if Pharnavaz was born 300 BC and created the Georgian alphabet around that time, how come there is not a single artifact that can prove you had an alphabet pre-mashtots?

And it wont be viable especially with all those tanks and other equipment being destroyed. I feel honestly this can continue for a long time. But for how long can the azeri keep up? I mean their economy will collapse same with the Armenian. But one thing to note is the Armenians has already been there during the 90s and have felt how it feels during really bad times. Has the azeris felt the same? I dont think so. It will eventually lead to demonstrations internally. How many tanks can Turkey realy export to Azerbaijan? 50 per day? is that viable in the long run?</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Russia's largest govt-run Channel 1 outlet has a prime-time talk-show called "Time will tell", which invited Armenian, Azeri, and Russian experts for debates. Russian reporter was invited to explain the situation. He mentioned the situation in Stepanakert and how Azeris [failed to take and] damaged the northern highway connecting Armenia to Artsakh, with Turkish Bayraktar drones. Azeri Guest: how do you know Azeris used Turkish drones? Russian Reporter: these drones are made in Turkey. Russian Host: hold on. Let's assume the drones were of "unknown origin". Now let's analyze which drones they were. Russian Reporter: ... the Azeri side doesn't hide it's Turkish... Russian Host responds to Azeri Guest: here is a video [shows a Bayraktar video] published by Azeris showing the destruction of several Armenian vehicles. The footage appears to be recorded from a Turkish drone. Period. Russian Reporter continues: we visited Stepanakert and saw the outcome of the Azeri GRAD missile attack that was used against a completely peaceful civilian house. Russian Host: have you learned any info on who started this war? Russian Reporter: locals say Azerbaijan began bombing at 7:10 am yesterday. I know each side will blame the other, but I'm more concerned about civilians. I spoke with 2 Armenian kids in a bomb shelter. Their house was bombed. It's not even near any military object. Azeri guest: Pashinyan started this. He escalated the situation this year. Russian Guest enters chat: so you're telling me it's Armenians who started it, while it was Azeris who launched a partial draft ahead of time and brought reinforcements? Azeri Guest: .... because Armenians provoked Russian Guest: ... "provoked" by "using words" but they didn't open fire. [host interrupts] Russian Host to Azeri Guest: when you say Pashinyan is the one who verbally provoked, I can assure you that both sides made provocative statements, including the Turkish side. [the main theme became the Turkish involvement in the conflict. The Russian host and guests are not pleased. They blasted Erdogan's statements.] Russian Host: let's use logic about who started the war. Here is a video [of Azeri soldiers being destroyed during an unsuccessful attempt to capture northern highway through a gorge near Mrav]. Someone gave those soldiers an order to move forward. Why? Armenian Guest: obviously the order was given by the Azeri govt. It's elementary logic. Armenia has no reason to start a war. Karabakh is already de-facto free. Azeri Guest: Nope, Armenians started it. It's beneficial for Armenia to provoke a war. Armenian Guest: why would they? Azeri Guest: so Artsakh separatists can launch a process for independence. (apparently crack pipe is on sale on Amazon. Cyber Crackday. Black Plaqueday. Big if true.) Russian Host sits next to Azeri guest: are you sure about that? Azeri Guest: Yes. Why not? [theme changes about Syrian mercenaries] Russian Host: I can't confirm 100%, but here is a video from Azerbaijan showing a column of fighters in pickup trucks with flags and [Allahu Akbar] chants. Do these men chant in Azeri or Arabic? Azeri Guest: they are Azeri because I heard their accent with "e" instead of "a" while chanting "akbar". Syrians don't have "e". It's unique to Turkic. Armenian Guest: the pro-Turkish fighters in northern Syria are ethnic Turkmen, not necessarily Arab. Russian Guest: we can send it to professional linguists for analysis. https://youtu.be/uFxsQ3uBIyY?t=1643 https://youtu.be/3VOpGDtCVgI</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Not a bad theory. But why hasnt Russia stepped in by now? Pashinyan must activate the CSTO agreement. Unless, this is what Aliyev whants him to do? Because this will trigger Turkey to be more activaly involved?</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I am honestly not comfortable having Mr lavrov and the dickhead meddling in our behalf. Are we willing/ready once again go back to status quo? I mean after all this, is it possible to start negotiate with Aliyev. Seriously? Only thing i can think of is that if status quo realize once again. For fuck sake. We have to start inventing, at least be on par with other countries regarding latest military technologies. The government need to invest whatever funds they have, and great portion must be dedicated to inovation. If we cant buy at least lets make our own hardware.</TEXT>

People living in NK is a democracy, you are forcing a dictatorial rule, which is not an option for NK population. With that include force migration and racism, which your other minorities struggles with each day. Such as Lezgi people. What Aliyev has done now, there is no return for an inch of land. Can you image how far your government has taking it? Bombing our church, bring in terrorists, involving Turkey, bombing civilian settlements meaning apartment buildings!</TEXT>

If Aliyev only could show a little acceptance regarding our rights to self determination. There would be no problem to draw back the military. But this incentive must be visible and verbally coming from your government. We just need proof of trust. That #8217;s how humans work. Obviously that has its limits as well, and he has certainly made sure that no trust can be made between our people. There are already multiple sources of racism and oppression against lezgin and avars. You can #8217;t defend it, give up. And regarding importing terrorist, every news channel has basically reporting this as a fact by now. Both France and Russia has evidence so does the Armenian government.</TEXT>
