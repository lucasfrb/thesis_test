Especially Ride on sea from Rev1. -Comeback of survival action as opposed to straight up action like RE6. -Raid mode. Was fun to grind with co-op partners. -Character tie-ins. Answered questions about Jill, Claire and Barry.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I just finished watching the movie and it is a 5/10 only because it had good action scenes. But I can just watch a YouTube video of all the MI6 action scenes put together. I have a fundamental problem with the MI series and this movie also has huge chunks of it. An action movie should know what category of action movie it belongs to and shouldn't try hard in seeming special. MI series does this and annoys the crap out of me every time I see an MI movie after believing the hype. The writing in between action set pieces are painfully average fillers. They might as well own up to it and keep it simple. But the way they throw cliche after cliche from the holy book of spy cliches is laughable. Also they present these spy cliches like they are mind blowing twists. For instance, the scene after the chase scene where Ethan Hunt extracts Lane. Hunt talks to Elsa from MI6. The dialogue between them is a prime example of the pretentious way they present their twists. I am a Tom Cruise fanboy. I should just be able to watch any shit thrown at me if Tom Cruise is doing cool stuff. But there are certain limits to that. I can't not complain when weak writing is presented like solid. Rant over. I'd rewatch MI 1, 3, Skyfall and Golden Eye 100 times over rewatching MI 2,4,5 and 6. Cuz they had better structured plots.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Maybe as soon as you press aim it centers around the enemy. But when moving the gun around, I felt no aim assist. However, RE5 had zero aim assist. Aiming was very fluid. Even better than a mouse IMO because the weighty feel didn't connect well with the mouse.</TEXT>

    <TITLE>Single and young vegans. PLEASE READ!</TITLE>
    <DATE>2019-09-02 06:34:21</DATE>
    <TEXT>My fellow vegans, especially those of you who are single and young, do not get into a serious relationship based on a vegan bond, however strong it is. Even if you want to, make sure they have been vegan/vegetarian for a VERY long time (almost their entire life). I learnt this the hard way and I do not want this to happen to anyone. Especially to those who are strict about only dating vegans/vegetarians. My wife was the staunchest vegan I have ever known. I met her in the New Zealand vegan dating group three years ago. Few years after adopting the vegan lifestyle in 2013, she started experiencing gut illnesses. A month ago, she was convinced that plants  amp; carbs were the culprits for her poor gut health after doing tons of research and wanted to stray from veganism. I objected first due to the strong bond we had due to veganism. After a few discussions, my love and care took over and I told her I'd be okay with whatever she eats as long as she is healthy and happy. She tried dairy and eggs first. There was improvement but not as much as she hoped for. She saw a doctor and he said her gut health was pretty poor and that she was pretty close to Chron's Disease. The doctor told her to eat mostly animal based foods such as meat, eggs and dairy. Apparently, fiber makes her guts flare up. Even though veganism was the sole foundation of our relationship and that I haven't eaten meat or eggs my whole life, I was prepared to have a marriage where one member is a hardcore omni. But things changed for the worse and everything went downhill. She started doing research about ex-vegans and she started turning to the dark side by the day. When I met her, she used to debate with everyone that humans were herbivores/frugivores. Now she is convinced humans are OBLIGATE CARNIVORES. The body apparently needs animal cholesterol to function and plants are 100% detrimental to human health. (It gets worse) Everyday, I was waking up to her shoving "credible research" about pro-meat/anti-vegan studies in my face. Apparently some study showed that vegans have more brain shrinkage over time as opposed to omnis. She kept pestering me to eat meat otherwise I'd go retarded. She shared another research that stated it's technically impossible to be vegan because when you're on a plant-based diet, your body eats on your muscles due to lack of animal protein (It gets worse). Through a video, she arrived at a conclusion that even herbivores aren't herbivores and they start eating animals due to lack of animal protein. She said it's graphic so I am scared to watch it. If someone has the stomach to watch animal violence, please go ahead and opine on it in the comments: https://youtu.be/TdTXaFtDqZE Oh yes, it still gets worse. As per her research, plants apparently release toxins when they are harvested. These toxins are detrimental for the human body's immune system and can lead to depression, heart disease etc. Whenever I joyfully shared a pic of what I was eating at work, she always scorned at it because it was plant-based and full of toxins. It came to a point where I put my foot down and told her to not impose her omni lifestyle on me in a "You do you" way. I also reminded her that when she was vegan, she told me she would leave me instantly if I quit veganism and that it's extremely unfair to change me into the very thing she hated once. Her reply to all of this was "Fine. I refuse to cook toxins for you from now on". I keep telling her I have been vegetarian all my life and the farthest I can go is consume dairy from a legit happy cow farm. We used to feed ducks. Now she eats ducks. Her omni parents were gonna slaughter and eat a rescued chicken in 2018. She cried that it was gonna die so I went out of my way to find a rescue shelter via this group and made her happy. Now she eats chickens and tells me to eat them cuz I am not a cow but a lion, an obligate carnivore. "Don't be a deluded vegan hippie" she said. She did petty things like change my name to "Angry Vegan" on her phone. The same person who used to share Gary's best speech with her omni friends and family started using the "circle of life" argument and claimed she'd even go as far as hunting animals instead of supporting factory farming. I didn't know who my wife was anymore. We decided to get separated few days ago. I gave it all I had to save this marriage. I really tried but everything was devolving. Anyway, If I had to summarize my life in July, I'd combine two memes. My ex would be Charlie from Sunny in Philly (Pepe Sylvia scene) and I would be Obi Wan yelling "You became the very thing you swore to destroy".</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Yeah, I am 28 but this was my first relationship. After finishing my Master's Degree, I was pretty lost. I didn't know what to do in life as my ultimate focus prior to that was my education. Not to brag, but I've had girls flirt with me before. I ignored them because I didn't wanna get distracted and fail. Even with my ex, it was she who added me on Facebook via that group and relentlessly flirted with me after we played one game (Battlefield 1) online. At that moment, I felt like I found a new purpose in life and reciprocated her advances. The relationship was pretty problematic but I always managed to fix things. A lot of things that were once prerequisites downgraded from her side but I tuned myself to accept the changes. Being from a staunch lacto-vegetarian family, I initially couldn't handle the downgrade from vegan to omni. Later, I still tuned myself to accept it as it was for her health. What I couldn't handle was when she kept pestering me to go non-vegan. Relationship wasn't solely based on veganism. It's just one of the things we had in common. It is a prerequisite for me but it's not for her anymore.</TEXT>

    <TITLE>Should I warn the guy who's seeing my soon to be ex-wife?</TITLE>
    <DATE>2019-09-08 22:59:30</DATE>
    <TEXT>I broke up with my overly manipulative wife at the end of July. We haven't filed for divorce nor do we have any separation agreement. She started seeing another guy in less than a month after I broke up with her. They have already made plans to get engaged. She was my first love and I was an innocent man before she came in to life. I say she came into my life because it was she who aggressively flirted with me and clung to me with lots of love in a matter of weeks. But things changed after we got married. I was just a boy toy or man servant to her after marriage. At first, I let myself get manipulated because she was the love of my life. 3 years passed. I could not handle it anymore and decided to end it after 3 years. This new guy is in the same situation I was in 2016. He met her less than a month ago and has already decided to get engaged. I really wish someone had warned me about what a toxic mess my fiance is and made me dodge a bullet. Since I am still legally married to her, do I not have the right to talk to him and his parents in private? EDIT: I failed to mention that I wanted to inform him that she is already married and then warn him about her if he cared to listen.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I have been in only one relationship, which progressed all the way till marriage. And now I am getting divorced cuz I couldn't handle the manipulation and gaslighting anymore. Long story short, she is the most indecisive person I have ever met. Like most people, I feel very guilty if I ever have to go back on my word or change my mind at the last minute. Especially if others are involved. Even for petty things such as changing or cancelling dinner/movie plans would make me feel like shit. But my (soon to be) ex-wife would change her mind on critical things (commitments that she convinced me of which cost me time and money) like as though it's a switch and would take absolutely no accountability for her actions. In fact, she'd make me feel like a heartless monster for even questioning her lack of commitment. She'd say preposterous things like "You shouldn't be too attached to the material world" when her change of mind cost me money and I'd call her out on it. She has only studied high school. Dropped out of 4 degrees with a massive student loan. And I have an MBA from the top ranking uni in the country. But she always acted like as though she has two PhDs and I was a high school dropout.</TEXT>

    <TITLE>My review of Control (PC)</TITLE>
    <DATE>2019-09-13 09:34:17</DATE>
    <TEXT>LONG READ Here are my detailed thoughts on Control (PC). Story Plot  #8211; The game starts with Jesse Faden showing up at the headquarters of Federal Bureau of Control (FBC). She is there to be appointed as the new director of FBC. But it #8217;s revealed that she is mainly there to find her missing brother. She finds Zach Trench, the former director, dead in his office and most of the people at FBC are possessed by a paranormal entity she refers to as THE HISS. As the new director, Jesse takes control of the director #8217;s gun, which, like green lantern #8217;s ring, can morph into various gun types and give the wielder numerous abilities. With some help from survivors, Jesse uses her service weapon and powers to fight the hiss while looking for her brother. The plot isn #8217;t spectacular but it maintained my interest for the most part. However, the ending left me with some unanswered questions. What's the mystery behind the janitor? Where did the mould enemies come from? Hopefully, these are addressed in the DLC. Characters  #8211; What I liked about Jesse is that she isn #8217;t your typical badass female. I got the feeling that the game wanted me to observe how a corporate woman deals with the paranormal catastrophe in her new workplace and how she grows into a badass by taking control of the situation. As for the supporting characters, most, if not all of them are included mainly for exposition. Only a few supporting characters stood out for me. There #8217;s Emily Pope, who is passionate about paranormal entities. Langston, who is the head of security at Panopticon. I #8217;d say he is the funniest character in the game. And of course, you have the mysterious Janitor, Ahti, who has an excellent taste in music. Figuring out his accent would be a bigger mystery than the Hiss. Sadly, none of the other characters left an impression on me. In fact, the game makes some characters go missing in the third act without offering much explanation to the viewers. Overall, I #8217;d say the characters are serviceable to the story but none of them are developed as much as they could have been. I find that disappointing because all the supporting characters in Max Payne 1  amp; 2 were fleshed out. Visuals Graphics and animation  #8211; With their last game, Quantum Break, Remedy was going for a photo-realistic aesthetic with solid character models and weighty animations. That style helped in transitioning to the live-action cutscenes in the story. In Control, you can see that Remedy was going for a non-linear setting with fast paced superhero combat. Hence, they toned down the realistic visuals as the scale of the game would make such visuals too demanding. That #8217;s not a bad thing, however. In fact, it's great because they compensated by including excellent particle effects and destructive physics in the game. The game doesn #8217;t hold your hand when you are navigating through the building. The developers want you to not just rely on the map but also the signs that lead you to various sectors within the FBC. At first it was really annoying and I was wishing for a waypoint system like that of Dead Space, but I eventually got used to it. I knew the layout of some sectors like the back of my hand during the end game. When I was exploring the map, I would often stop to check out how the environment would respond to my attacks. Playing with the physics of the game never got old. So it #8217;s safe to say that the visuals were impressive overall. If I had to nit-pick, there were a few mildly annoying things. There were texture pop-ins every time I loaded or respawned in the game. I felt the movement animation could use some polish. Her running animation wasn #8217;t in sync with her speed and often times, the animation for climbing stairs would not work. And lastly, although the gun is pretty fun to use, I found the design to be toyish and doesn #8217;t sell me as a deadly weapon. Like I said, minor nit-picks. Gameplay At its core, Control is a third person shooter. Jesse #8217;s gun can morph into various weapon types such as grip, shatter, spin, pierce and charge. But the way I played it, it #8217;s a third person superhero game that features gunplay. Jesse is basically Jean Grey with a gun. She uses telekinesis to propel objects and enemies, to shield herself using debris, to levitate and to turn enemies into allies. You can also add mods to upgrade Jesse #8217;s service weapon and her abilities. Both her abilities and the gun are limited by cooldown. With a versatile weapon and many powerful abilities, it would be hard to balance all of them without responsive controls. This is where Remedy shines. You are free to use any ability of your choosing and can seamlessly switch to another ability or the service weapon without breaking the flow of combat. However, the predictable AI holds the game back from having perfect combat. During the second act, Jesse becomes overpowered. Fighting weak AI with an overpowered character is like the game providing cheat codes to the player. The mission structure is the weakest aspect of the gameplay. For a large portion of the game, you cleanse control points by doing errands for various NPCs. These control points are basically check-points that can be used for fast travel, respawning and upgrading your character. Jesse is asked to do mundane tasks such as retrieving an object, escorting a person or flipping a switch that helps the FBC. Although, this game is not even remotely messy like Mass Effect Andromeda, I do feel Control shares one problem with that game. The main characters in both games rise to a powerful position at the start of the game. The NPCs should have no business to even ask the pathfinder or the director to do mean tasks. There is a mission where Jesse is asked to literally talk to the plants. I am not kidding. I found myself wondering, is Jesse the director or the errand girl? Sound Voice acting  #8211; Although the characters in the game didn #8217;t pack a lot of depth, the voice actors all gave solid performances. Courtney Hope, who played Beth Wilder in Quantum Break, did the voiceover and performance capture for the lead character in this game. Since the story of the game is not that long and ends abruptly, I #8217;d say all the actors excelled at what they were given to work with. Like I mentioned earlier, James McAffrey being in this game was what made me pre-order it. Unfortunately, I #8217;d say his talent was wasted in the game. Without getting into spoilers, his character is only presented through voice logs. Sound effects  #8211; Sound designers are the unsung heroes in both movies and gaming. We hear a lot of praise about Control #8217;s graphics and physics engine and it #8217;s well deserved but the sound engineering in the game made the visuals more impactful. Audio feedback for Jesse #8217;s gun, her abilities and how the environment reacts to those two make the player feel like they can give any Jedi a run for their money. Music  #8211; Except for one heavy metal song that plays during the last act of the game, the rest of the tracks in the game were average at best. That #8217;s a shame because Max Payne 1 and 2 had pretty memorable soundtracks. Summary Plot  #8211; 7/10 Characters  #8211; 7/10 Graphics  amp; animation  #8211; 9/10 Controls  #8211; 10/10 Mechanics  #8211; 10/10 A.I  #8211; 6.5/10 Mission Structure  #8211; 6/10 Music  #8211; 6.5/10 Rating = 8/10 Verdict Control offers excellent visuals and fluid gameplay, with story and character that are serviceable. The predictable AI and repetitive mission structure hold the player back from using the game #8217;s strengths to the fullest. In the end, this game has a very strong core with rough edges that can be polished in the DLC or a sequel perhaps? I give Control an 8/10.</TEXT>

    <TITLE>Control (2019) - Review (PC)</TITLE>
    <DATE>2019-09-23 07:55:16</DATE>
    <TEXT>Remedy games will always have a special place in my heart mainly because they created Max Payne. And when I heard that James McAfree, the voice behind Max Payne, plays a character in Control, I immediately pre-ordered the game. After having completed all the quests in the game, I can safely say that that pre-ordering this game wasn't a mistake. Story Plot  #8211; The game starts with Jesse Faden showing up at the headquarters of Federal Bureau of Control (FBC). She is there to be appointed as the new director of FBC. But it #8217;s revealed that she is mainly there to find her missing brother. She finds Zach Trench, the former director, dead in his office and most of the people at FBC are possessed by a paranormal entity she refers to as THE HISS. As the new director, Jesse takes control of the director #8217;s gun, which, like green lantern #8217;s ring, can morph into various gun types and give the wielder numerous abilities. With some help from survivors, Jesse uses her service weapon and powers to fight the hiss while looking for her brother. The plot isn #8217;t spectacular but it maintained my interest for the most part. However, the ending left me with some unanswered questions. Characters  #8211; What I liked about Jesse is that she isn #8217;t your typical badass female. I got the feeling that the game wanted me to observe how a corporate woman deals with the paranormal catastrophe in her new workplace and how she grows into a badass by taking control of the situation. As for the supporting characters, most, if not all of them are included mainly for exposition. Only a few supporting characters stood out for me. There #8217;s Emily Pope, who is passionate about paranormal entities. Langston, who is the head of security at Panopticon. I #8217;d say he is the funniest character in the game. And of course, you have the mysterious Janitor, Ahti, who has an excellent taste in music. Figuring out his accent would be a bigger mystery than the Hiss. Sadly, none of the other characters left an impression on me. In fact, the game makes some characters go missing in the third act without offering much explanation to the viewers. Overall, I #8217;d say the characters are serviceable to the story but none of them are developed as much as they could have been. I find that disappointing because all the supporting characters in Max Payne 1  amp; 2 were fleshed out. Visuals Graphics and animation  #8211; With their last game, Quantum Break, Remedy was going for a photo-realistic aesthetic with solid character models and weighty animations. That style helped in transitioning to the live-action cutscenes in the story. In Control, you can see that Remedy was going for a non-linear setting with fast paced superhero combat. Hence, they toned down the realistic visuals as the scale of the game would make such visuals too demanding. That #8217;s not a bad thing, however. In fact, it's great because they compensated by including excellent particle effects and destructive physics in the game. The game doesn #8217;t hold your hand when you are navigating through the building. The developers want you to not just rely on the map but also the signs that lead you to various sectors within the FBC. At first it was really annoying and I was wishing for a waypoint system like that of Dead Space, but I eventually got used to it. I knew the layout of some sectors like the back of my hand during the end game. When I was exploring the map, I would often stop to check out how the environment would respond to my attacks. Playing with the physics of the game never got old. So it #8217;s safe to say that the visuals were impressive overall. If I had to nit-pick, there were a few mildly annoying things. There were texture pop-ins every time I loaded or respawned in the game. I felt the movement animation could use some polish. Her running animation wasn #8217;t in sync with her speed and often times, the animation for climbing stairs would not work. And lastly, although the gun is pretty fun to use, I found the design to be toyish and doesn #8217;t sell me as a deadly weapon. Like I said, minor nit-picks. Gameplay At its core, Control is a third person shooter. Jesse #8217;s gun can morph into various weapon types such as grip, shatter, spin, pierce and charge. But the way I played it, it #8217;s a third person superhero game that features gunplay. Jesse is basically Jean Grey with a gun. She uses telekinesis to propel objects and enemies, to shield herself using debris, to levitate and to turn enemies into allies. You can also add mods to upgrade Jesse #8217;s service weapon and her abilities. Both her abilities and the gun are limited by cooldown. With a versatile weapon and many powerful abilities, it would be hard to balance all of them without responsive controls. This is where Remedy shines. You are free to use any ability of your choosing and can seamlessly switch to another ability or the service weapon without breaking the flow of combat. However, the predictable AI holds the game back from having perfect combat. During the second act, Jesse becomes overpowered. Fighting weak AI with an overpowered character is like the game providing cheat codes to the player. The mission structure is the weakest aspect of the gameplay. For a large portion of the game, you cleanse control points by doing errands for various NPCs. These control points are basically check-points that can be used for fast travel, respawning and upgrading your character. Jesse is asked to do mundane tasks such as retrieving an object, escorting a person or flipping a switch that helps the FBC. Although, this game is not even remotely messy like Mass Effect Andromeda, I do feel Control shares one problem with that game. The main characters in both games rise to a powerful position at the start of the game. The NPCs should have no business to even ask the pathfinder or the director to do mean tasks. There is a mission where Jesse is asked to literally talk to the plants. I am not kidding. I found myself wondering, is Jesse the director or the errand girl? Sound Voice acting  #8211; Although the characters in the game didn #8217;t pack a lot of depth, the voice actors all gave solid performances. Courtney Hope, who played Beth Wilder in Quantum Break, did the voiceover and performance capture for the lead character in this game. Since the story of the game is not that long and ends abruptly, I #8217;d say all the actors excelled at what they were given to work with. Like I mentioned earlier, James McAffrey being in this game was what made me pre-order it. Unfortunately, I #8217;d say his talent was wasted in the game. Without getting into spoilers, his character is only presented through voice logs. Sound effects  #8211; Sound designers are the unsung heroes in both movies and gaming. We hear a lot of praise about Control #8217;s graphics and physics engine and it #8217;s well deserved but the sound engineering in the game made the visuals more impactful. Audio feedback for Jesse #8217;s gun, her abilities and how the environment reacts to those two make the player feel like they can give any Jedi a run for their money. Music  #8211; Except for one heavy metal song that plays during the last act of the game, the rest of the tracks in the game were average at best. That #8217;s a shame because Max Payne 1 and 2 had pretty memorable soundtracks. Summary Plot  #8211; 7/10 Characters  #8211; 7/10 Graphics  amp; animation  #8211; 9/10 Controls  #8211; 10/10 Mechanics  #8211; 10/10 A.I  #8211; 6.5/10 Mission Structure  #8211; 6/10 Music  #8211; 6.5/10 Rating = 8/10 Verdict Control offers excellent visuals and fluid gameplay, with story and character that are serviceable. The predictable AI and repetitive mission structure hold the player back from using the game #8217;s strengths to the fullest. In the end, this game has a very strong core with rough edges that can be polished in the DLC or a sequel perhaps? I give Control an 8/10.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I don't mind female representation in games but I do not appreciate under representation of EXISTING male characters. Brick and Mordy were basically cameos. Zero was a silent grunt. The only male characters that had a lot of screen time were Rhys, Vaughn and Hammerlock. They're not bad characters but they're beta sorry. The end credits were cringy as hell with heavy focus on Ava. She was the worst part of the game. They should have killed her instead of my girl, Maya. I played over 1000 hours BL2 as Siren. Pissed me the hell off to see her get killed after a few scenes.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>People say the story has loopholes. Er....I'd say the movie has substance sprinkled over massive loopholes. Infinity War was much better. The time heist was presented like Italian Job but carried out like Rick  amp; Morty. They didn't even explain how Cap returned all the stones to the original location. Oldman Cap being at the park doesn't make sense based how they explain time travel works in the movie. P.S I love both DC and Marvel as I'm a comic book guy but I don't like MCU much besides Iron Man 1, Civil War, IW. Also I LOVE Daredevil.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Overall a decent movie. I do have some gripes though. Everyone knows about the positives so I won't go over those. The smoking - He smoked way too much. I know they were not going for comic book accuracy but there was no reason to make Joker a chain smoker. You could replace smoking with any other toxic habit and it would have made no difference to the plot. The laugh - I really dug how there was a psychological condition aspect to his laugh. But the movie was building up his laugh like he is gonna struggle with it first and then get the maniacal Joker cackle in the end. I was hoping for him to laugh like The Joker when he is standing on the hood of a car. I guess I am just spoiled by the voice actors such as Mark Hamill, John DiMaggio etc. The Waynes - I was hoping this is the Joker that goes against Rob Pat's Batman. If the Bruce Wayne in this movie grows up to be Rob's Batman, Joker would be around 70 by then! I also was not a fan of how Thomas Wayne was portrayed like a rich snob. Martha Wayne was little more than a picture in the movie. It would have been better if she was the one discarding all of Penny's letters or answering Arthur at the gate. The fridge scene - I get that it was to show that he is losing his mind but it went nowhere as the movie just cuts to him sleeping on his bed. I thought he was gonna come out of the fridge shivering but cackling at the same time. Disclaimer: I am not a Ledger fanboy. In fact, I think he is fairly overrated. I really hated the tongue rolling/clicking thing he did whenever he spoke. Also, he kept calling himself an agent of chaos/man without a plan but he had fairly planned sketches throughout the movie. I'm just one of those fans who wants to see a live action version of a Mark Hamill-esque joker.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>The complaint wasn't specifically against smoking. It was against gratuitousness. Joker has never smoked in any of the previous portrayals, whether live action or animated. Also, in India it's the law to have a smoking warning whenever there is smoking on the screen. The warning was basically a watermark in the movie cuz Joker was smoking like a damn furnace non-stop. Annoyed the crap out of me.</TEXT>

Like he starts taking them excessively after his shrink lays him off cuz he can't get medication anymore. Smoking destroys your throat. For someone who wants to cackle like a goblin, smoking didn't fit. Just my opinion</TEXT>

    <TEXT>That's exactly why I suggested they make him take drugs after his therapy was discontinued. He goes crazier, or thinks he does, without his prescription meds so he starts taking some illegal drug. There's a point in that case. It would be the Ace Chemical equivalent. Removing his smoking makes no difference to the plot. Not all poor people smoke. I feel they made him smoke to look cooler. Especially during post-transformation.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Yeah, it would change the plot. My aim wasn't to add something that wouldn't alter the plot. Being influenced by a chemical substance is an integral part of Joker's origin. Like I said, replacing Ace Chemicals with a shady drug he took out of desperation after being kicked out of therapy would have added to his transition from Arthur to Joker. Like how it was in The Killing Joke.</TEXT>

The part about Vendetta, come on dude. That's reaching. You gotta defend yourself from zombies. I think the devs don't want the protagonist to officially cross the line of human body count. Most human "kills" are mostly through explosions and crashes. Whether or not those humans survived is debatable. So far, I can't recall any direct kills. The playable characters in ORC are the only ones but they aren't really protagonists. Also, the story in ORC isn't canon.</TEXT>

    <TITLE>Star Wars Prequels are actually good.</TITLE>
    <DATE>2019-10-28 17:42:24</DATE>
    <TEXT>I have never seen Star Wars prequels until today. The movies I have seen are 4,5,6,7,8 and Rogue one. I wanted to do a chronological run before Episode 9 releases. I finished watching episodes 1-3 today. I feel the prequels get far more hate than they deserve. I actually enjoyed these prequels more than episodes 7 and 8. Those 2 were like MCU movies with Star Wars setting. Did not have the Star Wars feel besides lightsabers and space battles. The prequels, I felt, had strong plot and iconic characters. The music was bloody amazing. Jar Jar binks was annoying, yeah, but I have seen annoying characters like that in other adventure movies. Ewan McGregor as Obi Wan was pretty damn cool. He stole the show. Hayden did his best with the cheesy dialogues he was given. People hate on him way too much.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>True. Even if Jar Jar had the same amount of screen time in episodes 2 and 3, I would have been able to handle it. He falls under the "babbling sidekick in an adventure movie" trope. Rose from Ep8 was FAR more annoying. Jar Jar Binks was at least campy. Rose seemed like a person I would not wanna talk to IRL.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Sequels also ruined things established in the previous movies. Lightsabers aren't so deadly in the sequels unless used against a goon or baddie. I mean seriously. Finn and Rey should have died multiple times. GTFO with the "tis but a scratch" bs. Last time I checked, Jedis needed to be trained since childhood to be proficient with force and lightsaber. Rey being good at both negates that completely.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I totally agree. I speak English as good as a native speaker. Thanks to my strict English school and movies+comics+TV. When I moved to New Zealand in 2015 to do my MBA, I noticed there were a shit ton of Chinese students in my cohort. I was the only non-Chinese in my first project group. 90% of the group discussions were in Mandarin. They put close to no effort in communicating in English. One of em even joked that I should learn Mandarin. I ended up doing just my part of the project and presentation and fucked off by the end of the semester. I didn't care about teamwork and neither did they.</TEXT>

Plus he is the son of Darth freaking Vader. Who tf is Rey? It's been 2 movies.

    <TEXT>I have a loud bassy voice. People think I am yelling even when I don't aim to. If I actually attempted to yell, it sounds a LOT louder. It's hard for me to whisper or talk low in a gentle manner. My voice also gets louder as I get more comfortable while talking. I am not making this up. I have a wide neck and when my vocal cords relax as I delve deeper in the conversation/discussion, I sound louder with me having no control over it unless I try to in an unnatural way. As a result, I have never been taken seriously in any serious discussion I my family. Doesn't help that I am the youngest. I'm always shut down with the "Don't yell. Be more mature" argument and left with the image like I lost the argument because I got emotional. I am sick of telling people that, in my mind, I am not actually yelling.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I really enjoyed the improved gameplay and graphics but everything else was either a mess or lackluster. Loot - The game just throws loot at you. A lot of them aren't even interesting. You use loot more for selling as opposed to using. Story - I am all for female representation and empowerment in video games but they shouldn't come at the expense of established male characters. All the badass male characters from BL1 amp;2 were reduced to cameos. The only male characters that got considerable screen time were annoying beta males such as Rhys and Vaughn. The meta humour writing from BL1 amp;2 is barely there in this game. They were trying to appeal to the current internet meme generation and failed. SPOILERS: Halfway through the game, they kill off one of the main female badasses from previous games just to be replaced by a lil girl who is a serious bratt. Performance - The PC port is so poorly optimized that I wish I had gotten it on console. A game with cartoony graphics should not be this demanding. My PC goes beyond the recommended specs for 1440p gaming. And I get poor frame rate even at 1080p. Endgame - The game isn't as replayable as BL2. I beat the story and am almost at max level but the endgame content such as Mayhem (score multiplier) and TVHM (New game plus with harder difficulty) don't motivate me enough and I am forcing myself to reach lvl 50.</TEXT>

Based on my experience, I should look out for these red flags in my future relationship(s): 1) Silent treatment/cold shoulder. Manipulative behavior. 2) Crying too quickly for petty things. 3) Indecisive/ changes mind irrationally without considering others 4) Entitlement.

    <TEXT>This movie is another unofficial remake of Fugitive that fails. The other one is Taken 3. Olympus and London were much better. All I wanted to see was Gerard Butler kick ass. Instead I got him running from feds and mercs while getting migraines every 10 minutes. The part where he escapes from the car after he gets captured by the mercs was filmed rather poorly. I got a headache from the shaky cam and quick cuts.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>1) Eggs aren't vegetarian. They never were. Western market just changed the meaning for convenience and money. In India, eggs are non-veg :) 2) I only ate vegetarian foods and ate at veg restaurants. In India, you have something called AgMark. Veg foods have a green dot on their labels. And non-veg foods have red dot. 3) When I lived in New Zealand, there was no agmark. I just checked the ingredients.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Women will fight against fat shaming, slut shaming, thin shaming etc. etc. and society not only lauds them for doing so but brutally shames those who shame them. Not saying it's wrong but guys do not get that much privilege and protection. Single shaming/virgin shaming is one of the first things women resort to in arguments when they can't think of anything clever. Especially online. They look at your relationship status and start throwing around the word INCEL. And don't get me started on short guy shaming. There are girls who are the size of a pillow who'd act picky about not dating guys below 6. And they'd have the audacity to laugh at short guys after. I feel that women are getting a lot of protection whereas guys have rights taken away from them. Any man who complains about unfairness between genders is automatically deemed an incel cry baby. Men are easily the most unappreciated members of society today. My advice: Focus all of this frustration at the gym. Self love is key. With a fit body, you'll get more confident.</TEXT>

Even if they're supposed to be negative roles, the portrayal is so twisted. They are killing way too many innocents for me to see them as protagonists. I started hating Elizabeth when she kills the man who was fixing his car just that a job opens up for one of the people she's working. I started hating Philip when it is implied that he killed the engineer when he and that TV personality were getting some codes from a supercomputer in season 2. These 2 have ended so many lives, but they keep saying they do it for the world to be a better place? I'm a big fan of Homeland and all I could think of was Carrie shutting their asses down.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>If they're not terrorists, why are they preparing for bio-war? If this was Homeland, Philip and Elizabeth would be villains. I'm close to the end of season 4, Philip and Elizabeth have single handedly ended the lives of many innocents by now. If someone kills even 5 or fewer people in a shooting or bomb blast, they are seen as terrorists. Those two would have killed at least 10 innocents/lawmen by now. I love Martha and I teared up a little when she had to go. Philip straight up ruined her life. There is no debate about that. And like I said, Elizabeth brutally murdered a man just so that the woman (I do not know her name but she was black) gets a job. Can you imagine if there was an entire episode that focused on the families of people these 2 killed? How far can collateral damage go? My point is, why do they even bother humanizing these characters? They are, by definition, psychopaths or at least sociopaths. Stan Beeman is easily my favorite character in the show. He's so well acted by Noah Emmerich and he is on par with Hank from Breaking Bad for me.</TEXT>

But that bio weapon would definitely kill several hundred civilians or more like COVID 19 is doing now. Not sure if they want peace or eye for an eye. The two governments are fighting, no doubt. Unleashing a massive bio weapon would kill a lot more than just government officials. This is where I draw the line. Killing innocents to make a point to the government is terrorism for me. They have no part in the fight. Yeah, it is a very good show. But I feel it would be better if they portrayed the leads as full on negative roles being the leads. Some screen time showing what the families of their victims go through would be even better. The more I watch the show, the more I want the leads to face a brutal death sentence.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>That is exactly why I feel it would be better to portray them as fleshed out villains like in Homeland. To do the things you mention, it requires a certain lack of empathy. Clinically speaking, these two are sociopaths. So why not embrace it? They want to achieve their objectives and they are willing to do anything for it. They are WILLINGLY killing innocents. I'm the middle of S6 now and they have probably killed around 50 innocents+lawmen by now. They are not that different from sleeper cells and terrorists in Homeland. They also believe that US is a threat to their countries and are retaliating against drone strikes that have killed innocents. I love the show but I really want these 2 to suffer.

    <TEXT>I really wanted these fuckers, Philip and Elizabeth, to die horribly. I loved the show but was really pissed off by the main characters' killing spree of innocents over 6 seasons. I don't care if they reflected on them in the bedroom. Especially Elizabeth. She was a straight up sociopath and I wanted her to get blown to bits by Stan. They just made Stan let go of the people who killed Amador. Basically, Stan killed an innocent, Vlad, but let go of these commie spies who ended the lives of countless innocent people. I would have gotten some closure had they showed how miserable their lives were in Russia. That would have been a pleasure to watch. I actually thought there were 3 more episodes since all the previous seasons had 13 episodes each. Any other show would have killed them off cuz of karma. Was expecting them to get captured at least. I had so much built up anger towards these characters and binged through the later seasons hoping to see them suffer and die. If I knew how to make mods in games, I'd create two characters modeled after P amp;E Jennings and kill them several times. Okay. Rant over.</TEXT>

Normally, karma within the universe gets to characters like those. That's what I was expecting. If you sympathized with the leads, then you need to get your morales in check.

Actors such as Jason Statham, Karl Urban, Mel Gibson, Bruce Willis etc. do the stoic depressed badass with more substance. This formula (point A to B security/escort mission) has been done a million times before and I can name a few movies that did it better.

In Homeland, it has happened few times. In season 3, CIA operatives killed 2 police officers in the middle east. I was infuriated. But was happy to see them get killed later. Yeah, I'm not saying what Stan did was good. But the counts were fewer. Philip  amp; Elizabeth killed absolutely innocent people by the dozen. And Stan's worse? Makes no mathematical sense for me. Whoever intentionally killed more innocents is the bigger asshole. I would have liked the series if the two were portrayed like Lorne Malvo from Fargo or if they simply killed far fewer innocents.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Jill (or Claire/Rebecca) gets killed cuz of whatever biohazard there is in the village. Chris is on a revenge quest. Instead of drawing a line between killing BOWs and saving people, he just wants to wipe out that village before it spreads. He finds out Mia is responsible and kills her too. Think about it. He actually said "Yeah, but.." when Jill says "Millions will die" in RE5. He also got pretty angry while fighting Arias cuz he was a threat to Rebecca. Not to mention, his relentless pursuit against Ada (Carla). Chris doesn't take the deaths of his partners and squad mates lightly. He looks vengeful in RE8. They're probably gonna make him like Caesar from War of the POTA. I hope they take their time with it and don't pull an Anakin.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>They didn't want to hire union voice actors. It's cheaper for Capcom to get non-union VAs. That's fine but I wish they hired someone else. We JUST heard Jeff Schine as Carlos. And he wasn't even putting on a different voice. It seemed like a Carlos line was dubbed on to Chris poorly.</TEXT>

    <DATE>2020-08-27 17:57:53</DATE>
    <TEXT>I just finished watching the first season of Killing Eve. First few episodes were awesome. It was exactly what I expected after reading the synopsis. The show started to downgrade after Eve completely forgets that Villanelle killed her boss. I was so excited when Eve said "I am going to kill her with my bear hands". It made me think "Fuck yeah. An underdog woman going against a female psycho assassin to avenge a man she cared about. SOLD". And the writers throw that out of the window not even half an episode later. I was expecting a toe to toe cat and mouse story. The show also seems to treat its male characters in a super disposable way. They're all either misogynistic or don't possess more than 2 brain cells. I am not kidding, the story would has been over much quicker if any of the male characters were smarter than a fifth grader. This was pissing me off as the show progressed. And it didn't help that all the female kills/deaths were off camera or PG13 but the male ones were graphic. I love stories with female leads and am all for women empowerment but that shouldn't come at the expense of nerfing your male characters. That's lazy writing. I'm shocked that many regard S1 as the best season and that 2  amp; 3 are not as good. I can only imagine how crap 2 and 3 are gonna be like when I already hate 1 so much. The unnecessary comedy (MCU level) was also cringe worthy sometimes. It was fine in the earlier episodes when things didn't get serious for Eve. I loved Phoebe Waller Bridge's work in Fleabag and Rogue One but sadly this was a dud. Rant over.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I don't like episodic shows either. I agree with that one. But I just could not connect with the twisted, inconsistent tone and how the show didn't even try to hide its potholes and lazy writing. I feel like it won over non-spy thriller viewers with its glamorized tone. But that's subjective and I'm totally okay if people enjoy that. But there's no need to abandon consistent writing in some rather important points.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I have watched all those things you mentioned. Loved most of them. Especially Alita, Ghost in The Shell, and True Grit. I can say you may have missed the inconsistent writing cuz you liked the show and were more forgiving. 1) Konstantin KNEW that Eve saw the gun in the dashboard. And she was already challenging him with questions. Any idiot would have thought of taking the gun away. But no, intelligence officer with probably 30 years of experience has to leave the gun when he has to take a piss. 2) That short hostage situation/shooting involving Konstantin's daughter was laughable. Authorities would have come in way earlier. The writing is like "We're gonna have assassins, intelligence agencies and other serious shit in our plot but we are not gonna treat them like a soap opera would" 3) Konstantin's daughter was acting way too chill. I thought I was watching Deadpool or some parody. 4) Eve's boss/friend tailing V was straight up stupid and was like the other side of Deus Ex Machina. Villainelle has way too thick of a plot armor and the show isn't even trying to hide it. Even John Wick seemed more vulnerable and he is supposed to be even more badass and focused (as per lore comparison). These are only a few. If I had to fix the show, I'd have a tone like Homeland where the intelligence agencies/assassins aspect is portrayed seriously and make the cat  amp; mouse rivalry seem more intense like I Saw The Devil (2010). (Minus the torture of course cuz Eve wouldn't do that).</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I am not averse to romance. Not at all. Just not when they get cringe worthy (TO ME) and mess up the tone (FOR ME). I like romance when I can relate to the character(s) or if it's simply fan service (not to be taken seriously). If someone killed my best friend, I would be firm about wanting to "Kill them with my bare hands". The feelings for Eve towards V come out of nowhere and feel forced. And I generally don't like the "oopsie" tone about how death and chaos are portrayed. And no, I love the older 007 movies. Especially Sean Connery ones. I have been wanting to watch this show for years. I do not have Netflix. Prime Video added them here just this month. I hopped on it immediately. I guess I just expected something else when I read the premise in 2018.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Two aspects: Art style and gameplay Games that have a good art style and not just high polygon count/volumetric lighting age much better. Resident Evil 5 is 11 years old. IMHO it looks prettier than the RE engine titles such as RE7, 2make and 3 make. Plus the gunplay and co-op are incredibly satisfying. Same thing applies to Borderlands 2.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>If people think RE4 is survival horror, then they are either deluded or in denial. It has an 80s cheese story with ridiculous action setpieces. And Ada's campaign, especially at the area with multiple ships with heavy artillery, was like an exploitation movie (Barb Wire). The A.I is programmed to get better the more you interact with it. Most people who trash the A.I use it as a walking item box. If you give the A.I not more tha one fully upgraded precision weapon, armour vest and no healing items, it can actually be better than the average rando noob who joins and disrupts your playthrough. Cuz the A.I has impeccable accuracy and revive speed. There are only 2 horror games in RE. 1 and 2. 2 had a little bit of action whereas 1 was a maze style horror game. Fanboys don't realize that tone evolves when the threat keeps occurring over and again. Is Aliens a bad Alien movie cuz it had way more action than the first one?</TEXT>

    <TEXT>RE5 Veteran here. If your partner often dies, you failed at understanding the strengths of the partner and are probably using them as an item box. I play as Sheva mostly and I give Chris just one gun and that's a fully upgraded SIG P226. I also give him armour and eggs (no sprays). The A.I was a beast for the most part.</TEXT>
