    <TEXT>Wow what a story - thank you for putting in the effort to write so much! The story of the _rather pretty girl_ is very sweet. Too bad you were on the job and committed to keeping those telescopes positioned, I could totally see that going somewhere if you hadn't been busy. Your second story has considerably more substance, so apologies if I digress. I personally felt the story of "Clarabel", (which reminds me of the allergy tablet Claratine!) pulled on my heartstrings a bit - as I once, and possibly still am in a similar situation myself (she even happens to be a particularly good hugger too - but that may be my bias at play). Isn't there a song called total eclipse of the heart? (post google: wow, how accurate are the lyrics!) It is such a saddening feeling to watch someone you care about give a lot of their love and affection to someone else - especially if you don't feel they are deserving of that attention... I think it is very important to be aware of yourself, and as you said assessing your "love language" and making sure to compare possibly biased views on interactions with context. Jesus, that "I love-" cliffhanger might just have about killed me IRL if someone ever pulled that. I can tell by Clarabel's casual commentary on your personality on SC that she obviously is quite attuned to you, which makes it hurt more that she doesn't like you as a partner. I feel that it is never selfish of someone to verbalise their feelings to another human being, e.g. telling them they like them. Getting stuff out in the open is, in my opinion, almost always beneficial in some way. I applaud you for finally, properly, confronting your feelings for Clarabel because it takes guts, especially with how society has raised men to deal with these kinds of feelings, to then face those in a civil manner. Also, that Tinder bio sounds perfect for a social security scammer to match with you. Sorry for the tonal shift, but Gregrox, I don't mean to get all "wise and all knowing" on you, but no human being is worthy of love. All human beings _deserve_ love. We're social creatures and we need love as much as we need sleep and food. People aren't worthy of food, it's a human right. And so is love. I mean, I have to be careful not to cross into "nice guys" territory when I say "I deserve love". I mean on a basis of humanity and equity, we all deserve love. However, on a basis of owing each other love like taking a girl to dinner and paying and expecting a little something-something back - that's not the same. So, I guess the point I'm trying to make is try not to hold off as much next time you be catching feels. I know it is hard to break old habits, but I'm encouraging you to put yourself out there because we all deserve some love and connection! Edit: added line breaks</TEXT>

    <TEXT>My intelligence. I often purposely miss jokes in a funny way or "realise" something. I have a bit of a "shower thoughts" brain and so when I have moments of "Oh it's called a surname because it's your surs name! Like John's son. Oooh." I pass it off as being out of it and a little dumb at times. I also have an android and windows pc - so whenever I use apple I often complain I can't use it. However anyone who really knows me would call me out on my bullshit because they know I'm coming first in both my technology courses. But this dumbing down becomes _especially_ apparent around people I like. If I'm into someone but they're well, not quite on my level, I will bring my discussion to their level and find their jokes funnier and let them explain things even though I already know. Sometimes I will make myself dumber than them because I feel the need to make them feel secure... I got around this by dating smart people!</TEXT>

    <TEXT>NTA There's a difference between one or two cringe or weird comments to mess with your friends in that stupid friend dynamic way. E.g. calling your friend a furry when they buy cat ears for halloween. But this definitely crosses the line. _Especially_ because you specifically set up the line by telling him to stop because it made you uncomfortable. Plus "you should feel honoured to have such a pretty girlfriend" is crossing into objectifying territory... ngl. Plus most people make sure to be extra sure _not_ to come onto their friends girlfriends because that makes you look like a snake... maybe he needs a lesson or two updating him on social norms when it comes to girlfirends.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Just like be himself around me. Don't feel the need to always be doing something useful like asking me about study or work, or telling me things, legit just hang with me. My dad and I know each other's sense of humour so well just because we hang. Like we literally do nothing but watch movies and drive around to get my driving hours up. Also, don't be afraid to break down your own barriers - when I bought Cards against humanity to play with my friends, I sat down with dad and giggled over the cards with him. Drop me text, like link a video of your favourite formula 1 race, things which humanize you and break down the whole parental wall. Sure, it's good to still remind me to do my homework, but it's equally fun to watch the office montages. And, naturally as you do with friends, stuff like how you're really doing and what you're really feeling just comes up in conversation. Let it come naturally, teenagers are fickle creatures, I know, I am one. Edit: also, tell me stories from your teenagehood! I love to hear what you got up to when you were like me.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Knowing that life is so much easier as a guy, but also simultaneously only knowing your life. Like I get glimpses of it from MTF stories and people telling stories of how tech stores are easier and not getting judged in certain ways. But its that nagging understanding of knowing that I don't have it as good as guys but also not being able to verbalize why and what those differences are. I mean there definitely advantages to be being female and I appreciate that. And I'm grateful everyday that I was born with the anatomy that I associate with because being trans sounds really hard.</TEXT>

A lot or my friends are uncomfortable around guys because they've been at an all girls school since they were little and had zero interaction with teenage boys. How has your mum raised you to think about guys? Like does she always suggest they're up to no good and always want something from you? Either way, try gentle exposure. Go to something which is mostly gal friends with one or two of their boyfriends or something. You know he doesn't want you (or at least shouldn't) so you can interact on a friends only basis. Edit: plus those girls which were most uncomfortable about guys turned out to be bisexual and lesbian - so that might clarify things for you? Idk. Like straight girls will have incentive to be friendly and close to guys, but lesbian girls might not feel a need to get close to guys apart from friendship.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Im so so sorry that happened to you. Hes probably stressed or maybe someone is pushing him away from you? Usually a sudden 180 like this is due to external factors and isn't your fault, don't take it personally. I understand how hurtful it is for a guy to take things you confided in him and him to turn those into a weapon, it's shocking, it's hurts so bad because he makes you feel like it's true. But it's not. It's totally hyperbole which is so inflated that they're just unfair. I encourage you to talk to your support network - mum, sibling, friends and allow them to comfort you. Also, let yourself cry. Cry so hard it helps a lot. Like you actually expell bad chemicals in your tears. Edit, spelling</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Yeah thats very insightful. I'm no shrink but maybe you're a little self conscious about your body? Try body positivity things, talk opnely about your body with your gal friends. Or even better, make the guys uncomfortable! One way to keep them on their toes is to ask their opinion on tampons and then rant about periods for 15 minutes. Every guy friend I have has an unwillingly in depth knowledge of menstrual cycles thanks to me. Plus now I can period talk with them and they keep up!</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Sadness is relative, like motion. E.g. of you spend most of your time living at a decent standard of quality (e.g. middle class american) then something like getting a C or missing your friends party fucking sucks. However, if you consider someone like a poor minority, then getting a C is great because you aren't failing anymore and missing your friends birthday isn't that bad because you would have just been excluded at it anyways. So try consider where your relative point of happiness is - is it a fair standard to have? Are you taking things for granted? Or are you truly in a relative point where, yes, your sadness is sad. And if that didn't help, well then that's okay. Everyone is entitled to feel sad, it's a real emotion that people should experience in order to grow. But it is also equally fair to want to become cheerful again. Think of something you're looking forward to in the future... a birthday, a party, a game release, holidays. Think about how fun those are going to be and remember that they'll be happening soon enough.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I'm assuming most users of reddit currently are teenagers or above, so the youngest of us are 44 ish. We probably have long term partners, kids and jobs. In fact, our kids are probably teenagers themselves! I think it would be pretty hard to predict what me in that context would do. I will be so different from who I am now - 47, probably a mother, probably living in another city... in fact I'll almost be a different person, certainly all my cells would have replaced themselves several times over. So much can happen in 31 years, that's essentially living as long as I have currently lived 2 times more. That's insane. So what would I do? I have no idea. If I had to guess I imagine I would be so confused and shocked by time travelling that I would spend quite some time thinking about what to do - but I've always wanted to see the dinosaurs. Id maybe out of curiosity go meet my grandmother's when they were in their 40s too. Like try to talk to them as a mother and about their experiences raising my parents. Not that they'd know I was their grand daughter. If we have the technology to time travel I imagine we have half decent facial masking tech. I don't want them connecting the dots when I'm born and then I grow up, because then they might tell me that they met me time travelling because that would seriously stuff up the time line. I have a feeling it would have a similar feeling to when Captain America met his dad.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Think of a size D for women, which is like a small melon I guesstimate, but for a plus size woman due to the 32. At least that's how they are in Australia. For reference, a 10 to 14 would be an average woman. Edit. The letter is the breast size. The number is the "clothing" or rib cage size. The number is similar to the number size a girl would usually buy. E.g. a size 10 top is quite average and hence a 10 for bra number is average.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Have you done it already in school? I thought freshman was the equivalent of year 9! If not then congrats on already reading it because it is challenging - there's people in my "senior" (year 12) class who struggle with it. Anyways if you are heading into more year 9 - the best advice I can give is make time for your friends and don't take school too seriously. Like aim for B's but really don't sweat about grades because they don't count anyways right now! I mean pay attention so that you've got enough foundation for junior and senior year but like don't stress too hard. See your friends while you have the time :)</TEXT>

It was a gift from my dad and my first nice watch - it had an opal face and swarovski crystals all around the face, silver numbers and a beautiful watch band. It was a citizen watch and it had eco drive and the face went all rainbow in the light. My mother did the same thing when she was my age with another nice watch - I'd love to see both of those come back.</TEXT>

I was at a coding camp once when I was younger (like 9 yrs old) and I remember one of the boys didn't understand I was a girl because I was doing coding and wasn't wearing pink. It's so ingrained in our society that women aren't built for STEM. Do any of the universities have women in engineering programs? In Syndey at UNSW there's a whole women in engineering society. However this is incredibly progressive and UNSW is being hailed for their steps towards gender equality - I do hope you can find a local women in engineering or even just STEM community which you can join when studying. Sadly we are programmed from a really age gender stereotypes and this just becomes so ingrained that people struggle to expand their mindset.</TEXT>

    <TITLE>Fell in love with the tv series again!!</TITLE>
    <DATE>2020-01-02 09:54:29</DATE>
    <TEXT>After a session of dnd with my mates, we retired to the air conditioned tv room and after a series of rick roll attempts through chromecast I finally decided to actually put a show on. We bounced off Mulaney's new series and some Rick and Morty before I decided, hey, I haven't watched Dirk in a while and I put it on. Within seconds, two of the three people present exclaimed, "Oh I love this show! I need to rewatch it!" And the only Dirk Gently newbie quite enjoyed the show. I was ecstatic to find that my friends enjoy the show as much as I do and I'm currently halfway through season 1 again. I love rediscovering all these details which I didn't catch as well last time because I was just busy keeping up with everything that was going on. Also, someone said quite aptly to the newbie, "If the shot lasts for more than 3 seconds, it is important." And then we counted together as a shot on the corgi lasted 5 seconds! Very entertaining, plus when you pick up on foreshadowing with other people who have seen it you can go, "Oh its's the thing!!!" and there's that mutual "Yeah! I love this show!" Very wholesome. However, I forget how much violence is in the show. One of my friends is particularly violence sensitive and she was cringing a lot. As someone who watched shows like Bondi Vet from a young age this doesn't bother me. But it is something to note that many shows, including Dirk might have great plot lines and intricate detail which said friend can appreciate and love, but "too much" violence - resulting in them losing passion for the show. Another example is the Hannibal show on Stan - really interesting for her but when I watched it with her she liked it but couldn't stand the gore. Anyways, I love this show so much and I'm excited to rewatch!</TEXT>

The breeder sold us a "small golden retriever x poodle" which should grow to 10-14 kg. However, we were in for a shock when she grew up to be a hefty 17kg and medium height! Here are the [dog images](https://photos.app.goo.gl/cHrSNY1Vxy6rAVdQ7) from the front, side and angled. The red bar indicates 30cm in height or a portait A4 page. In terms of behaviour she is very dominant and alpha like. She has tried to take on a friend's Rottweiler once or twice because she doesn't know her place or size. She's hyperactive and tends to grunt more than she barks. Super friendly usually but can get quite angry towards small fluffy dogs. She is quite bossy because she knows she can always get what she wants because she is so cute. Thick as bricks however. After dedicated training from family members she struggled to get house trained and stop chewing. Sit is quite the struggle but if she sees our other dog doing it she will follow suit. No joke she definitely has a low IQ. E.g. poos on the deck in front of someone. Is immediately punished with direct relation to the poo on the deck. Next day: there's a poo on the deck. Lots of energy, she has caught lots of rodents and insects. Very nimble and fast. She is a very verbal dog and will grunt and growl to communicate. E.g. No you can't do that. Arooooo. No, no!! Gghh arrooogh. Okay fine I give up. She also wags her tail incessantly. In terms of physical traits, she has very soft fur that forms gentle ringlets. She has the mottled brown and white pattern pictured. She also has really big droopy ears and a really long tongue. Current theory: she is poodle with some form of cavalier. Edit: sorry, cocker spaniel not cavalier!</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Thank you for this really in-depth response! Edit: I think why we didn't think she was a golden doodle was because our older dog is also a golden doodle and she's 22kg with the stature of a poodle, coarse-ish fully white curly hair, golden retriever triangle ears and is a generally very graceful and lithe dog. However on reflection I have friends who have a golden doodle and he has the same drop ears and soft curly hair as Maple. I think you're right in saying that there's a large variation in the definition of golden doodle as it is difficult to predict exactly what traits the puppy will take on when mixing the two breeds.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>bro, what's your health care like? extreme pain often puts you higher up on the triage priority in hospitals. it can't hurt to even call your emergency line and get in contact with a medical professional! they can talk you through these kinds of feverish sickness. I've had really bad stomach cramps once and turns out I needed to do a number 2 - maybe try take some laxatives or something? hope you get better, best wishes from Australia (your abs may be on fire, but my entire country is!) anyways hopefully when you see this you're feeling better</TEXT>

All the wildfires are really doing in terms of global warming is contributing more - the average temperature in Australia was 42 degrees Celsius (about 107 Fahrenheit) the other day.

    <TEXT>No eating upstairs when I was younger. My parents didn't want me getting crumbs in my bed and leaving food around in my room to attract cockroaches and mold. I was at a friend's in what must have been year 5 and we made toasties (crumbs galore) and popcorn (easiest food to scatter everywhere) and we took them upstairs and I was just mind blown. But I found that I still liked the rule. To be fair I am a serial cup hoarder, there's always a few cups in my room - but I still eat downstairs 7 years down the line. My sister doesn't share my respect for cleanliness however, and her room always stinks of whatever food she ate last. Also, fruit cores and skins in her waste paper basket. Yuck. So much for the rule!</TEXT>

    <TEXT>The food blanket! I grew up in hard wood floor house so I'd never experienced this. I was at my friends when we were like 13 and his mum put down a blanket over the carpet in front of the tv before we had dinner and watched a Harry Potter movie. I was perplexed. I didn't ask why. I sat and began dinner and watched as my dear friend scattered about 10% of his rice and 5% of his peas onto the blanket. Ah. He was still subject to the food blanket last time I visited.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I had a simular experience, except instead of monetary issues my mother had keen ideas about diet. So we never kept anything sugary apart from like fruit in the pantry or fridge. Not even sugary cereal. We still don't buy butter (too fatty), but an olive oil composite. I was shocked when I went to friends houses and they offered me a few Maltesers or some shapes just from the pantry. Didn't have to beg, or even ask mum. Oh and I would always make toast with waaaay too much butter on it because it's way tastier than olive oil spread (guess what, the fat adds flavour!).</TEXT>

    <TEXT>My mother is an artist and she produces a lot of human anatomy focused art. I got very used to the human body very quickly, sculptures of nude women, paintings of men and their genitalia barely covered (the funniest part I got to learn when I got a bit older is all the men in her paintings are exes or models or both) and paintings of oddly yonic flowers all around the house. I filtered this all out and often forgot the significance of what her paintings depict. So I new have friends over and they'd be like "oh that's hang on is that of my gosh" and I'd go "Yeah that's her nipples and there's her vagina- it's a weird perspective, I know. She's in this painting too you can see her better" and they were just sooo confused by how comfortable I was with it all! Your story of your parent's no censorship rule kind of related to this so I thought I'd share.</TEXT>

Boy. We grew up differently! Whenever sex scenes came on mum would make a point to say that they're not using protection and not explicitly talking about consent, which one should do as well as use protection or at least clarify they didn't have STDs. And then I'd annoy her by correcting her by saying it's STIs now (we covered it in school when I was 13) and she still does roll her eyes whenever I correct her!</TEXT>

    <TEXT>When we went out to restaurants they called it a treat to order bubbly water. It was smart because I would get so hyped about bubbly water that they never had to deal with me drinking super sugary drinks like fanta and coca cola. I still go bonkers for some bubbly water and lemon. Same thing with ice cream. When we went to parks and such mum would only buy the lemonade icy pole (she refused to buy magnums or golden gaytimes or anything icecreamy). Which meant I thought what is basically a block of frozen lemon cordial was a treat instead of a hunk of sugary, fatty dairy. Again, can't go wrong with a lemonade icy pole to those day. So refreshing.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Crazy train*. I was in a town about 100km south of where I attend school, and I was switching trains to go to an even smaller X town. As I arrive at my platform (which was easy, it's a rural train station there's just two sides to the one platform), I see someone I very vaguely recognise. I work in retail so I figure maybe I'm just going nuts and I'm accidentally recognising a customer. I not so subtly give them weird looks and walk directly towards them. I do that "hey, hello I'm not crazy for staring I just think I recognise you" face as I approach. I go, "Hey, I think I now you." They go, "Um, I'm not sure if I know you?" "Oh nevermind you're just a dead ringer for a guy I knew a few years ago." "Oh really?" "Did you uh, perchance go to X school? And um, have a role in the Y school play?" "Why, yes I did! And my sister went to Y school. You know, _well known girl_." "Oh my gosh I was crew for that play! Where are you headed?" "The town after X town." Anyways we chatted on the train ride to X town. It was crazy that I recognised someone so long after knowing them so briefly and met them in such an unlikely place.</TEXT>

I have a number of her pieces hanging in my room, and have gone on to purchase art of my own which does feature nudity because I appreciate the effeminate form aesthetically. I am very comfortable with my body as a result of this exposure and also her "it's just a human body" approach to nudity. I'm definitely a lot less funny about nudity than my peers, in health class people would always got squeamish about the drawings of nude people but I didn't bat an eye!</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I love the fit!!! The only bad-ish comment I have is that the bag strap could cover Sailor Moon's face in certain positions which is big sad. However I love the exact colour match of socks and hat (cleverly demonstrated by a bent knee position which hikes up the pants naturally) as it encourages the viewer to engage with the hat and then be drawn over your whole outfit down to the matching socks. I like how the use of a lot of jewellery would otherwise push the outfit to a more effeminate angle but due to the chunky mafia-esque nature of the rings and rapper style chains it actually pushes a powerful masculine vibe. Plus you can't go wrong with some Nike Air Forces. Also the use of analogous colours to make the yellow and green pop is great - especially with the contrasting pastel moment of the mint and pink.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Dear reader, I hope you're having a nice day or night. I would like to be considered by you for the moderator of r/page as I am very inspired and motivated to make this an excellent sub. My idea? It was hard picking just a few but here are my best. 1. *Beautiful pages*. E.g. just finished an assignment and the opening page has perfectly even paragraphs, nice type face and colour coordinated headings and sub-headings. 2. *Inspiring pages*. E.g. a page from a book which you find has good quotes and a great message. 3. *Silly pages*. E.g. a page in the newspaper with a dramatic title that sounds absurd. To further encourage community I was thinking of holding a fortnightly event where a page is posted and people have to do something creative with the page - these are then submitted competition style and the community gets to vote on the best page! E.g. Photoshop it, create blackout poetry, print it out and turn it into origami. There could also be competitions for the most aesthetic pages. Competitors are supplied with an article and images and can compete to make the prettiest article page. In terms of leadership and moderation - I consider myself a good candidate as I am school prefect (think Percy Weasley except no magic) and have experience ideating and then executing my plans. I am also good at thinking in an unbiased manner and operating in the interests of the majority instead of what I want. So, dearest reader, I hope you will consider me for moderator of r/page.

    <TEXT>Love the double hip realness. Edit: I looked more closely and my second impression is that your style reminds me a lot of a friend's. She does lots of oil paintings of the human body on large canvases with exaggerated shadow colours and larger strokes like you. I love this style and love this work! I read that this has taken you a while, so I encourage you to keep it up.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Ask them about themselves, their lives. Be an active listener, comment politely that "you know what they mean", or "that happens to me too". People will walk away thinking, _wow they're really interesting_ because we are innately egoists. Keep asking things until you find something in common. What are you watching right now? Turns out you're both watching the same anime. Now you can both pop off about how good it is together! Etc. Note: another part of active listening is remembering things e.g. they lived in Ohio until they were 14, they hate dark chocolate. Being able to bring these things up later shows that you care enough about them to remember. Also, ask about their outfit. Especially if the outfit looks really good - chances are a lot of their personality was channelled into it and they can talk a lot about it.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>People are naturally egoists, it's a coping mechanism. If you think about it, we read books which are in the first person because the character and their thoughts are interesting. How quickly would you put down a first person which just followed the regular daily motions of a person's life second by second? Almost instantly. However, our reality is exactly that. A first person following the thoughts and experiences of a very regular person. In order to not be driven to depression, boredom and downright insanity we must, as a coping mechanism, believe we are more interesting than we are. So in summary, yes it is okay to romanticize oneself because otherwise you would go bonkers.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I think you should argue that you don't want to associate with anyone who would give you hate for having pierced ears in this day and age. The only institution which might not hire you because you're wearing studs would be like law because they're really old fashioned. Additionally, the perk of piercings over stretching holes is that you can take them out and it's not obvious you have them. My father works in finance and he wears his earring on casual Friday's. Plus you're 17! I know for a fact that any job you're getting hired for at 17 could not careless what colour your hair is, what tats you have, let alone harmless stud piercings in the lower lobe. Also, life hack, have their signature saved on your computer as an image and you can always paste it in word onto the digital form... Plus you can tell them that they might as well let you do it and if they hate it then you just take the piercings out and they grow over. Piercings gone! But you are left with the piercings scar. Tactics wise: write her an email. Use neutral, respectful language. Send it to her mid morning but after she has had a coffee. Now she has the whole day to think about your points before you get home. Chances are she will read the whole email, and you get to make all your points without her cutting you off. Offer to pay for the piercing yourself or do her some favours. Emphasise how grateful you will be if she lets you. Ultimately, parents want their kids to be happy (even if they don't act like it) so stress that it is something that you will really value. Good luck my man. Edit: syntax</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Cut a corner off a skin coloured bandaid and put it over. Stops you from picking it and getting infected as well. Please do not pop pimples! When you pop them you force half the puss down further into your skin (and hit nerves which is why it hurts) and half of the puss comes up to the surface and you wipe it away. The puss you have forced down damages the skin and increases chance of infection and scarring. You can pick it open with a tweezer and "pick out" the puss, but don't push it down.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Take notes after your initiation sessions. Chances are you will forget the door code, the order which you're supposed to put things away, where the pay slips are, when the roster gets updated, which number to call for which manager. Also, yes - don't be afraid to ask "dumb" questions. Everyone knows what it was like to be the new person. Also it's really easy to make friends with the other new people as you can talk about your struggles together. Also be careful what habits you pick up. Many people develop lazy habits that you go, oh that's smart, and you copy them to save time. But then the manager comes around and tells you both off for breaking WHS or whatever. Try to be friendly and don't believe what everyone says. If someone says, oh Paris is a bitch. Be like okay, be wary of Paris but chances are Paris isn't a bitch she just turned in paperwork late once and pissed off said person. Being aware of workplace dynamics is more useful than how to do your job best, sometimes! E.g. don't bring up the Monday morning shift with person X because they hate it. Or, person Y hates doing Z job (which you don't mind) so try switch with them- and then they will favour you.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Yes it is very manageable! Dogs really only need a few things: food, water, a place to defecate/urinate, and somewhere to be walked. I recon a small dog is a good start - as they do everything on a smaller scale. I personally love sausage dogs (however they are quite social so often you get two). Please avoid pugs because they have lots of medical issues and it will cost you a lot. I personally love animals and will do anything to accommodate them in my life. However, I asked my sister and she says that it s not very practical to have a dog during college as you have a very irregular lifestyle, you don't have the time and you're not mature enough to look after yourself- let alone another being. You could also consider lower maintenance animals which you can still cuddle like some cats, guinea pigs, rats, rabbits, birds (to an extent), snakes (if you're game), lizards. So tldr: dogs take time and organisation - if you don't have that don't do it. Good luck!</TEXT>

E.g. swimming in the cold surf, jumping off cliffs into water, laughing at stuff which isn't funny and asking for your opinion way too much. The sober people felt obligated to watch them and watch their stuff so it didn't get stolen. The main point of the party became the sober people tagging along to every drunk activity - we weren't impressed and honestly it put a lot of us off drinking. Another one which may have been the first was a play after party so all the actors got drunk and all the crew basically stayed sober. Again the sober people chatted, ate pizza, danced and the drunk people went around giggling, falling into sober convos, trying to kiss people, dancing terribly, hugging randoms and ultimately having a sober person nanny them in the bathroom.</TEXT>

Prenups are especially important if one partner is going to inherit a lot of old family money, land and stocks and the other partner doesn't have much - because prenups guarantee the old money stays in the family and doesn't go to the partner.</TEXT>

Because no matter how mature you are for a 22 year old guy there's no way you can match the maturity of a 47 year old woman. So if you're not connecting mentally then where are you connecting? Additionally she has had you cut off all of your friends and family. This is a toxic move no matter the age and a massive red flag. No, it isn't very healthy, sadly.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Talk. To. Your. Support. Network. Mum, dad, sister, brother, aunty, uncle, friends, cousins, teachers, family friends - anyone who knows you personally. Don't be afraid to open up to them because they love and care about you and will want to help you. There's also services like kidshelpline and byeondblue which you can call and they will talk to you and give advice. Try not to get in your own head, take a breather and try to put it in perspective. There are so many happy adults I know who did shit in school, so missing one or two classes is nothing. And for God's sake cling onto your friends, or at least send like a mass text saying you're not feeling great so they know why you're ghosting them. Chances are, they're your friends and want to help. I wish you best of luck.

    <TEXT>I'm not sure where you are but in Australia when a Wuhan and some general China planes land, Australian authorities test all people on the flight. People who are suspected are then either quarantined by the government or put under "house arrest". I imagine it works similarly in other countries. The rules are even stricter for schools because children have weaker immune systems. So if there was even a chance your mate had it he would be detained right now.</TEXT>

    <DATE>2020-02-01 03:54:18</DATE>
    <TEXT>Story time. I was obsessively going through my bank account details on my online banking app this morning. I found a transaction for the 14th of January for 20 dollars and I was like, hey, that doesn't make sense. I was on a camp at the time and didn't buy anything online or go to the shops. Plus the vendor was called FastDealsToday. Very sus. Anyways I go through my internet history anyways to make sure I didn't forget about impulse buying some dice online. Sure enough my history for that day is just Netflix. Olay something very fishy is happening. Anyways I ring my bank and they confirm that the vendor is from overseas and they aren't registered. My bank has blocked my card so they can't take more money. There's a small chance the security team can get back my money but chances are that 20 bucks is gone forever. Tldr: an overseas vendor put through an unauthorised transaction and stole my money. My advice? *Be careful which websites you buy from!* Obviously I bought something online in the past somewhere kind of sus (I think it was deal hippo) and they sold my bank acc details.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>You're not ugly. You have decent proportions and just need better glasses. Also let mother nature do her thing, getting rid of some more baby fat and making your jaw more prominent. Late bloomer? However, it is always healthy to express your concerns than it is to bottle them up. Especially for guys (I assume you're he/him) it can be hard to talk about insecurities. If you're really concerned about picking up chicks then talk to your mates who are so successful! A lot of women, (including myself) find confidence more attractive than the actual look of guy (especially if he isn't ugly to begin with). So try working on your confidence man. Girls can sense from a mile off guys like you who worry about their appearance. Also, no one is judging you! We're all teenagers and too busy thinking ourselves. Also photo tip: good lighting and angle works _wonders_. Anyways good luck with the marines, I know an adult which is an ex marine and he has lots of stories about how girls would froth over him in uniform ;) Edit: syntax</TEXT>

    <TEXT>go post this on a bisexual/lgbt+ advice sub - those people have been through coming out and I am sure have lots of advice. you are the person who knows yourself best, so trust your gut instinct when you feel that you are bi. in terms of your parents, i don't know them personally so idk how to approach this. my best bet would be to let them sleep on it - many people need to process things during sleep because it lets their subconscious figure it out. but definitely try to speak to them again in the morning, bcs letting it sit and fester won't work for any one. communication is key</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Depends on the age of the dog. If they're a young dog then a lump isn't concerning. Keep an eye on it and if it either stays the same size or shrinks slowly you're okay. However, if you've got an older dog then shrinking is still good but staying the same size could be a concern. If it starts causing pain responses when touched you should also be concerned because it is actively hurting your poor baby. But no pain response and it's alright according to above and vets advice then it's no harm. Additionally - a good question to ask doctors and vets alike is: is this really necessary? E.g. if they're pushing surgery ask whether there's alternatives.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Sister of an autistic girl - autistic girls on the most part do not fit the stereotype at all. They learn from an early age how to act like other girls and often fly under the radar. My sister is high functioning so she also wasn't noticed at school. She is loud, extroverted, she's a freshman now and popular with a number of girls in different groups. She is very true to herself, never lets anyone shut her down and she has personality for days. She wears heels to her psychologist appointments and absolutely works it. Her style is crop tops and black, the sides of her head are a number one and she is a bold punk ass bitch. It just goes to show that not everyone with autism is the same, and you really can't just fit them into a box. If you saw her walking down the street, would you think she was autistic? Heeeeeell no.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>My friend carries around his favourite blue dice everywhere with him in a black dice bag. One day he leaves class to go to the bathroom, which also includes him browsing reddit for 5 to 10 minutes. Here is my window of opportunity. His bag is unattended. I pull out my shitty purple dice and replace his blue ones inside the black bag. There's no way of telling the difference if you just pick up the bag. Knowing how much he uses his dice I recon it will take maybe 2 hours for him to figure it out. He would find me at lunch and switch them back. But nooo. This man gets all the way home before using his dice. I happen to be busy and my phone is on silent. I come back to _five_ missed calls on my phone. The rodeo show is about to start. I also have _several_ frantic incoherent text messages from him. I call him. He picks up in -0.05 seconds. I DONT KNOW WHERE MY DICE AREEEEEE What's wrong? MY FUCK DICE THEY'RE AAAHHH *upset sobbing and cursing* I have never felt so powerful in my life.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Yes it is true that men _do_ work more dangerous jobs, work higher paying jobs and don't take maternal leave. The whole point of gender equality (aka feminism) is that more women work construction, more women work in engineering and are doctors (hence closing the pay gap) and that more men take maternity leave to support their working wives. I understand that you are very solid in your opinions, so I'm not going to try change them. But I do encourage you to try lend an ear and at least listen to people who advocate for gender equality (aka feminists). You may surprise yourself with how much you agree with. Or you may think it's bullshit and that's okay too. Have a wonderful day/night and I wish you the best of luck expanding your mindset. :)</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Have you ever considered *why* women choose or end up in lower paying fields? Society has an ingrained rules into boys and girls from a young age what jobs are "for men" and what jobs are "for women". Women should become teachers, nurses, designers, accountants, retail, child care, receptionists, cooks, clerks, cleaners, etc. Men should become doctors, scientists, surgeons, bankers, engineers, builders, firefighters, police, etc. These archaic allocations of jobs where created in a patriarchal society - and unintentionally still force women into those fields. I'm not saying this was on purpose, but as you can see the "female" jobs do on average pay less. The ideals of gender equality (aka feminism) is to create a society in which the divide of men and women in all of these fields is roughly even. Of course there is always going to be a divide in some fields like child care (where women due to hormones like estrogen and progesterone have a stronger maternal instinct and better suited to the job) and construction (where men due to hormones like testosterone are better suited to lifting and physical work of the job). But overall, achieving an average equal split in all fields of work will then eliminate the issue of different levels of income. Anyways, if you read all of that then thank you for taking the time to read my opinion.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I had "sleep paralysis except I wasn't paralysed" which I later learned is just hallucinating straight after waking up. I was on malaria meds for travelling to asia which can cause "intense dreams" but I guess mine stepped the fuck up. I was sharing my hotel room with girls I'll call Jamie and Emma. I was dreaming and I felt strange so I woke up. I look around the room and there's a FUCKING SKELETON PHAZING THROUGH THE WALL OH GOD OH FUCK. I am screaming "There's a fucking skeleton! Aaaaahhh help fuck aaahhh!" Whilst pressing myself against the wall behind me and drawing my bedcovers up to protect my body. Jamie is woken up and scrambles over to me. "What's wrong? Whats going on? Are you okay?" I see her but the skeleton is still FUCKING FLOATING OVER TO ME OH GOD ITS EYES ARE A GLOWING RED ALARM CLOCK ITS ALL MISTY AND ITS COMING FOR ME. I'm sobbing, "Jamie help me help me there's a skeleton. It's eyes are fuck. The skeleton it's coming." "There's no skeleton? What are you on about? It's okay it's not real." "ITS FUCKING REAL JAMIE ITS COMING FOR MEEEEEEEE." I'm sobbing and screaming. The skeleton is only a meter away now. I'm frozen in place out of fear. "You're okay. You're okay. There's no skeleton." "No no no no fuck it's just there out of the wall. Right there Jamie." I point to the skeleton which is very fucking real. "Look away from it goddamit." I'm crying and eventually I tear my eyes away from it and then it's gone. We both go back to bed and get surpringly good sleep after that. Oh you thought I forgot about Emma? Nononono. Emma slept through this whole thing. Despite us all being in the same room and me screaming until my throat was raw. Think I traumatised Jamie though!</TEXT>

So small dogs like malts and Chihuahuas would be bred to have basically none because they are designed to my comfy lap dogs. Guard dogs like Rottweiler and even terriers would have really forward ones which are really pointy. Running dogs like huskies and greyhounds again we would breed the antlers out so there's less weight and they can run faster.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Student here. I 100% agree with this rant. I graduate this year from high school (oh my god I am so excited to finish). Your point about parents supporting kids over teachers reminded me of a John Mulaney bit about child rights when he was a kid. The essence of the bit is that his parents would trust any adult over his own word when he was little, sometimes to his demise. My thought is that now that his generation of kids are having kids who are hitting primary through to tertiary education you can see the compensation that the parents are making. The parents unintentionally believe their kids over teachers and other adults because that's how they wish they were treated as kids. I just asked my dad if he hypothetically had plagiarized a school assignment - which side his parents would take? He said without a doubt they would take the teachers side and give him ass whooping. I am feeling this change myself as well. I mean some of this might be "senioritis" but I'll tell a little story of my life in high school. In year 7 I was terrified of teachers and any grade above me. Especially the 11s and 12s, they were so tall and mature and smart - how could I possibly compare to that?? I was scared shitless of pissing off teachers, I respected them too much. One time I got ahead of myself and a teacher told me to be quiet (not even in an angry way) and I almost cried I felt so bad about making them annoyed. As I have progressed the grades I have definitely not lost respect for my teachers, if anything I have gained it. They're my friends too now. Here comes the part which applies to the rant. In year 11 and 12 I have had and do have leadership positions (e.g. prefect) and I have felt a change in younger years attitudes. The year 7s are no longer scared of seniors. We can't get them to do any house events or community work because they don't give a damn about our opinions or the community. I looked at year 7 attendance history to house events and it has almost halved. Last year we had two year 7s for one event, when usually said event is most popular with year 7 and there's 15 or more always attending. It's just sad. Anyways, I just wanted to corroborate your experience as a teacher from a students view. Also that's my view from a private all girls school. I don't mean to stereotype but I assume it would be even worse at a public school. I have friends at public schools and the poor teachers should have their own psychologists.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>None of them are mammals. Mammals are warm blooded, vertebrates, covered in _hair_ and gestate children inside the mother before giving birth and nourishing them with milk. The key point being hair. Natural colours for hair range from orange, black, grey, white, brown to red. That's why you see mammals with this colouring (and hence lack of blue) as they all have hair. Birds don't have hair, they have feathers which are coloured in a completely different way. Same with fish scales and insects shells.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Very clear and big signs stating the rules. If you argue the rules, then we have the right to fine you for being a nuisance also displayed in bold. That will shut people up. Most people argue because they want to save money - so a sign saying you will get fined quickly shuts down their only motivator, to gain or save money. E.g. you aren't allowed to try on underpants before buying them for hygiene reasons. I have had to have very long arguments with women who say that if they buy the wrong size without trying them on then it's a waste of money. Well if I told them they could get fined for arguing the big rules they would shut up and just buy the medium.</TEXT>

There's this homeless guy who rants about how modern language doesn't include feeling or emotion and that Shakespeare through his language instructs us on how to feel, think and treat others. And that the common population's disconnect with him and his feeling language allows them to act callously towards others. Hence this new age of treating others like shit. We must reconnect with classic composers like Shakespeare to rediscover our humanity.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I went on a community service trip overseas for two weeks. When I came back everyone's parents were there waiting at the gate. All the girls (around the ages of 16, including me at the time) hugged their parents and got on with catching up. My mum was nowhere to be seen. Of course she was late. She's always late. Feeling neglected, I hung out with my friends and their parents until mum arrived. I couldn't call her because we didn't take our phones on the trip. I felt seriously annoyed with her. Like I was ready to give her a lecture on being on time. Then I spot her frizzy hair through the crowd. I just break down sobbing, full messy crying. "Mum! I fucking missed you so much!" "I missed you too, honey." "I love you so much awmygod *crying noises*" "I love you too." All that anger and annoyance towards her was just completely washed away by just the sight of my mum. I love her so fucking much and I really felt it in that moment. I forget that sometimes when I'm angry at her - so this post was a good opportunity for reflection. Thank you</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I said I'd PM but you can just reply to this :) hooe youre doing okay 9 hrs later. stress is an ancient response built into our bodies to help us survive. For example we will feel stressed if we anticipate conflict because that allowed us to fight our competitors well. However that expresses itself now as anticipating teachers being annoyed about late or bad work and hence feeling stressed. How did our ancestors get over this stress? Well they fought their competitors. Obviously we can't just have a wrestling match with our teachers, so you need to find another physical outlet for the adrenaline and increased blood flow. So go for a walk, run, weights, yoga, etc. There's also a mental method to get over stress. This requires more commitment because it only works if you do it daily. Meditation, mindfulness and reflection. The headspace app has several guided daily reflections and meditations which you can listen to. I personally use this app to get to sleep. Mindfulness is a little different, it's about being very present and filling your mind with only sensations. Just sitting there and noting every sensation you feel. Google these three methods or YouTube them e.g. "guided stress meditation". Also what is really important is to be aware that you are becoming overly stressed. Often if you realise a few minutes ahead of time that your heart is beating fast, you've got sweaty palms, got a headache - you can actively stop thinking and so something else to clam down while you still can. Good luck</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Firstly, I will concede that she should have never said that. But I understand why she did. She naturally wants her children to succeed in life - and sadly not being conventionally good looking will put you a step behind everyone else. Her concern over your looks came from a good place, she recognises society's reaction to your appearance and feels a maternal need to compare you to others and make sure you do well compared to them. This is how humanity survived in society thus far. So there's a very big probability that in her eyes, she loves your appearance. She has brought you up, spent every living moment loving you. She probably finds your appearance very endearing and lovable. But she knows inside that just because she loves you, not everyone else in society will feel the same initial reaction. That is what probably drove her to say that. Plus you were at her mother's funeral. People feel and say things they don't mean when that upset. I'm very sorry you ever had to hear her say that, but know that there's a very small chance that she genuinely meant it. Edit: grammar</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Gotta find yourself a woman with an off centre cervix, which means that if your penis goes in parallel to her body you are less likely to hit her cervix because it is off to one side. Additionally, the cervix changes height throughout the month. It's lowest (closest to the vaginal opening) during menstruation. And highest (which will be most comfortable for large penised men and women receiving them) during ovulation. Essentially its more comfortable to have sex when women are most likely to get pregnant, thanks to evolution. Aim to have sex 10 to 14 days before she is due for her period that's when the cervix is highest. But she's also ovulating so be extra careful.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>USA - after a google of products they turned up as US stuff. A decent amount of milk, so a kid is definitely in the play here. However, there are at least 4 cans of this alcoholic lemonade (the website asked if I was 21+ not 18+ so definitely a US product). Any person mature enough to have a child doesn't still have a "hard lemonade" as their drink of choice. So this means that either a 21+ member of the family still lives at home and they have another fridge for wines, etc or this is a college fridge with residents who are still addicted to milk. Excessive amounts of condiments for a multitude of different cuisines... not many clues there. Leaning towards family fridge with a 21+ still living at home due to the excessive use of Tupperware and the proudly made cake waiting for consumption. Also, what appears to be birthday candles are in there too - which would help lean towards the family fridge line. Tupperware containing about 1.5 servings suggests that food is produced in bulk (for a family) and there are always extras - so middle class. Someone also likes making bread (*Fleischmann's* Yeast) - definitely leaning towards the family of four model. Two parents in their mid 50's and two children one in the late teens and one early 20s. The quantities of fruit and left over salad also suggest this. Both parents work full time. Someone has a passion for baking.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I am always aware of my spelling errors - it really bugs me being wrong. But I am terrible. Just terrible. At pronouncing words. I was a super super big book worm as a kid so I would read words before I ever heard them. E.g. epitome, porcelain, lingerie (linger + eee) is how I still say it in my head before consciously correcting. I learnt I was saying it wrong one day in Year 8 when I pointed out a lingerie store and my friends just stopped and went what the fresh hell did you just say. I didn #8217;t know it was French! So I appreciate people correcting me on my pronunciation for sure. I don #8217;t want to go around sounding like a bogan!</TEXT>

Also roaccutane could seriously save your skin from any more scarring, worth investigation! I'm on the other side my skin is too dry and I have to moisturise with Vaseline moisturiser to keep it at the right level. Also I can highly recommend literally ANY cetaphil skin product.

But most teens its less of an escapism thing and more of a social thing - which is not a good reason to be smoking. I still stand by it being bad for your brain tho :) But I'm not shitting on you doing it specifically because now I understand why. Hope your home life gets better!</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Very well put. People feel bad for having bad thoughts but there's a part of us which naturally explores these dark things inside rather than outside so that we never actually have to do those dark things and harm people. It's actually a very well developed social trait which allows us to function in society. Mad Max and all the dystopian/horror fiction explore what happens when society breaks down and we allow those dark thoughts to realise. It's terrible. Which is exactly why it is so okay to have bad thoughts as long as they stay interior like you said. Better in than out in this case.  #8203; Edit: however dark thoughts relating to self harm should be taken very seriously! Please see someone if that is occurring regularly.</TEXT>

E.g. following a wikihow to use run to find appdata and install mods, etc. Not that hard but shows initiative.

    <TEXT>Firstly, all that "hourglass" "pear" shape stuff is nonsense! Everyone's body is totally unique. However, generally speaking men's bone and hip shape as I am sure you are aware is just straight up and down, like a "celery stick". However, a lot of women struggle with this bone structure too. So there is a lot of fashion out there designed for women with that straight up and down shape- which is perfect for you. Because you are both aiming for that classic "womanly" out, in, out shape. So you're not the only woman struggling with this issue! Secondly, presenting as a woman is a lot to do with body language. So if you stand like a construction worker in women's clothes, people are still gonna pick up those signals. So practice in the mirror presenting how you like. Also, women walk very differently to men. Observe next time you're in public how women sway their arms and place their feet - it's actually crazy how different it is. This is in part due to how musculature forms in women, resulting in a more delicate stance. Thirdly, now that we understand the basis - we can add the final layer!!! The actual clothes. There's a few methods involved. First, is to use "fit and flare" this emulates hips by basically having a dress which becomes loose at where your waist would be, hiding the fact that your body doesn't actually widen out into hips. Another beautiful casual look is flow vs. fit with pants and a top. Fitted jeans topped with a more flowy top works really well on multiple shapes. This is because it gives the eye a real body shape to observe, your gorgeous legs, and then the loose piece lends more to the imagination. The movement of the loose top hides what forms (Or lack there of) are sitting behind it. Fourth, dressing nicely in general is alllll about thoughtful accessories. Any put together woman takes an extra 5 minutes to accessorize and match her outfit. E.g. wearing a black and pink dress? Pink earrings. A black bangle. Or a silver necklace to add some shine. Or better yet, all three together! Good luck with your journey :) Edit. Spelling</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Everyone else telling you how they constantly receive texts and photos from Friend A about their suffering. E.g. receive photos of cutting, the scars, knives, bandages. They receive stories from Friend A about how they need surgery, and how they have nightmares and how they hate their parents. But you know that you are their closest friend and the deepest thing you've talked about together is the ocean... But behind your back she's telling people she's got manic depression, scoliosis from her school bag, sleep paralysis, phsyically abusive parents etc. It's very confusing because it feels like they're making stuff up to get attention from others. But they understand they if they try that BS with you that you'll drift away and then they'll be left with no one. Note: It has been confirmed that Friend A makes up 95% of what they say because the stories all heavily conflicted themselves. E.g. I was at the psychiatrist after school on Wednesday so I had to leave school early. But you person X bumped into you at the music rooms at 4? They have some form of anxiety but that is the only diagnosed condition.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>All these adults, they have small pleasures. A little doggie, a hobby, a favourite show, a special someone, a social group, events to look forward to, sport. I'm not an adult quite yet but I already exercise these things. I workout with my friend, I play dnd, I paint minis, I meditate, I edit media, I'm watching 3 shows which are currently releasing each week, I cosplay a tiny bit, I'm reading worm. All of these things are speckled throughout my month. I might do dnd once a month, supanova (cosplay) isn't until September! Supanova is an event to look forward to, give my life direction and momentum. That's how adults deal, they find the small pleasures to indulge in subtly. I'm so sorry that your life has lead you to the point were you are brought to tears. But know that a) you aren't the only one feeling this nihilistic insignificance b) there's plenty of ways to improve your life going forward. Also, it's not the actual hobbies that you find release in. It's that continual progress and growth that is so different to the corporate/school environment. Work is cyclical, the same schedule over and over. Reading a book isn't. It's an evolving experience which is different each time you go back to it. Doing physical hobbies like painting, writing, etc give that permanence to your progress, and they're different each time. There is no meaning found in hobbies, but rather a way to ground your life and have a permanent representation of your life moving forward. I suggest reading a book, The Colourless Tsukuru Tazaki and His years of pilgrimage. A beautiful book which is perfect for your questions and feelings.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Once came back to the hairdresser after about 2 or 3 months of mum just shaving the back of my head with the dog clippers whenever it got mullety. I told the hair dresser to just make the front short like it used to be. She told me that usually when people with short hair come back she can replicate the previous hair cut by looking at how much the back of the neck and side burns grew out to indicate the original cut length. A bit like a finger print. I told her about the dog clipper arrangement. She told me that was the equivalent of burning your finger prints off.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Think about the 5 minute rule. Often used in social situations. E.g. if you notice someone has some food on their cheek, you can fix that in less than 5 min, so tell them so they fix it. You've already left the house and think they look a bit fat in that top? Don't tell them. Just next time they go to put it on, encourage them not to. Now relating that back to this. Your crush has a boyfriend. There's no point telling her you like her because she's not going to dump her boyfriend for you. There's no 5 minutes fix. Sure if you we're close friends already a 5 minute convo would fix this. But it can't. Best thing to do? Wait it out. Maybe keep a diary of your feelings. Talk to your friends about a hypothetical girl maybe. Or bring it up in a party game where the mood is more fun. E.g. never have I ever had a crush on someone in a relationship? That opens up conversation about it. There's no harm in trying to go to the same things as her e.g. sports games and try a little talking there outside of school time. Good luck</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Driving up a steep road, between a parked ute and a solid 1.5 lanes on my right (in aus). A big range rover comes streaking down the road, so I gently curve more to the left to give him space, coming quite close myself to the parked ute. The rover screams past with less than 10cm space between us. I keep driving and don't react because when scary things happen like that I just go into function only mode, and I still don't feel scared when I think about it. But my dad was in the passenger and he was like "What the fuck he almost crashed into us! He legitimately almost crashed into us. The fucking wanker. Jesus christ. Fuck. You're so lucky. Fuck."</TEXT>

Ask nicely about how she's going, whether she's fully okay now, whether she's ready for a relationship. Communicate with her. Be open. Chances are she's happy to talk to.</TEXT>

When I was 5 I travelled to Japan with my mother, of course lamby went too. I was so scared about losing her that I would pack her back in my suitcase after every night I slept with her. She sits on my book case now.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I think there's a clear difference between liking to watch lunch club when they put up a video / laughing at memes referring to them and actively posting about them like he does. But the same goes for anything. One can listen and enjoy Lana Del Rey without being cringe. But posting nonstop and talking nonstop about her? Then the persons personality suffers. I think it is definitely a big issue of our generation that people base their whole personality off a whole genre or thing. I'm looking at you BNHA kids. There's just so much content available on one field that it's just too easy. Jschlatt and other YouTubers happen to produce masses of content - which is what makes it a) so easy to base your personality around them b) make liking them seem overrated.</TEXT>

However, I'm not sure what pricing is like and what 3,000 can get me. Notes on riding: I'm not a massive motorhead, I just like to go fast every now and then. Plus having a motor bike in Syndey for commuting is very useful. Thanks for any suggestions!</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I have a similar experience. My father is the atheist type who says "we mock children for having imaginary friends, then how come we don't mock Christians for having one too?" He just scoffs at me, but I think he ultimately doesn't mind. Why? Because he sees how much joy it brings me. He sees that I feel refreshed and happy - and ultimately that is what parents want for their children. I think if you make it clear to your parents just how beneficial practicing is for you - that they might attempt to see it an another light.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I do this regularly. It is very calming with the warm water, quiet, lack of visual stimulation. I leave the hallway light on and the bathroom door ajar to let light in. It also means my dogs can walk in and say hi if they want to. I also burn a candle for gentle olfactory engagement with my environment. But using a scented body wash (especially the lush ones) will have the same effect. Also, if it is a full moon the light coming through the window can be enough. If I can't leave the bathroom door open I will often turn on the yard lights instead and let those come through the window.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Had a similar experience. Definitely get those pronouns right! It's very validating. Also, if he's comfortable with it, tell other people to use the correct pronouns. Tell him that if he ever feels nervous telling someone which pronouns he prefers that you'll be there to back him up. Also, compliment his masculinity! If you notice a certain jumper makes him look super masc, tell him! If you notice he looks quite buff in a certain shirt, tell him! Trans people really struggle with dysphoria, so validating his appearance and reminding him that he is successfully presenting as male will feel so good for him. Edit: also get super comfortable with correcting people when they use his dead name.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>No, ignorance is bliss. If you know you're going to die in a year - that whole year becomes pointless. We all know we're going to die, that is what gives life meaning. We want to achieve things whilst we havw time on this earth. But knowing when? That removes your motivation. Some could argue that if you know you're going to die in 5 years you can make sure to do your bucket list before then, therefore keeping you motivated... to an extent. What happens when you run out of money and can't travel anymore. You have to take up a job and work towards saving enough to do more bucket listers. But people seem to do that already. The vague deadline which everyone works with is what give birth to savings like "live every day like it's your last". Teaching people to value the present moment, the day that they are living. Additionally, it is very depressing to know when you are going to die, cease to exist, kick the bucket, become 6 feet under. It adds a level of finality and predeterminism to your life that would lead you to question everything. Are you really an agent of your own destiny? Or is everything predetermined? If one can know when they are going to die, and they cannot change that, what really is the point? Also, knowing leads to over indulgence. If you know you're going to die in 3 months - why bother with a diet? Why bother keep healthy? You know you're going to go, so why not go out having lived everyday eating your favourite foods? People would disengage with basic self maintenance. A plus side of knowing: Hopefully quite a few people, their age will be high 80s when they pass. Most people live their lives assuming they will die when they are old, and take it easy. However this would have the opposite effect. People getting 80s and up would do crazy, life threatening stuff all the time because they know they can. Soon, their life would become a journey from joyride to adrenaline rush because they know they're invincible. Actually, it is occurring to me now that this would be the affect on most people, regardless of the number they get. This could be quite fun for some people, but for others it would lead to a life where they actually didn't achieve anything personal. They spent their whole life thrill seeking because they could, and now have no personal connection, no sense of self, no personality. But for others, knowing you die old could become a bug incentive to do well. Knowing you're going to die old gives you motivation to earn money so you're comfortable when retired. Gives them incentive to make lots of friends so they're not lonely. However, for those who get a low number - they could fall into a state, as mentioned before, of just thrill seeking because they don't have long. So knowing is a double edged sword. Now that I've written this response I think to myself - I wouldn't mind either. But I would want to live in a world where everybody knew if I was to know.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Into a spray bottle place: * 200 to 300 ml of moon water (I made some on the super moon with rain water especially for this spray) * Clear quartz (this crystal is water safe) * Lavender oil (chemist warehouse is having a sale for it right now fyi - 8 drops) * Tea tree oil (water soluble - around 2 tsp) * Rosemary (dried or fresh, I used dried because it's raining and I had dried on hand - 1 small sprig) * Optional: rose petals (I had a floral arrangement which was on the way out so I snagged a few) Now state your intent, I went with: "*Blessed be this water, help me cleanse my spirit and my mind through rejuvenation of my environment.* (place each ingredient in as you state each line if you wish) *Let this quartz keep this moon water charged, let this lavender oil lend peace and calm, let this tea tree oil keep the air fresh, let this rosemary help purify, and let these petals lend warmth.*" I then repeated the first line three times again, then gently swished the bottle to combine. The result is a very fresh smelling cleansing spray (I'm a very olfactory person, so trust me when I say it smells nice), which also looks very cool with the petals and rosemary floating in the opaque solution: [https://photos.app.goo.gl/NASHSrHerWVcnBQx5](https://photos.app.goo.gl/NASHSrHerWVcnBQx5) Enjoy  lt;3</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I received this maths question: as a part of your job as a farmer, you are planting pumpkin seeds to grow. Your buyer wants 400 pumpkins. Your pumpkin seeds are dodgy (but expensive) and have a 30% chance of failing to grow. How many seeds should you plant to maximise the amount of pumpkins you grow, but have less than a 4% chance of growing too many pumpkins? We are to make an excel spreadsheet to solve this problem. I think I have a working and correct [spreadsheet](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1xpHJ6RJKTegQPmP9EHQE3tn_JRCYXGqY) ( lt;= google drive link) but would someone be able to confirm I'm right? Thanks. Additional criteria: the excel spreadsheet must be "adaptable". E.g. If they change the question to 500 pumpkins, the formulas will still work (once I input 500 pumpkins into the "number of pumpkins" cell). Or if they change the probability of a seed failing to grow, etc.</TEXT>

To play devil's advocate real quick: often girls are better at expressing their feelings than boys (due to society saying its okay for girls to express their feelings, but not boys, hence girls get more practice). So it could be that the girl's posts are written better and evoke more feeling, resulting in more help. *However*, I do actually agree with you more than my counter point. I think its actually more of a minor factor which contributes to this trend.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>You just said what we were all thinking... damn! There is a very fine line between being realistic and being mean. Like if someone with bad facial proportions asked you, am I ugly? You would say, I don't think you are - you have a beautiful smile, etc. There's no point being mean to them, they know they're objectively ugly - so no need to remind them. The same can be applied to overweight people. If they ask you, do I look gross? You're not going to say yes, because they're aware of their obesity and how it looks, no point being mean about it. This is the perspective people are coming from. I can't hurt to say you think they look nice because they're aware of how they actually look. It is also nice to know that some people think you look nice, even if you still know you objectively don't. I think the point at which it becomes an issue is when people with actual health issues start to believe all the positive messages, and then don't do anything to improve themselves because of it. Edit: however chances are that the majority of unhealthy people when told they look good think it was nice of someone to say that, but know they would look even better if they improved their health. Anyway good point and thank you for having the balls to say it.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>For a film project I was filming a time lapse of the view out of the bus window (public transport). I wasn't filming people inside the bus, just the view. This woman (mid 20s, belly button piercing showing, airpods still in) asks me "Are you filming your ride home?" I say, "Yeah, for a film project." She nods and goes back to her phone. As I get off the bus she says something mildly unintelligible like "goth" or "good" or possibly "got It?" But doesn't make eye contact with me. I'm not sure if she was pissed off by my filming or not? Tldr: I'm looking for your opinion as to whether me filming out the bus window would annoy you.</TEXT>

    <DATE>2020-03-20 06:26:07</DATE>
    <TEXT>They're a highly oriented tactile person, with physical affirmation definitely being their major love language. However we go to different schools. So it is highly recommended we don't touch (I work in service so there's a high chance I pick it up and pass it to them and therefore their entire school) so that our schools remain separate corona virus risk environments. We saw each other this afternoon and they told me how much it pained them to not hug and touch me. I'm a far more actions and words person, so the ban on touching isn't taking such a toll on me. We've been together for almost 2 years so I'm not afraid not touching will distance us because we've been through periods of not seeing each other due to exams, etc before. It's more of an issue of seeing each other but not touching which I think hurts more for them. What do you recommend? I'm very inexperienced compared to the majority of the people on this sub, so I'd really appreciate your advice. Side note: we were both 15 when we started dating, I'm not sure how people are about 14 year olds dating so I thought I'd just add that :)</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Yeah I sent a long text about my concerns, and we talked it out - just being really honest. We're now at the stage in Australia where socializing is completely banned - so I can't even spend time distanced with them which is a shame. But I think it's less hard now (ironically) because you cannot see anyone apart from family in your home now. Because before you could still hangout and be normal with all your friends, so it was painful that you couldn't be normal with your partner. But now that socializing is abnormal/non existent for everyone it's less bad. We just make sure to stay in touch over text even if its just a quick "heard this song and thought of you". It's definitely very sweet, but I can't wait to see them again IRL. I'm not very big on texting, I prefer to see everyone in person. I've always been the person that if I receive big news or know something awesome, I'll happily wait a day to see them in person and tell them then. So that's why I think the brief texts showing affection and loving thought works well for me, because I find meaningful text conversation quite stilted. In fact that long text I sent, I actually sent photos of it written out on paper!</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I hate tampons but not for the reason you'd expect. I'm an avid menstrual cups user. They're my lifeblood (excuse the bad pun). Menstrual cups are every thing good about tampons: can go swimming, no thick pad in your underwear, less likely to leak (my cup after 6 months atleast of use has only leaked once because I had a crazy heavy flow and didn't put it in right), don't have to change them every 2 or 3 hours like pads. In fact I haven't used a pad this year at all because you can leave a menstrual cup in for up to 12 hours, so I use it when I sleep (which you can't do with tampons). Yay no more bed leaks! I also feel like my cramps are less intense when I use the cup, but this might be a placebo affect. I literally forget I'm on my period when I use the cup because you clean it in the morning like 7 am, forget about it all day (There's no gross tampon pee string either) and then clean it 7pm, rinse and repeat (another bad pun sorry)! So yeah, I hate tampons too.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>"Milch" is german, my gut is telling me maybe west germany. Lots of milk and yoghurt - so you're not lactose intolerant (or at least not so severely that it's stopping you), which puts you in a younger age bracket (below 25). Again, lots of condiments which suggests you eat take out and reheat it often. Other ingredients like the abundance of eggs, curry paste, pesto suggests you are however, a capable cook. I'm guessing living alone post grad woman, but entertains guests often - not sure about current COVID rules in germany about how many people are allowed to visit though, so maybe this is incorrect.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>From what I recall from a friend's coming out, he started a new school year and requested his new name over his dead one in class and when his friends asked, "why the change?" he informed us of his trans identity and notified us of his new accompanying pronouns. Well, I'm very close to him so I'd known for a while but that's how it operated for the just good friends. However, I remember how nerve wracking it was and I think you're really strong for giving coming out serious consideration. In my experience, aussie teens and millenials are super accepting and quite curious because they want to be informed and educated and respectful.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I felt similarly a few months ago when I was 100% sure I was straight  #8482;, but I just let myself think about my feelings without purposefully blocking them out or "mentally slapping myself" and I slowly came to understand after a few months of consciously thinking about it that I am bi. It all started for me with the simple thought, "Am I bi?" - so I think in a way maybe you've already started your journey. Notably about the Christian thing - there are a number of churches and groups who support LGBTQ+, so don't instantly assume the worst. Anyways, good luck, don't stress. Sometimes this stuff just needs to stew for a few months, even years before you can actively put a label on it and that's fine. I'm happy for you that your family is supportive!</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Congrats on coming out that takes guts. I don't have any advice to give as I am an inexperienced teen but I wanted to acknowledge your feelings and say I respect you for staying true to yourself. I have met many people who regret no coming out sooner or not embracing their identity sooner, and were glad that they eventually came out to their partners. Give her time I guess, don't expect her to be able to jump onto the 100% onboard side straight (sorry, bi) away. Remind her how you care deeply for her, and that your bi nature doesn't invalidate your sexual history with her at all - because I think many straight people fear that. But yeah, time helps for processing. Realising now that I have given advice, probably not that good, so sorry! Good luck in the future, I hope you have an irl support network you are also talking to - as they will have better insight into how your wife is feeling.</TEXT>
