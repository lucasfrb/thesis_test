    <TEXT>Ok I said I would post my first med purchase yesterday, but I completely smoked out yesterday there was no way I was gonna pull that one off.. First purchase from Trulieve... STARDAWG (HYBRID)- I give this a 8 out of 10, 22.6% THC NORTHERN HASH (INDICA) - I give it a 6 out of 10 honestly, only 15.7 % THC WHITE BUFFALO (SATIVA) - 7 out of 10, I expected alot better from this strain. also got a 400mg cartridge of Sunshine Sativa. The selection wasnt as good as I was looking for, but I'm assuming they re stock often.</TEXT>

I give it a 10, and that's the first 10 I've given so far, I've made a rule to never give a 10 unless its absolutely necessary.... Its at 20% THC, I'll say this.... I run 4 businesses, so I'm always looking for a good Sativa, right now I feel like I can run the entire country. This one is top Sativa for me (for now  #128523;)</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I wish people would see what Trump is actually doing, if you read the cares act you will discover that Trump is actually transferring ALL of our debt back into the Federal Reserve Bank which is NOT owned by United States. You talk about the top 1%? Those are the people who OWN the Federal Reserve Bank. Rothschilds, Vanderbilt's, Rockafellers, etc... Soon you will see what Trump has done, the Fed Reserve Bank has been slaving Americans since 1972 and is the REAL reason why we are in so much debt. Look at your dollar Bill's, it says Federal Reserve Note at the top, which means they owe US money, that dollar is suppose to be backed by gold. They have been stealing from us since 1972, the stimulus package was an alternative way to get our money back to the people. By the end of Trumps next term we will be back to the gold standard... just wait and see... Q</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I know this is a bit late but I had to chime in.... when you say Trump has been involved in illegal activity then why isn't he is prison? Even the biggest of billionaires end up in prison eventually no matter how big their lawyers are.... right? So why didnt the impeachment happen? What happened to the Russia collusion? Or the muller report? Why has Trump not been found guilty after his accusers spent 40 million dollars of YOUR tax money searching for evidence??? Little do you know.... you've been hoodwinked! Just like I was.... Everything you stated is actually what the democrats have done.... who started the KKK? Democrats. Who is for abortion? Democrats. Legalize gay marriage? Democrats. Welfare and Food Stamps? Democrats. Done absolutely nothing for the hood? Democrats. Victimization tactics? DEMOCRATS. By the way, I'm a 35 year old black male BORN in Washington DC. I know what's REALLY going on, and it's not what you see on tv, when he says FAKE NEWS, it really is....</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Well, i use to do the same thing..... I would smoke weed to deal with problems.... but I realized smoking weed is suppose to be more chill... your suppose to be relaxing... So i flipped it... now I only smoke when I've dealt with my problems for the day.... example... i got pulled over the other day, cop made me leave my car, took my license, had to go to dmv and do all kinds of paperwork back and forth... I waited until I got all that completed, THEN I smoked, much more enjoyable... deal with your problems first... then smoke to celebrate, relax, and enjoy your accomplishment.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Wow, interesting people dont know when the Sabbath is... The Hebrew #160;Sabbath, the seventh #160;day #160;of the week, is often spoken of loosely as "Saturday" but in the Hebrew calendar a #160;day #160;begins at sunset and not at midnight. The #160;Sabbath #160;therefore coincides with what is now commonly identified as Friday sunset to Saturday night when three stars are visible in the night sky. GOOGLE IT</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Sunday was another work day in the Roman Empire. On March 7, 321, however, Roman Emperor Constantine I issued a civil decree making Sunday a day of rest from labor, stating: All judges and city people and the craftsmen shall rest upon the venerable day of the sun. Constantine changed it from Saturday to Sunday, this was done to violate one of the 10 commandments. "Observe the Sabbath, and keep it holy" But if your observing the wrong day then your not observing the Sabbath, all tricks from satan.</TEXT>
