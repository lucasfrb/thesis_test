    <TITLE>Today I masturbated watching VR porn. Forget everything, you should try it</TITLE>
    <DATE>2020-07-05 14:20:57</DATE>
    <TEXT>It's not expensive, but your phone must have a gyroscope. Then you can buy the Google Cardboard Headset for 15 #8364;. Easy as that. You should all try it with long videos (~30/40 minutes) so that you are fully immersed in the thing, idk how it would feel with shorter ones. Nice experience, try it, there's a bunch of other things you can do with the vr headset when you're done hahahah</TEXT>

    <TITLE>[M19] A friend of mine just sent me a pic of a self-portrait of hers where she is half naked. How should I interpret it?</TITLE>
    <DATE>2020-07-16 22:52:18</DATE>
    <TEXT>So she's a friend with which I usually talk by message, she lives in a town almost one hour apart from mine so we rarely meet. We occasionally talk about our passions and our life in general. Her main passion is drawing so from time to time she sends me images of her sketches, they're usually pencil drawings of girls and/or boys in different situations (nothing sexual). Today we were talking about stuff when she decided to share her last drawing, which was a pencil drawing of her, from the belly button up, with no clothes, just a bra. I first didn't think about it and said that it was great as her other works are, but now I wonder if it's an actual sing of interest or just a casual thing. I like her, and if she wants to try to be more than friends I surely wouldn't mind, but I don't have a crush on her or anything so I'm afraid of making moves that could ruin our friendship, since I'm also cool if we remain like this. So what do you guys think?</TEXT>

    <TITLE>I intentionally missed the opportunity to have sex with a girl and three years later I'm still a virgin</TITLE>
    <DATE>2020-07-21 09:13:38</DATE>
    <TEXT>I'm 19, still virgin, I was 16 at the time. There was this friend of mine, same age as me at the time, who liked me, and I kinda liked her back but not that much. We were really close so we used to talk about lots of topics, including from tome to time even sex. One day when we were texting about how we saw our "first time": she said that she just needed a trusted person that she knew well. She said that I could have been the right person to have sex with the first time, so she asked me, hypothetically, what I thought about it. I declined because I didn't think it was the right thing, I was scared that that could have ruined our relationship and I was scared of having sex in general I guess, I thought I wasn't ready to (plus, we weren't boyfriend and girlfriend or anything like that and I thought it was important to make it to sex step by step). I trusted her, I knew she wasn't just begging for a dick, but I didn't feel like it. One day (like months later) she was at my place after school (she changed school so we didn't see each other often) and after we had lunch she put her hands on my shoulder and said "let's fuck!" And then she started to laugh and hugged me. Three years later we aren't close anymore for completely unrelated reasons, I'm 19 and I'm still a virgin. God if I could turn back time to those days I surely wouldn't miss the opportunity. I was such an idiot, and she even kinda told me that in non-offensive ways which I was too stupid to understand. So now after crush posted a selfie with a boy at the sea I feel kinda bad and I thought I'd share some of my past non-experiences on Reddit TL;DR Three years ago a girl told me that she wanted to have sex with me but I declined cause I didn't feel like it. Now I'm still a virgin and I surely would have accepted the offer</TEXT>

    <TEXT>[This way](https://youtu.be/_xJ2DNZBI4I). Here it's clearly pronounced with English accent, but it's how italians pronounce it. It's kinda the same way of tear-uh-me-sue. The only difference is that we also put the accent on the final u when we write it, so it becomes "tiramis #249;" (from tira=pull + mi=me + s #249;=up)</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Being able to vote is something that we have because others fought for it. If you can express a preference you have to do it, there's no logical reason for not doing that, even if you don't like any of the parties you can pick the less worse.

    <TEXT>Because you have a choice. Voting is not about saying that you like one party and they represent you totally, it's choosing what in your opinion is the best alternative for your country. You don't have to feel totally represented by who you vote. If I was offer you an ice cream made of either chocolate or vanilla, but your favourite flavour is strawberry, would you choose the one that you prefer or would you refuse to have the ice cream at all? I think the first option is the most logical one.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Ok you're kind right about this one, even if I would still vote fir the less worse candidate. I personally think that electing the government (or the President in this case) with direct majoritarian elections is not a good way of doing it. Like, as you said, at a certain point if the projections are too much unbalanced you're not really motivated to vote. I think people should only elect the parliament, and then the parties with most votes form the government. This way even if you know that your party is not gonna win your vote still matters for their presence in the parliament and so is not useless. So yeah, probably it's not only the people's fault if they don't go to the urns. Still I think they should anyway</TEXT>

    <TEXT>We were at a birthday right after lockdown ended here in Italy. To respect social distancing we all sat distanced in groups of five on different tables. So my crush was next to me, but I couldn't manage to really carry on a conversation with her, (I asked some questions but the thing did not go anywhere) so we just talked about whatever was on the mind of the other people at our table. Then at a certain point a guy1 goes to take a drink at the bar, and guy2 (who sat next to guy1) asks my crush something about Netflix. She answered and then moved to the place where guy1 sat and she remained there to talk with guy2 even after guy1 returned. And I was there in front of them like "fuck!"</TEXT>

Then I think that art is the one thing through which a man can realise itself, but this is just a personal thought.</TEXT>

    <TITLE>Do singers tend to sing in just intonation or in the regular 12TET?</TITLE>
    <DATE>2020-09-01 08:45:25</DATE>
    <TEXT>So some days ago I saw [this](https://youtu.be/lvmzgVtZtUQ) video on YouTube and I learned about the differences between just intonation and the standard 12 tone equal temperament (which I kinda knew already but I didn't really understand). So ok, we tune pianos, guitars, basses and lots of other instruments in order to respect the frequency ratios of 12tet, but what about the the "fretless" instruments? I'm talking about voices, but also violins, cellos, trombones, and so on. When people play these instruments do they tend to play (even if not being aware of it) in just intonation, as it feels more natural than 12tet? For example, if I ask a singer to sing me a major scale, will (s)he sing the approximated notes of 12tet or not? P.S. Is this something that is talked about in singing (or other instruments) lessons? As a drummer and guitarist I've never heard of it before seeing that video on YouTube</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Really interesting! But how can you be sure when you play the leading tone in Gmaj7 a few cents higher that you still sound, you know, in tune with the other instruments? Is it just having a well trained ear? Oh and, of course, as long as it sounds good nobody cares, it was just curiosity, not that I need to know it for any particular reason other than that hahaha</TEXT>

    <TITLE>I just dreamed that I kept "vomiting" headphones from my left ear, probably the creepiest dream of my life.</TITLE>
    <DATE>2020-09-10 07:55:11</DATE>
    <TEXT>This just happened, I'll write everything I remember It all begins at home, when I discover that my parents refused to go to dinner to the owner of house (the one you pay the rent to) who had come to visit us and somehow turned out to be George Lucas (yes, the guy who invented star wars). I love Star Wars so I was super pissed at my parents for refusi that offer, so I went in another room, put headphones on and started listening to music ( Imagine by John Lennon was the song). I initially used small headphones, but midway in the song I tried to switch to bigger ones, the ones that cover your ear. Turns out, after I take the left small headphone off to wear the bigger one I still feel it in my ear. So I take it off again. And again. At that point I had like six pairs of headphones, and my father cutted some cable with the hand, not sure what, but it helped. I went to bed and it continued to happen. I remember I tried to wake myself up as I know it was a dream but I couldn't, so I convinced myself that that was real life. Somehow now I was at a park with friends (I don't remember who they were, they acted as f they were friends of mine). I kept vomiting headphones from my left ear. Slowly. I could feel them under my skin and after they were there in my ear, and the skin was intact. Eventually, I started vomiting from my left ear other things like little wheels and those things you put on the top of toothbrushes. A friend of mine was storing them all in his backpack, even if from a certain point on, they stated being bloody. I was convinced I would have had my left ear removed from my body with an operation. Eventually, we saw a dog that was "just like me" but I don't remember why. So at a certain point I somehow woke up. My left ear was bended on itself and it felt just like a how I felt the headphones in my dreams. Also, my right arm was totally numb for ten seconds as I slept on it. Probably craziest shit ever happened to me in a dream.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I think the way of getting out of this is finding someone that appreciates you exactly as you are, I don't mean specifically a boyfriend, but whoever happens to be. I (M19) personally have one friend that I know since we were three years old, we share a lot of interests and having someone that through my life always appreciated me has helped me build my confidence and self esteem (not that I would say that I have much of those but you got the point) The issue with that is that it has to come from a different place than the one you're in right now, if you usually go out with some friends, it's difficult one of them could be that person, as (s)he already knows you in another way. Btw, I don't think it's uncommon to feel like that when you go out with friends, I do feel like I'm not having fun even if I am most of the time, which is why I rarely do it and only if I'm invited</TEXT>

If I like watching Netflix with my family more than going out with friends to smoke and basically do nothing that interests me, I'll stay at home. There's no problem with it. Experience all, but choose what you like. When I think about that I always tell me that there's no reason to feel like missing out on something I don't like doing. Everyone is different, and "most usual" shouldn't mean "normal"</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Right! Car chargers need to be more and more distributed on the territory. My mum wanted to buy an hybrid car some months ago but where we live (suburbs of Florence, one of the biggest italian cities!) the closest recharge station is three kms away, so she had to buy a diesel one. Car chargers are sometimes that definitely need a massive strengthening.</TEXT>

Like, in Italy I'd be able to drive a scooter with the licence for driving the car, but (rightly, because our country doesn't make sense lol) in other countries I can't. And everytime I travel with my parents we have to check what the rules are in different states. We definitely need a standard for this.</TEXT>

Giving that I never went there by bike I didn't even consider that, I just thought about cities hahaha (And also I think you're probably used to see more bike lanes than us as you're from Germany, and you're used to an higher standard) Anyway, for what I remember, most of the roads there aren't very crowded, are they? It's worth mentioning that the supervision on historical towns here is really enforced, so it's not easy to modify the roads in order to put there a bike lane and so many administrations may decide for not doing. Anyway I'm not sure this is the case, just an hypothesis Hope you're enjoying your trip!</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I'll start saying that I love this feature (if it's a feature and not a bug that occurred only to me), and this is not a complaint at all I started a career with Fiorentina and Ribery (age 37) was marked as "will retire at the end of the season" right from the start of the first season, with his contract expiring at the end of it. After some great performances by him in the first 9 matches he sent me a message saying that he wanted to discuss his new contract, and I was like "suuuuure Fifa, that's a bug, another one, I can't negotiate a contract with a player that is retiring". And, instead, I could. I offered him two more years of contract and at the end of it he was no longer marked as "will retire at the end of the season". Did this happen to anybody else?</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I think the great filter is the ability of a civilization (like humanity) to change its mentality of thinking short term into thinking long term. We've needed to think short term for many centuries, because we had to survive, just like we needed to produce energy by fossil fuels in order to have the technology to produce it with green methods now. That's the same thing from my point of view. We are not wrong, we just have to change, like a child becomes a teenager and then an adult, changing attitudes and behaviours. Still, nobody would expect a child to act like an adult. So yeah, I'm basically saying that our civilization is a teenager that doesn't know what to do after high school</TEXT>

    <TEXT>That's an amazing question. I think we should change from hours into something else that better represents a certain situation. Like, if Earth has a day of 24 hours with twelve of light we could use two numbers to express the approximate situation of somewhere. Like, let's say sun rises at 6am, then 7am would be 8,3-1 with 8,3 indicating the actual percentage of day with the sun visible in the sky that already passed, and 50 indicating the ratio between the night and the day (if they're equal, it's one). This would be cool because we could have an universal way of describing timezones without doing it, but we'll still need a way to measure time, not just to indicate it, but that could also be fixed as we already have an "universal" definition of a second, in relationship to something about atoms, I don't remember what but I'm sure it's universal. This way we could add a third number to our 8,3-1 thing indicating how fast the first term varies. Like, let's take seconds as unit, we have 86400 seconds in a day, so 86,4 hundreds 8,3-1-86,4 For anything else needed for communication between different systems, we could just use one planet as a reference that has the most simple and functional "1-86,4" thing, like "1-100" or something like that. This way we'd indicate time differently from how we measure it, and if we put relativity in the box, I think this system would hold itself together better than our current system. In total honesty I don't know, but it's been fun thinking about it. Has science fiction given any answers or ideas?</TEXT>

I get to know her because of some casual situation, then if she behaves like a normal human being (aka doesn't ignore me one moment later) I start falling for her in the next few days, and when we meet again I'm nervous and stuff. It's pathetic, mainly because I know that they meet new people very often, unlike me, so I'm just one random guy for them (as I should be) while for me they are the chosen ones that didn't forget about my existence one day after our brief talk. How do I get out of this vicious cycle? Anybody else has this problem like me?</TEXT>
