    <TITLE>Update 09.08.2013 (1.33.27.0)</TITLE>
    <DATE>2013-08-09 07:43:01</DATE>
    <TEXT>**UPD2: The below is a bug already hotfixed.** **UPD: A ridiculously major overlooked feature - AB/HB no longer have ground forces markers, either displayed ingame or on the map. They only appear at 500 to 800m. Not even the AT team are sure if it's a bug or intended feature to make the future tanks' lives easier.** Patchnote that the english forum didn't get for whatever reason. Source - [click](http://forum.warthunder.ru/index.php?/topic/56379-obnovlenie-09082013-133270/) - Fixed the engine sound disappearing - Fixed FMBC Mk1 description - Fixed the effect of Hispano modifications - Added new AB map - "Cliff of black diggers" *(is kind of a mystery - can someone clarify how it's translated? "black diggers" is basically WW2 black archeologists in Russia fyi)* - Fixed various graphical inaccuracies in F8F, F9F, P-47 and some other planes - Fixed crash in Japanese localisation - Settings and FM of De Havilland DH.100 Vampire FB.Mk.5 updated - Fixed Browning 7.7mm scattering - Added planes P-51 D-30 Mustang and gift P-51 D-30 Mustang D-20 NA - Fixed fuselage aerodynamics (corrected exxaggerated head drag) - A6M2, A6M2n, A6M3, A6M3 mod 22, A6M5, B-25J, Boomerang Mk I\II, D3A1, F1M2, Fw-190 D12, Ki-49, N1K2, p-63 A-10, OS2U Kingfisher, TBF, wirraway, BTD - Added Do-217 modifications - Added planes P-51D-30 and P-51D-20 *(this one is repeated twice)* - Fixed F-80 air brakes - Fixed F2A3 wing and flaps aerodynamics (flaps worked the other way around) - Completely updated P-26 FM (it's still not 100% historically accurate, but should be much closer) - Fixed base characteristics in the F8F description - Fixed modification requirements of MiG-15, Spitfire 9\16 - various other small inaccuracies and bugs fixed</TEXT>

    <TEXT>*(Pointed out on the Russian forum in a related discussion thread)* On [this](http://warthunder.com/upload/image/for%20the%20news/news_gamescom.png) image from the ["War Thunder at Gamescom 2013!"](http://warthunder.com/en/news/239/current/) article the Panther tank to the right has a ~~seemingly random~~ *appears to be a "very well-known vehicle 421 from 11.Panzer division" [source](http://planetarmor.com/forums/showthread.php?t=8182), but that still doesn't quite explain why it would appear on this image while all other vehicles can't be identified* - why would an image of what's supposed to be a generic tank have some sort of insignia that's quite easy to miss at a first glance, which most readers did? - 421 on the turret. The Gamescom expo is August 21 to August 25, so may 421 hint at some WT-related presentation (the PS4 demo either with or without the ground forces reveal) August 21, 4PM CET?</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Just a quick question to decide whether I should get around to reading this even-larger-than-the-original sidefic. My concerns are in the later acts combat and the general storyline development will stray from survivalism as appropriate to the Equestrian Wasteland and go full MUH MCGUFFIN battles that, while being fine as a concept, don't really belong to postapocalypse, thanks. From what I've picked up trying to avoid spoilers, this is at least partially the case.</TEXT>

Note the planes being priced at certain amounts of *something* (F4U-1a is 17000, F4u-1d is 23000 etc.) - that's it. It's also probably not like WoT where it's a ridiculously small percentage (5% or so) - a screenshot I can't recall a source of (sorry) suggests more like a 1:3 ratio.</TEXT>

You'll find a special promo code in the magazine, by activating which you'll receive 200 GE on your WT account, a unique Igromaniya decal and - most importantly! - an exclusive Soviet fighter, LaGG-3 23 development series, which you can't get in any other way. Details in latest number.  gt; Note: promo code available only in the physical version. The quote sums it up. The plane itself's probably nothing special, yet another LaGG-3 version (in fact, the only difference from 11 series appears to be a minor tail construction change and a new prop) that may or may not even have a unique camo, but hey, gonna collect 'em all. Also, the magazine is priced at 200 to 300 RUB (~$6-9), depending on the retailer.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>What I think was actually happening is Russian nationalists assaulting and huminiating a man because they thought he was a "banderovets" or something. - As pointed out below - happened in Donetsk, where the RS presence is nearing zero. - Attackers spoke perfect Russian, again, not typical of RS the Ukrainian nationalists at all. - One bit especially screams "separatists". As translated below: "Hoodie: Where do you live? You live in Ukraine, asshole?! Man: I live in Donetsk. Hoodie: ineligible or maybe spoken in Ukrainian @ 0:33, sounds like "What country?" Man: Ukraine. Hoodie: Ukraine? Man: Yes. Hoodie: [You are] from Russia, you bitch." The translation didn't make it clear, but the logical chain here is "where you're from? - Donetsk - and that is... - Ukraine - *slap* no shit it's Russia", which, again, would make zero sense for a RS member to say. - Also, forcing the man to say "Glory to Ukraine" can be interpreted as "you're a banderovets, say this banderovets thing lelelel". **EDIT:** If you downvoted this, do point out what's the flaw in the reasoning. This is actually a genuine request and not some "downboats prove I'm right, eat this!" bragging.</TEXT>

None of them turned out to be true besides the ones that just so happened to coincide with 19th-20th February or earlier assault waves. Now there's "RUSSIAN MASSIVE FALSE FLAG INVASION CONFIRMED TOMORROW" from the pro-Western side (including one from otherwise trustworthy Dmitriy Tumchyk) and, on the other hand, "NAZI JUNTA ATTACK OPERATION CONFIRMED TOMORROW" from the pro-Russian protesters. What do you know, one of latter happened to coincide with the actual assault.

It's not an evacuation though, we tell everyone to hide in cellars and whatnot, not evacuate - because, one, we don't want too many people on the streets, and, two, so that people hide small children - the more, the better...

    <TEXT>The game's actually pretty inconsistent about how rebel pursuit works. Most of the events suggest this is probably the case, but the actual game mechanic has them consistently capture any sector - and when you're late you always get spotted because there's a metric ton of Rebels in the area, not because someone deliberately tracks you, so why would they even bother with tracking if they'll be heading in your general direction anyway? Then again, if the game went for this approach the pursuit mechanic would instead be a timer (REBELS DETECTED YOU, ARRIVING IN TWO MINUTES, DISREGARD STRATEGY RUSH THE BATTLE LIKE CRAZY) so eh.</TEXT>

    <TEXT> gt; Translation needed - last night's events have shown Kyiv govt. doesn't want peaceful approach (Slavyansk/Kramatorsk/Odessa victims); ergo, governor "declares" martial law - full mobilization of male population for the "South-East army" - all non-Luhansk army and police should leave the region until 6PM; Luhansk army and police should arrive at (what is the separatist HQ again, ODA?) and pledge allegiance to the "Luhansk People's Republic", otherwise they'll be declared traitors and enemy of the people and, quoting, "wartime measures" will be taken against them - curfew declared from 23:00 to 6:00 - **all political parties and organisations banned**, RS declared unlawful, "wartime measures" will be taken against them - factories should work as previously, any attempts to stop them will be viewed as provocation enemy of the people wartime measures blah blah - **"pro-Nazi" channels to be banned** - a final remark "we will defend the land from Nazis, our primary goal is Kyiv" - journalist: "a Nazi said today that there won't be an assault on Luhansk and therefore the Internal Security building will be freed, is it true?" - "it's a lie, we won't go for talks with the Kievan junta, no talks and attempts to reach an agreement will happen" *[wait, but didn't you claim it was them who didn't want to in the first paragraph?]* - "what do you mean, our primary goal is Kyiv?" - "we won't wait until we're caught and burnt, **a plan to attack Kyiv is in development**" - *[holy shit that's an unintelligible question]* "it's just that, as far as I know, the majority of the region ... *(doesn't support federalism? doesn't support the attack plan? doesn't want to enlist? no idea)*" - "yes, but if the army - one funded by our money - will come and burn us, naturally we'll come to Kyiv and "ask" why this is happening" - "we don't make anyone take up arms by force" - "I was in Slovyansk two weeks ago, and we were given a paper... *[unintelligible, something about journalists?]* ...anyway, the curfew and martial law, how are you going to implement it?" - "we'll ask for help from the police to establish patrolling" - offscreen voice asks journalists to "perform accreditation" so that they could work (as in, be employed) with them tl;dr #justpeacefulprotesterthings</TEXT>

    <TEXT>...uh, OP? This isn't to be taken seriously. I *almost* thought it was until I've reached the "Odessa creates databases..." part and it quickly became clear that "Odessa" is merely pro-Russian teenagers doxxing people who disagree with them and then acting like they're pr0 haxx0rs nevr 4giv nevr 4get for pulling publically avaliable info from some social network. All the "mob violence Odessa isn't Ukraine blah blah" parts are just some ultraviolent wet dreams of theirs. The edge has just been lost in translation. Really, even the "US SEAL gorilla warfare" copypasta may sound like a serious threat when translated (can confirm, just tried to translate it to Ukrainian).</TEXT>

Also, there wasn't much doubt that the protesters were local citizens to begin with, it's Russian involvement with separatist *high command* that's disputed - and hasn't yet been verified / debunked by any independent source (not counting constant stream of dubious SBU leaks / "nope what are you talking about" Russian reactions).</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Not sure about Albania/China/Cuba/Mexico, but with the USSR the chief reason for eliminating religion was Marxist ideology, plain and simple. (One can also argue that in the early 20th century Christianity in particular was persecuted because of the strong pro-Csar opposition that was still present up until WW2 - see Russian Liberation Army - and was strongly tied in with the Orthodox Church, so obviously bolsheviks wouldn't want a strong presence of that). "Economic reasons"? Frankly, I don't see how persecution of a large part of the populace would economically benefit the state. Do elaborate.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Graphics - 9. Nice jungle aesthetic, good effects all around. Optimization is fine, some bugs present, but nothing a trip to PCGamingWiki can't fix. Gameplay - 8. Stealth is decent if a little streamlined, a guns-blazing approach to things also works fine. However, the hunting segments, while unique, just feel grindy near the endgame, and the side quests are mostly not worth it. Story - 7. Amazing iconic villains and nice island-dwelling supporting characters, but the main character and his friends are just a bloody annoyance and the plot feels really incoherent (horrors of slavery and rape - whoops, cut to burning weed fields while a dubstep soundtrack kicks in) Multiplayer - 2. It's just so dead. Don't bother with the DLC/deluxe, it's just some junk for the (dead) multiplayer, four animal reskins, a rifle and some unbelievably bad missions.</TEXT>

Most games don't lock you out because you have so and so RAM anymore (well, besides CoD: Ghosts that does it for no apparent reason), they just play at sub30FPS - and various ulra-low graphics mods might actually bring that to even more playability. Anyhow, "looking the game up" in system requirements lab and the like isn't really that reliable anymore. Get the free demo and buy the game if it works fine at everything to low.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I'd get the game, but since /u/Nyss apparently did it already, here's a list of nice things to get along with it instead: - [FTLEditor](http://sourceforge.net/projects/ftleditor/) - every now and then FTL save files just die a horrible, corrupted death. This handy tool can help you recover should this happen (alternatively, to unlock that elusive secret cruiser or just to instantly unlock everything ever if that's your thing) - [FTL: Captain's Edition](http://www.ftlgame.com/forum/viewtopic.php?f=11 amp;t=15663) - a content overhaul mod. Comes with some vanity gameplay mechanics like morality and trading, new weapons, new ship classes, enviromental hazards, sector types, **triples** the number of random events, and adds Discord to the crewmember name generator. Don't actually play it until you get the hang of the main game though. - Also, an addon to Captain's Edition called Infinite Loot adds a Borderlands-esque system of prefix-based (Fast-firing/Broken/Mil-spec/Incendiary etc.) weaponry customization. - And another one, Endless Space, removes the 8-sector limit, making the game an infinite sandbox. - [Better Planets And Backgrouns](http://www.ftlgame.com/forum/viewtopic.php?f=11 amp;t=9241) - HD texture pack. A must-have since, while some of the background screens like asteroid fields are amazing, most are mediocre and nebulae actually pissed off a friend so much he abandoned the game straight up.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>It does, actually. Or do they also have a slavery plugin that would obviously lead to all kinds of controversial things and in general a kind of community that advocates, well, slavery? Other things that make you worse than them include brigading every post of this modder team (and this comment chain, and this very comment probably) since early 2013, and in general what appears to be a toxic newbie-unfriendly community built on null and void internet reputation. Here's a quick example from the "cringe" sub-subreddit. [A "newfriend" gets hit by the slavery plugin](http://www.reddit.com/r/Civcraft/comments/29vhsc/ok_here_we_go_pearled_for_literally_no_reason/) - judging by the slaver's story the only reason for this was some /u/SethBacon 's e-authoritah:  gt;So I went to the Brimstone rail, and I pearled him because and I quote, "I am wanted by SethBacon." Apparently the slave is somehow the guilty one (no real reason for this - besides, obviously, the previously mentioned e-authoritah being invoked - appears to be given in the thread, notably a few confirmation bias "whatever, OP, you're probably wrong because this guy's high-profile" comments pop up *before* the full story is even revealed) and too gets brigaded. How friendly and welcoming.</TEXT>

    <TEXT> gt;Since you're already pearled they can't do anything to force you to work, even when you're logged on. You could just stay in the end and chill if you want. Yep, that's an option. Hell, you could at any point just say "eh, screw this" and logout forever - but if everyone did this the prison system would kind of be obsolete, wouldn't it? Because, surprise surprise, people actually want to continue playing on a server they presumably invested some time in.  gt;Secondly, it's supposed to be used to pay off reparations -- if you stole crap and weren't able to return it, it's a faster method of working for someone to pay off the 20d or whatever that you owe them in order to get released. Two paragraphs ago you claimed it's an optional aspect and not the point of the plugin, now you praise it because it's such a convenient way of doing forced labor. Uh...  gt;The shotbow players are the ones who [...] "Oh, but they are/were actually players of a rival network (that sucks) so we don't really hold responsibility". Nope, Scotsman fallacy - they could have migrated from Club Penguin for all I care, in this context they're nothing but Civcraft players (and apparently were reasonably active, owning a prominent (infamous?) faction).  gt;Then he goes to another city, says he is wanted by a well known player, **and further states that he is planning on attacking Brimstone after gathering resources. He comes across as a threat to any sane person, and is thus imprisoned** until SB can be contacted. [Except... no.] (http://www.reddit.com/r/Civcraft/comments/29vhsc/ok_here_we_go_pearled_for_literally_no_reason/ciow7oi) That wasn't the real reason, as claimed by the slaver/pearler:  gt;So I went to the Brimstone rail, and I pearled him because and I quote, "I am wanted by SethBacon." Yes, the pearlee *did* appear to throw some threats at this Bacon personage, but only the pearler's actual reason (that - again -was being dictated solely by AUTHORITAH) matters in this context. Also: IMO, he's perfectly justified to vent at people who oh so calmly and politely imprisoned him for entirely arbitrary reasons. But that's pretty subjective.</TEXT>

    <TEXT> gt;You need to spend more time in the Civcraft community if you think that we advocate slavery, because on almost a server wide level, we don't. People who use pearls for slavery purposes get taken down fairly quick. Doubtful. Even the neighbouring comment claims it's, quote, "supposed to be used to pay off reparations". And, sure enough, [a quick search suggests](http://www.reddit.com/r/Civcraft/comments/24455i/a_question_about_slavery/) only select factions/players ban the practice and it's actually pretty common:  gt;Yes, there is nothing that says you cannot force someone to do manual labor as part of reparations if you so choose. What the rules were against was the sexual harassment. [](/sp)  gt;If you pearl someone legally, you can make them work for their reparations. That has been a normal and long-term form of "prison labor" that could also be classified as "slavery." It's probably best if you just don't call them slaves... [](/sp)  gt;The whole idea of the prisonpearl is that you can punish people with pearls. Forced labor is often used for a debt to be repaid. And so on, and so forth.  gt;Did you even read the thread? Ghastily created that situation himself, no one else caused that but him. Oh, obviously without his questionable actions none of this would have happened. It's the "pearler's" line of thought that's the problem:  gt;So I went to the Brimstone rail, and I pearled him because and I quote, "I am wanted by SethBacon."</TEXT>

    <TEXT>BNW includes GnK gameplay enhancements (religion, espionage, 100 unit HP rather than 10 etc.) and some additions of its own (tourism, ideologies, world congress etc.), but not GnK civs, which are:  gt;Netherlands  gt;Celts  gt;Maya  gt;Carthage  gt;Byzantium  gt;The Huns  gt;Austria  gt;Ethiopia  gt;Sweden Do get the complete edition though. Minor DLC scenarios / civs range from decent to god-tier and are required by a bunch of mods. Map packs are eh, think of them as a bonus since the complete edition is much, much cheaper than purchasing stuff individually anyway.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Extremely late reply, sorry. Yes, just the civs and, AFAIK, the scenarios. (Into the Renaissance + Fall of Rome + Empires of the Smoky Skies) Is it worth $5? Probably - being official, the civs are pretty nicely balanced (most of these come up as "slightly better than average" on various tier lists and such), come with 3D leader screens and so forth, so they are generally fun to play. Not to mention quite a lot of mods require BNW *and* GnK to begin with, and should you get into multiplayer not owning every civ can be problematic.</TEXT>

    <TEXT> gt; unless you can provide some serious evidence against it [Source code for the diplomacy AI.](https://github.com/Gedemon/Civ5-DLL/blob/master/CvGameCoreDLL_Expansion1/CvDiplomacyAI.cpp) (Lots of text, may cause considerable PC lag) How the AI's likelihood to declare war (against another AI or a human) is actually calculated (ctrl+f MAJOR_CIV_APPROACH_WAR): - Base number depends on AI war bias (more for warmongers) - (line) 2970: add various amounts depending on base opinion (add more if opinion is lower) - 3024 and onward: add various amounts for denouncements, broken promises, tribute taken from friendly CS - 3323: multiply by  gt;1 if the AI is likely to win (WAR_PROJECTION_GOOD, WAR_PROJECTION_VERY_GOOD),  lt;1 otherwise - 3375: multiply by 1.6 if the player is a "reckless expander" - 3387: multiply by 1.25 if someone is already at war with the player and the AI might as well bandwagon - 3414: multiply by 1.15 if the player is a neighbor, multiply by  lt;1 if they are far or distant - 3447: multiply by 0.65 if less than 25 turns since peace treaty signed - 3473: add 1000 (this should pretty much guarantee a DoW) if the AI agreed to go to a cooperative war against the player - 3513: scratch all that and reset to 0 if on the same team - 3527: if human player, multiply by a certain amount based on player difficulty level (doesn't show up in the code but the actual values are 0 for Settler, 0.75 for Chieftain, 0.85 for Warlord, 1 for anything higher [source](http://www.civfanatics.com/civ5/difficulties)) So actually, yes, it's not *that* dependent on the military strength only - but it's not calculated the same way as ArbitraryVictoryScore(tm) either.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>You're still not getting it. Unlike keys/codes, there's no possible origin for Steam gifts but Steam itself. (Usually they get **legitimately** bought on a sale, in a cheaper region that is still ROW, or both - that's what the reseller profits from.) From Steam's POV there's zero functional difference between a gift received free of charge or one you paid for. While the origin is traceable, the **reason** for you being gifted it is not, which makes revoking a gift just because you paid for it elsewhere impossible. Alternatively, scratch all that and explain why [these](http://www.reddit.com/r/SteamGameSwap/search?q=paypal amp;sort=new amp;restrict_sr=on amp;t=al) cases of selling Steam Gifts didn't get anyone banned or any game revoked.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>- The Sierra Madre casino has a little locked area reachable by a series of jumps from the floor above it - Getting to the Puesta del Sol Ruined Building requires jumping from a rooftop to a balcony - And of course there's the absurdly complex area just before the final vault with 6 or 7 speakers that has quite a lot of jumping between support beams to reach a safe spot of some sort ...well, that makes half a dozen jumps, in a single DLC only, wonky and frustrating more than anything.

    <TEXT> gt;every of those games performed poorly didn't they? DA:I:  gt;According to Electronic Arts' fiscal 2015 third quarter earnings report, Dragon Age: Inquisition is the most successful launch in BioWare history based on units sold. Lords of the Fallen:  gt;Tyminski also said that sales for Lords of the Fallen, which released in October 2014, have topped "over 900,000 units" and that the game was "definitely a good start for the new IP". FIFA 15 **(4.0 Metacritic user score)**:  gt;But the number two spot in the fall race was captured by EA #8217;s FIFA 15, which VGChartz currently has pegged at 14.3 million copies sold globally. It #8217;s far and away the best-selling sports game of the season. Battlefield: Hardline **(3.6 Metacritic user score)**:  gt;The retail version of Battlefield Hardline debuted at No. 1 in the UK software sales chart in its first launch week. It also became the best-selling title in the UK in 2015 as of March 23, 2015. According to NPD Group, the game was the best-selling game in March in the United States. So that's a no then. Also, even though some people really, *really* want Denuvo to be the next SecuROM that kills hardware, tanks FPS and makes your life miserable, it didn't have any significant problems for legitimate users yet.</TEXT>

    <TITLE>Why don't most people (willingly) become ghoulified?</TITLE>
    <DATE>2015-07-25 05:39:37</DATE>
    <TEXT>Ghoulification seems like a relatively trivial way to achieve immortality (or at least a dramatically increased lifespan) - that alone should probably make it coveted, if only as a desperate Pascal's Wager decision ("if I bathe in this pile of radioactive barrels it might turn me into a ghoul or kill me via rad poisoning - but chances are I'll soon die of old age anyway"). And, hell, in 200 years chances are someone would have found the ghoulification-as-opposed-to-death catalyst factor. So what gives?</TEXT>

    <TEXT>This is probably the most comprehensive answer so far. Thanks! Two things I slightly disagree with though: 1 - as another comment helpfully reminded, Desmond of Point Lookout figured out how to become a ghoul before or shortly after the Great War (unsurprisingly via controlled rad exposure) and promptly did so - therefore he can probably replicate the process - unless the player is an idiot and sides with Calvert. *But, being the jerk he is, he probably won't ever share it with any faction much less Generic Shantytown #328.* 2/3 and 6 - are mutually exclusive. If there's a mass increase in ghoulification, at some point bigotry against ghouls would become inappropriate - everyone does it so you're hating on Future You and the elderly. Some societies might still have a Little Lamplight thing where people are banished (or worse) for ghoulification, but YMMV - obviously this is much more likely to occur in the Enclave than in the NCR. EDIT: sucks to be the early "adopters" though.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>On the contrary, some SKs like putting cryptic references to OTHER people's names in their deathnotes, *game of deception* and all. If there's a name referencing something everyone in the game will probably get (politics/memes/Star Wars/Undertale?), I usually frame the person with that name by putting really obnoxious references to it in deathnotes. It works about 10-15% of the time. Also: if for some reason you're scum and didn't kill on a night, just add *"%RandomPerson% is immune!"* to your note - now THAT's a foolproof strategy! From my experience town just can't comprehend the possibility that the person being "called out" is not scum/survivor/BG/jailed and doesn't need to have any "excuses" for being immune, they might just be implicated straight out of nowhere. Seriously, "X is immune!" in scum wills may as well mean "please focus on taking X out XOXO~" and should ALWAYS be taken with a grain of salt.</TEXT>

It has the same fundamental idea as JSawyer (*"make New Vegas harder like"*) but comes with vastly overhauled locations, survival-y features and resource scarcity, all-new enemies and a storyline uncovered as the game progresses - the series would be a must-watch just because of the mod's sheer novelty. This playthrough is just New Vegas with a bunch of numbers adjusted (bullet sponges yaaaaaaay!), marginally better texturework and Snipey the Sniperman once again shooting things from stealth to get criticals. I'm just having a hard time watching this over *literally anything else on the channel* - which is a bit sad because the series will probably have some great commentary and fun moments along the way.</TEXT>

In retrospect that was probably an unrelated ranged mob.  gt;and you were at the vault for over an hour  gt;What concerns me is the amount of time you spent at that vault taking screenshots ...well, that's awkward. What _actually_ happened is I - stayed in the bottom for approximately 20 seconds before being killed by a skeleton. - ran from my spawn at the MTA to the vault to _attempt to_ retrieve my stuff (here's hoping that nobody else went through that chunk for 15 minutes or something) - didn't take the correct stairs, died from fall damage. - ran to the vault _again_. - took the correct stairs this time, went in circles for five minutes trying to find my crap, but it has since despawned. D'oh. Cue the incident. I'm not sure how the entire thing registered on a snitche's GUI, but there you have it.</TEXT>

Because if so, that particular branch _has_ to have juicier lore than the default :P Anyhow: purchased the story, ~~looking forward to playing it once FBG fixes an [issue](http://i.imgur.com/4NVFHV8.png) with the hub area~~ and started my journey to the North.

Even if you've never been to the area, starting from scratch and progressing until Wednesday is still better than grinding Echoes for cats. - POSI spouses are much cheaper than cats. Betray 'em all! - "Cold-betraying" random active players has a decent chance of working, too. Just make sure to generously thank the folks you end up corrupting.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>The concept of self-aware AI wasn't taken too seriously ("why does my janitorial unit request a living wage and political representation that's not how vacuum cleaners work please refund this") until they built some [lovely abstract art](http://i.imgur.com/aWJ7bkO.jpg) next to the Cirrulan homeworld, showcasing their newfound culture. Alas, a fleet had to be called in to clean up the installation due to landowner (spaceowner?) complaints, but it was so touching that the entire synth population was subsequently given full citizenship. But seriously: if the numbers in [the wiki](http://www.stellariswiki.com/Crisis) are still relevant, you should be able to **force** the AI rebellion relatively easily with a very specific build (Fanatic Materialist + Mechanist, play tall, rush Synthetics, spam slave synths and ignore opt-out events). The Scourge OTOH is a mess.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>The Varelviv abominations, the Rixi heathens and the Uthonian blasphemers - a fine selection of filth indeed. Their coalition has attempted to attack our Uthabulan allies and they've paid the price for their insolence - Varelviv fleets were [crushed](http://i.imgur.com/V8DIlV6.jpg), their planets [captured](http://i.imgur.com/BmE0Cjp.png) and their citizens withering without the guidance of their wretched "network". Their ["enlightened" allies](http://i.imgur.com/jdytjcY.png) will soon be subjugated by the Uthabulans. And, in the middle of this turmoil, it was done.

    <TEXT> gt;I'm not entirely sure I get your point with regards to Ancient Basin, but the transition is pretty obvious as you even stated. The seals for the Sealed Vessel are being broken, and as a result the infection has begun spreading rapidly in the surrounding area of the Black Egg, which happens to be Forgotten Crossroads. Right, that's what happens when you trigger the zone via a Dreamer death - but the _other_ trigger (defeating Broken Vessel) [doesn't really make any sense](http://i.imgur.com/gO3DZ4d.jpg). I guess it could be explained as the HK feeling that particular vessel's death using his... vessel-y sense? 'eh.  gt;Also your point with regards to bugs dealing 2 damage makes light of the fact that they're extremely easy to avoid. The bug that charges at you will literally only sprint on one direction and kamikaze on whatever wall it hits. You either jump over it or shadow dash through it and that's the end of it. Bugs exploding for 2 damage after 3 seconds of giving you time to run away is being more than just a bit generous. Their difficulty level in a vacuum is perfectly fine. It's just that at this point in the game the zone is already "cleared out" - there are no new bosses or plot items to be found. The only reason to ever go there is to get from Point A (a stag station, the well) to Point B (grubdad, charm vendor, Brooding Mawlek, Failed Champion), and the infected bugs happen to feel like they're specifically designed to be a nuisance: can't casually sprint through most areas because the husk variant charges for 2 damage with almost no tell, can't casually jump-dash because the vengefly variant has a huge hitbox now and WILL charge you in the face, have to wait for 5 seconds after clearing out an enemy because so many of them have exploding corpses.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>This is actually a solid idea - the infection never "travelled" anywhere, the timeline just happened to progress at that exact point. A cutscene at that point (just a 3-second replay of the intro where the HK rattles in the egg) to show that _something_ just happened somewhere in the world would have been nice, but I guess it might have ruined the surprise.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Xenophobe sounds like End of the Cycle except you never get an option to opt out. It's a fun concept but I think playing as the designated feeding grounds for a FE should really be an optional choice and not something rolled at the start of the game. Xenophile and Spiritualist are neat - better than the current ones. Pacifist is _really_ neat. If every empire does a defensive pact you might set up a nice "you vs. the entire galaxy" war in the mid-late game.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Weedbro is quickly becoming one of my favorite characters. He's just so positive and generous. Practically costs nothing at all in one minute you copypaste him into MS Paint and that chill ass motherfucker gives you a punchline to use later in the comic. And you also get this adorable little footer can comment on things but usually is too harmless to be removed. But more than the bro is just so positive. It starts out like "Troll like boss!" and I'm like "yeah WB I wanna troll like a boss let's do this shit" and then he's like "THIS IS RELATABLE" and I'm like "yeah it's SO RELATABLE." He doesn't say some bullshit macho shit like "TEACHER RESIGNED  #128514; #128514;" he's just like "nah shit's relatable." And he looks so happy. I mean this is a fictional character literally brought to life by mediocre memes. It understands it's life is a temporary artistic gift and the dude is just fucking loving it. [I mean look at his face he's just so happy.](https://vignette4.wikia.nocookie.net/be-like-bro/images/e/e3/Weedbro.png/revision/latest?cb=20170424214950) I am literally never sad when weedbro is in the comic.

    <TEXT> gt;Have you ever played a PvP game? CSGO? COD? Battlefield? does the game tells you where the enemy is at all times? The enemy is in the opposite half of a walled-off 500x500m map, probably rushing to the center to accomplish some sort of objective or holding a strategic chokepoint. Now how exactly do you think this will work in an open-world game?</TEXT>
