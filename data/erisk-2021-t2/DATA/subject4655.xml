    <TEXT>Yeeeeahhh, nope, i do not believe you. Look at the first comment bro. One of the armenians said too how it is not uncommon to depict turks as enemies. Now you are telling me totally different thing. Come on, maaaan....Look, i do not say what this pre-school did is right, nope it is totally wrong, i could say it is not a common thing for pre-schools and elementary schools. Still, what these people does, it sucks. But, what i really hate is f.cking hipocrasy, not just on your side, on my side too. It is not like we are devils and you guys are pure fucking angels or vice verse. And again i acknowledge what they did in this video sucks bad, and i also say that it is not a usually common thing for pre and elementary school, still it is bad. But you also have to stop pretending like your history teachers in school never says to you guys how turks are rapers, animals and etc. I mean, the whole shitshow in Karabagh started because of this hate towards turks and some of the people use this hate towards turks on us for political purposes and fuel everything up. You can not deny it, i mean not in my face. My fathers side got deported from armenia, i have talked about this with my grandma, she said everyhing was fine btw azeris and armenians in beginning of 80s. It started changing after 85, she told me after 85, people started calling them turks, not azeris. You see, again i say, the whole thing started because of hate and some of the people use this hate on us for political purposes. Have a nice day.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>She have never said that caucasian albanian were turks, listen carefully. They are caucasians, what she is trying to say is that we are direct descendants of mainly caucasian albanians and iranic people who become turk (3rd etnic) by mixing, marrying with turkic nomads. Our history in here, we are natives, we have always been natives to these lands, we did not come here in 11th century, We become turks by mixing with turks and adopting turkic culture and language. But our history have always been here, not in central asia and mongolia</TEXT>

You are probably got banned from this page by our moderator who is in fact south azerbaijani who considers himself turk and you got pissed off and opened fake, troll profile.

    <DATE>2020-06-29 13:15:14</DATE>
    <TEXT>Azerbaijan is grappling to come to terms with a fresh Internet news scandal. This one doesn #8217;t concern pesky domestic bloggers who tweak government sensitivities. And it is not about media rights. #160; Rather, it covers a topic generally given a wide berth in Baku, even by Azerbaijan #8217;s political opposition -- First Lady Mehriban Aliyeva. Aliyeva over the past few weeks has become the subject of unprecedented coverage in foreign newspapers. First, the right-wing Italian daily Il Foglio published an article December 3, using unnamed diplomats as sources, alleging  #8220;informal meetings #8221; of a possibly romantic nature occurred in Berlin between Aliyeva and Belorussian President Alexander Lukashenko. #160; Then, on December 12, a British daily, The Guardian, published a story about a WikiLeaks cable, reportedly prepared by a US Embassy staffer in Baku, describing the political influence and business interests of Aliyeva #8217;s family, and speculating about the First Lady #8217;s possible use of plastic surgery. As a member of parliament, deputy chairperson of the governing Yeni Azerbaijan Party, a goodwill ambassador for UNESCO and the Organization of Islamic States, and head of the charitable Heydar Aliyev foundation  #8211; no other woman in Azerbaijan has such a prominent -- and uniformly positive -- public image. To suggest otherwise is to risk incurring the wrath of President Aliyev, who is known among Azerbaijani journalists for having greater tolerance for public criticism of himself than of his family. A 2010 story by The Washington Post about multi-million-dollar property in Dubai allegedly owned by the president #8217;s 13-year-old son, Heydar, has been cited as contributing to a flare-up of tension in Azerbaijani-US relations. While Il Foglio has caused a stir for touching on what is seen as President Aliyev #8217;s personal honor, the WikiLeaks information, provided via The Guardian, has not. The alleged 2010 US embassy cable, which has been republished in some Azerbaijani media outlets, names the First Lady #8217;s family, the Pashayevs, as  #8220;the single most powerful family in Azerbaijan, #8221; with holdings in construction/real estate and the financial and telecommunications sectors. The family, it claims, uses  #8220;government mechanisms #8221; to keep out business competitors, while maintaining de facto control of certain ministries -- including Culture and Tourism, Youth and Sport, Health, and Education -- that are seen as under the First Lady #8217;s domain. The Azerbaijani government has earlier dismissed the WikiLeaks releases as untruthful, and is expected to raise the matter privately with US officials. As with the Il Foglio article, any allegation made against the First Lady herself is not considered a matter appropriate for public debate in Baku.

    <TEXT>Second and the fourth one is a dreamer map, nothing more. A third did happened tho in 1918 if i am not mistaking but it only took one or two month if i remembering correctly. And in first one i did not see anyhing wrong. It is a transcaucasian map showing ethnicities and where they live. There are few mistakes like armenians being majority in tbilisi at that times, which they were, if i remember correctly. "they themselves admitted that the ethnic descriptions were based entirely around racial stereotypes. Using racial stereotypes is by definition racist." -- gt; where do you live bro? Europe, america? Because in here, caucasia if you say something like that people would look at you like a weird person. But i understand you though, but still it is just not working in these region. Different mindsets i guess.

The main problem in europe, america could be racism, but in this region, main thing in here, people in this region is to make their and their family's life easier, you get what i am sayin??

    <TEXT>You are actually right, i think. here take a look: Acem, the word used by the Arabs for foreigners other than themselves, was used by the Ottomans to characterize Persians. For this reason, it is also mentioned in Turkish as a word used in the sense of Iran. It was used for people from Iran during the Ottoman era. Therefore, Iranians are generally known as Acem One of the important and problematic geographic terms that research on the Ottoman, Iran and Central Asia is Acem or Acemistan. The term "Acem" in Arabic means a foreigner in comparison to the Arab, and non-Arabic. The word "Acem" was used by the Arabs in particular for Iranians during pre-Islamic conquests. Iranians used this term for Iran and beyond. The Ottomans followed the Arab tradition and used the term Acem to describe Iran and beyond. However, it is not possible to include Turkistan in the Persian / Iranian geographical area through the term Acem. As the historical reality, it is known that Turkistan is separate from the Iranian geography, and the term "Acem" used by both Arabs and Ottomans means Iran and beyond. In the XV.-XVII. centuries, the geographical place referred to as Acemistan, Bil #226;d- #305; Acem or Vil #226;yet-i Acem includes not only Iran today but also Khorasan and all Turkistan. \[4\] In the sources, there are records such as "It is Acem" and "It came from Acem" for many scholars coming to the Ottoman country. Again, for the scholarship of many students from the Ottoman country, he went to Acem with the expressions such as "He went to Diyar- #305; Acem", "Arrived in Bil #226;d- #305; Acem", "Seen to be educated in Acem" . It is not clear whether they went to Iran or Turkistan. \[5\] [https://tr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acem\_(topluluk)](https://tr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acem_(topluluk))  #8203; The word Acem was used for Iranians during the first Islamic conquests. In this period, the word of Acem, which the conqueror Arabs gave to their humiliating meaning expressing their social and political superiority, Since the (IX.) Century, it has only meant an ethnic and geographical distinction, with non-Arab societies and especially Iranians gaining power in the Islamic world, as well as in the social and cultural sphere. Within this framework, the term Ir #226;k- #305; Acem #238; was started to be used for the central Iran (al-Jib #226;l), which was between Isfahan, Hemedan and Tehran since the Seljuk period, and Ir #226;k- #305; Arab #238; for the Mesopotamia region known as Iraq. In the following periods, as the word "Acem" was used for the whole of Iran, it was also used in the Persian and Turkish meanings of "Iranian" and "Iranians" (see Dihhud #226;, Lu #289;atn #226;me, "acm" art.). The reason for calling Azeri Turks "Acem" in Turkey is because of their relations with Iran as well. In addition, the word "Acem" in Turkish and Persian is used metaphorically for the meaning of "an inexperienced person."

    <TITLE>Shah Ismail 1 and his Love towards his Mother Tongue (Turkish), decline of Persian literature</TITLE>
    <DATE>2020-07-05 13:22:23</DATE>
    <TEXT> #8203; *** #8220;Persian books were treated like wastepaper. #8221;*** In the very beginning of the Safavid government in Iran, with the centrality of West Azerbaijan and because of the love and care of Shah Ismail and his QizilBashes #8223; role in the formation of the Safavid empire, the Turkish language and its related literature, because of the strength behind it, gained great prestige and influence among the people. Apart from these facts, the acute influence of Turkish language on Iranian society reached such a level that many Persian books were translated into Turkish and many terms were used as basic words in Persian language which are still in use throughout Iran. ***In this period, the*** ***Safavid officials had to speak and write orders in Turkish*** ***as an official language.*** ***For example, during the reign of Shah Ismail, Shah Tahmasb and Shah Abbas, according to De Lavale, Olarius, Sanson and Kempfer, they even had to learn Turkish in order to communicate with the king and his officials of Safavids.*** It is said that the Qizil-Bashes in the army were Turkish speakers from the Ottoman Empire, therefore many Turkish words and related literature passed through into the Persian language and the regions that they occupied. The Safavid kings established a foundation for the development of Turkish literature because of the fact that many Qizil-Bashes could not speak or understand Persian language and spoke in their own mother tongue within the Safavid Empire, therefore Persian literature surrendered itself to Turkish literature and language. ***As Qutb-al-DinMohammad Fuduli says,  #8220;Persian books were treated like wastepaper. #8221;*** The Safavid kings in Iran, from the beginning till the end of their rules, because of their mother-tongue and the majority of their army-men (The Qizil -Bashes) were Turks and Turkmens and the back-bone of the king #8223;s power and army, showed a great respect and concerns towards the Turkish language and Its related literature. Along with the progress of Turkification of the Safavid court and army in the beginning, the Turkish language, because of the strength behind it gained prestige and influence over the Persian language. Besides, ***at the same period the acute influence of Turkish language on Persian society reached such a level that countless Persian literary men left the country and for the better life went to India and the Ottoman Empire.*** For this reasons and so on the contemporary historians believe that the Persian language and literature had its high decline and  #8220;at any rate no doubt that during the Safavid period literature and poetry in Persia had sunk to a very low ebb and that not one single poet; of the first rank on be rekond as representing this epoch. #8221; ***Intellectual Life of Sh #257;h Ism #257; #8216; #299;l I*** The use of the Turkish language at the court of Sh #257;h Ism #257; #8222; #299;l was widespread because during the time that they were in power they spread the Tukish culture even more than the Aq-Quyunlu and their rivals Qara-Quyunlus. One of the main reasons for this progress was the high number and large tribes of the Turks and Turkmens in the Safavid army. This is not surprising since it was the language spoken by Sh #257;h Ism #257; #299;l himself. Although he had learned Persian too, he more commonly spoke Turkish, the language of most of his followers. No doubt, this preference for Turkish and the patronage of his Turkish-speaking subjects was an important factor in the death of Persian literary works written in the early Safav #299;d period. Aside from these facts, in this period the acute influence of Turkish language on Iranian society reached such a level that many Turkish terms were used as basic words in Persian language and still are in use in Persian society. Along with the progress of Turkification in the Safavid court and army, the Turkish language, because of the strength behind it, gained special prestige and influence among the people. But this is not the whole picture. Sh #257;h Ism #257; #8222; #299;l himself apparently composed a few poems in Persian, as did his courtiers. Generally speaking, the Turkish language was destined to remain in vogue in the court until the end of the Safav #299;d period  #256;r #257;sl #299; asserts that *Sh #257;h Ism #257; #299;l believed:* *** #171;The people who do not know their mother-tongue and their national literature wouldnot be able to realize the importance of their country and their nationality. #187;*** While one cannot totally repudiate the claims that have been made about Sh #257;h Ism #257; #8222; #299;l #8223;s abilities as a poet, one cannot absolutely accept that all these attributions are accurate. But, supporting the majority of critics, we accept the idea of his having had some poetical ability. Many critics believe that Sh #257;h Ism #257; #8222; #299;l composed about 10,000 couplets in the anthologies called Mathnav #299;- ye- Dahn #257;ma; Nas #299;hat-n #257;ma, Man #257;qib al-Asr #257;r-Wa  #8211;Bihjat- al- Ahr #257;r and D #299;w #257;n-i  #8223;Ash #257;re-e- Rub #257; #299; ***in Turkish.*** What stands out in the works attributed to Sh #257;h Ism #257; #8222; #299;l is their fluency and clarity. The reason is obvious:  #171;He was not writing for his own heart #8223;s delight. He had to address his adherents in a language fully intelligible to them, a language which stemmed from their daily life #8221; .The Safavid kings created a kind of foundation for the development of Turkish literature because of the fact that some Qizil-Bashes could not understand Persian and spoke mainly in their own mother tongue, Turkish, within the Safavid empire. As a result, Persian literature surrendered itself to Turkish literature and language. For example, note the following statement given by Mohammad Aref Motarjem Ispenaqchi: *** #8220;During the month of Muharram, particularly on the day of  #8222; #256;sh #363;r #257; (the tenth of Muharram), Sh #257;h Ism #257; #8222; #299;l used to perform ceremonies personally to show his respect for the martyrs. As already mentioned, the King used to send a Qur #8223; #257;n reader or a Ta #8222;z #299;yeh Khw #257;n to the public pulpit in the J #257;me #8222;a mosque on this particular day to carry out the ritual of the mourning day by reading the Rawdat al-Shuhad #257;,18 and the general populace used to weep and mourn on that day. Since this book was written in Persian and most of the am #299;rs and Q #299;z #299;-B #257;sh were uninstructed in Persian, they could not understand the mourning ceremony. Therefore, Mull #257; Muhammad Baghd #257;d #299;, who had the pen-name "Fud #363;l #299;", and who was one of the great men of learning among the Turks, was ordered by Sh #257;h Ism #257; #8222; #299;l to translate the book of Maqtal (Martyrs) into Turkish, which he did very well and which he entitled Hadiqat al-Su #8222;ad #257;.*** The author of Inqil #257;b-e-Isl #257;m himself on behalf of Fuduli has left us this account of the project: *** #171;Since the mourning book had been prepared in Persian, the great Turks could not appreciate the mourning ceremonies, especially the part of those which dealt with the martyrs of Karbal #257; #8222;. Books written in Persian were treated like wastepaper and were not used in their mourning ceremonies. Therefore, I (Fud #363;l #299;) was ordered to write a book on martyrdom. At that time the celebrated and well read books on martyrdom were the Maqtal-i Ab #363; Han #299;fa and Misra #8222;-i T #363;s #299;, which Sayyid Rid #257; al-D #299;n Abu #8222;l-Q #257;sim #8222;Al #299; b. M #363;s #257; b. Ja #8222;far b. Muhammad al-T #363;s #299; had collected with great care and caution and which he had edited, using many important and reliable sources. The one which is now common is Kit #257;b-i Rawdat al-Shuhad #257;, written by the great preacher and scholar, Maul #257;n #257; Husain W #257; #8222;iz K #257;shif #299;, also composed with great care. I, the abject servant (bandeh-yi Kh #257;ks #257;r) followed his example, drawing on his work and other materials available to me, and titling my book Had #299;qat al-Su #8222;ad #257;. #187;*** It has been mentioned that the content of Sh #257;h Ism #257; #8222; #299;l #8223;s poetical works was at first humanity, then religion and politics.  #256;r #257;sl #299; says that in order to express his political aims to his followers, Sh #257;h Ism #257; #8222; #299;l transformed them into verses. ***The Azerbaijani folk-singers called  #8222; #256;shiqs, who were always in his camp, used to sing in their celebrations and in the battle poems of their murshid.*** Here is a selection of his political and didactic poems:  #171;If you want greatness, make the first move, step by step, as on a ladder, The son of Sult #257;n Haydar has conquered the world, and his men have become rich by this conquest. #187; It is said that ***Sh #257;h Ism #257; #8222; #299;l has loved the classic writings of Azerbaijan, and especially the literary style of  #8222;Am #257;d al-D #299;n Nas #299;m #299;, the poet of the Hur #363;f #299; sect.*** According to  #256;r #257;sl #299;, Sh #257;h Ism #257; #8222; #299;l modeled himself on Nas #299;m #299; not only in his literary style, but also in his ideology.  #8203; ***Conclusion:*** The conclusions that could be drawn from this discussion are as follows: 1-The presence of Qizil-Bashes in the Safavid army, in spite of Shah Ismail #8223;s having grown up in Gilan #8223;s providences, and his mother tongue made it possible to devote himself to the advancement of Turkish language and its literature. 2-The migrations of the Ottoman subjects and Iranian Turks and Persians to each others #8223; countries was the second factor for these relationships and developments. 3-Choosing Tabriz city as the Capital of the Safavid dynasty was the third cause for this relationship and the development of Turkish language and its literature. 4-One of the big reasons for this progress and relations was the high number and large tribes of the Ottoman Turks and Turkmens in the Safavid court and army and their coming and going into these countries. 5-The golden age of Turkish language and its literature in Iran was in the Safavid periods.  #8203; ***Authors of this article:*** \-- gt; Mohammad Karim Yousefjamali (Iran) \-- gt; Azar Gholizadeh Sarabi (Iran)  #8203; ***Source:*** \-- gt; you can read full article in the link below [http://jhss-khazar.org/wp-content/uploads/2012/06/03zakir-mlmSON-YENI-VARIANT-IRAN.pdf](http://jhss-khazar.org/wp-content/uploads/2012/06/03zakir-mlmSON-YENI-VARIANT-IRAN.pdf)  #8203;</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Later della Valle provides more information about the spread of Turkish, which he ascribes to the fact that the army mostly consists of Turkic speaking Qizilbash tribesmen, who did not know Persian, and because the shah spent most of his time with them he had to know Turkish, and  #8220;as a result Turkish is very widespread in use at court, and this includes the women at court and the officeholders. #8221; Source: Pietro Della Valle, Les Fameux Voyages</TEXT>

Since you are iranian, i am pretty sure that it will be easier for you to contact with these guys, considering that they are both iranians who have studied in Iran. Now, back to your question, yes i have heard about Shahnameh, but i am not willing to discuss it specially with you. The reason i do not want to discuss it with you and people like you, it is because i do not have any kind of respect towards pan-iranist nationalists and not just pan-iranians, to every nationalists with a "pan" on it. So, again i say, if you find this article absurd, and if you have concerns about this article, you can contact with authors who are also iranians who have studied in Iran and you can take your concerns, questions and complaints to them.

    <TITLE>Sah Ismail and Kurds, Kurdish people</TITLE>
    <DATE>2020-07-07 20:27:04</DATE>
    <TEXT> #8203; ***Safavids policies and practices to purify Kurdistan from the Kurds and bring Azeri Turks and Turkmens to their place:*** "***If the Kurds did not call, Yavuz Sultan Selim would never dare to attack Shah Ismail."*** It is important to examine the situation of the Kurds trapped between the Ottoman Empire and the Safavids Empire. Murad Ciwan #8217;s "Ottomans, Safavids and Kurds in the Battle of  #199;ald #305;ran" is an important source in this respect. The subtitle of this review is ***"The First Ottoman-Kurdish Alliance (1514)".*** An important aspect of this study is that in Ottoman historiography, the established views about the Battle of  #199;ald #305;ran are being questioned. The assessment of the Venetian traveler, Giovanni Maria Angiolelloa, have to be taken into consideration. The Venetian traveler says: "***If the Kurds did not call, the great turk Yavuz Sultan Selim would never dare to attack Shah Ismail."*** This statement required the examination of Shah  #304;smail, Yavuz Sultan Selim, K #252;rdler / Kurdistan relations at that time. Shah Ismail, in 1501, destroyed the Akkoyunlu State, took over Tabriz, the Safavids rule was established in Iran, the Twelve Imam Shia Sects were declared the official sect. Shah Ismail seized the lands of Sunni Uzbeks in the East, and dominated a wide area from the Caucasus Mountains in the North to the Persian Gulf in the South. Safavid's border with the Mamluks was the Euphrates River from South to North. Bilecik, Urfa, Harput, Erzincan,  #199;emi #351;gezek (wide Dersim Region) came under Safavid rule. Safavids became neighbors with the Ottoman State in the west of Sivas, Amasya and Tokat. All this shows that most of Kurdistan is under the control of Safavids. ***Safavid administration and Shah Ismail do not treat the Kurds at all. For example;Shah Ismail invited the Kurdish tribal chiefs to the palace,*** ***arrested them and put them in jail. He used to exile some tribal chiefs to different corners of Iran.*** Naw #351;irwan Mustafa Emin explains the purpose of Shah Ismail in 3 points in his book "Kurd  #251; Ecem": 1. To take the Myrs in the hands of the Kurdish Myrs, to move them away from their regions and ***to*** ***replace them with the K #305;z #305;lba #351; Turks,*** 2. Forcing Sunni Kurds to change sects, 3. To exert violence against the leaders, the people and the Kurds who protected their power at that time during the Akkoyunlu state #8230; Naw #351;irwan Mustafa gives 3 Kurdish Myrs as examples:  #199;emi #351;gezek Spell Hac #305; R #252;stem Bey, Shah R #252;stemi Lor and Zahir Bey Hakkari etc #8230; Meanwhile, as it is known, Shah Ismail drove his military forces under the command of Nuri Ali Khalifa Rumlu, against Erzincan and especially  #199;emi #351;gezek people, and put Han Muhammedhan Ustaclu against Diyarbekir Kurds. ***After Nuri Ali Khalifa Rumlu invaded the region, he carried out*** ***massacres against the Kurds in the region*** and sent the leaders of  #199;emi #351;gezek to Ecem Iraq, including M #238;r Hac #238; R #251;stem. Of course, M #238;r Hac #238; R #251;stem and his accompanying people go to Xoy and inform Shah Ismail about their loyalty in order to return to their former power. However, ***Shah Ismail places M #238;r Hac #238; R #251;stem in another area, not to return to Kurdistan, depending on his existing policy against the Kurdish Myrs.*** Prior to the Battle of  #199;ald #305;ran, ***Shah Ismail was liquidating the Kurdistan Myrs and deploying Turkmen (not Alevi Kurds) instead. For example, Turkmen officials assign the head of Kurdish cities such as Mara #351;, Hasankef, Diyarbekir, Erzincan, Kemah, Ki #287;i, Erzincan etc. These assignments do not take place peacefully, but as a result of war and massacres.*** Bey of Hesenk #234;f fortress M #238;r M #238;r Xelil Eyyubi, one of the lords of Kurdistan, before the  #199;ald #305;ran War, want to go to the city of Xoy with great gifts and report their loyalty to Shah Ismail. As it is known, although the dignity of Kurdish Eyyubi lost throughout the Middle East, Hesenk #234;f continued as the last fortress of the Ayyubids. M #238;r Xel #238;l Eyyub #238; was the brother-in-law of Shah Ismail (he was married to his sister). ***Except one or two of the myrs, all of them who went to report their loyalty to Shah Ismail were arrested and replaced by Q #305;z #305;lbash Turks.*** M #238;r Xelil is in prison in Tabriz for 3 years and then runs away. A number of Kurdish circles are able to carry out hollow and unrealistic analyzes by ignoring the Safavids' massacres in Kurdistan, ***Safavids policies and practices to purify Kurdistan from the Kurds and bring Azeri Turks and Turkmens to their place.*** In the face of this attitude of Shah Ismail and Safavids, seeking help from the Ottoman Empire was born as a serious thought among the Kurdish tribes. This is how the Kurdish tribes introduced the Idris-i Bitlisi and did invite the Ottomans to the war against Shah Ismail.  #304;dris-i Bitlisi was a bureaucrat that served Uzun Hasan and Saraya during the Akkoyunlular period. The father of  #304;dris-i Bitlisi also served Akkoyunlu people. Reports were frequently sent to the Ottoman Palace about Shah Ismail's banning Sunni in Kurdistan, inviting the Kurds to Shiite. The number of these reports were increasing. The content of the reports was also getting heavier. Shah Ismail's anti-Ottoman and pro-Shiite policies in the Ottoman country were the main topics that were mentioned in these reports. ***Safavids ended the power of the overwhelming majority of the Kurdish Mirians in Kurdistan for decades before Yavuz Sultan Selim took power in 1512 and the Kurds of  #206;dr #238;s #238; Bedl #238;s took the alliance with the Ottomans.*** Yavuz Sultan Selim sat on the throne in 1512.  #304;n 23 May 1512. Yavuz, as soon as he sits on the throne, is considering a trip to Hungary. The notables of the palace, viziers, commanders are also in favor of expedition to Hungary. However, ***the frequent application of the Kurds to the palace, the invitation of Yavuz Sultan Selim to Shah  #304;smail, leaves Yavuz in a privileged position. After all, the Kurds convince Yavuz. Although the commanders and viziers are eyebrows, a war decision is taken against Shah Ismail and Safavids.***  #8203; ***Source***: 1.

    <TEXT>Yeah, welcome to the sad, delusional Pan-Iranist, Persian Mindset. In their eyes, this guy is a proud kurdish nationalist, and Safavid dynasty is a Kurdish dynasty. He may happen to massacre and kill kurds, put them on dangeon, torture them, make them leave their home, replace them with turks (***not even alevi kurds***), but hey, he still is a proud kurd, since he happens to have a kurdish ancestor (which is still a theory) even though he has also a greek, georgian and turkic (god forbid) ancestors. But we just gonna neglect all three (***especially the turkic one***) and focus only the kurdish one (***since it is iranic***), even though he made the azeri turkish as a court language and official language, army consisting of turks, make the turks to hold up all most important positions in empire, write poems mostly in azeri turkish which is his mother language. ***Yeah, such a Proud Kurd he is.*** P. S. And the most "bruh" moment is that, there are even some kurds who consider  #350;ah Ismail as a proud kurdish man and the Safavids as a kurdish dynasty which is just too funny, too sad and too fucked up at the same time.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Mainly 2 reasons. 1st one is something have to do with russia, they say russia have a plan to bring his "peacekeeper" army in Azerbaijan. Or there is a second reason, which is have to do armenia's internal affairs which also have something to do with russia. According to them, in armenia, there is a some kind of secret political conflict between pasinyan and opposition. They say, as much as, armenia is ally of russia, but pasinyan is not very fond of russia, but the opposition is a very russophone. And it something that has links with the opposition side. Apparently, opposition kind of wanted to prove that azerbaijan attacks them even in tovhuz (which is not karabagh), so that they can show that armenia needed russia very much. In a discussion, they say if azerbaijan wanted to do it because of internal affairs, they would do it in karabagh, not on tovhuz. These are the ones mainly discussed in a discussion with political adviser, who is also vey famous for bashing aliyev dynasty. P.s. sorry for bad english</TEXT>

I am pretty sure that Russian nationalists are also thinking the same way. Can't say the same thing about turkey tho, and i am telling you as a person who lives almost 7 years in turkey. Main goal of turkish ultra-nationalists are to "unite" all turkic speaking countries under one country which is fucked up just for us.

    <TEXT>Why in the fuck do you expect us azeris to respect iran while azeris in iran does not have their basic linguistical rights??? Hell man, even i would expect that considering your supressive, backward, idiotic, asshole mollah regime, but the thing is most of persians that i have met in quora and reddit while considering themselves being liberal (ironic) do not support the idea to give azeris in iran their basic rights which is something that we can never accept. ***NEVER***. And i also met a lot of azeris from iran while one of them being my best friend and guess fucking what, none of them like how they are being treated in Iran. And also the other thing is, while, again, considering themselves liberal, many persians that i have seen are very fond of that faschist pahlavi regime. The regime that costed my family from mother side to leave their homes, their lands. My family were  #351;ahsevens man, a fucking  #351;ahseven. The loyal soldiers of  #350;ah. And because of that faschist regime, they have to leave their home. And after that, what i see? I see a lot of persians almost worship to pahlavis, then you guys come up and asking me to respect you? Gtfoh P. S. for your information, the person that ask the question, is not Azeri but Georgian, and even georgians can see your wet dreams. But while him being georgian, you suddenly think that it was azeris who open up the topic even though he deliberately says "you guys" to us. JUst shows the obsession of you pan-iranian persians over us, azeris. And FYI, the qajars, efsars, safavids and their armies were also azeris (turks). Even though, they are considered as Sah of Iran, the ruling dynasty and army were us. Yes, we azeris ruled Iran. And now, half of azeris got seperated and become independent, and since ruling dynasty and army were one of us, it is also our history and our  #350;ah just as much as it is yours. This is the situation now, deal with it.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>***The people of Shirvan or Azerbaijanis have shown full support to Iran when the time was right*** \--- gt; we are not just a people of Shirvan man, we are azeris/turks too and we are proud of it. ***"a lot of improvement happend in Iranian Azerbaijan because of Iran."*** \--- gt; why only persians says that, i have met a lot of azeris/turks from Iran, while half of them being my friends and one of them being my best friend and all of them said opposite of what you just said. *"When a new government comes they are not kind towards the loyal people of the previous government, I am sure it had nothing to do with them being Azeris "* \-- gt; ***total fucking bullshit.*** Firstly,  #350;ahsavans were not only soldiers of one dynasty-Safavids dynasty, they were also soldiers of Gacar dynasty and also Afsars if i remember correctly and all of these dynasties are azeri/turk dynasties of Iran, just to remind you. Secondly, not only  #350;hahsavans got deported (not all of them), there were also a lot of avarage normal people (who are not soldiers) have to leave their homeland. There are a lot of people in RoA that have family roots to Azerbaijan of Iran. Why do you think that they left? Because Pahlavis were racist piece of shits, denying it and worshiping them as a fucking god is not helping our cause.  #8203; ***"I hope that both Iranians and Azerbaijanis can live in peace, I doubt any of us want war."*** \--- gt; nobody in Azerbaijan wants a war with Iran, except some teenagers and dumb ultra-nationalists who has a teenage mindset. We have seen the worst sides of the war. But we do not respect Iran (not people, except pan-iranist persians which appearantly there are a lot of them in quora, reddit) and we fucking hate mollah regime because of the simple reason. The only thing that we want is azeris/turks of iran to get their basic linguistical and cultural rights that they deserve. Azeris/turks are the biggest minority in Iran, they deserve to have the same linguistical and cultural rights as persians. Hell man, even under fucking russians, soviet -- gt; azeris/turks have their basic rights like learning their language, making songs, movies in our language. We azeris/turks have contributed a lot to Iran, we are the ones who built iran after arab invasion. At least, azeris/turks deserve their ***proper*** linguistic rights. Denying this, not wanting them to have their rights, making them to forget their mother language means disrespecting poets like Nasimi, Fuzuli,  #350;ahriyar and especially to azeri/turk  #350;ah Ismail of Iran. ***If their basic rights were given, azeri/turk people of RoA will be totally fucking cool with Iran.*** ***That is our only problem we have with Iran***, man. And by the way stop calling Safavids as kurds and Kurdish dynasty. It is fucking ridicilious. Even though they might have some kurdish ancestors, which is still very obscure thing by the way, still, they are already turkicisized, became one of us and calling them kurdish dynasty is not only disrespectful towards azeris/turks, it is also disrespectful towards kurds considering that Safavids were famous for massacreing kurds. I am gonna put a link in here with ***kurdish sources***, read this, then ***show it to kurds and ask them if they consider safavids as a kurdish*** [https://www.reddit.com/r/azerbaijan/comments/hn2dsw/sah\_ismail\_and\_kurds\_kurdish\_people/](https://www.reddit.com/r/azerbaijan/comments/hn2dsw/sah_ismail_and_kurds_kurdish_people/) ***And also read this about fascist Pahlavis*** "Having enjoyed the unconditional support of the British, Reza Khan was able to suppress numerous socialist, nationalist, and ethnic movements all over Iran. As early as 1925, he was able to replace the ruling Qajar dynasty with his own Pahlavi dynasty. Soon after, he centralized power and authority in Tehran, ***he*** ***banned the usage of all non-Persian languages in any written form***, ***and set out to enforce his ultranationalist ideology throughout the country***. Having centralized the government, he introduced Farsi as the only legitimate Iranian language and placed a ban on the languages of other nationalities. The other languages were repressed either as an imperfect dialect of Farsi, such as Kurdish, Luri, or as alien, non-Indo-European languages, such as Turkish and Arabic. The non-Persian communities were thus forced to witness ***the eradication of their native culture, language, history, and heritage on a daily basis*** (Asgharzadeh, 2002; Dei and Asgharzadeh, 2003). Under Reza Khan #8217;s rule, the officially sanctified Iranian history rapidly replaced the existing oral and written histories of various ethnic groups and nationalities. Based on the ***dominant racist ideology***, all peoples living in Iran were to have the common  #8220;Aryan ancestry. #8221; The non-Persian nationalities were written new histories in line with an ***Aryanist racist ideology.*** They were not encouraged to be proud of who they were, because according to the dominant ideology, their heritage and culture were nothing of which to be proud. ***They were required to be assimilated to  #8220;the superior Aryan/Persian race and culture, #8221; and if they did not acknowledge the  #8220;superiority of Aryan/Persian race, #8221; they would then become subjected to humiliation, marginalization, and exclusion .*** ***Source***: -- gt; Asgharzadeh, A. (2007). *Iran and the Challenge of Diversity.* \-- gt; author is ***Kurdish*** ***from Iran*** by the way and this racist ideology still continues in iran as the book mentions it.  #304; mean, remember in a television, in a fucking children program how it shows azeri/turk brushing his teeth with a toilet brush? What the fuck is that?? ***Are you still denying Pahlavis being racist piece of shits?*** "People of Tehran can see an abnormally large human being from the villages of \[South\] Azerbaijan in a cage at Tehran zoo" - A display of Persian racism towards Azerbaijanis back back in Pahlavi era.

    <TEXT>Armenians are literally 24/7 in our page. When they share news in our page it is okay, but when we do it, it is false?? And by the way, you just said "unclear origin". And i am saying you that origin is Azerbaijan official Minister of Defence. Our countries having a skirmish in the border. So, whether you like it or not, this video involves you as much as involves us. Asking admins to delete a video with CLEAR origin is unsensible and idiotic.</TEXT>

If you guys have an OFFICIAL source that proves this video is fake, after that you can demand admins to deleted it, hell i would delete it myself and also you guys can show that official source in this page and in our page too.

    <TEXT>Sargsyan and aliyev are exactly the same. The difference is Azerbaijan has oil. Oil is like a gift and a curse to us at the same time. And also geopolitically we are kind of fucked. We are the only country in the world that shares border with Iran and Russia at the same time and both of them have their eyes on Caucasus, espacially on our land because of oil of course. And iran mullah regime is trying to effect us too with their "shia lovers". Just 2 days ago in a protest in Baku, there are suddenly some guys popped up out of nowhere and start secreaming "allahu ekber". About the effect of russia, you already know i guess, no need to explain. So, we have oil, we share border with iran and russia that's why it puts us kind of shitty position. We want democrasy but we certainly do not want another country like America to bring their "democrasy" to us. Also, the real power in a country is not really in aliyev's hand anymore The power is already shifted towards Pashayev family. Ilham's wife Mehriban Aliyeva is also the Pashayev family member. Just check out these Pashayevs, you will see what i am talking about</TEXT>

Especially when there are heightened tensions Just because some people will process it other way, it does not mean that we should stop share our history even if it is dark. For example, I myself have never seen this photo. This photo, this massacre against azeris is part of our history, both of us, armenians and azeris and we should acknowledge it and stop running away from it. The same applies Shusha massacres against armenians. It is also, as hard as it is, part of our history. One of the armenian guy also posted a photo about shusha massacre in this subreddit, nobody deleted it. Because even it is dark, it is our history and we should own it. And same applies to armenians too. ***Peace can only be achievable, if we start owning up and face the atrocities we have done to each other***</TEXT>

    <TITLE>Question to moderators and AZERBAIJANI users</TITLE>
    <DATE>2020-07-21 16:37:48</DATE>
    <TEXT>***My first question is to moderators.*** There was a user named "AttackTheFilth" in here. He was Azerbaijani user. Is he got banned? And if so, why did he got banned from this subreddit? I mean he may have some controversial thoughts and opinions, but it does not mean that he should get banned from this subreddit because of that. I would understand some armenian bots or some delusional pan-persian nationalists to get banned for their controversial opinions but why our own people? From what i see, his last post is "How to stop turkish influence" which is something that i agree with him but in a different way than him, But that is another issue, i don't wanna get banned too because of my opinion. Anyway, after that post there are no posts, no comments from him in this subreddit. I mean, i see alot of armenian bots getting away with their anti-azerbaijani comments. Speaking of armenians, my other question is to ***Azerbaijani*** ***users*** of this subreddit. I myself don't like to argue with people in social platform, trying not to do it. But anyway, do you guys actually believe "peaceloving" comments of armenians? Have you guys seen comments of armenians filled with hate towards turk and azeris in "armenia" subreddit? I have never seen any "peaceful" (except one or two) armenians telling other armenians of that subreddit to be in peace, not being hateful bla bla bla. ***Of course, i am not mentioning all armenians, just wanna point this out in here.*** And also why do most of the armenians actually think that Azerbaijani people will somehow give up the lands to them when goverment will change and aliyev will fuck off from Azerbaijan. Knowing how stubborn my people are, this is something very interesting to me</TEXT>

    <TEXT> #8203; **"A statement by the Prime Minister of Armenia, Nikol Pashinyan, in which he claims that I spoke about the involvement of Azerbaijanis in the Khojaly genocide is absurd", ex-President of Azerbaijan Ayaz Mutallibov said this in an interview with Trend.** "His words have no real basis. In an interview with a Russian newspaper regarding the events in **Khojaly**, I said that there was an unconditional Armenian trace there. I also noted that Armenia tried to further destabilize the situation in Azerbaijan. The opposition was also interested in undermining the situation in the country. However, regarding that interview, I repeatedly spoke about this: I did not use the phrase that the Azerbaijanis committed the **Khojaly** genocide, this is ridiculous, " Mutallibov said. Ayaz Mutallibov added that the position of the "Argumenty i Fakty" newspaper itself, to which Pashinyan referred to an interview in Munich, is not different from Armenia's position.  #8220;This question was originally formulated in such a way as to  #8220;tie me up  #8221;on this topic. But I didn #8217;t have time to argue on this interview - the situation in the republic was so difficult that it was not simple before. But I repeated several times and directly answered: I never said that the Azerbaijanis did it and the Armenians refer to this interview only in order to vindicate themselves somehow, "Ayaz Mutallibov emphasized.  #8203;  #8203; ***Thomas de Waal*** "I have been personally caught up in the Khojali story. In December 2000, while researching my book on the Karabakh conflict, *Black Garden*, I interviewed Serzh Sarkisian, the man who is now president of Armenia and was then Armenia #8217;s minister of defense. When I asked him about Khojali, he said that  #8220;a lot was exaggerated #8221; but he did not deny that Armenians had killed Azerbaijani civilians. He told me:  #8220;Before Khojalu, the Azerbaijanis thought that they were joking with us, they thought that the Armenians were people who could not raise their hand against the civilian population. We needed to put a stop to all that. And that #8217;s what happened. And we should also take into account that amongst those boys were people who had  #64258;ed from \[the anti-Armenian pogroms in\] Baku and Sumgait. #8221; Over the years, this passage has been quoted many times. Some Armenians have suggested that the interview never happened, while Azerbaijanis have ignored my admonition to treat the book as a whole and not to quote from it selectively. Every year I am also asked to give interviews about Khojali and I refuse. It feels wrong to give an  #8220;analysis #8221; of a massacre and I do not want to give short answers without supporting context that can be used in the propaganda efforts of one side in the conflict or the other. This is why we have transcribed the Russian-language interview with Sarkisian and are now publishing it. This confirms that the then defense minister did indeed say what I quote him to have said, while putting it in the context of a long exposition of his views on the Karabakh question. While researching my book, I did around 120 interviews with people who had experience with the Karabakh conflict. Listening back to Serzh Sarkisian, I hear an extremely determined and passionate voice. It is no surprise to me that he rose to be the president of Armenia."  #8203;  gt;"As the survivors of Khojaly say, Here is what the survivors of khojaly says, ***Listen to the survivors if you have a little bit of a gut*** [https://www.youtube.com/watch?](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3hq08XhoS9M)  #8203; P.S. **you are angry to turks for denying Armenian genocide, making up conspiracy theories but when it comes to khojaly massacre you do exact same thing turks do, denial and making up conspiracy theories.**</TEXT>

    <TEXT>According to [Markar Melkonian](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markar_Melkonian), the brother of the Armenian military leader [Monte Melkonian](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monte_Melkonian), "Khojaly had been a strategic goal, but it had also been an act of revenge." The date of the massacre in Khojaly had a special significance: it was the run-up to the fourth anniversary of the anti-Armenian pogrom in the city of Sumgait where the civilian Armenian population was brutally murdered solely because of their ethnic origin. Melkonian particularly mentions the role of the fighters of two Armenian military detachments called the Arabo and Aramo, who stabbed to death many Azeri civilians, despite strict orders given by Monte Melkonian, that no captives were to be harmed Source: [Markar Melkonian](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markar_Melkonian).

Now, tell me, what is the difference between you and the turks who deny armenian genocide? Edit: ***It is not a genocide, khojaly is massacre, but you do not have any manhood to accept Khojaly.

    <TEXT>Since the article is behind a paywall will paste the text below: Hypocritical attacks on Israel are common, but Sarah Leah Whitson takes them to a new level. As Middle East and North Africa director of Human Rights Watch, she is one of the sharpest critics of the Jewish state #8217;s presence in the West Bank, promoting boycotts and international prosecution for the supposed crimes of occupation and settlement. Yet elsewhere Ms. Whitson strongly supports settlements in occupied territories #8212;suggesting that she and her colleagues don #8217;t take their own legal claims against Israel seriously. The settlements Ms. Whitson supports are in Nagorno-Karabakh, an area that was within the borders of post-Soviet Azerbaijan until 1994, when Armenia occupied the region after a protracted war. Since then, the Armenian leadership in Yerevan has actively encouraged the movement of settlers into the area. Many Armenians regard Karabakh as their historic homeland. But the United Nations, international courts and the U.S. all consider it occupied Azeri territory. Ms. Whitson, who is from an Armenian family, served as master of ceremonies at a 2018 fundraiser for the Armenian National Committee of America, a pro-settler charity that views Karabakh as an  #8220;integral part of the Armenian homeland. #8221; Even as Ms. Whitson led Human Rights Watch #8217;s campaign to boycott Israeli economic activity in the West Bank, she took to #160;Twitter #160;to promote Armenian wines, including from the occupied territories. Asked about the inconsistencies between her positions, Ms. Whitson responded by email:  #8220;My personal support for Armenian diaspora organizations pertains to their charitable and educational work in Armenia and their efforts to advocate for recognition of the Armenian Genocide. #8221; This explanation is at odds with HRW #8217;s approach to Israel, where the group calls for boycotts of entire companies #8212;including unrelated divisions #8212;because some of their work is in settlements. It is also at odds with the record: Ms. Whitson #8217;s fundraising appeals for pro-settlement groups are in no way limited to educational issues. She has celebrated the work of the Armenian General Benevolent Union, which supports new settlement construction to encourage  #8220;young families to set down their roots. #8221; She specifically #160;praised the group for helping Syrian Armenians who have  #8220;resettled in Armenia #8221;; many or most such refugees have been resettled in the occupied territory. Ms. Whitson is fully within her rights to support Armenian settlements. Nothing in international law requires boycotts or sanctions against such communities. But if HRW were serious about its opposition to  #8220;settlers #8221; and  #8220;occupation, #8221; it wouldn #8217;t have a supporter of them heading its Middle East division. Ms. Whitson isn #8217;t alone in opposing occupation and settlements only in Israel. Nancy Kricorian, leader of a Code Pink boycott campaign against Israel, also turns out to be an Armenian settler activist. Michigan Rep. Rashida Tlaib urges a boycott of Israel while co-sponsoring a bill to normalize relations with Armenian settlements. The European Council on Foreign Relations has led efforts to restrict connections between Europe and Israeli activities in the West Bank. The think tank claims this is the clear and impersonal command of international law. Yet it has recently emerged that #160;some of its largest corporate donors have significant and direct business interests #160;in Moroccan-occupied Western Sahara and Turkish-occupied Northern Cyprus. The council doesn #8217;t seem bothered by connections to those occupied territories. Similarly, the revelations about Ms. Whitson will almost certainly not compromise her position at HRW or in the  #8220;antisettlement #8221; movement. This shows that there is more than a double standard at play. The acceptance of settlement activity by supporters of sanctions on Israel suggest they know that the international law they claim to enforce against the Jewish state is not international law at all. Mr. Kontorovich is a professor at George Mason University #8217;s Scalia Law School and a scholar at the Kohelet Policy Forum in Jerusalem.</TEXT>

    <TITLE>Persian Massacres of Iranian Azerbaijanis</TITLE>
    <DATE>2020-08-04 19:46:55</DATE>
    <TEXT>For this article, i will put citation for end of every important sentences and texts. Referecences and sources for every citation will be given below, after the end of article. Article will start quick information about "Pishavari Movement" and dissolution of this movement. Then it will be focused on entrance of Iranian army to Azerbaijan and start of persian massacres of Iranian Azerbaijanis. Again, sources will be given below.  #8203; ***AZERBAIJANI PEOPLE'S GOVERMENT*** The **Azerbaijan People's Government** (Azerbaijani: * #1570; #1584; #1585; #1576; #1575; #1740; #1580; #1575; #1606;  #1605; #1604; #1740;  #1581; #1705; #1608; #1605; #1578; #1740; - Az #601;rbaycan Milli H #246;kum #601;ti*; Persian:  #1581; #1705; #1608; #1605; #1578;  #1582; #1608; #1583; #1605; #1582; #1578; #1575; #1585;  #1570; #1584; #1585; #1576; #1575; #1740; #1580; #1575; #1606; #8206;) was a short-lived unrecognized secessionist state in northern Iran from November 1945 to December 1946. Established in Iranian Azerbaijan, the Azerbaijan People's Government capital was the city of Tabriz. Its establishment and demise were a part of the Iran crisis, which was a precursor to the Cold War. ***\[1\]*** In October 1943, Mir Ja #8217;far Pishevari, a seasoned journalist and political activist, was nominated from Azerbaijan to the Fourteenth Majlis of Iran. He was a 50-year-old native of Azerbaijan who had spent most of his life in Baku and had returned to Iran after the 1917 Bolshevik Revolution. Due to his antigovernment activities, he had been imprisoned by Reza Shah #8217;s regime for 12 years. After Reza Shah #8217;s fall, Pishevari, along with other political prisoners, had been set free. After his release, he went to Tehran and started a newspaper called Azhir \[The Siren\]. ***The people of Tabriz had voted for him unanimously.*** Despite his victory in Azerbaijan, the Iranian Majlis had rejected his candidacy on the grounds that he was a communist, a traitor, and disloyal to Iran #8217;s territorial integrity. Khoyi, another Azerbaijani deputy from the city of Tabriz, had met the same fate as Pishevari. ***The Azeris viewed the parliament #8217;s rejection of their elected candidates as a direct insult to their integrity and their nationality*** (JAMI, 1983). Following his rejection by the parliament, Pishevari entrusted the editorship of Azhir to friends and returned to Azerbaijan in August 1945 to form the Azerbaijan Democratic Party (Azerbaycan Demokrat Firqesi, ADF). On November 23, the Central Committee of the Azerbaijan Democratic Party issued a proclamation defining its aim as the obtainment of complete autonomy for Azerbaijan. The party made it clear that autonomy for Azerbaijan did not mean secession from Iran. ***The people of Tabriz warmly welcomed the formation of the Azerbaijan Democratic Party.*** Following the ADF #8217;s proclamation, a regional Congress of Azerbaijan that was composed of party supporters, designated a 39-membered commission to organize elections to a national assembly. On December 12, the provincial National Assembly was formally inaugurated in Tabriz. ***The assembly was composed of 101 deputies, all democrats and Azeri nationalists from various backgrounds such as workers and laborers, who were determined to demand autonomy for Azerbaijan*** (see also Atabaki, 1993, p. 129). As its first important task on the day of inauguration, the National Assembly proclaimed the autonomous Republic of Azerbaijan and designated a government under the premiership of Mir Ja #8217;far Pishevari, the founder of the Azerbaijan Democratic Party (ADF). The newly formed government of Azerbaijan announced that the autonomous state would be run on  #8220;democratic principles. #8221; It issued a program that granted women the right to vote; it announced that private property would be respected but that the government would distribute to landless farmers state-owned lands as well as the lands of reactionary landlords who had run away from Azerbaijan, as a result of the ongoing movement. Further, the government assured the Azerbaijani people that  #8220;traitors and reactionaries #8221; would be purged from the gendarmerie, that a  #8220;people #8217;s army #8221; would be formed from local militia groups, and that Azeri-Turkic would be the official language of the state. Simultaneously with the Azerbaijani movement, a Kurdish movement took place in the province of Kurdistan, west of Azerbaijan. On December 15, 1945, the Democratic Party of Kurdistan proclaimed a Kurdish People #8217;s Republic. ***\[2\]***  #8203; **D #304;SSOLUT #304;ON** the end of autonomy came in December 1946, a year after its emergence. A few days before the elections to the 15th Majles, Ahmad Qavam, the Iranian Prime Minister, informed the provincial government that Iranian Army troops would enter the province for the purpose of providing security for the elections. The ADP leadership knew that this was no ordinary mission. On December 9, 1946, in their letter to Moscow, the Iranian Azerbaijani leaders  #8220;repeat\[ed\] that from now on negotiations and agreements are of no use, #8221; and warned that they  #8220;have no doubt that Qavam is seriously preparing to destroy the Azerbaijani movement. #8221; Thus, they begged for military aid from the Soviet Union, without of which  #8220;such a situation can lead to gradually dying out and finally to complete destruction. #8221; As a result of the intense debate on how to respond to Tehran, the party leadership split into two camps. One group  #8220;argued that resistance would cause a senseless slaughter #8221; of the provincial forces, while the other, led by Pishevari,  #8220;proposed a prolonged guerilla campaign. #8221; The former won the support of the majority, and Azerbaijani officials ordered provincial forces to cease fire and surrender. ***\[2\]***  #8203; ***ENTRANCE OF THE  #304;RAN #304;AN ARMY AND START OF THE MASSACRES***  #8203; According to Tadeusz Swietochowski: ***\[3\]***  gt;As it turned out, the Soviets had to recognize that their ideas on Iran were premature. The issue of Iranian Azerbaijan became one of the opening skirmishes of the Cold War, and, largely under the Western powers' pressure, Soviet forces withdrew in 1946. The autonomous republic collapsed soon afterward, and the members of the Democratic Party took refuge in the Soviet Union, fleeing Iranian revenge. ***In Tabriz, the crowds that had just recently applauded the autonomous republic were now greeting the returning Iranian troops, and Azerbaijani students publicly burned their native-language textbooks. The mass of the population was obviously not ready even for a regional self-government so long as it smacked of separatism.***  #8203; the U.S. Consul in Tabriz observed: ***\[4\]*** *It was evident that people had no wish to fight and that leaders could count on little or no support. Today, it is as if we live in a different city. The pall is lifted. I have never seen so many smiling faces since I came to Azerbaijan.*  #8203; ***It is not plausible to ignore the fear factor; fear of punishment could have induced many Azerbaijanis ostensibly to welcome the return of the central government.*** ***The  #8220;uncontrollable violence #8221; threatened the lives of the sympathizers of the provincial government. -- gt; \[5\]*** On December 12, 1946, the remaining ADF leaders called on all Azerbaijanis to abandon resistance and allow the Iranian army a peaceful entry into Tabriz. Pishevari resigned from the government and left for Baku . The army, on the other hand, was anything but peaceful. Conscious and assured of nonresistance on the part of Azerbaijanis, the army, accompanied by gangs and thugs hired and armed by local landlords, entered Azerbaijan and savagely massacred its unarmed people:  #8203; *When the Persian Army returned to Azerbaijan, it came with a roar. Soldiers ran riot, looting and plundering, taking what they wanted. The Russian Army had been on its best behavior.* ***The Persian Army #8212;the army of emancipation #8212;was a savage army of occupation***\*. It left a brutal mark on the people.\* ***The beards of peasants were burned, their wives and daughters raped.*** *Houses were plundered; livestock was stolen. The Army was out of control. Its mission had been liberation, but it preyed on the civilians, leaving death and destruction behind.* (Douglas, 1951, p. 45) ***\[6\]***  #8203; *After the reoccupation of the provincial cities, the gallant central* ***Iranian troops inflicted mass "punishment" on innocent and defenceless people on the express orders of their high command and the supreme commander, Muhammad Reza Shah Pahlavi, himself.*** *There was wholesale* ***killing, burning, looting and rape.*** *For this time* ***Azerbijan had been invaded not by foreigners but by fellow Iranians!*** *Since then, 10 December, "the day of the Iranian army", has been a public holiday on which "the liberation of Azerbijan" is celebrated with pomp and circumstance.* ***\[7\]***  #8203; After the invasion of Azerbaijan, the shah #8217;s army marched into the neighboring Republic of Kurdistan. The leader of the Kurdistan Democratic Party, Qazi Mohammad, was hanged in Mhabad, along with his supporters. ***Mass executions of participants, sympathizers, and those suspected of supporting the national movements were performed in public, followed by the burning of books, magazines, and pamphlets published in ethnic languages.*** Shortly after the fall of national governments, the  #8220;book-burning ceremonies #8221; became a source of celebration and entertainment for the members of the dominant group and their invading army. ***The racist ruling elite made it clear that the book-burning rituals were conducted for the purpose of sealing the destiny of Azeri-Turkic in Iran once for all.***  #8203; As a boy growing up in Tabriz at the time, Professor Reza Baraheni recalls some painful memories regarding the book-burning ceremonies in his hometown:  #8203; *They forced us to take the books which were written in our mother tongue to the Shahrdari Square, and made us set the books on fire. The rising flames were reaching the feet of the men hanging from the gallows over our heads. After the fall of the Democratic Party, they would drag the Fadayis #8212;those who guarded Tabriz on days and asphalted its streets at night #8212;out of the houses, and* ***right in front of us kids of that period, they would order them to walk. . . . And then, right before our eyes, they would shoot them from behind and leave their bodies in the gutter. -- gt; \[8\]***  #8203; The world renowned north Azerbaijani poet Samad Vurghun recited a poem at the 1952 World Peace Congress held in Paris, by way of protesting the massacre of Azerbaijani people. The poem was titled  #8220;Yandirilan Kitablar #8221; \[ #8220;Books That Burned #8221;\] and was addressed to the shah of Iran who was referred to as  #8220;the butcher. #8221; ***\[9\]***  #8203; Eyewitnesses and unofficial Azerbaijani sources have estimated the number of people killed in Azerbaijan and Kurdistan during the occupation to be over 50, 000. ***\[10\]*** Estimates are that more than 15,000 people fled to Soviets Azerbaijan. ***\[11\]***  #8203; ***SOURCES AND REFERENCES:***  #8203; ***\[1\]*** [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Azerbaijan\_People%27s\_Government#cite\_note-24](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Azerbaijan_People%27s_Government#cite_note-24) ***\[2\]*** Alireza Asgharzadeh "Iran and the Challenge of Diversity" ***\[3\]*** Swietochowski, Tadeusz 1989.

    <TEXT> gt;First off, government calls us azeri not truk one question, did rouhani really called azerbaijanis as "turkish speaking persians" back in 2018? was [this news](https://www.dailysabah.com/mideast/2018/04/22/iranian-mps-of-turkish-origin-slam-rouhanis-aide-over-azeri-remarks) true? Edit: special assistant of Rouhani actually I hear you man, i live in turkey right now, i personally have a lot of iranian azerbaijani friends. My best friend is from Tabriz. They also say the same things. But, since they are in turkey for a long time, i personally wanted to know the situation right now, that is why i asked. Anyway, don't lose hope, fight for your rights, our language is beatiful, this is the language of nasimi, fuzuli, Shah Ismail. And, also, you guys remember that we azerbaijanis from north side of Araz River will always love you and will never forget you.

    <TEXT>here is what i found. According to wikipedia page of [demographics of Iran](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Demographics_of_Iran), population number of Iran was 60million in 1996. According to [Human Rights Watch reports of Iran in 1997](https://www.hrw.org/reports/1997/iran/Iran-06.htm), number of Azeri people is minimum 15million, maximum 20million. So it was minimum 25%, maximum 33.3% back in 1997 according to Human Rights Watch (HRW) reports. Edit: the numbers HRW gave, it was according to Iranian goverment if i am guessing correctly, because this was written in the report: "Information about human rights violations suffered by ethnic minorities in Iran is difficult to obtain and to verify. Unlike Iran's persecuted religious minorities, **the situations of its ethnic minorities are not closely monitored by international support groups**. It is difficult to gain access to many areas where the minorities reside, and the Iranian media does not report on issues of ethnic discrimination."</TEXT>

    <TEXT>For this article, i will put citation for end of every important sentences and texts. Referecences and sources for every citation will be given below, after the end of article. Article will start quick information about "Pishavari Movement" and dissolution of this movement. Then it will be focused on entrance of Iranian army to Azerbaijan and start of persian massacres of Iranian Azerbaijanis. Again, sources will be given below.  #8203; ***AZERBAIJANI PEOPLE'S GOVERMENT*** The **Azerbaijan People's Government** (Azerbaijani: * #1570; #1584; #1585; #1576; #1575; #1740; #1580; #1575; #1606;  #1605; #1604; #1740;  #1581; #1705; #1608; #1605; #1578; #1740; - Az #601;rbaycan Milli H #246;kum #601;ti*; Persian:  #1581; #1705; #1608; #1605; #1578;  #1582; #1608; #1583; #1605; #1582; #1578; #1575; #1585;  #1570; #1584; #1585; #1576; #1575; #1740; #1580; #1575; #1606; #8206;) was a short-lived unrecognized secessionist state in northern Iran from November 1945 to December 1946. Established in Iranian Azerbaijan, the Azerbaijan People's Government capital was the city of Tabriz. Its establishment and demise were a part of the Iran crisis, which was a precursor to the Cold War. ***\[1\]*** In October 1943, Mir Ja #8217;far Pishevari, a seasoned journalist and political activist, was nominated from Azerbaijan to the Fourteenth Majlis of Iran. He was a 50-year-old native of Azerbaijan who had spent most of his life in Baku and had returned to Iran after the 1917 Bolshevik Revolution. Due to his antigovernment activities, he had been imprisoned by Reza Shah #8217;s regime for 12 years. After Reza Shah #8217;s fall, Pishevari, along with other political prisoners, had been set free. After his release, he went to Tehran and started a newspaper called Azhir \[The Siren\]. ***The people of Tabriz had voted for him unanimously.*** Despite his victory in Azerbaijan, the Iranian Majlis had rejected his candidacy on the grounds that he was a communist, a traitor, and disloyal to Iran #8217;s territorial integrity. Khoyi, another Azerbaijani deputy from the city of Tabriz, had met the same fate as Pishevari. ***The Azeris viewed the parliament #8217;s rejection of their elected candidates as a direct insult to their integrity and their nationality*** (JAMI, 1983). Following his rejection by the parliament, Pishevari entrusted the editorship of Azhir to friends and returned to Azerbaijan in August 1945 to form the Azerbaijan Democratic Party (Azerbaycan Demokrat Firqesi, ADF). On November 23, the Central Committee of the Azerbaijan Democratic Party issued a proclamation defining its aim as the obtainment of complete autonomy for Azerbaijan. The party made it clear that autonomy for Azerbaijan did not mean secession from Iran. ***The people of Tabriz warmly welcomed the formation of the Azerbaijan Democratic Party.*** Following the ADF #8217;s proclamation, a regional Congress of Azerbaijan that was composed of party supporters, designated a 39-membered commission to organize elections to a national assembly. On December 12, the provincial National Assembly was formally inaugurated in Tabriz. ***The assembly was composed of 101 deputies, all democrats and Azeri nationalists from various backgrounds such as workers and laborers, who were determined to demand autonomy for Azerbaijan*** (see also Atabaki, 1993, p. 129). As its first important task on the day of inauguration, the National Assembly proclaimed the autonomous Republic of Azerbaijan and designated a government under the premiership of Mir Ja #8217;far Pishevari, the founder of the Azerbaijan Democratic Party (ADF). The newly formed government of Azerbaijan announced that the autonomous state would be run on  #8220;democratic principles. #8221; It issued a program that granted women the right to vote; it announced that private property would be respected but that the government would distribute to landless farmers state-owned lands as well as the lands of reactionary landlords who had run away from Azerbaijan, as a result of the ongoing movement. Further, the government assured the Azerbaijani people that  #8220;traitors and reactionaries #8221; would be purged from the gendarmerie, that a  #8220;people #8217;s army #8221; would be formed from local militia groups, and that Azeri-Turkic would be the official language of the state. Simultaneously with the Azerbaijani movement, a Kurdish movement took place in the province of Kurdistan, west of Azerbaijan. On December 15, 1945, the Democratic Party of Kurdistan proclaimed a Kurdish People #8217;s Republic. ***\[2\]***  #8203; **D #304;SSOLUT #304;ON** the end of autonomy came in December 1946, a year after its emergence. A few days before the elections to the 15th Majles, Ahmad Qavam, the Iranian Prime Minister, informed the provincial government that Iranian Army troops would enter the province for the purpose of providing security for the elections. The ADP leadership knew that this was no ordinary mission. On December 9, 1946, in their letter to Moscow, the Iranian Azerbaijani leaders  #8220;repeat\[ed\] that from now on negotiations and agreements are of no use, #8221; and warned that they  #8220;have no doubt that Qavam is seriously preparing to destroy the Azerbaijani movement. #8221; Thus, they begged for military aid from the Soviet Union, without of which  #8220;such a situation can lead to gradually dying out and finally to complete destruction. #8221; As a result of the intense debate on how to respond to Tehran, the party leadership split into two camps. One group  #8220;argued that resistance would cause a senseless slaughter #8221; of the provincial forces, while the other, led by Pishevari,  #8220;proposed a prolonged guerilla campaign. #8221; The former won the support of the majority, and Azerbaijani officials ordered provincial forces to cease fire and surrender. ***\[2\]***  #8203;  #8203; ***ENTRANCE OF THE  #304;RAN #304;AN ARMY AND START OF THE MASSACRES*** According to Tadeusz Swietochowski: ***\[3\]***  gt;As it turned out, the Soviets had to recognize that their ideas on Iran were premature. The issue of Iranian Azerbaijan became one of the opening skirmishes of the Cold War, and, largely under the Western powers' pressure, Soviet forces withdrew in 1946. The autonomous republic collapsed soon afterward, and the members of the Democratic Party took refuge in the Soviet Union, fleeing Iranian revenge. ***In Tabriz, the crowds that had just recently applauded the autonomous republic were now greeting the returning Iranian troops, and Azerbaijani students publicly burned their native-language textbooks. The mass of the population was obviously not ready even for a regional self-government so long as it smacked of separatism.*** the U.S. Consul in Tabriz observed: ***\[4\]*** *It was evident that people had no wish to fight and that leaders could count on little or no support. Today, it is as if we live in a different city. The pall is lifted. I have never seen so many smiling faces since I came to Azerbaijan.* ***It is not plausible to ignore the fear factor; fear of punishment could have induced many Azerbaijanis ostensibly to welcome the return of the central government.*** ***The  #8220;uncontrollable violence #8221; threatened the lives of the sympathizers of the provincial government. -- gt; \[5\]*** On December 12, 1946, the remaining ADF leaders called on all Azerbaijanis to abandon resistance and allow the Iranian army a peaceful entry into Tabriz. Pishevari resigned from the government and left for Baku . The army, on the other hand, was anything but peaceful. Conscious and assured of nonresistance on the part of Azerbaijanis, the army, accompanied by gangs and thugs hired and armed by local landlords, entered Azerbaijan and savagely massacred its unarmed people: *When the Persian Army returned to Azerbaijan, it came with a roar. Soldiers ran riot, looting and plundering, taking what they wanted. The Russian Army had been on its best behavior.* ***The Persian Army #8212;the army of emancipation #8212;was a savage army of occupation***\*. It left a brutal mark on the people.\* ***The beards of peasants were burned, their wives and daughters raped.*** *Houses were plundered; livestock was stolen. The Army was out of control. Its mission had been liberation, but it preyed on the civilians, leaving death and destruction behind.* (Douglas, 1951, p. 45) ***\[6\]*** *After the reoccupation of the provincial cities, the gallant central* ***Iranian troops inflicted mass "punishment" on innocent and defenceless people on the express orders of their high command and the supreme commander, Muhammad Reza Shah Pahlavi, himself.*** *There was wholesale* ***killing, burning, looting and rape.*** *For this time* ***Azerbijan had been invaded not by foreigners but by fellow Iranians!*** *Since then, 10 December, "the day of the Iranian army", has been a public holiday on which "the liberation of Azerbijan" is celebrated with pomp and circumstance.* ***\[7\]*** After the invasion of Azerbaijan, the shah #8217;s army marched into the neighboring Republic of Kurdistan. The leader of the Kurdistan Democratic Party, Qazi Mohammad, was hanged in Mhabad, along with his supporters. ***Mass executions of participants, sympathizers, and those suspected of supporting the national movements were performed in public, followed by the burning of books, magazines, and pamphlets published in ethnic languages.*** Shortly after the fall of national governments, the  #8220;book-burning ceremonies #8221; became a source of celebration and entertainment for the members of the dominant group and their invading army. ***The racist ruling elite made it clear that the book-burning rituals were conducted for the purpose of sealing the destiny of Azeri-Turkic in Iran once for all.***  #8203; As a boy growing up in Tabriz at the time, Professor Reza Baraheni recalls some painful memories regarding the book-burning ceremonies in his hometown: *They forced us to take the books which were written in our mother tongue to the Shahrdari Square, and made us set the books on fire. The rising flames were reaching the feet of the men hanging from the gallows over our heads. After the fall of the Democratic Party, they would drag the Fadayis #8212;those who guarded Tabriz on days and asphalted its streets at night #8212;out of the houses, and* ***right in front of us kids of that period, they would order them to walk. . . . And then, right before our eyes, they would shoot them from behind and leave their bodies in the gutter. -- gt; \[8\]***  #8203; The world renowned north Azerbaijani poet Samad Vurghun recited a poem at the 1952 World Peace Congress held in Paris, by way of protesting the massacre of Azerbaijani people. The poem was titled  #8220;Yandirilan Kitablar #8221; \[ #8220;Books That Burned #8221;\] and was addressed to the shah of Iran who was referred to as  #8220;the butcher. #8221; ***\[9\]*** Eyewitnesses and unofficial Azerbaijani sources have estimated the number of people killed in Azerbaijan and Kurdistan during the occupation to be over 50, 000. ***\[10\]*** Estimates are that more than 15,000 people fled to Soviets Azerbaijan. ***\[11\]***  #8203; ***SOURCES AND REFERENCES:*** ***\[1\]*** [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Azerbaijan\_People%27s\_Government#cite\_note-24](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Azerbaijan_People%27s_Government#cite_note-24) ***\[2\]*** Alireza Asgharzadeh "Iran and the Challenge of Diversity" ***\[3\]*** Swietochowski, Tadeusz 1989.

    <TEXT>yeah, i understand you. The thing is i did check one of the sources (HRW 1997). Here i am gonna copy paste my comment: According to wikipedia page of [demographics of Iran](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Demographics_of_Iran), population number of Iran was 60million in 1996. In [Human Rights Watch reports of Iran in 1997](https://www.hrw.org/reports/1997/iran/Iran-06.htm) (one of sources of author), it was said: "The situation of Iran's ***fifteen*** to ***twenty*** million Azari minority differs in almost every respect from that of the Kurds." So it was minimum 25%, maximum 33.3% back in 1997 according to Human Rights Watch (HRW) reports. Edit: the numbers HRW gave, it was according to Iranian goverment if i am guessing correctly, because this was written in the report: "Information about human rights violations suffered by ethnic minorities in Iran is difficult to obtain and to verify. Unlike Iran's persecuted religious minorities, **the situations of its ethnic minorities are not closely monitored by international support groups**. It is difficult to gain access to many areas where the minorities reside, and the Iranian media does not report on issues of ethnic discrimination."</TEXT>

    <TEXT>It is indeed interesting topic "thanks" to Iran. Even Iran itself do not give real numbers. They say one thing, then they say another. Even the third parties have different numbers. You can't really know what the exact real number is. There is also assimilation policy. But i do think that Iran give lower numbers, since it is basically dictatorship. For example, i think our goverment also gives lower numbers for ethnic minorities, since it is also dictatorship regime.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Normally i try not respond to this kind of immature, dick measuring type of comments but you know what? Fuck it. The most famous armenian in MMA and Ufc history is Edmond "Head movement" Tarverdyan. He is considered as ***one of the worst coaches in Ufc History***. Lol Now, speaking about azeri fighters we do have pretty good fighters like Rafael Agayev in karate (***5 world championship, 11 europe championship***), Eduard Memmedov in kickboxing (***25 world championship, 7 european championship in different tournaments***), Elnur Memmedov in Judo (***2 euro champion, 1 Olympic champion with 13seconds win in final game***), Tofiq Musayev (***Mma Rizin champion with 2 wins with one day)***, Rafael fiziev ***(newborn killer in ufc lightweight, just had a win 3weeks ago***). Ferid Mansurov (***greco-roman olympic champion***). These guys are just a couple of guys. I could go on ***but instead of insulting and dick measuring each others nation by acting like a fucking spoiled teenager brat, we could just set aside our differences, act with maturity.*** How about that?</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I do not give a slight single fuck about medes or seljuks or other dynasties or turkey. I am actually the one who oppose Tukish influence on my own country (RoA) because i do not want my people to lose their language and speak "gidiyorum, yapiyorum" like a fucking retard, while they have their own language. The language that was spoken and under that language poems have been written by Shah ismail, Nasimi, fuzuli and etc. About ethnic identity, everybody has their own ethnic identity and all should be respected. Nobody have to call different ethnic name to that person if that person do not want to be called like that. Simple as that. Pahlavi regime was truly horrible. Thanks at least regocnize it unlike your majority persian companions on reddit who worship pahlavis like some fucking god, then wondering around like a dumbass why seperatism is growing in Iran. But you are the minority though, because according to latest [survey](https://twitter.com/AmmarMaleki/status/1006579135735521280) on more than 19k people, majority people wants last pahlavi's son to come back. And the thing is out of 5 sources i gave, 3 of them was happened in 21st century, not during pahlavi time. Oh, i forgot, here is [this one](https://www.reddit.com/r/azerbaijan/comments/i4asjw/iran_arrests_azerbaijani_activists_demanding/), happened just a couple of days ago against iranian azerbaijanis. check the comment of iranian azerbaijani, he thinks very differently than you just as my best friend who is iranian azerbaijani and all of my other iranian azerbaijani friends and the iranian azerbaijani moderator (u/espadavictoriosa) of this sub. Now, back to topic , again 3 source out 5 was happened in 21st century. I mean penalizing students in school for speaking their own language, even in the schoolyards (5th source), i mean wtf? What the actual fucking fuck? You know, you guys have a lot common with 20th century's turkey. As you can see pahlavi's racism still continues. You have to understand attacking somebody's ethnic identity, try to change it is not gonna help, it actually will provoke seperatism just as how it is happening in turkey by calling kurds-mountain turks in 20th century, and just as how it is slowly (or rapidly??) starting happening in iran. It clearly is not working. But at least respecting their ethic identity would be helpful.  gt;balkanizing Iran and turkey Turkey actually would oppose it because after iran next target would be turkey. And turkey being splitted would be bad for us politically. It would be not helpful for us, that's why I oppose that unless southerners really wants it. So, we three countries (Iran, Turkey, Azerbaijan) are bound to stick together, even though all of us hate one another for actually good reasons. Anyway, my point is, do not attack their ethnic identity, do not call azerbaijanis [turkish speaking persians](https://www.dailysabah.com/mideast/2018/04/22/iranian-mps-of-turkish-origin-slam-rouhanis-aide-over-azeri-remarks), if they do not want you to call them like that. Firstly respect their ethnic identity and at least give them their linguistical rights. But balkanizing iran is a dream (more realistic one though), just like yours for asking us to be part of iran, big fucking looool for that one. Thank you for make me laugh so, by acting like pan-iranist low-iq nationalist. In fact balkanizing iran has a lot more fucking chance than us at least wanted to be part of iran. So, take your wet dream and shove it up to one tight body part of yours.  #8203;  gt;There's systemic racism in America. Who is calling for the balkanization of America and millions of deaths? There's racism in Britain Whataboutism. Fucking pathetic</TEXT>

You act like a sheep being led to slaughter, your ideas removing you from history and filling up the void of identity in you with some ethnocentric myth that will lead to death and destruction to line up politicians pockets. Says the persian, lol. I gave you facts, showed you facts about racism in Iran against Iranian Azerbaijanis, your answer was threatining me and calling me sheep? lol. Sure, we are livin under dictatorship. I do not deny that. But it is still much better than living under Iran Islamic Terrorist state. So instead of blame us being a sheep, check your own country and your own people and check yourself too. "ehnocentric myth"-- gt; says the guy whose country are famous for aryanist racism, no wonder why Hitler loved you guys. How iranic that you call my country "Iranzamin", you want me to join your islamic terrorist state, but when i refuse i suddenly become a sheep lol. ***Your pan-iranist, nationalistic dreams of "Big Iran" blinds you from logic. You act like a sheep being led to slaughter.***  gt;you're being sold to hate your own people Lol. Pathetic. Now, beg me again to be part of iran. I did like when you beg me to join Iran islam terrorist state. Anyway, keep your delusional, pathetic aryanist, Big Iran dreams to yourself. You know, people like you have a lot in common with other group called "pan-turkists".</TEXT>

Sen heqiqeten bizim bu cur sikik  #246;lkede yasamagimizi isteyirsen??? Now answer my question on azeri language. Let's see if you are azeri or another pan-iranist persian bot who claim to be azeri, but do not know the language. I have seen tons of them in here.

Sure, my country is shithole too, but compare to yours, it is fucking heaven. Your country is fucked up. Economy is dying, seperatism increasing, ethnic tensions are getting high, specially between kurds and azeris, i also wrote about racism in iran in azeri language, so google translate that my "azeri" friend.  gt;You're like a child.

    <TEXT>The source that you gave is very unreliable source, i have never even heard about this news site. I checked all the main opposition sources, including the most reliable ones, [meydantv](https://www.meydan.tv/en/), [bbc azerbaycanca](https://www.bbc.com/azeri) and [Azadliq.org](https://www.azadliq.org/), could not find any news about this topic. Remind you that sources like "meydantv" and "azadliq.org" got banned in azerbaijan according to my knowledge. The news site you gave did also mention something like "Earlier in social networks" about the news of two underage raped girls. Now, question can be asked to unknown writer, which social networks? This is a very serious accusations, so why dont you show that social networks? Why dont you show exactly where you got that from? Because i did check social networks, facebook pages. Hell, i even check the iranaphone, the most turcophobe pages of "khomeini shia lovers" of Azerbaijan. Still could not found anything about it. Now, about the source you gave, i did found their youtube page. [This](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCtdBV-c0bsIJShFTaMZj5Bg) is their youtube page with only 3 subscribers. LoL. [This](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7VBVoWDJbk4) is one of their "serious" videos. Just check out the first 5-6 seconds of video, you will get an idea how "serious" this news site is. So, my advise to you, do not believe everything you hear. But if you have ***reliable*** sources about this topic, you are free to show me.</TEXT>

    <TEXT> gt;Is that really the case that Armenians said it first As a person who lives with turks for almost seven years, i can say, yep, that is exactly the case.  gt;Arabic name suggests it was neither Armenians nor Turks. Also given that there is evidence that lahmajun was popularized both in Turkey and in Eastern Armenia only in the 20th century, spreading to both from South Eastern Turkey and Aleppo repatriates to Armenia respectively, the dish almost certainly originated somewhere in the Aleppo region, hence the  #8220;Turkic cuisine #8221; in your meme is questionable. Oh, boy, why am i not suprised you made it armenian dish. First call it arabic (which is more logical actually, i personally agree with you on arabic part), then hippity, hoppity, it is armenian food now. Lol. I have never seen turks call it tukish pizza, until i saw their frustrations and discussions on social media about how armenians introduce it to world as an armenian pizza. After that i saw them start calling it turkish pizza. Normally they always call it just lahmajun. But you guys delibirately introduce it to foreigners as an armenian pizza just like how you introduced churchkela to russians as an armenian sucuk and napoleon dessert as an armenian dessert . I mean come on maaan :d By the way, read my comments again i have never said it is turkish food. For me it is eastern food, mainly can be seen in post-ottoman countries but if i had to choose who it belong, i would probably choose arabs.</TEXT>

    <TEXT> gt;That is simply not true. I hope you are not going to cite outdated dubious  #171;genetic research #187;. The truth is that the data on Azerbaijani Turks is very insufficent. However, dna test results Azerbaijani individuals have posted on internet shows that Azerbaijani Turks have around 10% dna from Asia (including Siberia, non-existent among non Turkic groups) which is also the case for Anatolian Turks. Now you have to keep in mind that this doesn #8217;t mean Azerbaijanis are only  #171;10% Turkic #187;, since Oghuz settlers weren #8217;t 100% Asian. Moreover, those tests only go back 500 years. As you know the Turkic migration is older than that, yet you still find considerable Asian genetic trace compared to non-Turkic groups.  gt;  gt;If you want, I can invite a Persian Iranian from an ancestry sub here, and he can explain in depth. He is much more knowledgeable about the genetic stuff.  #8203; This is the comment of u/Atsuz. Can you explain genetics of Azerbaijanis in depth with sources, if you have time and if it is ok for you, of course :)</TEXT>

    <TEXT>*English translation*: Armenian armed forces have once again resorted to provocation in the direction of the Tovuz region of the Armenian-Azerbaijani state border. APA TV's local bureau reports that civilians and settlements in Aghdam village were fired upon by the enemy. Large-caliber bullets damaged a house in the village. The house of Lachin Bagirova, a resident of the village, was damaged by constant fire. Enemy militants also fired on residents engaged in agricultural activities in the village. As a result of adequate response and punitive measures of our army, the enemy's firing points were silenced. In general, the operational conditions in the frontline areas are under the control of our army.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>***Fuzuli*** On August 23, 1993, the center of Fizuli region and more than 50 villages were occupied in those days. There are 13 settlements and 20 villages in the liberated area of  #8203; #8203;the region. Twelve of the settlements were newly built in the liberated area, and IDP families were temporarily housed in those settlements. Currently, more than 51,000 IDPs are said to be living in the area. In total, more than 1,000 people are said to have died during the Karabakh conflict in the Fizuli region. ***Jabrayil*** On August 23, the Armenian armed forces also occupied the Jabrayil region. This region has an area of  #8203; #8203;1,050 square kilometers. About 200 people were killed, 91 were missing and 177 were disabled during the occupation. In general, 20 percent of Azerbaijani lands are under occupation. It is said that complex socio-political processes took place in Azerbaijan during the occupation of Fizuli and Jabrayil regions. About two months before those occupations, military unit N under the leadership of Colonel Surat Huseynov in Ganja took up arms against the authorities. President Abulfaz Elchibey's government was overthrown and he left Baku. Instead, Chairman of the Supreme Assembly of the Nakhchivan Autonomous Republic Heydar Aliyev was elected Chairman of the Milli Majlis of Azerbaijan. Later, Colonel S. Huseynov was brought to the post of Prime Minister at the suggestion of H. Aliyev. The Karabakh conflict began in 1988 with Armenia's territorial claims to Azerbaijan. Prior to the ceasefire agreement reached in 1994, the Nagorno-Karabakh region of Azerbaijan and 7 adjacent regions were occupied. Peace talks on the Nagorno-Karabakh conflict are being held through the mediation of the OSCE Minsk Group. The United States, Russia and France are co-chairs of the group. ***Source:*** [https://www.azadliq.org/a/30798053.html](https://www.azadliq.org/a/30798053.html)</TEXT>

    <TEXT>That 19th century itself was a lose-lose situation to Qajars. In the first era of the century, there is a war with russians during industrial revolution times. In the second half of century there was a increasment of nationalism, national awakening. Gajars did really come to power in a very bad times. Pahlavi taking over was kind of inevitable too, because nationalism was rising and Qajars were azerbaijanis (turks). But majority of the country were Persians. And to add for that, there are sources indicates that Shah himself did not really like persians and always considers himself as an Azerbaijani turk. For example, according to memories of General Ivan Osipovic Simonic, who was Russia's ambassador to Iran during 1832-1838: *"he is always on the alert against his own* \*\*\*\[163\]\*\*\**domestic enemies and always at his fingertips and even in the audience hall, a lot of loaded weapons. He does not like the Persians, and if he does not trust them, then even less does he trust the representatives of the flame from which he himself comes. He is ashamed of his origin and considers himself an Azerbaijani Turk. Therefore, he considers the inhabitants of this country as his only compatriots, and it is they who make up his closest circle."*  gt;[Th #305;s Source](http://www.vostlit.info/Texts/Dokumenty/Persien/XIX/1820-1840/Simonic_I_O/text4.phtml?fbclid=IwAR2XA0KP0Vom8DldlBUrFXJc72IRVd8egp8iRzP4cCi8W9CIX8kVv3F__88) report is in russian, but you can translate it with google translate And the funny thing is, Simonic actually thought that qajars were ethnic persians and got suprised how Gajar shah considers himself as an Azerbaijani turk and how he chooses Azerbaijanis over persians.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Qajars are not liked in Azerbaijan too, In here people talk Afsars, Safavids, shah ismail all the time, but when it comes to qajars, people say, no he was persianated turk. But the thing is he was not. I try to explain people that it was indeed Azerbaijanis who lose Northern part, not persians. It was azerbaijanis who were rulers, and they also considered themselves azerbaijani not persian. Majority of Army also consisted of us, not persian. They just don't wanna accept gajars, lol. Poor gajars  #8203;  gt;Either way, after the first Muhammad Shah the Qajars definitely saw themself as Iranians. It could be, but there are some sources indicate different things. Do you know that nesreddin mirza (who become sah aftar mohammed shah Gajar) did not know how to talk persian when he became a king. *"Nasreddin Shah Gajar enjoyed speaking in his mother tongue: "Nasreddin Mirza could not speak Persian when he ascended the throne in Tabriz in 1848. Brown added that even after his accession to the throne in 1848, he preferred to speak Turkish with those closest to him. Browne, "A Year Amongst the Persians," p. 108. Describing the relationship between Mushiruddov and Nasreddin Shah, Dust Ali Khan writes: "I often witnessed the Shah's long conversations with him in Turkish. He almost enjoyed it."* J. D. Clark, "The History of the Iranian Province of Azerbaijan, 1848-1914", page. 34 The "Brown" guy that was mentioned in here is the author of the book named"A Year Amongst the Persians ", 1887-1888  #8203; Also in gajars, majority of army was consisted of azerbaijani turks. According to military reports, gajars did not give persians a chance and chosed azerbaijani turks over persians. For example: *"About the Turks and Persians in the Gajar army: "It should be noted that the Turks' moral resilience, loyalty, courage and strong physique have become a proverb, and history shows that a good soldier can be taken from him. As a soldier, no one cares about a Persian in his own country, and he can only serve as a policeman in the countryside and in areas where the Turkic tribes are disgusted."* "Military Report on Persia" (1912), page. 221</TEXT>

    <TEXT> gt;I tried with a bunch of the photos there and they don't appear anywhere else on the web. Waybackmachine only has one instance of that page from June 2020, nothing appears prior. I mean, you said 2020, the data of the link is 2016, anyway i am gonna translate material from azerbaijani to english. I mean, perhaps this could explain something: "Despite the terrible level of massacre committed by the Armenians, in the following years, neither state bodies, nor domestic and foreign media did much. Even simple information is not found in non-electronic and electronic media. The materials and facts of the criminal case opened in connection with this massacre committed by Armenians are kept in the Memorial Genocide Museum of the Military Prosecutor's Office of the Republic of Azerbaijan. The museum has a collage of several photos taken after the massacre and a very brief information. Only a long time later, in 2013, in a special issue of "Lachin Yurdu"  #8470;2 (9) magazine "Our Martyrs Oath" and in 2016 in "Lachin Yurdu"  #8470;1 (19) magazine, a little about this massacre. , reported. On the basis of these materials, our valuable intellectual Araz Yaguboglu posted information on the "Azerbaijani Wikipedia". We continue to work in this direction."</TEXT>

    <TEXT> gt;I can't find any confirming evidence for this. I mean, data have been shown in the link. And also i have found another links from 2016, [This one](http://femida.az/az/news/32775) for example has a data of 26th July, 2016, 19:43. and about on of my early comments about credibility of photos: what i meant is that, if these photos were from different massacres and is used as photos from balliqaya by goverment, it could have been shown in google when it is checked in [images.google.com](https://images.google.com), but eveything about these photos is pointed to balliqaya, at least on google. And from the material i translated, it is said that, this massacre is mentioned in 2013 and in 2016 in "Lachin Yurdu" magazine. I am trying to find 2013 edition, but i did find 2016 edition of magazine in archive. I am gonna show translation and source below and by the way i did translation myself, since google translate had a lot of mistakes so if something is not understandable because of writing in here, i apologise: "In the last days of August 1992, 6 families living as IDPs (Abdullayev Abdulla Badal oglu, Almammedov Shamil Almammad oglu, Humbatov Eyvaz Ismayil oglu, Humbatov Vazir Ismayil oglu, Mehdiyev Humbat Abulgasim oglu, Mehdiyev Ma- Hammad Abulqasim's family) were settled in Balligaya village of Goranboy region in a ***tent***, in the area called Gulustan, in order to create favorable conditions for livestock. On the morning of August 28, 1992, three days after the settlement, A sabotage group created by the Armenian Armed Forces at around 5 p.m. 10-12 member booths with special ruthlessness, large-caliber weapons and fired grenades. As a result of the shooting, 25 civilians were killed was killed, 5 were seriously injured and 4 were slightly injured. It was opened in connection with this massacre committed by Armenians Materials and facts of the criminal case Military Procurator of the Republic of Azerbaijan. It is preserved in the Memorial Genocide Museum. [https://archive.org/stream/LacinYurdu19/lacin%20yurdu-19\_djvu.txt](https://archive.org/stream/LacinYurdu19/lacin%20yurdu-19_djvu.txt)... The text in page 15, you can see the number "15" in text Also, one thing got my attention is, in this text, it is said that these people were IDPs and lived in tents in balliqaya.(thats why i put black letters to a word "tent"). Here is [one photo from balliqaya](https://az.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ball%C4%B1qaya_soyq%C4%B1r%C4%B1m%C4%B1_(1992)#/media/%C5%9E%C9%99kil:Ball%C4%B1qayada_soyq%C4%B1r%C4%B1m_1.jpg), and in that photo, there is tent in the background, i mean, it kind of looked like a tent.</TEXT>

    <TEXT> #8203;  gt;An argument could be that the nation which represents them, the state in their name did the bad deeds. So it's apologising for something that was done in their name. The thing is, this argument is not a good one. A person did not ask for state to do it for their name, hell, most or half of the people were not even born at that times (depending on massacres, genocides). A state or soldiers of state is the one who did it for the name of nation, not a random guy from that nation. So state, is the one who should apologise and people who *personally* have done massacres or genocide should be jailed if they are alive  #8203;  gt;I believe it is more important to acknowledge things and agree that they are bad, and shouldn't be repeated. Exactly, that is the point. Acknowledgement is the key, not apologising for something you personally have not been part of. In my eyes, a person is a egoist, hypocrite if that person demand apology from a random guy (unless that random guy have done it personally) for something happened 30-50 or 100 hundred years ago. But Denying and start making some conspiracy theories about genocide or massacre is just wrong.  #8203;  gt;Our region loves conspiracies. Justified or not. They do not just love it, they adore it. I have seen or talk on both sides who love to do conspiracy theories. Some of them have been brainwashed and some of them do it on purpose.  #8203;  gt;A better viewpoint imho is to also have the opinion that perpetrators should face justice regardless. I hold this view. Unfortunately I don't think any of this is going to happen because in the case of the Karabakh conflict both sides need to work things out in tandem The key to peace is to acknowledge what people of our nation have done to other side. I mean just a month ago, when the clashes occures between armenian-azerbaijani diaspora, there is an azerbaijani women journalist have been injured. I remember one dude in armenia subreddit told me something like, armenians would *never* hurt any women or children. Now, that is bullshit. Don't get me wrong, there are people in azerbaijani side too, who think the same way about their own people as this dude. But being a murderer or horrible person is not really dependant on you being azerbaijani or armenian. You see, that is the problem, both side think that they are some kind of angels and opposite side are demons. Edit: I do not get why you are getting downvoted. What you say is true.</TEXT>

And before posting these photos, i myself have checked these photos using [images.google.com](https://images.google.com). And all the searches are directed towards articles about Balliqaya, i mean you can search it yourself if you want. I did not find any posts which shows these photos on different massacres, i mean at least on google. Most armenians in here says that, this is from azeri sources so unreliable or some says it is aliyev propaganda and etc.(typical stuff). Yeah, well, anybody can think like that. But photos are here, and if it is proven that these photos are from different massacres and are used as photos from balliqaya by goverment as propaganda, then i will delete the post. But if it is not proven, then it stays</TEXT>

    <TEXT> gt;So Turks from Turkey understand North Azerbaijani easily, but they can #8217;t understand Iranian Azerbaijani very well. "easily" would not be right word, lets say "better". The closest language to Azerbaijani is actually Turkmen language. The thing about turkish language is that, it started "changing" in beginning of 20th centuries. But if you go to places like Igdir, Kars, even in Erzurum, people in that cities mainly talks dialect of Azerbaijani language, they even identify themself as Azerbaijani.  #8203;  gt;But then people from North and South Azerbaijan understand each other easily? I personally met a lot of South Azerbaijanis, i can understand them very good, especially Tabrizians, i even can talk in South Azerbaijani dialect. It really depends on which cities in Iran, Azerbaijanis live. For example, Azerbaijanis from Ardabil, Tabriz speak Azerbaijani much more fluently and better than Azerbaijanis who lives in different cities of Iran where kurds and persians also live.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>*English translation:* Tamar Bachaliashvili's parents and relatives held a rally. The body of 23-year-old Tamar Bachaliashvili, who went missing with his car on July 18, was found in Georgia after a five-day search. The body was found in the back seat of her car, 65 km from Tbilisi. The girl's parents held a rally in front of the Georgian Prosecutor General's Office yesterday. Contrary to the official version, the parents claim that their daughter was not killed and did not commit suicide. According to her parents, Tamar was an IT specialist, and she received information about the smuggling of weapons to Karabakh via Georgia and the involvement of high-ranking Georgian officials in the process, which is why her daughters were killed. The parents called on the Turkish and Azerbaijani authorities to pay attention to this issue and demand information from Georgia about the case. The Georgian opposition is already using this topic for pre-election propaganda. The investigation continues, I think the Azerbaijani public should keep this issue in the spotlight.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>***His philantropic work*** Despite the decades of anti-bourgeois Soviet propaganda that followed his lifetime, Taghiyev is revered by Azerbaijanis for his charity work. He sponsored the construction of the first Azerbaijani national theatre in 1883 (known as Taghiyev's Theatre, and later the [Azerbaijan State Theatre of Musical Comedy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Azerbaijan_State_Theatre_of_Musical_Comedy)) and helped to repair it after reactionists burned it down in 1909. In 1911, he covered all the expenses for the construction of what would later become the [Azerbaijan State Academic Opera and Ballet Theatre](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Azerbaijan_State_Academic_Opera_and_Ballet_Theatre).[\[4\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zeynalabdin_Taghiyev#cite_note-suleymanov-4) Taghiyev provided 184,000 roubles to build the first [secular Muslim school for girls](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baku_Muslim_Girls_School) in the [Middle East](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Middle_East) in 1898 #8211;1900. He personally obtained the permission to build the school in his correspondence with [Empress Alexandra](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alexandra_Fyodorovna_(Alix_of_Hesse)). He also sponsored the construction of a school of agriculture in Mardakan in 1894 and the first technical school in the [Baku Governorate](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baku_Governorate) in 1911.[\[1\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zeynalabdin_Taghiyev#cite_note-vyshka-1) Taghiyev helped to maintain many city institutions and contributed to the adornment of Baku, including laying out of parks and paving the streets. For this, he provided a 35-year loan of 750,000 roubles to the City Council in 1895. Together with five other businessmen, he financially assisted in establishing the [horse tramway](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Horse_tramway) in Baku, which started functioning in 1892.[\[4\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zeynalabdin_Taghiyev#cite_note-suleymanov-4) He helped to solve the [water crisis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Water_crisis) in the city by helping to finance the Shollar water pipeline, which channeled water 100 miles away in the [Caucasus Mountains](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caucasus_Mountains), near [Quba](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quba), via a ceramic pipeline.

Taghiyev ordered the necessary equipment from [Leipzig](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leipzig) and sponsored the translation and the publishing.[\[1\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zeynalabdin_Taghiyev#cite_note-vyshka-1) Taghiyev also allocated 11,000 roubles for the construction of the head office for the Muslim Benevolent Society in [Saint Petersburg](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saint_Petersburg); 3,000 roubles for the education of [Armenian](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Armenians) orphans; 5,000 for the St. Nina's School for Girls in Baku; 10,000 roubles for the construction of the [Alexander Nevsky Cathedral](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alexander_Nevsky_Cathedral,_Baku) in Baku; tens of thousands of roubles for the construction and repair of mosques and [madrasas](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Madrasa) throughout Russia and Persia.,[\[2\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zeynalabdin_Taghiyev#cite_note-ai-2) etc. In the 19th century, the territory of modern [Pakistan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pakistan) was occupied by British troops.

Experts say that there are two clinical varieties of plague - bubonic and pneumonic. A flea bite may cause the first one, while the second one is a severe version of bubonic plague. The worst thing is that pneumonic plague spreads like a flu and has 100% mortality rate. Over 100 thousand people died from the rapidly spreading deadly disease. It was possible to defeat this disease only by vaccinating those who had not yet fallen ill. And that' when Hajji Zeynalabdin Taghiyev bought and sent over 300 thousand ampoules of vaccine to [Pakistan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pakistan), which played a major role in the victory over this deadly disease.

Also, it is written something like "Long live my Tractor, long live Azerbaijan" with arabic alphabet [in the official twitter account of Tractor FC](https://twitter.com/TractorOfficial).

    <TEXT>Turkey has gone through a rough foreign policy patch over the past few years, feuding variously with the United States, Europe, Russia, and much of the Arab world. So is its only remaining friend Azerbaijan? That seems to be the conclusion of a [new survey](http://ctrs.khas.edu.tr/sources/TDP-2017(EN)_vfinal.pdf), the annual #160;Public Perceptions on Turkish Foreign Policy report by Kadir Has University in Istanbul. To the question, "Which country is Turkey's closest 'friend,'" fully 71 percent of Turks said Azerbaijan. In a distant second place was Pakistan, with a mere two percent. #160; Azerbaijan's friend rating has been rising steadily since the poll began: from 28 percent in 2013, to 37 percent in 2015, to 59 percent in 2016. That was mirrored in the results to another question, "With which countries Turkey should cooperate in implementing its foreign policy?" Azerbaijan also held the top spot there, with 59 percent, and also has been steadily improving since 2013, when only 12 percent said that. A related answer, "Turkic countries," was the second most common response, at 37 percent, a number that also has been rising significantly since 2013. ("Muslim countries" was third at 22 percent.) There also were some Eurasian sympathies displayed in the answers to the question, about what could be a strategic alternative to European Union membership. The top answer was "strategic cooperation with Russia," at 28 percent, also steadily growing since 2013. In third place (behind the Organization of the Islamic Conference) was the Shanghai Cooperation Organization, and in fourth was that Turkey "should establish a Turkic Union." #160; No other Eurasian country besides Azerbaijan figured prominently in the friend ratings, but several do appear in the "Which country or countries pose a threat to Turkey?" section. Russia is the fourth-most common answer, with 19 percent of Turks perceiving it as a threat, and Armenia is right behind at 18 percent. #160; So is Azerbaijan really getting that popular in Turkey? There has long been rhetoric of "one nation, two states," as the two countries speak similar languages and see one another as brotherly partners. There is large-scale economic cooperation, particularly on oil and gas, and Turks sympathize with and back Azerbaijan in its conflict with Armenia over Nagorno Karabakh. But that has existed for a long time; what's changed since 2013? A couple of Turkey's top Caucasus experts say there is some validity to Azerbaijan's recent rise, if only by process of elimination. "The main reason is most probably Turkey's worsening relations with both the EU and U.S.," said Mitat  #199;elikpala, dean of the Faculty of Economics, Administrative and Social Sciences at Kadir Has. "Russia is not a promising and trustful partner as well. Arabs are traditionally out of the list and we lost our connection with Pakistan and other Central Asians as well. Thus Azerbaijan remains as the sole  #8220;one nation two states #8221; in the list."  #199;elikpala pointed to some concrete things Azerbaijan has done, notably coming quickly to the defense of Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdo #287;an after last year's coup attempt, and Baku's [vigorous efforts](http://www.eurasianet.org/node/80061) against the organization of Fethullah G #252;len, whom Erdo #287;an blames for the coup. #160; The sharp domestic polarization in the country and resulting "conspiratorial inclinations" also contributes to Azerbaijan's rise, he added. "People do not trust each other and are taking positions against each other. Many of them believe that this hostile or poisonous environment is created by outside powers. 'Lone wolf syndrome' as a result leaves the only friendly position to Azerbaijan." Another analyst, G #246;kt #252;rk T #252;ys #252;zo #287;lu, a professor at the #160;Giresun University Department of International Relations, concurred. "The tension between Turkey's Western partners and the tremendous apprehension of mutual trust is the most important reason" for Azerbaijan's elevation, he said. #160; He also pointed to the growing paranoia in Turkish political culture. "This understanding, which can be expressed as 'a Turk has no other friend than a Turk,' naturally brought Azerbaijan to the forefront," he said [https://eurasianet.org/azerbaijan-quickly-becoming-turks-best-only-friend](https://eurasianet.org/azerbaijan-quickly-becoming-turks-best-only-friend)  #8203; *Here is researches on Armenia's choice:* [https://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2017/05/11/orthodox-christians-in-central-and-eastern-europe-favor-strong-role-for-russia-in-geopolitics-religion/](https://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2017/05/11/orthodox-christians-in-central-and-eastern-europe-favor-strong-role-for-russia-in-geopolitics-religion/) [https://www.iri.org/sites/default/files/2018.11.23\_armenia\_poll.pdf](https://www.iri.org/sites/default/files/2018.11.23_armenia_poll.pdf)  #8203; P.S. i took these links from the shared subreddit</TEXT>

    <TEXT>It is said that the servicemen involved in the capture of the head of the Armenian army's intelligence-sabotage group, senior lieutenant Gurgen Alaverdiya, in the direction of Goranboy on August 23, were expelled from the army. This information was spread by blogger Habib Muntazir, one of the founders of Meydan TV. According to his information, 1 sergeant, 4 MAXE (overtime servicemen) were expelled from the army, the rank of senior commander, platoon commander was removed, and a total of 14 servicemen were punished. "All this was done by the order of Chief of General Staff Najmaddin Sadikov. The Defense Ministry's Main Security Department inspected the military unit. The head of the department is Major General Ramil Asgarov. He is the nephew of Chief of General Staff Najmaddin Sadikov, "Habib Muntazir wrote. According to the report, the reason was that the images of the Armenian captive were taken on a smartphone and made public. The Defense Ministry's press service partially confirmed the incident to virtualaz.org. Although the ministry denied that the servicemen were punished by Najmaddin Sadikov, he acknowledged that the servicemen were punished: "This is a fabrication, a slander against the military leadership," he said. In connection with the events, we declare that some servicemen have grossly violated the requirements of the relevant order banning the use of smartphones in the Azerbaijani army. Thus, the servicemen took photos and videos of the captured Armenian spy and sent them to a close relative, as a result of which the images were spread on social networks. As a result of the preliminary investigation, the guilty servicemen were released from service and the collected materials were sent to the Military Prosecutor's Office for legal assessment. According to the Azerbaijani Defense Ministry, at 05:45 on August 23, a sabotage-intelligence group of the Armenian armed forces attempted to commit a provocation. During the battle, the commander of the Armenian sabotage group, senior lieutenant Gurgin Alberyan, was taken prisoner for preliminary interrogation. The Armenian Defense Ministry denied the information provided by the Azerbaijani side. Ministry spokesman Shushan Stepanyan said that on August 22, at about 19:30, officer Gurgen Alaverdiyan (introduced by the Azerbaijani Interior Ministry as Gurgin Alberyan) went missing due to bad weather.</TEXT>

    <TEXT> gt;this sentence always blow my mind, how nation can be good and twenty years do not nothing to change a country if they are not agree with politics? First of all, people are just people, does not matter if they are ukrainians, azerbaijanis, americans, russians and etc. Most of the people do not even aware of their countries' foreign policy, specially if the country is the biggest country in the world or they are just simply brainwashed. And also, most of the people are apolitics who just minds their own business and try to live their life peacefully. Secondly, taking down dictators is not an easy work. My country has been ruled by dictator almost 20 years now and it still continues. 90 percentage of the people do not like our current goverment, but again, as i say, it is not an easy thing to taking down a dictator. The same goes to Russia, i believe most of the people do not like their current goverment, i mean just look at [their reaction in this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BiI5UuCiEoU), but still even if there are people who do like their current goverment, most of those people are probably brainwashed by goverment (Putin) propaganda</TEXT>

Although the Court of Inquiry was meant to take place behind closed doors, as accordance with standard military procedures, the proceeding was held in public instead.

Contrary to official British colonial authorities, the mutiny was not an isolated case of a purely local affair but was instead part of a wider anti-British and pro-Muslim battle. When Turkey decided to join in the war on the side of the Central Powers (Germany, Austria-Hungary and Italy), the Ottoman Sultan, Mehmed V.

    <TEXT>"Turkey is carrying terrorists from Syria to Azerbaijan," said Lindsey Snell, one of the sources quoted by the perpetrators as "foreign media." (I wrote about the main source in the previous status, [in this one](https://www.reddit.com/r/azerbaijan/comments/j04h7f/9_screenshot_photos_that_gives_information_about/)) Lindsey Snell, an American "journalist", Pkk-Pyd lover, is an enemy of Turkey. She says she is a Muslim and the photos she shared on social media show her wearing a hijab. On Twitter, she introduced herself as a freelance journalist covering video content and she said she had written interviews for organizations such as MSNBC, VICE, ABC News, Discovery, Amnesty International, Vocativ, Yahoo News, IRIN (Iran), and The New Arab. Ms Snell said in on of her most recent Facebook posts, on 5 August that she was held in a cave prison by militants even though she was given permission to film in their territory in Syria. Snell later wrote on Twitter that she was rescued by a brave man on a motorcycle. Lindsey Snell was arrested in Hatay on August 7, 2016, after crossing from Syria to Turkey for "unauthorized entry into the military zone." Police raided Snell's home in Istanbul on August 22 and confiscated his electronic devices, including his computer and camera. Snell was later released. She conducts YPG / PKK propaganda. Many people in the United States work for the YPG / PKK terrorist organization under the guise of journalism. One of them, Lindsey Snell, went to Syria and signed the anti-Turkish news with the images she shared from the YPG camps. Lindsey Snell, who also promotes terrorism on social media, swore at the Turkish flag on the other side of the border (Turkey-Syria). At the time, Lindsey Snell had a piece of YPG / PKK flag behind her.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>The reason why we (at least i am) share rumors about Armenia and Pkk militants is because Armenian side started shared rumors about Azerbaijan and Syrian mercenaries. Armenian side was indeed the first one who started shared uncorfirmed sources about these mercenaries. Armenian side uses unverified sources from pro-Assad, pro-Pkk (*terrorist organization*) news sites, so we (at least me) started to use unverified sources from pro-Turkey news sites. Do not get me wrong, if i did have info about this pro-Syria and pro-Pkk *(terrorist organization*) news sites and journalists, i would definitely shared it in here and after that i would stop sharing rumours about Armenia and Pkk. And also, what i observe is that while on reddit most of Azeris do not believe these kind of crap news about armenians, while good amount of armenians in reddit are quick to judge us. That is the one thing that pisses me off. ***The hipocrasy, some of the armenians telling us not to believe pkk and armenia news while they believe the same kind of crap news because it is anti-azeri.*** (see the comments: [in this post](https://www.reddit.com/r/azerbaijan/comments/j03skp/turkishbacked_mercenaries_turkey_sends_over_300/))  #8203;  gt; aren #8217;t even flagged as *unreliable* by the mods (something that is indeed done on [r/armenia](https://www.reddit.com/r/armenia/) with posts claiming Syrian mercenaries are going to Azerbaijan). The last unverified source which is shared in r/armenia is [this one](https://www.reddit.com/r/azerbaijan/comments/j03skp/turkishbacked_mercenaries_turkey_sends_over_300/), in which i asked the admin of subreddit to put "unverified" flair on it and admin did that (thanks to him). You can do the same, you can ask to admins of this subreddit to put flair on those unverified sources. In fact i will help you, for example [this one](https://www.reddit.com/r/azerbaijan/comments/j04682/media_armenias_activeness_in_middle_east/) is shared by me after i saw that armenian side started shared [this news](https://www.reddit.com/r/armenia/comments/j03o89/turkishbacked_mercenaries_turkey_sends_over_300/).

They are ***unverified, uncomfirmed***. And i think none of us should believe it until they got proven.  #8203;  gt;\-Azerbaijan using Islamic mercenaries in the 90s Yeah, just like how ASALA terrorists did play a part in Karabagh war  gt;\-Azerbaijan using Islamic mercenaries in the 90s, despite vastly outnumbering Armenia The situation in Azerbaijan today and 30 years ago was totally different, you can not compare these situations. Sure, we have a dictatorship in country today but 30 years ago our country was in the internal chaos, civil war in the middle of the war. It was so chaotic that on of the colonels who leads one of the main batallion in Karabag, took his army and tanks, left the war to go back to Baku, *with tanks (see:* [Surat\_Huseynov](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surat_Huseynov)). According to my relatives who lived in 90s, they said that for a time they and most of the people did not even know that there was a war going on but it is just what my relatives said, it did not come from some kind of news sites  #8203;  gt;\-Turkey is known for sending mercenaries to its allies (Syria and Libya). Totally different countries, totally different situations. Both countries (Syria and Libya) is in an internal civil war, Azerbaijan is not in a civil war right now. But again as i say, news about Syrian mercenaries and Azerbaijan is neither false nor true, they are unverified and uncomfirmed just like news about PKK militants and Armenia  #8203;  gt;By the way isn #8217;t Idlib post pro-Turkey as well? Based on tweets they put, i do not think so, they are not pro-Syria too.  #8203;  gt;The same can #8217;t be said about PKK soldiers suddenly deciding to fight for Armenia PKK have relations with ASALA terrorist organization. The same terrorist organization that whose members fought in Karabagh, the same terrorist organization that whose member's funeral happened in Armenia with ex-president Ter-Petrosyan's attendance in 1993 if i remember correctly. In fact, one of the members of Asala terroist organization did get a requiem service at the Yerablur Pantheon in Yerevan according to this [armenian source](https://m.armeniasputnik.am/world/20200911/24423921/libananum-mahacele-asalai-martikneric-abraham-tovmasyany.html) which the source proudly writes about it. (Edit: happened couple of days ago according to the source) And also according to wikileaks sources wounded PKK fighters from neighboring countries receive medical treatment in Armenia. For example, ***this is written in WIKILEAKS source:*** *The mayors of two Yezidi Kurdish villages, spoke openly to us during a May 31 visit about the fact of PKK (KGK) presence in Armenia,* ***telling us that wounded PKK fighters from neighboring countries receive medical treatment in Armenia.*** *We also discussed the complicated issue of Yezidi Kurdish nationality in Armenia, and emerged with a clearer picture of the community's self-identity: an unassimilated group that exists peacefully as a subset of Armenia's citizenry, but that also maintains strong ties with the broader Kurdish nation, and sympathizes with the PKK. There seems a clear rural/urban divide, with rural dwellers embracing a Kurdish national identity, and pro-PKK sympathy, that their Yerevan-based brethren disdain.* *Mayor Broyan was late for our meeting, so we talked to his sons before he arrived. Rustap, one of the mayor's sons, told us that the PKK had "united all Kurds throughout the world," and* ***that the organization was present in Armenia. He said the organization counted some Armenians among its members (presumably Yezidi Kurds and not ethnic Armenians, but he did not elaborate).*** *Rustap told us that there were probably about a dozen Armenian Yezidi Kurds currently fighting with the PKK, among them a 27-year-old man from Ria Taza.* *Rustap's brother, Ishkhan, confirmed reports we had heard previously (refs B, C and D) that the PKK's Yerevan organization, the Kurdistan Committee, organizes protests against Turkey or in favor of Ocalan. Ishkhan vehemently denied earlier reports that the Kurdistan Committee pays villagers to participate in the protests.* **WOUNDED PKK FIGHTERS TREATED IN ARMENIA** **In his living room, sparsely decorated but for an Abdullah Ocalan calendar and a small Ocalan poster, Mayor Broyan told us that the question of whether the PKK was in Armenia was neither Armenia's business, nor the United States' business. When pressed, he confirmed that the PKK was in Armenia, and boasted that wounded PKK fighters received medical treatment in Armenia (something we have heard before -- ref B). When asked how many, he requested that Poloff stop taking notes.** **Given the choice of dozens or hundreds, Broyan told us that hundreds of fighters from Turkey, Syria, Iran and Iraq came to Armenia for treatment. He said that those who were severely wounded received initial treatment here, before being sent to Europe. We were unable to get details on how fighters entered and exited the country, or even on where exactly they were treated. Broyan told us he could take us to see some of them, but that he would have to ask permission first. When we asked who would need to give him permission, he said there was a "center" in Armenia that coordinated the treatment. We asked what the Armenian government thought about this, and he said, "We do it through our own community; we don't tell the government."** **Alagyaz Mayor Mghoyan was more careful in his discussion of the PKK. While he spoke openly about the fact that there was a PKK office in his village, and even volunteered to take us there, he told us that the office's purpose was to put on concerts and hold cultural events. We took him up on his offer to show us the office, however, when we arrived there, we were told that the PKK representatives had just left for Yerevan and would be gone for the rest of the day.** **Mayor Broyan's estimation that "hundreds" of PKK fighters receive treatment in Armenia is almost certainly an exaggeration; we were unable to convince him to be more specific about the number, or about whether it referred to those being treated currently as opposed to all those who have ever been treated here. Though Broyan took pains to describe the fighters as "wounded," we believe that it would be difficult to conceal from Armenian authorities significant numbers of battle-wounded Kurds receiving treatment in public hospitals. However, PKK fighters seeking non-combat-related general medical care might more easily slip below authorities' radar. It is most likely that our interlocutors, as clear PKK sympathizers, may well wish us to believe that the organization is more robust, and better organized and funded, than is actually the case.** Wikileaks source: [https://wikileaks.org/plusd/cables/07YEREVAN723\_a.html](https://wikileaks.org/plusd/cables/07YEREVAN723_a.html)  #8203; Edit:  gt;Also, Armenians aren #8217;t the ones who started spreading these rumors, they were started by Kurdish news outlets. Yes, kurdish and pro-Assad news outlets published it and armenian side started spreading it, in reddit at least</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Nowhere in the comment i say it is related to the Armenian goverment, please read carefully again. The user i talked, says that Azerbaijan used Islamic mercenaries in 90s and i also mentioned that Asala terrorists also take part in Karabagh war, and ASala have relations with Pkk, and also pkk fighters got medical treatments in Armenia according to wikileaks source, again where did i say that it is related to the Armenian goverment?  #8203;  gt;What is also Is also interesting is that you say you are promoting all this low level propaganda in response to there other propagada... how is that a justification? You are knowingly promoting propaganda. Yes. Because it looked like to me, this started become information war against Azeris in reddit. If the opposition site started spreading rumours against us and do not want to stop it, i will do the same by spreading rumours, simple as that. Now as i said in previous comments, if i did find out these informations about these news sites who shares rumours before, i would definitely put them as soon as possible, while stopping spreading rumours just like how armenian side started to spread rumours and some of those "peaceful" ones coming here with their judgmental comments. (edit: and downvoting this one, lol) P.S. if you want my opinion about the Syrian mercenaries, personally, i do not want war but *if the war becomes inevitable* i would choose Syrian mercenaries die in war rather than our Azeri soldiers. And i would not judge armenians who would choose pkk militants to die in a war rather than armenian soldiers, *if the war become inevitable*. But i hope the situation would not come to that point Edit 1: about the P.S. i would not judge Azerbaijan using Syrian jihadists in a war, if Armenia started to use pkk or Asala members in a war first and the same applies to the Armenia if the Azerbaijani side started to use Syrian jihadists in a war first, *if the war becomes inevitable* Edit 2: in edit1 and P.S. section i talked about using terrorists, not mercenaries, because for my understanding being a mercenary and being a terrorist is a different thing</TEXT>

    <TEXT> gt;you #8217;re kind of shooting yourself in the foot here by implying that Armenian terrorists fighting for Armenia is as likely as Syrian mercenaries fighting for Azerbaijan (obviously it #8217;s not) Terrorists none or less  gt;Also don #8217;t you think it #8217;s kind of suspicious how these reports of PKK soldiers surfaced like a week after claims that Azerbaijan was recruiting Syrian mercenaries? Because this is an information war. (Edit: "propaganda war" would be a better term actually) In my eyes it is called propaganda war if both sides started spreading rumours (by not calling them rumours and presenting them as facts which is what these egyptian and syrian news sites are doing). Pro-pkk and pro-Assad kurdish and syrian news sites started spreading rumours about Turkey, while Pro-Turkey egyptian news sites started to do exact same thing against kurds. To be honest, i dont really think that these news sites gave too much shit about Azerbaijan and Armenia and Karabagh war. I think their quarrel mainly with each others reputation, while they try drag us into their war. But again as i say, these news could be true or false but they are surely *unverified and uncomfirmed*  #8203;  gt;Even if neither of them are true, isn #8217;t the one which came first more likely to be true If neither of them are true it means neither of them are true  #8203;  gt;Idlib Post is based in Syrian parts controlled by Turkey unless I #8217;m seriously mistaken. Considering that free speech and media aren #8217;t exactly a thing anymore in Turkey, I don #8217;t think their vassal would be any different (it #8217;s even worse there actually). Based on their twitter, i could not say they are pro-Turkish, because some of their news are indeed felt anti-turkish and some other tweets of them are also felt like anti-Syria, so i do not know whom they work. I do not think that pro-turkish news site would share information based on Lindsey Snell who is a major well-known turcophobe  #8203;  gt;ASALA was disbanded in 1988 while the war started in 1992. According to wikipedia, ASALA's last and most recent attack took place in Brussels in 1997, where a group of militants claiming to be ASALA bombed the Turkish Embassy in the city.[\[19\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Armenian_Secret_Army_for_the_Liberation_of_Armenia#cite_note-19)  #8203;  gt;Monte Melkonian left ASALA after realizing ASALA terrorists weren #8217;t heroic freedom fighters and having a spat with them According to [Markar Melkonian](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markar_Melkonian), the brother of the Armenian military leader [Monte Melkonian](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monte_Melkonian), "Khojaly had been a strategic goal, but it had also been an act of revenge." The date of the massacre in Khojaly had a special significance: it was the run-up to the fourth anniversary of the [anti-Armenian](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anti-Armenianism) [pogrom in the city of Sumgait](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sumgait_pogrom) where the civilian Armenian population was brutally murdered solely because of their ethnic origin.[\[3\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Khojaly_massacre#cite_note-deWaal-3) Melkonian particularly mentions the role of the fighters of two Armenian military detachments called the Arabo and Aramo, who stabbed to death many Azeri civilians, despite strict orders given by Monte Melkonian, that no captives were to be harmed.[\[40\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Khojaly_massacre#cite_note-40) The reason why i put this one because in my opinion there were also some asala terrorists (or ex-asala as you said) among the people who commited massacres in Khojaly. But that is just my assumption based on markar melkonian the brother of monte who was asala fighter, is the one who wrote this book, and again this is just my assumption, i could be wrong in my assumption  gt;The WikiLeaks source doesn #8217;t make much sense, leaving the fact that WikiLeaks doesn #8217;t report on the veracity of the documents they obtain, they just publish them, there are many other aspects that don #8217;t make sense. Every source is a debatable, the reason why i put wikileaks because they are kind of famous for publishing secret reports  #8203;  gt;The reason Azerbaijan plunged into political chaos in the 90s was mainly because of their losses during the Karabakh war (for example Mutalibov being forced out after the Khojaly massacre) The reason of civil war in Azerbaijan is that, Elchibey suddenly decided to remove all of the russian troops from Azerbaijan. During Mutallibov time Azerbaijan started losing, but during Elchibey time Azerbaijan actually started winning and if i remember correctly there is 9 or 11km left between Azerbaijani troops and Khankendi (Stepanakert). And then Elchibey suddenly removed all russian troops from Azerbaijan which caused civil war and Suret Huseynov (pro-Russia) heading from Karabagh to the Baku with his troops and tanks. Removing russian troops from Azerbaijan was the main cause of the civil war in Azerbaijan during Elchibey time (personally i do not like neither Suret nor Elchibey)</TEXT>

Full-text is: On 20 June unidentified individuals detonated a bomb at the Turkish Embassy in Brussels. An anonymous caller claimed the attack in the name of the "Gourken Yanikian Military Unite," a covername used by the Armenian Secret Army for the Liberation of Armenia (ASALA) terrorist organization during the 1980s. ASALA had not conducted terrorist attacks in several years, however, and it is unclear whether the attack was carried out by ASALA, individual Armenians with no terrorist affiliation, or another terrorist group--such as the Kurdistan Workers' Party--using Yanikian as a covername.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>No, wrong. Historically and scientifically it is wrong. It is just your pathetic, turcophobic, narrow, racist mindset with an admixture of limited history knowledge about Azerbaijanis. You do not know jackshit about us mate, yet you are so racist that you call us invaders, even though you do not know anything about us. But let me teach and try to enlight you kiddo: First of all oguz turks who migrated to caucasus and iranian plateu did not invade any place mate. Seljuk dynasty from todays Turkmenistan ***conquered*** this place and after the conquering of seljuks, huge amount of oghuz turks ***migrated*** to this land in 9th, 10th century. You know, just like how armenians migrated to these lands (i don't know when, since i do not care and have no interest on armenian history, but from what i know, there are used to live people before the armenians) and just like how every people in the world migrated to other parts of the world from Africa. It would be called invasion, if the turkic tribes who migrated to this land (during seljuk period) whould have killed all the locals when they migrated in here. For example, europeans who went to america in 16th-17th century, they were invaders. Why? Because they killed almost more than 90% of native americans. *Now, that is an invasion mate.* Thats why huuge majority of this white europeans (probably more than 90%) who lives in an america right now, they do not have any single native american genetics. Because europeans who went to america killed big majority of the native americans in there. But turks who come to Caucasus and Iranian plateu did not kill the locals in there. The locals and turks mixed up with each other. You want a proof?? Proof is me, proof is the admins of this subreddit, proof is the huge majority of Azerbaijanis who lives both in Azerbaijan and Iran. We are the natives mate and we are the turks too. We primarily descend from *Iranic* people, specifically [Medes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medes), [Atropatene](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atropatene) followed by strong/significant secondary *Anatolian*, due to [Qizilbash turks migration](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Qizilbash) from Anatolia to these lands and *Medieval Turkic* descent, and some notable *Caucasian related ancestry* as well. Here is a nice good article for you about origin of Azerbaijani turks with a facts and sources: [https://www.reddit.com/r/azerbaijan/comments/iw7xda/the\_genetic\_origin\_of\_azerbaijani\_turks/](https://www.reddit.com/r/azerbaijan/comments/iw7xda/the_genetic_origin_of_azerbaijani_turks/) Have a nice day!!!</TEXT>

    <TEXT>i am an agnostic-atheist tho and kind of an islamophobic but trying to battle with that islamaphobia inside me since it is kind of racism. But to be honest i kind of despise islam, but since in todays world islamaphobia can be seen as an racism towards *all* the muslims, so yeah, i think i am not an islamophobic. But i think racism towards all muslims should be called a muslimophobia not islamophobia and the term "islamophobia" should mean as hate towards islam (religion) not all of the followers of a religion. I do indeed despise islam but i have no problem with normal muslims who do not care about my religious identity.</TEXT>

Look, as much as i do not like the situation myself, but sadly this is the political situation now. I hope you guys would understand that it is not a personal thing towards Kosovo, it is just a political situation Edit: also from what i know serbia is an ally of Russia, so it would also damage our relationships with Russia and probably its allies</TEXT>

    <TEXT> gt;Serbia hates Muslims and supports Armenia, you know that right? Yes i know, even though on official level they say that they are neutral but their companies sells wapons to Armenia that caused a death of the Azerbaijani civilian by a Serbian weapon back in July  #8203;  gt;They cannot do that because they oppose Kosovo. They didnt recognize (officially) Russian annexation of crimea either. But again, we can not take that risk. I will explain in below.  #8203;  gt;It's very personal to us. Kosovo experienced genocide and ethnic cleansing from serbia. Another state recognising our plight is just another argument against serbia. And our situation is very personal to us. Azerbaijanis, same as you guys, experienced massacres and ethnic cleansing from armenia and Karabagh. So, thats why we can not let any single (fully-recognized) country regocnize Nagorno-Karabagh as an independent country because it would be direct injustice towards us and thats why we are trying to act according to that. Try to look at the situation from our side.  #8203;  gt;Anyway, I just wanted to ask. Geopolitics is complicates but I thank you nonetheless for the straightforward answers. No problem, peace to you too my friend.</TEXT>

    <TEXT> gt;Doing something as disgusting as celebrating axe murderers who kill people in their sleep is specific to Azerbaijan. u/itSmellsLikeSnotHere, Praising a murderer is not just a specific to Azerbaijan. For example, there is a guy named [Varoujan\_Garabedian](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Varoujan_Garabedian), a well known armenian [ASALA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Armenian_Secret_Army_for_the_Liberation_of_Armenia) terrorist who was known for being the accused bomber of the [1983 fatal bombing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1983_Orly_Airport_attack) at Orly Airport in Paris, the attack that killed eight people.  #8203; Here is more info about this guy: In the late 1990s, a petition was signed by over one million people in Armenia,[\[9\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Varoujan_Garabedian#cite_note-9) and was appealed by members of the Armenian government and civic leaders including former and current [Presidents of Armenia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Presidents_of_Armenia).[\[10\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Varoujan_Garabedian#cite_note-sign-10) The appeal was sent to the French authorities to pardon Varoujan Garabedian and Armenia offered asylum to Garabedian upon his release from prison.[\[10\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Varoujan_Garabedian#cite_note-sign-10) After spending 17 years in jail, he was pardoned by the [Bourges](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bourges) [court of appeals](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Court_of_appeals) on April 23, 2001 on the condition that he be deported to [Armenia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Armenia).[\[1\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Varoujan_Garabedian#cite_note-rferl-1)[\[2\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Varoujan_Garabedian#cite_note-Agence_France_Presse_2001-2)[\[11\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Varoujan_Garabedian#cite_note-11) The mayor of [Yerevan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yerevan), [Robert Nazaryan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_Nazaryan), had pledged to provide him with employment and accommodation, and in Garabedian had a meeting with Prime Minister [Andranik Margaryan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andranik_Margaryan),[\[12\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Varoujan_Garabedian#cite_note-12) who expressed happiness at his release.[\[1\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Varoujan_Garabedian#cite_note-rferl-1) While in prison, he started to paint and produced many paintings.[\[13\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Varoujan_Garabedian#cite_note-13) Many prominent Armenian intellectuals, including [Zori Balayan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zori_Balayan), [Silva Kaputikyan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Silva_Kaputikyan), [Sos Sargsyan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sos_Sargsyan), [Gevorg Emin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gevorg_Emin), [Perch Zeytuntsyan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perch_Zeytuntsyan), [Levon Ananyan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Levon_Ananyan) and others expressed support of Garabedian.[\[14\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Varoujan_Garabedian#cite_note-14) According to Armenian media, Garabedian was unofficially "supervising" the Yerevan-Dilijan transport line and with his guards was a part of a criminal incident in 2010.[\[15\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Varoujan_Garabedian#cite_note-15) Garabedian died on 29 January 2019 in [Yerevan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yerevan) from a suspected [heart attack](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heart_attack) at the age of 64.[\[16\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Varoujan_Garabedian#cite_note-16)</TEXT>

    <TEXT>From what i know they are mercenaries. So, what is wrong with buying mercenaries? Even if they are jihadists (which some people claim), then to be honest it is better them dying than our soldiers. I mean, it is literally a fucking war. So, they either gonna kill soldiers of the country who invaded my country and displaced more than 300k-400k people in Karabagh and fights for preventing these people coming home or they are gonna get killed. Two birds, one stone. I see this as an absolute win.</TEXT>

    <TEXT> gt;However, Armenians were the majority in NKAO long before the war started (and long before any large-scale ethnic expulsion). They even held a referendum, in which they overwhelmingly voted for independence. If armenians do not want to live under Azerbaijani rule then why would Azerbaijanis of Nagorno-Karabagh should live under Armenian rule? Also i am just gonna put [this photo](https://www.reddit.com/r/azerbaijan/comments/j3bhb0/when_armenians_raised_the_issue_of_the_annexation/) in here Also who gave Armenians right ***invade*** and ***occupied*** seven adjacent territories and expelled more than 600 thousand people from Nagorno-Karabagh and ocuupied territories?  #8203;  gt;is incomplete information without mentioning that 300,000 #8211;500,000 of Armenians were expelled from Azerbaijan (according to Wiki). We are talking about ***only people of Karabag*** not Armenia or Azerbaijan. If we are gonna go with your way then i am also adding 250,000 Azeri refugees from Armenia (one being my paternal side).</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Such a waste of time to write bunch of bullshit things. Azerbaijanis have been much worse situation than this one ***under Soviet rule.*** [the deportation of approximately 100,000 Azerbaijanis from Armenian SSR and replacement of Armenians in their houses on December 23, 1947](https://www.reddit.com/r/azerbaijan/comments/j265l6/signed_decree_of_stalin_about_ordering_the/) could be one of the examples According to [Chronology of the conflict](http://news.bbc.co.uk/hi/russian/news/newsid_3681000/3681079.stm), *The first thing of the conflict* is, in August 1987, Karabakh Armenians sent a petition for union with Armenia with tens of thousands of signatures to Moscow. So again, If armenians did not start pathetic ethno-nationalism at the beginning of the conflict and try to sat down with Azerbaijan, there would be no war today  #8203;  gt;I also don't deny that 500,000 Azerbaijanis lost their homes, ethnic cleansing is not okay, it's a sad result of the war and failure to come to any resolution. Awww, look at you, such a nice person, you gonna make me cwyyy, lol. I do not give a fuck about you being sad, your sadness is useless. If you are so "sad" about our IDPs, go protest to Pashinyan to leave those lands that have been invaded by armenian invader army so that our 500-600 thousand people could return their homes. *"the number of internally displaced persons from occupied Nagorno Karabakh and the seven adjacent districts was more than 600,000."* [These people need to return their homes](https://www.unhcr.org/protection/convention/4bd7edbd9/azerbaijan-analysis-gaps-protection-internally-displaced-persons-idps.html). ***And we will not stop demanding that until these people return to their homes.*** It has been 30 years already for fuck sake  #8203;  gt;Why is it so hard to let the Armenians of Karabakh choose their fate? Because armenians self-determinated themselves. They have their own state and it is called "Armenia".  #8203;  gt;Maybe because Azerbaijan wants the area without Armenians? Again i say, Azerbaijan is willing to give armenians of Karabagh the highest possibly autonomy  #8203;  gt;The truth hurts. Yes exactly and you know what the truth is? The truth is: *United Nations General Assembly Resolution 62/243* reaffirmed "continued respect and support for the sovereignty and territorial integrity" of Azerbaijan "within its internationally recognized borders", demanded the\* ***"immediate, complete and unconditional withdrawal of all*** ***Armenian*** ***forces from all the occupied territories of Azerbaijan"****, and emphasized that "no state shall render aid or assistance" to maintain the occupation of Azerbaijani territories.*[\[1\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Nations_General_Assembly_Resolution_62/243#cite_note-1) [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United\_Nations\_General\_Assembly\_Resolution\_62/243](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Nations_General_Assembly_Resolution_62/243)</TEXT>

    <TEXT> gt;It seems like you just want to ignore the fact that Armenians aren't safe in Azerbaijan. Safety of armenians can be achieved in under the highest possible autonomy. Also, after the highest possible autonomy, even peacekeeper armies of the third party can be used for safety of armenians if they accept the internationally recognized border. **And also it seems like you just want to ignore the fact that** *"the number of internally displaced Azerbaijanis from occupied Nagorno Karabakh and the seven adjacent districts was more than 600,000."*  #8203;  gt;One thing I know with no uncertainty is that we're dealing with a dictatorship regime that has been planning military action on the region for a long time. Military action started because **armenia rejected the Madrid principle and** **armenia's defense minister said "new ages, new territories" (**[Armenia #8217;s defense minister threatened to take more of Azerbaijan #8217;s territory, and Azerbaijan reacted in kind.](https://eurasianet.org/after-peace-negotiations-threats-of-war-break-out-between-armenia-and-azerbaijan))  #8203; And About Armenians rejection of the Madrid principle: \-- gt; In August 2016, the Armenian National Committee of America (ANCA) #8212;the U.S. Armenian lobby organization #8212;launched a campaign against the Madrid Principles, claiming the Madrid Principles based on the Helsinki Final Act were "reckless" and "undemocratic" and calling for Obama Administration to reject them.\[2\]\[3\] In March 2020, the Republic of Armenia rejected the Madrid Principles.

    <TEXT> gt;Thanks for replying and talking to me No problem  #8203;  gt;even if you hate my guts. I do not hate your guts, i hate your hipocrasy and you showed it in your first comment  #8203;  gt;It's still clear to me that Azerbaijan intentionally escalated military action to take the region back by force, but I know you'll disagree with that. Yes, I am. You know why? Because there is simply not an evidence to show that, we can not know for sure. Yet, ***even if that is true (not saying it is true)***, Azerbaijan would not have done it, if Pashinyan and his adminstration would not got bold. The main thing he did was rejecting Madrid Principle, ***it was accepted by both sides as a peace solution but he rejected it***, Then, after rejecting *peace solution* he told "Karabakh is Armenia, period" in the majority of Azeri city in Iran. That is a disrespectful and a person who wants peace would not tell that to a country who has more than 600000 internally displace people from Karabagh itself. And one of the main and last stroke was defence minister of Armenia threatening to take more of our territory which would be resulted to our people forcefully displaced again. And there are other things like deployin lebanese or other arabic armenians to an occupied regions like Jabrayil which our people are forced to leave, making a road from Armenia to Jabrayil, a city that is not in a NK, but Jabrayil is libarated now (which would let more than 60000-65000 of our people coming to their homes in Jabrayil). If you want my honest opinion, i liked him in the beginning, when he elected and to be honest his internal politics is good, i gave him that one but his foreign politics completely sucks, which was the one of the main reason of the war. I thing from the last year, he kind of got cocky  #8203;  gt;though if Turkey is involved I would argue one side is escalating for a reason. Turkey sold us 3-4 TB2 drones (2shots in one drone) for 200million dollars if i remember correctly. Also, having Turkey on our side is very important for us because our northern neighbor is Russia who has eyes on our oil, who wants to make us their vassal, our Eastern neighbor is Armenia who occupied our territory and who had a conflict with us and our Southern neighbor is Iran Islamic republic who actively tries to make us less secular and make us more religious with her propaganda in social media, so that mollahs can control us. Fortunately they can't achieve it since we are very secular but still they are trying.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Hello, u/rafapova. Firstly, i would like to thank you for asking to other side (to us) about this really complex conflict instead of judging us just like how users of r/europe does it. When you write "christian armenian" i feel like you think that it is a "muslim/christian" fight. First of all, this is not a "christian vs muslim" fight. Sure Azerbaijan is a muslim majority country but also Azerbaijan is the most secular country in a muslim world.

When the republics of Armenia, Georgia and Azerbaijan were esthablished after the break-up of Transcaucasia. The map of Azerbaijan republic is this: [https://www.reddit.com/r/azerbaijan/comments/j61l1q/map\_of\_azerbaijan\_accepted\_by\_france\_in\_1918\_what/](https://www.reddit.com/r/azerbaijan/comments/j61l1q/map_of_azerbaijan_accepted_by_france_in_1918_what/) As you can see, Karabagh was already part of Azerbaijan before the Sovet Union, alongside with Nakhcievan and Zangazur region (Zangazur region is now part of ~~Azerbaijan~~ Armenia). But, make no mistake, we do not lay a claim to the area between Nakchievan and Karabagh region. Because officially it is the land that belongs to Armenia and ***unlike some countries we respect internationally recognized borders*** So, did Stalin really "gift" us the Karabagh? Answer is now. Explanation: **Did Stalin really give Karabakh to Azerbaijan?** A page from the 1921 Kovburo Protocol about Karabakh announces the creation of Nagorno Karabakh Autonomous Republic with its capital in Shusha and also states that Karabakh " #1086; #1089; #1090; #1072; #1085; #1086; #1074; #1080; #1090;" (in translation, ***"remains"***) part of Azerbaijan. Here is the original document of Stalin, -- gt; [https://www.reddit.com/user/canavaaar/comments/ib41w8/a\_meeting\_of\_the\_caucasian\_bureau\_with\_the/](https://www.reddit.com/user/canavaaar/comments/ib41w8/a_meeting_of_the_caucasian_bureau_with_the/)  #8203; If anything, Stalin did not trust the Azerbaijanis as tensions between Turkey and the Soviet Union were heated because Turkey refused the Soviet request for joint control of the Black Sea straits (1937). The situation got worse in 1945 when the USSR laid claims on the Turkish territories of Kars and Ardahan. In the Soviet government's judgement,  #8220;disloyal #8221;\[1\] Azerbaijanis could be  #8220;the fifth column #8221; (local people in favour of the enemy) in case of conflict with Turkey and for this reason Stalin allowed Azerbaijani population's deportation from Armenian SSR in 1947 #8211;1950, according to the Soviet Union's Council of Ministers #8217; Resolution #4083 from December 23, 1947.\[2\] One clauses of the resolution stated: To allow the Council of Ministers of Armenian SSR to use the buildings and houses, which were vacated by Azerbaijani population in connection with their resettlement to Kura-Aras Lowland of Azerbaijan SSR for settlement of foreign Armenians coming to Armenian SSR.\[2\] Numerous reports were received of Azeris stating their unwillingness to leave the Armenian SSR. The Armenian SSR Interior Ministry reported in 1948 that some Azerbaijanis would even visit cemeteries and pray to the souls of their ancestors "to help them stay in their lands". On the other hand, some groups decided it was better to leave as, in the case of a war with Turkey, they were convinced they would be massacred by Armenians. According to Thomas de Waal, the Azeris of Armenia once again fell victims to the Armenian #8211;Turkish question. As a result of deportation, more than 100,000 Azerbaijanis were forcibly resettled to Kura-Aras Lowland of the Azerbaijan SSR in three stages: 10,000 people in 1948, 40,000 in 1949, and 50,000 in 1950.\[3\] -- gt; [Here is the original document of deportation of 100000 Azerbaijanis from Armenia SRR](https://www.reddit.com/r/azerbaijan/comments/j265l6/signed_decree_of_stalin_about_ordering_the/) Sources: \[1\] - Vladislav M.

For example: Between 1826 and 1828 a second war raged between Russia and Persia for su- premacy in the southern Caucasus, and was ended with the peace treaty of Turk- manchay in 1828. The Erivan and Nakhchivan khanates, which up to that point had been home to a majority Azerbaijani population,57 also fell to Russia.58 Russia attempted to consolidate its control in the whole of the Caucasus region by means of a strong policy of Christianization and settlement of Armenians. The resettlement and concentration of Christian Armenians was intended to serve as a bridgehead of Russian power at the edge of the Middle East.59 Up to that point the Russian military administration had lacked the support of the Muslim population, and the proportion of Armenians in the population was relatively low.60 Corre- spondingly, the 1828 Turkmanchay peace treaty provided for a resettlement of Armenians from Persia and the Ottoman Empire to the Caucasus and in particular into the modern territories of Armenia, Azerbaijan and Georgia. As a result, massive population movements took place across the whole of the Caucasus region, with a strong influx of Armenians into Nagorno-Karabakh and other regions. An estimated 57,000 61 to 200,000 62 Armenians left territories gov- erned by Persia and the Ottomans and migrated primarily to Erivan and Nagorno- Karabakh. 30,000 Armenians settled in Karabakh alone, increasing their share of the population from 8.4% to an estimated 34.8%.63 Other studies cite a figure of almost 50%.64 In Erivan the proportion seemed to have increased from 24% to 53.8%.65 In return 35,000 of the 117,000 Muslims who once lived in Erivan and Karabakh fled Russian rule.66 Source: The Nagorno-Karabakh Conflict: A Legal Analysis by Heiko Kr #252;ger(edited)***\[21:37\]*** He also provided his sources which for this paragraph were: 57) See Rau, Der Berg-Karabach-Konflikt, 2007, pp. 23, 25. 58) See also Rau, Der Berg-Karabach-Konflikt, 2007, p. 23. 59) See Swietochowski, in: Halbach/ Kappeler (eds.), Krisenherd Kaukasus, 1995, p. 161. 60) Cf.

There is no clear proof of who shots first but to be honest i personally would not mind if Azerbaijan shot first, but that is just my personal opinion 3. No, there is no Turkish army in Azerbaijan. The claim that Turkish F-16 shot down Armenian Su-25 is total bullshit. There is no single proof about it. The only "proof" that Armenia provided is a fucking flightradar24 map (lol) and [this one](https://www.reddit.com/r/azerbaijan/comments/j3vb95/other_than_flighradar24_map_another_two_photos/) 4. Azerbaijan is willing to give the highest possible authonomy to the NK region and if Armenia accepts NK as part of Azerbaijan, we could even bring the peacekeeper soldiers of 3rd party for their safety (their main complain is their safety) 5. If it happens without our permission then invasion, disrespecting internationally recognized borders, breaking all kind of UN laws and etc. If every country respects other countries territories, there would be less wars in the world  #8203; P.S. reminder to you that Armenia occupies seven adjacent regions around Nagorno-Karabagh and there are more than 600000 IDPs in Azerbaijan. *"the number of internally displaced persons from occupied Nagorno Karabakh and the seven adjacent districts was more than 600,000.

    <TEXT>Hello, u/Weilian-Huangdi. Here is simple explanation. Azerbaijanis are genetically mainly Iranic+Turkic people (+Anatolian which is a result of Kizilbash turks return to Caucasus and Iranian Azerbaijan during Safavids). History of Azeris starts with [Atropatene](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atropatene) and [Medes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medes), but after the huge amount of turkic people came to region from today's Turkmenistan during [Seljuk\_Empire](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seljuk_Empire), turkicisization of the region started with the intermarriges between the Turkic people and Iranic people and Iranified caucasian people. Also one misconception about turkic people is that, "old turks are fully mongoloid" which is false. The turks who came to that region also have very good amount of Iranic genetics alongside with Central asian(+Siberian), since the Oghuz turks before migration to this lands lived near the Iranic people. After the Seljucks, for almost 900 years Azeris have been the ruler dynasties, soldiers and Shahs of Iran. [Eldiguzids](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eldiguzids) and [Kara\_Koyunlu](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kara_Koyunlu) (in Azerbaijani, it means "Black sheepers") are the first ones. After Karakoyunlu [Safavid\_dynasty](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Safavid_dynasty) came to power in Azerbaijan and Iran. The shah of Safavids, Shah Ismail Khata'i was born in my motherland Erdebil where my grandparents (from my maternal side) were born. After victories over [Shirvan](https://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/%D0%93%D0%BE%D1%81%D1%83%D0%B4%D0%B0%D1%80%D1%81%D1%82%D0%B2%D0%BE_%D0%A8%D0%B8%D1%80%D0%B2%D0%B0%D0%BD%D1%88%D0%B0%D1%85%D0%BE%D0%B2) and the state of [Ak Koyunlu](https://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/%D0%90%D0%BA_%D0%9A%D0%BE%D1%8E%D0%BD%D0%BB%D1%83) in 1501 he captured Tabriz and took the [title of ](https://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/%D0%A2%D0%B8%D1%82%D1%83%D0%BB)[shah of ](https://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/%D0%A8%D0%B0%D1%85)[Azerbaijan](https://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/%D0%90%D0%B7%D0%B5%D1%80%D0%B1%D0%B0%D0%B9%D0%B4%D0%B6%D0%B0%D0%BD_(%D0%BE%D0%B1%D0%BB%D0%B0%D1%81%D1%82%D1%8C)) , in 1502 - the title of shah of all Iran [\[7\]](https://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/%D0%98%D1%81%D0%BC%D0%B0%D0%B8%D0%BB_I#cite_note-8). What makes Safavids different than others is that Safavids make the Azerbaijani language official and court language in Iran. Also remind you that our language is a turkic language and very close to Turkish ([Here is nice article about Shah Ismail and Azerbaijani turkish language](http://jhss-khazar.org/wp-content/uploads/2012/06/03zakir-mlmSON-YENI-VARIANT-IRAN.pdf)). During the Gajar time (another Azeri dynasty of Iran), many [Khanates](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Khanates_of_the_Caucasus) started declared Independences from Gajars, which result fight between Gajars, Russians and Khanates. And it resulted annexation of Caucasus are to Russia in 1813 and 1828. After Russian empire collapses Transcaucasus republic is created with Armenians, Georgians and Azerbaijanis but it did not last long. After Transcaucasus republic, The republic of Georgia, the republic of Armenia and the republic of Azerbaijan (which is the first secular republic in the muslim world) is created. ([Map of Azerbaijan in 1918](https://www.reddit.com/r/azerbaijan/comments/j61l1q/map_of_azerbaijan_accepted_by_france_in_1918_what/)). But these republic came under control of communist during the 1920 and 1921. And in 1990-1991, republic of Azerbaijan declared its independence from Soviets. And here we are Here is also nice explanation about Azerbaijanis with there genetic origins: [https://www.reddit.com/r/azerbaijan/comments/iw7xda/the\_genetic\_origin\_of\_azerbaijani\_turks/](https://www.reddit.com/r/azerbaijan/comments/iw7xda/the_genetic_origin_of_azerbaijani_turks/) Also i forgot to tell you that there are more Azeris lives in Iran than republic of Azerbaijan itself. They even made huge protests in Iran about Karabagh two or three days ago: [Protests in Tabriz](https://www.reddit.com/r/azerbaijan/comments/j39j9s/protests_in_tabriz_qaraba%C4%9F_bizimdir_bizim_olacaq/) [Protests in Urmia](https://www.reddit.com/r/azerbaijan/comments/j3cs7o/urmia_second_largest_city_in_south_azerbaijan/) [Protests in Zanjan](https://www.reddit.com/r/azerbaijan/comments/j3d1k2/zangan_the_third_largest_city_in_south_azerbaijan/)</TEXT>

On 10 August 1920, Armenia signed a preliminary agreement with the Bolsheviks, agreeing to a temporary Bolshevik occupation of these areas until final settlement would be reached.\[57\] #160;In 1921, Armenia and Georgia were also taken over by the #160;Bolsheviks #160;who, in order to attract public support, promised they would ***allot*** *Karabakh to Armenia*, along with #160;Nakhchivan #160;and Zangezur (the strip of land separating Nakhchivan from Karabakh). However, the Soviet Union also had far-reaching plans concerning #160;Turkey, hoping that it would, with a little help from them, develop along #160;Communist #160;lines. Needing to placate Turkey, the Soviet Union agreed to a division under which Zangezur would fall under the control of Armenia, while Karabakh and Nakhchivan would be under the control of Azerbaijan. Had Turkey not been an issue, Stalin would likely have left Karabakh under Armenian control.\[58\] #160;As a result, the #160;Nagorno-Karabakh Autonomous Oblast #160;was established within the Azerbaijan SSR on 7 July 1923.  #8203; ***allot*** / #601; #712;l #594;t/  #65532;"Learn to pronounce" "verb" ***give or apportion (something) to someone***  #8203; "allot" Karabagh to Armenia which means ***give*** Karabagh to Armenia. ***Not remain, but give Karabagh to Armenia***  #8203; Now why they first thought to "give" to Karabag to Armenia? Not remain, but give to Karabag to Armenia? Because after the Transcaucasian republic got broken up and republics of Georgia, Azerbaijan and Armenia established.

    <TEXT>Again Stalin did not "give", Stalin said it is remained. Why Stalin said it is remained? Well i explained above and i will explain again. Because after the Transcaucasian republic got broken up and republics of Georgia, Azerbaijan and Armenia established.

    <TEXT> gt; This statement clearly implies it was originally under the Armenian SSR then later transferred to the Azerbaijan SSR.

Also, they talked armenian, also from what i know, second video was paublished by some armenian official, then got deleted suddenly. Azeri officials also says that air-defence system of Azerbaijan shot down missiles which goes towards Mingachevir and also some of those missiles did not get blown up (sorry for my bad english).

    <TEXT>i will explain why i asked that to you. Look, i opened a new account in twitter just to look news. I do not post anything, i do not tweet anything, i only use twitter for news and also retweet some news or history tweets for the "memory card" so i can use it at some point in the future. Now, after the war start i encountered many Iranian Azerbaijani twitter accounts. What i observe is that while most of them used to have some iranian nationalism alongside with azerbaijani nationalism, but after war started, i observe big switches toward Azerbaijani nationalism in these iranian azerbaijani twitter accounts. And from what i see, majority of them start having a "big fight" in twitter with persians who are very openly supports armenians and i think that pushed these iranian azerbaijanis towards Azerbaijani nationalism more than iranian nationalism. I have even remember, i encountered one interesting Iranian Azerbaijani account who used to have both Iran and Azerbaijan flag in his profile, who kind of pan-aryan and pan-turkic at same time, i know it is weird combination but it kind of seemed to me like that. But now he has only azerbaijani flag on his profile and shares tweets only about Azerbaijanis, who struck me as an hardcore Azerbaijani nationalist now. I think even if persian and iranian nationalists do not wanna admit, but their open support towards armenia pushes azerbaijanis of iran towards Azerbaijan more than ever, but that is just my observation and my opinion tho. Would like to know your opinion about it u/naravianana</TEXT>

    <TEXT> gt;Your question: When did the Armenians move the azerbaijanis out? My answer: *the number of internally displaced persons from occupied Nagorno Karabakh and the seven adjacent districts was more than 600,000. Today the Government estimates that there remain 1 million naturalized refugees and internally displaced persons in Azerbaijan,* ***the vast majority of whom were displaced during the early 1990s.*** *(the answer)* [https://www.unhcr.org/protection/convention/4bd7edbd9/azerbaijan-analysis-gaps-protection-internally-displaced-persons-idps.html](https://www.unhcr.org/protection/convention/4bd7edbd9/azerbaijan-analysis-gaps-protection-internally-displaced-persons-idps.html)  #8203; You asked, i answered with a good source (UN source)  #8203;  #8203;  gt;The region was 90% ethnic Armenian *going back to the 1800s.* Actually kind of wrong, you know. Between 1826 and 1828 a second war raged between Russia and Persia for su- premacy in the southern Caucasus, and was ended with the peace treaty of Turk- manchay in 1828. The Erivan and Nakhchivan khanates, which up to that point had been home to a majority Azerbaijani population,57 also fell to Russia.58 Russia attempted to consolidate its control in the whole of the Caucasus region by means of a strong policy of Christianization and settlement of Armenians. The resettlement and concentration of Christian Armenians was intended to serve as a bridgehead of Russian power at the edge of the Middle East.59 Up to that point the Russian military administration had lacked the support of the Muslim population, and the proportion of Armenians in the population was relatively low.60 Corre- spondingly, the 1828 Turkmanchay peace treaty provided for a resettlement of Armenians from Persia and the Ottoman Empire to the Caucasus and in particular into the modern territories of Armenia, Azerbaijan and Georgia. As a result, massive population movements took place across the whole of the Caucasus region, with a strong influx of Armenians into Nagorno-Karabakh and other regions. \*\*\***An estimated 57,000 \[61\] to 200,000 \[62\] Armenians left territories gov- erned by Persia and the Ottomans and migrated primarily to Erivan and Nagorno- Karabakh. 30,000 Armenians settled in Karabakh alone, increasing their share of the population from 8.4% to an estimated 34.8%.\[63\]** Other studies cite a figure of almost 50%.\[64\] In Erivan the proportion seemed to have increased from 24% to 53.8%.65 In return 35,000 of the 117,000 Muslims who once lived in Erivan and Karabakh fled Russian rule.\*\*\*\[*66\]* Source: The Nagorno-Karabakh Conflict: A Legal Analysis by Heiko Kr #252;ger He also provided his sources which for this paragraph were: 57) See Rau, Der Berg-Karabach-Konflikt, 2007, pp. 23, 25. 58) See also Rau, Der Berg-Karabach-Konflikt, 2007, p. 23. 59) See Swietochowski, in: Halbach/ Kappeler (eds.), Krisenherd Kaukasus, 1995, p. 161. 60) Cf.

    <TEXT>Today, the Armenian side once again informed that it had shot down another unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) of the Azerbaijan Army and, for real confirmation, published video footage of the allegedly that same UAV. However, a quick glance at the slow-motion frames of this video gives a clear perception that the "UAV" falling from the air and burning with a bright flame is an An-2 Light Multipurpose Aircraft. The question is, why does the Azerbaijan Army need an agricultural  #8220;kukuruznik #8221; (corn crop duster) when the most modern types of weapons and military equipment are available in the armament of the Armed Forces? The answer is simple. This way the Armenian agitation using graphics and animation makes unsuccessful efforts to deceive the Armenian public, as well as to raise the physically broken spirit and morale of the Armenian soldier. In a word, all UAVs of Azerbaijan are undamaged and in service."

Although my field of medicine is different, but I receive information from my doctor friends who directly work with wounded soldiers.

I no longer intend to endure it, you can judge me for it and even my thoughts can shape me as a persona "enemy of the people".

    <TEXT>Yes, exactly. For example, today Arif Yunus wrote this: "First again, a brief summary of the latest events of the past day and today's morning. Probably, many people already know that yesterday Ilham Aliyev announced the release of Fizuli and the surrounding villages of Gochahmedli, Chimen, Juvarly, Pirakhmedli, Musabeyli, Ishigly and Dedeli. #160;But I am glad to write about it again, because, as in the case of Hadrut, the president simply confirms what I have already reported here before. So with the city of Fizuli I informed you here two days ago. It's just that the city itself and these and other previously liberated villages are empty and destroyed, where the main battles were going beyond certain heights. And now the entire neighborhood has been completely cleared of Armenian subdivisions and Ilham Aliyev could calmly declare it."</TEXT>

    <TEXT>bro, you have no idea about them. I have met tons of them, one of them is my best friend. They love everything about Azerbaijani films, musics, i mean it is their culture too, just as it is our culture. They know North Azerbaijani films, for example, they love Arshin Mal alan a lot. They listen every Azerbaijani song, from old musicians like Sovket elekberova to Uzeyir Mehdizade. They listen all of them. For example my Tabrizian friend listens Azeri rap the most,he listens Xpert, Paster, Jin and his most favourite rapper is Koryolcu. Also, when we get high with friends, he sometimes opens songs like "qozumada deyil dunya" and "hallana hallana hallana gezirem" :d :d</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Hello u/Soulis_Greece, firstly, there is no such thing as being "ethnically Turkish". Someone being Turkish means that person being citizen of Turkey, so no. We are not citizens of Turkey that's why we are not Turkish. We are citizens of Azerbaijan, so we are Azerbaijani. Now, are Azerbaijanis ethnically Turkic (*not Turkish*)? Yeah, sure. Except minority ethnicities like Talish, Lezgin, Avar, Thsakur, Jews and etc. people, majority of Azerbaijani citizens are ethno-linguistically turkic. Genetically, we are primarily descend from Iranic people followed by strong/significant secondary Anatolian and Medieval Turkic descent, and some notable Caucasian related ancestry as well. The ethnogenesis of Azerbaijani Turks (*not Turkish*) began with the settlement of Seljuk era [Oghuz\_Turks](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oghuz_Turks) in Azerbaijan and their intermarriage with the mainly Iranic locals ([Medes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medes) for example), followed by centuries of back migrations into Azerbaijan from Anatolian Turkic tribes/groups (notably the [Qizilbash turks](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Qizilbash) during the Safavid Empire) further intermarrying with the population. If you wanna know more information about history and genetics of Azeris (Azerbaijanis or Azerbaijani turks -- gt; whatever you wanna call it), here is a nice explanation: [https://www.reddit.com/r/azerbaijan/comments/iw7xda/the\_genetic\_origin\_of\_azerbaijani\_turks/](https://www.reddit.com/r/azerbaijan/comments/iw7xda/the_genetic_origin_of_azerbaijani_turks/)</TEXT>
