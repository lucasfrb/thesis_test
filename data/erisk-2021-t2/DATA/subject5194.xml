    <TITLE>Homophobia [controversial]</TITLE>
    <DATE>2018-12-04 05:31:19</DATE>
    <TEXT>I know this will anger some people and please others. I have lived in Qatar for almost 18 years, and I have noticed that people here are hostile to homosexuals. I understand that it is part of Islam and all, but there is a part of me that thinks that people are a but hypocritical. If a westerner saw some of the traditions that Qataris have, they would think Qataris are homosexual in their actions. Some examples: Eskimo kissing strangers, fingering each others butts as a joke (mostly with teenagers), and teens imitating a female moan with friends. The reply I get is that it is tradition, but what bothers me is the hypocrisy.</TEXT>

    <TITLE>Rise in homosexual actions in Qatar</TITLE>
    <DATE>2018-12-04 05:45:04</DATE>
    <TEXT>Qatar is a Middle East country that is Islamic. In the past 20 years there has been an increase in  #8220;homosexual #8221; actions between young male children. These kids would finger each others butts for  #8220;fun. #8221; They would act feminine for attention for their friends, yet the culture there is extremely masculine. I think because Qatar segregates the sexes in society, male teens don #8217;t have contact with females, so they turned to  #8220;artificial #8221; femininity. The same could be said about female teens. Becoming masculine gives them favorability with other females. I don #8217;t know if I worded my argument well, but I think if a society segregated the two sexes too much, society would create the needed sex.</TEXT>

It was built after the death of the prophet by Umar ibn Al-Khatab and a jewish rabbi from Yemen converted into Islam and tricked Umar to conquer the land. It helped legitimize his blood lust. I believe that Al-Aqsa mosque is a mosque in heaven. Aqsa means  #8220;distant #8221; Back to your idea. I think it is wrong for Iran as a government to fulfill religious goals.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I hope this will give you a picture of how the prophet was a secularist. For a government to exist, it need three pillars. First, it needs a permanent army. The prophet and the Islamic community didn #8217;t have a permanent army. The prophet would just call upon his friends and followers to come and fight/defend their land. It #8217;s evident that this army was not trained for war because most of the people had their own occupations and some even hid in their house to escape war. After a battle, this army would just disintegrate and disappear. Second, it needs a permanent treasury. The prophet didn #8217;t have a treasury. He asked his followers to pay charity and Zakat and this money was used to help the poor, and all the money would used for the poor. You could count this as a tax, but this was all voluntary. At the end of the year, the treasury would be emptied and has to be started again for the next year. Third, it needed people to govern and a police force to enforce the laws. The prophet had neither. People lived their lives without being forced to follow Islamic jurisprudence. So, to conclude. Islam is a personal religion and not a governing religion, and it fits in a secular society. We should remember the verse  #8220; #1604; #1575;  #1575; #1603; #1585; #1575; #1607;  #1601; #1610;  #1575; #1604; #1583; #1610; #1606;" (There is no compulsion in religion). tl;dr, Islam never had a government and it #8217;s a personal religion.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>There is no easy fix. You #8217;re in an age where your biology screams at you and you feel overwhelmed. Marriage isn #8217;t an easy thing. What do you have to offer to get married? Are you ready to give half you life and energy to another person? Do you have the time to comfort your partner in times of trouble? Are you yourself in a good place? All these questions are necessary to even start to think of getting married. I share your feeling about Muta #8217;. I know this opinion is very controversial and I will get some heat for saying this, but to me, Muta #8217; is just prostitution with extra steps and with a religious veil. The common advice people would give is to pray, fast, and read the quran, but this is only to keep you on the straight path. I don #8217;t advise you to do this but it worked for me. I explored the borders of sexuality. I study in the US and instead of isolating myself form the other sex, I got more contact and this made the other sex more human that a need (if that makes sense). This will help remove the image that triggers this feeling in you.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I believe that the definition of what a government is is universal through the ages, so I #8217;m not using a modern standard. There is no government without a standing army and a source of revenue. I believe that the Caliphs have used Islam to create a government as a legitimizing force. I can #8217;t call a Caliph as just or representing Islam when he began fighting over power before burying his prophet and mentor. Islam is only a personal religion and not a philosophy that can govern society because to govern a society means using force, and that is contradictory to the verse " #1604; #1575;  #1575; #1603; #1585; #1575; #1607;  #1601; #1610;  #1575; #1604; #1583; #1610; #1606;" (There is no compulsion in religion). This mean that only the individual can apply a punishment on himself, and it shouldn #8217;t be forced on him. Note: This is my understanding and philosophy on the role of Islam in the world, and I have come to this conclusion through years of reading, meditation, and learning.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>It #8217;s been a long time hasn #8217;t it. It feels like only a few days have passed by, but at the same time feels decades have passed. Your memories keep on roaming around my life, and it #8217;s new to me. Yes, I have read the email. Yes, I have replied. I #8217;m not in a good place in life right now. I don #8217;t know if what happened between us is causing all my problems, or that I #8217;m just still attached to the past. I feel alone in this crowed world. I believe it #8217;s because I lost someone who made me feel wanted. Someone who made me feel loved and appreciated. I lost that. I #8217;m trying to get back what you offered me, and it #8217;s causing me problems. I developed an eating disorder. I lost 20kg because I keep throwing up my food. I believe I #8217;m doing that just so I can have a chance of meeting someone like you who can fill the void that was created. I also continued hurting myself. My soul is crushed because I know this message won #8217;t reach you. I #8217;m scared to talk to you again. I don #8217;t know if you still hate me. I know it #8217;s really difficult to communicate, but know that I don #8217;t hate you. I also don #8217;t blame you for your actions. I really hope I hear from you again.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Peterson makes the distinction between being kind and being harmless. As other redditors have mentioned, being harmless just means *inability* to do harm. Being kind means that you have all the opportunity to do harm, which is appealing, but you stop and become *unwilling* to do harm. Keanu probably means *harmless* because being kind is not as common as people think. We are mainly harmless.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>tl;dr I #8217;m a muslim that believes that everyone lives there own lives and they have their own beliefs and ideologies. No one can force you to do something you don #8217;t believe in. Plus some Jordan Peterson. Some history. I was born and raised in Qatar in a very religious and conservative household. I was indoctrinated into becoming a radical muslim since I was in the cradle. In my youth I would call for the death of america and the west(democracy). Ironically, I was also a vivid communist, but I was 14 at the time. The only thing that saved me was that I belong to the Shia sect of Islam. The Shia sect is more forgiving in its theology and more open individual choice. Short theology lesson: The main reason the Shia sect was created was because it was anti-state and anti-authoritarian. It basically began as a revolution against the people that wanted to make Islam into a government that ruled and conquered. The one major event that truly transformed me was when I graduated high school and decided to study in the US. In my second semester, I started to feel safe to read about controversial topics. I stumbled upon Jordan Peterson. He saved me from being ideologically possessed. I tell learned about the horrors of authoritarian regimes, especially the Soviet Union. Finally, I have summarized my religion and my political beliefs in two Quranic verses  #8220;For you is your religion, and for me is my religion #8221;[109:6] and  #8220;There shall be no compulsion in the [acceptance of] the religion... #8221;[2:256]. People have different life choices and no one can force people to live a certain way. Either through taxation or force.</TEXT>

    <DATE>2020-03-03 21:16:04</DATE>
    <TEXT>I #8217;m as pro-life as a person could be, but the display in front of the JC is disgusting. Do these people expect to change people #8217;s minds? If there was a chance of having a discussion, then they have destroyed any chance of a dialogue. I really hope that better representatives of the pro-life cause would come to campus instead of them.</TEXT>

    <DATE>2020-03-11 04:49:31</DATE>
    <TEXT>It #8217;s midnight and I can #8217;t sleep. I can #8217;t sit still or chill. Something is bothering me, but I can #8217;t name it or point at it. It #8217;s like a black fire burning inside me. It burns with such heat that is melts all that #8217;s happy or sad. I can #8217;t find where it #8217;s coming from. I would imagine that a burning fire this hot would create a light that can be seen, but this fire is heavy and black. I search within me to find it, but with no use, I can #8217;t find it. Breathing so heavy as though the reaper himself is pulling me. If only I knew where it came from. I have asked all the people I know if I have wronged them. They all say is no, but I know that #8217;s not true. I have wronged them in some way for I can see it in their eyes. I see the pain I have caused them. I see the tears that have ran out because of me. I tried my best to clean up my mistakes, but this guilt it not leaving me. Maybe I have wronged God himself. Maybe I have wronged myself. Maybe my whole life is wrong. Should I weep and cry. Should I shout and yell. Should I leap and bleed. What dance should I dance? What ritual should I play? What prayer should I say? What sacred act of atonement should I do? To whom should I turn to? Mother, father, sister, brother, friend, foe, lover? Who in this world can I turn to so they can relieve my pain. The one source of bliss and ease has been God. For He knows what I did. For He knows how I feel. For he knows what I think. For every time I come at his door asking, He opens his gates and opens his arms. But how can I come now and I have broken my promises to Him time and time again? How can I face Him knowing what I did? How can I forgive myself after He has done what I asked him to do, and I have broken my vows. I have yet to lose hope, for there is a flaming ember inside of me. Light will always eat the dark no matter how dark it is. Light has always been the source of growth. For even in the darkest caves can be lit with light. For all I have to do is follow the light and be free.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>**Guilt** The clock struck midnight and I cannot sleep I cannot sit still for there is a dark fire burning deep It #8217;s melting everything inside me happy and sad I cannot locate the source and it #8217;s driving me mad I would imagine fire this hot would create some light A black fire heavy and hot moving from left and right Breath so heavy as though the reaper himself arrived Something from my dark past has been revived A flame so hot it melts all hope Nothing remains except the rope Slowly moving within me Eating away at me every second How can something this hot be so dense? Dragging me behind, stuck in a fence Sinking through the sands of time Unable to escape this steep climb Even the darkest caves can be lit up But what can light up my cave? If the exploding heat produced no flame How can I see what should be tame? Maybe I have wronged a friend Maybe I have wronged myself Maybe I have wronged God himself Maybe my whole life is wrong Should I weep and cry? Should I shout and yell? Should I leap and bleed? Should I bow and pray? What dance should I dance? What ritual should I play? What prayer should I say? What scared act of atonement should I do? To whom should I turn to? Mother or Father Sister or Brother Friend or Foe Hater or Lover Who in this world do I turn to so they can relive my pain? Who can extinguish this burning flame inside me?</TEXT>

    <TITLE>(Blank) note</TITLE>
    <DATE>2020-03-14 20:00:46</DATE>
    <TEXT>I want to write a (blank) note so badly, but I fear that if I wrote such a note, I would be opening a door that would be difficult to close. Every day I #8217;m drowning in the sea of thought. Every day I #8217;m sinking in this dark ocean of emotion. I #8217;m afraid of starting such a note because I know that it #8217;s a slippery slope from the sane to the insane. How do you even start writing such a note. Should I start by thanking everybody who stood by my side or do I start by naming everyone who caused any harm. How do I even explain what led me to this place if I cannot even name what #8217;s inside of me. I tried writing my emotions in poetry hoping that the abstract nature of poetry clarified my emotions. A part of me wants to tell people about my thoughts because I think I owe them a warning before I do anything. The problem is that if I told them that means I #8217;m not serious about it. It means that I still have hope left in me. It means that I #8217;m hoping that they will pull me out of this deep hole I have landed in. Maybe I #8217;m in this temporary state of mind in which my isolation is just a mirage in this empty barren land. Maybe somebody opened this door and I just had the curiosity to enter. I don #8217;t even know why am writing this message. I think deep down I know that somebody out there somebody close to me would be reading this. I know for a fact that they will be reading this. I know for a fact that they would be destroyed by reading such a statement and I hope that it causes them less pain than what I #8217;m feeling right now. Maybe confessing my sins and emotions in a place where nobody cares where nobody can judge me where nobody can be mad at me would help me process what I #8217;m feeling. The problem is that I don #8217;t know what I #8217;m feeling I don #8217;t know what monster lives inside of me. I tried everything to kill this darkness, this monster inside of me. I tried opening up, but that lead nowhere. I tried making new friends and making new connections so that maybe I can have a crutch, so I don #8217;t fall down. I even tried buying a car so I would be away to become distracted so I do not spiral out of control. I tried praying and I don #8217;t know if it has worked or not. I feel lonely. I want someone by my side. I want someone who I can hug and release all this pressure and darkness. I want a companion that I can take care of. I want to feel needed.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Short post Cutting your forearms in the shower sucks. Your skin gets wet. The blade gets wet. Everything gets wet. I tried cutting myself but it just doesn #8217;t work. I usually start by just tracing the blade on my arm and scratch it. Then slowly build up the force until I see progress, but this doesn #8217;t work in the shower. I can #8217;t even feel the pointy edge of the blade. Maybe it #8217;s a good thing that I failed 3 times already. If anyone is reading this, don #8217;t worry I #8217;m already seeking help. Things are improving slowly. I #8217;ll be alright.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I had a talk with my dad today about what is pro-consumer. I told him that banning cigarettes is anti-consumer and anti-liberty. He said that it was pro-consumer because the state is protesting their health. I responded by asking if the state banned Pepsi (he loves Pepsi a lot) because it #8217;s bad for you because you #8217;re diabetic. He said no they shouldn #8217;t ban Pepsi because it #8217;s not as harmful even though it causes more harm to him than cigarettes. So it #8217;s ok to take away people #8217;s liberties to freely buy and consume as long as you get to decide what #8217;s good for them or not.</TEXT>

    <TITLE>I just want to fucking die</TITLE>
    <DATE>2020-05-18 05:17:44</DATE>
    <TEXT>I #8217;m so sick of living. I sit on my rooftop almost everyday just imagine what would it be to let go. Everyday I get closer to the edge, but I don #8217;t actually do it. I #8217;m not afraid of dying. I #8217;m afraid of surviving. If I was certain that falling would kill me then I would have done it years ago. Maybe I tell myself this because I don #8217;t want to admit that I don #8217;t want to die. With every passing second, the world gets darker. With every breathe I take, my chest gets heavier. With every heartbeat, my will to live leaves me. I don #8217;t have a reason to be depressed, and this frustrates me because I can #8217;t fix my situation if I don #8217;t know what #8217;s causing it. Maybe I #8217;m just weak and spoiled. Maybe I can #8217;t tolerate mild pain. Maybe this is normal life and I #8217;m just complaining. I want to say this to the people I care about, but the pain of making them worry about me is worse. I will absorb as much pain in this world as possible and perhaps I will leave it a more happier place.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I won #8217;t say I feel your pain, but I understand it. I met someone on reddit almost a year ago. I cared for her a lot. I would stay up all night waiting for her text. She suffers from depression. I spent all my days worrying about her. I even risked getting caught by the police because of her. Then one day I get a message from her saying that she doesn #8217;t need me anymore. It shattered my world. I developed an eating disorder because of this that I still suffer from to this day. We reconnected a month ago and she explained her actions. I still care about her, and I want to see her happy. Hey if you need to talk, please feel free to DM me. I can #8217;t sleep and my mind is spiraling and would appreciate a distraction.</TEXT>

    <TITLE>Qatar - Afghan Brothers Restaurant - difficultly [8/10]</TITLE>
    <DATE>2020-06-03 04:25:40</DATE>
    <TEXT>This restaurant is not anxiety friendly because everything is rushed, so I #8217;ll try my best to show you how to order. 1 - When you enter, you #8217;ll go towards the cashier/front table. You have two options [Floor or Table]. Floor - It is a semi closed room with an Arabian feel to it. If you don #8217;t like to eat in front of people then I would suggest selecting this. One downside is that you #8217;ll have to eat on the floor, but that #8217;s part of the experience. Table - basically you #8217;ll be seated on a table in the open. The place is a bit crowded, so you #8217;ll be really close to other tables. 2 - After you told them your option, they will either show you to your table/room or you have to go there yourself alone. If you chose to private room, then you would go up the stairs. You might meet a staff member which you ask to show you an empty room. They might show you or tell you the room number. You go there inside and wait until someone comes to take your order. Note: you might see people take off there shoes before getting in the room. This is traditional, you feel free to keep your shoes but it #8217;s uncomfortable. 3 - You will see a bunch of menus on the table/floor. Take them and start browsing. The waiter will come and ask for your order. Start with the appetizers then move to the main course. Side note: not a lot of people order appetizers. When you get to the main course. Specify if you want it in one plate of separate plates. One plate means that they will serve your food from one large plate so everyone will eat from it. This is the traditional serving. Separate plates means everyone has their own plate. After ordering, tell them your drinks. 4 - The food will come in 2 minutes so be prepared to eat right away. It is difficult to get the attention of the waiter, so you might need to raise your voice a little bit. You might want to ask for silverware because the food is traditionally eaten with your hands. 5 - After you #8217;re done eating, you go wash your hands and go to the cashier and tell them your table number or your room number and pay. This restaurant is difficult to deal with because everything is rushed and loud. The staff is a bit unfriendly because of the high workload.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>There is this verse in the Quran that I live by  #8220;There shall be no compulsion in [the acceptance] the religion.... #8221; (2:256) and I wish all muslims can really go by this chapter in the Quran. It #8217;s called  #8220;The Disbelievers #8221; it #8217;s very short but it can #8217;t be any clearer.  #8220;Say,  #8216;O disbelievers, I do not worship what you worship. Nor are you worshipers of what I worship. Nor will I be a worshiper of what you worship. Nor will you be worshipers of what I worship. For you is your religion, and for me is my religion. #8221; I agree wholeheartedly with you that people should chose their own beliefs. Not only that, but they have to truly know what those beliefs are and not just follow someone #8217;s words. I do however believe that religious organizations are important in people #8217;s lives because they give people a sense of unity. People can unity under one roof towards a set of values. I didn #8217;t get your point about faith being personal and not an institution. If you meant that religious organizations should stay the hell out of politics and that politics shouldn #8217;t interfere with religion then I agree. This has been a delightful exchange of ideas and thoughts. You were very respectful and you made your points clear. Edit: spelling.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>What I #8217;m about to say doesn #8217;t represent mainstream Islam. Mainstream Islam is more harsh and cruel towards non-Muslims. This is what my Islamic studies teacher told me  #8220;all kafir(nonbelievers), Christians, and Jews will be sent to hell and punished by God. #8221; Of course this is contradictory to the Quran. In Islam, it is believed that God is all merciful and compassionate. No being past or future can be more merciful than Allah/God. Here is how my father explained how merciful God is in Islam. Imagine a mother that gave birth to a son, and this son grew up to become rotten. He always disobeys his mom and steals money from her. If one day, someone tied up the son and brought the mom in front of her son and gave her a branding iron. The mom has her free will and no one is forcing her to do anything. Would she torture her son even though he is a bad son. Of course not. If a mortal can be this merciful and forgiving then what about God. I will let you draw your own conclusions. Here is a verse that speaks of exactly what you are asking about.  #8220;Indeed, those who believed and those who were Jews or Christians or Sabeans [before Prophet Muhammad] - those [among them] who believed in Allah and the Last Day and did righteousness - will have their reward with their Lord, and no fear will there be concerning them, nor will they grieve. #8221; -2:62 From what I understand there are 3 criteria -Believe in one God -Believe that you will be judged for what you do in this life -Be righteous in your actions Thank you for asking this wonderful question. I admire your interest in morality and religion.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I #8217;m with you on that. I was just playing the devil #8217;s advocate. I #8217;m extremely against pedophilia. These people have a mental illness that need to be treated and they should be punished if they act on their impulses just like rapist. I will get hate for saying this. I believe that homosexuality is a mental illness, but that doesn #8217;t mean that we can discriminate against them.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Yes, because biologically anything that is not straight is abnormal just like any other biological abnormality. This will trigger a lot of people but we shouldn #8217;t normalize homosexuality. We need to treat it as a biological abnormality and find a  #8220;cure #8221;.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Thanks for the clarification. I understood you wrong and I agree with you. People with mental disorders (whatever that happens to be) are still valid and should not be invalidated. I also agree with you that homosexuality is just like OCD or ADD. It #8217;s a mental illness and we shouldn #8217;t say to stay the same. If someone had schizophrenia, we shouldn #8217;t say they #8217;re normal and let them be. We should seek to find a  #8220;cure #8221; even if it is politically incorrect. Again, I agree with you. We should judge people by their actions.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>The basic idea is that in any creative work, 50% of the product is produced by the square root of the population. Here #8217;s an example: if you have an artist with 100 songs 10 songs will have 50% of the views. If you have an artist with 10,000 song 100 songs will have 50% of the views. This also goes for money. If you randomly select 100 people from the world 10 people will have 50% off the total cash and three people of the 10 will have the next 50% of the cash. https://youtu.be/TcEWRykSgwE</TEXT>

You can #8217;t be evil if you don #8217;t have the proclivity to evil. Being born good means you #8217;re harmless. A rabbit it #8217;s tamed because it doesn #8217;t attack you. It #8217;s born with no ability to harm. A lion who can fight his hunger instead of eating his master is something more powerful. I like how Dr. Peterson said that Harmless =/= good.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>That is a very good point about Paarthurnax. He doesn #8217;t do anything to fight evil. Same with the grey beards. Skyrim is in ruins and in a civil war and they are in their high castle. Now that I think about it. The Blades (I think) are the good guys. They are directly fighting the evil by gaining power to be able to withstand the apocalypse. Damn I love this topic. Now I want to replay Skyrim. u/Mitchel-256 thank you for that descriptive reply. It cleared your point, and I have learned a new point of view. Thank you.</TEXT>
