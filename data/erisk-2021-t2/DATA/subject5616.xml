    <TEXT>Oh sorry I forgot. Yep it's in your post. Anyway, your theories are great. It would be nice if this is really gonna happen. My theory for the final episodes are: The fighting characters are gonna be snapped (May, Daisy, maybe Robocoulson, Mack, Yo-yo), the chronicoms, with the FitzSimmons family surviving it then time jump to 2023. then the second snap happened, the chronicoms were the first to approach the remaining members, they fight them as hard as they can but they're struggling, luckily, the snapped members are back to rescue them. And I don't even know if this is gonna be happening, just a theory, you know the show, the big bad at the start of the season will either be joining another big bad at the season finale or not be the big bads anymore.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Thursday morning: Watch AoS new episode live at 10am if the internet would let me. (Our internet is so slow, so no I will not watch an episode that is not continuously playing.) Not opening this subreddit to avoid spoilers. Thursday afternoon and night: Download the new episode and the subtitles and watch it again and again. Finally open this subreddit. Friday-Tuesday: rewatch the previous seasons(I'm currently rewatching season 3) Check this subreddit Make theories about next week's episodes Check youtube for new videos for the last episode Before going to sleep: Thinking about what the finale would be? Thinking whether my fave ships will end up together. (I hope Zephyr one will be still alive til the finale) Wednesday morning: Waking up thinking that the new episode will be out in less than 24 hrs Rest of the day: Same as Friday-Tuesday Wednesday night: Same things to do before going to sleep. And the cycle continues... you have your own weekly AoS routine? Feel free to reply down below.</TEXT>
