    <TEXT>How exactly is the probability calculated? I simulated spending 2000 stones on multisummons first and singles later, three times per test, and the percentage of ssrs on singles was constantly around 15%, whereas the percentage of ssrs on multis was constantly around 10%. Are your stats attendible or did you proceed approximately? Thanks, I'm still just trying to understand whether multis or singles are better.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I mean its a great WT card, especially since my Extreme team was lacking, everyone was pretty shit other than Merged and phys Broly, so I'm not whining or anything, just two dupes of THAT card, add to that dropping Majuub twice later on, I just felt like the game was trolling me, telling me "you want majin vegeta? Oh youll get majin vegeta! Oh so not that majin? Well heres another good guy with majin in his name!" lol</TEXT>

    <TEXT>What gets me angry about this card is that, having started the game when Vegito Blue and Rose came out, he literally came out in one banner which is Str Cell, and in JP from what I understand, he hasn't been featured since. Which means that if I want this card I'll have to wait until God knows when, probably when a new Ss3 Vegeta comes out with an updated 50 Stamina event. That's gonna be at least eight months from now, if not much more. So yea this is probably the most OP card that Dokkan doesn't want us to have. I think they should probably do an event that drops special stones which let you buy those older cards newer players didn't have a chance to pull (like Trunks Ss2, Vegeta Ss3 Str etc) before they become obsolete and useless.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>In my opinion, no. With 140 stones you are probably gonna grab one of the featured units on Gokus banner (which is the banner I advise you to pull on seeing your cards), and if you're lucky it might be Goku. Otherwise the game is still gonna give you chances to pull him, and with your Super Str team being quasi optimal I'd avise to persist on Goku until you drop him.</TEXT>

You're missing a sealer if you go with Ss3 Godtenks but with the appropriate luck you might figure it out...

    <TEXT>Trading would be opened only to 250+ rank accounts, for cards of approximately the same team cost (for example unawakened neo god leads would only be exchangeable for the tUR older cards or other neogod leads, and not [Pan for Ss4 Goku]) to avoid farming accounts. And I'd add a max of 5 trades per month (and that could be done with a currency like the hourglasses that have a limit in the baba shop of 5 per month). I'd say that's enough for transparency, so the game doesn't get too easy. And I'm no game development genius, they knkw this stuff, which means that trading is not implemented NOT because of the reasons you'll find listed on this subreddit which include "CaUsE pEoPLe wOuLd rEroLL aLL tHe tiMe" etc etc cause I showed you how to avoid those problems. They simply don't implement trading because to them it's not convenient money wise. I have tons of friends that don't need an extra Rose, and frankly I could have done great without a third Gogeta. But they want me to pull, and pull, and pull for that Rose. Thats Bandai for ya.</TEXT>

Can you be really lucky? I know, I pulled a truckload of cards I needed with a 14% rate, 9 SSRs out of 64 Tickets. Just because you're unlucky doesn't mean the game's rigged. The average'll always be a ~10% rate with people going as high up as 40% and as low as 1%.

    <TITLE>The Problem with Categories:</TITLE>
    <DATE>2017-08-03 07:21:52</DATE>
    <TEXT>A brief intro: I expected the meta to shift in this direction as soon as I realized the meta was spiralling to "an always bigger buff to an always smaller group of units". I came to the game with Super Vegito and the 70% meta to all that-Type Units, whereas now we had a 120% meta to all Super or Extreme that-Type Units. I figured the next meta would be one of two choices: either a tradeoff of ki and stats the same way Int Trunks and Merged Zamasu had only +1ki; or what we got, which is an infinitely larger reduction of the character pool to choose from for an even bigger buff. Now, basically saying I told you so, here are my issues: 1. Teams from now on are going to be incredibly unbalanced. What I mean by this is categories are not Types, chosen by the Dokkan team, so if a particular team, Super-Agl lets say, is lacking something in respect to Super-Str, making the two incredibly unbalanced and pushing everybody to use one rather than the other, they can introduce a Super Agl sealer for example to balance the two (of course its an example, since the teams are both incredibly good already). With categories they'd be forced to create a card of THAT category to change the team, not just that type, which could mean having to say "Mhmm, lets add another Super Gogeta, only this one tanks"; or a new base Gotenks, or another Ss3 Gotenks, etc etc. Before this new meta, balancing the teams was easier, now we might risk them creating odd categories in order to avoid breaking the game. So not creating a category called "Saiyans" cause duh. Or excluding characters from a unit from that group to avoid breaking the game. The same way I think "Shadow Dragon Arc" is a stupid sounding category (my issue is with the Arc part) and them excluding Goku because the art is from the Baby saga is a stupid excuse to not make a team with Omega, Gogeta, Goku, and Vegeta all at a 300% buff to stats. 2. Its going to be the most annoying thing ever to actually have barely 7, maybe 8 cards to choose from in the pool. I was thinking about Ss4 Gogetas team, in JP, and basically the setup would be [[ Furry Gogeta - Int Super Gogeta - Phy Ss3 Gotenks - Phy Ssj Gotenks - Teq Ss3 Adult Gotenks - Base Form Gotenks ]]. The team itself is amazing, imagine two of the hardest hitting units in the game, Int Gogeta and Phy Ss3 Gotenks, along with the new Gogeta, having a 300% boost to their stats. Super cool and everything. My problem is that, if I lack a card, or if I want to run something different, I can't without basically shooting myself in the foot. The only other cards that fall into the fusions category are fat failure Gogeta (Veku), Ssj Adult Gotenks, and pretty much thats it. You could run Ss3 Angel Goku for that 50% and 1 ki to Teq Units, but a 200% reduction in stats in respect to the other cards would make him hit barely harder than just base Gotenks. So that makes him extremely unviable. For example, on my Vegeta team, I like to run Agl Godku quite simply because I like the card, so I prefer him over Agl SsB Vegeta. Now I don't have Ssb Vegeta, but even if I did I still wouldn't run him over Godku, even though that is the optimal unit. But if I did want to run him, having Godku still allows me to play, it's not like I'm running a Saibamen. Because the meta right now gives options that are not optimal but still viable. With the new meta coming tomorrow the optimal units to run are gonna be the only possible units to run. And that brings to the final problem: the meta ruling the game. 3. As of right now, even though both furries are out, I still have tons of friends running double Vegito Blue leads, cause in the end it makes sense to run your favorite units for a 100% buff to stats, making the game reasonably challenging in respect to the 240% boost double furries offer. With the next meta, how many people are gonna play 100% units in a 300% meta? I find it really hard to believe, but people are still gonna do it, I know I am. Just not that many. Its far more enjoyable to play with the sickest looking units even though they hit slightly less hard, but when the difference is so vast, a lot of people are gonna give that up. Tl;dr This meta will ruin the game cause [salt starts raining] 1. Categories are a shitty, restrictive, hard-to-keep-up-with idea 2. They are taking the choice away from the players in respect to the units to run 3. They are taking the choice away from the players in respect to the team to run Is it fixable? Sure, by adding some better units and by being extra careful to not create stupid categories and placing stupid units in them, by making categories slightly more broad (though not broader than the entire Super/Extreme-"that" type pool), by finding a way to slightly buff Super and Extreme Leads (I'd say 75% and +3 ki for VB and Rose and 100% and +1ki for MZ and Trunks). This keeps choice solid and the game not entirely about the current meta, still keeping the old units viable.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Of course, thats how they can keep this meta reasonable, but its gonna be even more work for them. The fact that single units fall into more than one category is refreshing, cause you could run a unit in a hypothetically infinite number of categories, my issue is that the category itself won't offer many choices, so if lets say tomorrow a Ssj God Goku comes out with its leader skill being +150% to Saiayans category, pulling on Gogeta, other than wanting the unit itself, is going to be incredibly stupid, because the whole Fusions team would still fall into the Saiyan team.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>That is exactly my point. The idea for the meta isn't bad, it's that introducing it this way, in my opinion, is fundamental for them to cash in, but isn't that appealing to me, because in truth I feel like they could have initially developed it better and then went on to release it. But again, as you put it, it gives many options for other groups of units I would have liked to see first.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I've read deeply into the *SPOILER ALERT AVERT YOUR EYES* Tyrion Targaryen/Blackfyre theories and the idea that's gnawing at the back of my mind is that, if it is true, he knows who he is, especially reinforced by Cersei asking him why he's siding with Daenerys. I think he found out about his real father, he knows Dany is his half sister, and he was waiting for the right moment to tell her because of the Targaryen love sibling incest thing. So he sided with her because he might have seen a chance to marry her and become King/Husband of the Queen; seeing Jon makes him realize he's always gonna be a dwarf and thus he can only aspire to be Hand. I don't think his ambition is ill-willed, he's not power hungry, he wants power to help those that need it, and he's saddened by the realization it will never happen. That's why I expect him either to die an honourable death or end up on the throne were Jon and Dany killed in the future. He would in theory have a claim tied to his blood and good intentions to reign. Juuust a theory though!</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I rate that, but I'll never understand why Cooler, Super 17, Ss3 Broly, Kid Buu or Janemba deserved a spot as a 120 Lead more than Cell. I'll break it down; **Cooler** : I respect what you said, so I'll stamp my approval as Cooler as the E. Phy Lead, even though were I to choose, I would have gone with Cell. **Kid Buu** : Ooh don't get me started on Kid Buu. Ffs he wasn't even the strongest character in his arc, or the second strongest character, or the third. He wasn't even the strongest form of himself! Like literally it would have made more sense to use Buutenks, even he's more powerful than Kid Buu. He's not iconic, he's not a cool villain, he's not even that powerful. **Super 17** : Just the fact that he came from GT, and he was probably one of the worst 'serious' arcs of GT, makes me shake my head. They could have, and should have, gone with Baby, were they desperate to include GT in it. Or Syn Shenron, for the matter. They opted to use Super 17 as a 120 lead, which to me is insane. I know they wanted to put new characters, but I swear I would have rather they went with Cell. Use him as a support unit idk but he didn't deserve that spot. **Janemba** : I have a soft spot for Janemba, I really love his design and his powers, that sword and the fact that he dodges and stuff. However, I hated the idea of making opposite type, powered up reskins of him and Gogeta. Thats why I don't rate Int Gogeta or Phy Ss3 Gotenks for the matter, I'm still gonna pull on them but they didn't really try to implement anything new. And Janemba is really cool but Cell is probably the best Villain of DBZ when it comes to arc and motives, he deserved that spot more than Janemba did. **Ss3 Broly** : We all know this was vicious fanservice and nothing more, so I don't really need to say anymore. He was barely in a Videogame, he means nothing to fans, he's the worst character when it comes to motives in DB with the worst transformation in DB. Plus they really outdid themselves to make him a really bad card, so yea, great job Bamco. Cell on the other hand is probably one of the best villains ever seen in the series, with one the best set of powers, and has no usable cards. You can run Str Cell with Janemba, but not many pulled on that banner. Other than that there's Int and Teq Cell which are both pretty bad as of today, and the second form support unit to run with Broly. But it's not enough. And they could have made a really fun to use unit that maybe when he was hit by Supers that weren't deadly (e.g. on 200k hp super that hit for 160k) he would regenerate maybe half of that (or all of it to make it op) and hit that unit back with the same super, since he has that in his skillset to learn moves when he sees them. So this post has dragged on for too long, all I'm saying, **tl;dr** , I demand respect for Cell.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Tbh sometimes when you have these 90+ cards you tend to rely too much on them and your manneuver becomes centered on a single player rather than on the team. But I follow Prinsipe quite a bit and he has a thing for playing unconventional yet OP players that hes used to like Lozano and Son. And also, having played many games with If Nainggolan and 90 Gullit I prefer the Belgian. He feels closer to the ground and quicker to grab the ball, and when helped by tall CMs like Pogba and Vieira he handles the midfield like no one else.</TEXT>

When having a good time depends exclusively on winning, to the point where you're willing to gain an absurd advantage on your opponent, banging in insane goals with Gullit and R9, it makes the game awful for others. To me Fifa is having fun, thats why I dont exclusively use Low Drivs and the 41212 or the 4231. I play the game, these other people let the game play them.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>The only thing I hold with 99% certainty is that SB games depend so much on who scores the first goal. I win most games, but sometimes I find that when I'm distracted or careless, missing the first chance, and the AI scores the first goal, they tend to defend in godlike manners and are always quick on the turnover. When I start the game aggressive and get a one goal lead, no kidding I know I'll score 3-7 more depending on by how much I want to win. And I play on legendary. But really I think theres just different bots comanding these teams, each with its own personality, some more offensive, some more defensive. When I face the defensive AIs that are really there just for the tie, I tend to struggle much more, whereas when the other team is aggressive and tries to play I dominate. Once I get the first goal they tend to go almost all out attack leaving so much space open. This is all just a theory, don't get me wrong, but maybe the reason why the harder teams are lower rated is cause being the weaker side they try to play small team football only focused on parking the bus and countering. Every once in a while I get that 10-behind-the-ball game where the AI only defends, and those games are usually tight on the 0-0 when they get the last second counter and win.</TEXT>

I get they wanted a Real Madrid R9 and an Inter R9, a Napoli Maradona and a Boca Maradona, a Milan Nesta and a Lazio Nesta, a Parma Crespo and a Milan Crespo and so on, certain players meant a lot to more than one team. But if you put 3 of each, specifying what year that certain version of the Icon played in, it would be common sense to not have an "Icon" team but rather that particular team. It would make certain op cards be harder to hybrid, and nerf-without-nerfing some aspects of icons like Rui Costa or Maradona or Gullit. It would make teams much more varied.</TEXT>

Thing is, back in the old days when R2+R1+X used to be very effective for pressing, people used to be very aggressive, and with good timing skills worked out great. Now that Fifa 18 doesn't allow that kind of pressure anymore, most players act defensive and use L2 to stall with their defenders and press with their midfielders. That's why most of my skill runs happen against either Squad Battle teams on Legendary or not very experienced players. Cause smart players will probably stall with their defenders and not allow you to use skills to evade them.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Yea but I think the complaints come from the fact that even though CR7 in his prime was one of the best players of our generation, and right now is one if not the best player in the world, still isn't and wasn't as dominant in real life as he is in Fifa right now. He costs more than double what Messi costs, and it isn't because of pack weight. It's because as soon as you have him in your team you go to a new level. He handles better than most icons, he fucking skates all over the park and low drivs his shots all the way from his mansion in Madeira to the bottom corner quicker than a space shuttle. His long shots are insane, his ball control is absurd, and still feels stronger than Akinfenwas TOTS. When you see how realistically they handled some players, like Dinho or Messi, which are amazing but were made in such a way that you need to know how to use them to balance their strengths and weaknesses, and then you see CR7 and how he was just made to be God because he is EAs cover boy, it's irritating because you end up having a meta tilted by publicity and not by actual real life abilities.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I agree on the Messi side, thats why I said, "you can feel strengths and weaknesses", but Ronaldo in game has absolutely no cons. Especially in the last few years, he's much more of a poacher and less accurate outside of the box and on volleys. On Fifa, no matter where he shoots from, which foot, what height the ball is, he's gonna send it top corner. His ball control is not that good either, ofc its great but not to the level that he runs full speed with the ball inches from his feet. When he sprints irl he usually kicks the ball a few feet, never that close of a dribbler. His left foot feels way more than 4 stars, just yesterday I used Nif c. Ronaldo on 2 chem in draft, 90th minute so stamina depleted, after a skill run with the bar completely white, he scored an insane volley outside of the box with his left foot after doing EL TORNADO (sorry had to). So yea, its not that his abilities translate well, they just boost his abilities to the point where it seems as if all sliders are activated. But look, I'm gonna ask you this, why in goals of the week 90 percent of the insane longshots and volleys are by him? Even though statistically in game hes not the player with the highest long shots or volleys? Its not about being a consipracy, it might simply be in his custom animations combined with traits and abilities, the point is if I were ever to create a player with the same stats as him CR7 would still be better.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I don't agree, I think it's because he's so cheap. If I had to list my personal favourite Midfielders this year, I'd say 1. Pogba 2. Nainggolan 3. Kante 4. Tolisso OTW 5. Bakayoko 6. Vidal The only two I place on a higher pedestal are Pogba and Nainggolan, the other 4 are all close. And you notice Vidal, his hairstyle is weird too, you notice Kante for how short he is and his weird alien shaped head. Bakayoko doesnt stand out because of the blonde hair, he stands out because he's a really miniscule step down from Kante for 1/130th of the price. A similar comparison can be traced with De Gea and Fahrmann. Despite Ddg being the obvious better choice, he costs 50 times what Fahrmann does. And if those 200k in difference can be used to finish the Ferdinand or Desailly SBC, or buy Ramos and Boateng, then Fahrmann is the better choice. Kante is better than Bakayoko, just not 129 k better. The only midfielders which are worth that huge coin gap imo are Radja, Pogba, and the top tier icons. Plus, links are worth a lot too. Bakayoko is easy to hybrid cause he plays in a top club and is French. Gueye is unusable unless you use an all BPL team.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I don't agree with him, but I have the mental flexibility to understand where he's coming from. To get a 40-0 means balancing games between Fri-Sat-Sun, often getting 6-7 games under the belt by Friday morning and often finishing Sat night or Sunday morning for pros. That means that, hypothetically, pople that usually get 30-35 might wait and play the last games on Monday, when every pro will already be done with his games, thus playing Elite 3/Gold 1 players on Monday. The point of WL is challenging players by playing so many games, looking for commitment. I don't agree with the format at all, that's why I don't agree with him, but I get what he means. If I leave 10/15 games for Monday the level will be significantly lower than playing the same number of games on Sunday or Saturday. Blame EA.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>As Roma has no icons despite being probably the 4th biggest club in Italy. Totti, Batistuta, Falcao, Conti, Ancelotti, Voeller, Cerezo, Aldair, Cafu all deserve icon cards over some existing in-game. Some of Man U's biggest icons are missing, like Best, Giggs, Scholes, Cantona, Yorke  amp; Cole. And Man U is probably the biggest club in the prem. On the other hand you have icons like Hernandez, Pires, Kluivert, Inzaghi, Shearer, Petit, Larsson, Overmars, Litmanen, Laudrup, Blanc, Owen, that were either *iconic* for a gimmick (Inzaghi being the least gifted good footballer in history), *iconic* regionally (Larsson, Hernandez, Litmanen, Blanc, Laudrup) or they were *iconic* in the Prem (Petit, Overmars, Pires, Owen). I get that they need to boost sales so they put players that entice local gamers in Mexico, Sweden, Finland, France; I get that their biggest market is the UK so you have so many undeserving prem players, but even so. They used the word icon cause its so ambiguous. Legend implies some skill, to be an icon is to simply be a remembered footballer. Roger Milla was a remembered footballer, and they'll probably put him in game in the future over a WC winner like Luca Toni because people remember the dancing over actual abilities. That and him being from Africa (don't remember the country).</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Pires  gt; Conti is absurd. Conti won the WC and was undoubtedly the best player of the entire tournament, even Paolo Rossi who won the Balon d'Or told him "they gave me this because I scored goals and you did the assists, but you deserve it". Conti was both a club legend nearly bringing a smaller club like Roma to win the CL back when to qualify you had to win the League and noy just place top 4. Pires was an amazing player don't get me wrong, but not even close. I think you can compare Overmars to Cafu since one was a RM and the other also played LM (even though he did mostly play LW and LF). Falcao was probably one of the greatest Center mids in the world in his prime, combining pace and dribbling and passing, he was very similair to Iniesta nowadays. Petit again, good but not best in his time. But again, they were very different times and a different football the 80s vs the 2000s, so I get that the debate is pointless and a matter of opinions. But cba with the Shearer gt;Batistuta, thats just not true. Batistuta is second only to Messi in goals for a big national team like Argentina, the guy was a tank mostly for Fiorentina but still managed to win one of 3 scudettos for Roma. Like both on the iconic and the skill he wins big time over Shearer. Shearer is a club legend for Blackburn and NUFC but honestly not much other than that. He was an immense player don't get me wrong especially in the prem but to place him on the same level as Batigol is absurd. Ask anybody in Italy, no matter the team if Roma Lazio Fiorentina Juventus Inter, and Batistuta is probably second only to Ronaldo if not on par with R9 as best striker in Serie A history.</TEXT>

Since 100% of the people I know that play Fifa have experienced it in some way, shape, or form, having experienced it on my skin basically every game, knowing EA is a company known for its lack of transparency, knowing it's in their best interest to make games unpredictable and limit the skill gap, I am 100% sure that in some way shape or form games are piloted. I don't mean that there's active sliders, but rather, for example, that stamina/form affects teams differently. Yesterday I tied an absurd game 9-9. If I manage to upload it you'll clearly see my players running like crazy in the space and not missing a pass while we were tied 7-7, taking me up by two 9-7, and then in 2 half ET completely falling asleep, running at half the speed and missing every pass while his players did the exact opposite. I'm saying there must be some dynamic factor, like stamina or morale, that rather than depleting steadily shifts throughout the game.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>The only proof a non-dev like me can gather is my experience with the game. I don't think any of you are objective; it's evident just by switching pro clubs to Fut to kick off to online matches how completely different each experience is from the one before. For example my pro clubs player is 89 rated, with insane Icon level stats like 88 pace 92 shooting 90 passing 78 phys 90 dribbling. Yet when you compare him to Gabriel Jesus or any icon on FUT they are so much better. Its evident different game modes have different slider settings. Of course the only proof I can gather is by looking at a game code I would never understand or infiltrating EA. Which brings me to EA, a company known for its odd dealings, lack of transparency and unwillingness to ever even discuss touchy subjects like pack weight or momentum. I'm not being a tin-foil hat guy, I just don't get where your proof is if you only base yourself off of EAs word.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>99% of fifa players' experience. And why would they do this? Well amongst my group of friends I am by far the one with the best team (pack luck not actually grinding) and am definetely better than most of them. Yet I lose every once in a while with my 5 m team against friends with 80k teams that I usually thrash in kick off. Pushing me to believe if I upgrade my 87 Crespo to a 90 Crespo I wouldn't lose. If I upgrade Valencia to his IF. Upgrade Pogba 87 to his 90. Point is to do that stuff you need coins. How do you get quick coins? Packs.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>No no, I get it, I wasn't being clear. By using my example, I'm talking about someone who doesn't know about this stuff. If person "X" doesn't believe in handicap or momentum or scripting or is unaware of them, thats what I meant, well then when he loses he'll believe the reason is because his team isn't good enough. So he'll try to improve it. 80k teams can easily compete at high levels, I saw many top 100 pros using 300k teams as challenges and still landing top 100.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>When I use two strikers up top I tend to go for a finisher and a support, so my team rn is Crespo 87 - Nif Bale and it works out great for me. I used to run Griezmann as well as a support before switching to Bale. Larsson looks like he can do both, so I'd say either get Bale IF for that support kind of ST or if you wanna use Larsson as support get ADP prime and slap a Hunter on him.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I think the biggest problem lately is that rather than Ultimate Team, for sponsorship reasons, it became Ultimate French Premier League Team, which honestly drives me insane. I see people on reddit complaining about broken players, but honestly Fifa always had broken players: Doumbia, Emenike, Ibarbo, Taiwo, Dede, are the first that come to mind, Nilmar, Pato, Abate for the aficionados of the genre, but Fifa always had broken players. The difference is back then, if you wanted to go "broken", you had to choose whether you wanted to go with a Brazillian team, or a Russian team etc. Now they gave that hidden "broken" trait to only french and PL players, creating a meta, something I had seen much much less in older instalments, and it pisses me off.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I agree and wish they could, but sadly this would mean onlu players in the Prem would have accurate position lists. whereas smaller leagues would not be even looked at. They wouldn't know that a Romanian striker playing in 2. Bundesliga can also play LW cause nobody would care. I think the best way would be to simply enter two new types of consumable cards, LM  gt; CAM and RM  gt; CAM, therefore you'd just separate Offensive and Defensive players, maybe making consumable position changes more expensive so lets say playing Sanchez as a ST would cost you LF gt;LW, LW gt;LM, LM gt;CAM, CAM gt;CF, CF gt;ST, so ideally at least 5k coins or more so a position change is a real investment and not something you can do light heartedly. This would also make non-full player packs relevant again, cause everyone I know only ever buys 50, 100 or 125k packs, since they're the only packs actually worth something.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I think the 4312 isn't narrow. I play with alaba and valencia as full backs and bakayoko as cm with stay back while attacking, and often the formation widens up, either with the two STs running wide and the CAM acting as ST or (when I'm playing someone with park the bus) it automatically turns into a 3412 with every run alaba and valencia make on the flanks, and when I'm playing balanced my James and my Tolisso as CMs tend to do a lot of central and wide runs. I think the biggest con with the 4312 is (tin foil hat time) that it feels as if for some weird EA magic that one of the 3 attackers (two STs + CAM) performs always far below the other two. Most games I win I just see 2 out of 3 scoring insane goals and assists and the third sitting the game out missing anything. No idea why though.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I use Crespo 87; compared to NIF Aguero there's absolutely no discussion, Crespo has speed power and shooting. His prime is an upgrade on everything great about him, I prefer him. However, the only thing his prime does not upgrade much is his passing, which is acceptable when momentum is on your side, abysmal when the Fifa gods want you to lose. So overall I can tell you I will sell my normal Crespo to upgrade to his prime, but if you feel like passing is fundamental in your striker then I'm not so sure. Overall 87 Crespo has 350 goals in aroubd 350 apps for my club, so his average is for my standards insane considering I play him in a tandem with Bale with Prime Dinho in support. So I'd say Crespo over Aguero. And I'm a Roma fan so I'm totally not biased. If you support Milan/Parma/Lazio/Inter/Chelsea thats another reason to get him.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Tbh Juventus played like shit and still completely outplayed Spurs when Dybala Higuain and Costa started putting 20% effort. United was knocked out against Sevilla and that's outright embarrassing. Chelsea was completely outplayed by AS Roma both at home and away, and still need to face Bar #231;a in the second leg, and Liverpool played very well but still didn't face insane opponents. Tottenham beat Madrid when Real was still playing relatively poorly and out of form considering their usual. City is an insane team both individually and playstyle-wise and probably deserves to win the CL being imo the best team in europe. The only downside is they have so many young players that would be at their very first potential CL final, so here's to hoping they don't crack under pressure. Personally I think EA hugely favour the PL, especially considering that other than City and a few games by Burnley every other team defends like second graders. Just look at ratings refresh. How many players missed out on an upgrade, only to see Pogba +1 for nothing in the last two months, and not just him. I hear people wonder why Salah has been playing so well, even better than his two years at Roma, and it's fairly simple. Playing against teams in Italy that are humble at the top but still know how to defend and are solid at the back was hard for him, Salah is favoured by counterattack play, when he has lots of space to run. No wonder he was pocketed by Young or whatever against United since parking the bus is the only thing United does. Ranieri won the PL simply cause he taught his team the Italian way of defending. Tl;dr: no one is saying English teams are shit. Just that they are so shit at defending yet strong at the top that this makes their games entertaining but also occasionally making them look stupid. City this year is an ecception.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>My answer was to the OP regarding "good" pack luck days, and I feel it's true. Everytime I packed something decent, it was preceded or followed by something still good. When I packed Messi I packed Eriksen right before him, (both in 50k packa) when I packed TIF Firmino I also packed Kante and Thiago; yesterday I opened five 50 k packs; the firsts' best card was Rafael (79!) and it was followed by a Malcolm, a Naby Keita, a Callejon and a Carrasco. So i think pack weights do change individually and the "algorithm" calculating it shifts depending on a series of factors, even what particular day of the week/month/year it is. Edit: I have spent approx 300 #8364; on packs this year.</TEXT>

I use him as a striker with Bale, and strength wise, jumping wise, longshot wise, he was amazing no matter what Chem style. Honestly as a striker I don't use a lot of longshots and the few crosses I bang in were netted easily with 10 less jumping. 99 pace on Crespo is not as fast as 99 pace on Aubameyang, so I wanted as much pace as I could give him.

    <TEXT>The reasoning is simple; if you really want to play with them, and by really I mean REALLY, just by doing Squad Battles and Fut Champions every week, at an average level (Elite 3 and Gold 3) you'd have gained by now about 1.5 million ish. Add to that the packs that come with those rewards, the guaranteed profit SBCs, and ideally another million just by game earnings. I can guarantee you'd have your hands on one of those players. If you're not down for the grind, I get it, but don't complain you can't buy those players. I don't agree 100% with the model, imo you should at least be able, with effort, to sport 2 top tier icons by now, but I realize that not being a pro and not buying packs makes it impossible; I think they should up SB rewards and pack luck, but knowing how greedy they are this current model maximizes their profit and they'd never change it. Again, morally I don't 100% agree with them, because imo in theory the only difference it should make to afford great teams is time, so ideally buying packs should get you to endgame quicker whereas not spending a dime should in the end still let you manage to afford a great team by the end of Fifa 18. But at the same time affording one of those players you listed, by grinding indefinetely, as of right now is possible even being f2p.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Meh, truth is we're jumping head over heels because the PL TOTS is all around insane, and except for maybe Pope every other player in this squad would find a spot on an average team so pretty much most people I know found something to keep in the guaranteed builder. However when the other TOTS will come out, Serie A, Liga, Bundes and Ligue 1, most people will end up finding cards they're simply not gonna use. Plus, they're giving us so so so many TOTS this year, three from WO already, three from the DKT, so end of the day I'd rather not hold on to my Criscito for it to get all dusty and just chuck him in the SBC to get one of the best, cheapest super subs out there.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I don't know if you've ever played Dokkan Battle, but instead of packs with every player they have "banners" or categories of packs. This could be done in Fifa, eliminating normal packs and having, for example, an "Argentine UEFA Banner" where you can only get european players from Argentina, with a featured section of 10 cards (usually one good card, two decent cards and the rest are pretty shit) and an unfeatured section with every other argentinian player. So using this example, the banner would have Messi as the banner card at a 1% pull rate, Otamendi Dybala Higuain Di Maria Aguero Lanzini Gomez Biglia Fazio also each at a 1% pull rate, and a 90% rate of pulling any other Argentine playing in europe. So for example, it's true that you'd be tightening the pool, but at the same time you'd keep buying packs just to get Messi, cause the rest is pretty bad. Plus, they could add LRs like in Dokkan with Icons, so in the Argentine banner you'd have like a 0.3 chance of pulling Crespo or Maradona. And this can be done with IF banners, TOTS and TOTY, MOTM etc. So you can see the % of pulling each player in the banner.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>So in my group of friends I'm considered the best fk taker, in last years fifa with an 85+ stat kicker I'd score most of them, whereas this year you could shoot in the same position with the same power ten times and get different results every time. There was a week right after the patch where freekicks went back to being consistent and all of my friends noticed as well, going from scoring 1-3 in 10 to 7+ in 10. So except for the buff that week freekicks are normally pretty random.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I think the word "magic" is used because nanotech of that proportion is thousands of years away. I'm not saying we have the technology to create the Iron Man suit seen in the first movie right now, but the broad concepts behind it (propulsors, rockets, machine guns, holographic HUD, etc.) are somewhat tangible. The only "missing" thing is a reactor as powerful and small as the one in Tonys chest. But again, that "looks" (literally, on the screen) more believable to an average viewer than nanotech assembling instantenously at will to form a cannon.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Wait I agree completely but I think you're confusing fans woth average movie goers. Like of course I'm a marvel fan and if I'm willing to believe that Thanos spoke to a floating Red Skull, threw his adoptive green daughter down a cliff to obtain a stone he then places in a golden gauntlet making him super powerful I'm also willing to believe Tony made a scientific breakthrough. But people who go see the movie cause they enjoy the franchise from a distance will be like "that kind of technology looks like magic ugh" and I can't blame them cause at the end of the day they're not immersed in the movie universe and only compare what they see to real life examples. So Tonys nanotech in the MCU is super believable, whereas in the real world it would be revolutionary. Whereas his first suits, in the real world, would be an improvement but nowhere near groundbreaking.</TEXT>

Then as soon as the game begins I switch formation to 41212 and use him r-ST and Crespo L-ST with Dinho CAM, sometimes using Costa as CAM and Dinho as R-ST. I gave him Hawk (I think but I'm not super sure). Insane player, incredibly quick, 5 * skills and great shooting.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I just pulled Int LR SV and have been doing his event with two 70% leads (double str LR VB). It's super easy and I don't have to use any items. Sure, maybe EZA and Super Battle Road and maybe Boss Rush are getting harder for 120% leads, but most events in the game are insanely easy anyway. Plus it makes sense those cards get replaced by their newer counterparts, even though I could argue that in certain situations I'd rather use my rainbowed 100% Agl SV rather than the no-duped Phy one I just pulled cause the AGL one at least has extra crits and aa's whereas the standard 45% phy is sometimes lackluster.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I am going to clarify what I meant with a single comment that addresses all of the issues raised by you guys. My previous comment was referring to the OPs statement regarding "Unregular players", and not timed finishing in and of itself contributing to augmenting the skill gap. I was referring more to the OP when he argued Fifa should safeguard unregular players (as if it doesn't do that enough already). When it comes to timed finishing, there's certain flaws in your arguments. I would like to point out I'm exclusively talking about *first time timed finesses from outside of the box* as those seem to be the most effective and the least realistic, so don't take into consideration timed long shots or timed finesses with players already in control of the ball. So when it comes to these kinds of shots, personally I don't see how they are "broken". I agree that they are extremely unrealistic and make the game appear more random, but judging solely by personal experience, the only players to regularly pull off these shots once or more per game are pros. I've played every but one weekend league this year, and rarely did I encounter people spamming the combo, and never did I meat anyone particularly effective at it. I'm a big fan of the franchise as a whole, but I'm also one of its biggest critics when it comes to gameplay, but I enjoy regularly watching pros going at it. And therefore, watching Prinsipe or DhTekkz (did you guys know he recently turned 17?) I see them scoring insane bangers with this, so obviously I try to replicate it. You want to know my results at it? I have a hard time getting in position for the shot itself, so I barely manage those kinds of combinations per game, and even when I get the pass timed just right I need to time the impact of the second shot just right. It's not uncommon to hit red or yellow, so that's still not incredibly easy, and only the more careful and dedicated users will master it. So lets say you hit a green timed finesse combo; for the player to score that first-time timed finesse I have to get lucky they're on their good foot; you wouldn't be able to count how many of these shots my IF Mbappe sent to Mars with his left foot. If you watch pros of course you'd think its a broken combo, cause they are the best at creating these situations, they're the best at timing these shots, and of course have the best icons which are suited for the job, but that sh*t won't work with everything for everyone, trust me. I'm a gold 1 player so of course I'm not the best but I'm still slightly above average I'd say, and after 500 games I still have to meet a non-pro who has mastered this shot to the point where he can score two or more of these per game. Thing is, and this must come as no offense, as soon as people concede even one of these in a whole weekend league, they're gonna start bitching and whining about it, and that's the biggest issue with this game. If people complained less they'd keep this game more enjoyable, but constant complaining brings the Devs to edit gameplay every other week, making it always less enjoyable. Now I know most of my evidence is anecdotal, so don't get too rattled about it please. Thx and good luck this weekend.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I mean don't diss the poor guy, it was a long shot hail mary but I guess we all wished this was true. First off because Walker is far less OP than last year, and he's quite disappointing to say the least, albeit still the best in his position, so ofc one would wish for a new "best RB in the game"... Secondly because were TAA any good he'd allow far better hybrids with VVD being the third best Gold rare CB in the game. My team https://www.futbin.com/19/squad/2435852 featured Virgil on 8 chem, so suppose Trent was close to or better than Walker, I'd have been super happy. So go easy on the OP, I hope Trent gets a decent SIF to use as well.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Anecdotal evidence, I fear, can hardly be called evidence at all. You cannot cite your experience as proof, because it's quite subjective. I'll give you an example; with a fairly cheap meta team costing less then a million featuring Son, Salah and Aubameyang as its best players, Andy Robertson and Davinson Sanchez being the worse, I reached Gold 2 fairly consistently getting very close to Gold 1 most of those times. Couple of weeks ago guaranteed IF packs showed up, got lucky and made 1.5 million pulling Mbappe and Hazard. I make a team with Neymar, 87 Crespo, IF Mbappe, Pogba, Ramos, Varane, IF Depay... etc. changing my squad mid weekend league. I was again getting close to Gold 1 before making the switch, but after the switch those last 10 games were a struggle; yet I made Gold 2 again. I thought I needed to get used to the team so I didn't worry. This weekend starting the full WL with this team I start off really really well, with an 11-4. I thought Gold 1 was near. The next 15 games were catastrophic, I barely won 5 of those 15 games left. Ended up short of Gold 2. And it's not that I don't click with this team, I actually play so much better with them. It's just that so many things are taken into factor with matchmaking and gameplay with these teams. Take into factor handicap, take into factor momentum shifts and scripted gameplay etc. Luck too. You may be the exception to the rule, but overall Gold 3 people with bad teams don't turn into Gorilla if you give them R9, trust me.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I reread Book 6 and 7 this past week, and I realized one thing. Despite Molly killing Bellatrix being a really monumental and cult scene in our childhoods, I would have loved for Bellatrix to die at the hands of... *Kreacher.* Honestly so many reasons why it would have been a much richer and more symbolic scene, and most are obvious, but I'll list them anyway. 1. First and foremost giving Kreachers presence in the final battle more meaning, a more specific and concrete contribution, since he wanted to avenge Master Regulus this would have given him a tangible hero moment. 2. For House elves in general. This would not have been Kreachers main motivation, but would have still been so inspiring for a House Elf to kill one of the main exponents of the "Wizard nazi party". Their filosophy being about "pure bloods" and anti-muggles. Imagine a house elf defying one of the strongest death eaters, and then killing her. 3. For Dobby. They were never friends, sure, but they did work together in tailing Malfoy in Half Blood Prince, and in general for Dobby to be avenged by another House Elf would have come full circle. 4. For Sirius. Sirius was still the last Black alive, and Kreachers last master. And Kreacher never sounds "happy" about Sirius being dead. Maybe his love for Regulus brings him to want to avenge the brother that looked so much like his master. And killing her, the treacherous woman that burnt off the last branch of the Black family tree, would definetely give great purpose to Kreacher. Point is, it would be cooler for Sirius to be avenged by Kreacher, since this would also signify redemption for Kreachers betrayal of Sirius in Order. 5. For Hermione. Tortured by Bellatrix for her blood status, a girl that always fought for House Elves with S.P.E.W etc., think about her face seeing a house elf finally in the spotlight, gaining the attention and admiration she always thought his race deserved. 6. For Harry. Harry has numerous times shown in the series how much he despises Bellatrix. She tortured Nevilles parents, she kills Sirius and Dobby, she tortures Hermione, she nearly kills Ginny. Since Kreacher is still "property" of Harry Potter at the time (supposing he was later freed) what better last act of subservience to Harry would it have been to be the extension of Harrys person and do what Harry longed for, which was for Bellatrix to suffer a dysmal fate? 7. When Bellatrix dies, Voldemort is profoundly shaken. He is seen halting his duel with Kingsley, Slughorn and McGonagall out of pure rage for losing his most faithful lieutenant. How cool would it have been for Voldemort to turn around and see the house elf he thought dead holding a replica of his horcrux around his neck? The creature he believed worthless and expendable fighting, beating, killing even his number one servant? The elven magic he always overlooked and underestimated and despised triumphing over the Dark magic he believed unbeatable?</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Despite the fact that there's actually a lot of evidence supporting the theory that scripting exists, 99% of it is anecdotal, with most of it consisting of people saying, "I was up 4-0 and then my players stopped playing". I trust people when they tell me this because I lived it on my own skin, but it's still weak evidence, being so unsubstantial. On the other hand there is a lot of hard evidence proving there is no scripting, most of it in the codes and in first hand testimonies from the devs. The right question that should be asked would regard pros and cons for EA to include momentum, script and handicap in their codes. How would EA benefit? The possibilities are endless. Selling Fifa points to addicted users who falsely believe an upgrade in their team ("If I had X instead of Y at right back I wouldn't have conceded that goal") would have changed the outcome. Being more friendly to casual users too. People who can't grind Rank 1 - Gold 1 and therefore have under 400k teams. How could they ever beat someone who has 5 icons and plays everyday? Handicap and momentum'll do the job. On the other hand, would they run into issues if these elements were discovered? What are the cons for them to include these mechanics in-game? I'd say none. Most of the people I know, most of the youtubers and most of the pros don't even doubt this fact, they take it for granted that the game presents these mechanics. Yet they never falter in playing the game despite the fact they would bet their lives on the existence of momentum. So what can you gain from this? That being *sure* about the presence of these mechanics is maybe going a bit too far, but surely don't blindly believe what EA tells you. It probably exists and is being impressively hidden, but never be sure about anything.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I played around 100 games with him. Decent pace, great shooting, great passing and surprising dribbling. Can only play CAM in a 4 2 3 1 (not RAM or LAM). I'd say, slap a hunter card on him and play him centrally and he'll do just fine. His outside the box shooting is great but his finishing is weak. His strength is absurdly inconsistent; he'll fend off Koulibaly and Ferdinand only to be robbed by Robertson or Azpilicueta. If you love the player you're gonna have a great time using him. If you just need a good icon that is a bit more versatile look elsewhere. If you need a good CAM icon he's great cost-efficiency wise.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Ok so the reason why I have an issue with time travel in movies is exactly portrayed in this movie. As soon as I saw it I believed it to be a great and untouchable movie but sitting back and thinking about it, I realized how many plotholes time travel generates. It seems to me as rather than choosing one "time travel trope", Endgame incorporated all of them. Cap going back in the past and showing up old at Tony's funeral is a clear example of Novikov's self consistency principle (too lazy to explain it, look it up), but Tony snapping / killing the Thanos of 2014 and it not affecting their timeline is a clear example of the distinct diverging timeline trope. So whereas Cap staying in the past affects the current timeline, Thanos dying does not.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>So last year Zoey Saldana called the movie "Gauntlet". We later found out that wasn't true, but I think that at the time it was, and later changed. Watching Endgame it makes sense why they wanted to call it Avengers: Infinity Gauntlet; the word Gauntlet obviously means a medieval army glove, which is what they are trying to obtain, but it also means "ordeal", which is what they go through with the time heist. This definition in particular derives from the saying of "running the gauntlet", a military tradition of running through lines of soldiers while getting attacked, which is what our heroes do in the gauntlet relay race during the final battle. Thought it was a neat easter egg.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Imagine time as a rubber band. It does its best to keep its original form until it reaches its elastic limit; surpassing it leads to its rupture point. This is from my 10th grade physics class so take it with a grain of salt. Evidently Cap going back to lead a quiet life with Peggy was so insignificant that it just slightly pulled on the rubber band of time, deforming it maybe but not breaking it. Therefore he did not generate a new timeline but rather conformed to the current one, because the two distinct timelines (events up to Endgame and the one Cap returned to) were compatible in most; therefore they merged. This of course means that Cap, despite knowing the future course of events, willingly laid low (didn't stop JFKs assassination, or Howards, or didn't warn anybody about Thanos). Definetely a stretch but supposing all of this, it is possible that a quiet life with Peggy would have not affected the future significantly (again, this means that we don't account for the butterfly affect either). 2014 Thanos dying on the other hand was such a turning point in history that it split off the timeline, generating a second one. It was such a strong yank on the rubber band that it ripped it and created a different ramification. In theory, taking all of this as possible, as of right now, there's two distinct timelines, one in which Thanos disappeared in 2014 and the guardians may have formed and fought Ronan, but without Thanos and Nebula in the picture, and the second main one that we saw with Endgame. A third possible one may have formed with Loki disappearing but I suppose Cap stopped him when he went to return the Time and Mind stones back. So two timelines for sure, maybe more.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>But what if the story of the first 22 movies of the MCU isn't from the main timeline? What if this is Branch Timeline 5, and the events in that timeline played out similairly to the MT, meaning they fight Thanos and Tony dies, the only prerogatives to Steve showing up on that bench? What if Cap, going back to the 50s and living with Peggy was very careful with his actions, and his influence on that timeline was quite conservative. Maybe in the main timeline our heroes defeat Thanos in a slightly different way; maybe Thor dies along with Tony. Maybe Ant Man is a woman. Point is, nobody told you that old Steve originates from this timeline. People are castrated by the idea that Cap must have lived out his life in a different timeline from the main one shown in the MCU, and somehow traveled back to this "main timeline", not considering the idea that this timeline we see is not the original main one.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>This was my theory initially, but overall knowing Steve he would never stand by and be passive about injustice. So maybe he wouldn't stop Howard Starks assassination or save Bucky because otherwise he might interfere with Tony being Iron Man and ultimately saving the day, but I'm confident he would have warned them in 2017 about Thanos somehow. Maybe telling them not to send Nebula to Morag in 2014. My point is that the Avengers could have won in Endgame without Tony dying, so I'm sure Steve would have warned them, ultimately because it would have created an alternate timeline with a happy and well Tony, why not give it a shot?</TEXT>

    <TEXT>If they work in 'sagas' and then 'phases', I don't think Galactus or Doom will be the bad guys in the next Avengers movie. Firstly because it'll be a while before they focus on the newly acquired properties, treading lightly because both X-men and F4 have had recent movies. I don't believe anything before 2022 will regard the new franchises. I'd say phase 4 will regard the current Earth Avengers (especially Spider-man, Doctor Strange, Black Panther, Falcon, Ant Man {and the Wasp} and Scarlet Witch) coming to terms with the fact that they carry the responsibility of defending Earth now that all 6 og avengers have moved on in different ways (and I think it's already pretty evident with FFH and Spidey saying Earth needs a new Iron Man). All of those individual movies will culminate in a 'New Avengers' movie which will have the same vibe the original Avengers movie carries - with the Heroes building their chemistry and learning to work together against a more Earth bound threat. Maybe Hulk or Rhodey act as the Fury of the situation. The X men and the F4 will have solo movies later on that - in a similar fashion to how GOTG really established Thanos and the Stones (elements that were only introduced or hinted at in earlier movies) - establish new villains and new elements (like Galactus, Doom, Apocalypse) and only in the big, final, saga-wrapping movie a-la Endgame will we see them all team up. The MCU always works in a very organic manner; heroes are never just dropped in conveniently for the plot. The GOTG were slowly eased into the greater saga, so I guess that's what's gonna happen for the Fox franchises as well.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Premise being made that I side with those that didn't really understand the humour in this episode, I'm pretty convinced it's just an infinite number of layers of metahumour by the authors that I can't see rather than it being an objectively bad episode. I think (emphasis on the opinionated nature of my statement) that the implementation of dragons and slut themes is tied to the fact that Dungeons and Dragons has a partnership with Rick and Morty and Adult Swim, therefore I imagine the authors were pushed into implementing certain topics they clearly didn't want to include. Often Rick is a meta voice for Dan and Justin so it's reasonable to think that when he's so disillusioned with the idea of fantasy and dragons, it's actually their voice coming through. Even in presenting the episode it was all about "This one's the one where Morty gets a dragon" in the most half assed way possible. They might feel like sluts in having someone tell them what to write and in a way feel dirty, the same way Morty does, but since they have to do it they'd rather shift it to their own narrative. They're not happy with it but since it is what it is they do it with that "in-your-face" attitude. I'm lost on the cat though. But hey, itXs just a theory</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Ok so bear with me a second; the Fut community can be summarized in three general socio economic layers; 1. The upper elite class, made up of Youtubers, Pros, and people who spend  #8364;1000+ a year on the game. 2. The middle-lower working class, meaning people that either do buy some Fifa points around TOTY but where their spending is nowhere near enough to tilt the balance of the game, or people who spend no money at all but play every weekend league and achieve Gold 1 ish rewards along with Div 3/4 Rank II rewards each week. 3. The casuals, the ones that can only play the game two/three times a week, that barely have the time to play Weekend League, or that are just not good enough and don't get decent rewards. Tier 1 obviously has no need for swaps; they sit on so much money (teams over 5 mil) that the grind for swaps is just not worth it. The cards are nowhere good enough for them to go out of their way trying to get them. Why would I grind 23 tokens for Essien when I'm sitting on 5 mil to buy 90 Gullit? The cards are nowhere good enough to warrant that grind. Tier 2 is where most of us belong. This class comprises all of my friends as well as myself and most redditors, and constitutes the core of the game. These are the players EA should cater to. We are the players that have the time, the energy, the love of the game as well as the necessity to grind free icons, because despite how much time we put into the game even baby Eusebio is just a dream for most of us. Is the swap system better than last year's for this group of users? Hell no. The quality of the icons is piss poor, nowhere near what we could afford through SBCs last year around the same period of time. They're all pretty mediocre, none of them are endgame and the few that are warrant a disproportionate amount of effort and time. Why should I grind 23 tokens for baby Vieira when futmas Sissoko cost me less than 200 k through his SBC? Last year you could aspire to get pro level icons through SBCs thanks to icon crafting. Sure, you couldn't get all of them but if you really loved Eusebio or Cruyff you knew you could at least grind his SBC, grind upgrades, take untradeable rewards in Rivals. Now those cards are unaffordable, and instead the top you can aspire to is mid ADP or baby Dinho. Tier 3 is of course casuals or players with little time or ability. Keep that in mind cause I'm going to come back to that in a second. Why was the swaps system implemented? The "official" version was simple: making icons affordable for everybody. Well, lets analyze it tier by tier. Tier 3, guess what; not only is the swaps system non affordable for casuals (which as I said not only would they need first owner cards, which they don't have nearly enough of, but they'd have to win games in Rivals, where they don't have nearly enough skill, or Squad Battles, which they don't have enough time for). I'm also gonna add, some friends who joined Fifa 19 late last year, who only played FOUR weekend leagues, and by may could still boast moments Bergkamp AND moments Desailly by completeing their SBCs. That's something that's almost impossible now for someone buying Fifa today. Tier 2; good icons are now LESS affordable. If I want Cruyff I need coins, because best case scenario his swap (most likely his baby version) will become available in May. So if I want his baby version I'm gonna probably have to wait for May, whereas last year through saving and grinding I got his Prime Moment SBC done in the first week of April. Tier 1; again, why would they do swap challenges when they can buy that card on the market? Do you see Castro, or MattHDgamer, or Pros like Tekkz or semi ex pros like Kurt doing swaps??? Now the core of the question; why then, why did they implement swaps and take away SBCs? It's obvious isn't it, it was costing them money. Fifa 19, despite being one of the worst gameplay wise, was arguably the best content wise. It allowed players to icon craft, avoiding buying Fifa points. Through the sbc system a player with NO real money spending on the game and decent results in weekend league (Gold 1) could afford to complete Eusebio and Vieira like my friend, or prime Ronaldinho and moments Cruyff like myself. It was a great way because that meant grinding, but a healthy grind, a grind that was worth it. This new grind is unhealthy and sick; it incentivizes keeping cards rather than selling them ("I better not sell this Griezmann, he might come in handy for LaLiga first owner challenges"), stalling the economy, but even worse it incentivizes buying Fifa Points, cause guess what, cards out of packs are first owner items. This was a really long comment but that -5 didn't sit well with me so I had to explain myself. Tl;dr icon swaps are the umpteenth time EA pull a money grab to bump their revenue. The SBC system was better and needed no fixing, and was removed solely because it cost them money.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>There could be a traitor (probably is) either amongst the heroes or class 1-A. The idea first came up when the LoV attack the class during the Forest Training Camp arc. The teachers discuss the possibility of a villain since the class was easily discovered by the villains. Later on AfO appears at the Nomu lab despite the fact that the League was surprised by the police raid, which brings many to think that a possible traitor reports to him and not Shigaraki. Another moment that's not really mentioned is iirc when the police raid Chisaki's compound but he's already on the run, which means they were also preemptively warned. Some people theorize it's Kaminari but I still don't get why, maybe cause I just watch the anime.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I found him (untradeable gold upgrade yeah I know MAD) and tbh he's good-ish. I replaced my Futmas Sissoko with him playing him CM with a shadow card in a flat 442 near walmart Gullit. My play-style tries to be an emulation of the maltese GOAT (free my boy Kurt) so I push Gullit forward while my other CM, Marcelo, is on Stay back while attacking, so even though it's a 442 it plays as a 41212. Sorry for the boring premise but if you're gonna play him CDM in a 4231 it's going to be a very different experience compared to mine so I wanted to give you a heads up in case my opinion could be useless. So; compared to Sissoko he's almost on par defensively but nowhere even in the same ballpark as strong physically. He's A LOT faster (obviously) and much better on the ball though, so once you win the ball back the transition for the counterattack is quick, smooth and fluid. He's also a better dribbler and better passer than Sissoko. I still think he's better in the other CM position, with less responsibilities defensively and more attacking freedom, but I can't change Gullit, even the Walmart version. As a pure CDM he sometimes struggles to outmuscle opponents, and he's only 174 cm which is a nuisance sometimes. Overall I'm happy because I'd rather risk the defensive issues and have another asset offensively, plus the 5* skills are fun for me cause I tend to skill a bit, but if you already struggle defensively and need a purebred CDM I'd go with David Luiz SS if you manage to fit him with chem. I tried his card and he's insane in that position. He's a juiced up Sissoko. Wins everything and is all over the place. Seeing as you played Kroos though I think Marcelo might be a very strong upgrade, they're similar but Marcelo is better in almost everything. Keep Partey though.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>And not just that, but even taking those aspects out, if Bakugo really thought he was perfect he wouldn't work as hard to surpass All Might; if he really believed himself to be perfect he would feel stronger than All Might already. Bakugo is a really noble character in a twisted way. His quirk is good, maybe great, but what he does with it is amazing. He works extremely hard because he knows he can be the best; he doesn't think that he's perfect, but he tries to be. I'd also add that even though western culture avoids recognizing it in media, personal attachments to people, friends and lovers, are sometimes an obstacle. Bakugo doesn't want people getting in his way. He doesn't want to lose friends on the battlefield, he doesn't want to be distracted by loved ones, etc. I think he would want to be the one protecting and saving people so bad that he even hates being protected and saved. And look, even though All Might is a nice guy he shut everybody out too, from Sir Nighteye to Gran Torino to David Shield. Endeavor did it in an even worse way with his family. Nana Shimura did it with her son too. I think the message Horikoshi tries to convey is that being a hero is a solitary road, and Bakugo is the most aware of it.</TEXT>

But they are absolutely different, examples would be penalties and freekicks. Try to keep track of freekicks. Shoot 100 freekicks on rivals and 100 freekicks on champions and see for yourself how different it is.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>First off, Kirishima's relationship with Bakugo is a weird one. He's also abused by Bakugo but whereas others tend to give Katsuli space when he gets angry/abusive, Kirishima always just laughs it off. I think it must somewhat relate to his quirk; Kirishimas unbreakable and relentless, not only physically but mentally too. Plus, I think he's the only one seeing through Bakugos act. But never in the wholo series does Bakugo acknowledge him as a friend. Bakugo does respect Kirishima the most, and that relationship is arguably the one that's gonna affect Bakugo the most during the series. Secondly, stop acting as if it's the first antihero you've ever seen in media. He's a cool character and gives depth to the society. Some want to be the number 1 hero to help people, like All Might and Izuku, some want to be number 1 because of pettiness, like Endeavor no longer wanting to be number 2 and Shoto to surpass his father. Hell, some want to be heroes just to have a harem like Mineta lol. And finally some want to be number 1 for the sake of being number 1, that's it. And Bakugo, because he knows how relationships get in the way, people get in the way, just pushes everyone away to reach his goal, but even then there are moments where he is a decent human being. Bakugo isn't a villain, at most he's an antihero, but to me he's a hero with a lot of depth and growth over the series; there's a lot of interesting aspects that sometimes make him more entertaining than Izuku and his sometimes cliche bland motivations.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Premises being made that you're extremely standoffish for no reason lol, and also that Bakugo doesn't need to say it for the author to intend it, as actions are a much better form of literary exposition than words; an example is when he's kidnapped by the LoV he explicitly tells Deku not to come save him. Obviously you're gonna see it as pride or him being a dick somehow cause #hateonKacchan2020 but to me he doesn't want Deku or anybody getting hurt saving him. And again when he gets saved by grabbing Kirishimas hand I imagine you're going to argue that he's friends with Kirishima and that's why he did it, but I think he was happy his "friends" came for him in the end even though he was scared for them.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I think it also relates to Horikoshi growing as a writer. In the beginning his characters were too extreme and radical; Bakugo was borderline psychopathic and sadistic, Izuku could have replaced Mother Theresa for how excessively nice and idealistic he was to everyone all the time. Whereas now, especially in the manga, Deku is growing more competitive to a healthy degree, and Bakugo is more of a loner than an outright dick (his insults are much lighter and used as comic relief than his initial downright abusive ways of speaking to people). They're never going to meet in the middle, Bakugo is always gonna be much more self centered than Deku and Deku is always going to put others before himself, but the former is warming up to his classmates' presence and the latter finally stopped crying when people looked at him wrong, so I guess it's a nice developing dynamic. And honestly who's shining through this is Shoto; he's apathetic and minds his own business most of the time like Bakugo but is still super polite to everyone without ever being mean gratuitiously, and he makes it his mission to unselfishly save people without being cheesy or corny like Deku.</TEXT>

    <TEXT> gt;so its a headcanon. My guy why are you so stuck up with this headcanon bs. If a character behaves in a certain way, his actions are meant to be interpreted deeper than face value. Literally every english class I took in my life was analyzing the deeper meanings of words. Why can't you go deeper than what he does to why he does it? Do you think Horikoshi would write up a lot of differently motivated conflicted characters, like Endeavor, Shoto (their family issues), Deku (his desire to save people came from the sense of inadequacy he felt when quirkless), Ochaco (poverty), Iida (responsability), and then go ahead and write up a central character like Bakugo who's only role is to be a two dimensional dick? Of course there must be deeper motivations to be explored. To be interpreted ffs.  gt;Bakugou challenges Midoriya for their second fight And the only reason he did was to self punish himself for the guilt he felt over All Mights loss of his powers. He felt like he was the end of the symbol of peace. He thought it was his fault All Might lost his powers. That alone is an example of his depth. If he was so self centered as you love to describe him, if his view of the world was so Darwinian where the survival of the fittest prevailed, a dog-eat-dog world, he would have shrugged it off as "All Mights weaker than I thought, meh". Instead he actually feels guilty and troubled about the whole ordeal because there's a part of him that cares much more than how you make him out to be.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Yeah my MF rn is Marcelo SS-Gullit baby both untradeable in a 442. I tried Luiz on loan and he was amazing as a "stay back while attacking" CM while Gullit played with less restrictions to join the attack. When I found Marcelo I was happy but bummed at the same time cause I'm forced to play him as the "stay back" CM. He's good in that position but he shines more in Gullits since defensively he's somewhat limited. I was happy but at the same time bummed it was Marcelo and not Luiz since I would have liked him more in that position. [My team.](http://imgur.com/gallery/LmGQ3E9)</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Like the last two Avengers movies lol. I know it's a lot of fanservice but it'd be really fun. First I'd want them to lose this battle. All the heroes lose and some villains like Dabi have their arc closed with this fight. Maybe Dabi fights Enji and something happens idk. Deku loses his 1 v 1 with Shigaraki, All Might dies saving Deku from Shigaraki, Stain randomly appears and buys Deku time to run away while he fights to avenge All Might and dies as well, redeeming himself maybe? Class 1-A regroups, some stuff happens, they deal with their failure to save All Might, and the last battle is brought on. Shoto, Kacchan and Deku fighting Shigaraki, each one having his moment. They lose again, but a deus ex machina like Captain Marvel joins them (maybe Mirio with regained powers jumps in), Deku throws the last punch and knocks out Shigaraki. The end.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Despite the fact that this is a good theory and a nice twist, I think Hori leans towards a "anybody, even someone born without powers, can be a hero" avoiding the destiny bs etc. The point is anybody can be exceptional, even those born ordinary, so Deku born with amazing mad powers kinda defeats the purpose and drags BNHA into the "this was my destiny all along" territory that in the history of shonens got boring quick.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I don't disagree with what you say but it still would give Deku a central role in AfOs story, something I'd dislike. Deku is a nobody that through who he is as a person, and not as a hero, is granted awesome power; having held a very strong power before the beginning of the story 'qualifies' him in a way I don't think we need. Up to now I wasn't disappointed with Hori's storytelling so all in all if he decides to go that way I'm sure it won't stick out as a sore thumb and it will be able to add a new layer to the story without falling into dumb cliches. So I'm not against it at all and wouldn't be mad if he adds that layer, and I'd even be excited to see that story told, but as of right now I think he's going in the quirkless direction.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Well tbh Deku is never really a chosen one-esque kind of character.  gt;!It's stated over and over how All Might, despite going from quirkless to OfA user, didn't have any issues learning or adapting to the quirk. He didn't break any bones and he fairly quickly became the symbol of peace. Mirio is another example of a character who is implied to be better suited for the power. But the point is Deku through sheer power of will, hard headedness and perseverance will become the strongest hero of all time despite the fact that he's starting the race way behind others. He is chosen in the sense that All Might sees in him hero material without the powers, and this in a way serves as an example to the viewers that anybody can be a hero.! lt; If you drop a chosen one storyline all it does is dilute that message imo.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Nah, it stresses really hard how many times Michael crossed the line in trying to push his teammates. It portrays him as an asshole, whereas the vibe before this documentary was that Mike was "hard" on his teammates. In this doc we not only hear people calling him an asshole, or direct recounts of him being an asshole, but we see moments (like with Jerry or Scott Burrell) where Michael straight-out bullies them. I entered this doc believing Michael was a tough-but-fair teammate they got to love because at the end of the day they would get better and win, but what I got from it is that Mike was a bully (and sometimes still is) that probably scarred half his teammates, and some like Scottie achieved the status to say "Hey, it was worth it" whereas others aren't so happy about it. And I mean Michael Jordan isn't Hitler, what's the most dirt you can even find on him? Is it so hard to believe he's a flawed but surely not evil person?</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I find your comment a welcome breath of fresh air just by how nice and polite it is, I'm not used to it on the internet right now, cheers. Anyway, yeah, shonens are formulaic, it's basically in the definition of what makes them shonens. The point is bnha wasn't always a standard shonen, that's what got me into reading it (the same way I imagine it hooked you). It thrives on pioneering certain things in this genre; "My Villain Academia", for example, or the protagonist not being that OP compared to other run-of-the-mill shonens. These are a couple of examples of territories no other shonen manga explored before. Power scaling isn't of itself bad, the issue with it is when it isn't organic. Shiggy in MVA was organic, and to a certain extent his latest "update" is too, but its justified for people to fear what might happen now. To imagine Deku (or hypothetically Endeavor) having a similar power up would be too much of a deus ex machina and make this manga too similair to a DBZ of sorts. I fear what will happen is someone is going to die, triggering Deku into getting a big power up in proportion to Shiggys but honestly that would be inorganic; Deku has slowly progressed into a stronger more confident hero, even discovering new powers. He had instances of brilliance like vs. Overhaul, but even then it was for a short instance and with help from Eri. What would be organic is for him to grow at his pace, not to have a surprisingly-well-timed unsolicited random 'awakening'. I have a feeling though that Horikoshi won't necessarily go in that direction, but will add a plot twist that makes either the villains win (a-la Infinity War/Empire Strikes Back ending), or Shigaraki fucking it up for himself rather than outright losing. Tl;dr: I don't think people have issues with what's happening now, but have issues with what might happen at the end of the path Horikoshi is currently taking us.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>It takes a lot of movie tropes from western literature, like the whole superhero theme. Also until now it didn't really see Deku just receiving a power up every time he needed it out of sheer coincidence the same way for example Goku would. Also, Deku is the obvious protagonist but until now it's not like he's left everyone else behind in terms of powers and abilities, despite the fact that his potential is way higher. Deku loses more times than I can remember and when he wins he wins at an enormous cost physically. Another thing that separates it from a Naruto or a DBZ is that there is no predestination to Dekus story. He isn't born a chosen one, and only his actions define who he is along the story. He earns All Mights respect and thus his power, he is born as powerless as can be. And when he gets his powers which in theory are supposed to be the best he is miles behind his classmates. Another thing I noticed is that the story of itself is way more fleshed out, less formulaic. It has a really big main cast; not just heroes, but villains too, and they aren't your run of the mill bad guys that just want power. They have character development, whereas in the few other shonens I can think of villains are usually two dimensional plot devices. By this I'm not saying bnha is a superior product, cause tbh I like my fair share of fanservice and you don't really get shit like Gogeta or Vegito here, and I really enjoy that stuff. But at the same time it makes it less predictable, making it a completely different experience that after years of the same stuff is a nice change of pace.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>This is the first time I play a 2k game since I've never been into basketball this much. I liked the sport, I always knew who won and the best players and watched some big games and dunk contests and the finals but being from Italy I always preferred football (or soccer as you call it) and would always play Fifa except for the odd free 2k game on the store in late July. With that  #8364;5 promo that came out around May I bought the game and I found it light years ahead of Fifa. You guys are incredibly lucky compared to us. I never really played basketball that much so I know I'll never fully understand how the gameplay behaves compared to real life but it's still 400 times more realistic than Fifa. The rosters are so much deeper when it comes to legends with 2k having basically almost every half decent player that played in the NBA except for the occasional Barkley or Miller. MyCareer cant even be compared to Fifas piss poor take of a career mode, don't even get me started; first of all it's so much more than a career because of the neighborhood features, allowing you to play classic career in the NBA, a "pro clubs" fac simile in pro am and a cool quick match with REC. Second of all you get to actually customize your player, you not only get to buy clothes and shoes and tattoos and emotes and jumpshots but have a shoe creator from scratch, whereas FIFA doesn't even allow you to customize beyond hair and facial features (but nowhere near as much as on 2k). MyTeam lacks competitive modes but is still incredibly fun albeit a cash grab, and reward players you can get by playing are SO much better than the Fifa ones. I mentioned gameplay, but beyond just how realistic it is there's nowhere near as many cheeses abused like in FIFA. I could go on, there's pretty much nothing Fifa does better except maybe Fut Champions, but if you feel like comparing I can add more examples. I know basketball is a smaller sport with only 30 teams compared to FIFA that has around 600, but I'd rather have a game that's dedicated to the top 8 leagues in Europe rather than have so much depth that dilutes the quality. So honestly don't complain as much, I for one will be buying 2k21 to disintoxicate myself from years of Fifa. 2k is a game that is flawed but its still probably the best sports game on the market rn.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Exactly! You can't hold the game to your unrealistic standard; the standard is set by every other game in the industry. You're out here complaining that hairstyles/hairlines are glitchy (?) meanwhile Fifa is a cashgrab that has only one mode (FUT) that is extremely poorly taken care of. You complain about AI? Have you ever seen what De Ridder or Schulz or Genereux do on pro clubs every day? Sit back and be thankful of what you have while we're out here begging EA to give us a decent game. Again, 2k is flawed, but realize it's nowhere near as bad as other games.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Every sports game ties its core mechanics to in-game currency, but in no game you can grind that currency like in 2k. An example would be the following: MyTeam 10 boxes cost around 100k vc right? In MyCareer an average player will make 100k vc in around 30-40-ish NBA games with incentives and endorsements and whatnot. Compare that to Fifa, where Fifa points can only be bought with real life currency. You could use the coins you use on the market (like NBAs MT), but its gonna take around 90 games for an average player to make 100k coins for a pack. And don't get me started on the packweight cause its not even funny how ridicolously Fifa packs yield compared to 2k. And how can you talk about microtransactions when in a mode like MyTeam they're not even as necessary, since in theory you could PLAY to get GOAT Kobe, GOAT Bird and Hakeem.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Because the MVP is assigned to the best player of the 82 games that compose the regular season (which tbh is something that kind of baffles me as well). So Nash won the MVP twice in 06 and 07 for his regular season contribution but he never even got past conference finals in the post seasons. And there is an argument to be made one of those MVPs was more deserved by Kobe.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Terry Crews tried agreeing with you and he's getting canceled lmao. Reading your comment I can break it down in two points, the first being you taking up an issue with the silence of the political lib-left not distancing itself from these people, and the second with people like Iverson or Stephen Jackson and their relationship with the BLM movement. The first has a convoluted explanation. Today people put all of their focus on one goal at a time - or all of their eggs in one basket if you want to use a metaphor. It's as if today's society has an acute form of ADHD that they can't focus on more than one cause, and what happens with that is that they become blinded by a dogma. People don't form opinions anymore, they side with a generic ideal and allow the exponents advocating for that ideal to shape their opinion. Basically because of goddamn laziness people allow other people to think for themselves. People in the US since George Floyds tragic murder seem to have developed the idea that the African American struggle and police brutality are all of a sudden the number one most important issue. Fuck Covid, fuck the crippling poverty disparity that is at the base of racial injustice, fuck the lack of health care, fuck the failing education system, fuck the gender wage gap and sexism in general and the whole caravan of injustice agaibst women for centuries, fuck the opioid epidemic, fuck the LGBTQ+ struggle, fuck gun control, fuck foreign policy, fuck everything, drop everything that you're doing and get to chant for the defunding of the police (these are just the tip of the iceberg, the US is a fucked country, I'm sorry but I'll say what every European is thinking). There are so many blatant issues but now the most important one is this one, so a guy can be homophobic, sexist and antisemitic as long as he's not racist against african americans. I support BLM, I believe one should be antiracist, but I'm not as myopic as certain people that blatantly ignore other issues. An example of this would be the central park Karen incident a couple of weeks ago; the narrative imposed by the media and people in general was "racist white woman uses her privilege to call police on innocent black man". And yet, had it happened in the midst of the me too movement where the rave was female empowerment and not the George Floyd protests, the narrative would have been "Man uses his male privilege to threaten an innocent woman in the park". What transpired that day lives somewhere in the middle; that woman was wrong for calling the police but that man was covertly threatening her and him being a male allowed for that to happen. That woman completely freaked out and was pretty scared in that situation, and honestly I don't blame her. Alone in the park, you'd be scared if a man used the words "I'ma do something you won't like" - indipendent of the color of his skin. Her racism seeped when she used the police as a weapon, but you can't deny they were both (to different degrees of extent) in the wrong. So tl;dr the left won't take a stance to distance itself from racist black activists because right now the black struggle is the only issue that people care about and that'll bring in big votes come November. The second issue is of simpler explanation. BLM is doing mostly good, but since it has no actual coherent and cohesive positions on certain topics, certain people can end up appropriating and misconstruing the message. I still think black lives matter shouldn't be a movement; it should be a blanket statement everyone should agree with, like saying the sky is blue. To entertain the idea that it's an ideal or opinion, and not an irrefutable truth, empowers those that view it as something you can disagree with or object to (but I realize in todays world it had to be marketed in some outstanding way). But just because certain people like Stephen Jackson or AI say certain stuff and they gravitate around that movement shouldn't make you confuse the distinct situations arising. During the civil rights movement to support Dr. King didn't mean to support Malcolm and vice-versa. Just because the NOI or Louis Farrakhan or Allen Iverson want certain things doesn't mean BLM and those behind it with a pure heart and good intentions do too.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Cristiano Ronaldo is more of a Kobe with how much he's obsessed with being the best, it's really on another level. I would have said Jordan but MJ had this thing with winning rather being the best, so he was fine with other people taking important shots and having top players like Pip or Rodman with him. When the triangle was implemented his scoring went down but he didn't really care as long as he got to win. Kobe instead wanted to be the Alpha and struggled with Phil and Shaq the same way Ronaldo wants to constantly be the best in a primadonna fashion. And I'm not hating on either cause they were the best in their prime and have trophies to back it up. R9 Ronaldo is in a way similar to D Rose in the sense that he was the best for a short while but injuries slowed him down alot after a couple of great years. Iverson would be Ronaldinho in the sense that he was an incredibly entertaining fun player who had the efficiency to match that entertainment value but lacked the discipline to keep up that form. Stevie G is a bit of a Nowitzki in the sense that he stayed with one club and had his fair share of success but was way better than what his trophy cabinet can attest. Pele is easily comparable to Bill Russel. Both played ages ago in what could be considered a different sport, should be considered pioneers but are sometimes too hyped up because of how much they won. The extent of the Messi-Ronaldo rivalry can be associated to the Bird-Magic rivalry which made the sport entertaining again, and because of how they were on enemy teams and split the number of awards among them, but as players I don't see any similarities. Today I'd say Mbappe and Luka are similar in the sense that they are so young yet look so seasoned, and play like leaders and veterans. Zion burst in the scene as arrogantly and dominantly as Haland did, lets see if they keep it up. Giannis is so loveable and came out of nowhere that he reminds me of Ngolo Kante but he has a lot to win to show that. Lebron reminds me of Messi because of his nearly 20 year long dominance in the league and yet he's constantly questioned by haters bringing up stupid details like Lebron being 3-6 and Messi's lack of success with Argentina, as if they both weren't the best thing to happen to the sport in 20 years. This was cool, thanks for the read :)</TEXT>

    <TEXT>For the sake of it I'm going to go on an unconventional route lol. Playing on the 76ers I'd say they are similar to Arsenal because of years of ups and downs and success being now a long time ago. Last year Arsenal lost the EL final against Chelsea in similar heartbreaking fashion to how the 76ers lost against the Raptors. Embiid's lack of performance when it really counts is similar to P.E. Aubameyangs; they're both African icons, they're both amazing but always fall off in clutch moments. Simmons is young and amazing but has a glaring weakness in his 3-pt shot, similarly as to how Gabriel Martinelli is amazing in basically everything except passing.</TEXT>

By the end of the 1993 season no one had a doubt he was the GOAT, let alone after 1998. R9 in his prime was the best player in the world but still not up for GOAT debate, and taking only their primes I'd still take Maradona, Messi or CR7 over R9.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>If I were you I'd stay loyal to the Mavs. They stay an interesting team with great young talent and a strong Euro core that you might feel invested in with Luka, Kristaps and even Germany's own Maxi Kleber. If you feel more adventurous but still feel patriotic you might want to follow OKC where Dennis Schroder might end up grabbing 6th man of the year this season. It looks like the championship is a three way bout between the Bucks and whoever makes it out of LA, but the Covid stop might subvert the balance a bit so there's way more dark horses than usual. This season is a crazy one to get back in but it'll also be a very particular experience so cheers!</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Imo from what I've seen the only ones that could be up for debate are AI and T Mac. AI in his prime was the best player in the league, despite an ok team, a really poor work ethic and oh being barely 6 ft. If you transplant MJs mentality in AIs head he would have worked harder on the flaws in his game and would have been up for the GOAT debate. Better than MJ? I'm not sure, but he'd have some rings and some more MVPs to his name for sure. By the time MJ was 30 he was tearing up the Suns and winning his first three-peat. His insane work ethic allowed him to retire, play baseball for shits and giggles, come back and win a second three peat at 35 while still being the best player in the league. By the time AI was 30 he was playing in Denver and was already nearing the end of his career, and by 35 he was in Turkey nearing retirement. Imagine AI keeping up his 2001 form until at least 2007. Insane. T Mac was a taller bigger MJ with a 3 pointer. He lacked the discipline and the hustle in defense, and had he worked harder we would have seen less injuries and less flaws in his game. He could arguably do most things Mike did on offense, so he had the talent. He lacked that mentality and that makes him one of the biggest what ifs in the 2000s NBA. This said MJ didn't just have the mentality; he was a freak of nature with ginormous hands AND could jump 46 inches. He had feel for the ball and had a very delicate touch despite pizza pans for hands, and yet had the strength to run and dunk over bigger defenders. He was lethal from mid range and arguably could have been a decent 3 point shooter in todays more 3 oriented league. So to say AI and TMac may have been as talented, MAYBE. More talented, I don't think so.</TEXT>

    <TITLE>New custom jumpshot glitch?</TITLE>
    <DATE>2020-07-18 20:00:02</DATE>
    <TEXT>Ok so my two favourite jumpshot bases are 98 and zach lavine because of the way they set their feet with a couple of steps before shooting. I made my custom J (zach base, steph and larry 50/50) and for a while it worked splendidly, then one day my player stopped doing those jumpshots. It's not the old glitch where it changes the shot, on the my animations menu it's still the custom one, but when I shoot it's a different animation (I can tell from how he's standing compared to shuffling his feet before shooting and the follow through in the arm). I tried deleting the custom js, buying all the jumpshots and remaking the jumpshots over and over, buying all the jumpshots on my other characters, deleting and downloading the game again, but it simply won't work. I tried changing to other preset jumpshots but only some work (Zach and Curry won't work, but when I set Klay Thompson or DWade something changes in the upper but not the base since he keeps his feet planted). I tried searching the subreddit and I only found stuff on the old glitch so I'd love to hear if anyone has the same problem. Edit: clarified a point</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Evidence of this is how the Bulls struggled the season and a half without MJ. Scottie never rose to be the leader that was expected from him, and ultimately let the team down vs. the Knicks in 94. On the other side he was fundamental in MJs success. He was an amazing defender and was a good positive influence on the team that could balance Jordans assholeness. Pippen was never leader material and it showed; he will always be the best n. 2 player in history that probably would have never won anything as n. 1.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I saw this the other day and I'm skeptical. Like I'm sure it yields results but when he said "how come we have all this technology and players are getting more injured" he honestly lost me. There's no correlation between bicep curls and your ACLs; you can lift dumbells all you want over your head but if you land awkwardly on your ankle you're fucked either way; you can add iron on iron but what happens if your achilles snaps? And the argument that he trained the best so he's gotta be right is really stupid. Jordan needed that muscle to deal with Detroit in 1991, not to handle injuries. From 1981 to 1990 MJ had virtually no weightlifting training and the only injury he had was a broken foot. He had no relevant muscle injuries and was the best player in the league for 5 years. Then he got big. So yeah some more muscle definitely do help but Grover is overselling it by a lot.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Premise being that big strong quads still don't save you from most knee injuries (they actually expose you more) he also talks negatively about cable training, which is what most leg training focuses around (leg press etc.). He specifically says that traditional weights ("lifting iron") are the solution, so I guess when it comes to the lower body he only means squats or deadlifts. And there are way better excercises than those to teach yourself how not to get injured (and they all involve medicine balls and rubber bands, the things he hated on throughout the whole video). My point is, like everything, you need a balance.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I agree with many saying that in hindsight it's really easy to pick MJ over Hakeem, I'd counter by saying that even in hindsight nothing assures you MJ flourishes on the Rockets. If I were a Houston fan, and had the chance to redo everything picking MJ with no certainty of winning anything, or keeping Hakeem and his two rings, I'd go the safe route. Maybe history repeats itself and MJ bags 6, maybe he only bags 3, maybe he does worse than Hakeem and doesn't win anything and gets traded amidst frustration within the organization. Hakeem got them two rings and is in the pantheon of GOAT centers. I'd say Houston fans are ok with that.</TEXT>

We have the absolute certainty based off of the actual course of history that Hakeem was drafted first and won two rings. Can you say with the same objective certainty that Jordan on the Rockets wins more? Since nobody can reason off of "what if's" with absolute certainty, Rockets fans sit well with the idea of not drafting MJ in my opinion. Now Portland fans, that's a different story.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>No bro of course! It's hard to imagine a basketball player, a sport that requires a very particular, unique combination of physical traits, in another sporting context. I see Russ more as a fighter, as a boxer or mixed martial artist, because he's not too big and decently quick. However when it comes to soccer it's really hard to be as big as Russ is and still have a player like Robben's technical skills. CR7 is very unique in that sense, he's around 6'2, incredibly fast and incredibly technical. No player is that tall, fast and talented. Russ is 25 lbs heavier, around 7 cm taller, so even if he were as gifted technically he probably wouldn't be as agile and quick. Steve Nash on the other hand is the best example for a soccer player in the NBA. He was already playing when he was a kid and was pretty good at it, in a country where very few people play soccer. He's pretty tall too but much leaner than Russ, granting him more agility. He could have played as a CB or a decent midfielder if he had the right skills.</TEXT>

Were Olenna to be caught with the poison, she would foresake every Tyrell to ever live. The marriage would be off and half the family would be executed. With this plan, worse come to worse she'd be pinning it on Sansa. She doesn't necessarily want Sansa to take the blame but would rather Sansa do than her or her granddaughter. And since Sansa (in theory) should benefit from Jeoffreys death it only makes sense for her to play a part in it too, even unknowingly.

    <TEXT>In my opinion as readers we should avoid being anchored to cultural norms, western or westerosi. You can't deny there are characters that are very progressive, and others that are stubbornly conservative. When ethically or morally questioning fictional characters I tend to ask myself if that character found the right balance between naturally good and culturally appropriate. When I say naturally good I intend what scholars consider "natural law", intrinsic to human nature. Catelyn freeing Jaime, despite making emotionally sense, and despite being easy to empathize with, is overall the wrong choice, because it costs Robb the war. Robb marrying Jeyne is easily relateable, it's what any society without arranged marriages feels to be "normal", and yet it's a really bad decision, that also costs Robb the war. Ned killing a man for deserting is wrong through todays lens, and yet what else can he do? The wall is there for a reason, and needs to be manned for a reason. Cat is constantly questionable because when she does things the westerosi way, like her treatment of Jon, it's for nothing more than selfish reasons. And I'll grant that there are bastards with worse treatments, but there's also bastards with better treatments. And Ned treats Jon as a son in Cats eyes, and yet Ned is an honourable man, and Robb treats him like a brother, and he's her son. So why is she so hellbent on treating him this way? She is shown time and time again that another way is possible; yet she chooses to be stubborn and selfish. When she behaves like a mother would today, exchanging Jaime for Sansa and Arya, she still behaves stubbornly and selfishly. When Ned acts honourably, it is for the good of the realm; no good can come for him from pulling the rug on the parentage of the three incestuous spawn. And when he acts "dishonourably", lying to the whole kingdom about a certain bastard boy, this only attracts hate and resentment on his person, and yet he does it nonetheless, unselfishly.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Arya wearing Jaimes face after he dies somewhere makes the most sense thematically and story-wise (and because of that it'll never happen). Arya has had this list for a while and should at least cross off one big name herself. Jaime should die valiantly renouncing Cersei; the climax to his arc shouldn't be confronting her, because confronting her still means loving her. His arc should end by him turning his back on her and fighting someone elses battle.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>If you judge families based on two characters you could say the Boltons aren't worse than house Lannister. Tywin and Cersei and Joffrey were as evil and even more dangerous than Roose. The issue with writing POV literature seems to be that some characters appear nuanced, rich of depth and swimming in grey areas (Tyrion or Jaime) while others appear to be hastily characterized on just on one side of the spectrum (Tywin, Joffrey, Ramsay). Roose reminds me of a Bond villain, but not in a good way. Ramsay is quite literally a psychopath but at least he grew up in a bad place as a bastard which in turn explains his being the way he is. Joffrey on the other hand is evil for the sake of the plot.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>She killed Raff, the Tickler, and Polliver indirectly. If the series is right Meryn Trant is on the way too. But I feel with Jaimes prophecy and Arya's prayer that she should end up killing Cersei. I imagine a Jaime chapter with a battle in Kings Landing that ends in a cliffhanger followed by a Cersei chapter where she watches the fighting from her balcony ending Jaime walking into her room so the reader is like "Oh so he survived" only for him to start choking her and when Cersei claws his face she pulls Jaimes face off ending the chapter on her clawing for her life as a northern girl is smiling at her while choking her. The next chapter would be Arya walking out of the castle and in GRRM fashion recounting how she did it through a dazed flashback of finding Jaimes body, taking his face, and killing Cersei telling her who she is.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Why? It would be amazing! First of all she'd be killed by "her brother", respecting the prophecy in a way. She'd also allow "him" close to her, reflecting her arrogance; despite evrything she did she is adamant in her vanity. She feels like she can dispose of Jaime right and left and still could never do anything bad enough to make him stop loving her. So seeing him coming back doesn't raise any doubts, she'd see him as still in love with her. She could never realize or come to admit he stopped loving her. And then when in her dying moments she finds out it's Arya she would realize she's paying the consequences for everything she did from way back in the first book aka don't f- with House Stark.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I'm one of his biggest fans but you have to be honest and recognize he's not anymore. It's offensive when I read that he never was, I honestly don't take those people seriously. Players like him that rely strongly on physicality and explosiveness will regress with age, let alone an injury that happened a month ago. What made him an mvp caliber player was that raw physical power mixed with an iron will and determination; with age and injuries you lose the first, with arrogance and being stubborn the second becomes useless. He's still a great player and imo one of the best second choices a team in the NBA can offer, so I'd pin this L as much on Harden as on Russ.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>What I don't understand about this sub is that it seems to me that it's always the losing team that drops the ball, never recognizing the greatness of the winner. Sure Brodie played poorly a couple of games and Harden didn't carry as much as was expected, but you realize that the Lakers can sport the best player in the last 22 years in Lebron, the real DPOY in AD, experienced winners in Rondo, Green and McGee, good young players in Kuzma and Caruso. There's no "failure" in losing against the n 1 seed, arguably the best team, especially because they are still slated to win it all. It would have been shameful to lose against OKC (and they almost did), but I say a W against the Lakers would have been an upset, a big one too. Plus, the west this year got even tougher with both Los Angeles teams becoming contenders overnight. Also, this thread is flooded with CP3 mentions, as if the L is only pinnable on Westbrook. As if Chris would have singlehandedly changed the tide. Remind me how many championships did the Rockets win in the two years with Chris? Nevermind that, how many conference finals? Exactly.</TEXT>

But injuries happen more often when you get older with age, so I don't see my comment as controversial. He was an MVP caliber player and now he's not, that doesn't make him bad, it just means he should behave accordingly and not like he's the best ever cause frankly that's part of what's hindering his game.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I don't know what line of work you're in and I think it's offensive to presume shit so, talking strictly for myself, I agree I'd rather live in the bubble right now but; 1. I'm used to my current living arrangements and this 9 to 5 routine inside the house; got used to it way before CoVid. Being locked down isn't that much different from my life before the pandemic. NBA players are used to taking jets anywhere if they feel like eating in a different city. My idea of a crazy night out is a restaurant 5 minutes away. I can't lecture them since we're clearly on different levels. 2. NBA players in the bubble are uber observed wherever they go, uber tested every 5 minutes, don't have much privacy outside of their rooms. They have coaching staff, journalists, facility staff and opponent staff always around them. 3. What is expected of me is run of the mill, standard work. I'm not really talking about "phoning it in" but what is expected of me is fairly ordinary. I don't have 50 cameras on me, millions of people expecting me to be better than someone else, who in turn is expected to beat me by millions of other people too. I have no one actively trying to stop me from being successful, I don't have that kind of stress. If I do my best, I succeed. If Chris Paul does his best it might not be enough, and it wasn't. So yeah, OF COURSE athletes sign up for that level of stress and are adequately compensated for it. But when you put them in ordinary conditions and still expect the extraordinary from them it might be stressful. I know it sounds stupid and immoral but when an athlete is "spoiled" it's normal for them to be somewhat demanding. It's no surprise every big star is complaining whereas it's only rookies or smaller names that are chill rn. 4. They have millions of people telling them they should appreciate what they have and that must be irritating too. I saw Javale's vlogs and their food is very meh, coming from me, a 23 y/o kid. What do you think an NBA player with private chefs and money to buy the best food will think? 5. I can switch off. I can stop working at 6, relax, focus on other stuff, not thinking about work. They have free time too, sure. Pool, spa, massages, etc. But is it really free time when you run into Russel Westbrook in the elevator knowing full well the outcome of your season depends on a game against him in 12 hours? Is it really off time? Is it relaxing? Or even running into your coach? Imagine relaxing in front of the TV and your boss barges into your house and sits down next to you. To an extent that's what it must feel like. 6. At the end of the day its better to stop judging them. Cause in their shoes I'd be the same. If I lived like Bron for a year I'd never want to go back. There's many more points that could be added. I don't want to sound patronizing but I feel like it's too easy to call them out for this stuff and its much harder to sit down, try to walk ten feet in their shoes and reflect on the lives of these athletes and what they go through, positives and negatives.</TEXT>

Aegon treated the defeated lords with respect and allowed each region to retain its own laws and customs. The Targaryens in a way unified and brought peace. The different kingdoms before the conquest were separated and constantly at war. The Targaryen campaign was a unification of sorts.

    <TEXT>Bend the knee and embrace peace or keep warring the neighboring kingdoms? I wouldn't neccesarily call it an unjust war. What Aegon did can be seen as noble if you squint your eyes hard enough. Those people lost their lives in the conquest because their rulers preferred to keep living in a state of constant conflict. This conquest was a war to end all wars, you might argue it was inevitable. Plus nobody had birthright to all of Westeros when Aegon pranced in. On the contrary Robert killed the rightful heir and had every possible heir killed as well. Going back to the main point, I'm not sure if it's accurate for Stannis to claim the throne when Dany is alive and strong. You'd need to study a lot of succession law in Westeros to understand it.</TEXT>

I have a hard time believing that Stormfront, the last true German Nazi left, wants Homelander to spearhead the return of her ideals. And Homelander going along with it, being racist, also doesn't really make sense; he is so narcissistic he wouldn't even bother "classifying" human beings, it's him up the ladder and then way way down everybody else. I hope that by the end of it she's just using him and he's following her only for love/sex/approval and doesn't really care about any of that race stuff, because it would be very uncharacteristic of both of them if they became a Nazi power couple. Funny to note that if this turns into another nazi show, prime video will be the house of three big shows on fighting Nazis; Hunters, MitHC, and this one.</TEXT>

The Reich stood for the purity of the Aryan race. The Reich also strongly believed in ancient lore of predetermination.

    <TEXT>Reading this comment, with all respect, I seem to understand you either misunderstood what I was saying or I have poorly explained myself.  gt;If or if not das Reich would or would have not liked the US of A in the 1940ies is completely irrelevant to this specific Amazon prime show. I said I hope Stormfront is using Homelander instead of actually loving him, because imo it would be uncharacteristic for an *OG German* Nazi to love Homelander in any way. Her loving him *only* because of his strong powers and blonde hair would be very uncharacteristic of a German Nazi, because he still is an expression of American culture, something a Nazi would not really admire. *IF* this love dynamic is all a ploy by Stormfront to use Homelander to subjugate the US and bring them to kneel, in the process installing a very German fourth Reich, then it would be accurate and make sense. *If* she actually loves him, that's cheap writing. By this I'm not saying I'm missing the socio-political metaphors; on the contrary there's many, one being Homelander accepting his role in this "race war" simply to be powerful and feel useful, gaining some attention with it, something many white supremacists actually do. They don't really care about the ideal, it's about feeling part of something. But Stormfront is *literally* a Nazi, flags and Himmler and Goebbels and all. There's little space for metaphors when her character is this literal. You could argue their dynamic critiques how some americans (in this case Homelander) are allowing supremacist ideals in their country (him believing Stormfront) without really understanding the extent or the consequences out of ignorance and the need to feel part of something. Edit: this whole historic discussion literally got us nowhere. You focus too much on Nazi racial policies, I'm trying to say there's so much more to Nazi ideology and the Nazi endeavor in general than race.</TEXT>

In 2002 he was already flaunting a significant amount of curves. Kobe had an insane work ethic, his "mamba" mentality didn't allow him to be a meme as much as Shaq was. If they had set their egos aside it still would've been a tough coexistence considering how they approached their "job".</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I know this is extremely hypothetical and useless but for the sake of the game we're playing you have to imagine every last one of the 96 Bulls growing up in todays era, learning to play this kind of basketball. MJ today would be a great 3-pt shooter; not Klay or Steph but still very good. Rodman would learn to tone his violence down to not allow so many FTs. Ron Harper would become an even better perimeter defender. Scottie would also have worked much harder on his 3 ball. If you compare eras, GSW are taking each game with or without KD because, exactly how you correctly pointed out, they'd just be chucking the ball from midcourt highly confusing the Bulls. But that talent on the Bulls, growing up in todays game, is still scary af and a completely different scenario, and imo would beat a KD-less Dubs team. On the other hand KD makes it too unfair; imagine prime Hakeem joining the Bulls, that's basically what happened. Still wouldn't say a sweep, but Dubs take this one easy.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I don't get what's so big about the way they handled it. I'm from Italy and we were hit really hard by Covid, but when football (soccer) restarted there was no bubble. Teams would travel up and down the country and players lived their lives. No cases of Covid happened throughout the restart (June-August 2020). Players were justbreally careful with testing and masks and contact with other people and everyone was safe. Now the new season just began and unfortunately players laxed up on safety too much and new cases arose, but the summer period showed a bubble wasn't necessary to avoid new cases as long as everyone was careful. I'm not discrediting Silver, the bubble was a valorous, successful, and enormous effort, I'm just saying it might have been overkill and unnecessary.</TEXT>

It is partially true that MJ many times was stubborn but a.) it served him as a weapon in the sense that it worked, compared to Westbrooks hard headedness being his greatest weakness and b.) Mike adapted many times too, whereas Russ did not. Also helps that Mike cared abouy winning above all else, whereas Russ loves chasing empty stats sometimes.

They never won a championship so that doesn't help their legacy. Plus their biggest player at the time was Ewing, and he lacked the appeal other big men had like Hakeem or Shaq or even David Robinson. Their recent years were bad, with their best coming when Melo was around and he's a player everyone loves to hate. I don't think their somewhat ugly colors and brand identity ever helped their cause for casual fans. The only thing they have going for them is the fact that they're from NY, but now that the Nets are in Brooklyn I think they kinda lost that too. And yeah they were good in the 70s but nobody calls 70s NBA cool because that's basically a different sport.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>*1. A total loser without Pippen* I could argue Mikes numbers from 1984 to 1990 were still astonishing; numbers which, despite losing, still show just how dominant he was, but that would be useless. It's true, Mike never did win much with a shitty team of unprofessional cocaine snorting assholes. What I'll argue is that when Pip was the leader in 1994, with a great team, and the best coach ever, he showed what he was made of. Not only weren't his skills enough, he disappointed the team from a leadership standpoint. Compare that to LeBron who could count on D-Wade and AD on 3 of his 4 rings. Worth to note that MJ and Pip were the only two players on both three-peats. People love to say how Mikes teams got good only when Pip developed and yet never mention how important Mike was in his development. And anyway, you could argue the real gamechanger was Phil and the triangle, cause Pip and MJ + Doug Collins failed miserably. Also, LeBron is also a total loser without good teammates. He needed Bosh and Wade to win his first ring. He needed AD to win his 4th. And even without Kyrie his third is improbable. *2. Never once beat Larry Bird* April 20, 1986. Larry Bird on record saying "that was just God disguised as Michael Jordan" and "that's the greatest player ever". MJ didn't win that game but the person used in this example invalidates this second point. If Larry Bird is a benchmark for greatness, Larry Bird saying you're God at 23 must mean something. And I remind you, it's of a SOPHOMORE Michael Jordan. Imagine Luka Doncic playing so well Lebron is forced to say that this is the best player ever, adding it's God disguised as Luka. That was GOAT level shit from Mike considering he just got better since 1986. *3. Could never beat a Super Team* That is complete BS. Firstly because back then there were no such things as superteams, secondly because the closest thing to a superteam was the Jazz with two HOFers / Dream Team players and he handed their ass to them in 6. Twice. Back to back. *4. The East was terrible* Firstly, that's bullshit. MJ beat 5 different West teams in the finals, showing even if the East were to be easier, he still was better than the best the West had to offer. The thing about more than 1 Hall of Famer was really dumb. The 1991 Lakers and the 97-98 Jazz had 2 HOFers (but Mike still beat them), but the Blazers, the Suns and the Sonics all had 1 HOFer. The 94 Rockets had only Hakeem before adding Clyde the year later. Point is, even teams in the West didn't usually have more than 1 HOFer. And besides that, winning contributes to your HOF status. So of course if Penny had won he might be a HOFer right now, same goes for Horace Grant. Unfortunately, they were stopped in 96 by a man called Michael Jordan. *5. Everyone won rings on his watch* It's easy when you take his Wizards stint, but we all know those seasons have an asterisk when considering Jordans career. His rookie years are dumb too, considering how bad his team was. And Hakeem and Drexler are also dumb considering he played half a season after coming back from baseball. You can maybe hold the 87/88 Lakers and the 89-90 Pistons over his head. If you reason like he did everyone won rings on LeBrons watch; Duncan, Ginobili, Parker, Kawhi, Kobe, Gasol, Pierce, Rondo, Garnett, Nowitzki, Jason Kidd, D Wade, Shaq, Curry, Klay, Durant, Draymond, even the fucking Big Ben-Chauncey Billups Detroit Pistons. What a random fact to state to support LeBrons cause. Stephen A Smith said a smart thing yesterday: if I'm a hater for saying LeBron is number 2 keep calling me a hater, but I think you have your priorities wrong son.

    <TEXT>You're overrating Pippens value to Jordans career and underrating what Mike did for him instead. Mike was the best in the league before Pip finished his first season; rookie of the year, all-nba second team in 1985, 3 time all star, scoring champion, dpoy, steals leader and MVP in 88. All of this on shitty teams. On the other hand when Scottie was left to lead in 1994 he had the best coach and a strong number of good players, and yet he let the team down in many ways. You also don't consider Scotties development under Michael; LeBron got traded to the Heat who were already insane. The Bulls draft Scottie and slowly develop him. It's very different.</TEXT>

That Warriors team is considered the best there ever was, not the best there ever could be lmao. Secondly, Magic was 31 and still in his prime in 1991 when he faced MJ in the finals, he just came off of an MVP in 1990, averaging 20/7/13. Thirdly, Shaq was 24 and well in his prime in 96 when he faced MJ in the ECF, he averaged 27/11/3 and had just come off a scoring title. I wonder if you look shit up before you say this stuff. It's true that MJ never faced anyone as good as the 2017 and 2018 Warriors, but he did beat teams that were better than the 2015 Dubs, the 2011 Mavs, and the 2007  amp; 2014 Spurs.

    <TEXT>Are you saying Magic is overrated? Cause honestly you'd lose me right there. Magic is the consensus best PG all time, even though he might be surpassed by Steph one day. The thing about the evolution of the league, of course the game has evolved. That's obvious! Players are getting bigger, faster, stronger, the game is less sectorialized (big men shoot 3s, little men drive and dunk). Injuries are treated better. We're shifting to positionless ball, or at least a redefinition of positions. It's necessary evolution and it doesn't surprise me. But what does that have to do with anything? I'm missing the part where big men shooting threes = LeBrons better than MJ.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I love Letitia Wright as a sidekick, but I think she lacks the acting experience and in general the persona to carry the franchise on her back. I'm not against the idea of having a female BP but I think the right choice is Lupita Nyongo, since it makes sense not just from a business standpoint but from a narrative standpoint too. I loved the serious Tchalla-joking Shuri dynamic, and that would still work with Nakia as a protagonist. She has the field experience to be BP and she would actually be queen if she married Tchalla in this off time (could be retconned I guess). That being said, when an actor dies in a big franchise it's really hard to work around it; in the Fast franchise they did a great job when Paul Walker died, but being mid-production it was also easier. To explain T'challas disappearance they'd need to either kill him offscreen, which is a huge copout and is completely unsatisfying, or justify his departure offscreen, which would be unrealistic considering he just became king and barely had any adventures. That's why I'm not against the unfortunate idea of recasting him, keeping the franchise with T'challa. T'challa as a character is too important to Marvel to be eliminated so soon. Having appeared in just 4 movies, with two of them having barely any screen time and lines, and just one as a protagonist, I don't feel like it's too late.</TEXT>
