    <TITLE>Anno 1800: Bad ship movement and slower overall gameplay compared to the old Annos. Any thoughts about it?</TITLE>
    <DATE>2019-04-16 22:22:49</DATE>
    <TEXT>So something off topic first: im a really big fan of anno since 1602. A lot of people have been complaining that there is no land combat. I don #8217;t really mind it, I think it wouldn #8217;t fit with the slow paced gameplay. With this said, it #8217;s even more important to have a fun experience with naval combat. So about the topic: do you guys think the naval combat is good? I found that the ships often go on weird routes and sometimes chase someone for a very long time in defensive mode. Or they (not that often) sail into an island and then go around it. What bothers me the most is that it takes literally ages for the ship to turn, especially against the wind, which I understand but this slow! I don #8217;t like doing war anymore cause there #8217;s no strategy involved anymore.once your in a fight against an Harbour your ship stays there cause of the slowness when under attack. And combined with the slow turning it #8217;s just about the firepower and sustain. Though I like the design with the wind. It feels really good to sail with the wind.. but for combat it hurts cause of the slow turning. This brings me to my last topic: anno 1800 feels slower than the previous games. I have a feeling everything takes a lot longer. Not only the ship movement but also the progress. All the productions take a long time after the farmers. For instance producing steel? I have to wait ages for some steel to build things and I can #8217;t afford to make even more companies cause of the huge worker amount and upkeep cost (I know it #8217;s faster with electricity but you don #8217;t get that early). I think it just feels very slow altogether. Which gives your more time for building things and decorating your city, but it also gives you less time when your being attacked and didn #8217;t prepare for it, you #8217;re doomed then. Any thoughts? Would appreciate it!</TEXT>

    <TEXT>The game is supre. There are still a few bugs, especially with the ship movement. But they will get fixed. First pitch is already coming in the 25.04. Like everyone said if u like city building games, it #8217;s one of the best not only from the anno series.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>U should be fine with shipping it back to ur mai. Island. Just when shipping from the new world it #8217;s a bit harsh cause of the shiptraveltime. If u don #8217;t want to produce only on ur main island, u can also build workers on the second island very easily (just fishery and cloths). When u click on a residents house, u can click on the different needs/luxuries to stop them from having and using them. So for instance u are making bread on ur second island but don #8217;t want them to eat it, then just click on the bread in their overlay and they won #8217;t eat it (depending on how many needs u are crossing out they might get angry cause they don #8217;t have enough needs fulfilled, so just play around a bit, but I think crossing out 1 thing shouldn #8217;t be an issue)</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Ah and another tip from me is, u can always easily produce enough for ur people with some workforce left at any given time, other wise it wouldn #8217;t be a balanced game. The thing is to not overproduce if ur workforce is almost gone. When selecting the next need/luxury that u want to start making, take a look at the residents overlay and hover ur mouse over the needs/luxuries. There u will see how many coins or workforce u will gain by delivering the new product. If u are Short on workforce maybe start producing an item that gives u that. Sometimes it #8217;s just a building that will give u workforce so just place it down and u should be good ;) Hope the these Tipps help!</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I ain #8217;t that high in Elo, am not best in solo carrying. But what I #8217;ve heard from some Video and kind of works pretty good is to skill 2 in w to wave clear the casters with 2 w #8216;s. Then skill q up max. This works well against melee champions because u get good counter damage when they jump on u or walk into melee range.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Don #8217;t overproduce and build enough houses. Specifically for anno 1800: U don #8217;t need to produce on each island, in the beginning producing on ur main island is enough (so u might only need farmers on ur second island) Have fun, not too hard at the start cause it #8217;s a slow paced game, but be careful if u have strong AI opponents: as soon as they start a war with u and ur not prepared they will fuck u up, since it #8217;s a slow paced game u can #8217;t build defenses fast / military ships. If u manage to get enough money, u can always pay for cease fire with the pirates, this helps a ton (for me atleast, no more worrying about enemy ships destroying ur own)</TEXT>

    <TEXT>My real question would be how many bought it on the epic store. If they sold a lot of copies, epic might do it a gain in the future.. For steam there are people who bought it pre release and people who will wait for it to come again. It #8217;s not too many I think, the majority of people don #8217;t really care about the game hoster or read news online.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Either you could build more production, or try to get to t4 citizen. Every citizen only has needs/luxuries from the tier before. So the t4 citizens wont need sausages anymore. And your t3 citizens don #8217;t need cloths anymore. So either upgrade your citizen or make up your production. As soon as you have a steady production and your not overproducing your balance should be good and you should gain money. If your not getting money then, try to get more luxuries, these give loads of cash</TEXT>

    <TEXT>They do have the rights, but epic is offering better shares of the sold copies and also money to be exclusives, which feels kind of bad as a gamer/consumer.(there #8217;s loads of discussion on this just google it). The games great, as an old anno fan it feels fresh but still on its roots. There #8217;s enough complexity to keep u going for a long time. The main problem atm is bugs. There #8217;s quite a lot of them and it sometimes doesn #8217;t feel good at all. (I haven experienced game breaking ones though) There #8217;s also some annoying things like bad ship movement/naval combat. Furthermore are the shear amounts of unorganisches trading routes and ships in the later stages. Don #8217;t get me wrong it #8217;s a great game, but not perfect yet ;) they will fix a lot (atleast that #8217;s what they are saying), I don #8217;t think they will let us down. All of the previews games turned out great (apart from 2205, that game was too far from the routes to be able to be called an anno game, still good on its own )</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Having goods in ur warehouse that don #8217;t get used is like buying a burger and only eating half of it, u throw the other half away.( that doesn #8217;t make sense xD) It #8217;s just wasted goods in ur warehouse. And i find selling items to npc inefficient cause u don #8217;t get much from it. I sold 300t of weapons (the first ones from worker class) to the lady in the new world and only got like 150k gold and 1t takes (without electricity etc) 90secs to produce. So it took 450mins to produce all that for only 150k? (Maybe my calculation is wrong but I think u get the point) I always try to perfect it by slowing building more production chains and observing if it #8217;s enough or not. I only do this with the more complicated ones. I usually build a few in blueprints in advance, so it #8217;s easier to just produce more. I like expanding so I know I #8217;ll need the extra farms in blue print at some point</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Yes u need houses on every island. But to just make farms work u only need farmers, for who u can easily produce the needs on every single island with a fishery and clothing chain. So basically u need a small town on each island. If u unlock t4 engineers u can build a commuter pier. When u build that on an island all workforce are combined and useable where eventually have an active commuter pier. With this I can change ur production buildings to a different island.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I didn #8217;t check why my ships were slowed down, nor if it was old or new. But when I have a fleet of many ships ready to fight and they are all full health and no cargo. When I send them over to the location, some of them are a lot faster than others with the same wind direction and so on. Another thing is sometimes when the sailing ships go with the wind they do the opposite: the sails flatter and the ship moves very slow as if it #8217;s sailing against the wind . A heads up check anno union they have an update released today for the next patch with the patch notes scheduled for next week. They might fix a few things there</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Well I #8217;m reconstructing it as well, I kept the main part of the Harbour, deleted a few repair cranes, Harbour offices und double shipyards cause I don #8217;t really need them. Demolished mostly everything else except for the roads around the world fair, since I didn #8217;t bother counting tiles to make it fit. Then kept a few other roads and mostly did an interesting layout (usually I just build semetrically) . I finally got a few investors and the world fair up. I am decorating the city part. To the left I got a zoo which hasn #8217;t been decorated yet and next to the cemetery I #8217;m making a museum. Deleting all the broken down houses also helps with the attractiveness by a ton. Atm I #8217;m waiting for patch 2 cause I have to deal with an npc and I want to make more ships (I #8217;ll get loads of more influence after the patch :))</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Hey, didn #8217;t have much time to play with the latest update, but I played for around 40mins and since the update my performance in this game increased from around 30-40fps in dense area with lots of buildings to 60-70fps (did not change anything in the setting.. and im even imagining that it looks better (probably cause it #8217;s less laggy)).

    <TEXT>Well I do find it a bit too far in, since the ships and turrets shoot very far which kind of feels good and revolutionary. It gives the whole thing an extra twist, but makes the whole micromanagement auf naval combat a bit too hard: sometimes my ship gets attacked, i click an the  #8220;jump to #8221; button and all I see is at ship, nothing more, so first of all I have to search for where the shots come from and sometimes I #8217;m too slow. So this thing does have two sides to it: feels pretty good but makes it less manageable. So if they change it (with better ship movement and commanding as well) I #8217;d see it all as a good thing, and I hope it #8217;s not too far out, just a bit so u can actually see the hostile attack ur ship at the edge of the screen. To the mod: I wouldn #8217;t use a third party mod, the game already has lots of bugs and crashes that could break ur game, I wouldn #8217;t want more. Just try to adapt to it. I #8217;m colorblind and I try to use good colors for me and the enemy so I can better manage my ships (I usually cut off enemy trade ships between island) via the minimap. Maybe this helps ;)</TEXT>

But anno 1602 has the best sound for me, I #8217;ve played this game when I was very young, it will always remind me of my childhood (nothing beats the emotional binding to some songs #128556;)</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Getting Tiamat isn #8217;t that great of a choice, it lacks in damage later on and if you sell it u waste money. Take a look at high elo builds, they don #8217;t always build Tiamat. I find it useful to put 2 points into w to kill the wave in 2x w (casters, melee I have to aa and q) and then build pure damage. I #8217;ve been doing pretty good and my lack of wave clear (I used to always build Tiamat for a long time) doesn #8217;t always bother me unless I #8217;m going up against some really pushy champs or super minions. If u time the roaming good, ex when u have priority in ur lane, u should be fine without it.</TEXT>

Play it safe, keep ur distance and punish him/her for going for cs (while dodging their harass). As ori u have the advantage of winning longer trades  #228;, they win small trades (atleast zed at the beginning, Yasuo I nice he hits a few early lvls is just a pain, which he is for everyone)</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Cities skylines is a totally different game, it has a very different approach to building a city. I could go into very detail, but i think its best for u to just try it out. Im am Anno veteran, played it since Anno 1602 and am in love with it, it has a unique playstyle to it, Getting the needs up to upgrade ur citizen and make them happy. Building ships, making trade routes and getting the productions right is fundamental here City skylines has a strong focus on traffic managing, making 1 big city with different districts for different needs for the city/houses. Theres no enemy u have to fight and units to control, u build different types of roads and have to manage ur traffic in and out of the city. You can build beautiful cities here aswell without money problems if you want. So this is a city simulation game. Id say try city skylines aswell, especially with mods, I #8217;ve put hundreds of hours into as well because i like building my own little (or big) city with different districts.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Orianna is a Control Support mage. With her ball u can often Zone people out if they know u have ultimate up. U can even zone during Laning Phase, so if they walk up for cs and touch ur ball u can q the ball on the enemy (w is very mana hungry and not always useful early). Maxing q and harassing/csing with q is ur best bet early. Mid/late game is all about groupin, splitpushing, objectives and picking the right fights. As orianna its great to have someone who can engage and cc a lot and u will want to group. Since ur a support control mage and not a 1 shot mage assassin. U are good if the fight takes longer and can support ur frontline/carry with ur damage/cc/shield. (If u are fed u will be able to 1 shot some aswell, but after ur ultimate u are a bit defenseless alone, because u have cds and the enemy will go hard in u, so don #8217;t take the frontline, unless u are baiting zonyas) Forcing the enemy to walk through ur ball is always good. So when picking fights and u place ur ball into a pathway so the enemy has to take a longer route or reposition/cut off someone, is always a good idea (not if uncut off the fed person who will Penta kill ur whole team, but u know what I mean ;)) A great tip is to, like someone already mentioned, is to be aggressive in lane and sometime use ultimate for someone to just have to recall. Most of the time u won #8217;t be able to 1 shot them but make them force back. After u cleared the most minions from a wave and enemy wants to xD and uses a damage spell to cs and ur a bit closer to ur tower this is a good idea to ultimate him(very good is to knock him back to ur tower for some extra space) and start Autoing him and q w him while he rubs back to his tower. Good idea is to poke him a bit before with a q w but sometimes it #8217;s also good to do an aggressive surprise ultimate when he is max health. Pay attention to ur items when I get power spikes, u will Noticably make more damage and can alsmost kill them. I usually only go with a corrupting pot. Especially for the sustain and mana Regen. But also to win early trades: with ur passive and extra auto damage u will be able to harass him insanely well if u can hit him a lot (just take care of the enemy minions who aggro u) I am stuck in high gold atm, but i tend to find myself playing like a mid/high plat. I love teamcomps/fighting like a team and in this elo it #8217;s a bit hard.. in my elo is, if I play ori, always take barrier. The enemy will usually Always forget that u have it. And u get pushed in and enemy kungele comes and they want to dive u, and that #8217;s a huge mistake cause of ur cc, shield and barrier. That #8217;s how I normally get the lead. And don #8217;t forget u scale very good and will be almost 1 shotting squishies late game with a qw combo. So even if behind try to get ur good zoning and ultis out and protect the one who does most damage. Orianna has the potential to stall out a game with ur wave clear and zoning/supporting. Orianna is a Great Champ, Love her the Most. She #8217;s usually a safe pick, has no hard counters and fits in almost all teamcomps. My last tip: google probuilds Orianna. There u will get a good idea of what to build in some match ups and what runes to take. Cheers  #129346;</TEXT>

    <TEXT>My friend and I are looking for some people to play a survival world with the latest snapshots together. We usually build big things together, go on adventures, fight ourselves through things, figure out how to make a redstone contraption (or just use YouTube :D ) and have a good time. We are in our mid twenties and from Germany, but anybody who #8217;s relaxed and wants to have fun together is welcome. You can mind your own business, build somewhere else if you want, nothings strict here. just to have someone to talk to while building alone/together makes it more fun. Not being alone in your own survival world is far better! It #8217;s also fun to see a new structure that has been built and which hasnt been there before, when you #8216;ve not been online for a bit #128579; We don #8217;t want any griefers or anything, you can have your own tools and items etc. and you can bring along a friend and build your own base together. we #8217;ve started a vanilla server (it #8217;s originally a single player world that I started alone and now my friend has joined and we opened up a server, so he is just starting out aswell! we are trying out a few vanilla tweaks, like multiplayer sleep, so only 1 person has to be in bed to sleep. we have also put up a death counter so we know how often someone dies... just for the fun of it :-) if your interested just leave a comment below and we can get in touch! Basic human rules like being respectful, not destroying the world, griefing, etc. should be followed. If we ever get a small community up we can make a more formal approach to applications, basic rules etc. But for now this is just a very laid back, fun server with a few people to enjoy surviving, building, exploring together or to just enjoy the company of someone in a virtual world :) Server IP: 62.104.73.15</TEXT>

We are a small group of friends from Germany in our mid 20s who have been enjoying Minecraft since our school years. We have always been keen on playing together and having fun in this virtual world. At this point in time, we have figured out, sharing this great experience with more people is even better, especially because not all of our school friends play Minecraft anymore. Living in a world not only by ourselves is a lot more enjoyable and fun! Seeing buildings grow and other things being built from other people is just a great feeling and gives so much joy. There are no set rules on where you have to be on the server, it would be cool if we are all closer together so we can see each other from time to time or build bigger projects together. We can always connect each other through the nether You have total freedom of everything as long as you respect the few rules so everyone can have the best possible vanilla experience. Features: - This is a vanilla server and there are no mods installed. - We try to use the latest snapshots, since we love testing out the new features from mojang. - We do everything in survival, no creative or other game modes. - There will be no commands for items/levels/spawning etc. Literally the scoreboard command will be used, because we like to see how often someone dies when pressing tab We are testing out some data packs(my first time ever), just to tweak the experience a tiny bit.

We have a designated spawn area with shops and a town hall. The world is a few weeks old but nothing big has been built yet. We also run a few vanilla tweaks to insure a smooth gameplay and for some extra fun. We are a small community looking for some new players to have fun with and build stuff together.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>There are some nice answers here already. But I #8217;ll add a few words. Like already mentioned the most important part is to  #8222;Just take your time #8220; the game is very complex at first or even later. As a SP managing multiple worlds is very hard, the Coop Mode is very beneficial here, but it still works in SP. What you have to to is stabilize your islands. I #8217;m not sure if you have found the statistic screen yet, but you can see how many tonnes per minute an island uses (either uses in production or consumes from the residences) If everything is in the green (not really green, just positive) your island is set and can be left alone for most of the time. There are currently 4 maps and by the end of this year with season pass 2 #8216;s final DLC we will get a 5th map with new residences and needs. To know about the maps: 2 of the maps are from the standard game and are necessary to get all investors. CAPE Trelawny only has a huge island and some good items but has nothing new to it, so this could be left alone if you don #8217;t want that huge island. The Arctic introduces air ships which are neat for end game trading routes (although in tonnes per min it #8217;s not the fastest cause it only has 4 slots) and some alternative things like better gold mines and a different fuel source for electricity. It adds its own residences but it is NOT needed for your old world residences. So if you are struggling with managing multiple worlds, keep it slow, make sure your islands are some what safe to leave alone for a while. If you have a NUM Pad your can use numbers 1-4 to cycle through your worlds with ease (or bind it in the options to something else)</TEXT>

    <TEXT>What I struggle with, even after hundreds of hours of gameplay is the long travel distance between the old and new world for production (for example Rum or cotton delivery). Make sure you have enough ships assigned to that route. My Tipp here is that in the route management you can set a few rules to the ships, for example to wait until it is fully loaded/unloaded before taking off to the next destination. I usually make enough piers on a rum island and make the ships wait until they are fully loaded to make most out of the travel distance, not sure if this is the best way but it seems to work out for me) Glad I could help you out :)</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I second that. Every time I start a new game I think to myself: I want a challenge and not just build in an empty world. But then the lvl 3 difficulty guys are constantly in war with me and annoy me cause they don #8217;t wanna peace with me even though I could wipe them off the waters in a finger snip. Then I am forced to fight them and can #8217;t build and expand on my city, which I actually enjoy a lot more since the ship fights are not the best in a game like this and mostly it #8217;s the more fire power wins (spamming ship of the lines wins any island over, at least vs AI) For the resource difficulty etc I usually put everything in medium and the island difficulty easy, since I like to build big cities and I need the space. If u want a little challenge at the beginning got for low income, it gets irrelevant cause at some point ull have millions (If u know what ur doing). Pirates are always on hard. If u can #8217;t deal with them u can pay off a peace treaty, usually not too expensive, at any point. Trading with them is insane. You can sell 1t of rum for 2000 coins each. So one full steam cargo nets u I believe half a million (I #8217;m a bit tired atm :D) A tip: to buy steam ships u can just buy them off the NPC. They are not too expensive and I don #8217;t best steel beams nor those mashines(forgot the name). Hope this helps.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Do u mean the Anarchist? The anarchist is a dlc which has some items (that u can buy from his Harbour), quests and newspaper options (which I personally don #8217;t use for my type of playing) that are only available if u have the anarchist NPC in ur session. I typically like to play very long sessions conquering the whole world and building mega cities, that #8217;s why I usually have him in the game so I can have all the content that anno offers in one session so I don #8217;t have to start a new one. For the NPCs: lvl 2 NPCs are usually peaceful in my sessions, the lvl 3 NPCs always start war cause one of them likes and the other one doesn #8217;t like me using the newspaper.. but maybe I #8217;m just not good at having good relationships :D</TEXT>

    <TEXT>We have 2 Seasons. Season 1: Botanica(Just more Cultural Stuff: Very similar to Museums and Zoos) Sunken Treasures (New Play Session with the biggest island to build a huge city which is kind of nice, but for me it always makes myself only build my big city on that island, but still a great dlc) The Passage (New Play Session with new Residents and an alternative Energy and Airships for Trading that fly over land) Season 2: Seat of Power (Adds a powerful modular Building to one of your Islands with your main residences and adds many statistical buffs that improve micromanagement by a lot! But is mainly for end game and people who know what they are doing to make stuff efficient) Bright Harvest (Adds grain Silos to Boost Animal Farms by 100% efficiency and adds Tractorbarn that use oil for Crop Farms to add 200%. This DLC is mainly to make less Farms but more efficient and bigger ones. Good to use with trading halls. Land of Lion (Not released yet but seems to be one of the biggest add ones with new residences and playsession and all) Each Season DLC is obtainable separately or together in bundles 1 and 2. if ur really into it I #8217;d recommend getting both Seasons for the ultimate gameplay. There is a lot to explore and each DLC adds another thing to consider while building and expanding. If ur not getting all DLCs then I #8217;d atleast recommend all the new game sessions. The least important DLC imo is Botanica. Anarchist is a new Charakter NPC to have in ur session, obtainable with the deluxe edition. The interesting part is the new items that he introduced into the game, but I only buy 2-4 different items from him that I use. Don #8217;t know if that #8217;s really worth it. He is also only playable as a 2 star difficulty that cant be changed. I hope this helps :) I have both season passes and anarchist and I #8217;m really happy with al the additions.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>This is a small vanilla server with a few vanilla tweaks. We started out as a small group of friends from Germany. We are in our mid 20s and have been enjoying Minecraft since our school years. We have always been keen on playing together and having fun in this virtual world. At this point in time, we have figured out, sharing this great experience with more people is even better, especially because not all of our school friends play Minecraft anymore. Living in a world not only by ourselves is a lot more enjoyable and fun! Seeing buildings grow and other things being built from other people is just a great feeling and gives so much joy. There are no set rules on where you have to be on the server, it would be cool if we are all closer together so we can see each other from time to time or build bigger projects together. We can always connect each other through the nether You have total freedom of everything as long as you respect the few rules that are stated on our discord server, like the use of common sense when doing something that could hurt someone else #8217;s feelings or builds. Play on the server so everyone can have the best possible vanilla experience. We have grown into a small european community with people from all over Europe atm. We have refreshed the world for 1.16. We are planing on raiding the 1st dragon together as a group. We welcome all new trustworthy members. Features: This is a vanilla server and there are no mods installed.

They are totally listening to t he community.. almost everything is being addressed to in the update 9, also some quality of life things, which is a reason why I #8217;m not playing right now, cause I want all the update 9 features to enjoy the Game even further. Best thing would be the specific item research, the new land going for a similar style to anno 1404 and moving clay pits?:P finally an efficient place for all the clay pit items ;D (and aesthetics lol)</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Usually it #8217;s compatible. I think it occurred only once that the save games were unusable. But they do sometimes change island generation (last time they changed how many Zink and copper deposits are around, but nothing totally game changing). When The new dlc is out and u launch ur save it asks u if u want to permanently add the dlc content to ur game or not. But since this is a huge dlc, this option might be unavailable. So no guarantee. On a side note: I #8217;m waiting for the dlc to start fresh and the most immersive anno game to date :) they are adding so many quality of life stuff that it #8217;ll be so much fun starting new (for me atleast  #128579;)</TEXT>

    <TEXT>This is a small vanilla server with a few vanilla tweaks. We started out as a small group of friends from Germany. We are in our mid 20s and have been enjoying Minecraft since our school years. We have always been keen on playing together and having fun in this virtual world. At this point in time, we have figured out, sharing this great experience with more people is even better, especially because not all of our school friends play Minecraft anymore. Living in a world not only by ourselves is a lot more enjoyable and fun! Seeing buildings grow and other things being built from other people is just a great feeling and gives so much joy. There are no set rules on where you have to be on the server, it would be cool if we are all closer together so we can see each other from time to time or build bigger projects together. We can always connect each other through the nether You have total freedom of everything as long as you respect the few rules that are stated on our discord server, like the use of common sense when doing something that could hurt someone else #8217;s feelings or builds. Play on the server so everyone can have the best possible vanilla experience and respect the spawn area, this is a community area. We have grown into a small european community with people from all over Europe atm. We have refreshed the world for 1.16. We welcome all new trustworthy members. We all have our own jobs and real life, but being active every now and then would be nice. Especially participation in community builds and events helps grow this community closer together! You can host your own events or build your big project ideas too. Features: This is a vanilla server and there are no mods installed. We are running on papermc with a few little tweaks that visually don #8217;t change the vanilla gameplay but improve the multiplayer smoothness by a lot. Paper also helps me figure out lag issues a lot better, if there are any. We do everything in survival, no creative or other game modes. There will be no commands for items/levels/spawning etc. Literally the scoreboard command will be used, because we like to see how often someone dies when pressing tab. (This might changed once the arena and pvp tournaments are held  #128556;) We are testing out some data pack just to tweak vanilla experience a tiny bit. These are not final and might be changed in the future, depending on what the majority thinks is too much or needs to be added. Following Data packs are currently installed: Mob Heads have a chance of dropping on a kill (Reason: Fun) Player Heads will drop if killed by a player (Reason: Fun) The Enderdragon will drop an elytra (Reason: this helps the long marches through the end when it #8217;s been raided for thousands of blocks already) Shulkers drop 2 shells each (Reason: Same as above) XYZ and Time Display (Reason: Ability to show only the Coordinates and Direction instead of the whole F3 screen, which is overwhelmed by information and text) AFK Display (Reason: To see if someone is afk and not active) Multiplayer Sleep (Reason: Only 50% of the people online have to sleep to skip the night. We have changed this from 1 player sleep this week and it seems to be better this way) As with every decision, I as a server owner will ask my fellow members and debate on new data packs or community projects. I #8217;d love for you to help me out with new community projects and ideas! This is not just about my ideas, we are all working in this world together! (At least in the Community area, your bases and farms are all private property  #128076; #127995;) We are currently looking for people around Europe Timezone. Since this is a small server it #8217;s beneficial to have people online at around the same time. If you are interested come join our discord server and introduce yourself to us: [https://discord.gg/ysNpqW7](https://discord.gg/ysNpqW7) See you soon! TeCK</TEXT>
