    <TEXT>This team works so well for me and most important thing of course, I really enjoy playing with my real life favorite players. Centers have solid 80-83 face-offs, but maybe could be little bit better. https://hutdb.net/18/builder/1007387</TEXT>

    <TITLE>Using only players you get from packs</TITLE>
    <DATE>2017-12-13 16:32:57</DATE>
    <TEXT>UPDATED TEAM: And after opening packs, heres the current team Im using with some synergies (Wish I had better left defenders): https://hutdb.net/18/builder/1015301 Because of market crash and ability to get good players too easily and cheap, I came up with this idea to make HUT more exciting for myself again. Selling my whole team and start using only players I get from packs so no more using of auction house. After selling my team, Im going to have about 1,3-1,4 million coins so I understand It's still going to be "easy" to get good team cause of better "good player" packing changes this year, but the synergy stuff will be more complicated to build of course. Well... Lets see how long I can keep going this way lol. Going to post the complete team after current team sold and packs opened. What you guys think about this? Some best pulls: Base gold cards: Karlsson, Doughty, Stamkos, Benn, Malkin, Ovechkin, Burns, Holtby, Bobrovsky, Keith, Weber, Backstrom, Tarasenko, Getzlaf, Marchand, Scheifele etc. Ice: Ovechkin, Laine, Radulov, Monahan, Eichel, Stone, Hoffman, Bailey, Hellebuyck, Gostisbehere, Oshie, Werenski, Smith, Ehlers, Neil, Boeser, Trocheck Andersen, Shattenkirk, Muzzin, Rielly, Rantanen, Zuccarello, Barrie, Perron, Dadonov, Mantha, Turris, Brown Prime time/Milestone/Helpers: Gibson, Sharp, Both Sedins TOTW: Kopitar, Jamie Benn, Wheeler, Doughty, Yandle, Jenner, Hart (BTOTW) Evolution: MacKinnon, Josi, Drouin Links for pack pulls: (https://www.reddit.com/r/NHLHUT/comments/7jn1gz/only_using_players_from_packs_collector_pack_with/) https://www.reddit.com/r/NHLHUT/comments/7k22zq/anders_lee_looks_little_bit_like_vampire_but_i/</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Speaking of myself, ofc it will affect in interest negatively. Like you said, all the fantasy cards and not having new real life performance cards from NHL, but I believe we still get updates and EA will figure out something if cancelling the season will be the case. Lets hope for the best that there will be playoffs and Avs goes all the way to finals! :)</TEXT>
