    <TEXT>First of all, does it still hurt? Do you feel any pain in that area? Is it black, white, brown or yellow? You can have a third-degree burn. If so, you need medical attention. If you have a second-degree burn, its kinda wet, has blisters and hurts when you touch. If so, and its still like this after these three weeks, i would advice you to get medical attention. You also need to wrap it with vaseline gauze (which you have to buy, don't DIY this) and but a bandage over it. I most definitely advice medical attention even though i understand how you feel bc of corona. Also i think there's supposed to be a photo which i can't see, that's why im asking these questions.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Knowing what it feels like to lose someone to suicide (they were like a sibling to me, even though we only knew each other for two years) and the pain and trauma it causes. Because my best friend means the world to me and i can't hurt her or any of my other friends more. Because when i am very low and scared of myself, i try to tell myself that my previous attempts didn't work because i didnt think it out enough and i should wait and work on the plan a little more. I wanna kms but i don't have to be in a hurry. I tend to think i am, but i am not. So i tell myself when the urges are sky high: i can do it tomorrow instead, or the day after that. Usually the day after i can hold myself back. Stay safe</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I won't tell who ever want to die to bake cookies or read a book, because it never worked for me at all. People kept telling me i would hurt people, but i couldn't see meaning in my existence let alone see that other people did. When i was thirteen and i got admitted to a mental hospital. I was scared to death and everyone was older than me. I met this girl who was the most sweet peach on the earth. I didn't know her well or talked to her much, but seeing her and hearing her giving me advice made me feel warm inside -warm of hope. One night we had to sit down and we got told she killed herself. I cried for ages. I cared more for her than she had ever known and she was the reason i didnt end myself right then. I got good friends with her best friend, will call her O. She became like a sister to me, but was extremely ill. I was on the same ward and had to calm her down and get the nurses when she screamed at night, had to go outside because she pressed the fire alarm to escape from the closed ward, had to help the nurses kick her door in while she tried to kill herself. Everyone around me told me a nineteen year old girl like that was to heavy in my life. That she would maybe end herself and i shouldn't have to bear that. I thought about it alot. I really did. And i said 'fine, she's so dear to me that if she dies, i'll have that enormous burden on my shoulders, but i can't and won't give up on her'. She helped me alot, but killed herself in the first few days of 2019. It traumatized me to my core. I cry when i see the ward we where on, i have flashbacks and nightmares and i can't, can't get out of my head she died alone that night. I was fourteen and started hating myself for something i didn't cause. I saw and still see myself as a murder because on the everyday streek we talked, that one day, i didn't reply to her 'i'm alright, thanks tho'. Sometimes we find flowers on her grave with names we don't know or teddy bears that came from none of us. Almost nobody was aloud at the funeral yet i got 100+ messages that were looking comfort and wanted to join the goodbye i organized. You can't live for other people and your suffering will feel unbearable, but oh my dear god, are you precious and will people mourn and cry and break down because the only lived because of you, little do you know what good you do</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Its a personal story, but i'm trying to tell you that people surrounding you are a reason to delay your suicidal thoughts. I know you may feel like you need to hurry, but wait another day, for that one friend. Another hour, just for sunrise. Another minute, for the new song to repeat. Still feel shit? Another minute. Breathe. Cry. Another minute. You are strong and you'll survive another minute. You are about to do something that will take all your time away. That will keep you from another call or another latte or another yt video. Just just breath. Its how i get through it, honestly. I promise there will come an inhale which you don't regret and i promise that if you still wanna die next week, you still can. Look what you've been through. Look what you've made it through. I am proud of you. I really am. I am crying for you, dear stranger, because your pain is the pain i feel as well. Why don't we breathe together for another minute? The stress is horrible, isn't it? Doesn't it feel better when you just push it away for another minute? Please stay self. Please</TEXT>

    <TEXT>So i (16F) have been dealing with self harm since i was nine, have severe depression and am chronically suicidal ( amp; have some other diagnoses). Things started to fall apart bc of the quarantine and my suicidal thoughts are going crazy, i wanna attempt again but i don't wanna fail and i honest to god try to hold on bc of my best friend who means everything to me. The only way i can handle everything is by cutting and they wanna get me inpatient for the fourth time, bur most of my trauma's are related to that place and another clinic is too scary for me since i dont know the staff and my therapists don't have anything to say. They want me to stop cutting but its the only thing keeping me alive. I had a session today where they said all of that, but i feel hopeless. I wanna cut myself open. I just... need to. I'll end myself otherwise</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I have tried over 10 variations of therapy and i find it hard to talk to my family, especially considering i have only my parents to talk to and with the rest of my family i have a difficult relationship. My parents are very heartbroken bc of my mental state and talking about how i feel in detail will make them sad for days, which triggers me to cut bc i feel bad. It doesn't work. No and i work in a cat cafe so i have a valid reason to go to work bc they have to be fed  amp; stuff and they can't be alone for more than 10 hours, which they already are at night. I need like a day with this and that and this and that and feeling soooo overwhelmed at the end of the day (i have light autism as well so i get overwhelmed quit quickly) that i can't think clear. Thats the only thing that has helped and in my country at the moment, impossible to replace. Yeah i can enjoy some yt but it doesnt make me not wanna cut or not wanna die, yk  amp; tiktok isnt really my cup of tea.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I mean, i was in a bad place, but i was nine when i started cutting myself. I was a little heavier than the other kids because i was already in puberty and gaining the weight that goes with that, without growing yet. I actually ate extremely healthy for my age, which was confirmed when my parents kept my eating dairy and doctors looked at it. Thats why they thought i didn't have to lose weight, just had to be stable and grow. I did in a few months i grew. I however, before that, hated myself and my weight and PLEASE REMEMBER I WAS NINE thought i just could cut off my fat. Its such a stupid reason. I started scratching to build a pain tolerance, so i guess we did the same thing there, and started cutting deeper pretty quickly. At that point i was at a normal weight (even at the lower side) and had realized cutting made me feel better, so i never tried cutting off my fat, thank god. However got anorexia later on  amp; started cutting severely, got depressed an all that shit.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Nope. They just call whoever is your 'contact' person and let them know you died and how. Your stuff goes tho whoever it belongs to after you're dead, if you ain't a minor i think you have control over that. They honestly don't bother investigating unless someone of your family sue someone saying that its their fault. Its really not like the movies. If you have a password on your phone, people will not be able to get access to it. I've lost multiple people to suicide and neither of the families where able to get into the phones, even not when trying to hack it and stuff. But i can promise you losing someone to suicide is more painful and more traumatizing than anything i've been through, its really hard and you may think people won't care, but they will.</TEXT>

It traumatized me to my core and i still have flashbacks and nightmares everyday to things that happend when we were on the same ward in the mental hospital. I miss her so much. I've lost a few more that i didn't knew that well, but it still hurts me today. Its different from any other death cause. It'll ruin you for ever. You will keep blaming yourself, doesn't matter what the suicide letter says or what people tell you or what therapy helps you with. You are forever unable to recover and you always will live with a bit of self hatred because you feel like it was your fault and you never, never get all rhe answers.

You'll start to hallucinate after a few days as well. You can have seizures and get really confused (i can promise you that last one will happen). Your skin won't stretch anymore and you probably will get a fever. Its miserable and painful for sure.

    <TEXT>hi i read the top comment and realized i might have absolutely misunderstood why you where asking if they looked deep. i assumed you wantend comfort and hear they don't look deep bc it would make you uncomfortable if they did look deep. but now i see you were maybe asking for validation and felt like they weren't deep enough. i'm truly sorry if i totally misread/misunderstood your question and i wanted to mention that your pain is absolutely valid, no matter the depth of you cuts. i was trying to help you but i know see how i might have done the opposite, but i absolutely didn't mean to! i see your pain and it truly doesn't matter to me nor should it matter to anyone how deep you cut, but how much mental pain you have. you deserve love and help, always. stay strong  lt;3</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I agree. I've noticed ppl don't understand everyone has a different brain, different feelings and different reactions to things -and we're not even talking circumstances. Just because you react differently doesn't mean the reaction of someone else to the same 'problem' is invalid. Some people are fine with going through the things that heavily traumatized me, but unlike me, get heavily traumatized by other things that don't traumatize me. Just because you don't see it as a reason to commit suicide doesn't mean it isn't for someone else. tf is wrong with ppl who think that lol</TEXT>

    <TEXT>i understand what you're trying to say and the main message is good, but ""don't be that dude"" just doesn't sit right with me at all. You didn't have to add that and for me it comes a cross as if you judge everyone (like me) that struggles to find other coping mechanisms. Because I've tried them all, including running. Including intensive therapy, being admitted for weeks and countless of medications. Including all the other ones anyone ever suggested to me. I'm sorry I'm 'that dude' for having a this habit due to chronic mental health problems. It ain't that easy for all of us, dude.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Hi, Please let me explain why I think this was a unhelpful thing to reply. I've grown up in mental hospitals, so I know many people (including myself) that have suicidal tendencies or behavior. Some recovered after two years, some after a month, some after fifteen years and some never. And it has nothing to do with emotions. Mental illnesses or mental health problems are your brain being sick. Depression, for instance, is visible on brain scans and has proven to affect your brain functioning. Being sad or empty or whatever due to your depression (to keep this one as example, but it applies to every mental illness or mental health problem) is a symptom of the illness of your brain. Like someone with brain cancer can have headaches because of the tumor. Both cases can't change that. You can't tell someone to just decide not to have a headache and the same goes for, for instance, sadness. What you mean, i think, is that you have a saying in what you want to do with that headache. Do you go and stay in bed all day or do you decide to go for a walk or take meds or whatever. Most of the time you can make a decision what you do with it. Just like you can decide what you do what you're gonna do with your sadness. Now we have that out of the way, I still have a problem with that mindset. Some people really can change and will be better because they decide to fight against their sadness, which won't go over night, but will be a hard process. You are right, some people really do find something in meditation and books and it helps them, over a LONG period of time, recover. Yes, this takes time. When you finish the book you won't be better. Unfortunately, that isn't how it works. There are people that will have problems for the rest of their lives, however. Because they're chronically ill. And some learn to cope with that and live a life without experiencing -happiness for instance. But there are also people that just can't get better, no matter how hard they try. Some have literally tried every therapy, every medication, every coping that is out there, but don't get better. We're talking, in my country, from mindfulness and meditation to therapy like ECT, and everything in between, but their brain is to sick. You never know the outcome, i agree. You never know if there isn't a day that you will feel better. And in no way do i want people to think there is no hope for them. I am just trying to explain what my own experiences are and why i strongly dislike what you said also, my native language isn't english so excuse the mistakes lmao</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I answered you privately, but in the case someone else is looking for it too and somehow sees this, what i know is that it really depends on the country or area that you live in. Besides from emergency hotlines like the suicide hotlines (that are also different in many countries), where i live you also have free chatrooms with professionals depending on what you need. Most countries have also rape or sexual abuse hotlines or chatrooms. Domestic violence (for children and partners), eating disorder, anxiety and depression hotlines and chatrooms are also available in my country. And there of course is paid professional concealing online, but i honestly don't know to much about that. https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_suicide_crisis_lines Here is the best list of worldwide hotlines i could find</TEXT>

I'm chronically ill, that was determined after years and years of treatment, including medications and years in a mental hospital. I tried everything they told me. Every list you can find online.

    <TEXT>I (16F) have tried to commit suicide multiple times in the past years and have been admitted to a mental hospital for two year. Last year I went home and gained the weight back i lost due to my anorexia. I am in no way recovered, but have been on a healthy weight since. But I've been very suicidal lately. I actually want to slit my wrists but know this is likely to be unsuccessful. If I die, it would be great. If I don't, I'll get admitted again. That essentially my suicide plan. Get admitted again, stop eating as long as they let me before admitting me to a normal hospital. When they are about to and I'm a little bit less fat, I want to end everything in a way i know will be successful. My parents won't find me bc it would be in the hospital. I honestly feel like that plan makes me a horrible person but i'm desperate and have no idea of what to do at this point</TEXT>

I don't have any therapy at the moment, my meds don't work and school gives me so much stress. All my problems have made a return. I really wish I could go back to that safe bubble, even tho i hated it so much. I wish i could get kept safe, have 24/7 help and have day structure that didn't ask to much of me. god i miss it rn</TEXT>
