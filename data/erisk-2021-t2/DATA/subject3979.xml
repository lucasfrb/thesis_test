    <TITLE>Sister Friede: Annoying to anyone else?</TITLE>
    <DATE>2018-01-20 07:08:07</DATE>
    <TEXT>I've been going through the game again on a new character, and I just finished up Ashes by killing Friede, and honestly, she might be one of my least favorite bosses in Soulsborne. (Which is a pity, since without her second phase, she'd probably be one of my favorites) I'm someone who prefers soloing, and I avoid summoning unless I'm desperate. This makes Friede really painful, since I'm either giving the choice of killing her solo, which usually takes me a while since she fucks my playstyle, and summoning another player/Gael and feeling like I took the cheap option, since she's a piece of cake that way. The gap between the difficulty of solo and coop really bugs me. Anyone else?</TEXT>

    <TITLE>Odd Bug</TITLE>
    <DATE>2019-04-25 07:25:07</DATE>
    <TEXT>Hey, I've noticed an incredibly odd bug in my game. For whatever reason, the Blackguard's Gloves are brighter in first person. They look normal in third person, but in first person they seem to almost glow. It's not that much of an issue during the day, but at night, it's extremely obvious. It's only an issue with the Blackguard and Linwe's gloves, and occurs even with different texture mods installed. I'm honestly stumped on it and was wondering if anyone had any ideas.  #8203; [https://imgur.com/a/FPKWYKw](https://imgur.com/a/FPKWYKw)</TEXT>

I then tried removing the first snow layer to see if that was killing the spawns. Nothing. I then covered the biome in a layer of stone to get the light level to 0. Still nothing. What the hell?

    <TITLE>Secretive Long-Range Passengers</TITLE>
    <DATE>2019-11-08 08:46:28</DATE>
    <TEXT>Anyone else feel like these missions are exceedingly badly designed? I understand it's to add challenge, but in this case, the punishment for failing that particular challenge is way out of proportion. It's easy to forget that you need to avoid scans after exploring for several days, and once you start being scanned, you only have a few seconds to deploy a heat sink. If you miss that five-second window, you lose the whole payout, and from the view of the contract, you traveled all that way for nothing. Having your ship be destroyed or exceeding the mission time limit would be mistakes deserving of having the entire mission failed, but the scanning requirements aren't. This doesn't even make sense from a lore perspective, either. If you got into a taxi, asked them to drive you a hundred miles away, then refused to pay them because you weren't satisfied by their driving, that would be a crime. In-Universe, there would be extremely little incentive for captains to take such passengers given the risk of not being paid at all. That's without mentioning how little sense it makes that a passenger who isn't a criminal would be incensed by being scanned by a police ship. It might be understandable if you were scanned by the space paparazzi, but getting mad at being scanned by *anyone* is a bit much. A better system would be for satisfaction to have a separate, smaller payout given on completion of the mission, similar to a tip. If the passenger isn't satisfied, you miss out on the tip, but you still get paid for the work you put in. This could also be seen as a simple flat starting value to get a captain to agree to the trip, as a sort of insurance. Long-range missions with secretive passengers could also just become a separate type, with secretive passengers awarding higher payouts instead of all passenger missions being secretive. Or, for a lore-sensible version, secretive passengers could simply be designed to ignore scans by police ships and stations, and instead only have their satisfaction reduced if scanned by bounty-hunting or pirating vessels. Or for an even simpler solution, the number of scans before a passenger fails the mission could be increased. This was mostly just a venting post for me after I failed a 50 mil mission to a system close to Sag A\*. After having reached the system, and making my first visit to the center, I stopped by Explorer's Anchorage for a rest stop and failed the mission after being scanned by the station. I still have my scan data, but it's just frustrating for the mission to have suddenly ending like it did. I'm keeping my hopes up that Frontier will revisit this and implement one of the changes I suggested, or something else that's a bit less aggravating.</TEXT>

    <TITLE>Reshade Suddenly Causing Crashes</TITLE>
    <DATE>2019-11-10 03:34:46</DATE>
    <TEXT>I've been using a Reshade preset on the game for a while now, but earlier, the game crashed out of the blue, and now crashes on launch. The game opens, but as soon as I click on it, it crashes. I can get as far as the main menu screen and it seems to work fine as long as the game isn't in focus, but the second I put it in focus, I get sent to the desktop. I've tried restarting my PC, updating my drivers, verifying the game files, refreshing my graphics settings, and reinstalling the game. Nothing. For whatever reason, my Reshade preset not longer works with the game. Anyone have any ideas on what the issue might be, or am I just going to have to go without? Edit: Also taking recommendations for good Reshade presets. I just picked one out of the ones listed on the Graphics Mod page on the wiki.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Accidentally dropped into a white dwarf's jet stream, almost immediately after warping into a system and I really feel the method for escaping should be way less RNG. With how much your ship spins, it's practically impossible to aim at an escape vector long enough to warp back into supercruise. You're just left to desperately try to spin your ship while it's slowly destroyed. If they want dropping into a jet stream to kill you, it should just kill you. Instead, you have to either self-destruct or wait five minutes. It just feels insulting. Not to mention their exclusion zones are massive compared to neutron stars, while their boost is pathetic. Anyone else feel they could go for a redesign? Or at the very least a less annoying jet stream escape method, maybe similar to the current interdiction system.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I feel like a lot of you are giving Joey more shit than he really deserves. Before I say why, I would like to say that I'm not exactly up to date with all the TTR drama. It's not something I really care about, so I'm viewing this as an outside observer who may not be aware of all the little details. That being said, the guy is a college student (Or at least college age, I'm not 100% sure) volunteering his time to help development an old MMO a lot of people are nostalgic about. His response, while not perfect, does seem fairly genuine, and it's obvious he put a good amount of time into making it sound professional. It was an appropriate response for the situation, and avoided escalating things with personal attacks.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>From my perspective, this all seems a tad bit over-dramatic. Joey is a college student volunteering his time to work on an old MMO game we played as kids. His response didn't really strike me as hollow. It seems more like he's just trying not to escalate the situation by keeping a lighthearted tone. I don't know enough about all this to say whether your decision to bring this to a community forum was a good idea, but I do think keeping the drama to a minimum should be a priority (Not THE priority, of course). A heated argument among the developers might reduce the trust the community has in them to the point that the argument becomes more harm than good. I'm mostly just trying to make suggestions, so if it seems like I'm attacking you, that's not my intent at all.</TEXT>

You could potentially have restrained from mentioning Sheriff more, but that might have caused its own issues.

    <TEXT>In this case, I'd say you're a bigger asshole than she is. Your description of her was plain insulting. Assuming you're not misrepresenting the situation, her initial response was probably because she has a history of being insulted for her appearance, just like you did. The fact that you lied to a police officer, and likely wasted his time, to get her in trouble for that says nothing good about you, and if you had even an ounce of sympathy, you'd feel ashamed for posting this.</TEXT>

    <TITLE>Steam Being Scummy With Wallet</TITLE>
    <DATE>2020-02-02 06:17:52</DATE>
    <TEXT>**Edit: The extra $3 was because I was viewing the prices in pounds, not dollars. Steam listed the dollar value, which was correct. Disregard everything in this post. I'll let it stand as a monument to me being an idiot.**  #8203; So I purchased $10 for my Steam wallet to make a purchase in a game (Elite Dangerous), since the game's website only had Steam Wallet listed as a purchase option and I was to lazy to find out how to use my card directly. I go to authorize the transaction, only to see that Steam was asking for additional funds because they were going to deduct $12.53 from my wallet, despite the purchase only being $9.56. It wasn't tax. The total said $9.59. But Steam was trying to take $3 extra. I wasn't willing to pay the extra $3, so I ended up just refunding the $10. I don't know where that extra $3 came in, so I'm a bit suspicious. It could be that there was some sort of deduction Steam made for something I wasn't aware of, but nothing of that sort was listed, which is bad practice imo.  #8203; Edit: For all you people saying that Elite doesn't have any purchases at that price: [https://imgur.com/a/xqnow1I](https://imgur.com/a/xqnow1I) Congratulations. You decided to talk trash without even knowing what you're talking about. (**Turns out I'm a hypocrite.)** Edited the total to be the actual value. I was off by three cents originally. Also edited the post to be less aggressive, since I was fairly annoyed when I made it.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>So, I picked up a boom time delivery mission to deliver 4000 or so insulating membranes to a surface installation. Grabbed my type-9, loaded up some of the cargo, flew over, landed, and found that there was no option to deliver. I confirmed I had the right cargo in my hold. I confirmed I was at the right station. I confirmed I'm playing Elite: Dangerous. I re-logged. I restarted the game. Nothing. I am entirely unable to complete this mission. Naturally, I'm now forced to abandon the mission. For which I'll be fined and lose reputation. Even though the mission is literally impossible. Did I just miss something, or did FD allow a mission-breaking bug to stay in the game in order to prove how dedicated they are to frustrating the ever-loving bajeezus out of me?

    <DATE>2020-05-10 02:26:09</DATE>
    <TEXT>Anyone else feel like this boss was poorly implemented? The arena has the rooms that are designed to counteract the hearing and seeing monkeys' senses, but they literally never go to them. They just stick to the rooftops and the tree, and *sometimes* the room with the drop from the roof. If you try to chase them into them, they'll just say "Fuck you!" and stick to those same areas, even if you try to position yourself to get them to move where you want. It feels like From spent all their time designing the arena, then half-assed the AI. I could see this boss *potentially* being a fun puzzle, but more often than not it's just frustrating. If From changed the AI to be easier to steer towards certain room, or just increased the likelihood of the monkeys moving towards their counter room, it'd actually be fun. I very much doubt that'll happen though. Also those terror monkeys can fling themselves into the void.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I'd say about half the orders I've put in have been missing items. I'm getting tired of it. I don't know if it's the restaurant or the driver's fault. My proposal? If an item is missing from your order, Uber pays to have it delivered separately. The driver gets paid for the order, but Uber should lose money. That, or you should be refunded the service fee as well as the cost of the missing item, again on Uber's dollar.</TEXT>

    <TITLE>Fake Sword Shrines Removed?</TITLE>
    <DATE>2020-05-18 04:36:01</DATE>
    <TEXT>I've been running worlds to try and get Terragrim, and I'm starting to think that fake sword shrines have been removed. I've had 15 sword shrines, all of which have dropped an enchanted sword. I don't think it's just luck, since getting that many in a row would be something like a 1 in 10,000,000 chance if the old spawn chances were still in place. There's no mention of any such change in the changelog though. Has anyone found a fake shrine?</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I've just been using map viewer to find shrines, and I've noticed that a lot of them spawn pretty deep underground and don't actually generate a shaft. It'd be pretty difficult to find them using just a solar eruption. That's assuming one is even generated at all. The majority of small worlds seem to spawn without one, and around a third of medium worlds. Most medium worlds have one shrine, occasionally two. On the bright side, fake shrines seem to have been removed. I've gotten 20 enchanted swords in a row.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Usually. I have found some where the actual shrine was visible from the surface. They stay mostly within the "surface" part on the depth meter, from what I can tell, although I think they can be a little below it. The depth from the surface to the shrine also seems to depend a lot on the elevation. Some worlds start like 100 blocks above the 0' surface mark, others start at like 150. I kinda suspect that might change how far down they are too.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I'm 60/40 on it. Allowing the deathray to go through blocks killed the arena strategy, which was my previous go to strat. On one hand, it kinda sucks because I always enjoyed decorating the arena, and it made for good farming, but on the other, having to fight him head-on is more engaging. My biggest issue is that the deathray can be pretty difficult to avoid without the RoD, and farming that is a pain.</TEXT>

    <TITLE>Legion Class Hall Dungeon Quests</TITLE>
    <DATE>2020-07-15 03:06:03</DATE>
    <TEXT>I got back into the game recently after taking a break in WoD. I started a rogue character. I'm really big on questing, so I'm trying to go through the Legion questlines, and unlock the hidden appearance for my weapon, before I move to BFA. I'm having a really big problem with this, though. I'm trying to use the dungeon finder, but even selecting the heroic and normal versions of the dungeons I need results in endless waiting in a queue. I've probably waited around eight hours since the last dungeon I got in, which was a two hour queue. I'm playing on Dalaran, as an Alliance toon. It's getting to the point that I'm getting genuinely frustrated, and I'm considering just dropping the game again. Every single time I try, I get all three DPS slots filled, and sometimes the tank slot, but I have to wait literal hours for a healer to be found. I literally watched through the entire Chernobyl mini-series without managing to get into a dungeon. Is there ANYTHING I can do, or am I just going to have to give up and move to BFA until I can solo at 120? If so, Blizzard seriously needs to remove the non-Pillar dungeon quests from Legion.</TEXT>

    <TITLE>Literally Impossible To Cancel Subscription</TITLE>
    <DATE>2020-07-24 21:35:57</DATE>
    <TEXT>So I made the massive mistake of getting Tinder Plus, and now that I'm trying to unsubscribe, I genuinely can't. I signed up with the direct debit method. There's no option to cancel on the app, despite looking. On the manage payment options screen, I'm shown my debit card, and an add a new card prompt, but nothing else. Tapping on my debit card has no effect. I have no subscriptions listed on Google Play. The web browser version tells me I need to cancel through Google Play or the native app, but again, there's no method to do so. I didn't receive a confirmation email of the charge, even after checking my spam folders and trash. I don't have Tinder emails blocked. I've followed every listed method of canceling, and found nothing. I can't even contact support, because I don't have the order number from the confirmation email. Should I just dispute the transaction through my bank, block all future attempts at charges, and report this to the FCC?</TEXT>

    <DATE>2020-08-20 03:09:46</DATE>
    <TEXT>Anyone else feel like this mission was designed by massive idiots? I had a similar experience when I played the original game. I got through the whole thing up to the final minute. I was doing fine, I had like two dozen ziggurat turrets ready, two infernals at each attack point, and a reserve army of abominations and frost wyrms. THEN the game decides to send DOZENS of enemy troops, all at once. There was way to organize my troops against that! I tried holding them off to at least delay them until the mission finished, but they immediately tore through my reserve army in about ten seconds, and trashed all of my ziggurats in twenty seconds. And this was on normal mode! So because I lost in the last TEN SECONDS, I have to redo the entire HALF HOUR mission. The game saves at certain points, but , you have to redo the whole thing, because fuck having fun. It was beyond frustrating to lose like that and have to redo the whole thing! I'm genuinely thinking of just stopping my play-through, because I don't want to deal with that again. Yeah, it makes it difficult, but it can be difficult in ways that are way more fun. Swarming the player doesn't fit the gameplay. The unit pathfinding can't handle that many moving obstacles. Sending in fewer, but more powerful units would work better. Or have a slower ramp up to the final attack instead of just throwing everything all at once. I apologize for the absolute mess that is this post, but I needed to vent to avoid face-desking and potentially giving myself a concussion. If anyone has good strategies for this mission that they'd like to share, I'd definitely appreciate it. Last time I played through I just wimped out and used cheat codes, but I'm not doing that this time through. Would a four-thick wall of ziggurats in front of the pathway to Kel'Thuzad work? Should I maximize troop numbers (I only had an upkeep of around 65)? Anyways, on a final note: FUCK</TEXT>

    <TITLE>Fire Needs A Nerf</TITLE>
    <DATE>2020-09-30 02:20:45</DATE>
    <TEXT>I accidentally left an oven on in a house I visited, which exploded and started a fire. The fire spread so much that it ended up burning down the majority of the West Point residential area. It somehow even spread on asphalt. It seems like the biggest issue is zombies. They catch on fire, but continue to walk around for a couple minutes, starting fires as they go. In areas with a decent amount of zombies, the fires can spread through an entire city. If there's a forest bordering the city, it may be possible for a decent chunk of the map to burn. Even using the Cheat Menu mod to extinguish fires with a brush tool, and using an infinite ammo M16 with level 10 aiming, I had a lot of difficulty containing the fire. With in-game tools, it would have been literally impossible. I had started out by giving myself fire extinguishers, and went through several dozen with little progress. It doesn't seem like good game design that you can lose an entire city on your world due to a single fire. There's no way to viably stop a fire that's started to spread. I think the developers may want to remove the fire spreading ability zombies have, and reduce the surfaces fire can spread over. It isn't particularly realistic even. Human bodies don't catch fire, and burning clothes wouldn't spread fire as much as it does in-game. Asphalt, snow, and brick shouldn't burn at all.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I've been playing Skyward Sword using my DS4 controller, and it works for the most part, but I am running into one mild annoyance.

I have the forward stab motion bound to a button, not the joystick, so I'm not sure what's causing this.

I haven't found a way to do it before the main menu, though, so you'll have to turn your mods off on the main menu first.
