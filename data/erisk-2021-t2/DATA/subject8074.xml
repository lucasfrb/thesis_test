    <TEXT>There's a cult or whatever they like to be called in my town, it's called Ramtha's School of Enlightenment. Their whole "compound" is like fenced and there's all sorts of security measures taken. I wanna know what they really do in there. I don't believe the wiki. I found a wiki link for more info if you're just wondering if I'm lying lol https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ramtha%27s_School_of_Enlightenment</TEXT>

    <TITLE>literally all my dreams are disturbing/frustrating and super vivid</TITLE>
    <DATE>2016-07-13 07:08:55</DATE>
    <TEXT>I dream frequently, about 5/7 days of the week. Every dream, I always get close to accomplishing some miscellaneous goal that I have in real life to have it ruined by someone or something. The other dreams involve disturbing situations, and I split them into 2 categories. The nightmares, and the lingeringdreams. Nightmares, pretty self explanatory, although they usually include ghosts or paranormal things. The lingering ones are dreams not immediately scary. When I wake up, I think back to the dream and it's just creepy or not right in some regard. All my dreams result in some sort of negative thing, whether I be scared, sad, or honestly traumatized. Idk. I never have good dreams anymore.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I dreamt that I was on Mt. Everest but it wasn't really like Mt. Everest, it was just a mountain. I guess I stopped at a place to camp and I got out of my car when the wind and snow just picked up to like hurricane force speeds in 1 second and I was thrown down the side and when I landed, I woke up and the parts of my body that I dreamed got hurt were actually in pain. It wasn't like bad but it was like maybe if u had hit urself really hard on something earlier and it was bruised and sore type of hurting. But the pain stopped after I was fully awake. I think it was a nervous system response to something that seemed legitimate. Or I'm getting beat up by my own brain.</TEXT>

    <TITLE>Overpopulation</TITLE>
    <DATE>2016-07-21 07:47:12</DATE>
    <TEXT>Man, everytime someone asks me about this topic, I give them straight out my opinion, and they're immediately think I'm fuckin Satan. Overpopulation, imo, is a real problem. All these people all across the world keep popping out children, despite them hardly being able to take care of the 4 others. All sorts of countries do this, you don't need that many kids if you are in poverty. It's called pulling out. And to those stupid charities trying to help raise funding for them, raise funding for birth control to help them out more. Here in just America there are so many people being selfish wanting to have kids of their own when you can adopt a child who needs a good stable home. But no, you create another being that's going to take up space and resources that wasn't necessary. Our world is already suffering from pollution and extinctions from humans. We're so smart yet we can't see that a simple solution to a lot of problems is stop fucking or stop making so many kids. Less people in the future can make a difference in the environment, the world can only hold so many of us. Don't get me wrong, I'm not saying exterminate the children like I'm some Hitler figure, I'm saying just quit having kids, especially impoverished countries. Its so much easier on yourself to just NOT. Don't be selfish. And if you already have kids, yes I may be calling you selfish. Why didn't you adopt? There could have been a kid you still loved and everything, but it had to be yours. Maybe we'll set a law everywhere like China did except not sexist. Limit one child until we're below 5 billion. Abortion could even be a viable option for some people that already messed up. Okay. Yeah call me Satan all you want, fucking Jessica and that group of people on Facebook. Face it, you know at least I'm making an educated guess that overpopulation=mass death if a disease breaks out or a famine or some shit.</TEXT>

    <TITLE>My sister's a pathological liar, and she's not an average 12 yr old.</TITLE>
    <DATE>2016-07-21 08:38:16</DATE>
    <TEXT>I'll be honest. I don't know why she does these things, it's not serious now but it could be in the future. She'll always take like a bag of chips from the pantry and hide them, if I ask where they are, she says idk. She steals my toothbrushes, and my lip rings and she doesn't even have a piercing. She's stolen a lot of pencils, paper, just small things. Things that shouldn't matter, like why couldn't she just ask? It's not like I'm the scary always say no type. I'm quite nice considering how she treats our family. She's only 12 and she lies about every little thing. I mean, idk if she can't help it or wants attention. My parents dont believe me when I say what she does, even when I have definitive proof that my thing is in her room or I don't have have it. They always say oh she doesn't steal anymore, she doesn't lie anymore. Well stop letting your emotions get in the way and look at the evidence. Eventually it could be actual shoplifting, maybe even further, who knows?! And she takes stuff from my parents too but they just assume they lost it or misplaced it. They won't even get her help like a therapist. What am I supposed to do anymore. Now I'm 17 so I hardly have the authority to get her help. Another thing is she's obsessed with sex. I get it, 12 yr olds are anyways and the times are changing. But I'm not lying, maybe 8 hours of every day ik she's masturbating. Let's just say the walls are thinner than she thinks they are. Plus my mom just accepts it. at least tell her to slow down and maybe go outside for once. She's catfished boys much older than her, one was 16 and who knows who else she's done it to. She's also in her emo phase, well kinda. She copied it from me cuz I look like an emo kid. Even tho I don't act like one, she must have googled emo or something cuz she started acting like a legit stereotype. She even made me cut her hair like mine. After I was diagnosed with clinical depression, she thought a few months later to try and pull the same card, and she cut herself for attention. But like a month later she was over it. She's so disrespectful to everyone too. I could ask her a simple question or nicely tell her what chore she needs to today and no joke she'll reply with something along the lines of "shut up" or "I knoWWWW." My mom gets mad cuz I treat her like she treats me sometimes but trust me I've tried being the nice one and it gets the same response either way. All this stuff has been happening for at least a year, and it's still progressing. So rip my life and tries to help. I'm done with these petty nuisances. This probably turned more into rant, I'm sorry. Thanks for reading if u got this far.</TEXT>

    <TITLE>My parents take their anger out on me.</TITLE>
    <DATE>2016-07-22 03:16:34</DATE>
    <TEXT>My family situation isn't bad, but it's not great. My parents work 40 hours a week wed-sat. Stupid schedule, inconvenient af. My mom leaves notes for my sister, like what chores or whatever else to do that day. Most of the time, I'll do it. I have ocd so sometimes stuff like taking out the trash or doing dishes even with gloves on makes me wanna scrub my entire body's skin off. I ususally end up scrubbing my hands until they're beet red. But I do it anyway cuz she'll throw a conniption fit. My sister doesn't do half the things I do. Especially the things that really stir up my ocd. When my mom comes home expecting my sister's chores to be done, I'm usually the culprit to take the brunt of her anger. I don't know if my sister has done her chores. I would do them for her, but I don't want to show her that someone's always gonna be there to pick up your responsibilities. She stays in her room and only comes out for food or to use the bathroom. I'm always helping with dinner, groceries, feeding animals, all that stuff. But my mom doesn't yell at her at all. She only yells at me, because I'm the one she sees. It's really not fair and I'm kinda done with it. I don't like to backtalk to her, but today I pointed it out and she got more mad cuz she knew I was right. "I'm gonna slap her smart ass mouth, she's always blaming her sister." I'm not, for the record. It's not my fault that it's actually her not doing her job. I feel like getting yelled at and put down saying I don't do anything is wrong when I'm the one who's there at the end of the day to help you, mom. Can't you see that?</TEXT>

I have a lot of time left but kids my age are all out having fun with their friends and I can't really do anything because all my friends are online since I moved about 700 miles a few months ago. I just sit at home 6 days of the week and go grocery shopping or out for a random drive on Sunday. The internet is what keeps me sane. I feel like I should be doing something productive like getting a job or finding a summer class/club but there are none, because I live 10 miles from the nearest town in the middle of the forest. I feel like it's even too much to ask to go find a hiking trail or quiet stream to spend a day with my parents on their day off. I don't want to go by myself and my sister won't go. I feel trapped with nothing to do but waste my life away reading memes and stupid political battles. I only have a tiny laptop that barely runs the internet for things like writing stories and keeping contact with the outside world. When the internet isn't down because the rain will make the signal die. Edit: I just realized how pathetic and first world problem this sounds.</TEXT>

    <TITLE>My friend and I teleported, I swear to god.</TITLE>
    <DATE>2016-07-28 05:48:03</DATE>
    <TEXT>Okay so like a few years ago, my friend came over to my house and we got bored. I used to live on a desert ranch style place, with maybe 100-150 acres of land owned by the local farmers for their cattle in the rural southern az desert. It was dangerous to be out there cuz illegal immigrants came thru often and so much of the wildlife was active around there because we kept a small pond of water for them. Anyway, we decided that we would go exploring, and we passed our barb wire fence into the desert. We walked a while until we found a medium sized wash. I recognized the place and I knew that there was a pond if we followed it maybe a quarter of a mile down. We walked down it for a while, making sure it wasn't gonna rain do we wouldn't die. This wash led out to a pretty huge retention pond, probably naturally formed. There was a small hill surrounding the whole pond, so it was like we were in a bowl. We could see the hill from our house, so I went with my dad to explore it. We went over the hill and found the pond, so I was familiar with the whole area surrounding it. My friend played around in the mud a while and I searched for anything cool. We decided to start heading back home, and I just figured we would go the same way that my dad and I went back. The scenery hadn't changed much except the pond had gotten lower, so I knew where I was going. There was a small part of the hill considerably easier to climb next to a huge joshua tree, so that's how I knew it was the same way my dad went too. We got to the top of the hill and I could see the roof of my house. I knew the direction was the southwest because of some moutains we lived right next to, so my sense of direction wasn't bad at all. My friend and I ran straight down the hill towards the house. Which is when I think we shifted somehow. I looked at the ground to prevent falling, and so did my friend, and we held hands to help balance because there were spiky plants I didn't fancy falling into. When I looked up, we weren't at the base of the hill. I turned around to see if my friend made it, and there wasn't a hill behind us. We were in a flat place of the desert, and the pond was almost a half mile away, to about the east because tons of groups of trees grew around it and I could see them. I didn't know where I was at first, but I didn't wanna scare my friend cuz she was already a little bit scared to be so far out. But then to my left I recognized some old wore down telephone poles along a small dirt path that would lead back to our property. We were also on the other side of the wash. The hill was on the side that my house was on, let's say the left side if you faced towards the pond. We were now on the right. Once I knew I could find my way home, I recalled to my friend. She said she didn't notice feeling anything but she definitely did realize that the pond was away. She also pointed out the house was further away, and she was right. Also, the house was pointed more north than when we were on the hill. It was such a strange experience because to this day I can't explain it. If anyone wants to know more, I can leave a screenshot of Google maps of this pond and the area surrounding it and my old house.</TEXT>

I'll text or message friends when I wanna talk but I won't get replies until a few hours later. When I get into a talkative mood, which is rarely, I'll just come on here and spew some stuff over in r/randomthoughts or here when I just feel like crap sometimes.

    <TITLE>My coca cola kept disappearing</TITLE>
    <DATE>2016-07-28 23:38:08</DATE>
    <TEXT>I vividly remember this experience because it just seemed dumb back then. It was a while ago, a few years, and we lived in a tiny trailer, like the rv type with the small table downstairs and then a loft thing with the bed and a small closet. My mom and I were the only ones home. I opened a can of coca cola, took a drink, and sat it on the little table. I went back up into the loft area and read a few pages of my book. When I went down again, it was gone. I just figured my mom thought I wasted it so she drank it for herself, no big deal. So I got another one and opened it, repeat the process. I go back up, little bit later I go down and it's gone again. I'm kind of annoyed so I ask my mom where she put it, and she said she didn't touch any soda. So I'm like wth okay I guess. I let it go and opened another one. Same thing again. This time, I yelled at my mom stop playing tricks on me, where's my damn coke. She yells back that she didn't touch it, and since she was the only one there I still didn't believe her because it happens THREE TIMES. Eventually I gave up and started thinking about it, she really didn't do anything with them since she doesn't even like coke. I just took it as a sign that the universe didn't want me to drink it. I haven't thought about this until I found this subreddit and it makes sense that it could have been a glitch. The point of me mentioning the small trailer is that I know I didn't misplace it because there was only 1 table. And there was no one except my mom there with me at that time, because it was so small that I would notice. I think it was a glitch, a very annoying one at that.</TEXT>

    <DATE>2016-07-29 02:19:42</DATE>
    <TEXT>Now i know someone out there will say "then just go outside and walk" but that's not what I'm talking about. I live in rural washington near a relatively small town. Convenient for wanting to see nature, but it's a small drive before u get into the real stuff. I crave to go fishing in a secluded lake way out there, I wanna just walk a trail with no worries, have a forest in my backyard that's accessible instead of fenced off. I want a quiet place to sit and rest, a cool place to explore. I'd walk to one but it's all too far yet at the tip of my fingers. I'm 17 and don't have a car or friends to go with. My parents work too often and don't fancy going out and doing those things. Also, a lot of places I wanna go take small hikes or walks and they aren't up for that. I just want to go out and feel like a part of nature. I live near the base of mt rainier so I'm always wanting to take a trip up there and play in the snow despite it being almost august, I wanna swim in the cold ass rivers without other people being there. Just a remote but safe place. Damn nature. Why tf are u so cruel, letting me see you but letting nasty ass college students take the peaceful spots to drink, snort xanax, and have sex at. Fuck you, ruining my time trying have fun and relieve stress when you could do that shit somewhere else. I'm so tired of only being able to sit inside on the internet wasting time when I could be having fun and exercising without the public eye. Nature is fuckin free. Nature doesn't judge me cuz I look like a fat emo slob. I don't have to pay like I do shopping or with whatever else is in town, and pay with humiliation because just walking around town by myself sucks. I wish I lived a little further from town or near a good obscure park so I didnt have to deal with rude other ppl. When I get older, I'm saving money to buy a small national park and keep it just for my fucking self.</TEXT>

    <DATE>2016-07-31 07:53:29</DATE>
    <TEXT>I want a lot of things. Not very expensive things, but things that are still a considerable amount of money. Both my parents work full time and we're hanging on alright now. Maybe the odd piece of furniture from goodwill or a suit of clothes from wherever are in the books, but as soon as it comes to something I want, it's always too much. However, they'll spend hundreds a month on alcohol, medical marijuana, and fucking cigarettes. Like I can't count how many times I've pointed out how much money we could save if they slowed down a little bit on that. But no, just cuz I'm the kid they can't take wise advice. That's a whole different rant tho. I really want a dirt bike. I've wanted one for fucking years, and it seems so dumb and petty for me to want one. Ive had one stupid broken atv that sucked asshole that my dad let rot away because he wouldn't fix it. Yeah I shud be grateful but honestly it was shit. All I wanted was a dirt bike. Ever since I was like 10 i wanted one. It's so fun just to ride and even tho I can barely ride, that doesn't make it any less fun for me. Every one always complains that I don't go outside, maybe it's because I don't have anything to do outside but walk around with my thumb up my ass. It's like $3000 for a decent one I could ride. Not even that much compared to like what other kids are wanting, cars and shit. But it always no. At one point it was because we didn't have enough money, but now we do. Now it's I'll hurt myself, that's dumb, u have nothing/nobody to ride with. Even if I made my own money to buy it, they wouldn't take me. Maybe it's because when I was younger my dad really almost killed himself being retarded on one trying to be a fucking enduro rider or some shit. I'm not gonna go out and fly 40mph over a rocky ass hill, I'm fine putting around on trails, ok? Before, I used to ride my cousins bikes but that was rare because he was stingy or some shit. I've only ridden a real dirt bike maybe 10 times, but those 10 times have made me crave it all these years. Like a fucking coke addiction. I wanna ride my own so bad, knowing I can go outside for a reason besides dicking my fat ass around. Yeah that's another reason, why have a bicycle when I'm fat af and ppl will judge me when I can at least look kinda cool on a dirt bike instead. I don't think it's such a hard compliance. I want to go out, be active, hey maybe I even have an actual talent for it. Guess we'll never fucking know.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>They aren't bad. But they are fucking bad at the same time. They're like 12-15 doing very sexual things and shit. Like its the argument about "where are your parents?" They could still make money without singing about fuckin and grinding. They're full of themselves. They're good looking and they know it. But that's what makes them ugly. Conceited little bastards. They are just kids, so they don't know what they're doing is probably gonna mess up their life, even if they're financially set. I hate the fuckboys on there, the little girls showing ass and tits.

    <TITLE>Headphone duplication glitch</TITLE>
    <DATE>2016-08-05 05:21:36</DATE>
    <TEXT>I have these red headphones I got from family dollar before I moved to where there aren't any family dollars. I used them for a long time until the left speaker blew out and I put them on my table and they were there for a while. One day I walk past my uncles office and notice them sitting next to his trashcan. I decided to grab them back since it looked like he was gonna borrow them and threw them away after he figured out it was half broken. I went to put them back on my table because I could have used them as backup and didn't wanna throw them away. But there was the other pair still there. I figured oh he prolly just bought the same ones I have. But I remembered I bought them like a year ago at a store that we don't have in like a 100 mile radius. I doubt he'd get $5 headphones off the internet, too. Seeing as it was weird af, I plugged them into my phone and played a song. The left was broken. I then tested out the other pair that was originally on my table. Left broken. I decided to put it with my other pair. The next morning the pair I had found in his room was gone, so I asked my uncle if he took them. He said he'd borrowed the ones off my table since I never used them but they didn't work on one of the sides so he was gonna recycle them. He didn't take it after I found it. I could only come up with it must've been extreme coincidence like it was the same headphone batch with defective left ears, but that's super unlikely if we don't have family dollar here and I bought them so long ago. Plus he said he'd borrowed them from the table. If it wasn't a glitch, idk.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>He's pretty old. I got him from the shelter. He was in there a while. He wasn't the one I originally went to get. An old lady took the one I was on the way for literally right before I got there. But I'm glad it happened. I love my kitty so much. No one would have adopted him, I think. He's all black, so there's that. But when he was in the shelter, he was so scared and skittish. He only wanted to hide and he didn't like to be held. He had been in there months. He was discounted because he was older, but no one even looked at him when I was there because other cats were meowing and sticking paws through cages and he was just under the little blanket staying silent. I decided to give him a chance. I took him home, and he hid under my bed for actually a week. I had to push food/water under for him and he'd come out while it was quiet at night to go to the bathroom. Eventually, he started letting me pet him but any quick movement he ran back under the bed. But I gave him time and love, he must have been abused and scared of open spaces because of being in the cage so long. Now, he's the sweetest cat. He sleeps on my bed all day, which I love because I like having company :) and he'll meow in my ear when he wants some love. Lol he'll only meow to me though and doesn't let my mom, dad, or sister pick him up like he'll let me. But he trusts us now. I'm so glad I chose him. Something made me choose him, and I'm glad that I gave him the chance he deserved. Now he can live happily with us for the rest of his life instead of in a cage or an abusive home.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Man. This was a pretty good book. The ending was definitely not what I expected. I thought momo just gave him some sort of information that he was abra's uncle, not that she gave him her steam to use against the true knot. Momo was probably my favorite character. I found myself disliking Lucy tho. I know she's her mom, but when abra was with dan fighting them, she needed to trust her daughter instead of trying to just be defensive over her body. Dave was the one I ended up liking lol. But jeez did Dan come out much better than I expected. When he saw the flies on his face, I was so done, I thought he was actually gonna die. I'm glad it ended up being momo's steam instead. Fuck the true knot.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>It's like 1 am, I wanna get some good rest, and my 12 yr old sister is awake and banging, laughing, screaming, slamming, music blaring, youtubers screaming, video game noises, stomping, talking on the phone, it never ends, man idk what she's doing. But I figure she'll calm down and even tho my door is shut it's still loud and annoying as fuck. Plus her door has weird weather stripping around it that sticks to the door when she opens it and makes a sound like a cracking whip times 3. Yeah it's that loud, because she keeps her door shut 12 hours a day and when she finally opens it it's real stuck and she must body slam it open despite it being midnight and it scares the shit out of me. And when I'm finally drifting off she'll do that shit, not even being remotely polite of everyone else in the house, just BAM. It jerks me awake immediately. My mom doesnt care, dad sleeps like a log. I mean, not like I needed sleep anyway when I have reddit. Fuck. Can't she be quiet like one night?</TEXT>

    <TITLE>17/F Idk the word for what I feel about any relationships. nsfw probably</TITLE>
    <DATE>2016-08-12 09:51:56</DATE>
    <TEXT>Very long story, but I'll take the time to finally admit this somewhere. Kinda 2 stories, but closely related. They're need to know before anyone can understand what I'm trying to explain, I think. When I was in 9th grade, the only boy I ever liked was 17 and I was 14. He was the first guy that ever treated me nicely like I mattered, plus he was also the first guy that had a lot in common with me. I liked him a lot. He used me. He used a lot of girls. I went to his house to play video games, truly innocently enough, and he wanted to touch me, but I wouldn't let him at first. I only let him touch my boobs, which I liked. Stuff happened. I gave him a bj. I didn't even kiss him. Never kissed anyone, even now. I regret it so much. But I liked him and I wanted him to like me back. I thought he did. My mom came to get me from his house, which stopped everything. I'm glad it did. I got home and asked him if he'd be my boyfriend. He said he only liked older girls. I was confused. He let me do that, and he did that to me, but he didn't want to date me. Red flag. But I didn't stop talking and flirting with him because I liked him too much, I think he was my first love. Sadly wasted. Then I saw him get with other girls and start to ignore me. Over the summer I kinda lost contact with him but saw him at school. It was a very small school so I saw him every day. Eventually we just didn't talk unless I approached him. He always had a girl to mess with. Always. It hurt but eventually I got over it since I realized he was an actual fuckboy. Next thing. 10th grade, I made 2 best friends. A guy, (lets say R) who I completely didn't think anything more than a best friend of. And then a girl, (lets say V) who didn't have any friends irl and I became her first true friend. Me and V hung out all the time and I'd always ask R for advice and make dude jokes with since I'm kinda a tomboy. One day, V admits she likes this guy and he rejects her. This guy just didnt want a relationship, I knew him for awhile. It wasn't personal. But V took it too hard. She rebounded. A few days after she was rejected, R comes out and says he has liked V for a while. I'm shocked. He's never shown any interest in her, vice versa. They just don't go together. I'm kinda like oh it's just a lil thing. Three days later, they're fucking dating. I was in denial. I was thinking he used her rebound to his advantage and she was settling for what she could get. We three were all dealing with types of loneliness I guess you could say. I looked to V for relatable feelings and support, and looked to R for things to get my mind off stuff. But once they got together, they only looked to each other. I panicked because I knew they'd forget me. They were my only rocks, I guess you could say. And I told them that they couldn't forget me and they promised they wouldn't. Lies. They got together and I didn't exist in their eyes anymore. I was just there. And it hurt so much, because they both called me their best friend. Each of them did. I became a third wheel, and I no longer had anyone to talk to because talking to V separately, she'd just be like oh he makes me happy, I don't feel alone anymore, and R was scared that V would 've jealous if he talked to me and didn't share what I said. (Completely different story). But anyways, I was left completely alone and it hurt. I was V's first irl friend and R was my friend for so long. They'd make out in front of me. Every day. I'd mention it makes me uncomfortable, and they'd stop but I could see they were annoyed. So I'd try to stay away, but V would say I was "becoming distant." So I'd stick around anyway. Maybe I don't wanna see you throatfuck and ignore me. Anyway, I asked them once nicely if they could wait to kiss. After like a month of having to sit there awkwardly with just them. Every. Day. V rudely replies no, we're gonna do what we want, when we want. And that was the end pretty much, sparing all the details and me trying to fix it after. I felt so horrible. They betrayed me so much. After that, the relationship went downhill even faster than it was before. I kinda felt bad for R. He tried to be my friend. But he couldn't because she had him pussywhipped. My clinical depression started to get real bad at this point now that I had no friends to rely on, them becoming truly hostile to me. I almost killed myself over this stupid shit. She made me seem like the bad guy because I asked them not to kiss in front of me, like I asked them to drop a fucking child off a bridge. Really. I was the one trying to fix stuff in a democratic manner but V was the one that was attacking me. We didn't talk that summer. She told me to drop her. I did, even though it hurt so much. I loved her like a sister, and R had to go since he was at her whims. Every relationship experience I've had is documented here. First guy used me completely. The second experience my two best friends got together out of lust and selfishness and left me suicidal with no one. So, to say the least, I fucking hate relationships. It's irrational, but if I see some kids together just walking hand in hand, I'm disgusted. My parents peck each other on the cheek, I'm disgusted. Kids on the bus talk about a first date experience really loud so others purposefully hear, I have irrational anger towards them. PDA really sets me off. I can't handle it. I think I need therapy for it. Just writing here has helped, I've never told anyone this. It makes me wanna yell and scream at them that it's meaningless, it's for nothing, you're nasty individuals who are selfish and don't care. Even though I know that's not always true. I can't help it. I fucking hate couples unrequitably. I hate people who talk about it. I hate it in general. I always see third wheels, who obviously are in the same boat I was once, except probably a lesser degree, and people who forget everything to be with an SO deserve to have nothing to go back to once they realize that it was lust and stupid emotions. I hate it. I loathe it. I've also never seen anyone else attractive after that boy used me. No one since. Not that anyone finds me attractive anyways, which I'm glad for, for now. I don't want any relationships until I'm well matured when I'm not going to get so infatuated that I neglect the others that have been there far longer. I'm trying to overcome this. But I wanna know if anyone else out there feels like this. Please, I'm tired of feeling wrong. Tl;dr: relationship experiences that aren't even my own caused an undefined irrational hatred for any type of relationship I see</TEXT>

    <DATE>2016-08-19 02:09:58</DATE>
    <TEXT>Somehow I've landed with the responsibility of doing every chore every day or getting yelled at. It was my sister's turn to do the fucking dishes today, but she doesn't come out of her room unless it's to get food or go to the bathroom. Then she acts like it's me not doing my chores. And lies and says she's done something 3 days in a row. Bullshit. I've been here and you don't even come out of your room until 4 pm. And by then you don't even do shit. Then my mom gets onto me and says she's gonna take my phone away for 2 weeks because there was dishes in the sink. This is my only communication to the outside, I'm already depressed and without my phone, that'd be a contrivance to off myself. I even directly told my mom that she isn't doing shit and she shrugs it off and never yells at her. It's always me. Always. Always, every day she gets off work ALWAYS ALWAYS ALWAYS FUCKING ALWAYS. IM SICK OF IT. Maybe if she'd ask me nicely to do it instead of yelling or actually make my sister do it, I'd be fine. It's not fucking fair. I have ocd that makes me wanna wash my hands until my skin comes off when I touch something like a public doorknob, let alone dirty dishes and trash. And she won't get me gloves. I know it's not gonna kill me but I don't have lotion to support the habit of me drying my hands out so much from washing them cuz I'm stuck with the shit chores my sister won't Fucking do and pawns off on me. They're cracked and callused so bad. Btw the dishes aren't even mine except maybe one plate and a fork or cup. And here I am cleaning for five, dishes piled past the top of the sink just from last nights dinner. I physically gag everytime I have to touch them and my sister knows that. Yet she can't even take literally 5 minutes to help me. Fuck off. Next time you want something, I'm saying no because that's what you deserve.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I swear. I've already been having a hard time but today is really pushing it. I want to jump off the bridge near my house. I was even out the door walking but when I stepped out the door the phone rang and it was my mom. Someone let my dog out the back door and I can't find him. My mom is gonna be so mad or upset when she comes home and he isn't here or he's ran over. This part seems retarded but it's another thing pushing me. My cat threw up on my blanket and the washer is broken and I don't know how to work it, and my sister won't help me. She won't help me at all. Yesterday I cleaned everything in the house thoroughly. Yet I ask her to clean another pile of throw up, one pile, and she says "no I'm not doing it," and goes back into her room to have phone sex. I'm so done with this life. Everything falls back on me and I'm finally at breaking point. I can't even get the motivation to stop crying right now. The only reason I'm able to be collected and calm is because I want this feeling to pass but idk if it's going to today. I can't bring myself out of it because that throw up is everywhere, my sister is fucking useless, and I can only imagine my dog dead in the road because I couldn't catch him in time.</TEXT>

    <DATE>2016-08-21 03:44:07</DATE>
    <TEXT>So this dream wasn't scary at the time, but when I thought about it, it disturbs me and I'm not sure why. First, it started with me and I was exploring alone. I crossed like a tiny gorge with one big doorstep and walked a little ways over a hill. Then I saw this gigantic crater and in the dream I was freaked out cuz I never noticed it before. Except it wasn't a normal crater, it looked kind of like a mine with the twisty path that goes around and down. So I followed the road to the bottom, and there was a pool of water about 15 feet across and maybe 20 feet deep with the bomb at the bottom. I decided to swim down and go to see it closer and found a radiation suit to swim down to it. I somehow feel the radiation coming from it and it's weird. I'm more confused than freaked out now. As I get back to the top of the crater, I decide to go home and get someone to show it to. I woke up. The next night, the dream kinda resumed on its own. I was walking back towards it with 5 or so people that I didn't know. When we were crossing the little gorge that time, there was raging waters and some people got stuck in the mud but we got out. As soon as I started coming over the hill, I got excited because I could show them what I saw. As soon as it would have came into view, I woke up. I was so angry. The next night, that same section repeated itself. Again, I was angry. Not sure why, but this dream still creeps me out and I always think about it when I think of dreams.</TEXT>

    <TITLE>Been counting calories, exercising vigorously 6 months. Only lost 10 lbs. F/16</TITLE>
    <DATE>2016-08-22 19:15:50</DATE>
    <TEXT>Im only 16 and decided to try to lose some weight. I'm current around 200-210 and I'm 5'5". The last 6 months, every day I eat around 1500 calories or sometimes less. I don't drink soda and I don't eat any fast food and cut lots of fried foods and junk, so they shouldn't be a huge impact. The worst I've ate I can think of is potatoes and that's maybe 4 times a month that my mom makes them. About two months ago, I got a nutritionist and he said I was eating very very well for the excercise I was doing and everything. I exercise 3-5 days a week, pilates or jog/run, or weight training for about 20-30 minutes. It's been hell because I only lost 10 lbs from ALL THIS. I have hypothyroidism that I've inherited from my mom and dad's side. I was diagnosed at age 10 and ever since I've been on a synthetic thyroid medicine. (For anyone who doesn't know, it slows your metabolism and makes your body pretty much run slower I guess you can say) The doctors said it shouldn't be that big of an impact but I think it is. I've done everything a normal functioning body would do to lose weight and it's just not working for me. It's been hard for me not to starve myself of become bulemic because of how frustrating it's been. So I came here to see if anyone could help me or give me some advice that could work.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I posted here on reddit on a weightloss thread because I'm fat, been working out and dieting 6 months, and only lost 10 lbs. I put everything that ik down for stuff I was doing. I wanted advice on what was wrong with me, but all they could point out was that I needed a fucking food scale. I don't fucking need a food scale. All the meals I eat are fucking measured to know what the serving size is. I even eat some prepackaged meals that I let my nutritionist coordinate so. I know goddamn good and well that he isn't fuckin it up. I wanted real help or another diet proven to work for someone that has my problems, not just be told the only thug making the difference is a MOTHERFUCKING FOOD SCALE. EVEN MY FUCKING NUTRITION GUY, WHO IS THE PROFESSIONAL HERE, SAID THAT MY LOG LOOKED ACCURATE ENOUGH TO BE ON PAR WITH ONE AND THAT I DIDNT HAVE TO HAVE IT</TEXT>

    <TITLE>People who pretend to be depressed for attention and try to one up each other.</TITLE>
    <DATE>2016-08-24 23:02:02</DATE>
    <TEXT>I imagine someone out there knows what I'm talking about. I'll admit my group of friends aren't the greatest. Well, more acquaintances after I heard this conversation between them. I don't remember exactly all the words because I was kinda in a fit, but I'll summarize. One friend says, "Yeah I cut again last night. I didn't think I was gonna live." Other friend, "Dude wow, that's nothing. One time I passed out and no one even knew." "Pfft. No one even cares that I cut, like I could die and they wouldn't know." "No one would care enough to move my body or something until I stunk up the building." That's when I walked away, they were still talking after but I don't even wanna know what they said. Yeah. They were casually talking about this shit. Like it was a game. Trying to one up each other. I try not to judge when someone says they have a mental disorder or illness because you never know. But I've known these two girls for about 4 years and they're only attention seekers. Multiple instances before, they've done other things and had other methods for getting attention. Like rape allegations, making up that their dad has beaten them, (he hasnt, I've been to their house multiple times and he is the nicest person. Wouldn't lay a hand on a child. One of them fell off her bike and told me to say her dad gave her the bruise. Idk why I didn't break it off there.) And also cases of lying. Maybe they do have a mental disorder. But depression isnt one of them. They aren't the only people I've seen doing this. Online is a cesspool of it. The whole angsty teen thing in middle school is happening with this too. My sister has fallen into this sick trend. She only decided to "cut" herself and say she was depressed after I had gotten real psychiatric help for my clinical depression. And she's fine now. So it was a ploy for attention. I never cut. But she did like as I mentioned, to one up me. It makes me sick. I don't understand why. If you're that desperate, you need real help. One day, you could actually kill yourself as a mistake, taking this too far. You're putting a bad stigma around kids who have this. Around everyone. And it's not fair.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I remember when I first went to therapy, my therapist told my mom never ask what's wrong. But she always does. She assumed because I didn't feel depressed for a few months that my clinical depression has gone away. It hasn't. She gets frustrated at me that I can't be happy or pretend to. I'm sorry. It's not my fault. Don't ask me what's wrong because nothing really is. It's just my brain being stupid. How am I going to explain this to you. So you can just say stop being selfish. Oh you're just an emotional teenager. Alright. It's taking every ounce of willpower for me to function. I'm really done this time. I want to shut down and never get back up.</TEXT>

    <DATE>2016-08-31 19:14:22</DATE>
    <TEXT>Tl;dr Friends mom abuses her but I can't help Let's call her Mia. She's been my only physical friend, meaning that I can see her and she isn't a talk online only friend, since I moved to Washington a year ago. I'm just a picky person with who I hang out with. And I want to help her but I can't. I'm only 17 so that doesn't help. Mia's mom adopted her when she was 12. She has a biological daughter as well, who she treats much better than she treats my friend. Exponentially better. Once, when I went to their house, I experienced a little taste of that. I only went to their house once because the feeling that family gave me was terrifying. I didn't take my shoes off at the door and I got death stares. They're also "religious." Meaning they want to be holy in the eyes of God. But they're all hypocrites, they'll be doing extremely fucked up things but say that others are going to hell and need to repent. Anyway, Mia's mom abuses her. Not physically, but mentally. Real bad, like every day type stuff. But in Washington, it's legal to practically abuse your kid as long as you don't leave a mark, according to what the cop I talked to said. Mia messages me and I have to tell her everything is alright. She has depression and has self harmed. Today, her mom said go downstairs and be the girl that cuts herself. She has said this before. Just because my friend had doodled on a piece of paper that was laying on the table, she smacked her in the head and called her disrespectful. Almost constantly, Mia's mom is taking away her phone for some stupid reason. Unfair reason. She makes her do all the chores, even while the biological daughter doesn't do anything. She's taken her biological daughter shopping for school supplies and clothes, but told Mia that she has to deal with what she has still. There are millions of incidents like this that I'd say constitute as mental and emotional abuse but I won't go into them for the sake of length. Mia isn't a bad kid. She has problems that could be solved if her mom didn't treat her like a heathen. She's actually really respectful to her mom even in the face of her abuse. She messaged today that she was going to kill herself it's gotten so bad. I want to help her, but everything I've done or she's done has been thrown out the window. Like I said, I've called the cops and they said nothing. She's called the cops. She's told councillors. But her mom is such a conniving, manipulating fuck that can turn it around in any situation to make Mia look like the bad person. To make ME seem like the bad person. Since Mia is adopted, I tried to tell her wait 2 more years until she was 18 to move out and it'll get better. But right now, week by week, it's been getting so bad by the end of these 2 years she could be so fucked up that no one can help her. And since she is adopted, except its a legal guardianship instead of becoming a parent. Her mom just wanted that money that comes with it, and now it's stopped, she doesn't want Mia anymore. That's my theory. But since it is a legal guardianship, it takes a whole lot of money to terminate that. More than they have, and Mia has gone through it before but things always fail and she ends up right back at "home." Mia also doesn't want to have to go into foster care at 16. People don't want to adopt kids that old. And plus I'm kinda her only friend too, and being put into foster care would bring us out of touch. We both don't want that, even if the stupid plans went through instead of getting revoked like before. So I don't know how to help her. Every effort on both of our parts have been foiled. I even told my mom and she couldn't help. It seems hopeless at this point. It hurts to see Mia this way and be useless towards getting her to a safe, happy place that isn't gotten to by suicide. It seems like her mom is using her for all the hate she has for everyone, blaming Mia for all the problems saying she needs to repent. At first, I thought Mia was just being a rebellious teenager. Like "I hate my mom, she sucks, she wouldn't let me go to a party" type thing. But after a while, I saw that no, it wasn't like that but it was real. Real abuse that no one has tried to stop. It's a fucked up world when you can't even help a kid who needs a new home.</TEXT>

But the week before he died, I had the strangest dream about him. I was on a beach and it was some weird remote lake. He came in tied to the front of a big-ish boat, and was singing. I can't remember what, but I know that in my dream, I was singing along. Then the boat crashed the front into the beach and he was just gone. I woke up. It was so weird since I dreamed practically that he died when I didn't have any reason to dream about him. Then the next week I was shocked to hear it.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>There are so many questions I have. So I have a class fee of $10, no problem. However they have all the payments go thru this thing called asb. And I have no clue what that means. Like I know in general you go there to pay for yearbooks and tickets and stuff, but I need this asb sticker and idk where to get one. And it's important that I pay this fee. And im not sure but I think my ap lit teacher gave me the wrong book for this summer work I was supposed to do. #1 I was supposed to get an assignment over the summer to do but the school mailed it to the wrong address so I couldnt do it and never got it until now, which is too late. But now I have one week to read this book, and idek if it's the right one or if it's for another thing. It's not hard to ask her but like it is at the same time because it's more to worry about and an inconvenience. I might arrange a meeting with a councillor just to ask a barrage of questions. It pisses me off that this medium size school has too many kids in it already, about 1500 when max would be 800. And they still manage to fuck this shit up when getting it right is priority. In high school ik you're supposed to take charge n shit but when it's like your thrown to the wolves in a brand new school, they expect you to know everything you're supposed to do when you don't. I expect to just go to class and certify everything on my end is good, not have to waste the little time I have as it is on fucking chasing around people that didn't get their shit done right.</TEXT>

    <DATE>2016-09-18 02:19:43</DATE>
    <TEXT>I'm a really nice person, but when it comes to one thing, I could probably kill myself it makes me so mad. Before anyone jumps to a conclusion, I'm not that spoiled or rebellious. But please hear me out. I instantly get mad when my mom tells me to do something. It's not the fact that she's telling me to do it, it's the tone of voice. She sounds like she's getting on to me and making me seem like I'm worthless and only made to answer to her every whim. And she'll yell at me for no reason. Say I didn't just take out the trash because I had homework to do before she got home or I didn't do the dishes because I was busy. Well oh my fucking god, must be the end of the world. It makes me so mad. More mad than any other thing. It takes everything for me not to yell or throw things. Today she did it to me because I didn't do the dishes. I haven't been in the kitchen all day. I've been in bed with one of the worst migraines of this month. And she knows I hate the dishes. Touching the food that wasn't mine triggers my old ocd and makes me wanna shave my hands off. The sad part being I'm not exaggerating. She comes home and instantly uses that accusatory tone with me, "Do the dishes, you know better than that." You know what mom, no I don't. She's only acting all big and assertive because we have a family member staying here. And before you would do the dishes on your own and let me rest on my weekends. I have school, and a part time volunteering job. She has to act like that since she's trying to put up a show for the family living here temporarily. Well this made me instantly angry. I had to wait until she was out of the doorway and I instantly started just wailing and punching on my thighs. On impulse. I'm not one for self harm at all. I couldn't stop myself. My thighs are all bruised now and I regret it. All that anger had to go somewhere. I only get mad if it's her doing it. Anyone else like my dad, teacher, elder, can tell me to do something and I don't feel that rage. It's just something that I can hear in her voice that sets me off like a fucking bullet or something. And I gladly listen to her if she would ask nicely. Like hey please do it. I dont even get mad then. But no, apparently that's impossible for her.</TEXT>

There's been the phone call thing where I pick up the phone or know someone's gonna call, I think about a name or word then maybe 2 seconds after immediately see it. Like an example for that one, I was scrolling through my tumblr and thought about dan howell and then the next post was about him even though I don't follow anyone that posts about him. Last night, I went to pet my cat when I was half asleep, I pet right where he jumped exactly. And then I knew what my friend was gonna say at lunch out of nowhere.

    <TEXT>I'm currently a senior in high school. No one has helped me with anything. My family doesn't know what to do because they never went to college and the councillors are too busy. When do I take the SAT? Do I apply early and send transcripts and such later? How do I get my schedule, in the mail? What scholarships do I know I apply for? I don't know anything. At all. And it's all falling down on me.</TEXT>

    <TITLE>[META] Maybe we fell into a supermassive black hole? Like SUPERmassive.</TITLE>
    <DATE>2016-09-29 00:13:29</DATE>
    <TEXT>Okay, so I am no scientist or anything but I was thinking about this. Hell, I'm not sure if "hypermassive" is a coined phrase, but it probably exists. That's how big I'm talking about. The currently largest black hole we know is about the mass of 2 billion suns. It needs to be bigger. You might be thinking, wouldn't we be ripped apart or wouldn't we know? Yeah, but only if the black hole is small enough. Contradictory, though, the bigger the black hole, the less you feel the effect until DEEP past an event horizon, because (insert complex math that I don't know.) We wouldn't realize we were in one. What if this black hole was large enough to encompass the entire observable universe or something? Time wouldn't stop for us, and if it were really that large, we would go on without complications, assuming that we weren't destroyed by superheated debris and shit. Physics breaks down, and especially at the quantum level... Which is where I think glitches would matter. Seeing things, hearing things, time slips, memory loss, changes, warps, etc. All that would have to deal with a quantum level. The things like the theory where particles can be two places at once, and have a possible pair in another dimension and have contact instantly without sending data in any way. When things get weird like that. SOMEONE call an astrophysicist so they can explain what I'm trying to say, no matter how crazy or impossible that sounds. Super meta. But it's the only scientific explanation I have, besides the fact that it's utterly ridiculous.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>So I'm a nice person. And this kid is annoying as hell. But I deal with it because he doesn't have any other friends to hang out with at lunch. But lunch I like to sit in the library and finish up work or read my book, and he tends to interrupt me. But I'm still okay with that. The thing I'm not okay with is him touching me. He comes in after lunch and like obviously hasn't washed his hands. And he starts touching my face and my snake bites and pulls on my lips. Like what the fuck. I'm not okay with this. But I'm still too nice to be like bruh stop, you know? And he pokes my stomach. It's so uncomfortable. I need to man up and be like personal fucking bubble involves two feet around me. Don't touch my face with your ketchup stained hand. The worst part is the distraction because after that, the whole rest of the time I'm in the library, I can't focus on what I was doing. I just feel the awkwardness. Idk.</TEXT>

    <TITLE>I have back problems but no one believes me because I'm only 17.</TITLE>
    <DATE>2016-10-18 13:36:39</DATE>
    <TEXT>I think it's been messed up since I was about 7 years old. I remember playing bull with my dad and he bucked me off his back the right way and I felt something in my back pop. And it hurt so bad that I couldn't breathe. And that's the only thing I remember from when I was 7 because it hurt sooo bad. No one took me to a doctor. And now, around the exact same area, right between the shoulder blades down a few vertebrae, it's so wrong. It hurts a lot sometimes. If I stretch backwards, like puff my chest out, it'll crack and like grind. When I first lay down to go to sleep, it'll crack. If I twist side to side, the only way I can describe the feeling is as if it's catching on something. The bad days are the ones where I can't even wipe my own ass because I can't bend enough without pain. And I have neck problems now too. I'm not sure if it's because of the back or other things, but its no walk in the park. I get constant migraines from it, and tension headaches. I barely turn my head at a 45 #176; angle just right and my neck will lock up or pop. I feel like it's so dangerous and I know it's wrong. I've gone to doctors about it before. For the last 3 years, I've probably gone 9 times to separate doctors just for my neck and back. My mom won't take me to a chiropractor, and the regular doctors are just like "U probably just strained it, oh u need rest try not to pop them, there's no bumb or discoloration so you're fine." 6 different doctors said basically that. The others just gave me 800 mg ibuprofen. Thanks I guess. Also, um that's not okay? I'm pretty sure just because there's no evidence you can see means it's not there because I sure fucking feel it. I don't know anymore. I feel like a liar and hypochondriac at this point because no one believes me. Because im not some sport player, they don't think I got injured like this. Because I'm fat they think it's just a symptom of my weight but it happened before I gained weight. Fuck, I gained weight because of it. I wasn't able to exercise like I used to. How do you explain pain for years if it wasn't wrong?</TEXT>

    <TEXT>It's my life. I'm 17 and all of a sudden, everyone, literally everyone, is starting to throw everything at me. It went from 0 to 100. Now constantly when I get home people want to bombard me with shit about college, sat, adult things, driving, school, getting my own house, getting a job, doing chores, homework, clubs, fucking everything. Right now I just told my mom that I cant just go from no control to all control. That doing that is like putting a toddler in a super car on a crowded freeway. And you know what she said? "Can you not bother me with these things after work?" And I said, "Can you not bother me with those things when I get home from a long day at school?" And she gets mad because I'm bringing up exactly what she says to me. She also decided to bring up that she does all my talking for me. No. Every FUCKING time I try to talk, I'll begin, and she just talks over me. I've only been dealing with this for a month and a half and I swear to god if it continues, I won't want to go to college anymore. Fuck, I almost want to off myself right now. You can't tell a teenager that instantly you have to do everything for yourself. I've never had that much control of my life. I've moved places so many times, schools, never settled in, never even been able to control decisions outside of home because of constant things out of my control. Oh and all of a fucking sudden everybody wants me to just fucking know what to do. To just automatically go out and do things that require some previous knowledge without assistance. Like applying for college by myself. Signing up for shit. Driving when I haven't driven before. And they say it's going to get worse when I'm an adult. Fuck me. I should have committed suicide 2 years ago so I wouldn't have to live constantly stressed about things I shouldn't have to be stressed about. I'm so done. I don't even have a computer or printer or anything like that so I can even get formal shit done. I have to use the public library, which no one ever takes me to, it rains constantly in washington and it's too far to walk, I have no friends with cars. So I'm fucked pretty much anyway.

    <TEXT>She's 13. Today she stayed home from school because she's "sick." I stayed home yesterday because I was actually sick and I had to stick out today at school with a migraine. Okay this next part seems probably crazy or paranoid but I don't trust her in the first place. She's got her whole life of lying behind her anyways, so its hard to tell if she really ever is telling the truth. Id like to believe her, but actually 80% of the time, she's lying about something. Even a simple question to whether or not she stole something. Right now she just lied to my mom. An example. "Did you buy something from the play store?" "No." "Yes you did." *silence* "It was only 99 cents." At least this time she admitted it. Well back to the crazy thing, ill take a piece of mechanical pencil lead and set it into the hinge of my door while its closed before I leave. That way, if anyone opens my door and tries to act like they didnt, I have proof the door was open because the lead will be broken. It was broken today. She took my clipboard and that's where I keep personal drawings and shit. Like journals and dream diaries. And she went through it but she said she just used it, I know she went through it because I keep my papers in exact order and they were all mixed up. Wanna hear her excuse? "Oh its just cuz they mixed around in there." Yeah okay like the papers could change and go under each other in a clipboard that doesn't have room for them to do that. I let that slide because whatever. Then, I go into my room and check stuff because i don't trust her. I see a pair of my lip piercings gone. That ticked me off because I've told her MULTIPLE times to not. I even put them in my jewelry box where she'd actively have to search for them. She just got her lip pierced (probably to copy me) and i know she took them. Where else would they go? Of course she denies. Then my gum was gone. What really makes me mad is she does it and thinks I'm dumb enough to believe her. That she won't dare to do it when I'm home. That I don't take stuff of hers. That now its little stuff but in a few years it could be from stores and shit. My parents know and I guess they either don't care or don't know what to do. I'm done. I'm gonna spend my money on a couple of padlocks and new doorknob so I can fucking lock my shit up.</TEXT>

    <DATE>2016-11-19 02:07:57</DATE>
    <TEXT>She's 13 and thinks she is smarter than me. It goes past petty sibling rivalry into the realm where she needs help. She uses everything she can against me to get power over me. She gets away with everything as well because she's youngest and my parents always say they'll do something but never do. Wednesday, I wanted to play video games, which she has hoarded in her room so she has an excuse to say I can't play them because she's asleep or whatever. She constantly keeps the door locked. The Xbox 360 is in there, so I have to ask already and sit in there to play, also she has set a fucking passcode on it so I can't play without her knowing. And I knock on the door to ask to play and I hear her moving around in there, so I knock on the door louder. She opens it and says no when I ask, so I keep knocking and then she says stop or ill call the police. She fucking did. She called the cops and said I had a knife, when all I did was knock on the door. The cops even told her that it wasn't okay. And my parents were notified, guess what? She manipulated them to make it seem like I was the bad guy. I got punished. And she also tried to sabotage the trim on the door and say i broke it knocking on the door. She always disrespects me, steals things from my room and lies about it, talks down to me when I'm supposed to be in charge, then she acts innocent to my parents and they don't do shit. Im moving out as soon as I turn 18 and I really want nothing to do with her as little as possible. Fuck her, if she thinks that its okay to treat me like that because she's always in control.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Not all of them are. But kids ages like 9-15 are ruined for me. Sure I was stupid too but then I really think about it and I was never that dumb. They don't want to stay in school, they have sex at like age 10. They're exposed to everything too soon and their innocence is tainted so soon. I'm 17 and I think this. I noticed this stuff with my peers and my younger sibling. What happened in that short time period to change children and teens so much? I rode my bike and played with my friends and stuff. Now they're doing bad things like smoking and drinking already. I know a lot of people start that stuff in their teenage years but damn. If you follow the news and shit then you'll know what I'm talking about hopefully. It makes me angry because I want them to understand that doing that isn't what life is about. They're rushing to be adults and no one really wants to be an adult dude. No one. I want to empathize with them but I can't. I'm obviously living in the same age as them, with relatively the same experience. But how does this happen? Is it the world or is it parenting? My mom and dad raised me and my sister but my sister is becoming one of the dumb kids, whether or not I want to admit that. I'm fine compared to that. So if we were raised by the same parents how could this develop other than what she was exposed to. I keep trying to teach her that its not okay but she won't listen to me. She thinks I'm being like my parents. But its not a parenting thing, its fucking common sense. Yeah teens and shit are gonna do things behind your back or whatever. But they're doing it younger and younger. I know 3 15 year olds in my school having kids already.</TEXT>

    <TITLE>Even college applications have me feeling really suicidal. (Kind of a rant)</TITLE>
    <DATE>2017-01-11 04:17:23</DATE>
    <TEXT>Tl;dr I'm complaining about shit that doesn't matter to anyone. It turned into a fucking novel. If anyone reads this, thank you. I hear all my friends being accepted already but I still haven't submitted an application yet. I will probably be accepted, but the stress of getting everything right is killing me. I barely took the SAT. I got my scores a few weeks ago, and i just completed the first half of my application. Now I need a letter of recommendation. That's where the problem comes in. I don't know who would want to write mine. I don't want to inconvenience my teachers at all with it, EVEN THOUGH I KNOW THAT'S PART OF THEIR JOB. I don't know which teacher knows me well enough. They mostly know my work ethic, not any other traits. Is work ethic simply enough? And I would like to have either my math or English teacher to write it. It seems more... I don't know. Prestigious? More legitimate? Like why would my art teacher write a letter of recommendation unless I was going to an art school, which I'm not. I was gonna ask my health teacher but I know she works extra jobs and plus she's a health teacher, but she is the one who i think knows me the most. Do universities care about that? And then I just want to defer admission for a year to take a gap year. I want to get a job and earn some money for that, do some volunteering. Learn how to drive better. Plus that gives me a lot more time for scholarship opportunities since I don't have much time now and they won't keep the money for the year I defer admission. If anyone out there has any advice for me, I would SERIOUSLY appreciate it. I want to major in astrophysics. But I decided to minor in physics and major in mathematics before getting a major in astrophysics since I didn't want to go to a public university for that major. Yeah I know. I chose a private university closer to home. I know I'm not ready to live in a dorm with strangers. I just... I'm not that kind of person I guess. Its about $32,000 a year. Im gonna be in debt. But how else am I going to get the career I've dreamed of for years without debt. I don't like this life. I can't explain it how I feel like I could. But I guess I can say its too first world. I don't want to go to college like this. Don't get me wrong I love education and learning. I really want to be an astrophysicist. But all this trouble in between almost makes me want to quit and get some menial 9-5. Ya know what I'm saying? I could easily get a job in the union and live a comfortable life with only a bachelors. Sometimes I want to go back in time or go to a place where all you have to worry about is surviving. I long for a simple life. There's none of this trivial life path shit. No deciding which school you want to go to. I'm probably being an ungrateful fuck. But for once maybe I want to worry about something worth worrying about. Back when my family and I were really poor, all I worried about was living and finding a way to get our next meal. But now that we're okay I'm worrying about my life and my future. And I'm honestly more on the brink of suicide now than I was then. I thought my depression had been not as bad as usual but boy was I fucking wrong. I want a good future. My biggest fear is disappointing my family. I know what I want to be. I've wanted to be it since age 14. My tastes haven't changed in 4 years about that. But I have a shred of doubt that once I get too deep into it, I'll change my mind. I know that's not rare. But I don't know. I love space and physics. I've studied it on free time. I've taken classes on the side for it. But is it worth all this? I don't know. I feel dumb. I'm questioning everything. Am I screwing up my life this early? Because I feel like I've already fucked up. I want to talk to my school counselor about this and I think she could help but I don't know if this is the right stuff to talk about to a school counselor. They're there for college and stuff but that's it. She doesn't want to hear me complain that I don't know about anything anymore... I might just get my normal therapist back. College didn't stress me out until senior year. It was like a sudden weight bearing down on me, I think its about to snap. I don't know what to do anymore. I have good grades and I got a good score on the sat and I've done pretty much everything except send in that recommendation letter. I hate to ask someone for it. You know what my mom said when I told her about this stuff. She said "this is what life is like. It gets worse than this." Wow mom. I don't know if she was trying to reassure me by telling me that its not that bad. But it kind of just wrecked me more because if it gets worse than this, then i don't want any part of that. I wish I didn't have to think so much. I want to run on autopilot. Just do the things I need to do without doubt or fear of the unknown. I see people who didn't need college to become something. People that can travel and actually live their lives. I am jealous of that. Everyone says college is when things open up and you get to live for the first time. I believe that's the contrary for me. I see it as a serious part of my life but... I know its a lot different than full time school. But I don't know, I feel like its going to be harder than full time and ill have to do things more on my own than ever. Duh. That's part of being an adult. But I don't like feeling alone. I don't have friends doing the same thing as me. My parents never graduated high school so they have no idea. I feel like I'm thrust from childhood into complete independence. I'm weak. I cant really handle being thrust into the world like that. Its literally giving me panic attacks. Is it that serious? No it isn't. But can I stop myself from acting this way? No I cannot. I feel like my life is over before its even begun. If you know what I mean. Maybe its just my childhood is over. I want to revert backwards. Usually kids my age want to look forward to their 20's. But not me. I want to go back when I was 13, 14. Just getting the taste of just enough independence to have trust from my parents but not independent like now. I'm in denial. There are so many hard times that I've gone through and they seem like nothing compared to this. I have to move 500 miles into a new place. A new school. Away from friends and while just being diagnosed with clinical depression, it didn't help that I had no one but strangers anymore. And I pulled through that. And then a year later once I had made one of the best friends of my life I had to move schools again, but only a town away. And then she has to move across the country. Sorry for that fucking pity party, but that's just an example I guess. Anyway, I guess after I just get accepted to college then I will be okay for a month or so until I have to write my letter of deference. Then I can spiral down again. Thanks.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I hate this so much. There isn't a need to deepthroat your bf in the middle of the hallway. And I'm not jealous. Its just disgusting. And then it makes me sad because it reminds me that no one likes me. If I was actually attractive enough to have a bf I wouldn't fucking pda either. Even there is a line that I wouldn't cross. Today I was just walking to class and I heard the teacher behind me say to the couple "Guys stop. That's disgusting." Mad respect gained for him. And then some lady was like "they're teenagers, leave them alone." Uh no. Its not okay for them to be doing that. Its not just some kiss on the lips or anything, don't get me wrong. Like they're full frontal like about to get naked kind of making out IN FRONT OF PEEEEOPLE. STOP. It doesn't make anything better, you're not cute, if you can't wait to do that then you have a problem. Maybe another FA person out there sees it too and they feel bad about themselves as well, because I know I sure the hell do.</TEXT>

    <TITLE>I always attract boys that I don't like.</TITLE>
    <DATE>2017-02-01 07:15:57</DATE>
    <TEXT>And I always have a hard time with it, right now there were only two and I shut one down. The other one is harder to shut down because I really don't want to hurt his feelings, I feel like I friendzoned him. I really don't have standards that high. I just don't find them attractive and that isn't their fault at all. But I feel like they will feel like it is, when its really my fault. I don't have a type really. I like certain guys that I know I will never have a chance with and I'm okay with that. I'm waiting for someone that I do have a chance with that I do have an attraction for. But I'm sorry but I just can't relate to the dudes that I attract, and it makes me feel like a piece of shit. I do want to give them a chance, but I already know it isn't going to work out and I don't want to drag him through that and make him have too much hope. Plus, it would be a long distance relationship. I could easily have blocked him on facebook and I've never seen him irl, but talking over the year I've known him let me know what he is like and he wants to see what a relationship with me would be like but I don't want one. I can't commit myself to something like that, plus I have college and stuff to worry about. Honestly relationships are the last thing on my mind. I'm almost asexual. I've only found 2 guys attractive in real life and i have absolutely no chance with them because they're basically celebrities. Then maybe one guy I know irl but I don't think he would like me. I'm not sure what makes me attracted to those guys, its just I can relate to them and they're cute to me. But no guy ever besides that have I ever felt that way for. And I don't think that he believes me when i say I'm not into him. I even try to tell him that I don't want a relationship but I want to be friends still but he always tries to drag me back into the ring of saying I will go out with him. He wants me to visit during the summer but I'm not going to go 800 miles to spend time with a guy, I'm 17 and he is like 24. It is weird and I'm not cool with that. Not. I have to find a way to tell him now before it gets really too late.</TEXT>

    <DATE>2017-02-05 00:54:47</DATE>
    <TEXT>We share a driveway and usually on Saturdays I like to just sit next to my window and browse the internet and watch nature. I was just surveying the driveway and i saw my neighbors grey nissan sentra leave. Completely normal. But about 30 seconds later, they drive out again. I was like okay maybe they had visitors with the same car even though I didn't recall anyone driving in and earlier i didnt notice anyone at their house either. I continue looking out the window and enjoying the sun. Another 30 or so seconds later, they drive out again. Same car. Same speed, same sound, same everything. So at this point I was really confused. I wasn't daydreaming because I was actively looking at the driveway. And it would be really weird if they had 2 seperate visitors with the same car who drove the exact same way out of the driveway. Not sure what happened but it did happen. Probably a logical explanation out there but I dont know.</TEXT>

    <TITLE>[META] The dreams where you get a glimpse of the future.</TITLE>
    <DATE>2017-02-07 16:46:45</DATE>
    <TEXT>I didn't know what to tag this but I guess meta works. I think most of us here have had at least one of these dreams. I've had a lot, more than I can count. But some of these dreams were substantially more coincidental than others, like looking 3 years into the future predicting that I was going to move 500 miles into a new state before I even thought about moving and I still remember them. When I realize that the moment I dreamed of is about to happen, I either choose to let it happen or I try to change it so the moment is nothing like the one I dreamed of. But the reason I bring that up is sometimes (maybe half of the time) despite me actually going against myself or meaning not to speak if its something I said, it happens the way I dreamed of. Even if I actively reject trying to do it that way. It kinda freaks me out. The times that I can reject it, it feels weird and that moment will replay in my head for the entire day. Not sure if I'm doing in the way in my dream by some subconscious force because consciously I was fighting to make it different. If so, I wonder why the other half of the time I can do it different. Next time anyone reading this has a dream like this, try to make it different on purpose so we can have like a little study about it. Or if anyone has already experienced something of the like, I'm sure we would love to hear your story as well.</TEXT>

My sister was home all day to be able to do those things and maybe she should be the one you complain to. I came home in a decent mood but every day its the same thing over and over and its taking a toll on me. I can't even be happy unless I don't even talk to them at all that way they can't automatically say anything. I do most of these things anyway on the weekend and any time I have free, maybe you can do it yourselves if you think it needs to be done so urgently rather than force me out of sleep on Saturday even to do it when it would take you no more than 3 minutes of your life.</TEXT>

    <TITLE>Having dreams of destruction and also super weird ones?</TITLE>
    <DATE>2017-03-09 04:00:25</DATE>
    <TEXT>So these last few days I had 5 dreams in a row, 3 in one night, 2 last night. They all included my destruction or me getting hurt. In the first one I got burned because some dude was messing with a mini flame thrower and he got some of the napalm on my leg so it burned. The next one, my mom cut my finger super bad with a knife on accident and the pain felt super real, and the last one I drowned. Those 3 were all about the destruction. Then last night I had one that I was sneaking around my old neighborhood except the roads were all dirt and the houses kept like shifting positions and changing. I snuck into the house at the end and somehow one of my classmates were in there and doing the same thing. Then the next dream (the absolute weirdest and kinda driving me crazy) was my family and I went on like vacation to some town. There was this guy making a mannequin and clothing it in Irish attire because he was Irish and we stopped there and like got mashed potatoes from him. Then I heard music from a diner that said 50's diner and for some reason it had the same jazz/soul feel to it and that classic American 50's voice, you know? Except the lyrics went something about not quitting alcohol and knock knock knocking on heavens door and I was singing the whole song even though I can't remember the lyrics but I know my brain probably made them up except that one part. And the Irish guy braided my hair. Weird.</TEXT>

    <DATE>2017-03-09 05:07:44</DATE>
    <TEXT>I wasn't really feelin too good today from the start because I've been forcing myself to go to school every day because there's no point in sitting at home with nothing to do. But I had to turn in my book for English and the corner of it had gotten a little wet and I felt bad but I wasn't gonna tell the teacher because it was completely legible. And she saw it and said I needed to pay for it and that was fine but she made a little comment afterwards "I bought these with my own money." She said it in front of the whole class as well but that's not the worst part. I played it off well and laughed and she sorta laughed. But I just felt so guilty and humiliated for damaging the book and trying to pass it off. Really really guilty because she didn't deserve that. So bad I came home and cried. Maybe its because I also missed some of my meds this morning but I took them as soon as I got home and I'm still pretty upset over it. I don't even want to see her tomorrow because what if she doesn't like me anymore? What if she doesn't trust me. I don't know. I just want her to forget. You know the feel where your chest is just heavy and you don't wanna move or eat or anything. That feeling. I also told my mom I was gonna lay down and I don't feel good but she was like that's always your excuse because I was supposed to help her with dinner. And I said I'm not lying and when I walked out of the room I heard her say not lying, yes the fuck you are. Wow that really helps. Just because I seem happy on the outside doesn't mean I don't feel good on the inside. I hate that. I can't even stay home from school on a bad day because of this, I need mental days. Maybe if I didn't go today I wouldn't have had to be humiliated.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Facts about me: I'm fat, look like a dude, don't have interesting interests I guess, and I suck at letting my feeling be known. My standards are too high. I like guys that would never like me. I've only been liked once by this guy who I don't like because he bores me and I don't think he would like me if he saw me irl because he doesn't know how fat I am. I don't know. I think I would rather stay alone at this point than try anymore. No one that I am compatible with are even in my league. I like science and boring shit, and the guys that like this have hot girlfriends while I'm a garbage can waiting for some guy to finally express interest in me. It never works. Im too ugly and boring. I've faced that fact and I'm okay with it. It just sucks that I have to suffer because of the genetics and the food I decide to eat dictates how successful I am as a human being. Well, I guess it all works out since I didn't want children anyway because I didn't want to pass my ugly or anything to a kid. I'm a prime example of natural selection in action.</TEXT>

    <TITLE>I've been hearing weird whistling replaying when nothing is playing it.</TITLE>
    <DATE>2017-04-07 18:15:01</DATE>
    <TEXT>That title sounds like some kind of weird scary story but its not. I'm placing this in the glitch category because I don't know where else to place it. I've been hearing a whistling tune for about 2 weeks now, playing at random and at all times of the day. It definitely sounds like a melody, it feels like I've heard it before but juuust can't place it. Ill try to describe what it sounds like in words because yeah. Its like DOO do do doooo DOO do... Repeat that and I guess its similar. I first thought it was maybe the tv like some new advert for something because they use those kinds of things for advertising and stuff. But it wasn't any tv. Then at school it happened so I assumed it was some new song that had came out but no one was playing music (it was the library) and no headphones are allowed so no one was using them. I hear it outside and inside, and it always has like an echoing tone to it which makes me think it has to be electronic and there are no birds or animals in my area that call that way. I live in a little bit of a backwoods area and have a couple of acres of trees surrounding me, frequently I hear the wildlife and know the difference between them. None of my neighbors are close enough to hear even if they did it super loud, and that would only explain the occurrences when I'm home. It still happens in public. So then I thought maybe I'm hearing some electric current or some frequency that only recently I noticed or was able to pick up. But I think I would hear it constantly then. Not in the short intervals, each time it lasts about 5-10 seconds at most. And when I search for it, it will continue and sounds the same, far off and not really in the immediate vicinity. Last Monday I went to the doctor for a blood test and decided to ask them to check out my ears and neck in case that was what was causing it. They're all normal, so I ruled out any type of tinnitus or anything. And since the whistling happens all times of the day, I don't think I'm doing any specific thing to trigger it. What pushed me to finally make this post is what happened last night. I woke up at midnight and stayed up til 2 because I just wasn't tired and I work nights so its normal for me to be up then. It was dark and silent in my house and my cat was laying on my bed. Usually the whistling is really faint and sounds far away, but last night it was LOUD. Like someone right outside my window was playing it out of a speaker. My window was closed and locked luckily. It startled me so I looked at my cat and he hadn't moved, usually he would look like any cat would when hearing a loud noise out of no where. This really worried me if only I heard it. I'm gonna go get checked out again, this time more in depth. But I feel normal and everything has been normal. The whistling started on a normal day as well, so I'm not sure what it could be. I will update this post if anything interesting happens and if its an unexplained glitch or if the doctor finds anything that can be causing it. Edit: I FOUND WHAT IT SOUNDS LIKE. I looked up "whistling songs" so I could research and this came up in my recommended on YouTube! Maybe its really just me but I feel so much better now that I know. I've never heard this song before but it sounds nearly exact to this, even the same tune. Should I look around for something that could be replaying it or does anyone know a radio station or something that plays stuff like this? Maybe the universe wanted me to find this for some reason? https://youtu.be/zQQ5sEOhbjQ</TEXT>

I #8217;m not sure if this is the right sub, but I didn #8217;t know where else to post this type of thing. Listen, there is something wrong. Really wrong and I can #8217;t tell if it #8217;s me or something I messed with that I shouldn #8217;t have. The last 2 weeks have been the worst 2 weeks in my life, worse than I could have thought. I #8217;ll start with a recap that happened before this so you can understand what is happening to me. This already sounds so cliche. I apologize. I just need help. Now my life wasn #8217;t bad at all before this, it was just #8230; very mundane. I had wished for something deeper, something just interesting rather than the same cycle I have had every day for nearly 10 years. Wake up, go to school, come home, eat, sleep, repeat. Obviously there were times in between that I didn #8217;t follow routine, but I hardly remember. But even vacations and weekends were the same. I could never go anywhere, with my parents using the only car for work and there was nothing around me to really do. So I stayed home on the internet. There were fun vacations and everything. But I had developed a case of  #8220;senioritis #8221; already in junior year. Summer break didn #8217;t cure it. Now a senior in high school a few months away from graduation, I just wanted to get this student life over with. Every day was the same and they all merged together to form one solid memory and I couldn #8217;t distinguish one day from another. I was depressed. Tired. All the stress finally got to me a couple weeks ago right after spring break. That week wasn #8217;t long enough and I was in true grief for fear of the same routine. It was driving me to insanity. It reminds me of the quote by Einstein.  #8220;Doing the same thing over and over again and expecting different results. #8221; It was the same thing and nothing ever changed. I didn #8217;t have many friends and class wasn #8217;t something that stimulated me much anymore, either. I thought too much about my future, I had so much to still do. My entire life was ahead of me and I couldn #8217;t even handle school. I talked to my mom about it and she agreed to let me have a break. But she relented a little bit, and what she said kind of pushed me off the edge. She had said,  #8220;Life for you right now should be easy, it only gets harder and harder. You #8217;re almost an adult. Time to man up. #8221; I stayed home for another week, I had a mental breakdown. I was home alone most of that time, and unfortunately I let my mind roam. It always landed back on my mom #8217;s words. Harder. Life was already hard. I felt my existential crisis finally break on the Friday of that week I stayed home and... I think I did something really dumb. I never was one for the occult, religious things, anything supernatural really. But during my weakness, I prayed to God, to every deity that I could think of, good and bad. I screamed, hoping the neighbors wouldn #8217;t hear me. I screamed to Satan, devils, God, Jesus, Buddha, Shiva, Isis, Hades. Every deity I had in my mind. I think I opened a door, invited something in through my weakness and willingness to utter such names. That might sound paranoid or a little bit out there, but please just stick with me. Later that night at around 6 pm, a strange man knocked on my door. I had taken a shower and felt somewhat better, so I decided to answer and I cautiously opened the door. I expected some survey, maybe some odd tourist asking for directions, a neighbor looking for something. Except when I asked him what he needed, he kind of stood there awkwardly. I got uncomfortable and more closely observed him for signs of danger. I was still home alone. He was average. A man you could walk past in the store and not give a second glance. Black shorts, running shoes. Brown hair. Brown eyes, although they were quite wide now that I remember. Although, not unusually wide. Except I remember his shirt being somewhat ironic, being that I wasn #8217;t even functioning at this point. It was one of those graphic tees that said,  #8220;Hang in there! #8221; The ones with the cat hanging on to the rope. As I observed his shirt, I jumped a bit when he finally spoke.  #8220;Hey, uh, I was just taking a walk when I heard yelling? Was that you? Everything alright? #8221; I was suspicious. I guess that did explain why he was dressed in active wear and a t-shirt. I was yelling maybe an hour ago, but at that time I rationalized it as maybe he was walking back to his house or something and heard it while he was going away. I answered,  #8220;Yeah, just uh, got mad at my video game, ya know? Thanks for checking #8230; #8221; I wasn #8217;t going to open up to some stranger. Plus, I know there are kind people out there still, but maybe this was a bit too strange.  #8220;You know, I know things that can help with that. Maybe you need a different game? #8221; He handed me something out of his pocket. It was just a fortune cookie. This was where I shrank back from the door, but I took this offering of his anyways.  #8220;I just came from the chinese restaurant. You look like you could use a treat, you look tired. Here, take this. I never liked  #8216;em. #8221; He fucking walked away. He walked off down the street like an average person would. I was emotionally drained and didn #8217;t even know how to handle him at the door, let alone him giving me this random ass fortune cookie and then walking away. I locked the door and decided it couldn #8217;t hurt to open it up and read the fortune. I didn #8217;t like the cookie and I didn #8217;t want to eat it after that. I cracked the cookie and the fortune was kind of weird. It was in dark red and it was in a different font than all the other regular ones I #8217;ve seen. I didn #8217;t take too much thought to it because the fortune was like the typical generic bullshit.  #8220;Your wishes may come true! #8221; I threw it out with the cookie and I went to sleep. The next morning was decent. It wasn #8217;t raining for once, thanks pacific northwest, and everyone was home. Usually I watch tv with my parents on the weekends and that was no different for that day. But Sunday rolled around, each hour grueled by and my dread for school was growing. The dread for that monotony. The dread of fucking Monday. I knew I had to get it over with. But for that Sunday, I tried to drown the thoughts with something. Music, here on Reddit, YouTube. But when I tried to sleep my mind wouldn #8217;t let me. Like you know when you have a dentist appointment in the morning and you try to sleep but you can #8217;t because you hate the dentist and know you #8217;re going to suffer? Same thing, but I was used to this. It happened every Sunday. At around 1 am, I finally got some rest. I was woken up by my mom,  #8220;Get up, hon. I know you don #8217;t want to, but you need to. #8221; I wrenched my eyes open, and shut down my brain. I usually shut down so I could just go through the motions of every day. She usually wakes me up when she knows I don #8217;t feel well or just to give me some encouragement. I really, really wish I could say it made me feel better because she does it from the depths of her love, but it didn #8217;t work anymore. Not after I became a machine with no real life. Anyway, on 5 hours of sleep, I went out the door and to school. It was your typical day. Nothing happened, nothing new, and I had my makeup work from the last week to look forward to. Secretly, I wasn #8217;t going to do it. My grades had begun to fail. I was a 4.0 student until I just lost my motivation. And I knew this was dumb, with it being my last year and literally a few months before graduation and college acceptance. My mom blamed the internet. Well, not entirely false. When I got home, I worked on some drawings for fun. It was the only thing that took my mind away from the drag, even if just for an hour or so. I can #8217;t draw for shit, so they weren #8217;t good. It was 10 pm and I went to sleep unexpectedly fast. This is when it got weird. I was woken up by my mom again.  #8220;Hey, wake up. I know it #8217;s hard, but it #8217;s alright. #8221; I thought maybe she had taken that day off. Tuesdays she left early for overtime. Also, she could have just been running late and wanted to wake me up.  #8220;Mom, why are you here? Aren #8217;t you gonna be late? #8221;  #8220;Babe, it #8217;s Monday. Don #8217;t remember? #8221; I kind of just sat up for a minute.  #8220;Oh. #8221; She left the room. I must have had a really fucked up dream. I was still tired. Last night, I must have went to bed like I remembered and had a nightmare of an entire day. Although, it felt too real. Usually I forgot my dreams pretty quick. But this one, I remembered almost everything and all the details. Maybe it had been so real because it was based so thickly on reality. Except I began to notice synchronicity. The same cars driving by while on the bus. Same words exchanged by some people. What threw me off was things were also just a tad different. I felt extreme deja vu, but the differences in this  #8220;real #8221; day was different than the one I had in my  #8220;dreamed #8221; day. That kept me thinking that the dream was some psychic phenomena. I wish it had been. The day went by and the same story when I got home, albeit my fucking freaked out mind. I had all my work. But the exchanged experiences throughout the day were slightly different. I felt wrong. My drawing that I dreamt I worked on had no progress, which made me calm down and think that maybe it was just a dream. I went to bed after watching a movie. I woke up to my mom again. Now, this is when I panicked a little bit.  #8220;Honey, time to wake up, it #8217;s 6:00. #8221;  #8220;Mom, why are you waking me up again?! Isn #8217;t it Tuesday? #8221;  #8220;Nope, it #8217;s Monday, did you forget or are you still waking up? #8221;  #8220;Mom, no. It #8217;s the second time I #8217;ve woken up to Monday. I couldn #8217;t have dreamed two days. #8221;  #8220;Maybe you dreamed you woke up and did it? I don #8217;t know, hon. Just get ready, okay? #8221; I was shaking. From fear, anxiety, rage. I didn #8217;t know then and I don #8217;t know now. My mom didn #8217;t really care. I just went on as normally as could. Though, I was doing it out of curiosity at this point. I couldn #8217;t have had that long of a realistic dream. Never. But I convinced myself it had to be. But the synchronicities were there. There were the differences from each of the two previous days, making me more confused. It really should have been Wednesday. I began to think that I was just finally going crazy. I went home that night. The drawings had no progress. I didn #8217;t know what to do. I changed my actions on purpose to not mirror the previous day. The same movie was playing on tv as I had fallen asleep to the last night. I didn #8217;t watch it. I tried to stay awake, to see if I could make sure that the day was passing. I wasn #8217;t risking going to sleep if this was another dream. But I didn #8217;t think it was. The whole day I had been trying to wake up. If I was asleep and it was yet another nightmarish situation, I wanted to wake up. But I wouldn #8217;t. I wouldn #8217;t because at this point, I knew it wasn #8217;t a dream. I stayed awake and at 1 am, I was still feeling quite awake with anticipation of the next day. But I fucking blacked out at the same time I went to sleep on Sunday. I was living a nightmare. My mom woke me up. I expected this, but now I was really serious and ready to figure out if something was wrong. It was Monday. I begged my mom to stay home once more. I really begged. On my hands and knees. She said okay, but I knew it was because she saw how fucked up I was. The same videos were on YouTube. My drawings had no progress. I got a call from the school. My mom went to pick up my extra work. It was the same work. I didn #8217;t know what to do. This was now supposed to be Thursday. I looked up online about imagining whole days in detail or reliving days. I couldn #8217;t find much, but I found some things talking about how a curse could do this. Generic curse that was meant to be a folklore type of deal, it didn #8217;t really interest me until I reached some of the accounts of people of the past who had experienced it and people had found their recountings. None of them were current. These accounts seemed to be of archaic languages up to early 1700 #8217;s and then there was nothing. Across languages, countries, cultures. These were all written in notes or diaries. Maybe this will turn into mine. They had all wished for a different life. A better life. They prayed to their version of God. Like I had when I broke down and called upon the universe. And then this is when I remembered the man who had stopped by my house. I remembered his words.  #8220;Maybe you need a different game. #8221; I think you can see where this is going. Unfortunately, I didn #8217;t until it hit me in the face. These people, in their experiences, a man had came by and told them,  #8220;Perhaps you need a different way of life. #8221; They noted his extraordinarily normal appearance, their vulnerable state #8230; a vague message about their wishes. I kept reading and I realized what I had done. By accepting that strangers #8217; offer, I had been placed in the deal. The  #8220;Curse of Zarinef. #8221; This being preyed on the weak, the ones who craved something more than what they had. And it had chosen me #8230; this was my fault. For wanting more. For the next few days, I had learned that begging my mom worked. I stayed home, and I #8217;m glad I have retained my memories, otherwise I would never be able to recount this to you, I want you to know. This can #8217;t happen to anyone else. I was just happy that I found something that made sense. I was still a mess, but who wouldn #8217;t be? I couldn #8217;t find a way out, there were only the diaries of these victims. It didn #8217;t have any hints to a way out. I began to theorize. Maybe an exorcism. Maybe I needed a shaman. But this curse, there was nothing on it. Nothing that implied which religion it originated from. Whether it was curse or a deal with a demon. Nothing but the diaries and notes. I feared the worst. I had already been living a Monday for a week. I expected that I would have to live forever. Throughout the last week, I #8217;ve been trying to research. I have been all over. I looked up everything. Using my unlimited time, an ancient curse that preyed on the human condition to want more. Was this selfish of me to wish for a life? Was it so wrong of me to just want something new? But this was different. It was something new. This leads me to last night. I had decided to end it. I was going to kill myself. I came to the conclusion that maybe death would solve this, maybe I could have just spent an eternity with that being if it wanted my soul. At least it looked normal. I cut my wrists. I felt myself go cold from the inside out. It wasn #8217;t painful. I know I passed out. But I woke up. To my mom saying wake up. I couldn #8217;t move, I lost will to do anything but blink and breathe. I told her not today and she just left me alone. I think she could feel my defeat. I had never felt that feeling before in my life. It was death. Death in life. I was dead inside. I am living this curse. And that brings me here. I hope this goes out. I killed myself, I #8217;m sure I was dead. And I woke up again. There is no help for me, but I won #8217;t give up until I try more things. But it is in vain. I have a feeling that it won #8217;t work. Take this from me. If you wish for something more and a strange man knocks at your door, don #8217;t open it. If you think your life is mundane, it #8217;s okay. You can change things yourself. If you ever think that your life isn #8217;t enough for you, just remember it could get a lot worse. Although, if you want to live forever, I guess this is the choice for you.</TEXT>

    <TITLE>It's Monday Every Day</TITLE>
    <DATE>2017-04-17 23:36:26</DATE>
    <TEXT>Hey, everyone. I #8217;m not sure if this is the right sub, but I didn #8217;t know where else to post this type of thing. Listen, there is something wrong. Really wrong and I can #8217;t tell if it #8217;s me or something I messed with that I shouldn #8217;t have. The last 2 weeks have been the worst 2 weeks in my life, worse than I could have thought. I #8217;ll start with a recap that happened before this so you can understand what is happening to me. This already sounds so cliche. I apologize. I just need help. Now my life wasn #8217;t bad at all before this, it was just #8230; very mundane. I had wished for something deeper, something just interesting rather than the same cycle I have had every day for nearly 10 years. Wake up, go to school, come home, eat, sleep, repeat. Obviously there were times in between that I didn #8217;t follow routine, but I hardly remember. But even vacations and weekends were the same. I could never go anywhere, with my parents using the only car for work and there was nothing around me to really do. So I stayed home on the internet. There were fun vacations and everything. But I had developed a case of  #8220;senioritis #8221; already in junior year. Summer break didn #8217;t cure it. Now a senior in high school a few months away from graduation, I just wanted to get this student life over with. Every day was the same and they all merged together to form one solid memory and I couldn #8217;t distinguish one day from another. I was depressed. Tired. All the stress finally got to me a couple weeks ago right after spring break. That week wasn #8217;t long enough and I was in true grief for fear of the same routine. It was driving me to insanity. It reminds me of the quote by Einstein.  #8220;Doing the same thing over and over again and expecting different results. #8221; It was the same thing and nothing ever changed. I didn #8217;t have many friends and class wasn #8217;t something that stimulated me much anymore, either. I thought too much about my future, I had so much to still do. My entire life was ahead of me and I couldn #8217;t even handle school. I talked to my mom about it and she agreed to let me have a break. But she relented a little bit, and what she said kind of pushed me off the edge. She had said,  #8220;Life for you right now should be easy, it only gets harder and harder. You #8217;re almost an adult. Time to man up. #8221; I stayed home for another week, I had a mental breakdown. I was home alone most of that time, and unfortunately I let my mind roam. It always landed back on my mom #8217;s words. Harder. Life was already hard. I felt my existential crisis finally break on the Friday of that week I stayed home and... I think I did something really dumb. I never was one for the occult, religious things, anything supernatural really. But during my weakness, I prayed to God, to every deity that I could think of, good and bad. I screamed, hoping the neighbors wouldn #8217;t hear me. I screamed to Satan, devils, God, Jesus, Buddha, Shiva, Isis, Hades. Every deity I had in my mind. I think I opened a door, invited something in through my weakness and willingness to utter such names. That might sound paranoid or a little bit out there, but please just stick with me. Later that night at around 6 pm, a strange man knocked on my door. I had taken a shower and felt somewhat better, so I decided to answer and I cautiously opened the door. I expected some survey, maybe some odd tourist asking for directions, a neighbor looking for something. Except when I asked him what he needed, he kind of stood there awkwardly. I got uncomfortable and more closely observed him for signs of danger. I was still home alone. He was average. A man you could walk past in the store and not give a second glance. Black shorts, running shoes. Brown hair. Brown eyes, although they were quite wide now that I remember. Although, not unusually wide. Except I remember his shirt being somewhat ironic, being that I wasn #8217;t even functioning at this point. It was one of those graphic tees that said,  #8220;Hang in there! #8221; The ones with the cat hanging on to the rope. As I observed his shirt, I jumped a bit when he finally spoke.  #8220;Hey, uh, I was just taking a walk when I heard yelling? Was that you? Everything alright? #8221; I was suspicious. I guess that did explain why he was dressed in active wear and a t-shirt. I was yelling maybe an hour ago, but at that time I rationalized it as maybe he was walking back to his house or something and heard it while he was going away. I answered,  #8220;Yeah, just uh, got mad at my video game, ya know? Thanks for checking #8230; #8221; I wasn #8217;t going to open up to some stranger. Plus, I know there are kind people out there still, but maybe this was a bit too strange.  #8220;You know, I know things that can help with that. Maybe you need a different game? #8221; He handed me something out of his pocket. It was just a fortune cookie. This was where I shrank back from the door, but I took this offering of his anyways.  #8220;I just came from the chinese restaurant. You look like you could use a treat, you look tired. Here, take this. I never liked  #8216;em. #8221; He fucking walked away. He walked off down the street like an average person would. I was emotionally drained and didn #8217;t even know how to handle him at the door, let alone him giving me this random ass fortune cookie and then walking away. I locked the door and decided it couldn #8217;t hurt to open it up and read the fortune. I didn #8217;t like the cookie and I didn #8217;t want to eat it after that. I cracked the cookie and the fortune was kind of weird. It was in dark red and it was in a different font than all the other regular ones I #8217;ve seen. I didn #8217;t take too much thought to it because the fortune was like the typical generic bullshit.  #8220;Your wishes may come true! #8221; I threw it out with the cookie and I went to sleep. The next morning was decent. It wasn #8217;t raining for once, thanks pacific northwest, and everyone was home. Usually I watch tv with my parents on the weekends and that was no different for that day. But Sunday rolled around, each hour grueled by and my dread for school was growing. The dread for that monotony. The dread of fucking Monday. I knew I had to get it over with. But for that Sunday, I tried to drown the thoughts with something. Music, here on Reddit, YouTube. But when I tried to sleep my mind wouldn #8217;t let me. Like you know when you have a dentist appointment in the morning and you try to sleep but you can #8217;t because you hate the dentist and know you #8217;re going to suffer? Same thing, but I was used to this. It happened every Sunday. At around 1 am, I finally got some rest. I was woken up by my mom,  #8220;Get up, hon. I know you don #8217;t want to, but you need to. #8221; I wrenched my eyes open, and shut down my brain. I usually shut down so I could just go through the motions of every day. She usually wakes me up when she knows I don #8217;t feel well or just to give me some encouragement.

For the next few days, I had learned that begging my mom worked. One day, I tried to sleep over at a friend #8217;s house, not giving any indication about what happened or anything like that. I ended up waking up back at home to my mother #8217;s voice. So it seemed like I couldn #8217;t go anywhere at all. I stayed home, and I #8217;m glad I have retained my memories, otherwise I would never be able to recount this to you, I want you to know. This can #8217;t happen to anyone else.

I have a feeling that it won #8217;t work. I #8217;ve thought that maybe the only way out would be to kill the thing that gave me the curse, but I don #8217;t think I would ever find him. Not in one day at least, not with me warping back to my bed when I wake up. It #8217;s been at this for years. There are so many fail safes, and this isn #8217;t some fantasy where I #8217;m some magical hero who can defeat the monster. I #8217;m just a girl who is now stuck for eternity. Take this from me. If you wish for something more and a strange man knocks at your door, don #8217;t open it. If you think your life is mundane, it #8217;s okay. You can change things yourself. If you ever think that your life isn #8217;t enough for you, just remember it could get a lot worse. Although, if you want to live forever, I guess this is the choice for you.</TEXT>

    <TITLE>I know my sister uses my razor to shave her pubes</TITLE>
    <DATE>2017-04-20 02:37:27</DATE>
    <TEXT>I've hidden my razor before and I think she actively searched for it to use on her pubes. I know because there is pube hair stuck in it when I go to use it again. I always have to get a new one and razors aren't cheap, and I don't use the cheap ones either. It is disgusting and I don't know why she would do this, I never use any of her toiletries or things out of the shower nor do anything to instigate something like that. She could use her own razor or save 2 different ones instead of using mine and then putting back exactly like I had it so it makes it seem like she did it on purpose and wanted me to use it after it had been in her fucking pubes. This might sound paranoid but I know she steals my toothbrush to masturbate with as well because I've had 3 go missing and I found them under her bed while I was cleaning. They smelled like pussy. Yeah, I'm scarred from that and I had to start locking my toothbrush in my room after I used it so I know she didn't use that and put it back. Idk, I can't wait to move out so my stuff stays mine. Edit: my sister is 13, stop hitting my inbox with that shit or I'll report you.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>No one I know shares my interest so I came here to vent my fangirl out. Their music is so good even though I haven't really been into metal for so long. If you came here and don't know who they are, they currently look like this (https://imgur.com/3O1MS4Z). The lead singer changes his style every album like a progression of himself and I love it so much. The nameless ghouls who are the other members change too and the members themselves change out every so often. They were completely anonymous before but recently a lawsuit came out for the lead singer which sucks but I still love them so much. Their music is satanic but I'm not religious but for some reason pretending to be is really fun and the idea of "sinning" by being a Satanist is thrilling. This is where the fangirl starts. The idea that they're always in costume on stage and have distinct personalities is so hot to me. The lead singer is so hot, I don't care what he looks like under the costume and the mask, I want to fuck him lol. My favorite costume of his is this one (https://imgur.com/2TOpDhb). I refuse to look up what he really looks like because I want to keep the mysticism going. I would want him to keep his costume on if I did have sex with him. I just seriously think its so hot and I don't think anyone else understands. I also love the way the nameless ghouls look and the way their costumes fit their bodies perfectly. Something so evil looking stirs me in ways I didn't know were possible. The stage presence of the lead singer is amazing, even live they sound the same as in official studio recordings and stuff. Now as his new persona, the one in the other paragraph, he speaks to the audience and involves them in a lot of fun things. And his accent is  #128076; because he is Swedish but he has like a Dracula accent and its so cool. I feel dumb for fangirling so much over them but I really enjoy their music and them in general. I don't care what they do, I think I will always enjoy them. Hopefully this lawsuit for the lead singer isn't gonna destroy anything too badly because I just discovered them recently and need to have them in the future too.</TEXT>

    <TITLE>Nostalgia</TITLE>
    <DATE>2017-04-30 16:02:07</DATE>
    <TEXT>Nostalgia cripples me sometimes. I look out my window and The simple glint of sun off the wet leaves Of poplar and pine needles Reminds me of times that I Can no longer have. It's not that things aren't good Right now. But they seemed better Back then. It won't feel the same in Coming times. A fresh breeze smelling Of wet earth and car exhaust Tainting it ever so slightly. Or soft warm sheets and A dog's kiss tickling My face. The first taste of A home cooked meal And a cold drink after. A hug from my mom before She went to the grocery store for snacks And the smell of her perfume. Summertime tunes that Bring me back to late nights with no worry, Friendship I thought would never end. Spring and the smell of cherry blossoms And ripe hay and The moist air would renew me. Early autumn mornings with The soft fur of an animal resting On my chest, slow breathing. Winter and staying home from school Just because I could To play in the snow. I'm not even old yet. But I already yearn for the times Of innocence, of when all I stressed About was how I was going to Draw a good flower for my friend And what time I should go to sleep. And now it feels like nothing is left. All my imagination has seeped through Cracks left by the true hostility Of overthinking and life. I feel empty. Nostalgia cripples me sometimes.

    <TITLE>I'm pro genetic modification.</TITLE>
    <DATE>2017-04-30 23:28:43</DATE>
    <TEXT>TL;DR: Title basically. And everyone thinks I'm some cruel monster for this. Genetic modifications have created tons of things we use today that people don't even realize. We have grown food more safely because of it, even if we have to replant them each time and farmers are losing money, its stopped a lot of famine. Nearly %85 of corn in the USA is GMO. And corn is like in everything. We've used genetic modification for stem cell research to help cancer, war veterans, anyone who is really injured and need of tissue cells, and mostly severe burn patients with new cells for organs and skin. Tell me that you would rather let someone who had 3rd degree burns across their body die because you only see the negatives of genetic engineering. The part where everyone really starts seeing me as a bad guy is when they find out that I think it would be good for humans to genetically engineer our own DNA. Its not unethical to me, and its not like I'm for creating a superhuman master race for war or anything (although I assume that it would be used for that in a realistic situation). I'm talking about things like choosing partners where there is miniscule chance for disease or defects in their child. Not the "build a baby" mindset. Where maybe autism can be lessened because we can find all the identifying genes. Where disease is less prominent and maybe we can be less susceptible to illness and aging later into life. Those kinds of advancements. In the natural kingdom, natural selection did this work naturally because the sick animals or ill animals would not mate or would die off, leaving the healthy ones. Same with the humans. But with recent advancements in medical science and technology becoming prominent in the western world and even in other developing countries, we allow humans with not so great genetics to pass them on to their children. And so on and so on. With things like obesity, autism, learning disabilities, sensory impediments/impairments, and all sorts of mutations rising recently, I don't think its a bad idea to begin thinking about this. It might seem very cruel or discriminatory against people with bad genes but to be honest, its not those peoples fault and that doesn't mean they can't make a successful life out of themselves and do great things just without reproducing. Sex is still in, just do not have children. But we all know how we work, those people would end up being the bottom of the chain probably and outcasts. Humans would need to mature a very long way before we were able to simply do this without a need to discriminate or feel the need to separate themselves into different echelons. I am one of the ones with bad genes. I have a lot of high genetic dispositions towards things that aren't favorable, for heart disease, obesity, liver cancer, and migraines specifically. That's why I think I can say that I don't want these to pass to anyone so I've gone child free to do my part. If everyone else took responsibility, a TON of unnecessary suffering could be alleviated from our future counterparts. I do believe it would make for a better society if it were just this simple but of course along with it would come the complications of just about everything. Probably debates about what was truly good or bad. Debates on even if someone isn't attractive but have excellent genes should be able to pass them on or they should become an undesirable because they aren't pretty enough. I'm aware of everything that could and would go wrong. But I always have to defend my position if this topic comes up somehow when i say that I am pro genetic modification. It seems to have such a negative stigma around it, I'm not sure why either. I might have to do some more research about that. Maybe its because the idea of test tube babies seems unethical to some people but that's not the way it would work in the real world. Some research is needed for everything. I'm assuming that it would have to be something of a questionable act for religious institutions as well because I'm not sure of the exact quote but apparently once man starts to clone sheep or clone something then we've passed our limits and into the limits of god. Perhaps they believe its crossing the limits of what we're really supposed to do but that's an argument for another day. Anyway, yeah. Just had to get this out somewhere without a chance that I of getting extremely judged by my family, friends, and seemingly everyone I know.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I feel really bad right now. I was doing relatively well, I could make it to school even. But today I just had to stay in bed. All because I read some stupid story about how someone met my favorite band and it made me fucking sad because I won't be able to. I'm aware of how entitled and first world it sounds, but seriously that made me fucking lethargic. It spiraled down into the hole of no return, with my thinking i'm too worthless to meet them anyway and that i'm ugly so they wont care. I hate when i do this to myself because i cause it and its all my fault. I know it isn't even relevant but anything can bring me back down again. I dont know if i need my meds again because my therapist said i was pulling through very well and i wanted to start lower doses to see if i was functioning. Its been 2 weeks and i guess that was a no.</TEXT>

    <TITLE>Kids who act like assholes and then expect to not be treated like an asshole back.</TITLE>
    <DATE>2017-05-03 01:25:04</DATE>
    <TEXT>I hope my sister knows that just because she's young, DOESN'T mean she can act like a piece of shit and then get mad when people treat her the same. She isn't obligated to be treated kindly just because of her age which is 13(if you're over 7 years old, you should know better). If you're old enough to know better and to use your damn judgement on how YOU want to be treated, MAYBE it would be wise to treat others kindly. I ain't a mean person by a long shot by I also don't care who you are, if you're a piece of shit, you're a piece of shit. It pisses me off beyond belief. Maybe its the immaturity but being immature doesn't mean you can be a selfish, entitled, know it all little BRAT. I was raised the same as her and I don't know if its the generation difference but something went really fucking wrong in the raising between us. I swear, I had my moments when I was young but it wasn't nearly as bad as this shit today. When I approach in a clearly friendly manner making extra mind to be nice when I know what the outcome will be, I think I deserve some respect. I know every time I talk to that fucking kid that I will get asshole remarks or complete disregard for their selfish, know it all, entitled, fucking DEGENERATE attitude. I needed our laptop for my fucking SENIOR GRADUATION REQUIREMENT HOMEWORK (which we got the laptop for anyway) and she's fucking using it so I ask very nicely and she says, no you can wait. Wait for what, 4 fucking hours while all she does is watch YouTube videos because apparently "it drains her phone battery." Its not like I procrastinated either, I got assigned it today and it was due tomorrow. Guess what, I held that all to myself and said please? No surprise she said no, you don't need it. I just fucked off because no matter what I do, nothing gets done about it. So now its been 3 hours. She's still using it for her fucking useless shenanigans. My mom and dad do nothing to get it from her because she's an asshole who has no moral compass and too much pride in herself to just fucking say sorry and let me use the goddamn thing for 30 fucking minutes. I could have been done and I could have gave it back in a reasonable diplomatic manner but of course no because she has to act this way like the fucking dumbass she is. When I get my job, I'm going to get things that i know she likes and I'm going to lock them away in my room and not let her use them just out of spite, no matter how hypocritical that makes me. Im literally done with her attitude. I have done nothing to provoke it and even with me fully trying to fucking mend this relationship, she refuses and continues to mold herself into one of the most fucking degenerate human beings I have ever met in my entire life.</TEXT>

    <TITLE>I think my dog came back to me through a glitch or extreme coincidence.</TITLE>
    <DATE>2017-05-20 22:49:26</DATE>
    <TEXT>This already sounds weird but a little over a year ago my favorite dog passed away really unexpectedly. She was a chihuahua and weenie dog mix type of dog, other things thrown in but that was the main thing we identified her as. We had went through a 500 mile move and staying with family members who also had dogs made it hard to accomodate. She had no problems before but this time it was bad and it only took once for her to go. I left for school and came home and my mom told me she had passed away in her little yard area from a seizure, I hadnt even gotten to really say goodbye to her. It hurt really bad and even now I still miss her sometimes. But a few months ago, I went to this random swap meet with my family and someone there happened to have puppies for sale. We almost didnt even see them and as we were walking out, I glanced down and saw them in a basket. The people didn't even know what kind they were and didnt know the dad, just the mom and she was a chihuahua. We had been looking for a new dog since we moved and could have one again. I picked one up, a little boy. I fell instantly in love and,my mom did too, and a week later we arranged to buy him for $200 despite not even knowing his breed. Well its like 4 months later and he is the same as my dog who passed away, literally the same except a male. He has the same color and the same breed even, the swirls of his fur grow the same, he does the same things she did when she was little. We still had some of her old toys and decided to give them to him and he loves them just as much as she did. His eyes have the same look, his ears are the same. Sometimes the way he buries himself into my blankets to sleep is the same. The texture of his fur. He is her. I'm not one for any kind of reincarnation or anything weird really. But this is too much of a coincidence to have been random I think. I mean, a literally random swap meet, a random stall, randomly picking up one puppy, without even knowing what he would grow to be, and it being the exact same as my favorite dog who had passed away. And I thought about it and it had been exactly a year since she had passed, the same month.</TEXT>

Otherwise ive been just laying awake at night and wondering about all the ways I could kill myself. I could drop myself into the river and drown. I could just try to run around town and threaten cops with a fake gun. I was thinking about starving myself. No one would realize I was doing it. It would probably take too long since I'm obese. But maybe being skinny for the first time in my life would give me motivation to get out of bed for once. Maybe the survival instinct inside of me would kick in and make me see I don't really wanna die. Just maybe.</TEXT>

And I guess I must just be ugly too since im basically the same body type as them and I try to be confident and sometimes it works and before summer I even let my crush know I liked him and I got left on read and he didnt even look at me after that. But right now I just saw on facebook he just got with a girl I knew and her body is like mine and shes one of those girls who calls herself thicc but lets be honest, its fat after a certain point. I think that maybe im just ugly or maybe my personality is fucking ugly too. Seriously. A lot of these girls just wear tight clothing and look like sausage stuffed into its casing and get relationships. Maybe its because I dont dress like that. In any case.

    <TEXT>No one ever except one guy has truly liked me and asked me on a date once. It might have been out of pity or desperation now that I look back upon it. But I wasn't attracted to him at all. I went out of the hopes that I would at least like him a little bit. But i was not physically attracted to him or to his personality. He wasn't ugly. He was just average. I could have been in a relationship with him if I wasnt such a fucking dumbass. If I was more desperate I probably would have done it. But I would rather be alone than be selfish and only use him to basically say im in a relationship, that im not FA anymore. Idk. Even though im not attracted to the chads, I guess im only attracted to a niche set of personality traits and that fucking sucks. Unfortunately I think people with those personality traits arent going to be attracted to me because im too ugly. I like funny, dirty jokes. I like chill people. Beards are cool. I like tattoos. I'm into metal and shit. And here I am, probably too weird and fat. I can fix the fat but can I fix the weird? Not sure. Can I ever find someone im really attracted to and they're atttracted to me? I'm pretty sure it'll be a while. If ever. Maybe I need to give up and just settle for the next person to come along because there are no guarantees. Beggars cant be choosers. But then again im not a beggar, I just wish for something real, that real connection ive been looking for. I would rather be alone than use someone for a social front or just to say hey someone likes me. Because thats not what I want. I dont want a one sided thing. I want something where both people feel something. I guess that's too much for me to ask for.</TEXT>

    <DATE>2017-08-07 05:44:57</DATE>
    <TEXT>No idea if this is the right place for this but im going to try. Couldnt find exactly the info I was looking for online. Guide me to like a tech subreddit if this isnt the best place. Background information: Now I've only ever gotten ancient pcs or chromebooks as computers because I've only really needed them for writing papers. So im pretty beginner at most pc things. I recently acquired an old windows 7 home premium oa HP desktop from my uncle, and a free hand-me-down for my first real-ish computer sounds good to me. I dont know what he meant by "he added some more chips in for memory" though. I have no clue honestly because I googled its model #E9220Y and it has a spec of 8 GB ram, not sure if he was doing things that required more. And a 1 TB hard drive, so I'm having a hard time figuring out what he "added chips" to or if he even knew himself. Either way, those specs ought to be plenty for what im planning to do with it if it works. Also, it came with an AMD Phenom II X4, so im going out on a limb to say maybe he upgraded the processor. Maybe even a new wireless card for faster data transfer speed. No clue. Yet. He got a new one because he said it needed a new windows install which he didnt have. Not sure what he did to it, maybe accidentally wiped everything although thats not easy to do.(When I looked it up, this pc is still $500 refurbished, so I think I got a deal. If I can get it running. Although reviews say its slow for the price way back from 2009, I think it'll be alright. And a windows 7 disk is like $10 on Amazon. I like older tech anyway, I feel less guilty if I mess anything up.) He has no clue what he did to it and I cant piece together what he did to it either because even if I open it to look, I have no idea what to look for lol. I ordered a power cable for it because he lost it so I haven't even turned it on yet. Its probably stupid to ask all these questions before even turning the damn thing on but I just prefer to know before I put lots of effort into it. TLDR: So basically he said it needed a new windows install so I said yeah easy enough, its legit with a key and all I need is a windows 7 install disk. But what did he upgrade, does it even work lol. Need to know if this is good for basic things. But with not even turning it on, I will have no clue but some of my questions are down below. Questions: Will I be able to restore windows 7 with a disk? I do have the proper windows activation key, it's 64 bit as well. Does anyone have an idea what "chips" he needed to add? I'm sticking with processor. If anyone has owned an HP Pavilion Elite of this kind, was it good for running applications like Photoshop, and simple games? (Nothing like GTA V or anything. I dont wanna upgrade any graphics cards so im stuck in old-town there lol.) Did I get good deal? It was free and all im planning to spend money on is a power cable and the restore disk, no more than $30. Maybe extra for some canned air to clean it up if it runs. Screw it if something inside is fried lol. Thanks for reading even if you dont have advice.</TEXT>

    <TITLE>Obligatory "why am I getting downvoted" shit.</TITLE>
    <DATE>2017-08-07 05:59:38</DATE>
    <TEXT>Of course, title. I dont know why I let downvotes bother me so much. But it literally happens when I least expect it. And ironically enough. Its always on subreddits where you're supposed to support people, not fucking drag them. You could much rather just move on than just downvote comments I posted. I don't care as much if I get downvoted on a sub where everyone's just fucking around but when I get downvoted for letting shit out and venting, it bothers me. It shouldnt but it does. I think it would even feel better if they could leave a justification as to why they downvoted me. Cuz then I would know what I did wrong. I posted about being FA in the FA subreddit. Yes I had one date a long time ago before I realized I was ugly, a guy who asked me out because he liked me for some reason but I didnt like him back so I didnt date him. I assume he might have done this out of desperation or thought he could get something out of me because since then no one has shown interest or anything in me. But after that ive been rejected by everyone I liked. Yes I did ask them out, all but 1. 4 guys rejected me. Blah blah sob story I don't fucking care right, I just want someone to empathize with for once because no one I know in real life has had the same FA experience as me. And I go there for support and to share my experience and yes I am a kissless virgin. I am FA. But because I had one date back when I was like 14, they get very mad and just downvote everything I say regardless of what it was. Or maybe because im an FA woman and they think that just because im a woman, someone will date me. No. Its not like that. Maybe in their minds. I dont think anything I said was really out of line either. Just fuck it dude. I'm not deleting it this time because that just makes me look like a fucking coward. Anyway, rant over, thanks for reading.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I just turned 18, and I guess to my parents that magically means I can immediately graduate high school, go to college, and not need any support. I chose to take a year gap between graduating and going to college so i could get a job to buy a car and a computer for it. But its only been 2 months out and ive applied for jobs in a lot of places and I havent gotten a call back. And my mom is starting to tell me that if I don't get a job I either need to go to school or leave. And I cant do either of that before I situate myself. She calls me worthless because ive been trying to make my own adult decisions and prioritizing my time for whats more important right now. Because i didnt take out the trash today must mean im a lazy piece of entitled shit in her mind when in reality I was busy filling out up to 5 job applications in one day so I can fucking fend for myself. So that makes me worthless because I didnt do one chore that someone else could have done just as easily. I could be off doing coke or getting pregnant. I don't understand why she is doing that to me.</TEXT>

    <TITLE>I'm certainly childfree and want to be sterilized. But I am only 18.</TITLE>
    <DATE>2017-08-24 09:23:54</DATE>
    <TEXT>I do not want children. I am certain of this, I severely dislike children, and I have no maternal instinct whatsoever unless its towards an animal. A child's cry is grating on my ears and I would rather honestly run away from it than towards it. I have no sympathy for people who have children and suffer for it. Also, my genes are not worthy to be passed on to a child, the world is no place for a child and I don't want to bring a life into this world just for it to suffer. Of course if I really ended up changing my mind I could adopt a child, which more people should be doing anyway. I really want to get my tubes tied or something. I don't want the hassle of birth control, implants, or any of that sort. But I do still want to be able to enjoy sex without the worry of getting pregnant, needing an abortion or suffering through taking care of a child for 18 years. But of course, no one will sterilize an 18 year old. Or anyone who hasnt had children for that matter. I havent spoken to my parents or my doctor about this because I already know the answer to it all. That it isn't a good idea. That maybe I need to have a kid first before I decide I don't want kids. That my parents want grandchildren. Well you all know the kind of shit that people spew to make you try to change your mind. It makes me very angry that someone at this age can permanently have a fucking human being which will last forever but I don't have the choice to never have a human being which will also last forever but have even less of a consequence. I know this is pretty messed up to say but I wish I had been born sterile or with some birth defect where I couldnt have kids. Because then it wouldn't be a choice of mine, I could have just enjoyed living with the fact of being happily childfree. Without the constant shaming of others for having my tubes tied before even having a kid. Man, dont I love how this reproduction minded world works! Its just great when you're sure of wanting a child at ages even younger than 18 is supported but being sure of not wanting one is shunned.</TEXT>

    <TITLE>Sound of pouring water coming from no where.</TITLE>
    <DATE>2017-10-19 21:20:42</DATE>
    <TEXT>Last night as I was about to go to bed, I heard the sound of pouring water like in the middle of my room. It sounded like a pretty steady stream, so I sat up and got angry because it sounded like my dog was peeing on the floor or something lol. I got up to check but there was nothing pouring. It wasnt like a drip, it sounded like cold water being poured into a plastic cup. (You know that sound right, that's kind of specific.) I checked my betta's tank and there was no leak or anything around that, no one was in the bathroom, my window wasn't leaking, there's no leak in the roof. And the sound was coming from the center of the room, where there is nothing. I didnt even have a plastic cup in my room. It was pretty loud and distinct. I would chalk this up to I was hallucinating because I was just about to go to bed, but even when I got up and checked around I still heard it. Once I pinpointed it to the center of the room and moved around and felt the floor to check if it was wet, the sound just stopped. I even went to check the kitchen and stuff to see if the coffee pot turned on but nothing that would cause that sound was on. Being in the middle of the room I dont think it could have been plumbing either. This was a pretty mundane glitch compared to some others ive experienced but I had some trouble getting to sleep last night because of it.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>So I'm not calling the women themselves gross, just the use of the diva cups. Just getting that out of the way. I know this is a gross rant problem but I have to say it. Apparently for periods there's this thing called a diva cup (for people who don't know about them). Where you literally shove it in your pussy like a tampon and its a cup that catches everything when you're on your period. You dump it and then put another one back in. That's fucking disgusting. I don't want to dig in my fucking vag and pull out to dump a cup with blood in it. I cannot get over how women use these and recommend them. Its not convenient in any way except less expensive. What the fuck? Like so many girls use it too. Just changing it is nasty and you're going to get blood on you/on the toilet no matter how skilled you are. And in public? No way. Trying to do that knowing other people could be in there, risking getting blood everywhere and needing to clean it. Nope. I'll stick to pads, no matter how gross they seem. At least a tampon has a long string you can grab to pull out and an easier way to put one in. Cups have a tab thing you use to pull out but that's not going to help when you're late to change and blood explodes out. Fuck no.</TEXT>

I've done research on it and it seems to be the lowest recommended tank size for bettas to be happy. Right now I have mine in a gallon betta bowl because I didn't really know any better, but now I do. So for the 5 gallon, is there any recommendation on what I should do? I know I'll have live plants, a heater, filtration, and everything. Should I cycle the tank or will it be okay to put him in after it's ready? (I couldn't find much info on cycling smaller tanks for bettas.) Or any tank recommendations themselves would be welcome.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>This is my first time actually using the Amazon payments to make an order on Amazon and I couldn't find anything else mentioning this, maybe its just me being paranoid and I have no idea what it really does. And im fond of my mturk earnings and don't want to have any mistakes lol. But I placed 2 orders from Amazon using my payments account, it showed up in the little transaction overview section when you go to the bottom of the homepage of your Amazon account, but I checked later and there were the 2 orders and then an additional 2 things that were "reserved" for the orders and they had the order number afterwards. They're currently pending. But they were listed as taking the same amount as the orders, so I was concerned that it would try to take double what I ordered. I'm assuming that just means it'll reserve the money that I spent on the orders rather than charging me twice for the same thing? Because I still have the even money amount that was in my payments and nothing has been taken yet. Is the pending "reserved" part just the thing that will actually use the funds?

    <TEXT>"Our records indicated your survey took less than 5 minutes and 20 seconds to complete. This is too little time. We want respondents who read the text carefully and not just click through the survey." Okay that is understandable but this is on a survey stated to take 10-15 minutes. Most surveys I can get though accurately and efficiently with half the time they state it to be. Only recently I've gotten this rejection and another rejection from a different requester who rejected me for the survey not taking as long as they "should." I think that this is kind of messed up because this isn't swagbucks or points2shop where you have to wait the alloted time to actually get paid, this is a platform where people seriously do your surveys. Just because I did it quickly doesn't compromise the data if I did it correctly and fully still. I don't mind that I was really rejected, I just don't want my approval rating to go down because I have less than 1000 hits still and it takes a heavy loss each time a rejection pops up. I only have 5 including these two, but are they worth refuting? Maybe asking the requester to take it off but they don't have to pay me if they don't want to? Edit: thanks for your replies everyone, also good news. If you have had the same problem with this requester, I got a reply. https://imgur.com/a/ahkWC</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I am not trans but one of my close friends is. They're FTM. Most of the time when we hang out or go to the store or a restaurant, he'll still get called ma'am a lot because he has a very hard time being as masculine as he would like. And every time this happens, he won't correct them but I can visibly see how bad it hurts. Sometimes I'll correct the person who did it and most of the time, they're apologetic and nice about it. I keep saying, "Man just politely correct them it won't hurt and it's helping them understand." But he's scared that he'll be ridiculed, he doesn't even like to talk about it. I can see why, with a lot of judgement going around about gender nowadays but I think most people face to face will respect him. So I came here for tips and advice I could tell him about to maybe help him feel more confident in himself. I would love to be able to help and show him that not everyone will be an asshole and that he can be whoever he wants and has the right to be who he really is.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Idk why this made me so angry. Also don't judge me because I love to get clothes from Wal-Mart okay lol but the other day I went in to get some basketball shorts. (Now I'm a fucking landwhale and I'm currently losing weight and I admit it.) The Wal-Mart brand shorts or whatever brand they are, the cheapest ones, are the ones I get usually. I wear a size 2X because I like them to be extra baggy. I looked at these things and the size 2X looks like a pair of fucking 4X that I have that I accidentally bought. Literally. I had to get a size Large for it to fit. Are they adjusting the size scale so people don't feel as fat anymore? So like people can be delusional and say you can be my weight at 200 and say that you fit in large and since large isn't that big then you aren't that fat, does that make sense? Also it happened to shirts at my local Wal-Mart. I love my huge ass shirts too, I like 2X shirts. Now the XL shirts are the size that the 2X were. Maybe I'm crazy or some shit but next time I'm taking pictures because I swear they changed up the scale to adjust to obese Americans who wanna use excuses to not lose weight because they can say they wear only size large pants.</TEXT>

    <DATE>2018-02-10 03:46:17</DATE>
    <TEXT>I live in WA and sometimes I like to get the prerolled blunts because 1. I'm lazy and 2. It's uber convenient lol I heard some people don't like them since some growers fill them with less quality shit since you can't really see it without unrolling it. Honestly I like them a lot and there is hardly a quality difference for me if any at all, from what shops I purchase from. Out of dozens of prerolled I've smoked only like 2 joints bothered me because they packed 1 too tight and the other, flakes were getting thru the filter. I would roll them myself but with lack of time I cant always sit and have to roll for a couple minutes that I could be using to smoke. Are they worth it? Probably not. Are they cool? Hell yes.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Years of asking doctors and trying to find a way around the scrutiny and judgement, and to no avail. I'm only 18 but I want my tubes tied. I don't want the hassle or the 0.01% chance of getting pregnant on birth control, I don't want babies period. I would be a horrible parent, but my doctors over the last 5 years and my parents keep trying to say I will change my mind. It's reversible even if expensive, and I could adopt. I don't want to be a fucking meat factory for children.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Basically what my parents have said so many times to me. They go to work, come home, and do nothing. They hound me and literally guilt trip me into doing shit that I can't do. Back when I had school, they would do it to me. My sister gets away with everything because she's the youngest and I have to do everything because "I'm at home all day" despite me working and studying online. But if I ask for someone else to do something, it's "no, my house my rules, you have to do your part to stay here." I mean yeah I'm 18 I can move out, but I literally cannot live anywhere where I live with my income right now. Not sure what to do, I've dealt with similar instances my entire childhood. Sometimes I feel like they had me just so I could be their personal servant or slave or something.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>So many people still believe that they have fast/slow metabolism to the point where it's 10+ lbs of weight either up or down. It's fucking calories. Its just hormones can effect cravings and appetite, which makes you eat more or less. Same with medications. Only a few conditions can really effect your weight to that extent. And I apologize to everyone out there who truly has a condition that fucks with your weight while all these people out here are saying it's genetic or they're obese from their birth control meds. Does nobody even think of these things, or does their weight scare them so bad they just immediately toss it into the "out of my control" category?</TEXT>

    <TITLE>Fin growth speed after fin rot?</TITLE>
    <DATE>2018-06-16 02:12:17</DATE>
    <TEXT>My little guy got moderate fin rot and due to some life stuff i didn't do his water changes or clean his filter and I noticed a couple days after his fins got really ragged that he had fin rot, and I felt terrible because it was entirely my fault. However success in the healing process due to good water and aquarium salt, he's currently growing his fins back and blowing bubble nests. I looked up online how long it would take them to grow their fins back and people said it took quite a while, but it seems like my betta is growing super fast? Well, compared to what i read, the person said up to 6 months. Im not using aquarium salt or any supplement at the moment, and it seems like just after about 2 weeks of healing he's back to where he was before! And his fins were quite ragged, I would include a pic of before and after but i dont have any. I feed him a mixture of bloodworms and betta biogold pellets, could it be the mixture of these high protein foods? Also the tank is 5 gallons and has low flow and is kept around 78~79 #176;F at all times. Has anyone else had successful fin rot stories like this?</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I notice a lot of stories get crossed over in these subreddits, whether it be what a mandela effect is or what a glitch is. For people who might not know... Mandela effects: something you previously think you knew was different and you cant find proof of the past item/memory. Tons of examples here. I think they're related to glitches but not quite the same. Glitches in the matrix: same feeling as the mandela effect, like you're going crazy thinking about it, or your brain wants to forget. Things disappear, move, or you see something out of sorts, or feel it. A little bit different.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>For me to be a human born with anxiety, depression, and more issues, I know for sure that I wouldn't have a child and risk them suffering the same way. I know damn sure that anything alive is going to suffer in any way. I recently brought this up with a loved one because I was pretty upset that day about shit like this, and how things suffer and we can't prevent it other than not existing. He said to me, "well that's life, you have to suffer." It took everything for me not to explode. #1: even if just humans didn't exist, suffering for plants/animals/the fucking universe would probably be less so don't fucking tell me we *have* to suffer because you can't suffer if you're not living #2: humans created the world we live in, why did we have ancestors pass down fucked up ideology and have malformed children to just continue uselessly when it could have ended years ago? #3 that is not a fucking excuse for anything. Telling me that doesn't cheer me up. Its something i already blantanly realize. And obviously it upsets me that everyone is so idiotic that they dont even consider this idea that we could actually stop a lot of suffering by just being less selfish. #4 nothing chose to be alive, a fucking key point of this sub that no one outside of here can seem to grasp. So everyone out there is just content with being born, ripped out of whatever the fuck nothing is, to be in a pain ridden, ugly, fat, maybe even dysfunctional sack of meat? #5 so does that mean they all find suffering as not preventable? I seriously cant fathom how someone with at even low ass intelligence wouldn't be able to grasp that it literally can be stopped.</TEXT>

    <TITLE>Is there a name for this thought process/philosophy? Consciousness and what it is and relation to different realities?</TITLE>
    <DATE>2018-07-04 09:19:24</DATE>
    <TEXT>So basically I've been looking into things of not religious but a more spiritual nature that could be mixed into scientific basis. Basically, a very very simple explanation of it is this: our brains basically are receivers for consciousness. (ONLY WHAT I FEEL/THINK NOTHING IM SAYING I SAY IS FACT. I just would like to know if others think the same and if there's a phrase coined for this ideology.) More complicated explanation: Consciousness is a seperate energy from our body, related to science the conservation of energy states that energy cannot be created or destroyed, only recycled. So could consciousness just be another energy that our brain picks up and we are basically consciousness. The brain is like a radio and picks up on it/attracts it and once the brain is dead, the consciousness may go to another place to be recycled or to a place it was before. Paranormal things may also just be other forms of consciousness or a slip in the way our brain can perceive and we see another reality. We are alive in our meat sacks, and the reason our consciousness is limited is only by our brains/bodies. Multiple hallucinogenics can give the user the experience of freeing the consciousness and leaving the physical form, and people who experience near death and etc have similar stories of feeling like their "spirit" leaves and goes into another realm. (Thats a fact kinda.) What if there is a reason for this? Does it open our consciousness to let it expand and break away from human (aka physical biology, chemical emotions, etc) feelings and be just an aware energy, while there is no physical body to produce stimuli (negative or positive) there would only be nothing but also everything. Obviously our stimuli is interpreted by our brain, but that means nothing without being awake or conscious. And our brain is limited in its senses, such as we can't perceive other realities if there are any, and we can only see things from this world's point of view. We'll never know what the truth is until we're dead or find a magic way to understand what it means to have intellect and consciousness unless we get really lucky. Is there a name for this?</TEXT>

    <TITLE>Boyfriend masturbates behind my back. I don't care that he does, but it's the fact he hides it that bothers me. Is this rational?</TITLE>
    <DATE>2018-07-06 03:45:56</DATE>
    <TEXT>**tldr: title basically, bf hides it** The title is ultra simplified so here is a longer version. Basically, I consulted him about jerking off. Usually I felt like he would rather jerk off than have sex or ask me for a bj or something because he would do it every night despite me asking if he wanted anything and him saying no. Also sometimes even if we took like a 2 to 3 day break from sex, he would have a hard time getting and staying hard and it takes forever for him to cum. It made me feel like I'm not enough or he isnt attracted to me. He said that wasn't the case so i gave him the benefit of the doubt and he said he wouldnt jerk off if it made me feel better. I said he didn't have to do that, i just needed to know when he wanted something so i could take care of him or if I didn't feel in the mood he could do it himself. He would look at porn and stuff, now that doesn't bother me either. But the problem came in when i was out of the room for literally 5 minutes and came back and he was hard like he had been jerking. I asked him if he was jerking, playfully, because I was gonna take care of it. But he said no and i kinda knew he was lying. I always kinda know when he's playing with himself like a weird sense. Ive caught him before this point, this was like the 2nd or 3rd time since he said he wouldn't. And then like 10 minutes later he was going to show me something on his phone and as i was watching him unlock it, the first thing that popped up was some girl fingering herself on the screen. Initially it wasn't the porn or him jerking it that upset me. It was the fact that he lied and tried to hide it from me despite this being something i was serious about. I don't like that his masturbation gets in the way of sex together because it should be something special, not disappointing despite my best trying to please him. He says it doesn't interfere but no matter what I try it doesn't seem to help. I dont masturbate a lot anymore because i like to wait for him and build tension but it feels like he doesn't care what I want, he just wants to cum when he wants to. Usually i never make him wait too, but he will make me wait days or hours and by that time the mood is totally ruined for me. I've talked to him about it before, he just gets really defensive and says i shouldn't care. I wouldnt care if i didnt feel like it was interfering with any other sexual activities or our relationship in general. Its super complicated and theres more to why it bothers me, but maybe other girls out there can get it? I have anxiety so i worry anyway. But the real breaker was today, i happened to figure out that he had searched "Latina nude selfies" and i know that his ex was latina. It was my fault i admit that i fucked up because i found this out on my own wrongdoing by going into his phone and looking just at his browser history. I know I betrayed his trust but its just because he betrayed mine first and im having a hard time trusting him again and i cant ask him about it or he will just be mad and act like im overreacting. I was crying but i brought it up to him and he just got angry again even though im not painting him out to be a bad guy or anything, im just asking him questions about why he didnt just ask me for something. And it was at a time that he should have been at work or driving home because thats the time it was searched. So he's trying to hide it from me in ways that he does it in the car driving home to at work... Maybe he doesn't understand why it bothers me so much? Its so much more deep than just him masturbating. I feel like it interferes with our intimacy even though he says he doesn't. He stays hard when he doesn't jerk off. I can't even get him inside sometimes. Maybe he doesn't see the connections? I just hope he is still attracted to me. I love him so much and that's why i care about his pleasure as well. I dont see why if he was horny he couldn't wait for me if i wait for him, even if its 5 fucking minutes. I've explained how i feel before to him but idk if he even cares at this point about it. There's more to how it makes me feel but i feel like this is enough info. I hate to be the "controlling gf" and i even said he could masturbate as long as i know, that way I can plan sex and stuff around it so everything just doesnt fucking suck.</TEXT>

How am I supposed to dedicate so much suffering and energy into schooling or training when i dont have any to begin with. My future is so daunting. Honestly the only logical thing i can see at this point is to off myself before it gets any worse. There isnt an end to suffering because depression isnt the only thing that makes me suffer. Its life itself. I'm not sure why humans built this kind of society when it could have went so much better.</TEXT>

    <TITLE>Mr. Rogers and my depression/anxiety. (Possible warning for mention of suicide)</TITLE>
    <DATE>2018-07-23 11:38:49</DATE>
    <TEXT>I always watch the show when I'm depressed or anxious even though I'm basically an adult now. I'm always in my bedroom, a candid and surreal moment as I pull up clips on YouTube, glad that I have them. I always wonder if he struggled with such things himself. If he did, he must have reached a true state of self awareness. It takes so much effort and time to become so true to yourself and to your purpose that I think Mr. Rogers must have had a profound moment in his life to motivate him so much. Maybe it was just his drive to help people. Whatever his struggles were in life, he overcame them I hope, and if he didn't then he sure knew how to hide them. Or when he did share them, he shared them in order to help others. Not to belittle others or complain about it. His demeanor and his presence on the screen is something that can calm me down and help me have hope again, and I'm just so grateful to be blessed with him close enough to my decade to enjoy. If he ever dealt with bouts of anxiety or depression, I'm sure he would know exactly what to say. Or even to a suicidal person. I'm sure he would know exactly what to say, and that thought is what drives me. That he would know how to show purpose and meaning to someone and to include them into it all, therefore giving them purpose and meaning. I'm sure because this is what he's done for me. I find myself contemplating about this man, who I've never met, yet he has influenced me more than some who I've lived with my entire life. I find it so *weird* I guess is the word, that he could entrance me in such a profound way and show me the "way to peace" so to speak. I think everyone can learn a lesson from Mr. Rogers. Even if it's as simple as kindness or hope.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Cheating on your partner? Sure! Manipulating younger people into it? "Victimless" crime! Raping or assaulting someone? Might as well! I just think that most humans will go to disgusting lengths for sex or power they get from sex. I find it truly disgusting how most people will always want to go to someone else for it, they always want more, and they cause a lot of pain and suffering to get it. Its like this for any fucking animal as well. It's sickening that most of the experiences I've had around relationships based on sex are horrible. I haven't had one myself because I will never fucking let myself fall to that level of hypocrite, but of all the ones i witness i cannot understand why these people would just destroy and manipulate to get their way with sex or to get to have it. I literally don't know why people cannot logically control these urges. Obviously I get horny too. But you know what? I have myself or my fucking partner. I do not seek someone else, i do not seek those vulnerable, i do not seek to hurt, harm, manipulate, do anything to anybody to get that. Even in polyamourous relationships 99% its disgusting because now both people are admitting that they're already wanting to fuck other people. Even if you end up going back to the same person its the same. They just want to sate their need for sex. It's a disgustingly human thing to do. The 1% who truly mean they do that so they can "love more people" then why not just love them, minus the sex part? Everyone who has children as well. I would rather people use sex for the disgusting reasons above rather than to actually have children because obviously being antinatalist is something I am too. I see nothing good from sex for myself except bond with my partner and a basal pleasure i don't need at all. All these people think its a necessity and that theyre not the same without it. Its literally meant to gratify you. I just wish they would use their fucking brain to process that maybe you don't have to fuck like a rabbit to be a productive person, you don't have to be in a relationship at all, and you don't need that type of shit period. Yeah its all nice but to the sheer scale amount of people that just turn it into something disgusting is huge.</TEXT>

    <TITLE>Is hating the future vehemently a symptom of anxiety?</TITLE>
    <DATE>2018-08-08 12:33:04</DATE>
    <TEXT>I hate the idea of having to wake up every day in order to suffer because I know I wont be happy most of the time due to depression. But I hope I don't have anxiety, recently I had a panic attack and then I decided to look up signs and symptoms and someone said that hating/worrying extensively about the future could be a sign of anxiety. I'm not necessarily afraid or worried about trying to build my life but I just am loathing and am absolutely dreading actually having to go to college or work just to live. I would rather just live on a farm and do honest work with animals all day than try to conform to whatever this society in the US is. I know what the trigger for that panic attack was, but the next day I felt really bad emotionally and I had another one after thinking about having to be an adult. I talked to my boyfriend about it and he just said that I had to get over it, so I tried. But it didn't help, again, because the thought always pops into my head. This was a couple months ago, now I haven't had any panic attacks except minor heart racing and I don't think about the future as much but every day at least once I will think about it and hate it. Usually it ruins my mood and if it has been a bad day, it will be enough to make me cry and sometimes I shake even though im not cold or feel nervous at all.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Usually when he does its in doggy, and sometimes when im on top. But there's never a way to tell if he will or not. I asked him to stop watching porn as often and I know he hardly masturbates anymore. But sometimes when i go down on him, he will be hard and by the time its ready to put it in, he will be soft again. We've been together almost a year, so i dont know what happened? Nothing really changed in our sex life until this started happening and we just agreed to try to cut back on masturbation/porn. I'm afraid to bring up that i think he is desensitized. How can I say it to him without him feeling bad/like there's something wrong with him. I also dont want him to get performance anxiety.

    <TEXT>What I mean by anxiety questions is like for example asking your partner, "Are you gonna leave me?" Because its an irrational thought and just an anxiety thought i told my partner that if i ask any weird questions its just me trying to clear out my anxiety. Most of the time it works because hearing the confirmation from him helps me put the thought out of my head. But if im really anxious, all it does it make me feel like they're answering with what i want to hear and that their motives are actually what my anxiety expects.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I have a couple friends and family who will listen to me, but most the time i feel like i can't tell them anything about how im really feeling. Or what im really thinking. I feel like i have nowhere to vent or no one to talk to. I feel like shit for things I didnt even know i was doing, and then I feel like shit for feeling like shit for no reason, all that stuff. I just feel like there's nothing left for me to do or say really. I'm just tired of not being able to fight off the pain and negative thoughts. Edit: add on because I guess this is like my journal entry now. It feels better to even get it out here where i know so many of you have felt the same. Im just struggling so much right now. I'm waiting for the feeling to pass or for me to fall asleep. Hopefully I can.</TEXT>

    <TITLE>How to bring up anxiety to my doctor without seeming like I'm faking it or self diagnosing?</TITLE>
    <DATE>2018-09-04 06:21:17</DATE>
    <TEXT>My biggest fear is going in for treatment and being told that I'm making it up or faking it for attention or meds or something. Im going to see my doctor soon about this but im so nervous about it. I have a history of depression and I also think that it may not be just depression but bipolar disorder because of my severe mood swings. If I bring all of this up at once, I just feel so scared that he will think I'm making it up for some reason. I also don't want to go on a plethora of medication before I find the right one or have to pay hundreds for therapy that won't/may not work. Can anyone share their experience with telling their health provider about it?</TEXT>

    <TITLE>Age 19 (F) Elevated pancreatic lypase levels, elevated liver function, severe stomach pain got me a diagnosis of pancreatitis, but there was no inflammation present in ct scan and there were inflamed lymph nodes. Now having other digestion issues. Can someone maybe point me in a positive direction?</TITLE>
    <DATE>2018-09-04 10:04:12</DATE>
    <TEXT>None of the docs at the hospital could tell me what was wrong, and I've now been out of the hospital for 2 weeks. I have an appointment scheduled with a GI but it seems like it will be a while, and I'm currently having a different set of issues. Unlike the pancreatic pain i had while in the hospital, this pain is more passive but still contant. The symptoms are similar to IBS from what I've looked up, just for reference so I dont have to detail my symptoms. I'm not sure if its left over issues or another issue altogether? I had extreme pain in my lower left abdomen prior to the pancreas episode and I hadn't ate anything particular bad or different right before. I've been on a diet since getting out of the hospital, high in fiber, low in fat and things that may upset the pancreas. But despite me trying out some different foods, the feeling in my left stomach (maybe my colon?) hasn't stopped. It feels almost bubbly inside and I think its gas but I feel it moving along. I've tried cutting dairy and gluten, as well as spicy and fatty food but the discomfort persists. I have been drinking more water but still have problems "going." Those symptoms are also similar to ibs. I was wondering if the sudden onset of pancreatitis was the cause or could just be another symptom. Of course no one here can tell me for sure without tests, but if there's anyone who has had experience with something similar or like this then I would love to know about it. The doctors at the hospital seemed to be baffled at how someone my age could be having these problems. And I am too. I just want some rational stuff from real people so my brain stops running away until my GI appointment!</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Warning, sorry this sounds like one of the fucking edgy "i hate life" posts that were going on a while ago, but god fucking *dammit* does it feel good to get angry instead of upset for once. Jesus fuck as if I didn't have to suffer a normal life already, I now have a fucking huge amount of issues that stem from the simple existential weight of being alive. Fucking depression, anxiety, I'm obese because of those two. Poor and unattractive. Hormonal issues making the mental ones worse therefore making physical ones worse, a fucking cycle. Now I'm having digestion issues that are probably going to end up incurable and genetic. And it was nothing the doctors can find out, leaving me in $20,000 debt at age 19. $20,000 for a piece of paper that said basically we don't fucking know what's wrong, take pain meds and shut up. Fucking 19, not even able to find a college for a career that I can stand just long enough, already in debt and not able to find a job except online... And this is it, huh? What you call living? They expect us to not look at this way, when it's only fucking logic? My mom had plenty of signs before she had me that maybe kids werent a good idea. Miscarriage, a tilted uterus, genetic problems herself. My dad has all the emotional problems. Now I'm some "miracle" because I was born premature and lived. Yeah, some fucking miracle. I love my parents dont get me wrong, but I fucking loathe them for what they've done for me at the same time. They're great and would do anything for me now, yet I can't come to break them so hard by telling them this. How come I have to love them? Why do they have to seemingly be good parents when they made the biggest mistake in my life *for* me by birthing me? 70 more years of this? Fuck that, man. I apologize to every fucking child being born into this world every second. You're either in for hell, or ignorance.</TEXT>

    <DATE>2018-09-06 04:34:19</DATE>
    <TEXT>I've been lurking a while, but im relatively new. I know i dislike regular dogs, but how about wild ones? Honestly some are fine to me when I dont have to see them or associate with them and they're all on their own. Like wolves, most foxes. (And foxes are arguably less canine and more feline anyways in my opinion) But things like coyote or dingo are so annoying! They'll eat your other pets, your kids, anything they can get if they're hungry enough or in a big enough pack. This happens with "domesticated" strays often where I used to live, they turn into huge ravenous packs who will most likely eat any cat, bird, goat that you have if not completely enclosed. People would dump their animals in the desert for some reason, even though the animal shelter took them for free. And these packs have killed a number of animals of my neighbors and undoubtedly more. I guess the lucky ones are the ones that don't get human contact at all, but somehow that seems impossible because they revolve around us.</TEXT>

    <DATE>2018-09-17 03:53:03</DATE>
    <TEXT>I dislike them both because I feel like kids and dogs are on the same plane. Too energetic and I don't have the patience so I take responsibility to not have one. But cats and reptiles/fish are different for me. I love them. Kids and dogs both slobber everywhere and possibly shit on the floor. The kid will scream at you in defiance, and the dog won't listen to shit because the people around you babied it. If no one gives a shit about them, they go rogue. I see a lot of correlations between shitty dog parenting and the outcomes with shitty child parenting and the outcomes of that. Sometimes kids fucking bite people too. I have a scar from a random 4 year old in some party a year ago when she bit me for not giving her the gift. (It wasn't even her party.) At least if these people parent a dog this way, hopefully they parent a child much better. The child has to grow up and be a functioning adult, at least the dog probably won't last a decade.</TEXT>

    <DATE>2018-10-06 07:10:05</DATE>
    <TEXT>Most of the time we do end up having sex but that's just because I feel like he gives in a few hours after i ask because he feels bad to deny me. I feel really bad sometimes and I always tell him he doesn't have to but he says he wants to, he just can't cum or get hard a lot of the time. He struggles from performance anxiety as well and i have tried a lot to support him but it seems like I can't help him past what I already have. I get frustrated sometimes, not at him, but at the fact that I always have to wait or just masturbate and I can't get spontaneous sex anymore like we used to do. I try holding out for 2 or 3 days at a time and by day 3 I am always ready but even then he seems like he can't cum unless he does it by his own hand. A while ago i suggested that maybe he stop watching porn and masturbating to see if he gets a higher sex drive but instead he just kept doing it but in secret so I didn't know. Maybe he has a porn addiction and this is why he never wants to have sex? I love him a lot and i think that he is worth it. I just would like some insight from someone else about maybe ways I can feel more satisfied and less rejected? Or maybe things to suggest to him to try or maybe he does have an addiction/deathgrip?</TEXT>

    <TEXT>And possibly cause fires or melted ice, unusual weather patterns or hot areas? Article explaining the chinese satellite: https://www.google.com/amp/s/www.bbc.co.uk/news/amp/world-asia-china-45910479 I was shown this article by a friend and thought about the possible outcomes of focusing sunlight onto the surface of the earth. If anyone has seen like the solar ovens, or just played with a magnifying glass, you're aware of how powerful that stuff can be. There's some story i saw recently here or on another sub about the wildfires in california where the firefighters/police said they've never seen a fire like that before and it had to have been so hot to melt things that shouldn't have melted. I don't know if that's accurate or not, honestly, but i found it interesting to play with the idea that if something like this satellite "moon" could be hidden and then reflect sunlight at the right area at a specific point, then it technically could have a laser like effect if i use somewhat logical ideas. Anyone know the science behind this or could ask someone to think this out in a way more serious manner?</TEXT>

    <TITLE>Confused. My N might have BPD which could exhibit a lot of the same signs as narcissism. I'm not sure what to think.</TITLE>
    <DATE>2019-03-04 12:36:22</DATE>
    <TEXT>Of course if my parents are both mentally ill, that would explain a lot. (On my dads side, anxiety, depression, ptsd and my mom may have BPD). I've been researching BPD because i believe I may have it, as other mental things dont fit for me rather than being raised by Ns. One thing i read is how common it is for Ns to be confused with BPD and vice versa because of the traits how sensitive they are, irritation factors, and the instant switch between yelling at you and then being besties. My dad and my mom both did their "best" but there were many problems in my life that i was never allowed to question or i would be guilt tripped, yelled at, complained about, or just shunned and told to go to my room. I was gaslighted a lot and my sister is enabled in her lying and deceitful ways; regardless of what i try to tell my mom about, she enables her by telling me to "leave her alone she isn't doing anything" when she is stealing my things and i have proof and my mom just gets angry at me when i show her. Then later she'll do something like talk to my sister but not actually do any thing about it, just ask questions and them believes my sisters lies. She wont get my sister therapy. Just like she didnt get me therapy. If my mom was mental ill I could forgive maybe some of the issues I've been through my whole life, even the fact that im quite sure I have BPD and my sister might as well. And the fact that i am trying to help and im being invalidated is wrong. Even though my sister does things its because of impulse, mood swings, etc my mom wouldn't believe me if i told her it was BPD. She would call it hormonal changes or something. This is why im confused, since even though I deal with the same irritation issues and stuff, i never take it out on the people around me when I can help it. She will, ruthlessly, then act like nothing happened. It isn't okay to not get help regardless of if you think you're ill or not. It's quite obvious she has issues too but she doesn't even think she does. And she has the nerve to hate on me for not being able to function as a human when I've been treated this way my whole life thinking it was normal...</TEXT>

    <TITLE>I got banned from a certain sub (some of you may know) for having BPD and it upsets me because I feel like it had very relevant information to me.</TITLE>
    <DATE>2019-04-04 00:50:54</DATE>
    <TEXT>I don't want to name the sub as it will cause shit, but i will say I am %100 sure at this point in time my mother has BPD as well. I'm sure that I was either born with it or developed it due to having to grow up in an emotionally abusive home. A lot of the things posted in that sub were so eye opening and useful to me. I didn't want to have to make an alt account to interact with people on there, because sometimes goddammit I have questions and want to talk to people who relate to me. I feel like growing up with someone abusively borderline is much different than many of us here, who have been through therapy or are at least aware of what we went through and our behaviors are very tame in the abusive department due to mindfulness. It upsets me to be banned from there because what i said had in no way indicated I had BPD. It feels kinda intrusive/obsessive for somebody to go through several of my post histories to find something related to it or see what im subbed to and ruin my time there knowing that we are sensitive regardless. Like they're trying to rile us up, regardless of whether we did something or *not*... Hell i may simply be c-ptsd, does that change the fact that some of us went through growing up with a bpd parent? My dad was emotionally absent due to being mentally ill as well. That we may have valuable input free of our BPD label? Impossible to people in that sub. I'm so upset that they choose to kick out a lot of people that could benefit from it. Does it stop me from making another account and still going on that sub? No. But I'm not going to because how can I just read things and not be able to feel safe to interact without fear of saying something wrong. Edit: .. I didn't think I was violating anybody or doing anything toxic/breaking boundaries by simply commenting absentmindedly, and I was replied to in a provocative way as to incite anger response but all it did was upset me lol. Edit 2: did someone seriously feel it necessarily to downvote me now I'm crying lol, where can I get some support that doesnt make me feel bad for trying to talk to people</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Sometimes I swear I feel like the only one trying to understand me and how life works etc. Out of my family, I am the only one in therapy and group and on meds and i know the rest of my family could at least use therapy. But everyone will always make an excuse. I fight very hard to not be a toxic person, every day I fight with mindfulness and all that type of stuff in order to seem like an okay person to them, but i feel like no one realizes it. maybe its the need for approval thing in me, but i dont even get a good job or they dont ask me about group or nothing like that. i just spend 4 days in a mental institution so i could speed up the med process and i was pretty sure i was about to off myself because of my invalidating ass family. That made them change enough just to be nice, but i still dont get the support i need and i dont have friends and my bf doesnt really give it either because nobody seems to know how to support me. But when i try to teach them, they never remember or dont care at all, i know habits take long to break because I AM DOING IT TOO WHY CANT YOU?

    <TEXT>I feel like my sister (younger) was the favorite child. My parents always catered to her, let her do things i wasn't allowed to do, sided with her during arguments, etc. If she hurt me during a fight, it was "me who started it." I always had to hear "be the bigger person!" While my sister could scream and yell at me for not letting her play with/destroy my things. And all that lead to my sister disrespecting me constantly because i couldn't react or respond without her being the one in the right. And this disrespect carried on to my little cousins around her age, as they began disrespecting me too. Even as I've moved out, my mom will constantly compare me to her. She always says I am way messier than my sister, my sister has more opportunities than me, and such. But I don't even believe that it's true. But hearing it all the time makes me feel like shit. I just feel like a lot of pwbpd ended up being the forgotten child, the scapegoat. We're always invalidated in order to praise the other child.</TEXT>

    <TITLE>Not sure where to post this. What my bf encountered when he died.</TITLE>
    <DATE>2020-02-26 20:17:50</DATE>
    <TEXT>About 6 years ago, my boyfriend died from an overdose, he has been clean since. But when he died, he saw a humanoid golden being with eyes all over it's body, and it relayed a message to him. He said the being looked at him but didn't open it's mouth, it talked through telepathy and said "Humans will be their own destruction." I can ask him for more details if you want! Could this being be trying to scare him or joke with him? Or would such an encounter mean truth? From my opinion, I believe he experienced this but it could have been a vision released by DMT, our brain releases it when we die. If it wasn't however, I believe it could be one of the "spirits" that help us move on to other worlds or perhaps even a being that is attached to him in some way. After this, he went on to experience something of a glimpse of his afterlife. I've done so much looking on the internet for any being that could appear in that way. But I've had no luck. I don't even know where to post but I figured it would be good here.</TEXT>

    <TITLE>My boyfriend wants to work 12 hours in the day and 8 hours at night. He doesn't seem to want to change his mind. Idk what to say.</TITLE>
    <DATE>2020-02-27 17:12:53</DATE>
    <TEXT>Idk. Idk. Idk. He is already working 12 hours and when he gets home, usually he picks me up and we go on dealing wheels if you know what i mean. So we're always making money in other ways. We usually don't get home til 10 or 11 so he is basically already working the WHOLE time he is awake. The time in the car and being asleep is basically all i get to spend time with him and none of it is intimate in any way because we're in the car or asleep lol. But recently he's been talking about his future and stuff, which I encourage him to do. But he has the notion that if he works literally day and night that he will be guaranteed success. And I dont believe that. Yeah we need money. But the problem is saving money, not making more. And every option I throw out to him to save money, I dont really get his opinion or a response, like all he is set on is working. I don't think he realizes that you can really die from working like that. Japan has the highest death rate for being overworked and stressed. Just look at some of the people there and tell me that it is good to work that way. I also dont think he realizes what exactly he is sacrificing. He is sacrificing his relationships and everything else almost if he wants to do this. I feel like i would have to break up with him even though its the last thing i want to do, because he wouldn't be able to meet even my basic emotional/physical needs if all we did was go to sleep in the same bed and he'll be gone by morning. At the same time I'm so conflicted because I feel selfish telling him not to work like that. Its what he wants to do and he believes in it, so who am I to tell him how to run his life? Its his future and his right. At the same time, thinking about my needs, I wouldn't be able to handle seeing him become a stranger in front of my eyes. Just the way my BPD brain works is if im not having what i feel like is genuine time and connection with someone. I don't "love" them anymore really. Like complicated form of splitting, if someone isn't in my life besides 1 hour at most a day, I can't connect to them. Even though I love him dearly right now, I couldn't see myself being able to hold that love over the course of 2, 3 years if he works like this. Idk how to help his workaholic personality, idk if its coming from his drive to do better or simply a distraction from it all. Working a regular job with overtime was hard enough for him, why does he think he will be able to do 20 hours? He already has back issues and is in near constant pain. I dont know what to do.</TEXT>

    <TITLE>Cut my hair short for the first time in my life. My mom says "honey stop cutting your hair."</TITLE>
    <DATE>2020-03-13 18:41:20</DATE>
    <TEXT>I've had long long hair all my life. I'm 20 fucking years old and I don't live at home anymore, I wanted a change. So i cut my hair short. I basically have a mullet thats shorter in the back with v bangs. I had emo hair before but the back was always really long, at least to my mid-back. Ive cut my own hair since I was 16 because the hairdresser never knows what I mean when i show a picture or explain it to them, so I took it into my own hands. I've never been made fun of for my hair except by my mom. All my friends envy my hair because "it looks like the OG goth hair." I love layers, teasing, death hawks, all that cool stuff. I just do it myself. My mom always didn't like it when I cut my hair. She'd always tell me to stop and that it looked fine. My dad always tells her to keep her hair long and shit and I dont need her projecting that onto me. I got tired of my hair being in my way all the time. I know my mom thinks I look bad with short hair. So I never did it and I did now. I look fine. I look good actually. Which i never say. WHY DID I EVEN SHOW MY MOM. Well I decided to tell my mom, which was a bad idea anyways. And she just says. "Honey stop cutting your hair." I'm honestly contemplating shaving my head. It looks good, to me. I'm just not used to it yet. I feel more free and it feels strange. Idk why our moms have to fucking judge us for almost nothing. In a couple months it'll be back where it was before. I don't care if I look "gay" if i look like a "boy" if I don't have long precious locks of hair. What's wrong with either of those anyway?!</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I know the reason I cut is because my mom is a narcissist. I've even done a lot of research before labeling her as one, because people throw that word around so loosely. From birth, she conditioned me to bottle up all my emotions and I had no way to validate myself and I didn't learn any emotional regulatory skills from her, leading me to self harm. SO MANY STORIES of people here or on the regular sh subreddit tells of major narc red flags for their parents, partners, friends. There's a huge community here on reddit that can help you understand the roots of your suffering if you feel like either or both of your parents were/are narcs.

    <TEXT>I see everyone having multiple points of view, and none of it is cohesive. From my perspective, I only know 2 people who came down with symptoms, and neither of them were allowed to be tested. One of them is 20 and the other in her 60s. I have no idea what to think, I don't know what's true or what isn't. All I know is how the virus works. How do we know the actual count if so many of these people are unable to be tested? One is my aunt, she lives in CA and she can't get tested. The other is my best friend's bf and he lives in Ohio. How many people possibly are sick with the virus but arent getting tested? Therefore leading us into numbers that arent true at all. I see a lot of people saying it isn't the virus itself, but the hospitals and stuff that cant hold enough people. Or the reaction of us all that is dangerous. And some people are believing the media and panicking over these things. And then you have Trump trying to open everything before easter. An economic collapse is coming too, if nothing gets straightened out. I know how the virus works and everything, but if so many people get over it with little to no healthcare, why is it being portrayed like it will kill anyone who gets it? Who do we believe at this point? Do we believe ourselves and the people around us based on experience? Or do we believe the ones in charge?</TEXT>

    <TITLE>Pro of adopting, you can skip the baby stage if you choose.</TITLE>
    <DATE>2020-03-27 13:29:38</DATE>
    <TEXT>The majority of your time and money put into children is probably younger children. Diapers, wipes, clothes they grow out of in a month, special formula and food, etc. Almost 75% of the reason I'm childfree is the fear i wont have enough time or money for a baby/toddler. Plus, if there's an older child (8-15) they're probably going to be more grateful to be adopted because nobody adopts older kids that I know of. Most of the time they're sent out on their own I think, I don't even hear stories of older kids getting adopted. People are scared of adopting older children because "they're set in their ways, they might be troublemakers." Alright and? You might just be upset that you can't train them to be your slave! If you spent the majority of your life in foster care you'd have issues too. They have the ability to change like anyone else, and if someone willingly adopts. They'd be up to that challenge, to teach the kid new coping, emotional regulation, and how it feels to have a normal teenage life possibly. I imagine if i got adopted at that age, I'd feel like I had lost hope until i was 18. Living in a group home is nothing like a real home. Adopting an older kid, letting them get used to things for a few months, and then letting them explore who they really are sounds so much better than just kicking them to the curb at 18 where they'll barely have an idea of how to survive because nobody had time for them or really cared. I don't know the costs of adopting an older kid, either. Would it be cheaper because they're older?</TEXT>

    <DATE>2020-04-03 18:06:25</DATE>
    <TEXT>Not sure, but last year in august i had acute pancreatitis, I'm not a drinker or a smoker, female 20yrs old. I had been on a "healthy" diet, mostly salads and lean chicken, and fish. I believe that eating salads raw flared up the diverticulitis and caused some sort of chain reaction into my pancreas, also my lypase were 9000+ and my liver showed fatty. No doctors could tell me what was up, they seemed to ignore the pain i was having in my colon and I had ct scans/ultrasounds on my upper abdomen, but they didn't find a blockage or problems with my gallbladder. I've had history of thyroid issues but they seemed to go back up just to low normal levels. Today, and the last 2-3 days, I've been having the colon pain, gas and foul fatty stools. I know this is close to what happened right before i felt the pancreas pain. So I went to clear liquid diet. Can anyone help speculate/give ideas to what's really going on? Lately I've been eating random things so I can't pinpoint anything specific because they weren't giving me issues until right now. Ive been eating pretty badly, so I chalk it up to that? But if so, why flare up now and not months ago?</TEXT>

    <TITLE>I keeping getting ads that trigger me. Please help. (Tw sexual mentions)</TITLE>
    <DATE>2020-04-08 20:01:29</DATE>
    <TEXT>When I go online, even YouTube, I get dating ads, sex chat ads, and ads specifically for latina/black girl p*rn. Its been happening for a few weeks, but the last few days it has been way more noticeable. The reason this triggers me is because in the past my bf was addicted to latina p*rn and I'm white, so it gave me major self esteem issues. He couldn't get it up for me, or even orgasm for me, but he would always masturbate to these things, even behind my back. Before bed I would ask him for sex and he would say maybe later, and then once he thought i was asleep he would masturbate to these videos. Even if I offered a bj he would reject me and do that. He always said he was attracted to me, etc, but I just couldn't believe him. He agreed to not watch p*rn anymore and it took me months to believe that but I think he did stop. I can't watch p*rn at all without getting triggered, so i know that the ads aren't based on my "interests" like some websites do. I'm worried somehow that the ads are appearing on my phone because my bf has been watching them again and the Wi-Fi for our house is giving ads to me based on his usage of these things. I don't even know if that's possible, but alas my BPD brain likes that idea. Lately we haven't been having a lot of sex and I keep seeing these ads on my phone. He usually gets horny when he's home with me and he hasn't been asking or wanting anything, even though I'm almost always willing. In the past he would "go to the bathroom" and spend 30 minutes in there and say he was pooping but he wouldn't want me to do anything sexual after that, didnt even want me to touch down there. He said its because its sensitive from the last time we did anything, sometimes that would be 2 or 3 days, but it was because he just masturbated. i notice he's been "going to the bathroom" for a long time before bed and maybe 4 times during the day lately. Usually he goes 1-2 times. I'm so scared he is doing these things again. He has been having a hard time getting hard again. He always goes when im asleep, either in the morning or right before i fall asleep. I'm probably wayyyy over analyzing but these ads just bring all the ugly feelings back. I wanna split on him and accuse him of doing these things behind my back again. I feel so unwanted and ugly when I see these things. I just am mortified my bf would do these things in the first place and after the first issue i couldn't handle going through it again. It would probably be the thing that ends us because I simply cannot handle feeling inferior to latina and black girls because I dont have that body and never will.</TEXT>

But it especially pisses me off when parents say it straight in front of the kid. ~ I would usually just be playing my video games, being respectful and quiet, but if i got even the LEAST bit loud then my mom would just complain that we werent in school. Sometimes she would do it even if I wasn't "bothering" her. I would feel so hurt and anxious after she said it. It felt like she was deliberately taking away my fun with her words. Which she probably was. It just feels so violent in my mind. I will be literally vibing, finally feeling some positive emotions, then out of nowhere, BAM the spiral. Just the whole spiral down into nothingness once again. My mom saw me playing with my dog when I was like 10 or 11, just running around the yard with him chasing me. She says, "I can't wait for y'all to go back to school" and I just feel dead. I stop running, just kinda stare at my dog, the thoughts in my head are, "What did I do wrong? Why do I always have to be reminded of school? Maybe I'll just stay in my room all day and it will be like I'm in school." All my responsibilities even as a child, come flooding into my mind, paralyzing me. As a kid I hated school, and breaks were the only way I could "forget" that it existed and I actually felt free. But she would always constantly remind me of school, making it so i could never just have some carefree fun. She did this until I was in high school. After that sentence didn't work anymore, it was after I graduated HS her new line became "You need to apply for college!! Get loans and grants and scholarships!! Do your schooling!!" I don't want to go to a traditional college and I definitely don't want loans out for it. She figured that out and the new line became "You need to get a job!" Every single day! I would go to an interview and I'd come home to the same "reminder" every day... Then it became "you need to work more!!" I was working 25 hours a week at $14 an hour just to pay my dues, I didn't need anything fancy. But nothing was enough for her. ~ She does this with a lot of things. Say I have a responsibility to take care of soon, i KNOW that I need to take care of it and I will later. She will constantly tell me I have to do it or remind me every hour I need to do it. Its not even something I'm procrastinating, just something i havent got to yet. It makes me so mad because A. I know i have to do it. B. I don't have to do it at this second C. I'm pretty sure she's saying it just to stress me out at this point. Even now, I still have issues with this type of thing. If I'm stressed out or trying to distract myself from something I don't want to think about and someone reminds me of it then I still get that frustrated feeling because I'm so used to my mom using it against me that I feel almost traumatized by people doing this, even if its a genuine innocent reminder. I always have to sit there for a solid minute and remember that people don't have the same intent my mom did. (This is an extreme example so im sorry for the exaggeration) For example, if someone had cancer and they were terminal, they KNOW that. If they're having fun the best way they can, going out and doing things they always wanted to do, would you constantly stop them in the middle of their enjoyment and be like, "hey remember you're gonna die in like a month and you've got cancer." IMAGINE HOW THEY'D FEEL. You'd sap their distractions right away, leaving them existential and anxious probably. Or if someone was in a hostage situation and trying to keep themselves sane by doing whatever, you wouldn't keep reminding them that they're a fucking hostage and have the chance to be tortured right now. ~ If someone has a duty to do, like taxes or house cleaning, they know they gotta do it. Reminding someone every hour on the hour just feels extreme. And for me, it makes me want to do it even less because it feels like you're almost forcing me, like the little rebel in me gets more and more angsty the more I'm reminded. Like, I will get to something when I get to it. I always do. It might be the next day or it might be in the next few minutes, either way it's getting done. I don't need constant reminders to be ripped back into reality!! ~ I dissociate a couple times a week and every time I stop dissociating it feels like this too, which I'm afraid is a product of this stuff weighing on my mind. I'm mad at my brain for taking me out of the peace that is dissociating, because I don't get peace anytime. When I'm dissociated, my responsibilities become robotic and I'm no longer worried or concerned about the future or past, I am just doing. But when I come out of my dissociation, it just feels like I'm being boiled in a pot of reality. I think my mom's constant reminders for whole life has caused some levels of anxiety/loathing in me. I'm constantly thinking about things in the future I don't want to do and loathing that I have to do them. I constantly think about things in the future I DON'T feel like doing instead of things I do want. Stuff like go to work the rest of my life, perpetual chore cycles, etc. I feel like I can't recover that blissful ignorance by myself, unless I do drugs, which I don't want to do. I'm always scared that if I feel that blissful ignorance and escape from reality, something/someone will ruin it for me, and I'd rather not have it at all than to have it and feel the way I do after the spell is broken. ~ I'm not sure if any of this made sense but thanks for reading if you made it this far. It just hurts me to know the cycle that happened to me started with "innocent" complaints by my mom, and seeing other parents openly doing this on social media to their kids is fucked up and triggering. Good way to make your kid feel anxious, abandoned, and annoying!</TEXT>

    <TITLE>Me and a friend heard the same flute music and nothing was playing it?</TITLE>
    <DATE>2020-04-15 13:37:46</DATE>
    <TEXT>Was originally gonna post in glitch in the matrix but it may go here better. Me, my friend chad, and my bf were hanging out at his job. He's a security guard so we were all sitting in the booth, it may be like 10 #215;10, so its fairly small. No one else was around, they were all inside the warehouse building. Because the booth is so small, its easy to know where sounds are coming from and there's only so many options. I started hearing flute music, kinda like "elven" or like you would hear in lord of the rings in the shire. I thought it was just my friend or my bf's phone games as they were playing on their phone, but mine was dead so i know it wasnt playing. I also thought it could have been the small radio but the direction of the sound was coming from the left not the right, where the radio was. I kept hearing it off and on and then I said to everyone, "What's the music playing lol" and then my friend said he heard it too! I had my bf turn up his sound and it wasn't his game, my friend was playing clans of clans so it wasn't his game either. As we sat to listen as soon as we really stopped paying attention or got distracted, i thought I could hear it again and he did too. My bf says he didn't hear anything. So me and my friend start checking the computer and no ads are playing or anything. The speakers are not on. We check the small radio, and make sure the phone volumes are all the way down. We didn't hear it after maybe catching small tidbits floating back in and not being able to focus on it due to being distracted when we think we heard it. It seemed to float in and out of sound, instead of abruptly stopping/starting. So it was hard to notice it since it creeped in slowly, if that makes sense. ~ I just think its weird because it was a nice day and the music was very pleasant, I felt like I was in the middle of the forest like a Disney character lol. Then i started to think about it and realized wait, nothing is playing that music. After i thought that the music kept going, but once i brought it up it kinda faded. I think its weird my friend and me heard it but not my bf because it was playing like a gentle background noise, so it wasn't exactly quiet. I could go on youtube and find something very similar to what we heard if anyone is interested in that link.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Im not sure if I'm just looking into it too much, but i feel like my bfs family doesnt like me. Right now im staying with him, his mom, and his sister. His sister is younger than us and always has an attitude towards us. She will nitpick anything, for example, if i cleaned the whole kitchen and vacuumed, she will get mad that i forgot to put toilet paper back on the roll and not care i did all the other things i was supposed to. She's very passive aggressive and honestly kinda narcissistic and i feel like she is targeting me? Most of the stuff she complains about is related to something i did. (Or didnt do) His mom is way more ambiguous. I will always say good morning and be polite, but she never talks to me first or addresses me by name. Both his sister and mom put off vibes that just make me very uncomfortable. I just dont find them easy to be around. Also something they do that bothers me is they will order food or make dinner for themselves and leave me and my bf out, even though we dont leave them out except on rare occasions. I feel like they want to say something to me but aren't. I feel like they're judging me almost. We pay our share of rent and food, i clean up, I'm in my room most of the day so I'm not intruding. I dont get what i did? Is this just their family dynamic? I usually try to be nice and outgoing but they feel kinda standoffish?</TEXT>

In Washington i could at least not think about it as much because the fast food restaurants are spread further out and not all bunched together like this.

The only option i have is the copper IUD but i have a lot of issues with that just personally.

    <TITLE>How to still be nice when you're fed up/drained by people?</TITLE>
    <DATE>2020-05-14 16:01:36</DATE>
    <TEXT>Usually i tend to make an excuse to go away or leave, but some people see that as rude. Yesterday i went to a birthday party for my friend's son, and her friend came over with 3 more kids. Now i honestly never seen kids act this way. I think there may have been developmental issues because one of the girls was a savage, meaning she was maybe 4 or 5 and ruining my friends house. She had grabbed the streamers and was taking it all over the house and she dumped the confetti in the dog's water. She had been there 20 minutes and everyone of the adults including me had to step in. One time i said "hey give that to me please" and when she tried to run, i grabbed her arm and took it, and then she acted so shocked that i actually stopped her. The other older girl maybe 7 or 8, was just making wailing noises even though there were no tears or nothing visibly wrong. She would be playing and laughing while simultaneously making these wailing noises. Every once in a while she would stop, look at her mom to see if she was giving a reaction, and if not, keep wailing. The boy was more "normal" but definitely no social reading skills. When random kids just come up and hit me in the face with balloons so hard it knocks my glasses off, its hard not to want to say something mean. But i didnt. I was just sitting on the couch chilling and he like hits me with the balloon like a boxing glove. Im not leaving out mentions of mom either, she was trying to keep them under control but she wasn't trying very well, she would just yell at them and then ignore the yells and cries. She left to go to the store for a couple minutes, leaving me, my bf, and my friend alone to babysit them. Oh my god... when she left the sound went up 30 HZ. I only spent about 30 minutes with these kids and i was losing my mind. My friend has 3 kids herself, a bit older, but they are all much better behaved even if not the best. I do notice things like this more often due to my own poor upbringing. I could have ended up like these kids so i have definite sympathy and empathy when it comes to emotional issues. But when it remains unchecked then i just cant stand it. I dislike needy children because i know i dont have the energy for them, its not their fault but i prefer to stay on the sidelines. It takes a lot for me not to say some shit about it, tell their mom to get them into therapy or something. Its hard to observe kids like that with no real support to show them right.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I dont think draconians are reptiles because the reptiles are more lizard like, not as humanoid looking, and they have tails. But they are similar. Im not sure where i read this but i read that there are two subclasses of draconian, the evil ones, and the ones that wanted to fight back against the majority because they understood the destruction of races and the impact on the galactic neighborhood. They joined the other aliens in defense during the great war. That would make sense you were sensing the ones that broke off from the majority, especially if they have a sense of protection and honor, for what the believe to be as right. They may have fled to orion and established a new base or even joined other aliens and interbred if thats even possible, leading to a mixed race that makes it harder to identify.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Depending how you wear your pants might affect it. I always wore my pants on my lower waist and it created like a new area for the muffintop lol. Ive worse my pants like this for years, but other people seem to have that area distributed around them, not pushed up. Kinda like how a corset works, it pushes things around to be more shaped, instesd my pants made my body grow a muffintop cuz the fat couldnt go where my pants are. Also I've heard of "skinnyfat" which is what my cousin called herself, she was underweight but her belly had that little pouch. When she ate, all she ate was really not healthy, kinda sugary and lots of carbs based from potatoes because that was her go to. What we eat may cause fat distribution to be like that, but im not sure if working out or trying to redistribute that fat works after its already there. I'm sure theres a way to change it up to make it feel like it is less to you, but honestly i guess it would take a while for your body to learn.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>They also don't seem to have other hair much either, along with their darker skin to protect from their star's radiation, it could be a good idea to look for places that were arid and maybe dry based on feline and draconian conditions/behavior/needs then it makes sense for them to be in a place like that. Along with their lifestyle of wearing bones and fur, it makes sense that they would hunt and bear pride with the hunt, which both draconid and feline races would presumably have.</TEXT>

The jungle and desert is highly interest, as that would make draconian and feline interbreeding more likely, say the draconian originally settled the deserts but in those midlands they met the felines and began to intermingle, perhaps even creating another whole species that inhabits that part of the continent. Plenty of water for other species to be there as well.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Sounds like based on the sunset you are looking from the equatorial zone, also the atmospheric makeup for the planet sounds oxygen or nitrogen rich based on the color during the day. Our sun is relatively calm for such a big star, so a smaller star would be calm i assume, making it safer for the planet to be closer. Also the climate makes it easier to think it is closer just based on the higher temperatures and perhaps the planet orbits much faster than earth, making seasons or relative temperature higher based on how much light the planet is getting. Dang, now i need to know haha.</TEXT>

You will feel very groggy the first time you take it but it wears off slowly. They moved me to 10 mg over time but that ended up being way too much, i just wanted to sleep all day. Eventually i tried a combo of abilify and lexapro, my abilify is 2mg for the slight sedative effect and my lexapro is 10mg. Both of those are pretty low doses but i find minimal side effects besides vivid dreams/lack of sex drive.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I think I've suffered from dpdr my whole life. When i started smoking weed at 18, i felt everything at once. I feel weirdly backwards because weed is supposed to cause dpdr, not pull you out. I started learning who i am, what i am, my values, my identity. It started a really huge journey for me, about my mental state and emotional issues.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Honestly i think its disgusting but ill still have a cigarette or 2 a day. I usually vape but the extra additives in cigarettes make you feel more calm. For me, its just more socially acceptable to smoke a cig in public than a fat blunt. I transitioned from weed to nicotine bc of that. I dont even think its always the cigarette that i want, its just that moment of peace that you can get when you step out for a break. Its easier to say "imma go have a cig" than say "im tired of this shit, im gonna go stand outside by myself for 10 minutes"</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I held it together til i graduated high school. I took a gap year and it went south. I had lots of scholarships lined uo to a private christian university. I wasn't into that really, not being christian and not wanting to pay $40000 a year if i lost my scholarship. Plus they only covered $75000 for the first 4 years and that isnt enough, so in the middle of my stay i would have to come up with $75000 more. I was top 10 in my class of 400. Graduated 2017. Now i have nothing. No job, no car, living at my parents with my bf. My mental health went to shit. I ended up in a residential for 4 days while they figured me out and put me on meds. The meds help. But i still deal with issues that meds dont affect. I feel like the person in the past was a different me. A me in another lifetime, a me who could function. And now im nothing.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>My parents are both mentally ill, tldr basically. Cutting to the chase. Basically i feel like the only reason i did so well in school was to get attention that wasn't negative. I got praise, recognition somewhat for my hard work. I had adequate distraction doing my school work. I always did my honework as soon as i got home. Sometimes i would ask for two copies so i could do one and write the other one neater to make it more appealing. Over time however, my rewards and stuff became nothing to me, just normal. No sense of pride or satisfaction. I did have to work for some things, but most came easily. I studied even if i knew the work. My parents eventually saw my acheivements as normal and stopped rewarding me or even saying good job to me. I graduated top 10 with a 3.98 gpa, due to one B i got freshman year. After i graduated, i lost all sense of purpose. I didn't want to go to college, my mental health was already failing and debt didnt seem like a good choice. All the years of trying desperately to please my parents were for nothing.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I think the stress of it gave me pancreatitis once. After pancreatitis my insides have not been the same. I get sore in my lower left abdomen often, i cannot press or put any pressure there without it being a sharp pain. You know when you go to the doc and they do the stomach press thing? Yeah, agony. I have trouble with incontinence too after that. Im really hoping my pancreas didnt mess up the nerve bundles in there bc my lipase levels were 9000 and i didnt go to the hospital right away, i thought the pain was just gas bubbles or something. I still feel weird in that region. After a day or two, i felt like bees were in my colon, like it was bubbly and vibrating (?) Best way to describe it. I dont drink alcohol and wasnt on anything but birth control, so idk how i got it. The doctors chalked it up to a fatty diet, but whats funny is at that time i was trying out a diet and i was eating salad, baked chicken, mushrooms, stuff like that. I wasnt eating anything too spicy or compacting in the bowels. So i wasnt necessarily eating things like fast food or fried foods at all. So idiopathic at best. I had a small bout a couple weeks ago but with bowel rest it helped. I recommend that if you get pains, try to fast for at least 2 or 3 days. Drink a ton of water, yes you will be ravenously hungry, but that time where your guts get rest will help heal and relax them. Start off eating with broth, jello, light thing, and each day work up to more hearty foods. Stick away from things that are too spicy. Im sure i should have got it checked out but when i went to my follow up with my regular doctor, they recommended me work on my mental health first and it started a huge thing with going to therapy 2 times a week and having appts with my psychiatrist 1 time a month, so some weeks would have crammed 3 therapy sessions in one. I didnt have time to check out my bowels.</TEXT>

But sometimes i feel weird abt this, he will let me hang out with everyone while he's with his friends, but there's ONE single friend he doesnt want me to meet. I know its a dude and i trust my bf so that isnt the issue. The issue is, why do i get to hang with everyone else but not them? Like its the one friend he hangs with that i cant go over.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Every emotion is very extreme, or either nothing at all. Each person with BPD has a different experience but this is mine. I went my entire childhood with no emotions. No attachment to anything, probably close to how you feel. Once i graduated high school, it all flooded in, every emotion i denied myself. Once i hit that point, i couldn't function. The real world was too painful, too hateful, anxiety inducing. I would say i am "quiet bpd" which means instead of taking my emotions out on others, i took it out on myself. I would hit myself, and much worse. I tried starving myself. But nothing gave me control. I ended up in a mental hospital for 4 days and got me into treatment. Treatment for me was quite rigorous, i still need it tbh. I was in DBT for 8 months and on meds with it. I've never denied having bpd though, which is where your mother and i differ. You cant help someone if they dont acknowledge they even have an issue. +just because you have bpd doesn't make it an excuse to shit on people. Yes, i have been toxic and shit to people. But through therapy im learning what is right and what isnt. Your mother may never change her ways without the realization they're toxic. Sometimes the best you can do, is ignore her. A lot of things will come with that, but living with her im sure you know what to expect, right? Her being very upset, blaming you for her shortcomings. Dont fall for that trap. Many people with bpd are like that, but many arent. Its easy to differentiate after you get to see their behavior. Some people with BPD are almost a lost cause if they don't acknowledge the presence of something off.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I know, but i don't know how. I wasn't trying to justify, just explain. I can't justify anything i do really. The way i was raised, i basically raised myself. So my coping methods aren't the best, but the problem is i am self aware of everything you just said, but i dont know the *how* part to control it. Its almost like being in another body where you are aware what they are doing but have no control. This is hard for someone without mental illness to understand. It doesnt limit to smoking, it goes beyond to even speaking. Yes, i know you can get the calm from other places, but how? That same hit. Plus smoking isn't only a physical addiction, its mental. The act of smoking, putting something to your lips, is part of it. A lot of people dont know that.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Yes that is somewhat true. I actively know what i want to do, but my emotions will cloud judgement and really make it hard to do the "right" thing, whatever it may be. It takes a lot of hard work. Usually what helps when im upset is validation. I wont go off nearly as much if someone says, "I understand why you feel that way, it must be really hard." This is called validation. Even if you dont understand really, or you dont think its that hard, you can still give validation. Just make it sound sincere There are some things that you shouldn't validate however. Its kinda complicated so I'll give an example i got from therapy: "Imagine a child falls off the bike. He is upset. You can validate why he is upset, of course he may have a scrape and it sucks to fall. That's understandable. But say the child no longer wants to ride his bike *ever again*. That is also understandable, but not something you want to validate, because that is an extreme reaction to a minor incident." This is something a lot of BPD people don't receive, and usually validation is what caused our issues in the first place. BPD is thought to originate from childhood traumas, not being able to accurately express yourself or being ridiculed for very minor things. Also it might not be one event but rather many many small ones over time that lead to the development. BPD is close to PTSD, minus the one huge factor that PTSD can be traced to one or two major events. BPD develops over time. The things you can do to help are things that seem quite simple but are very impactful, like shooting a text message saying you care , or just being able to tell your mom that you understand (even if you don't really.) There is a tipping point where you feel like you can help deeply, but really there is nothing you can do besides offer support. The work has to come from within the BPD person to really see a change.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Most regular people find validation useful to build their identity, but mostly as a baby. As a baby, forms of validation come like feeding you when you cry, playing with you, and showing you the way without judgement. But when you don't get this as a child, it leaves you empty and searching for it forever in others. Most normal people are able to validate themselves, like you have a good way to do that with how you describe what you do. You are able to validate yourself efficiently. Usually DBT therapy is what teaches people with BPD to search within themselves rather than others. It stems from never having a stable parental figure. Even as BPD, acting is a core of our recovery. We have to act "normal" essentially to heal, opposite action is the skill that can be related to. Say i am upset, so i will pretend i am not, meanwhile still allowing myself to feel upset. That way it doesn't bottle up and manifest in other unhealthy ways, if that makes sense at all. I'm sure it would help some BPD people if you shared how you validate yourself, because there are many different things that work. But for some, they wouldn't grasp it. It really depends on the individual. In DBT there are so many coping skills because not just one will fix us all. You have to relate to it and find actual meaning for it to stick, personally i just try to stick to the facts, like i know i am worthy so i don't need someone to tell me so. Then i will list all the things that make me worthy. But most people with BPD will need therapy for life, since it can only be put into "remission" rather than "cured." It is a personality disorder, unlike a chemical inbalance or mood disorder, many medications will not help with the intricacies, and you have to literally re-parent yourself.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Its kinda complicated lol. I probably would just out of respect since hiding my scars is something i can control. I might feel offended by it though. But if they tell me to hide something i cant control (weight, face, etc) i wouldn't. I do feel like it is their issue for being triggered by it since i can't hold responsibility for someone being triggered simply by existing in the same space. It was not my intention to trigger them by wearing short sleeves/shorts, so i can't be responsible. But that isn't a negative thing, just a thing they have to work on, because you have to be able to handle things like that. You cant tell everyone to hide their scars for example, so learning to not be triggered or find a better reaction is safer in the long run.</TEXT>

One of them fucked off after i told him no, unfortunately the other one tried to convince me to start one lmao.</TEXT>

One time she hit me with a wooden broom stick right on my head and then ran like i was fine. I was not fine. My mom found me passed out outside 5 minutes later with blood streaming down my face. What did she say? "Your sister didnt mean to, she's too young to know any better." Fuck off, the look in her eyes was evil.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Yes, I'm very anxious about food in general and how people percieve me eating. I am overweight and have been since age 7, I'm still working on it at age 20. I used to skip meals at school due to the pressure of what people would think to see a fat person eating more. I don't even know where my hatred came from, because my mom never said anything about my weight, but i have been bullied for it before, so probably that. I just got to the point in high school where i would take my food and eat in the library to avoid dpdr while eating. But then it didnt always help. Now i just accept the dpdr and eat regardless, but that doesn't help all the time either. If I'm at a restaurant or a party and im eating while holding a conversation, it just drops off because i have to say "what?" a thousand times or i stop responding altogether. When I eat its like i go into robot mode. "Put food in mouth, chew, swallow, repeat" I feel no enjoyment until I'm done and i feel full. Undoubtedly dpdr during eating has contributed to being overweight for me nowadays, because if i don't ration something out, I'll just keep eating until i feel sick because i just literally am not in touch with my body.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>For me, weed did the opposite. I struggled from trauma induced dpdr before i smoked weed at 18. It brought me a lot of knowledge about myself and allowed me to process my emotions. I really don't know how. My advice to you, is try CBD? Or if you have means to knowing the real strain, indica vs sativa, etc, then it will be safer to try out and see if its a certain weed that does it to you. Maybe also try smoking less at first, don't keep smoking until you feel bad, just get a very small buzz and then wait 20 minutes, then take another hit. That way you know your limit and then can smoke to that point, but be careful with potent strains.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>These may be "brain shimmers" or "zaps" that some people describe on certain SSRI's. Fluoxetine is one of the main ones that cause it. Basically your brain is firing up everywhere and overloads itself for an instant. You probably feel irritated by it because it is literally overstimulation. It can sometimes flood out a little extra serotonin and that causes the same issues too.</TEXT>

I trimmed them and filed them short cuz i dont want claws lmao and then i painted them and i started by trying not to touch them at all but gave in to picking off the nail polish, then the glue around the nail, then i bite the nail and once it falls off i put a new one on. Repeat. I go thru a nail pack every 2 weeks or so but i think a couple dollars is worth my nails not hurting like hell.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>There are natural ways to stop panic attacks and xanax is a highly addictive substance. Also, you don't have to stop panic attacks before you work on general anxiety and the general anxiety is going to be there more. You can have a panic attack and feel okay in an hour. I'm not sure if you're saying it's like you have to stop having panic attacks before you stop having anxiety? Yes but it's not literally able to be helped in that way it's a lot more complicated. Maybe you're a little fuzzy on panic attack vs anxiety attack? They're different but pretty much the same thing is going to help, not xanax as that literally is like a pain pill. Natural ways to help anxiety are really the only ways that work, and you have to train your body to react differently through your neurons.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Number one, i went through literal therapy designed for people with emotional regulation issues and anxiery falls on that list. I have no idea how I'm I'm normalizing a medical disorder by saying you can feel okay in an hour. That's true. You can have anxiety and have panic attacks and feel okay sometimes? And yes you stated xanax stops panic attacks but where you went off the loop is when you said you have to stop you panic attacks before you work on anxiety. However you negelcted the the context that if the person is in denial and doesnt know then that's different. Plus i believe you can not know what a panic attack is but you definitely know you're having one. Edit: saying you can "just work through" it IS NOT EVEN what im saying. You have to work HARD AS HELL. It's not an invalidation. There is LITERAL THERAPY BUILT TO HELP YOU WORK THROUGH IT. DRUGS ARE NOT A CURE. Im not even anti drug! They're there as a means to help not to rely on completely.</TEXT>

    <DATE>2020-07-17 02:25:44</DATE>
    <TEXT>Usually i don't hang around a lot of people, maybe 3 or 4 friends i will hang out with regularly with 1 being closer than the rest. But either way i noticed that all my friends have like severe emotional trauma. Like my best friend was adopted by a crazy christian lady who basically tortured her and my other friend didn't have a good childhood either to say the very least. It's like i always feel like i havent been as traumatized as them but then again why do i always make friends with traumatized individuals? I must be close or the same level of messed up lol. Plus when i was in middle/high school i remember the friends i had with parents always had messed up parents (like alcohol, drugs, bad step parent, etc) and my mom would always befriend them anyway. Like i cant relate to a neurotypical and most of the time i become friends with someone to find out later they've got trauma of some kind. Like i just plain don't hit it off with neurotypical people even if i don't know they are. I think i repress a lot of my trauma, like i can remember some parts of childhood but they don't give me any feelings. Like it wasn't me that it happened to? Like i was just witnessing it thru my eyes? Idk how to explain that any better tbh.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>For op or anyone else, the way to know psilocybin mushies is a spore print. Cut a piece of the cap or a whole cap of the mushroom off as close to the cap as you can, place it flat on a piece of white paper or paper towel, set a cup over it. And leave it. If the mushroom is old enough, it will drop purple spores. A light violet color. Anything else is skeptical so be careful!</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Mostly true i think! I believe the main psilocybin genus is purely purple, while good subs will be varying colors. If you have purple, you're purely golden, but any other colors, it's a gamble because so many mushrooms look the same. At that point, if you have 2 black spore prints and they both look trippy, you may have a type of gallerina or you may have a type of psytharella, but there's only one you wanna eat... At that point you have to observe the spore at microscopic levels and im currently saving for a good microscope and not the toy ones at walmart lol. Edit: i found some psilocybin allenii somewhere near a place i go and i washed them at home with cold water, my hands started tripping! The cold water started feeling warm, but if i let the stream hit my arm it was still cold, such a weird feeling. That's how i knew they were good!</TEXT>

    <TEXT>A lot of places I go, the ATMs are out of cash so you can't withdraw money, you have to go in the bank or get cash back from the store. Also i don't follow the news at all but is there a small bill and coin shortage right now? A lot of the smaller shops and gas stations in my town have signs saying they need coins/$1/$5 bills. Very strange cuz i don't think that ever really happens? Im seeing these signs more and more often, its like they're getting people ready for no money? Obviously right now they're all trying to push these mobile banking apps and bitcoin is sorta getting more popular with lower level and beginner stock marketing people just trying to cash in real quick. (Don't know how that's doing with the recent economy troubles though tbh.) I just don't see a reason why there would be a shortage of cash and coin because maybe people are stockpiling? Or just not ever using cash anymore? Something to consider where i am at, i live in washington state so the recreational marijuana shops only take cash. Lots of people have change on them. Places like dollar tree are short on change and dollars?</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Mission statement: Me noticing this i dont think its normal to have so many places short on change and small bills when rec weed makes a lot of change and is popular, also with the fact the homeless here spend there money there and they don't exactly have big bills... Observation at least 5+ stores in my town that get lots of traffic have this issue.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>When my bf and i get into a spat, literally more than half the time i end up being right about something and he swears he is. It's very stupid things like what day we went to the store or road directions, like left or right at the stop. I'm right so much of the time and i literally just say he is right in order to stop us from progressing into a full blown argument. Like last night i told him to turn right at the red light and he literally told me it was the wrong way and it wasn't because the highway was literally the next left turn. The times I'm actually wrong is so rare that it surprises me so i end up making it into a joke that he was actually right for once in my mind and i say sorry to him, but i dont think he ever really says sorry or admits it to me. It kinda drives me crazy cuz he says how im smart and he admits he has a shitty memory! Then argues whether who remembers right. I'm this  #128076; close to keeping a literal log of our day to prove when things happened and what i said, etc...</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Things keep getting shittier. Usually the urge passes after a couple days but it's been a solid 3 months. At this point I'm only alive in order to not hurt my bf, and eat food. There is nothing i find enjoyable anymore except showers and eating, and i cant do those all the time. Plus someone tried to steal my debit card info so i had to get a new card and i havent had access to my money in 5 days bc it hasn't sent yet. I don't have any way to go do anything bc of gas in my car and i barely have food. It would be so easy to do it tonight. I could just drink the moonshine in the cabnet and be done with this shit in 10 minutes. I could just put on some music, sit in the bathtub, and do it. In the past i have been actively suicidal but its never felt like this. Most of the time it passes but it hasnt. Ive ran out of coping mechanisms and ive been exhausted for weeks.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I've been working on this for 8 months and I'm finally sitting down and thinking about it. Like 99% of the time I'm around my mom, she is either gossiping or complaining about something I didn't do/didn't do "right." And 99% I literally don't look at her or respond. And she will keep right on going. I know at first greyrocking takes time but I seriously don't think my mom even f*cking cares! She will keep talking at me like a damn robot, getting progressively more and more annoying or offensive until i walk away. And if I don't walk away, I certainly end up feeling like crap. When I was younger, she would egg me on to get me upset because I didn't know better. Now I get upset because it's literally annoying. I live with her, even though our house is big enough and our schedules don't line up, every meeting with her is so draining and nothing seems to work except completely not even being around her at all. And that's unavoidable sometimes. I never ever care about anything she says. I cannot conversate with her without it coming full circle to a lecture, criticism, or something i don't even need to worry about.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>So, you have to bring it up to him. Try it very lightly, act like you are not nervous or insecure and BE SURE to remember the truth because he will probably lie. Don't call him out or he might start to be immediately defensive. If he really loves you and finds value in your relationship, he will stop/down. It may take 2 or 3 times of the talk to do it but he will. If he doesnt, leave, because there is no help, and literally the weight of the burden of not feeling wanted will crush you. Tell him the problem he has and why, maybe he will understand, make sure he knows how it makes you feel as well. He will be very ashamed so he might lie just because of that. Make him feel like he doesn't have to hide this and say you're willing to work with him. State the facts, like you found the browser history, the lube bottle, everything. He can't really argue.</TEXT>

But sometimes its really conflicted, the very few good moments in my life at the time i felt okay but looking back its so sad that i had to find happiness those ways. I only remember 3 of those moments but sometimes certain smells or vibes can bring back forgotten feelings i cant even tie to a memory. Like last week i smelled someone's air spray in their car and i don't know what it was but i definitely know that smell and it took me to a time i dont even remember, but it felt overwhelming.

    <TEXT>Of course it isn't "okay" cuz u are self harming but it depends on the severity more i would say. Like 50 regular cuts vs 50 deep cuts is very different. Also depending on the area you cut in. Good job for being clean so long! You've gotten over the most hard part so i believe that u are able to keep going! For myself i would say that's average for myself because i take up large areas with normal cuts instead of doing a couple deep ones. But that makes infection more likely so its a little dangerous. Everyone is different but i would say that 50 is a larger number since more people i think would prefer less with more depth but like i said i guess it would just depend. I agree with your therapist though. It is a lot easier to practice harm reduction than to just stop for most people. But for some people its easier cold turkey cuz you're not "teasing" yourself so to say. For example you could still do 50, just try to make them small or very shallow. You can even try other numbers that you feel comfy with as long as it is less each time, but that makes you feel like you can keep doing it vs cold turkey it's off limits.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>The problem isn't masturbation itself but the porn that he was addicted to. Basically he didn't even want me, he would rather masturbate than ever have any intimacy with me. As a female, there's a stigma that if everything but the sex is good, people will see you as shitty because you left them just based on sex. But it's more than that, it's just a feeling of being unwanted. So to me, i wouldn't have cared as much if he didn't use the porn or lie to me about it. Masturbating itself is not bad if you're not cranking 3 out a day.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Honestly same, i like drag queens, feminine males, masculine females, transgirls, really anyone that doesn't fit a gender norm is cool to me and i can find them sexually appealing. The difference is i am not romanticizing or fetishizing them. Like i say i like them but i dont specifically seek out those people only to be with, i don't make derogatory or nasty comments, i respect everyone. I think it is not transphobic in any way, although past a degree it can be fetishizing which is not good either. But it doesnt sound like you're doing that.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Don't smoke for 3 days, drink a gallon of water each day, and use a cleanse. Drink it 3 hrs before u pee and it can come out clean regardless how much you smoked. Try not to lose any weight because thc sticks to fat and losing weight will release more into your blood. I peed for my janitor job and i had been smoking 2 yrs straight every day flower/dabs and that still got me a pass.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Also with wrestling do not forget it isnt all about strength but also how you use it. Some small wrestlers could beat a big wrestler just from speed and agility and proper leverage. He's trained in knowing how to use his weight and strength in a way you aren't necessarily used to or trained to combat either. So he was probably as strong as you (or maybe more) and also used it well.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Depending on where it is, i may be able to help. I have nerve issues in my neck from an injury when i was younger that cases migraines and neck pain and i cant move my head when this happens. You know the Gatorade bottles that are shaped kinda like concave in the middle? It cradles my neck nicely and i warm it up slightly and lay on it. I lay flat on the floor and put it nestled by my skull and it stretches that section of vertebrate out enough to relieve some of it. Maybe if you have like a foam roller instead of rolling try to relax yourself onto it on your back or neck, wherever u need it. You don't actively have to massage yourself unless your muscles are so stiffened you need some stimulation, usually some deep breathing and lightening up those muscles holding it will help.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I feel guilty for getting so angry but being hyperaware for so many years made me better at these things, to my detriment. When it comes to things like basic common sense to me, apparently it isn't to other people. Like just ideas or ways to solve a problem. I always have an idea to solve a problem we're having but it seems like nobody takes it seriously until it's the last option. It drives me crazy when it ends up working and we spent like an hour on it before. It makes me hate having this skill, i wish i didn't have the ability to reason this fast and be able to think things out so precisely. Stuff that comes with physics or maneuvering, cooking, spacial reasoning. (I would be rich if i had a nickel for every time i told my dad something would/wouldn't fit in a certain spot.) I don't even have a passion for anything yet my attention to details could be honed and honestly i just don't want to. Yeah i guess working towards it would bring me to people with like minds but i know for a fact that i would still feel just as bad everywhere else.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>In HS i became friends with a new girl (18) i was 15. She wuickly got attached to me so i felt like it was safe to get attached to her. With my BPD im very guarded unless this person seems good to my brain and she did, unfortunately. We were best friends literally best friends for a solid year. That wasn't long considering i was friends with my other ones for 3 years. Well she ended up getting rejected by her crush snd started dating a friend from my group and just completely forgot about me, i dont even think it was fair even looking back now. I made mistakes too but she was 18 and knew what she did wrong. I plead her to not leave me but we just never hung out and she always was with him. But one day i was at my other friends house and her n her bf walked by and saw us hanging out (small town. He lived on the main road.) And she got salty cuz i was hanging out with him not her. After that i gave up. She apparently spread around the school during summer that i was obsessed and a lesbian for her, disregarding the fact that we were only friends for a whole year and she was just as obsessed with me before she got with him as a rebound. They broke up later.</TEXT>

It feels like a dissociated fever dream. Something abt that resonates. Obvs the similar feeling in pocket camp came up since that was the next AC game i played since i was like 7.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>In cali sometimes the police themselves protect meth labs n traffickers out there, look up the case of Jon Aujay. He went hiking out in the desert and ended up going missing. Most people believed he wouldn't ever go missing bc of the terrain or anything and 1 single gunshot was heard that night but no sign of Jon. Later stuff came out but if the police aren't involved it's most likely a 411 considering no other evidence at all, they even thermal scanned the whole area.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Yeah, when i got therapy i slowly started to see that while i was toxic, i never took it to the point my mom or sister did. Being surrounded by toxic people your whole life just makes it where you don't know, but once you know,you have a choice. I chose to stop but some people don't and that's on them! But it just sucks when people think we are always the bad ones because sometimes our reactions can simply be because our immediate friends/family are invalidating or narcissistic. My bf shows tendencies but over time he is learning, it took a lot of deep conversation and arguments sometimes but it was civil and we got to the point... eventually lol.</TEXT>

My mom would always do that to me when i was already planning to get up or she would wake me an hour early knowing there wasnt a rush. She also loves to keep the whole house at like 60 degrees and i am anemic so i get so cold. The blanket was warm and my safe dark warm place. Much more inviting than her womb. So when obviously imagine getting out of a warm bath into the cold air but while you're half awake. It's really jarring.</TEXT>

My emcounter i went out into the woods with my bf near mt rainier and chose a random forest road to hike down. 3 miles in and i smell something disgusting, like rotten onion and skunk soup. My bf smelled nothing so we kept going. I then hear a crack in the brush to the left in the thick trees where they get really fat, and i just feel a feeling that i needed to run, immediately. The fear hit me when i smelled the smell but not as intensely. Its a fear like no other i genuinely did not think of anything else except telling my bf to turn around and go. I explained to him once we got back to the car and he said he felt nothing the whole way but he did notice that there were like no animals, considering september is a time for some active birds at least.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I was 4 by the time my mom had my sister and i think it was seriously so my mom could pawn us off on each other, she would have me "play" with her and watch her so we both stayed out of her hair. As i got older, i was always subjected to watching my sister or her friends or my cousins all around her age (6-10) while i was i a teen. They drove me nuts. None of them respected me because they saw the adults didn't. Then the adults got mad when me, a child myself, couldn't control 5 disrespectful brats. Loved it when they used to say, "this is good birth control!!" To 14 year old me, a virgin. Lmao they got what they wanted forever now! At this point, my mom always berated me for still not wanting to play with my sister, who was 10 at the time, me 14, she's playing dolls. Number one i never liked feminine things and my sister never wanted to play with me, always me with her. So i had no choice but to play dumb games i didn't want to.</TEXT>

She died at 98, she honesty wasn't very nice but she took care of me when i was a kid so obviously i loved her. There's always a chance of survival, but also remember that there isn't. Just don't dwell on it when you're around her. When you get time with her try to spend it in the moment. Make memories. Otherwise you will be too sad to enjoy the time you have with her and you will deeply deeply regret not making those laughs/good times. Of course its okay to be sad a little bit but overall try to just make her feel normal. After all she is going through shit too, and you have the chance to help her feel peace.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Even though I knew about PMDD and why it happens, it never occured to me that I could have extra estrogen along with other hormonal issues. The symptoms for it are pretty spot on, including the weird stuff i struggle from like feeling cold all the time, memory issues, and also especially sleeping too much. When i was younger and hit puberty i was put on meds for hypothyroidism as well, and now my thyroid levels are lower end normal. Apparently that isn't scientifically normal, and now I'm thinking perhaps it was the abundance of estrogen at that time causing my problems and once it evened out a bit i felt better but still had more issues. I really wish i had known sooner so i can ask my dr to do a hormone level test for me. I'm really interested in what my levels are at this point, because its been getting so much worse and my last period was over a month late.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Both my parents were so emotionally absent, i was expected to be everyone's parent and emotional rock. It really messed me up so i totally understand what you mean. My mom and dad would always drink and often ended up passed out in pissy pants, their weird friends would still be hanging around and I never felt safe basically. Me and my sister would lock ourselves in our room cuz most the time my dad was at work or drinking and my mom was just... mean. You know. The type of mean that's not physical but so vindictive that she'd kill you with words and emotional neglect. However once my sister started to get teenaged she began to become more like them so i don't feel bad about leaving them, no matter how hard they try to get me back. She's a huge manipulator and thief, also underage and promiscuous with old men online. My mom always said "i hope you have kids that act like you" as an insult when i didnt do anything for her. Jokes on her, none will be made, and in the one universe they are made, i would want them to be like me as a kid because i was good and my mom was just a b*tch.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I must say, the youngest has their own set of troubles if your parents pawned you off on your older sibling. Obviously you're not being parented either way, but possibly worse if you're the younger sibling because the older one is unable to carry an adult responsibility for you anyways so you end up codependent and misguided.</TEXT>

    <TITLE>Guys that have recovered, do you feel insecure that you don't last as long now? (Tw for mentions of sexual details)</TITLE>
    <DATE>2020-08-23 07:25:13</DATE>
    <TEXT>Tldr: Im a girl and my bf has insecurity that he doesn't last long enough after recovery. But im fine with it and i keep telling him. How do i help him understand/be comfortable? I know this is probably just something toxic he engraved into his mind from the idea in porn that all girls want and or can have sex for long periods of time. But this is simply unrealistic. I feel like he had a bit of his ego tied to lasting so long with me despite me telling him it was too long several times. He cannot understand that i also get pleasure from things other than his d. Before, he had PIED and if he would get it up then it would take an hour to get the job done, with any method, so it was tiring. Often it would resort to him doing it himself because i just couldn't. I actually hated it because i felt like i had to keep going or he would be unsatisfied and just finish to porn. It felt horrible to keep going when i lost interest 30 minutes ago, but i just wanted to make sure he didnt resort to porn. Now that he doesn't watch porn he will bust within 5 minutes. I am actually just fine with this, because sex gets painful for me pretty quickly. Im satisfied even if i dont get a climax because i dont have sex for the climax, i do it for intimacy. But he has it stuck in his head that he isn't pleasuring me because he no longer lasts forever. I've communicated a lot around this subject with him, he also doesn't seem to understand that i get pleasure from things other than plain penetration. So he kicked his addiction but a lot of the toxic mindset is still in him, how do i help him feel more comfortable?</TEXT>

My sister could do NO WRONG in her eyes, yet everything i did was wrong. I had to be the "bigger" person and yet when i was, i did something wrong either way. Now im scared to do anything cuz if i dont do it perfect then i feel like im going to get emotionally punished. As soon as i got privacy my mom would make comments to me that there was stuff to do and if i didnt do it that exact second she would get so manipulative.</TEXT>

Also if its an accident then tell them that you've looked up some info and its not from drinking before you go to bed. Bedwetting at an older age means that your body doesn't take in enough oxygen and it lets the muscles go to conserve it, so it genuinely is a medical issue.</TEXT>

Why not let her get older then find out her own label? Why say a kid is lgbt this young simply because she finds the girls pretty? As a kid i didnt like anybody. I didnt have a crush at all until i was 14. And even then i didnt understand it! If my parents had raised me saying i was asexual because i showed no interest in anyone then how would that have affected my psyche? There's a difference between letting a child explore/let them know its okay and straight up labeling them or forcing an ideal upon a developing mind.</TEXT>

It's super hard when you've been raised in a family that propagates keeping your feelings private. Maybe showing their cuts/scars is the way they need help and their family is not taking it seriously. It's really upsetting when you have a conversation with someone and you DO communicate your needs but you have to keep repeating it every single day to get them. It feels like begging.

    <TEXT>My bf struggles with it too. Before we realized what was going on, we binged together. We would go to a fast food place and literally binge. Neither of us thought about what the other was doing, we were just eating. And then seperately when we binged we never knew. He does feel shame about it but not like a huge level and he doesn't hate himself as much as i do for it, but that might come down to the fact that overweight men are not looked at the same way as overweight women most of the time. He also doesn't care that he has it. I've told him that it may be a problem since he is getting health issues and i told him what he is doing and why. He agreed with me so we're working together on it, but he also said he wouldn't care if i didn't care. He would not call it a disorder. So maybe a lot of guys just don't ever think about their emotion/ food consumption and tie them together? So it makes it harder for guys with this problem to seek support since a lot of guys just dont care and keep eating.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Thought it was gas at first, my upper left stomach under the ribs kept having an itchy pang feeling, just uncomfortable. This was about 4 or 5 hours and i had a meal before i napped. Once i laid down to take a nap, it still didn't hurt super bad but i got up and felt very nauseous and tried to use some pepto bismol. My nap lasted like 3 hours and i was laying on my back so that might have made it worse since my stomach was full and laying on my pancreas. Mistakes were made lol i threw up the pepto and the pain started. Just burning searing like someone stuck a hot knife in between my ribs through my back. By the time we were at the emergency room i was in fetal position leaning forward because it was only thing that eased it even a little. Couldnt drink water even so after i told them that, triage brought me back immediately and got me hooked up. After that i was good, just lots of pain even after the meds and more fluids. Never wanna do it again. Now once i get those tiny itchy pangs i stop eating and drink only in hopes of stopping it.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I think i saw somewhere that pancreatic pain can be caused by an autoimmune problem, so your levels end up being normal but you're hurting. Also i know that trauma can bring a lot of body function that people don't know about, maybe the trauma caused your body to start releasing too much cortisol and now it's stuck in attack mode. The pancreas is an organ that gets attacked more rarely so its hard for me to find more info. My pancreas problems started right after a huge trauma to me, my levels were high then but now they're normal and i still get pain maybe 3 times a month.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Most people that have said this to me simply do not respect animals or do not understand that cats are not dogs. They have dogs that constantly have health issues or other issues because they don't respect them. Yes the dog licks you and gets happy to see you, because you feed it. A cat just has to learn respect for you and if you don't treat him with respect then oh well. The cat doesn't like you. Some cats just don't like affection period and show love in other ways, all dogs kinda show it the same. All my cats like me because i literally treat them with the same respect i would a roommate. I say excuse me and they move. I say good kitty, they're happy. I play with them then they curl up next to me and nap. It's just a matter of giving them respect. If a person cannot show respect to even an animal then that shows either power issues or empathy issues and idk if i wanna be friends with someone like that.</TEXT>

On the surface i find kids pretty cool and nice, i will play with them and make cheer and whatever else. Like i dont actively have hate in my heart for kids, its just easier to say than explaining a whole emotional feeling for it. I dont sneer at children when they pass. I don't do mean things to them. I don't treat them any different than another person. I actually enjoy small moments with children and making them laugh and stuff, but i hate kids. I would never have a kid. As soon as the kid starts getting unpleasant i leave. And that's my right because i am not their parent. If i was, then i wouldn't be able to step away. So thats why i will not have kids.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Currently along the process of checking my GI tract, my next appt is september 14. I have done a lot of reading. Most of the stuff happening to me seems to be like yours, i cant find any information that really enlightens me or anything and im losing weight and my hair is thinning. My blood is also very thin despite not being anemic. I feel like the doctors arent caring enough because im not actively "sick" and i iust have pain and bowel movement issues. I have had glandular issues in the past. When i was 10 the doctor diagnosed me with hypothyroidism and i took meds until i was 17 and they made me feel funny. So i went back and i hadnt taken the meds for months and they said my levels were low normal. I looked up how hypothyroidism can reverse itself and found nothing. I have no idea whats going on with my body. You are not alone.</TEXT>

I definitely can see how this would happen scientifically but also spiritually. There's a lot out there saying that sleep paralysis everyone sees these entities but why does everyone see the same type of things? Is it just our brain wiring or is really there and we are seeing a glimpse of another dimension?</TEXT>

    <TEXT>The kinect works off of like uv light right? It projects a gird of uv light around the room and it is able to read you through the data where the light ends or how much refects back to the sensor. So instead of sensing your face it kinda senses your general location based on that. Also the theory with it is maybe some energies/spirits interfere with the spectrum that the kinect uses so it senses them and you.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>The hardest part is understanding that you have to treat yourself like a kid. Look up reparenting. It might help you feel less alone and then you can narrow down more things that you can help with. Of course this doesn't fix it forever and is a constant work in progress. Like if you're feeling sad pretend you're a kid again and say to yourself what you wish someone would have said to you. Really try to absorb it, it might seem cheesy at first, but self compassion goes so long.</TEXT>

They're suffering because they don't even know what they don't have. They have no idea what they're missing. Imagine growing up like this and then ending up getting lucky enough to live averagely in a richer country. Imagine how much hate and regret and shame you would harbor knowing what you had then and what you have now, the fact that you could have had this and more from the beginning but you were deprived. You didn't miss it then because you didn't know what was even out there. But if you did, you would have offed yourself. Idk it just feels horrible to me to imagine that.</TEXT>

    <TITLE>I only feel comfortable with she/her but i don't feel completely cis? (TW slight sexual mentions)</TITLE>
    <DATE>2020-08-28 00:57:09</DATE>
    <TEXT>I'm biologically female. I don't prefer he/him but if someone mistakes me i dont care enough to correct them unless they do it over and over. It kinda just doesnt feel like *me* being called he/him. I feel comfortable with she/her but everything else about me is just not feminine. Im not even into labels so im genuinely just curious why i feel this way or if anyone else does? I hate looking feminine, i dont prefer make up or any colors that look feminine, i hate female made clothes. I dont particularly enjoy my chest (especially) or body, i have inclinations to bind but i have no idea what my boyfriend or anyone would say about that because i would still go by she/her but be binding. Basically i feel like i look like I'm trans but i dont identity as fully trans? And i dont wanna put a bad name on the community for this or "confuse" anyone? Also TW part: im fine with my vag and stuff but sometimes i really wish i was not female and sometimes i fantasize about being a male with my bf. Like i have a peen and we get it on and he doesnt judge me. But in real life i know he isn't gay and wouldn't enjoy it so i try to repress that because i love him so much and wouldn't want that to ruin us. He isn't comfy with that type of stuff but he does accept that i dont want to look "female" and still finds me attractive so im grateful. Idk maybe it comes down to the way society views gender, yes i am biologically female and identify as female but i dont like my breasts, body, feminine things in general like jewelry or clothes, idk. Like if i put on female clothes it just makes me feel disgusting and fake. Makeup feels the same unless its my eyebrows. Everything about me screams not cis but i still identify with my biological pronouns so i am confused i guess.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Maybe just unpopular in my family and friends, but everyone around me is obsessed with the "real" world; meaning everything going on in MSM and interpersonal relationships that mean nothing to me, useless stories, skills developed neither for experience nor practicality, advice that means nothing to me as a younger individual. What even is the real world? I feel like people who create their own spaces get judged very harshly for it, ex. someone who has a safe space with stuffed animals, someone who creates a blog about their favorite game, etc. I feel like if someone isn't seen as "productive" in societal standards then they're not "living in the real world." What's wrong with that? Maybe some people take it too far and self sabotage, but the majority of people engage in mindless activities all the time. Just because someone does it more often than you, does not mean they aren't in reality, they just aren't in yours. Real is subjective!</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I felt stupid when my therapist told me this cuz it seems so obvious but to me it wasnt. Basically check the facts lmao. Just kinda seperate yourself from the situation and count the things you did that are useful or made you feel good. It is subjective so this can be anything you believe has a good impact on your feeling of accomplishment. She said really look at all the things you did and count them out, it's probably more than you realize. On a really depressed day, getting out of bed is enough for me, so why should i keep dwelling on the fact that i did more, but "not enough?" After that, i started to write down my small accomplishments along with my goals to meet so i could see in reality what i felt was making me feel acheived. So say i needed to clean up the house or fill out a certain amount of resumes and only got half of it done. Instead of focusing on the half not done, i analyzed what i did and tried to see the extra stuff i hadn't noticed, like i pet my cat for a long time and she appreciated it.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Im still exploring but i feel attached to adromedan energies. I feel like i have a lot of love in me but i dont share it freely unless it is for animals or children, adults have to earn it moreso. I think the main characteristic is that love and willingness to help and provide safety, guiding others to make their journey easier. Sometimes i fall really hard though and the energies overcome me, both good and bad.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>My mom and I saw hippie ghosts. We were driving down our driveway (rural southern AZ) and its like a long dirt road and it just goes to our house and dead ends. There was only room for our car really, the sides were lined with barbed wire fences. We were coming back from the store at like 5 pm and the sun was kinda going down but still bright. We saw a small toyota type car coming towards us and we were like wtf because nobody we knew had a car like that and they were coming from our house. My dad was home and didn't notice anyone and there's nowhere to turn around unless you go around the loop in the front yard. As the small toyota passed, my mom scooted the car over as much as possible and they went by. Im aware of how dumb this sounds but as they went by, they were nodding their head and one of them made a peace sign to us. Think like cheech and chong looking but very real and not a movie and kinda scary. We were literally so confused. It was a scene straight out of the 70s. The car, their clothes, the driver had like a bandana tying his curly shoulder length hair up and his shirt was green and collared with orange ornate twirls on it. Then the other guy was wearing a blue chambray type shirt with the top button undone and he had some sort of bracelet on. He was the one doing the peace sign. The driver was nodding his head more. Now, the house we lived in was just a trailer and im sure it wasnt there for more than 35 years, so i have no idea if this was some weird ghosts saying hi to us or if we just saw some literal hippies in the desert leaving our house. They felt intelligent as they moved their car over too. Thinking about it, i dont remember hearing their engine or anything, just our car and our tires on the gravel. The vibe was kinda off too, not in a bad way just like really strong. Me and my mom both still remember this and both think we saw some sort of time slip.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>So i just commented this and remembered it. Ill add some more details to make it easier to help debunk. Now I'm thinking about it and every single time i do, i can't come up with anything logical. Throw some debunks at me and my mom? We were driving down our driveway (rural southern AZ) and its like a long dirt road and it just goes to our house and dead ends. (Year 2014). There was only room for our car really, the sides were lined with barbed wire fences. We were coming back from the store at like 5 pm and the sun was kinda going down but still bright. We saw a small toyota type car coming towards us and we were like wtf because nobody we knew had a car like that and they were coming from our house. My dad was home and didn't notice anyone and there's nowhere to turn around unless you go around the loop in the front yard. Like im %100 sure my dad would have noticed these dudes going around the loop in looking like this. As the small toyota passed, my mom scooted the car over as much as possible and they went by, i watched them drive down the dirt road. Im aware of how dumb this sounds but as they went by, they were nodding their head and one of them made a peace sign to us. He held it up the whole way and still held it up after they passed because i saw the shadow of his hand through the back window. Think like cheech and chong looking but very real and not a movie and kinda scary. It was so cliche and that's part of why i we were like wtf? We were literally so confused. It was a scene straight out of the 70s. We thought we saw actual people dressed up or cosplaying. The car, their clothes, the driver had like a bandana tying his curly shoulder length hair up and his shirt was green and collared with orange ornate twirls on it. He had sepia tinted sunglasses with golden rims. Then the other guy was wearing a blue collared type shirt like the other guy with the top button undone and he had some sort of bracelet on. He was the one doing the peace sign. The driver was nodding his head more. The car was weathered but not super weathered, it was like a silver toyota. (i think it was the 70s celica model bc i just looked it up and it was 2 door. The layer of paint on the hood was chipping and the windows didnt seem tinted at all.) Now, the house we lived in was just a trailer and im sure it wasnt there for more than 35 years, so i have no idea if this was some weird ghosts saying hi to us or if we just saw some literal hippies in the desert leaving our house. They felt intelligent as they moved their car over too. We only saw them that one time. During the experience we didnt even say anything until after. Thinking about it, i dont remember hearing their engine or anything, just our car and our tires on the gravel. Also i didnt really notice them coming towards us until they were like 10 ft ahead? The vibe was kinda off too, not in a bad way just like really strong and like we should just be silent and watch. Me and my mom both still remember this and both think we saw some sort of time slip since we cant rationalize this.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Unfortunately im kinda in the same boat and its been over 2 years. I dont reslly know if my bf has been looking but i dont think he has, i still have HUGE paranoia around it and constantly have to repress saying anything. He's the type to get defensive even if he is innocent so it makes it hard to talk about anything at all without anger. I feel like i dont know what's gonna hurt more, the repressing of my emotion or the way he is gonna invalidate me if i try to talk about it. I used to be able to talk to my therapist but i lost my insurance so im in the dark now.</TEXT>

Now i figured out that if there was a system update for my ps4 then the automatic renewal would come back on and charge me for the month. I usually only got 1 month or 3 months cuz i play too sporadically and i ended up wasting a lot of money because playstation wouldn't address this issue or fix it.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Not gonna lie i was one of them, but i went camping for a week without my phone and it broke the cycle. I would watch all my subscriptions to youtube, scroll all the way through instagram/Twitter and also facebook. I was never doing something off my phone. After that though i just felt no need to go on it and i realized how much time i wasted. I still have some days where I'm on reddit a lot but that is way better than the alternative since i feel like it's my only outlet. I prefer to rather just sit and think and resist the urge to go do those things as much because it honestly isnt helping me any besides distracting me and that doesn't work long term. Now im struggling with my bf not understanding his addiction. He will literally be driving and be scrolling through Facebook and then say he isn't addicted or find any way to justify that. Its insane. Like everyone is so deep in denial, i wasnt even denial when i was on my phone so much. I knew it wasnt good, i just didnt know how to stop the urge. Well i guess literally cutting yourself off cold turkey can help some people cuz it helped me.</TEXT>

For males it causes early age erectile dysfunction and cause so much stress in your relationships. As a female it gives you unrealistic ideals about how sex should really be. Plus young teens have access to this just as easy as anyone else and their minds are still developing so much that they will be brainwashed by these things and by their peers because its "cool" and "healthy."</TEXT>

The critical thinkers come in and it gets really hard to rationalize with other critical thinkers because we all have kinda good points, or at least points that do make sense both ways. It's so hard to distinguish the truth if we keep arguing what he is or isn't.

    <TEXT>Weed really helped me access my emotions which I had been repressing. It brought a lot out in me that showed me what to work on and a lot of revelation that really changed my core beliefs. A lot of people see weed as a lazy people's drug, or just a way to get "high" and avoid life. But in reality what I needed was the ability to feel more and process the traumas that were brought to light. Weed was definitely a gateway for me to interest of stronger psychedelics and i have tripped on shrooms 2 times. The first time, the shrooms were moldy and i didnt have a lot, despite that i would say i had a good trip. It wasnt strong, but i felt a lot of energy coursing through me. Things got a lot more colorful and they seemed to breathe ever so slightly and i felt a sense of calm urgency to think about my place in the world. I kinda had a lot of thoughts about helping people and i would like to help people have an easier journey through this life. Even if that means helping a stranger on the street, it made their life easier for one moment when we relentlessly get bombarded with too much frankly. I just want to help people and animals have an easier time. I also realized that i didn't want to give all that energy to people who were using me for it. There are many other people that need compassion and i dont wanna waste it on the same person if they are not giving it to another as well, only taking. The second time on shrooms was a small dose as well but i believe they were way more powerful because i had a tiny cap and had about 75% of the same effects, minus the pulsing of the room and objects. It really did improve my mood and my mental function. I feel like psychedelics should be respected. They shouldn't be used with the intent to "find a message" but rather the journey itself is the message. Sometimes there are things we wouldn't be able to process just because it's not of our realm and our brains are not on that level even with influence. Also i feel like they shouldn't be used as much as weed, since i personally consider weed more of a drug that is so individual to figuring out its purpose for you. Someone i know once binged acid, like he did 90 tabs in 3 hours and was tripping for over a week. After that he stopped but i have noticed his life go down a darker road and sadly i do judge him a bit for this because i warned him that acid is not good at amounts like that. It causes physical changes in your brain matter and can possibly wire things you don't want to wire.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Yes but i didnt realize til my therapist told me. I would eat a huge amount one day then eat nothing the next day or two to "make up" for it. This kinda goes into BED territory, minor TW. After the starving of course it would start a cycle beacuse then i would be really really hungry and binge again. I never felt guilty for the binge until i starved myself after. Like i was punishing myself for enjoying the binge and justifying it with the notion above. Nowadays, im kinda out of that cycle and i will eat every day but tbh sometimes i eat way too much or way too little. My appetite fluctuates SO MUCH with my mood that i just let it happen i guess. When im really manic or really depressed i wont feel hungry at all and forget to eat sometimes. Actually forget, like i will remember and then think "omg! I intended to eat and never did!"</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I have so many symptoms of diabetes but my doctor did blood tests on me and my cholesterol and blood sugar were completely normal despite so many problems i have. Overweight, occasional toe/foot numbness, bad circulation, tired all the time, extreme thirst even if im drinking and peeing a lot too, i randomly pass out at times, dry skin despite exfoliation and lotion, and honestly more symptoms on the side of low blood sugar, especially confusion. Idk at this point im thinking i have some problem with blood sugar because i wouldnt pass out for no reason right? After i had been eating and drinking. I would know that if i didnt eat then thats why i passed out but it happens when i eat normally. For reactive hypoglycemia, do i have to trigger it for my dr to see it or would it show up on the diabetes panel?</TEXT>

Do not say they didn't do it right if they tried. Otherwise they will be scared to do anything at all. Number 2, invalidation. "Stop crying or I'll give you something to cry about" and many other invariations of making you suppress your emotion. You end up bottling everything up and snapping. Number 3, attention in general. It is neglect and in some cases abuse to withhold affection or attention from your child. This is conditional love. It teaches your kid that people will only love them if they are basically a slave to them.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>My mom does both still and im 21. School was hell and none of the teachers never noticed because i was a straight a kid. She goes through constantly berating me for something i didn't do/didn't do right. And then completely ignores me. The only reason i did good in school was because i just wanted praise, positive attention, from anyone. A lot of teachers love to focus on the gifted kids but some of us are just as messed up as the "troublesome" ones tbh. She doesn't care unless she has something judgemental to say to me and i know im going to struggle with this for the next few years.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>If my bf talks about sex it just kinda depends what he says or how he says it, however PDA has and always will drive me crazy. If we are alone no problem. I used to hate couples at school that would make out in the hallway or just be way too intimate. If i ever said something people would defend them like "if you werent single you would do it too, dont be jealous." Well guess what, im not single and i still hate it lol. And i have no idea why. I make lots of sexual jokes but once it gets real i just do not see why people like it. Flirting even is a bit gross to me if its not in the right environment. Like i can hold my bfs hand but even a kiss on the cheek is a lot. I dont even do it in front of my parents, i have no idea how i would get married and kiss in front of everyone. Edit Also i would like to add i just dwell on this sometimes because i genuinely think its a core value of mine to be private with that stuff and i dont have any trauma surrounding sex besides rejection really. The reason i think it happens for me, is i guess since i never got affection as a kid i never developed the understanding of affection, and as a kid i really was guarded and never showed affection. So maybe as a kid i felt that stuff was very private for me because if i showed love/appreciation for anything my parents might use it against me or take it away to hurt me. So things like that became really hidden. I see those things and i get kinda resentful that i dont have the emotional capacity? I mean it sounds like it makes sense but then again i just feel like sexual stuff is really gross unless in the right context for my mind.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>No. The vein you see is just a vein and will clot before you die. The actual artery is much deeper and usually under layers of nerves and tendons which just hurt way too much frankly.

Drugs, too much of a chance of living with damage or just addiction. Electricity, hell no, its an exact science to get that right. There was a guy that survived the electric chair back in the day and he said that it literally felt like his veins were on fire. Car crash, water, rope, no thank you. Too poor to hire a hitman for the surprise. I really don't think there is a way to kill yourself without pain. Not unless you're one of the really lucky ones.</TEXT>

Why would you join a group for food if you're triggered by mushrooms? How do you go to the store?

    <DATE>2020-09-01 22:52:23</DATE>
    <TEXT>EDIT: A LOT OF MISUNDERSTANDING guys this happened 2 years ago, sorry i forgot to add that, we are past everything and he says he loves me and wants me etc, this is purely a me issue and i have to heal from this on my own because nothing he does will help tbh. So the second time but the most traumatizing time finding porn on my boyfriends phone was when i checked his google searches. So there was 2 searches one right after the other. The first one he spelled "latina nudws" then the next one was "latina nudes." So one spelled wrong and one spelled right. To me, this was obviously something he recently looked up. The misspelling indicated he was in a hurry to type it. (He didn't wanna get caught therefore he knew what he was doing was wrong.) Then he had to type it correctly so it was on purpose. I brought it up to him after i found it and he said that "he clicked on it on accident, it was a bookmark he saved from before we got together." Uh? So he had a bookmark saved that was spelled wrong? And he put it in the google search? Twice? DUMB. Obviously he didn't. Why would he click it anyways on "accident." For context, i am fat, white, flabby, and im aware im not the most attractive, so it hit me even harder than it would have. Plus it was nudes on google, so not even a video, and somehow that hurt way more because i had taken nudes for him and they were looking fine to me. He still chose the latinas over me. Now, in porn the latinas have big ass boobs and ass and like skinny everywhere else, same with black girl videos. I do not have those. I never will. Ever. I am not of color. I do not have that body type GENETICALLY. AND I NEVER WILL. If i see a latina girl or black girl in public i always look at her boobs or butt and trigger myself if it's "nice" looking. I hate this so much because i live in a relatively diverse place and i cannot handle this feeling. I dont wanna be envious of girls that did nothing wrong but be born with a better body!</TEXT>

But now the sidewalks are shit, i cant afford to live on land in the pacific northwest because the property value is just too high for my budget. Cars drive way too dangerously, everywhere is private land or fenced off to no avail. There is nowhere to play safely, AND conveniently. As an adult i have the option to drive somewhere or bike, but as a kid i wouldnt wanna frickin walk on the road where cars are supposed to be going 20 mph but they're going 50. So as a parent i would understand not wanting your kid out there but as a kid myself i wouldnt wanna either! As a parent it is your job to ensure proper functioning for your kid lol and if that means spending a couple hours of your day taking your kid somewhere safe nd just letting them play or tellin your teen they can go out but to let you know if they're good, then so be it. I would literally hate to be a kid nowadays.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Omg yes. Just thinking this today. I went on a hike by myself, should've took me 20 minutes and it took over an hour. Something about the sound of the wind high in the evergreens, the contrast of brown, white sun, green. The waterfall in the background cascading so much it resonates deep in your chest. Smells fresh. Perfect temperature. Bliss. Usually i find dr episodes fairly enjoyable vs dp is stressful but i tend to do both on my hikes and find it kinda relaxing. It distracts me from the tiredness in my body so i can keep going and lets my mind be free in a time it is *supposed* to be free. This does have its detriment though because if i play a game that happens to be really atmospheric I'll be there 10 hours on my ass playing that. Or if i get a nice break at work i will end up on 45 minute lunches on accident because i was looking at the dew reflect on the grass in the parking lot.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Different types of sugar has nothing to do with this. We are talking fake sugar and huge amounts of cane sugar. Things like stevia or whatever the hell are just completely different chemical compounds, they taste more bitter and don't hit the same taste receptors as the sugar we use. Ever drink a diet soda and think ew? Its the bitter taste from the aspartame. Sugar doesnt have this taste. Most americans at least that i know hate artificial or natural sweeteners that arent processed sugar. People honestly think brown sugar is better like brown rice. Lmao. An example for you: People have cultivated poppy seeds in the past and made opium. The reason everyone got addicted in the beginning? The opium wars and the chinese dynasty of the time wanting to make more money off opium tea. Now what is opium used for? Heroin. What's one of the worst prevalent drugs in America? Heroin. You know how heroin makes America money? Hospital bills, prison sentences, and selling it to their own people.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I was struggling with one of the exceptions. My bf was badly addicted to porn. It ruined everything for us. Details spared because it's truly traumatizing. I was always invalidated because people would say that it wasn't my business, i was being a controlling bitch by asking him to cut down on the porn use. He couldn't get it up or cum for me but he would do it to porn no problem, often in front of me and hide it and lie from me too. We barely ever had good sex for 1 and a half years. It didn't even stem from control or insecurity. I started the relationship and realized his addiction and it didn't bother me until i realized it was seriously reducing his general affection/attention span to me, let alone sexual attention too. I really wish people were more open to the fact that yes excessive masturbation ruins your relationships and especially if porn is involved with it. Be more open to women (and men) if they say there's an issue with it. It isn't always insecurity.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Yeah. Really. Not only because of mental health but my general values about capitalism and how people are treated in america at least. I don't wanna become a slave to the system more than i already have to be, but there is no other way to "survive successfully." I would love to work side jobs or whatever my whole life but that's unfeasible. I am so stuck. I'm 21 still at my parents house and i cant do anything by myself, i cant drive or work or do anything yet and i fucking hate myself for this for not just being able to pull myself out of it. I held a job for 5 months but i felt literally no pleasure from it or nothing really, just so neutral i didnt care.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I struggle with quiet borderline, my mom is much like you describe your mom and sister. Instead of being explosive and mean to others, i take it out on myself, which just leads to destruction obviously. This was toxic for myself and for others too. I saw how much it hurt my friends so i wanted to change and i understood my issue, hurting myself can hurt others. Also it made it very hard for anyone to realize what my issue was, since i wasnt like "most" borderline people. I know my mom can be so horrible. And that's the last thing i wanted to be so i got help. It is seriously a lifelong thing though, BPD cannot be cured but through lots of therapy and self work you can end the cycle and become recovered. And you can always slip into remission too. This is a very scary disorder for everyone involved. However i will say, from experience, people like your mom and sister will never change because they can't acknowledge they have a problem. Honestly its best to cut them out however you can no matter how they feel, its best for all of you.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>My mom let me grab whatever i want from the cabinet, so as a literal child of course im gonna grab candy and bad foods. So i got fat by the time i was age 8. I also have other trauma but not around food at all, so i guess that just gave me control issues and controlling what i eat was something i did for "fun" kinda? This was when i turned 14, i also never ate breakfast or lunch at school to avoid the cafeteria and people would see a fat person there and think "ew she doesnt need to eat." At least that's how i felt. Then at 17 it really evolved into cycles of binging and restricting, i would eat really a lot for a week then i would restrict as long as i could.</TEXT>

Since i had been gaslit my whole life, my sense of self and knowing the truth was never developed. This is something you can lose as well through trauma, betrayal trauma whether it was porn or full cheating can acheive that. If someone is gaslit enough, you never know what to trust, your internal voice is useless because the people around you have always told you it was wrong.</TEXT>

The caption said if you treat people like animals and put in them in cages they're gonna act like animals. Yeah its true. If you put a bunch of criminals with a bunch of other criminals and no healthy outlets at all, then nobody is gonna get better. Adding therapy and rehab gives them an idea of what's normal and functioning, they need some stability to get anywhere. A lot of people are in jail just because they poor impulse control and no moral compass bc of constantly surrounding themselves with the same type of person as themselves. People were saying that a rapist doesnt deserve therapy and rehab. Okay yeah i get it, but when that rapist gets out of jail and rapes again because he didnt "deserve" therapy, now what?</TEXT>

    <TEXT>If they do think that that is who they are though, it causes a problem kinda. If you get stuck thinking you *are* your diagnosis, or that it is an inherent part of you, it makes the hopelessness so much worse. Before i really knew what was going on with me, i thought that my problems were just who i was, it made me feel like i could never change them. If you seperate who you believe you are from what you know is just from your disorder, then it becomes easier A. To figure out who you *really* truly are and B. To focus on helping yourself cope with the disordered parts of your life/emotions. So im wondering if these people are really stable or just repressing it so much that they have issues in other ways? Just a speculation, not a fact tho. Because when i considered myself just having depression and getting a mild recurrent depression diagnosis from my doctor, i considered myself "stable" and i guess i was. But i had other problems lol i didnt realize were red flags. Then it was too late and i went into inpatient and got bpd and pmdd diagnosis. I guess the point of this is to say, online people can say a lot and even in real life say that stuff but they actually just aren't self aware/emotionally awake or educated enough honestly to see for themselves what their problems are.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Similar here. I was 8 like in 2007 and i got put on the replacement hormones for thyroid since my levels were so low. Everyone was like "you'll have to take these forever" but after 3 years i secretly stopped because they made me feel funny. Every time i got tested my level was normal lol. Despite me not taking them. Recently i told my new doctor that and he said its so rare to even hear someone get diagnosed and put on the levothyroxine and then my levels are now lower end but normal without it. Sadly i experience lots of the symptoms of it still, like the bottom of my feet are yellow and im constantly freezing cold even if the room is 80 #176;. And im chubby so it makes no sense why im cold even after walking/excercises.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I've said this before, but i just believe there's a huge difference in tone between wanting to help someone lose weight and just completely shaming/assuming they aren't already working on it. Yes a lot of people will make excuses but some don't and it's safe enough to give them benefit of the doubt. (Also the word "fat" is not bad, society made us think of it as bad bc of the connotation. I can call myself fat and not hate myself.) Saying "hey sarah, maybe you should try one slice of pizza and some salad instead of 3 pizza slices itself" is so much different than, "hey sarah, maybe you should go to the gym and try to eat less" Like yes those statements are both "helpful" but one comes across much nicer and tone matters a lot. You can say the same thing with a different tone and it sounds like you're shaming them (even if you aren't.) And basically it does come down to if that person even asked. Like for example with smoking, hypothetically you can stop cold turkey. But you can't (healthily) lose weight within a week or even a month if you're overweight let alone obese. It's a lot more focus and work and some people aren't ready. For example if i posted a selfie with nothing about my weight and some random follower came in or simply an acquaintance said i should try the gym, i would be offended. Because i didnt ask lol. Most fat people know they're fat already, hearing everyone tell you to excercise and eat healthy is just redundant. You look at your body every day. You're probably aware of what you need to do to fix it. Being fat myself and getting over the excuses were the first part but shaming people is only letting them validate their own excuses and can also make it worse imo, i eat out of boredom and stress, so if i get shamed then im just likely to eat more and it'll be a cycle of guilt. This is a slightly taboo topic but honestly i believe a lot of overweight people (like 80%) are probably overweight because of mental stress or just issues all around. You cannot shame someone out of a coping mechanism without giving them another healthy one that feels just as good. Understanding that a lot of people use food as a coping mechanism for deep seated emotional problems is a part of having empathy for yourself if you are overweight or others who are too. Offering small suggestions *how* someone can eat less or do activites is much more effective than just telling them to do it. Yes telling them to go to the gym is okay but actually even offering them tips or tricks, telling them good gyms, or even offering to go *with* them is the best way to get the thought started. If you don't suggest things at first, then just telling them to do it will have less effect.</TEXT>

Like they were late bc she was upset that he only had one day off and they were going to the dinner. I get it, it sucks not getting any private time with your partner.

    <TEXT>I was diagnosed with hypothyroidism when i was like 10. At 15 i stopped taking the pills for it bc they made me feel funny and i didnt tell anyone and my thyroid levels were always normal. Now at 21 the doctor told me my levels are lower end but normal regardless. I looked up a lot of info on hypothyroidism reversal and there wasn't very much besides the scientific articles. I got diagnosed with pmdd at 19. I was on BC and it made me feel really messed up and i got acute pancreatitis which started the search to figure out the issue, i had a 4 day hospital stay with lots of pain meds for that one. I'm pretty sure something hormonal in my body is messed up and its causing lots of other problems for me. I might have a bit of chronic fatigue at this point because i can barely stay awake 8 hours a day let alone if im doing something strenuous. But no signs of any abnormalities on the tests. It sucks because i have to go to so many different doctors for this.</TEXT>

He is trying very hard sometimes but other times he is too tired. I get it. He did something really messed up and i find it so hard to forgive him, like a permanent split Its been 3 years and im still unable to show that love inside me that i did in the beginning. I would do so many nice things and thoughtful things with him and for him but i feel like he ruined it. Yes that is sad and bad and like i need to get over it. At this point i accept that i feel this way but i hate that i really feel like he ruined my ability to show him full care because of that betrayal. Now i understand why his exes were crazy, they probably all had bpd like me and he triggered the hell out of them. I was the only one willing to try to teach him.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Crying is just an overload of emotion in general. I have no idea if there is like a manual fix to it but it would be cool to see if there are eyedrops or something that slow down the production of crying tears and not normal moisture lol. I always cry and i feel the exact same about people thinking im manipulating them. I cry when my boyfriend says no to me sometimes just because i feel rejected, not because i want him to end up saying yes. I also cry when standing up for myself because i feel like the other person is just better at justifying things no matter who it is and it frustrates me. But my number one source of tears is frustration itself. Like if i knock over a bunch of stuff i just stare and the tears come. I just cry and pick it all back up and it feels crappy lol.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I'll be honest. I feel the same. I told my therpist this. She told me it's okay to feel that way, but try to turn your judgement the other way gently. After all, your emotions are valid, but do not validate them. That sounds really confusing and just not intuitive, but being gentle with yourself and others helps to lessen that judgement. Like in high school someone stole my friend's pencil and she was truly like affected by it. I thought it was ridiculous to be so upset by a new pencil. She had a really good life it seems, her mom and dad were very nice and she had a lot she needed and wanted, so im not sure why she was so upset about it. I just figured she was scared to ask me for another maybe but i still thought it was dumb. Looking back i would have comforted her instead of telling her it was just a pencil.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I know how horrific this is. Im sparing a *lot* of details because she is young. I need help. I'm including the worst parts. BIG EDIT: IM SORRY for not adding this but she is catfishing these men and telling them she is older. When she was 12 we caught her talking to a 17 year old but he looked way older. She is lying about being 18, and also they are lying about being younger. My sister started this addiction when she was about 10. She would first steal movies or watch tapes we had that were vulgar/sexual and watch them. She would also replicate that behavior with stuffed animals. Once i caught her kissing our 9 year old cousin. She's stolen toothbrushes, hairbrushes, other similar shaped objects. Last year she stole my vibrator out of my drawer and my boyfriend lived with us at the time and it made us move out together. My mom disclosed that she stole hers before. She has been having phone "conversations" with different men on video and on video games. She recieves money in random amounts for "winning" games or other weird reasons honestly. She's been having conversations since she was about 10 as well and she would have them loud enough to hear. I'm traumatized from this. My mom is aware of her actions. My sister will never admit to it. She knows it is wrong too. I shared with my therapist and there wasn't much she could do except offer some advice about keeping my door locked and keep my stuff hidden. But i figure someone here has practical advice about how to help either myself or my mom or her understand this is not good. She is being groomed, she is selling her body underage, i cant ruin her life but at some point it has to stop, if she gets old enough to run off with one of these men it could be the end. She has problems and doesn't take therapy seriously. She isolates 24/7 besides to get food and go to the bathroom. She rarely showers. Ive had enough after last night. I really needed my back massager because i have pain and can't relax until it's feeling okay. I couldnt find it so i ask my mom where it is and she cant find it. She says my sister probably has it. I said i dont want back then. And she acts like I'm overreacting!!</TEXT>

    <DATE>2020-09-18 01:54:02</DATE>
    <TEXT>Sick of my mom using fear as a control method against my dad. She uses it for everyone. Fear is not respect. You do not gain respect by making your child/spouse fear you. How can so many people really believe that fear is respect? If a kid is willing to do something for you, usually that means you treated them right. If you have to force them into it, or make them "respect" you, that's the biggest sign right there. If a kid is scared of you, it only works for so long. Eventually they can't feel as threatened by you. And they'll fight back given the chance. If you use fear to make your spouse stay with you, you're horrible. My mom tells my dad all the time that he couldn't live without her. Despite him being the sole provider of the family for years previous. And he believes her just because she's put him down for the past 30 years. He fears he so much it makes him miserable. I have to encourage him to take time for himself. We all fear her because of her constant complaints. As much as she demands respect, she doesn't get it because fear is not respect!</TEXT>

Get one pan and maybe pick up one of the premade frozen meals that you heat up stovetop. You just open the bag and pour it in. Some of them are actually pretty good and some are even more healthy/organic options that you can add veggies or chicken to. Plus with only one pan and one plate dirty, ita easier to clean than using multiple pots lol.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Yeah. A lot of people don't count emotional abuse/neglect as serious but it causes just as much harm as any other abuse. Arguably worse since it's so much harder to identify than physical/sexual abuse and people struggle with it late into adulthood. They also put you through layers of therapy and they'll peel you like an onion to help you cope slowly instead of retraumatizing you. Hopefully at least, if they don't know what they're doing it can be bad.</TEXT>

I usually do about 50-100 milligrams. Most places ive seen sell them in 10 mg doses per gummy and most of them come relatively cheap with tinctures as well. I would go online and search places near you that sell it and ask them if they have edibles and tinctures too, and ask them what they have.

    <TEXT>YES. I have tried my skills and assertive skills and being on topic, etc. I've tried friends, family, my bf. Even strangers. I just feel like I'm too meek regardless of how i pretend to act or project or something. I cant get any replies to me directly, its like everyone is too worried what they're going to say next instead of listening to me. This especially makes it hard to set boundaries since i have to repeat myself multiple times cuz people think im not serious or they're able to get away with it.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I always go hiking in 3 different places. The ones out of the town pretty far are always normal. The one 10 miles out of town had this feeling a couple times. It's near a huge waterfall. I go during the week days, there's never anyone there. One time my bf and i went and we heard voices come from nowhere. We reached a part of the trail that breaks into a little opening, then a female voice said "dont go that way." We both stopped and looked at each other. I said whos there and no one answered. So we stepped another step and we heard a male voice "i told you not to go that way." Yeah we turned and left. We went back a few weeks later and it was normal. But every so often i get that weird feeling like we did before that happened. It just feels heavy, not humid or anything, just heavy.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Yeah, at this point i think i have a phsyical problem making it so I'm unable to wake up. I will lie awake for like an hour before i get up, but i just cannot move or open my eyes. The countless times ive been yelled at for not getting up, or even falling asleep on the toilet after waking up already, is enough to drive me crazy. It's more than an emotional/mental thing for me, i feel like my brain is literally not functioning when i wake up. I am also very confused and disoriented when i become aware, before i open my eyes.</TEXT>

Put one around the end and put a rubber band over it. Blow thru the tube and see how much resistance you have. You should have a little but enough to blow all the air. Make sure you blow the smoke thru the tube and dont just let it float out. The weed smell isn't as strong and ur room smells like dryer sheets now!</TEXT>

Last year was one of the most stressful years emotionally of my life and a couple weeks after it settled down, i got pancreatitis so bad i had to stay 4 days in the hospital, fasting with pain meds. My lipase was 9000+ and my artery could have been damaged and i could have bled out. Ever since i have had gastro issues and stress exacerbates it. If i get so stressed out that my body literally tries to kill itself, am i exaggerating anymore?</TEXT>

    <TEXT>It's way harder find, but it is prevalent. Hundreds of accounts come up for recommended follow if you follow a couple of them and it isn't hard to do if you find just one. Cuz they'll be following other sh insta pages and it's a huge rabbit hole. Some have up to 4k followers and in the bio they state anti recovery accnts and stuff. Some people post pics of the sh and they get removed even with no reports cuz insta recognizes the shapes. So they create ways to hide it from the algorithms and private their accts so they stay up and popular. I followed them on my side insta and there is more popping up every day. A lot of them romanticize sh and mental illness in general. A lot of them tag their pics with # sfx and call it makeup but it obviously isn't. Most of those get deleted because of the tag tho. A lot of them dont seem to edit the pics like twitter which i guess is better in a sick way but the ability Instagram gives to just follow endless sh accts once you find a single one is not good. It just ends in a rabbit hole. At least on twitter you have to search more actively or go the the tab. On insta, the recommended follows show up on ur timeline or a lot when u click someones page and they aren't always related directly to that page. So u get sh acct advertised under a cat meme acct. So u just trigger urself even if u arent thinking abt it especially if you're vulnerable at the time u see it.</TEXT>

And it's not easy and in my own opinion, i don't think anyone should be obligated to change their mindset because everything *is* really shitty for most of us. Just because it isn't shitty, that we live in a "nice" country with food and hot water and bathrooms and jobs etc, doesn't stop emotional turmoil. It means nothing.

    <TEXT>I was a "late bloomer" and didnt watch porn or let alone masturbate until i was like 16. I guess my perspective was that i used it as a entertainment method. Sometimes i would just watch for curiosity purposes. I feel like i had a more normal relationship to it because i separated it from real life so much. I wouldnt call myself addicted or even reliant because i did use it, but i didnt need it. Once i was 18 i got into my first serious relationship and learned a lot about my own trauma and then my first d day happened lol so yeah. I got into the relationship just fine with my bf watching it, i liked it. But then i realized it wasn't allowing us to really connect and be intimate and it created even more issues with the lies. Now porn triggers me. I cant watch it or talk about it or barely consume media with softcore in it. The only discussion i can have around it is in this sub lmao, because i feel safe and understood.</TEXT>

But his porn addiction was different for him i guess, he just lied and knew how much pain it caused and chose to do it still, even after being clean for 4 months he relapsed. I just feel like if we are able to dedicate ourselves to a cause for them, and then they can't for us, is it an insult if they refuse to get help?

    <TEXT>I was 19 and got really bad pancreatitis for no reason, the doctors just told me stop eating fatty food but i was on a diet and had been eating chicken only and veggies for months lol. I also had the "infection" thing, they said my lymph nodes in my stomach were kinda swollen. I smoked a lot of weed to deal with the pain. Now i barely got back into checking up on it after having chronic pain since. Before the episode i had super stabbing twisting almost like a popping feeling in my lower left stomach, then the pain from my pancreas started. But the pain in the lower left stomach is what i get all the time still, especially around 2 weeks before my time of the month. (Sucks being female.) Weed does dull my pain, same with dicyclomine, which makes me feel sick so i only take it sparingly. Its supposed to relax ur intestines. It stops the cramping but the one area that has a stabby feeling still will hurt.</TEXT>

    <TITLE>The soundtrack/score to a video game is more impactful than anything else.</TITLE>
    <DATE>2020-10-01 12:44:19</DATE>
    <TEXT>Games like Skyrim, Fallout, Borderlands, even Minecraft, and a lot of racing games are my favorite just because the music is so atmospheric and beautiful or perfectly fitting and dramatic for the moment. Some games just ruin themselves with the music. Honestly i can't even think of any games that ruined themselves because i just played them once and dropped it, and continued playing the games with good soundtracks. If the score is good, has good timing on the atmosphere, it's gonna give you a vibe that the graphics or story alone would never. In real life we don't get magical music overlays but in the game world it makes the immersion  #215;10 stronger. If the score is bad, it can ruin a game. Having a good score alone helps a game immensely, but a bad score can tank the game for me. Gameplay or anything else hardly pulls me back out of having too much shit going on in the music. Or not enough.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>You're the closest to what i would say, except i do wanna add that i believe that gay/lesbian specifically mean men loving men and then women loving women. If you are nonbinary, and gay or lesbian, depending on your birth sex, it is a entire contradiction to your identity. Say you're female at birth, go nonbinary and use they/them, but say you're lesbian, it just basically means using they/them is never gonna happen because lesbian is women loving women and if you're not a woman why label as lesbian? Instead label yourself as sapphic, which means you like women, but you aren't a woman necessarily. However if you're female at birth, go nonbinary, then identify as gay, it's still weird but not as contradictory since you are identifying as a man in a way, but not nonbinary still. Edit: also i think a lot of nonbinary people dont like to explain their reasoning, i have seen lots and even asked some myself as respectfully as possible why they identify as lesbian or gay or don't wanna look how they identify (for example a lesbian "dyke" as she named herself, grew out her beard and said it was because she was lesbian) Stuff like that is what throws me for a loop, since dysphoria is so different idk how they experience it but being a woman and a lesbian but having a beard would make me uncomfy.</TEXT>

    <TITLE>Polygamous vs monogamous relationships and porn use.</TITLE>
    <DATE>2020-10-09 07:53:45</DATE>
    <TEXT>I always wonder about this. Does porn use make people more polygamous? Let me explain. I don't like to judge, but polygamy just seems sketchy to me. I just feel like the relationship isn't as deep since you're splitting your time with several people instead of one. As well, it's just human nature to provide more attention and time to the person you like more. Isn't that unfair to the other person or people? Also, the biggest part including porn, is if the person just feels bored with one person but doesn't wanna call it "cheating." So they conveniently get into a poly relationship to skirt that responsibility. They use the response, "at least i love my partners! I'm letting them be free!" Well true. But if my partner and i agreed on the same thing, is it selfish anymore? I don't have eyes for anyone other than him, so is the problem that they have eyes for everyone even in a relationship? How does love need to be romantic instead of platonic? Sex =/= love. Plus they like to say that monogamous people are more likely to cheat. Well, obviously?! You can't cheat unless you say you're monogamous!!! You can't cheat if your relationship is "open." That's obviously a false statement. Also, my friend from a long time ago was saying she was poly and her boyfriend said that too, but he i think he said it in order just to be with her cuz he was lonely. He agreed to be poly when he wasn't, all she did was use him for emotional and financial support and fucked other dudes and called it "polygamy" and that makes me sick, cuz i had to watch him suffer while she did whatever, but it was accepted cuz she said it was "poly." I've asked poly people why they feel this way and a lot of them just come back with "holier than thou" comments even if i don't start by stating my opinion. Like they can do whatever, but i want no part of that sketchy shit. Edit: i would like to add that also with a monogamous relationship, the sacrifices that you make should be worth it. Ex you dont like the way your partner does something. You should conversate with them and work it out. If its thag big of a deal anyway, break up. Not just find someone else who doesn't do it in order to deal with it. Or if you arent sexually compatible but everything else is fine, break up and just be friends! Dont keep them as your partner and get another partner to fulfull that! Even if they're doing the same thing, it would suck to be in a "relationship" if you're basically only compatible as friends! That is kinda selfish itself since you're in a relationship with them only because of their friendship stuff, not really romantic or anything if you arent sexually compatible, and if there were certain rules, that partner would be trapped too!</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Sometimes its a journey to learn how to not let people have your kindness. That is their journey as well. To experience rejection, hardship, is something that sucks and happens every single day. It gets me down too. But understanding that sometimes the right thing to do is say no, even if it makes you guilty and shameful, it is safer and more healing to do so. Overextending yourself just weakens your force in every way, and if you don't protect it, the leeches will just suck it from you. You don't want that. They use that energy for bad things most of the time. I always know these people when i see them now. And i let them be since i know putting my energy toward them is useless as they are a bottomless pit.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>This is kinda traumatic to me still so bear with me. She brought a kitten to school in a strawberry container. You know those thin plastic 4 #215;4 ones with holes? That. She took me to the bathroom stall and pulled out this kitten out of her backpack wrapped in a jacket and in the container. It was meowing. I was shocked. She said dont tell because her grandma would beat her. So im in like 3rd grade. I have a moral conundrum that an 8 year old shouldnt. Save a kitten and get my friend beat? Or let her take the kitten and let her get beat anyway? I told on her. I couldnt bear to stand that kitten in there even at that age. Now looking back with more understanding, i dont remember if it survived, i really hope it didnt die of dehydration or suffocation. It looked really young, definitely like 4 or 5 weeks, so no milk and that environment? Horrifying.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>You'll feel good at first then it slowly hits you. You've detroyed your relationships if you had any, you no longer are comfortable in public, you don't enjoy anything, depression creeps hard because you have nothing else to worry about except what you're choosing to do. And at that point it isn't a choice anymore. It becomes habit, routine, and you're less likely to even care to change it. You want to give up. Yeah at first it seems so nice, but you start holding yourself by the collar. Things get suffocating and stale. Boring. Overstimulating. All at the same time.</TEXT>

Theres the sympathetic and parasympathetic but i cant remember which it is. This also explains why some poeple get horny and anxious at the same time lol.

Or are they misguided because of the sensitivity? Is it "intuition" or coincidence? We've sat through a lot of group therapy in the past wondering this exact thing, do we act or do we wait? Usually the therapists tell us that we should wait or do our skills like pros/cons, check the facts. But honestly sometimes i feel like you just know when you can trust it and when you can't, its about learning your own limit.</TEXT>

Constantly force me to do things rather than help me do them, building resentment against everything. Didn't teach me social or emotional skills. My therapist said that usually people remember the person that taught them major events, like riding their bike, tying their shoe, cooking something, they remember someone specific that taught them. I don't. I have no idea how i learned what i know. Books? Video games? I barely watched movies. I mostly read books like stephen king and dean koontz, so that's not the best role model. Edit: also i guess she infantilized everything about me except emotional. I was just expected to act like an adult i guess, while being simultaneously treated like a 5 year old.</TEXT>

It was a bad day and i didnt want to go, my mom thought we could walk in and i could get my test. Nope. So its like 90 #176; and horrible traffic,, we've drove 40 minutes to the driving place, we didn't even need to, and she starts saying she's gonna take me to the other one that's 30 more minutes away. I started crying. I literally just wanted to schedule the test on another day. It's not a good idea to drive when i have a migraine anyways cuz my eyes get fuzzy. She went on me about me never getting my license, not being independent, avoiding everything "adult", and not being able to help her when she needs it. I have a feeling that it was more than just that, it was all about her not wanting me to cry. She never likes me to cry because it makes her feel like a "bad mom." She guilt trips me into not crying because it makes her uncomfortable. That was the last time, i had it. I basically screamed at her that she never lets me cry because she doesn't wanna deal with it. And i told her she's done that my whole life. She just got real quiet and drove home all passive aggressive. But i felt good making her shut up.</TEXT>

Its not like i feel like im wasting my calories or anything, i am just literally not hungry unless i get the idea for 1 specific food. It doesnt even have to be a safe food. I go like 18 hours a time without a meal just because i dont have access to another choice. My parents still get mad at me for stuff like that, messing up the kitchen or eating food that was meant for dinner. So i avoid it a lot. Usually i do eat but like the last month i havent been able to eat but one meal a day, and small ones at that. My boyfriend and mom have been noticing but i seriously just cant stomach the food that my mom makes or what sits around the house. It just makes me nauseous. I dont wanna eat if im gonna feel sick and then not have anything else to eat if i throw up.</TEXT>

Just turning 18 and selling ur nudes online immediately just teaches you that your value is when you're naked and its something everyone does for "easy" money. It really takes mental resolve to keep your intrinsic value when you have hundreds possibly thousands of strangers telling you how hot you are, how good your body is, etc, instead of them complimenting your intrinsic value. Its also bad for people that dont understand the consumption of adult media or how sex workers really feel.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Yes, i feel like bpd and pmdd just make me suicidal the whole time. And i get so much stress from managing my emotions that my body gets the punishment physically as well. I have gastro and hypermobile issues now, which i didnt have even 2 years ago. I'm 21 btw. Mostly my pmdd exacerbates the extremity of my mood swings. They dont happen more frequently, its just a lot stronger. Like i will sob and wretch over not being able to get a cheesburger for 4 hours. Then i will be in a manic mood and consume way too much nicotine and caffeine and send myself into a panic attack. Its kinda a cycle tbh. My regular bpd stuff like abandoment issues gets like a million times worse, i get way more anxiety in general. The new one happening to me is my identity issues, before it was general ones but now i feel like pmdd turns it into full dysmorphic disorder. I feel like baymax, the big white marshmallow alien guy. I hate looking in the mirror at that time, i dont recognize myself, i just want to cut off my stomach, thighs, hips, upper arms. It gets so extreme! It was never that extreme! But yeah! My symptoms have been getting worse since i turned 18 and i actually went to the mental hospital because of a pmdd episode, every month for like 2 solid weeks i juggle the thought if i need to go inpatient again, then i get a little more stable and feel dumb like i didnt need it. But at the moments im feeling like that it just feels like i am a danger to myself, just because my stress levels go so high and my emotions get unmanageable with my DBT skills.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Honestly it is okay to take time for yourself. Is there anywhere safe he can be if you end up going to a hospital or something that you feel will help? Or is there anything you can do to even prolong your time here? Since he needs a mom too, you don't want him to feel the same way, the best you can do is try to provide him strength and structure all you can even if you need to get help to do it yourself. Remember, kids are hard. Its even harder when no one understands your mental illness and demonizes you for how you really feel. I do understand your struggle and i say that as long as you have a way to provide him those things, even asking for help, you can choose your own destiny.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>My teacher always made me do proofs, which is the "why" part. I guess some things dont need a why. It just is a rule in math. Like 4 + 4 is 8, because of the property of addition. What is the property of addition? Well, its when two things are added, the sum of the combined numbers is the solution. Its just obvious at this point. Once the problem becomes something like 8x + 7y^2 = 60 or some weird algebra or trig stuff, its just too repetitive to write all the properties. It is good to explain if someone doesnt know why, but sometimes the why is literally just a rule and there isn't technically a why that we can answer. Like why does gravity exist? We dont know, but it does, and we have rules it follows generally, so we just kinda ignore why for the most part lmao. Fundamental.</TEXT>

I reduced my meat consumption a lot but i still eat chicken and pork due to me not knowing how to prepare iron rich meals otherwise but that's a work in progress. What i hate is people dont understand you dont have to stop eating meat completely. Its a process. Even consuming less meat or raising your own animal ethically/buying from a butcher is better than buying from a store. There's always a way to lessen consumption until you can give it up but everyone always cries about it, missing their favorite foods. Most of those foods can be almost replicated too. Yeah it doesnt taste the same and the texture is a bit gross but if im saving at least one innocent animal, i am happy.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>They shut off the server to do work on it. They cant fix the server with it running since it can cause errors, like when your computer restores and you arent supposed to turn it off kinda. Plus without the traffic on the server it makes it easier for them to work on it. It also gives everyone on the app a chance to update to the latest one since it usually kicks you off depending on the app. Glitches and bugs in the code can cause problems and they can always edit it since most apps are hosted over an online server, which means they can access it anywhere, anytime, for any edits they need. So the people get into the code and write in updates and fixes, also with new phones and systems coming out every day, they dont know how those systems will read their app so sometimes they need to add or remove certain code lines so it can function.</TEXT>

Adding a "good boy" to it doesn't chamge it much unless the intention behind your words is to degrade the child, and it isnt. Obviously back in the day, autistic kids were seen like animals, so i can see how that's insensitive back then, but now its not really degrading since we are *fully aware* autistic kids are people lol. If they respond positively from that stimulus, then i dont see the problem. But they shouldnt be hitting the child if they dont respond, that's the only bad thing i read about it.</TEXT>

Put something inside the bucket like peanut butter or cheese, fill it with about 2 inches of water, maybe more if you want the mice to die quick. Make sure there is a way for them to climb on the bridge part. The mice will fall in the bucket and wont be able to get out due to water/slippery/steepness unless they start stacking on each other. Its kinda sad since they drown but you dont have to do it that way, but you have to let them go far away or theyll come right back. Its basically a giant reusable mouse trap.</TEXT>

The Nisqually are a very private tribe and keep much of their lore to themselves but i searched the internet for a forum that contained that information, so take it lightly still, the guy said he got it from a retired chief who had gotten too old and wanted to share some stories since he didn't hate the white people so much as for their tribe to lose their history. The Nisqually River runs off of a glacier from Mount Rainer down to the Puget Sound. So if i was a bigfoot or a tribesperson, i would use the river for easier transport.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Yeah, literally didnt know how to brush my hair or wipe my ass until i was a teenager. I remember being like 7 and my mom taking me for a haircut and she fought with the lady about my hair being matted. The lady wouldn't cut it because it was so knotted and it was like a health hazard or something she said. Even at that age, not understanding really, i agreed with the lady. Why wouldn't mom brush my hair? I tried but my hair was too long and thick for a kid to get efficiently. Then i figured out i had been wiping wrong my whole life. I only wiped the outside of my cheeks, i thought actually touching my ass was something bad, even though i dont think anyone told me that. It just felt shameful so i never did it.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I feel demented writing this. I'm aware how messed up this is and how dumb this is. But i am desperate. I'm only 21 and my period debilitates me. I've been to the doctor several times but they just tell me it's due to stress and mental health. But pmdd doesn't cause the pain i feel. Last year im sure something happened down there to cause pancreatitis. It felt like something popped down there and now I've had gi issues and period issues since. But none of the doctors listened. They even ultrasounded and cat scanned, i didn't pay an extra $4000 for a clear scan for no reason. Something was wrong down there. It hurt more than my pancreas and that's saying something. Honestly i wanna be sterilized so i dont deal with as many hormonal issues anyway. But they will never do it because im 21, not planning to marry, not planning to conceive. My mom had a miscarriage before me so its probably an issue that runs in my family and never got treated, but i am living in hell every month. I really hope it makes me infertile. Number one so i finally get validation for all this pain. And number two, a free way out.</TEXT>

    <DATE>2020-10-16 21:51:49</DATE>
    <TEXT>Feel free to point out any mistakes, this is a open conversation. I might have misconceptions you can bring up. ~ I'm really not sure why people are so obsessed with voting. Like it actually matters. I'll tell you why it doesn't matter. Why it doesn't matter that these people guilt trip me into hell for not voting. Call me a monster and a fascist for not voting. Call me complacent, racist, and lazy for not voting. The reason it doesn't matter, here is a quote right from google: (In other U.S. elections, candidates are elected directly by popular vote. But the president and vice president are not elected directly by citizens. Instead, they're chosen by  #8220;electors #8221; through #160;a process called the Electoral College.) The electoral college controls the vote, i honestly believe that most of them have no obligation to vote according popular demand. I believe some of them have a price and it's not much. Nobody really knows about the electoral college or how voting works in general, at least the people around me. If the popular vote is all on one side, then the people in the electoral college still don't even have to choose the same vote. Also, just like last election, Hillary Clinton won the popular vote but Donald won the electoral. So even if one candidate wins the popular vote, that doesn't stop anything. Most likely they try to manipulate the vote based on population numbers, solely based on locale and state so no one can say it was unfair. The electoral college members are all chosen differently under different rules. You'll have to look up all 500+ to know their background, etc, and trust them enough to vote in the right person. (If there is one.) Don't vote. If they get no votes, then obviously they'll have to come up with something, and it might end up showing us the truth on the matter. For example if no one voted so they just came up with a new thing where no one votes anyway, they just choose whoever. Then we would see that it was never a free choice in the beginning. Hopefully at that point we would finally be awake enough to fight.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>In therapy, they will tell you that basically you can't control these thoughts, so you'll have to try to control your reaction to them. The way you do this is first notice the thought is intrusive, which you've done, so good job. Then, after this, you have to realize that thoughts actually are not controlled consciously. They're truly random. So you could be doing anything, hence, "intrusive" thoughts. Take your thought and mentally box it up. This takes lots of practice and is usually why you want a therapist. There's lots of ways people do this, so just find one that works for you. The general line is that you seperate yourself from that thought. Pretend it didn't happen, or once you have that thought, immediately redirect yourself to a happy one and think about it hard. If you slip up back to the other bad stuff, just try to redirect yourself back without getting upset. If you want youtube videos or more, i recommend googling "dbt thought compartmentalizing" or simply just "mindfulness thought excercises" if you don't feel like getting complicated with it! I struggle with intrusive anger and anxiety and lots of that stuff too, so you aren't alone. This stuff will work, but that doesn't mean it's easy! You have to think about it every day in order to train your brain, just like your body, if you stopped working out for a while you would get less strong.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Welcome sadly. I joined about the same way. I went to therapy after an institution stay and was diagnosed with bpd and i know its from my childhood trauma. So along with those symptoms, they exacerbate  #215;10 with pmdd. Like i am okay 1 week out of the month, as soon as i bleed too. Like it bleeds the crazy away lol. Its so hard to realize that you've got not only one problem from trauma but also a phsyical hormonal problem too. I get psychotic episodes some months. It feels so hopeless because i will be fully rational and try to plan for doctor appointments and stuff during that good week, but then i just fail and completely agoraphobe myself the rest of the month. I dont have a job or anything and covid forced me back with my parents, worsening everything. Lota overwhelm coming each month as well, despite my problems from bpd being overstimulation anyway. Ugh feels so shit! Relate hard to you.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>If it doesnt blatantly happen like this, then it happens in all the small ways too. It sucks. Cuz you finally feel happier, you see progress. And then the fireball hits and it just burns everything. The same kinda happened to me. Last year i had been through 8 months of DBT and finally saw myself getting somewhere, and my boyfriend of 3 years decided in one literal day that he was driving 3000 miles across the country with $400 and the clothes on his back because he wanted to go back. He moved long distance to be with me. Long story short, it was a mistake he realized, it ruined everything for me. He ended up moving back but i lost my insurance, lost my therapy group, individual therapy, and my psychiatrist. Picked up old habits that i had worked months to break. Its not his fault, but leaving me in one day? After living with him and sleeping with him in bed each night, having to wake up and know i cant physically touch him. (Thanks brain for having no object permanence.) It was too much. The life we built in 3 years was nothing i believe he could just leave behind, if he was saying he loved me so. Even after all the trauma this man has caused me, he does say sorry and make change, but it doesnt stop the hurt or even betrayal trauma on top of my other trauma doesnt go away just because i trust him now. Like a lingering scar on my love. That moment the news drops, you just sink. It feels like you were doing it all for nothing. In reality it is for yourself and if these people don't like the change you're having, its a red flag. Most people like to hang around their own type of energies, and if you're working to mature yourself to this level and actually felt more free, then it just shows a problem with their mentality. They'd be just as willing to work for it as you. And also, as hard as it is to accept, sometimes they're just blind. Blind to how much suffering that we can feel, blind to triggers, blind to their own problems. If they're in denial, about you or themselves, it's best to let them go. Maybe the problem is the opposite. Maybe they see that you're wising up, you'll start to see the error not only in your ways but in theirs, and they start the preabandonment process for you.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>It's so sad but with pmdd as well, i always cry over the smallest things. I wasnt able to get a cheeseburger last week and cried, full on sobbed, for 4 hours. Over a cheeseburger. But a couple months ago, my close cousin commited suicide and i only cried for 30 minutes :/ It makes me feel truly demented like have no sense of empathy even though i have a lot. It just gets focused on small things instead of actual catastrophes. I guess somewhere i read that its because we have been through more huge moments and know how to deal with those since that feels like the "norm" for us. Plus having an obvious big problem is more validating for our emotions since it makes sense to be upset. I actually feel more anguish just from building frustrations and tiny things than from true issues in my life. And it kinda starts a cycle of "why the hell do i not care" and stuff like that!</TEXT>

    <TEXT>In order for me to cut down, i started getting cbd bud. I like being high but what i actually crave is the calm i get. Cbd tends to curb my anxiety and lets my body feel good, and i can focus better without being hungry or tired. I save the thc for later or a couple times a week and mainly use cbd. You can even get the ones like cigarettes for convenience. Also, smoking isnt just a mental thing, its a phsyical act of putting something to your lips, inhaling, and letting it out. Your brain associates those things with good. So if youre having a craving, even pretending to smoke might distract you for a bit. Like hold a pen or pencil between your fingers, inhale and exhale just the same, visualize the smoke coming out of your lungs and the burn inside. It works for me for a minute but i have to do it like every hour or so.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Also, i would like to mention this. My therapist thought %100 that my cannabis consumption was causing my mental unrest. Maybe some more anxiety but definitely not the other issues because i knew why those were happening. I started smoking to cope with the issues, i did not develop the issues after smoking. Also, she thought i was falling asleep in group due to being high and i was not, it was just late in the day and i wake up at 4 am. So i felt kinda called out since it i felt like i couldnt say i was falling asleep because i had no proof except that i wrote notes in my worksheets. I feel like weed helps me not do other bad things, ya know? I would rather get high than hurt myself or others. And i feel like it may be a slight dependency just because of that. Also being accused of that and them believing i had to completely stop smoking in order to get more dbt therapy made me reluctant. It felt like they were bribing me. In reality, the way i saw it, stopping weed before getting dbt skills is dumb. Because why take away my major coping mechanism BEFORE introducing another one that can help? It's like taking away a toddlers toy only to throw it into the flames, let them see it burn, then give them a new one. It just does more harm than good.</TEXT>

First it was my mental health, my pancreas, my gi tract, my back, at this point tmj as well. The last time i got glasses the eye dr took the pressure in my left eye 3 times because he was so confused why my eye pressure was elevated in the left and not the right. The left side of my head is where i tend to get migraines and tension headaches all the time. In the hospital, i had one and the blood pressure of that arm was higher than the other arm. So its so bad that it basically messes up my blood flow. I think it puts so much pressure on my head that my eye gets some of it too, because my left eye gets blurry every single migraine i have.

But bad thing after bad thing with only a couple small good things in between make it so hard to keep the positivity and rationality. I can see what my problem is, a way to fix it, and i try. But during the trying process, something out of my control disrupts my ability to focus on progress. Financial, hormonal, just stuff at this point i can't go to therapy to fix. Why does my car keep breaking down? Why is my pain getting worse despite being healthiest I've been ever? I try not to ruminate but i do. Because why!

Just wanting someone to love you but their intentions are never like your own. Your body is not inherently sexual, its the way society perceives it. It just happens. And we dont ask for it. Its really hard to accept that your body is just the way it is. But i hope you can accept yourself and find someone that doesnt care about that stuff. Those types of things is what push people into image issues, even disordered eating. Honestly yes you are lucky but every luck comes with a price, and that's something i wholly acknowledge on your part.

    <TEXT>I don't think it was abuse but maybe neglect since technically he did neglect to think about how this would affect you. But it's not my opinion, it is yours. It is down to you to decide how this made you feel, if it warrants enough emotion for you to realize it as detrimental, then it is, no matter how "trivial" other people see it. I can see how this would lead to hypersexuality, but other things would affect it as well, so my advice to you would be this: Really think if anything else could have happened to you like this, or if there's any other "weird" memories. Often enough, stuff like this happens due to many small things and not just one event like you describe. It could even be things you think didn't affect you, but subconsciously did.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I live in a town that is outside seattle and the tri city area here in Washington state. Just within the last 3 years, SO MANY people have moved into this town. In the summer, its always crowded due to tourism, the traffic fades off when the rain starts in the fall. But it is falling off less and less. There is basically 1 highway, two lanes, between most of the towns out here. Everyone uses it. There are too many people now for the infrastructure of my town. Even the side roads get so clogged. The parking lots for every single store and drive thrus are filled constantly. Forget going out on saturday or sunday, it takes hours to go 10 miles just because of the sheer amount of people. Also, the uptake of homeless people in my town have rose  #215;3. Idk if Covid did it or if they're moving here because it is just less crowded too. Olympia is filled with tent cities just like seattle and they keep spreading further from the city. I feel like i have to live another 30 miles out in order to be in what would be classified rural area again. In just 3 years, this town has gotten overpopulated. The schools went to crap, right after i graduated they put the 9th graders with the high school kids instead of the middle school due to crowding, now the high school is so crowded that my sister has to sit on the floor because the bleachers cant hold 5,000 kids. 4 years ago when i graduated the count was 3,000.</TEXT>

I was cool, collected, even though i was surely dissocated the whole time, at least i was able to make good grades and function with friends. I knew something was wrong but that was the closest to thriving ive been despite my traumas happening entirely throughout that period. Now im just so overwhelmed by everything. Like something opened and now the whole time I've been denying myself feelings is flashing back. Everything is stressful, even good things. I feel so developmentally stunted.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Honestly, our rent for a 4 bedroom trailer is $1400 a month and we got hella lucky. I have no clue how these people are surviving here with warehouse and fast food jobs, since my town literally has nothing else.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Lots of people in the south and homeless people in cities. People on the border. People in other countries. Lots of people go hungry and not necessarily starve. Starvation can look so many different ways, not just like someone from a concetration camp looked. Chronic hunger eats away your heart, your lungs, your brain, it makes problems later in life and not just at the moment. Even people that aren't "starving" get kidney, liver, and heart damage due to mineral deficiencies rather than food deprivation.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Yeah, sometimes my feelings come from something i literally cant identify. My therapist always said its probably being hungry, not enough sleep, or something along those lines. But sometimes it wasn't. And trying to find the "root" of my trigger in order to use the DBT skills was driving me insane because she would tell me there has to be a reason.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Definitely in state. There's always a certain amount of military people but i guess the population consists of older middle class people and retired people, all the young people move out for university and then come back for the warehouse factory jobs as IT, tech, and computer sciences. But even with $30 an hour i have no idea how they afford a 3 bedroom house for $750k.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I have issues driving as well, walking is so dangerous because of the traffic and no sidewalks! Plus the bus line is dangerous now because I'm honestly not good with standing by someone shooting up on the bench... the drugs here are so bad. In seattle they legalized holding 3gs of heroin just to cut down the intakes for it.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>That sounds like heaven to me, no wonder they're moving in. I try to do freelancing stuff sometimes like fixing up game controllers or gameboys then sell them all nice, but a lot of ppl have been doing this now so the prices inflated a bit. I hope capitalism doesn't ruin what y'all have. No hard drugs to ruin a lot of the mentality? Not sure. The farthest south I've been is Kentucky, so midwest is full of it. But there were communities in KY that were good. But they still had their vice with some sort of drug.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>We had 30 kids per class too. We all felt okay with it but we all acknowledge it IS a lot. With 30/1 ratio it makes it impossible for the teachers to get time with each kid. Honestly i was a perfectionist in school and did it all with my own stuff because i was scared to ask the teacher for help because usually they were busy. Most of them would set up afterschool meetings in 30 minute intervals and lots of kids live far from the school and only take the bus so they couldn't ever get time with the teachers. Plus the kids that might have needed more than 30 minutes were out of luck until the next day since so many of the sports kids and extracurricular kids would fill the spots bc they stay late anyway. Even in my smaller school with 100 kids, there was about 15 kids in each class and it was obvious how much more enriching it is.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Yeah, its like you see the structures lose integrity as no one cares to repair them anymore, those old shops you always see move out and its now a vacant, glass littered storefront. The house on the corner that had a fire incident is still here all they did was board up the windows to keep vagrants out. Also the Pacific northwest decays things so fast with mold and moss. The sphagnum will eat a roof away within a couple years and the whole place goes down like a sunken house in the bayou.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Reading this should be able to give you a concept why this is a sign of collapse. Have you not read any studies about how overpopulation causes mental health decline? Or rapid uncontrollable changes in general? And how mentally unwell citizens cannot function or are more easily controlled? Come on. Youre on this sub, be smarter than that. Or are you like 14?</TEXT>

    <TEXT>We're the last temporate area here. On the east side of the mountain, its much more barren like a tundra almost. So everyone comes to the side with trees, making it even more crowded. I think like %70 of washingtons general population is in the west side, and spokane on the east is the only really big city out that way. I know oregon gets more barren to the east but not as much.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>The duplex and triplex here is so common. If you arent paying $2000 a month for a seperate house, you get stuck with random neighbors and paper thin walls because they're all the type that is cheap. The insulation is horrible too and in the summer with no air conditioning it is hell in the apartments and duplexes. Some people have 4 in a 2 bedroom tiny apartment. I cant imagine how they feel. Lots of people live in their vans here. They just kinda live at the natural parks and store parking lots.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Yes me too. I have weird vague fears and i always feel like i wanna know why, but things are just too far away to remember. I fear dark hallways, is that just a dumb fear or did something happen to me? Because i do remember a *slightly* traumatic moment in a dark hallway but does it even have to do with it? Also (cw... mentions of possible sexual abuse!!) . I have some weird stuff surrounding affection and being alone with certain men, and i have no idea why would feel that way so it makes me feel like i have a repressed memory of sexual abuse? My sister acts weird around that stuff too. But no one abused us like that or neither of us talk about it? So why do i feel like that when other survivors of sa talk about it being a bit similar? It scares me!</TEXT>
