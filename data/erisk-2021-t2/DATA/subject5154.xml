    <TEXT>So I just released my first EP about 2 weeks ago (bad timing, I know). Wrote all the songs myself with some edits/suggestions from my producer. I #8217;ve taken a few music courses and read several books on songwriting. Hired some really sick session players for the record and picked this song to share since its got three verses, a bridge and a chorus (which is about as complex as I get). Entire EP is up on iTunes, Spotify, etc Hope you enjoy.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I have a set of Hohner Marine Band Special 20s that I bought about a decade ago. I haven #8217;t actually played on them much, but they #8217;ve certainly been exposed to high heat and humidity (Texas). I #8217;ve started to become a little more serious in playing them and I #8217;m wondering if they are outdated, cheap, possibly warped and curious about what someone might recommend for an upgrade. If it matters I play straight harp in a country/Americana singer/songwriter vibe. Thanks in advance. Tony</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Well, I certainly wouldn #8217;t challenge anything you have to say in the field of climatology because that is your field of study, not mine. I #8217;d appreciate the same respect toward someone in my position in the field of social sciences, because that #8217;s exactly what this topic is about. Yes, my field has some quacks, as I #8217;m sure there are some climatologists that don #8217;t believe in climate change, but this dude isn #8217;t a quack as far as I know (which is just his book). I think we would all be better off, however, accepting that we are not all health care professionals or constitutional lawyers or climatologists or social scientists, and give those professionals the benefit of the doubt. With that said, this dude #8217;s book is well written with some solid arguments. You have read the book, right? If you haven #8217;t just google  #8220;On Killing PDF #8221; and you should be able to find a digital copy floating around. It #8217;s an easy read.

    <TEXT>Maybe I am being dense. Maybe my assumptions about plantations are wrong. I #8217;m sure they employ (not at all ironically) lots of POC. I #8217;m sure they host beautiful weddings (for white people), and I #8217;m sure the tourist population is representative of the general population and not all dominated by middle class white people. Truthfully, I don #8217;t have a problem personally paying to tour a beautiful estate, but I #8217;m sure it #8217;s not a pleasant experience for the vast majority of SC #8217;s AA population, and for that reason I #8217;m out.

    <TEXT>A visit to the doctor without insurance will probably cost you a couple hundred bucks, and the doctor will be able to write you a prescription for anti anxiety medication. Generic Xanax (alprazolam) will run about $80 without insurance but I think there are actually coupons that will bring it down to $30. This price is for 30 pills that you should take as needed when your anxiety is bad but are easily addictive. Because it is an addictive and controlled substance, your doctor will probably not allow you to get refills and you will have to see him/her again to get a refill. I #8217;ve never gotten meds in MX and I #8217;m not sure if they will require a prescription, but that seems like it might be your best option (even if you have to see a Mexican doctor to get a script) Im sorry about your situation, but know that your reason for anxiety is NOT stupid. I have a masters degree in psychology and teach psychology for a living, but I am not a doctor or a clinical psychologist (therapist). I also have my own prescription for alprazolam.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Just had my first CBD experience. I locally purchased two pre-rolled 1 gram spliffs for a total of $24. The vendor basically said it was the best they had. I got a Sativa strain called Maui Haze and an Indica strain called Stormy Daniels. Vendor told me there were each about 25% CBD. I just smoked the entire Sativa strain over 2 sessions while I played guitar (I #8217;m a songwriter that plays about 4 hours a day). It felt pretty good, dare I say great. Still does. I smoked marijuana daily for about 10 years and that #8217;s not an option for me right now for many reasons, but anyway, it certainly was nostalgic, but I absolutely also felt a physiological and psychological effect. Not completely unlike marijuana, just much more mild and pleasant in that I didn #8217;t feel like my cognitive functioning or coordination was impaired, if anything it was enhanced. My creativity was certainly enhanced, my short term memory may have been slightly impaired. I feel like my awareness of time passing was also slightly affected. Again, not completely unlike marijuana. Anyway, I #8217;ll probably try the Sativa strain tonight. My questions are: 1.) What kind of value did I get? 2.) Is anyone familiar with these strains, and could you share your experience? 3.) Do you have any recommendations for other brands, strains, products or vendors?</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Oh man. Just boil the tomatillos and jalape #241;os together for about 12 minutes or throw them under the broiler on a sheet pan to get them charred up. You #8217;ll want to keep an eye on them and turn them once they get some black on them. Either way you will get a more balanced salsa with deeper flavor. Raw tomatillos can be a bit too acidic and sour. Leave that to the lime juice.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>You definitely used the right word in  #8220;imprinting #8221;. When we discuss attachment in psychology it is usually prefaced with Konrad Lorenz #8217;s work in imprinting, but we quickly jump to the concept of attachment. Usually starting with Harry Harlows study with baby monkeys (one of my favorite studies). Ultimately this all debatable, but I think my position is that birds imprint on a strictly biological basis, and mammals form attachments that involve both biological and socioemotional processes. Please look up Harlows study! There are some great videos on YouTube using research footage. Edit:grammar</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I was just down there looking at properties. Didn #8217;t see much in the way of a  #8220;steal #8221;. Condos we saw were going for 175K. SOKO is a new development still under construction with presale units going for 150K-200K. Not sure how these prices compare to what is  #8220;normal #8221;, but my OP had broken link, so here is is if you are interested in seeing the location www.sokotulum.com</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Our intention is to use it as both. My understanding is that part of the purchase includes rental management for the first two years so we will be renting it out heavily on the front end. I #8217;d be surprised if we spent more than 2-3 months out of the year there As for the price per square foot, I don #8217;t know. My wife is handing the details. It seems on par with most of the Aldea Zama stuff.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I don #8217;t mind a shoebox. There are some nice shoeboxes out there. You look at any major city in the US....shoeboxes half as nice going for twice the price. As for the ROI I #8217;m not really sure how common for those numbers to be put in writing. Maybe it #8217;s common, maybe it #8217;s included here, I just don #8217;t know. As for paying taxes, I #8217;m fine with that too. I #8217;m no colonizer, and furthermore my wife holds Mexican citizenship. We are just very Americanized and from a business perspective we might as well be outsiders.</TEXT>
