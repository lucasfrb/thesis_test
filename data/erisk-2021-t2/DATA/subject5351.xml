    <TITLE>Can anyone remember previous exam fees (or membership fees) in  #163;GBP?</TITLE>
    <DATE>2019-07-23 13:09:19</DATE>
    <TEXT>Google is throwing a blank. I am surprised to see an 11% increase from  #163;108 to  #163;120 from 2018-2019 and I wondered what the fees were in the past for an F paper, I can't find previous years P-level exam fees. An 11% annual increase is phenomenal when the quality of service (in my experience within a specific CBE centre) has declined over the same time. I've seen candidates computers crash, answers inputted then lost when moving on to the next question and half asleep invigilators completely unaware of their surroundings. Are these price increases inline with other bodies? What is the purpose of them - a cynical cash grab? I can't see how their costs have increased by the same amount 11%!!! Crazy. I guess the top brass at ACCA are rolling in it.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>"Arefin Raisa Khan, of Bangladesh, has the dubious honour of being the last part-qualified to be removed from the ACCA student register in 2019. Her sin? After becoming a student she failed F9 in June 2016, F7 in December 2017 and F6 in March 2017. She then claimed in January 2019 she had completed a BA degree with Anglia Ruskin University, and requested exemptions from papers F4 to F9. However, looking at the documents ACCA smelt a rat! Or, as ACCA put it, had "a suspicion regarding the authencity of the documents submitted". Anglia Ruskin confirmed the documents had been forged and related to a different student, who graduated in 2013. As well as being removed from the student register Khan was fined  #163;6,600 in costs, reduced from  #163;7,450." \- PQ Magazine The absolute doughnut.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Who here is concerned about the potential for the June exams to be cancelled? I don't want to spread anymore hysteria than is already out there, but in the UK it doesn't look like we have any type of strategy to deal with this illness and I can't see it being sorted in the next few weeks. Since the March exams I've finished APM lectures and am a third of the way through SBR lectures, maintaining decent progress, though the thought of countries going into lock-down puts a dent in motivation, especially when people had issues with March exams. I'm now sitting here for the first time thinking I can't be bothered!</TEXT>

    <TEXT>You absolutely should care about people cheating. It brings the qualification into disrepute. Those same cheaters could beat you to the same job. Why should a cheater get something so difficult with ease when we all work so hard for it. It is ridiculous to suggest you shouldn't care about cheaters, if we accept cheaters your qualification along with your time won't be worth the paper it's written on. With regards to the CPA comment I totally agree, but it's not delayed for something trivial such as an administrative error, people are losing loved ones to this illness, I think you need to refocus your perspective. Its not ideal but the solution is to get your act together and deal with it. I do sympathise with you as I'm in the exact situation but if you can't handle a bump in the road it's going to be a long tiring career for you.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>SBL is not a labour intensive module, you need to demonstrate a sense of commercial acumen with a practical approach to answering the questions. Much of what they teach you in the books is models to consider, which help frame your answer. It's not that you have to memorise the ins and outs of it all. I did not refer to a single model. You've got the bulk of AAA under your belt, I'd find 5 months of revision overload. I did the two together, 90% of work went towards AAA. If I had my time again I'd do it the same way.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I saw this from acca, in my understanding a cottage industry is a term used for small businesses at home. Ie an example would be if you had a little business making keyrings and selling them on the website etsy. It's a small business that enjoys the benefits of being at home and is never really going to take off into something massive. A fragmented industry is one where there are no single major players to move the industry in a certain direction. I. E., a non fragmented industry could be books, amazon are the market leader, they invented the kindle and started to move the industry towards e-books, a fragmented industry could be something like the food takeaway business, full of many different little players all doing different things but none of them are big enough to force the others into doing the same thing</TEXT>

If you've had a lot of exemptions perhaps they are trying to slow you down so you gain more experience in the job before signing you off. Just ideas dude.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I don't like it myself, I think it undermines the quality of the qualification. That said, I don't know how the measures put in place will work (AI, etc). I mean sure they can take over your screen and maybe include a webcam, but what's stopping you from having notes all over your monitors case? I don't think it's the right move, to me it feels like they are using coronavirus to shoe horn in a cheaper way of conducting exams. If they didn't have to pay the exam centres and invigilators then they would make so much more money.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I am starting to study again from the second week of June. The reason is it will be as if I sat an exam in June, had a week off and then started the next modules, which is what I would usually do. That gives you a solid 10 weeks to study for both AAA and SBL and I'm assuming you've studied the bulk of SBL and was nearly exam ready. The break due to exam cancellations hasn't been ideal but you can't let it deter you. Enjoy another week or two of relaxation and then get back to it.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Of course, I just think acowtancy charge a fortune for what they offer and your payment only provides access to one module for 6 months. The bulk of their course is text accompanied with short videos. I think it's very poor value for money all things considering. Plus I don't like the mans personality, he seems a bit arrogant, so there's that. With regards to learnsignal, it's cheaper, provides access to all modules and has a chatbox where you can ask questions to a tutor. There is the argument that their lectures are a little dry but then this is an accountancy qualification, there's not many ways you can jazz it up. All things considering it is a matter of preference, your best bets would be to try both and see which you prefer!</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I started ACCA late 20's with no real accounting knowledge or experience. The first three modules - AB, MA and FA - really bring you up to speed quickly. I don't think it's worth sitting AAT just to do ACCA immediately after. The caveat to this is that you need to have a certain level of qualification before starting at ACCA AB (F1). If you don't have them then you will have to start at the foundation level, and in this case it maybe worth while to pursue AAT first.

    <TEXT>I typically follow a similar approach for most of the ACCA exams. First I watch the videos on my chosen provider to get an idea of what the course is about. Whilst watching I type my own notes up. When I've finished that, I retype my notes into more of a brief version and I use the textbook to help refine my understanding. Once that's done I then start the exam kit and answer the questions on an "open book" basis, that is, I use the textbook to help me answer if I have tried and cannot do it by memory. Finally read the technical articles on the ACCA website and keep practising questions where possible. I try to sit the mock exams "closed book" i.e., not using the textbook to help. I've never sat a mock exam to time. I just try to go for thorough understanding. The night before the exam I rock myself a corner thinking why am I doing this to myself.</TEXT>

You've been taught ACCA's way, you know what they are looking for. Your mate has to go and check all past modules as it's all assumed knowledge. You're used to intense exams, who knows if your mate is. That said, he may have had to do other things that you haven't, which may balance it. I don't think it's unfair, but it is a bit of an annoyance when ACCAs standard is constant and each university's standard differs.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Good contribution and insight. For me, and this is specifically for UK universities, I can't see why you would go to university to study accounting. It costs something like  #163;30,000 for a degree and you still have the professional papers to sit. I have self studied with ACCA and have nearly finished, it has cost me less than  #163;2-2,500 for the whole lot.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>SBL being attempted towards the end is irrelevant, what matters is whether you can offer a business high quality advice using your business acumen, accounting knowledge and commercial awareness. This is what they are looking for in the exam. If you have failed SBL the likelihood is you are relying too much on the models outlined in the textbook and are not appropriately using the extracts given to you in the exam. I barely used a thing in the textbook and passed with a high mark just by putting ideas down and drawing upon experiences I had in the workplace. You should definitely continue with SBL and should do it alongside SBR.</TEXT>

    <TEXT> gt;So I currently have a full time job (not accountancy related) it is very flexible and I should be able to get time off for exams - so that part is not an issue. But I wondered how many hours per week roughly you would spend to study?- of course I know everyone is different but just wanted an average idea on whether it #8217;s feasible to do with a 37.5hr a week (not demanding) admin job. I'm UK too. If you think of an exam cycle as the 12 weeks between exams then I spend on average 2 hours a day for the first 6 weeks and up that to about 3-4 hours per day for the last 6 weeks. Some students use less time, I'm as thick as rocks so I like to take my time.  #8203;  gt;Second question is about the work experience, I know 36 months is needed, how did you get this? Did you find a job/placement before beginning the qualification? If so what and where do I need to search to find somewhere who will take me before beginning and who will ideally support me through gaining the qualification? Or have you found experience part way into studying, again how did this work? Or even after doing all exams? You can do this however you want but ideally you would like to start getting these months signed off as you proceed through your exams. If you do one exam a quarter and do not fail any then it is going to take you about 3 years to complete. You don't really want to spend another 3 years gaining the experience before you can call yourself chartered. There are two elements to it, the work experience and the PER objectives. Your line manager at your place of work can sign off the hours you have spent on an accounting/finance related role. For the PER, you need to achieve specific objectives which a chartered accountant signs off for you, they are essentially statements you write down to confirm that you have achieved a given objective, google it for more information.  #8203;  gt;Are there any exams I can not do without having work experience? Or is it possible to do them all and then find experience after? You can sit all exams without ever stepping foot in an accounting/finance role, but if you do it this way you don't have the opportunity to learn passively - i.e., things you may need to do in the exams may crop up as a daily task in your workplace.  #8203;  gt;My background is not in accounting, I have the necessary qualifications for joining, but my bachelors is in psychology and MA in criminology, so it #8217;s a big change to what I #8217;ve done previously. Do you know where I can find more specific details of the type of content before enrolling - so I can ensure it is definitely something I am capable of doing. You need to check out [https://www.accaglobal.com/uk/en/student/exam-support-resources.html](https://www.accaglobal.com/uk/en/student/exam-support-resources.html) and click the professional qualification, then each module and look at the syllabus. Be under no illusion, it's only a 50% score requirement to pass each module but the volume they expect you to learn and remember is huge, but as you are used to studying at a high level you should be accustomed to this already.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>First week of cut and have dropped 4.5lbs via a 700cal deficit, 250g carb, 188g protein, 83g fat (usually 3200 cals maintenance). Seems an excessive amount to lose for 5 days in. Was aiming for 2lbs loss a week. Various sites online say you can expect to lose more in the first week, but have read nothing to quantify how much more. Am I on the right path to suggest monitoring it for another week, to rule out loss of water weight or would you guys suggest upping my intake slightly / adjusting the ratio Lose weight for fun, struggle like a bitch putting it on.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>You don't control your data if you have it saved onto the cloud. It's on somebody else's hard drive and you have no physical access to it and you are subject to the restrictions the hosting company place on your account. A large existing infrastructure could be that you have many different offices around the world for your business and the logistics of getting every one connected to your system could be expensive, cloud based is a more cost effective, less capital intensive way of doing it. If you don't want to sacrifice security then there's no chance you'd use cloud based That's my take on it anyway.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Chartered Accountant is a protected term for ICAEW, so we always have to add the 'certified'. ACCA is still chartered, it's just different branding. There maybe a perceived element of prestige with ACA but how much of that boils down to the fact you have to study at an approved employer. I wonder how varied your average ICAEW members experience is outside of accounting if that is all they have done. I'll have to defer to you on your point regarding practice, I've never worked in one.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Yes that is essentially what I said in another comment. The reality is if you are doing a remote sitting you're going to have to do your calculations on the computer's scratch pad. It is inconvenient but at least you are getting an opportunity to sit the exam. To comment a different way - if it is that much of a big deal, why not pause the progress on your exams and wait until you can go back to a CBE centre? When you look at it that way the inconvenience of the scratch pad is not all that bad.</TEXT>

Example (and these aren't my macros, just for simple maths) : Starting weight at 180lbs and you're wanting to cut, you punch your numbers into your macro calculator and it suggests using 1g / lb of protein = 180g of protein a day Do you reduce the protein intake inline with the weight lost on the cut, or do you maintain that 180g throughout?</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I get what you mean. I sat and passed AAA, studied APM but deferring that until December to concentrate on SBR. For AAA it seemed easy, the questions seemed straight forward, during the exam I didn't stop typing, found loads to discuss and point out, thought I had a really good and confident attempt. I passed with a relatively low score. From my experience I can see why it's very easy to fail, I think they want you to go in depth with everything, I must have scored a lot of half marks. Don't underestimate, treat the exam with respect  #128077; #127995;</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Yep, treat them both with the respect they deserve, otherwise you might take it easy and fail. Make sure to finish the practice question book, there is only so many ways they can word the questions, there really should be no surprises when it comes time to sit the exam. Also you will have the benefit of SBR knowledge which I did not have beforehand.</TEXT>

This is a bit of an odd reply, what you are saying in essence is true but this sub relies on people sharing their approach to, and experience of, these exams.

    <TEXT>Folks, I have an rtx 2080 super which when playing games such as the latest tomb raider on ultra settings operates at 70-80 degrees. I'm trying to find out if this is a standard operating temperature for this type of card when playing a game like this. The CPU doesn't tend to go higher than 50-55 degrees, so I think my overall ambient temperature within the case is fine. Would just like to hear if you guys think it's about right as this is my first build and when searching online it is unclear if its running too hot or not. Thanks in advance</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Hi there, thank you for your reply and help, I bought this case: [https://www.scan.co.uk/products/nzxt-h710-black-red-mid-tower-w-tempered-glass-window-3x-120-1x-140mm-fans-usb-31-gen2-type-c-eatx-a](https://www.scan.co.uk/products/nzxt-h710-black-red-mid-tower-w-tempered-glass-window-3x-120-1x-140mm-fans-usb-31-gen2-type-c-eatx-a) It has 3 fans in the front, and one exhaust fan at the back. The gpu is positioned horizontally, the gpu intake fans are beneath it and there is nothing else occupying the motherboard slots underneath, so it essentially gets a good blast of air from 2 of the front fans. I had taken off the front cover of the case to expose the case intake fans and this did make a noticeable difference. I wanted to ask this question before I start exploring a custom fan profile on the bios, because the case fans never seem to ramp up when everything starts warming up</TEXT>

If they scrapped the channels, website, radio stations it wouldn't make any difference to my life though I appreciate that others enjoy it. I resent having to pay for it though. I happily pay for other services that I actually watch, but I am forced to pay for the BBC that I have no interest in watching and until that changes I'll always be in the "defund" camp.</TEXT>

If memory serves the only time limit rule now is that you must complete your P papers within 7 years of passing your first P paper. *edit, to clarify, the ten year rule was regarding time to complete the exams. There is no time limit to complete the three years work experience.

    <TEXT>You should look for roles such as accounts assistant, accounts trainee, accounts clerk, those types of things to get you going. They'll give a decent amount of exposure to the role and you will be able to move up both in time and as you pass qualifications. This of course assumes you have no other relevant qualifications or relevant experience. With regards to how many exams should you pass. Really I would look at crunching the first three ACCA exams over the next 3-6 months, this will give you a solid grounding of the various accounting basics</TEXT>

    <TEXT> gt;Because, I have so far done quite a substantial amount of questions and a lot of them don #8217;t actually require a model and just require that you apply the information from the question to the requirement, bingo. The model is there to help you frame your answer. For what its worth, I didn't reference (or fully use!) a single model. I just applied a bucket load of common sense. The key for all of these exams is the scenario. Look at the detail given to you in the scenario, there are no wasted sentences - each sentence is a clue, something you could talk about, and that should trigger your response.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Absolutely feel the same, it's been a really difficult cycle for me. Typically my pattern goes: * Sit exam A, * over the following six weeks start studying for exam B, * at the six week mark receive exam A score, if pass great, if fail make a study pattern to revise exam A around exam B * over the following six weeks revise for exam B * Repeat the process til all exams passed. I've found this process really helps with my pace, so I hit a point where I hit "peak performance" around the exam time. If I study for a period any longer and I start to forget things I did in the weeks prior, any quicker and I'm unprepared. I started in the second week of June but back then it was very uncertain as to whether or not we would be sitting September exams, this was demotivating. Well with the coronavirus shutdown my pacing has been well off. I'm doing SBR, there are that many rules to follow I just cannot remember them all (I'm going to sit APM too but I am completely unprepared for this, I'm only sitting it because I've paid for it). So I find myself in a similar position to you, momentum seems to be waning, stuff that I knew I now don't and I'm feeling pretty damn anxious if I'm to be honest. I just want this week to be over with. I think our problem is we have had to wait since March. Its tiring and the uncertainty we had as to whether we would sit these exams in September really takes the wind out of your sails. These are my last two exams, so no matter what I'll have to have a six week break between exam time and results day as I won't be able to start another, got to say I feel I need it, I've been at this for close to four years now. We're towards the end of the qualification and they say the last hurdles are the hardest to jump so try not to get stressed over it, try your best, I am sure you are prepared and when the time comes you will be in exam mode and I'm sure you'll pull it out of the bag.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Yes that's what I mean. In my experience I don't think the P paper syllabus is larger than the F paper syllabus in terms of new content, I just wondered how they compared to uni. My reason for asking is I have often thought, or wondered, that those who enjoy nine exemptions are at a way disadvantaged when starting ACCA papers due to how large the syllabus is, and that is reflected in the lower p-paper pass rate vs F papers. I started at AB, so I am used to doing it ACCA's way and I don't think that the step up to P papers has been too significant. Was just curious to see the perspective of a uni grad</TEXT>

If you fail, you haven't lost anything, you just didn't gain it. If you pass, great, your process works! This helps keep me pretty relaxed for the most part</TEXT>

Due to systemic racism which leads to poverty in my household, I have limited internet access and that effectively impedes my learning on the finance world Your limited internet access doesn't stop you from chatting shit on reddit though does it. Look, white people don't sit around the kitchen table talking about derivatives over tea and biscuits, I'd guess most of the country hasn't got an idea what axe is talking about when he goes off on one. If you want to learn finance, pick up a book, if you want to put your feet up and enjoy a show for what its worth then do so, but don't bring your ethnicity into it, its got nothing to do with anything here.</TEXT>

    <TITLE>Statement from ACCA regarding exam disruptions</TITLE>
    <DATE>2020-09-09 17:59:36</DATE>
    <TEXT>We are very sorry for the delays and disruptions experienced by some of our students sitting exams in the past two days. While the majority of students had a smooth experience in very busy exam sessions, we failed to reach our own high standards in some venues. Our initial reports show that issues were caused by problems with power supply at some centres and technology issues at others. We will continue to investigate what went wrong and make changes where we can in order to improve. Where possible, we will continue to offer students who have had exam sittings cancelled the chance to take the examination remotely within the next few days. We will do our best to ensure that students do not lose out professionally as a result of these difficulties and we are happy to refund their examination fees, if we are unable to reschedule the examination.</TEXT>

Couldn't work out what I'd done wrong - I looked high and low trying to find the problem, spent hours upon hours of researching online. Eventually I pulled everything out and put it back in, finishing with the 24 pin, it was a fraction of the way out and that's what was causing me so much bother.

You're expected to write a tonne more, no multiple choice, but the questions are structured in a way they are "easy" to respond to. By that I mean, if you know your stuff, you know what they are getting at. The ESPM is possibly the single most boring thing about ACCA, do try to get it out of the way ASAP. It's exhaustingly boring. I quite enjoyed SBL, I did not prep much for it as I was studying for AAA at the same time, but it gives you an opportunity to put a tonne of business types of ideas down, I enjoyed sitting it tbh.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Do you get an opportunity to explain or represent yourself in the mitigating circumstances option. I wonder if you could say, for example I lost 25 minutes. So that's 25 minutes / 1.8 marks per minute = 13.8 marks I didn't get an opportunity to answer. Then they multiply that 13.8 marks by what you scored over the rest of the exam, say if you think you were running at 40%, and you gain 40% of marks you attempted that's an additional 5.5 marks they should give you. So in this example it'd be a fail, it's largely contingent on how you think you did. Just an idea. I wonder if that's how they handle stuff like that.

    <TEXT>I used to start studying for the next paper the first Monday after exam week. I would study the content until results day and revise from that point on. If I failed my previous one, I'd decide whether to continue revising two, or drop the one I'd recently started. I don't think ACCA will update their locations just yet. I am in the UK and have never really had a problem with availability, and would book on results day.</TEXT>

People are constantly looking for shortcuts and the reality is the course will become a laughing stock. Even on Reddit we police so much bullshit - people asking how they can get away with doing the ethics module, people asking for ways they can cheat on the remote exams etc etc. If you at least tell ACCA how these people are cheating then it's something for them to start taking seriously.</TEXT>

    <TEXT> gt;I may be completely wrong though! Nothing wrong with your opinion dude. To clarify my thoughts I'm not saying aim for 50%, I think you work towards getting a full understanding of the whole syllabus, I just don't think you should kill yourself in the process of doing so. Some people will hammer out an incredible amount of hours on this course so they can show a future employer "look, I got 85%" and that pressure can be detrimental to mental health. You can simply say "I passed" and that sends the same message, they set it to 50% for a reason.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>No, in the future you will be able to re-register as a student. The results for your F papers do not expire, this is only the case for the P papers. With regards to your diploma I think if you log into MyACCA there is an option for you to print it out, I would do that and keep a hard-copy if you have access to a printer. I cannot see ACCA preventing you from accessing this in the future though, they have awarded you the grade. If you have paid for the EPSM it maybe worth completing before your student membership expires, it is expensive and I wouldn't want to have to risk repaying for it in the future, though I don't know what the terms are surrounding this.</TEXT>
