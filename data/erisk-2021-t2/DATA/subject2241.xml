    <TEXT>I was listening to music in my garage one night; which at one point, I used to do quite often. And I started dancing to a favorite song while in trance. About five to ten minutes into what felt like an aerobic workout, the side garage door began to shake like someone/something was trying to rip it off its hinges. I've never witnessed anything like the ferocity I observed then. That rampage lasted for about five seconds. I went into the house to see (through the window) if the outside spotlights had been turned on. Nope. Which indicates that it was either the wind, or it was a poltergeist experience. I get goosebumps now, even thinking about it.</TEXT>

    <TITLE>Cannabis helps me to (1) stay out of the hospital, (2) remain on a good diet and (3) take my medications. Thank you to marijuana for Her service to me! Hail the Devil's Lettuce!</TITLE>

    <TEXT>#TL;DR My name is [Bret](https://twitter.com/devbret_) and cannabis helps me with surviving this crazy train ride in my head; and heart. It's alright to be a stoner with mental illness and/or autism. That's the fierce truth. As a thank you, I offer *[these Drumfunk tracks](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7YA8zEim0A8 amp;list=PL-JUDLM4TH_93cCpb9k2Yd2QhWyFhpQrj amp;index=1)*. And *[these Bollywood music videos](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YETdM2gmQQQ amp;list=PL-JUDLM4TH_8Q4ApFUb5wpPPFdyZRczf0)* as well. #The Full Story I don't know where I'd be if it weren't for cannabis. I #8217;m alive today because of Her. She protects my life with joy. To give some context, I've been hospitalized twice during prolonged periods of time wherein I didn't have access to marijuana's grace and effects. And after sixteen years of smoking, I #8217;ve concluded that She's 100% a tool for mental (as well as overall) health. While under the influence of baseline reality I have much more difficulty in life. Especially as someone who is neurologically divergent or neuro-atypical. Frustrations abound. It #8217;s akin to walking in a thick, dangerous fog. You see, I have bipolar disorder and autism. For which I gratefully receive professional care and support. To put all of this another way, this plant is the most important natural remedy in my life right now. Straight alongside my pharmaceutical medications; which are as equally important to/for me. I can't do this life without any of these medicines. It's the maintaining of a balance between the such tools (pharmaceuticals and cannabis) that enables my ability to enjoy and contribute to life. Which is my *great thirst*, to be an outstanding member of this human reality. Has been my whole life. She keeps me mellow and in check of my emotions, in sync with my self. Without cannabis, mindfulness is not possible. It's that simple. And I am not functional or happy without active mindfulness. A knowing that's taken me almost a decade to understand, integrate/accept and utilize. It's amazing how much more in control of my experiences I am with cannabis. Not only in control, but turned on in the sense of meta-cognition and creative agency. My mind's eye comes alive with cannabis inside my system(s). That #8217;s one of Her gifts. Thank you r/trees for helping me feel connected to others who understand that it's alright to be a stoner with mental illness and/or autism. That's the fierce truth. Have courage. **Edit** It's really excellent to see all of you. Thank you for being here in this moment.</TEXT>
