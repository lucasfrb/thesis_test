    <TEXT>I normally lurk and do not post or comment, but I came to say that this sub has done amazing wonders for my mental health. My healing process has been so much better knowing I'm not alone and having a safe place to vent anger, laugh about ridiculous TBM shit, and find stories of people living their best lives. I'm still struggling, but even reading these posts has lended me a hand. :)</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I hate the "you misunderstood the doctrine" argument. If it was that easy for a kid to "misunderstand" the doctrine, WHY WOULD YOU LET A CHILD CHOOSE TO DEVOTE THEIR ENTIRE LIVES TO SOMETHING THEY MISUNDERSTAND If adults get the teachings so mixed up, why are we trusting 8 year olds with such a difficult decision? I hardly trust 8 year olds with scissors.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>My TBM mom: you know, Joseph Smith was against slavery. Me (with a Bachelor's degree in US history): ...but mom, he pretty much owned slaves. Mom: Yes, but he was KIND to them. He owned slaves so that he could show them a better life. Me: so, why didn't he free them or pay them? Mom: He couldn't just do that! You don't know anything about church history. This is also the mom that claims "marrying older men at 14 was normal and common back then" (it most certainly wasn't, there was actually a trend of women marrying younger men in rural areas). I spent a lot of money and a lot of time getting my degrees. I'm 27 and going to be starting my PhD program this year. It is so frustrating that my mom (who has a degree in nursing and doesn't let anyone question her on those topics) doesn't seem to believe that I know what I'm talking about, and treats me as if I lost ALL knowledge as soon as I left the church. History has shown us that our heroes are extremely flawed. Teddy Roosevelt (one of my personal heroes) was racist and xenophobic, and I don't excuse his behavior, but I still think he was a great man otherwise and there are a lot of great qualities and ideas he had. We can have flawed heroes, appreciate what they do right, and acknowledge what they do wrong, and LEARN FROM THEM. If Mormons still love whatever good qualities they can find about JS, so be it, but recognizing his flaws AS FLAWS is the only way they will move forward. It would STRENGTHEN their cause to recognize it, and yet...they don't. Thanks for coming to my TED talk. End rant. Edited: clarity</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Sorry for not having more context/clarification. While there is no formal evidence of him owning slaves, he supported slave labor on the Nauvoo Temple and encouraged slave labor from slave owners of his congregation. I equate this to owning slaves, since he pretty much owned the congregation. Either way, he had the power to free them (by ordering it in the church) and he didn't. I can't find sources right now because I'm traveling, but here is a brief wiki: https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mormonism_and_slavery</TEXT>

Look into self compassion YouTube videos for coping meditation. Write. Remember that your anger is justified. You're almost through. If you ever need any support or advice from someone who has been there, feel free to dm me. I will listen without judgment. It DOES get better though. You might not believe it right now, but repeat it in your head. It gets better.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I just want to pat everyone here on the virtual back. Holy shit we have been through a lot, and it's so easy to be angry, but I've seen countless of examples of genuine compassion and friendship here that I never saw in the cult. You all give me hope with your willingness to pick others up, help out missionaries, give advice and comfort to those dealing with crashing shelves, and provide a safe harbor for folks (ESPECIALLY young folks) who face the rejection of their families. I was a teenager struggling in silence and living a double life for years in the church. It exacerbated my ptsd, depression, and anxiety to the point that I have more health problems than I would like to have. And I know that if I had a group like this, I would have felt so much more supported than I was on my journey. I don't regret it, but I wouldn't go back either. You people make a difference and I just want to let you know the impact I see here. Thank y'all for being alive.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>It sounds like he was safe, and it also sounds like he's not letting it interfere with work or anything, so I wouldn't worry too much about him being an alcoholic, OP. It's super great that you are looking out for your dad though. I agree with the comment above, validating him as a grown human who is allowed to get drunk and return safely to their own home is probably best. If you show your support and nonjudgment for him, he will definitely feel much safer talking to you about your shelf breaking when the time is right.</TEXT>

Call someone until they answer the phone and tell them you're not safe to be alone. And respond somewhere here so that we know you don't need a welfare check.

If you are into horror podcasts, I recommend creepy, SCP, and letsnotmeet. -read a book. There are a bunch of cheap/free kindle books. One I recommend is heroes of the frontier by dave eggers.

    <TEXT>I am reading a memoir of one of my favorite celebrities, and she says, "everything you prioritize above your sobriety is everything you will lose to your addiction." This really hit home. I can't focus on my schooling, or work, or finances, or family, or friends until I focus on my sobriety. I need to put my sobriety first, or my addiction will destroy all of those parts of my life. Every other time I've tried to stop drinking and using, I've always wanted to do it by focusing on these other things instead of focusing on my addiction and quieting its voice, and those times have all failed. Now it's time that I focus on my sobriety first, and allow all those other things to fall into place. Just some food for thought and a sobriety check in because my therapist advised me to share when I found good bits of reading. IWNDWYT!</TEXT>
