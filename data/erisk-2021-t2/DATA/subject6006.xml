    <TEXT>Snape kill Dumbledore? No way!, he only and only did it because of the curse. Snape would've been forced to drop his double A disguie, I think Dumbledore, he'd have allowed draco to mend the vanishing cabinet and then when he'd find that his real plan was to bring death eaters into school, he'd have fought them all, which would've been pretty easy, and then immediately putting Draco under order's protection. There's no way he would've just died, leaving harry with sorting Horcruxes all on his own.</TEXT>

    <TITLE>Help please with MODDED PES 2017</TITLE>
    <DATE>2020-05-24 07:37:31</DATE>
    <TEXT>Hi my computer is pretty shit, so i play pes 2017 instead of the newest installments, (although it's still pretty much the same except for graphics) Anyways my question is does anyone know wether or not can i just remove a stadium from the game files? Like is there anyway i can just delete a stadium or at least change it's ID. The reason i wanna do this is because in master league you can't change stadiums while playing fa cup or a leauge game, and the game always makes me play on a stupid stadium, so is there any way i can change the ids of a stadium with another so the game won't make me play on that one or can i delete a stadium from the whole. This might not be the right sub to ask this, but still if anyone could help me I'd be really happy!</TEXT>

How do you find the op's video condemning any harm? Or maybe she ain't ugly so she's not under the cringe list? Isn't that titktok's policy anyway?

    <TEXT>FIFA DOES THE JOB FOR ME, And no I'm not a EA fanboy, I've been playing PES/WE since 2006 And I'm done trying to patch man blue to man city every fucking year, Running siders for fucking scoreboards and entrance music, or Pretending fucking Metropole Arena as Wembley stadium. Jesus Christ fuck your realism, The experience that fifa provides while playing a EFL LEAUGE 2 match in a beautiful square closed pack English stadium is nothing compared to that stupid realism. And Commentary is utter bullshit, They have managed to get Peter Dury and Jim for the game and they haven't been made to do any good job, same limited and repetitive dialogues, as if he was charging them 500$ for a fucking syllable. At least I'll be able to enjoy some GOOD PL FOOTBALL In FIFA ,and won't have to pretend fucking St Jacob's Park as Villa Park. (And no I'm done with stadium packs they're too buggy) I know you hate everything about This post, I've been in your shoes for 15 years anyway, i know you can't wait to smash the downvote and i appreciate standing up for your game but deep down you feel it too, don't you?

I can share what i like and what i don't like about the game i played for so long?? I NEVER SAID IT'S A ISSUE THAT THEY DON'T HAVE ORIGINAL STADIUMS and THEY SHOULD FIX IT.

    <TEXT>look deaths were eminent, without deaths it's basically a fairy tale, ultimately all the characters are alive in our hearts anyway, so Im not saying that killing characters is what makes a series good but do you think if someone else had died instead of them the Canon would've made a whole different impact on readers? Like for me if Malfoy would've died it would've been a huge setback for The Malfoys and us fans too! Maybe it'd been interesting to see how Narcissca would've reacted in the Forbidden Forest, although i believe that would've strengthen her more to believe in Harry to put and end to Tom</TEXT>

    <TEXT>You and i agree on a lot of things, first off, i too wanted to see Harry defeating Voldemort not just because of a curse rebound, but something else. but again Harry is no match against Voldemort in a duel. And yeah the epilogue was very limited that's what give those mental authors to write anything in Cursed Child without any thought and making it into the Canon, ( which i too personally don't consider as Canon ) Like Hermoine as MoM? seriously? She specifically said she'd rather do anything than do a job in ministry, especially not being MoM in any given circumstances. Also Cursed Child is a very poorly written fan fiction, looks like someone watched movies and started typing shit. There's no way the Harry we know would say to his son that i wish you weren't my son, or to Ginny that I'm the one who Defeat Voldemort and stuff. Then his scar hurting out of nowhere is just some next level bullshit and it goes on and on. In relationships i really wanted to get someone's opinion like; In movies Harry and Hermoine looks perfect, no denying that, it's just that their chemistry is priceless,nand they've haf great scenes together, like in HBP and that dance in DH1, And Daniel and Bonny are just too off, it was they decided to make Ginny an entirely new character  #128514; In books every relationship is perfect, Hermoine perfect with ron and Ginny and Harry are awesome</TEXT>

    <TEXT>basically Voldemort and Bella had a child just sometime around the start of DH, when Tom was using Malfoy's Manor as his base (I KNOW YOU'RE LIKE WTFFFF) And yeah so he has a daughter and the story that follows after that in cursed child is absolutely nonsense, i may not tell you in case you wanna read it yourself. I consider it as a disgrace in the name of Harry Potter Anyways their theory and how they fixed that in the timeline is something I don't understand, cuz that would mean Bellatrix would be pregnant in BOH or maybe conceived the child just before it. Anyways the child is Delphini and she's beautiful and has Young Tom Riddle's features ofc Sorry for fucking your mind</TEXT>

    <TEXT>i was in a hurry so I didn't read your full answer but I'm going to read it as soon as i get time, but about the dragon thing, i first thought Voldemort could use dragons (especially those like in Gringotts trained to fear clankers) to weaken defenses of Hogwarts, like he could get Dragons accumulated at a spot in control with Clankers. And then make them run loose towards Hogwarts while his army remains behind. What i didn't thought was that the the opposition could get Clankers too and can control and stop the dragons so yeah they're pretty useless and More like a liability then an asset to Voldemort</TEXT>

And the game is very different then current FIFAs, because it has older match engine, so the passing sucks a bit, you won't be able to make innovative plays and passing sometimes. But it feels good, with updated teams and stuff, also all the original stadiums do make the game more enjoyable Other than gameplay, you've got your old FIFA features like requesting funds, news block, customizing Soundtrack, Chants, Stadium music etc. If you don't mind the graphics, this game is basically Fifa 20 Lite, it's good for people like me who can't run latest FIFAs on pc, and Love FIFA 14</TEXT>

    <TEXT>sell David luiz or Kolasinac sign a good center back, (i think Lascelles is good, but depends on your budget too), then sign a good first team quality left winger, Maybe San #233;, Rodrygo or maybe Demrai Gray, the more pacy the better. Then play 433, with auba as ST, and pepe on right of course. So basically this will make your team pacy and excellent for counter attacks, and if you still got money buy Phil Foden or Greenwood for squad rotation.

    <TEXT>Ok so... The PIF or the "Saudis" backed out on the Newcastle Deal right? And every one is like "it's Heartbreaking!", "It's Unfair!', "They deserve This!' And shit like that. So let me get this right, everywhere I go people take piss on us for buying the leauge, always taunt on us that we have oil money and stuff, and now when it's Newcastle they're saying that it's heartbreaking that the deal didn't happen??? Like when you talk about Manchester City, Everyone becomes a person, who "CARES" about Football and FFP, and you often hear "Saudi Billionaires shouldn't buy British Clubs!" And when it happens with Newcastle, nodody gives a damn? To me is just either proves that people just want to see the deal happen just because Newcastle had a lot of history and glory in the past. And we didn't. Another thing that bothers me is that no matter what happens, City is first on the list to be ripped on when you talk about Rich Owners buying Clubs. Like no one talks about Chelsea or Wolves! Cheslea owner is 2nd in line in terms of money after Sheikh, and he is spending like crazy as well! 70 mil for that shite of a goalkeeper Kepa, Then Timo Werner, and now potentially they could sign Havertz ad well for around 100 mil. Like why we are the only ones who are actually called out? Like how hard it is too understand that Football is A Global Business! The clubs who are rich now are definitely going to be better, and the clubs that have "rich history'' already had money in the past! No one talks about FFP or shows any awareness when owners of club like Wigan Athletic, Bury almost got clapped by the lack of sincerity of their owners, But everyone will come to display shithousery whenever City wins something. Thanks for hearing my rant, i need to hear what you lot things, I'm tired of the biased opinions of Non City Fans.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>(Read in Carragher's accent) Now what you got to see here, is that this cone is not only playing a no nonsense fullback but he is also playing an inverted quadrafiesta, in more of a supporting role. Now if analyze is further we can see that the cone is ready to commit rather than sit back and allooow the attack this can lead to an opening in the edge of the box, which leads to the goal we see here ah hahaha.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>in La Liga! and most of that wins were against relegation favourite sides, what's the last time you saw Madrid thrash a club like Chelsea or even Barca with More than 3 goals? They only gained momentum when zidane came back, without him they were losing back to back with Valverde's Barca! Tbh we were the better side so we won. Madrid were also very slow on the attack so a few casualties here and there in the defense and midfield didn't lead to anything, but that's not gonna happen against Bayern, if we keep giving away the ball and lose control in the midfield we're done mate.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Well Bella has proved from time to time that she has so many emotions for Tom, but I don't think he feels the same at all. At the end of the day Voldemort is a selfish and evil wizard who just can't feel any emotions of love, (Nagini being the exception cuz obviously she's a snake and has a part of his soul). To think about Voldemort loving literally anyone just doesn't feel right. So I think the reaction was mainly because of him losing his most faithful servant, in a middle of the Battle. Like look at this, he doesn't have snape, the Malfoys have lied to him and are useless, And now Bella's dead too, how long before The death eaters start running because there's no one to rile them up or command them, And Harry's still alive, somehow. So i guess it was just due to the anger and frustration. Also think it in this way, let's say Bellatrix ends up killing Dumbledore in HBP, now do you think Voldemort would spare her? Would Voldemort choose love over immortality? I mean it's just as Dumbledore says, If Voldemort knew how to Love, he wouldn't have became Voldemort in the first place.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>45% of the community makes good and funny posts pointing out the obvious circle jerk and cringe in r/soccer and other shit platforms, which is great Other 45% of the community unironically pitches memes of the same circlejerk topics and nobody cares. Like how can you make fun of a subreddit for their memes and then laugh at the same memes unironically. (Examples: Making fun of people in r/soccer for saying that Sevilla are Masters of EL and then Making like 10 memes about Sevilla unironically Similarly that Wolves is a Portuguese team joke) And the 10% of the community just posts football troll memes from 2012 which idk who tf enjoys.

    <TEXT>Maybe because they never fully recovered from the cost it took to build the Burrow. The only possible explanation i see is that they probably borrowed some money from their family then kept paying them later. then the 1st war broke out, again we can just assume like Dumbledore this war produced financial troubles for them maybe snatchers robbed them, etc so they probably had to start yet again after 1981, and because of Arthur's low income it took them a lot of time to gain stability. What do you think about this? (I don't remember if JK mentioned somewhere in the book wether the Wesley's built the borrow by their savings alone, if not, maybe they did borrowed it)</TEXT>

Idk about that article, it says EA did partnered with Serie A, but if so Both Juventus and Roma should be in fifa. Because PES has the same deal with Bayern Munich, MU and Liverpool and they are in the game, because EA has partnered with Bundesliga And PremierLeauge (as a Tech Partner.).</TEXT>

    <TEXT>It's a tradition, He's a legend that's why it's a big deal. Ever seen Beckham, Ronaldinho, Rivaldo, Puyol or literally any legend transferred for money after they decided to leave their respective clubs when they got old? The only problem is that Messi isn't doing this for retirement, he's doing this because he can't cooperate with the board anymore. That's the only reason club is demanding that 700m release clause. You should support Messi not oppose him. Do you know how disgraceful it is to hold Messi like that, like the club's already made millions because of that single man alone. Again just saying, I'm not a Barca fan, but I'm still giving an unbiased opinion, Bartemeu (idk how you spell that wank) still demands 700m instead of settling on a fee, which just proves he doesn't want money, he just don't want to be the president who got Messi out of Barca and wanna save his job.</TEXT>

This sub is way too unpredictable sometimes. I agree with all your answers, also for people who don't understand why there was a need to have so many people included in the task could be answered very easily, The order was sure to come, the more people, the more confusion, I just didn't understood why there was a need to bring Ron Hermoine, and the twins, surely they could've used the help of some other Order members. Anyway that's all i think was wrong with the plan, other than this, I don't think there was any better plan to move Harry.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>i just said it jokingly, but now that i think about it, let's say they tried to, and maybe Barto, considering how stupid he is refused to still let Messi go, thinking messi would never betray him. But it backfired, and Jorge Messi after meeting with Leo for final confirmation, leaked it in press. Honestly but this is too hypothetical and Hollywood, I don't think its anything like that, it's just pure and fresh KARMA.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Rapinoe? she #8217;s an oppressed victim of sexism, apparently. She has been at the #160;forefront #160;of the fake outrage and demands for "equal pay" compared to the men #8217;s football team. She has even encouraged the public shaming of FIFA President Gianni Infantino and filed a lawsuit against U.S. Football. I stand for fair wages for women in football, but you can't just public shame such a high ranking official who's representing your own country, this matters should be talked without the involvement of media. She's also a very bad role model for the country, because of her lack of appreciation for the country, she turned that beautiful win for US in the world cup final into a political pissing match. Here's how she defended her actions;  #160; #8220;I #8217;m not going to the f---ing White House. #8221; Plus, she has repeatedly knelt for the national anthem and said,  #8220;I #8217;ll probably never put my hand over my heart. I #8217;ll probably never sing the national anthem again. #8221; Then there was also a outrage when she dropped and stepped on the US flag while she was celebrating the win, she justified that she was only hated by people who just can't see women moving forward, but in reality this a very sensitive topic in football, Earlier people actually got absolutely rattled by Mustafi throwing the Captain's armband in a disappointing result for Arsenal in the Winter, so similar result for stepping on the US flag was ofc expected. Look I don't dislike her because she's a woman, i support Women football and fair wages as well, but she's still a very bad model to young people, the way she behaves and acts, and uses her fame. She also supports sexism and feminist ideologies, which I don't think helps even a little to restore gender quality.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I honestly don't know where to start, I feel so defeated and disconnected, i have no faith in the career I'm pursuing, i interact with 0 people on a daily basis, my family had been abusive my entire life, and I don't have any hope or something that would help me to live this life. I'll talk about all these one by one below My family has been abusive pretty much my whole life, both mentally and physically. They messed up my mind pretty bad, when i was a kid, they used to beat me up pathetically for making small mistakes like writing on the wall for instance. I was yelled and verbally used on a daily basis when i was a kid, and I don't know it just affected me mentally, whenever i get in a argument with someone i get numb legs and hands, i feel so insecure every time. I've never had been on a family vacation, I've spent my entire childhood, alone in front of the tv set watching football or cartoons. The abuse is only mental, now that I've grown up, they consider me as a failure now that I've failed to get into a prestigious university, and nodody cares when i argue how was i supposed to concentrate with you mentally torturing me every single day of my life for the past 18 years? There's not a single memory in fucking brain that can be labeled as a family moment. Even after i leave after school my problems not solve, i just don't feel connected with anyone anymore, I don't relate with the people of my country or their culture. I started using Twitter to interact with people with same interests, and it only lead to more depression and abuse by the Toxic people who hate you for having an argument. I just don't want to leave anymore, there's no point, my 18 years of life, my childhood is wasted, I've expressed so many times to my family that I just want to suicide (or run away) because i can't cope with them during our fights and all I've got from them is that it's not easy and i don't have the guts to do it. And i can't explain you how broken from inside I've felt each time I've heard that sentence, but I also can't deny that it's true, that's the only thing keeping me here.</TEXT>

But my question is I have used the same email and phone number in both the accounts so can Twitter suspend my main account as well, without doing anything, only because I've been already suspended once?</TEXT>

    <TEXT>What i think is that, Veil only works for living creatures, that aren't dead yet, Veil isn't deeply mentioned in the Canon, we can only guess from here. I think if a ghost were to pass through it, it would only pass through it as if it were a regular frame of a door, because ghosts can't achieve afterlife once they've chosen that path, so Basically an object like Veil shouldn't have any effect on them  #129300;.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Nah nah nah, this is very unrealistic tbh, Dumbledore would never let a 14yo boy, especially if he's Harry Potter, to compete in a task that's so dangerous and can be invaded by Voldemort's supporters  #129300;, just because he wants to find the imposter. That'd be impossible. Also Madam Maxime and Kakaroff rebelled strongly against that wether Harry should take part in that contest, but they only agreed because Barty Sr. ruled them out, as GOF binds a magical contract so nothing can happen, he'll have to participate at all cost. I think they and even Barty Sr wouldn't have agreed for Harry's participation if Only Dumbledore would have said it, that he needs Harry to find out who's behind this. "The GOF binds a magical contract" this is a more better excuse, magical contracts, vows or bonds can be deadly or harmful if not fulfilled (like the unbreakable vow)</TEXT>

    <TEXT>He wasn't asking him for the wand to continue flying, he just wanted any wand quickly enough to cast a Killing Curse on Harry , because they were getting nearer and nearer to the house of one of the Order's members which was protected by strong spells which Voldemort and his Allies won't bother breaking. So yeah Voldemort can fly without a wand, he has taken dark magic to such an extent, that he has unlocked and unleashed various kinds of talents. Flying and making a snake fit into Bathilda Bagshot's dead body as a host, are some of the examples of extreme dark magic</TEXT>

    <TEXT>yeah flying with wand isn't possible at all, you do have a lifting spell (Ascendio) that gives you a little flight and that's it. You can't fly with a wand. Voldemort is the only wizard who's known to fly without assistance, because he had exploited dark magic to an extreme level, that no one has ever done. Edit : Snape is an exception that I forgot to mention, he presumably learned to fly from Voldemort himself.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Ok ok so I'm excited to help First thing is that what type of content are you searching for? If you're interested to travel past When Dumbledore was young, then Fantasic Beasts is for you, with Newt Scamander as one of the main protagonist and Gellert Grindelwald as the antagonist. Sadly only text available there is the original screen play written by JK. Movies are pretty awesome and I'd highly recommend. And then there's cursed child, which is a theatre book/drama. Which takes place into the future where Harry is an adult. I'd highly recommend you to stay away from it if you Love Harry Potter  #128077; #127995;. Because First of all it's not written by JK, and tbh it looks like a very terrible fan fiction. Every character is a bit weird in that, especially Harry. You'd beg someone to obliviate the shit out of you once you finish reading it.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Tbf I don't really remember Malfoy meeting Fudge before the meeting, it was only shown in the movies, In the books Malfoy only visits the minister after the hearing. Even then nobody in their right mind would've even guessed that Harry would attempt to do something like this or Harry would actually break into the ministry. Also at this stage of the stroy Voldemort is assured that he doesn't need Harry to retrieve the prophecy, he just need to find a way to avoid the Order and somehow get the prophecy. So i think Harry seeing that door was just a mere coincidence.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>yeah but we don't know that do we, it's the good in you that make you see the goodness in them. We don't know how they raised Harry as an infant, they could've just left him alone with a maid or they could've left him hungry and crying trapped in the closet or something, or they could've left him ill or never cared, until several days. Again i highly doubt that Petunia took care of a baby harry by herself. Being raised in an abusive family myself, just because someone raised an infant and he survived his early years doesn't mean they obviously did a wonderful job at it as well.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>i mean he was only in his second year and Dumbledore didn't closely knew Ron. Also at the end of the day they were just kids and I don't think they would dare ask or even visit the headmaster of Hogwarts to repair their wand? Apart from that, I just think it's not a common issue so, if a wand breaks people just buy their kids a new one, it's just that Weasleys were poor so ron had to use spellotape etc.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Well ig what we can do from this point is just take a guess from instances in real life. Comparing This to real life, Teachers are really busy, they have to organize lessons of different classes, hold detentions and do loads of works, so ig McGonagall just Didn't focused much on that. It's possible that McGonagall could've asked Dumbledore to fix that but that doesn't mean it was a necessity or a school rule that she must have to inform him about a broken wand .So she didn't and Dumbledore probably never knew. Also he's Harry's friend but doesn't mean that Dumbledore would automatically know if Ron's wand is broken</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Maybe that or Maybe the reason that he's brave? It takes a lot of courage and bravery to stand up to your family? and Tell them you believe in something they don't? And it takes even more courage to come and apologize infront of your loved ones that you were wrong. Apart from that he's a brave guy overall, fought in the battle, was willing to fight and sacrifice himself when fred died to avenge him etc. He's a Gryffindor all day, everyday.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>yeah i understand what are you saying, but tbh I really don't understand how Percy belongs in Slytherin? (And why people think so) I don't think he's very clever? He's probably intelligent yes but i think he's very naive as he didn't understood one bit of what was going on in the ministry until it was very late lol. Anyway i think yeah what you're saying is correct and Slytherin is seen as a "bad" house in wizarding families who aren't Slytherin themselves and especially gryffindor families (as indicated by Ron, in the first book), so ig he could've asked the hat to put him in Gryffindor rather.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I've Definitely got it This time, Actually the thing's that McGonagall never knew Dumbledore had the elder wand did she?? If she didn't she wouldn't have guessed that Dumbledore can actually repair Ron's wand! Because it's impossible to repair wands that are broken in halves. Even then even Ollivander didn't knew that broken wands can be fixed by the elder wand, so she'd have never thought of that!! I think this is pretty reasonable?</TEXT>

    <TEXT>The main plot was that Malfoy is confident that Voldemort is gone forever, and he's trying to get rid of all the dark objects and artifacts in his house that has anything to do with Voldemort etc. Also he hates the Weasleys, so he slips the diary into Ginny's cauldron, hoping that the diary would posess Ginny and make her open the COS, and somehow if Ginny was caught it will make Arthur to resign from his job. The death of muggleborns would just be a bonus. This above here is the Main plot, and plan that Malfoy was working on, Dobby just warned Harry, because he thought Harry could get killed if he went to Hogwarts as the Slytherin's monster would be unleashed. Regarding the fact what would have happen if If Ginny died? I'm not sure, I think a 16y Tom with his current memory would have been reincarnated.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Some of things i wanted to see in the movies were; Voldemort's past, and the story of how he was convinced, his young manipulative and especially a scene from the the chapter "Lord Voldemort's Request". It would've added so much chilliness to the movie, BUT instead they spent useless time on focusing on teenage relationships that too b/w Lavender and Ron , which wasn't even mean to be special, i really hate it. I mean some scenes were ok, but i think they could've fit Voldemort's Past moments instead, it would've made it more intense. Another scene i wanted to see in the same movie HBP, was Dumbledore's funeral, i know it's a lot because you can't add everything to a movie, but i think if we can remove unnecessary scenes from movies (like Ginny and Harry kissing in fk ROR) and replace them With Ginny and Harry talking together in the Dumbledore's Funeral along the lake, it would be really romantic and people who complain that there was no chem b/w Bonny and Dan would feel different? I think Ginny and Harry should have had more scenes together. And the last thing would be Maruders' Childhood. Don't know how they would fit it in tho, whilst not making the movie longer</TEXT>

    <TEXT>umm it actually depends on you and your nature. Like I'm kind of the person that gets irritated if the movie has something different than the Books, Even though i watched the movies first, before reading the books. After reading the books i just feel uncomfortable watching some of the scenes if they were portrayed different in the books. So what i meant was are you like me? And if you don't know too, ig you can give it a week or two and then just start Sorcerer's Stone? And see how you feel.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>1. I honestly don't know why he didn't has any big role, even in DH too. This only leads us to one thing that is, maybe plot convinience? maybe JK just wanted Bella to have a connection with the Lestranges? 2. Now this is a very good question. The thing is that whatever happened in that courtroom, died in that courtroom. Only the ministry officials, Bella and Rodo knew that Barty Jr was pleading. And ministry officials are out of the conversation, Bella and Rodo were imprisoned anyway. So Voldemort never knew! He just thought that out of all the people he was the one who came to rescue him. And we all know it took a year more for Bella to come out ot Azkban and Barty was already dead by that point.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I'm a bit confused but i think what you wanted to ask basically is that wether Horace returned to the battle willingly or unwillingly (because of peer pressure or something)? Yeah? If that's the question, i think yes he stayed to fight against the death eaters and Voldemort himself willingly. He's a Slytherin, he has the traits of a true Slytherin but he's also a bit brave and a great fighter/wizard. Just like Snape, i think he loved Lilly as his dear student and he obviously loves Harry and If a 18yo can show so much bravery, i think this just inspired slughorn to give it all, no matter what happens, as he was fighting with Lord Voldemort himself in the finishing stages of the book. xx</TEXT>

Several times during the fighting period of Ron and Hermoine, Harry has stated that he enjoyed spending time with Ron more than Hermoine. Because she would always be serious and remind him to do homework etc.. In the movies however the Chemistry of Dan and Emma is just completely different, They look very good together, they have great moments together, like the two scenes in HBP (Hermoine crying on Harry's shoulders and they both having a laugh in Library) and that dance in DH. So ig they look like a perfect couple, and a better one than Dan and Bonny (Personal Opinion that)</TEXT>

    <TEXT>It's very easy once you understand the concept Our Premier Leauge's differential equation can be rewritten as s'(t) = (k/m)[(mg/k) - s(t)] We now introduce the auxilliary function p(t) = (mg/k) - s(t), so that p'(t) = -s'(t). Rewriting the equation in terms of p, we have -p'(t) = (k/m)p(t) or p'(t) = (-k/m)p(t) Now we see that #160;the auxilliary function p is proportional to its derivative. An important fact from Differential Calculus is that any function that is proportional to its own derivative #160;must be an exponential function. More explicitly, there is a constant C such that [Wow!!! How'd that happen?!?! p(t) = Ce(-k/m)t. Rewriting this in terms of the speed function s = (mg/k) - p, we find that s(t) = (mg/k) - Ce(-k/m)t. We can use the initial condition s(0) = 0 to determine the constant C: 0 = s(0) = (mg/k) - Ce0 #160;= (mg/k) - C so C = mg/k. Hence United are 16th so which proves my theory.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Read the bloody books first then, it's such a fine piece of Literature, immense and carefully planned for-shadowing, a great villian and a perfect storyline? The problem with you is that, you've just watched a movie that was made in 2001 and the protagonist was 10 yo, so it looks like a fucking fairly tale to you What you've got to understand is that when you read the books you realize that JK's writing improves a lot as Harry grows up, The quality of writing in DH compared to that of PS is unmatchable, and the books become even darker as you proceed. If you've judged the series by watching the first movie, you're just missing 99% of the things and excitement that are yet to come. Even then if the first book/movie doesn't hook you,then probably you're not interested in these kind of Fictions, or stories related to parental love and power of friendship etc......</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Are there any charms or spells that are mentioned in the Canon which can be applied on a broom stick to keep it on a certain height? Or like any kind of charm that you can use on a broomstick? Also aresto momentum isn't a spell that can be applied to the whole mass of a body (Like a piece of land in this instance), It's only applicable to an alive falling body. And I don't think a similar spell exists for such purpose?</TEXT>

    <TEXT>The thing to understand here is that This Law is not a "scientific law", and what i mean by that is, you can't argue that Food and Medicine can basically be same on molecular basis etc . This is a magical law, and i think it can differentiate b/w food and medicine. Food is something that a wizard would need to survive or sustain himself, while an antitode or medicine is just for counteracting ill or poisonous substances from your body. So food can't be produced in thin air, but medicines can be (dk wether there's also a charm for that but RR can present it to it's user) Idk if this made sense to you  #128517;, it perfectly makes sense to me. Food and Medicine might have a chemical relevance irl, but a magical law can differentiate them</TEXT>

And he kinda sacrificed his life to save him and avenge Lily, And also there's nothing to be "deluded" here, It's my opinion, JK didn't released a series on Snape did she? Series is told to us from Harry's pov, we don't know what's Snape's inner feelings are anyway, so i can have an opinion or my own theory about what he feels about him.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Considering the possibility or assuming that Fudge was under the imperuis curse, I think he must be cursed before OOTP. Maybe somewhere in the timeline of GOF. The reason why i think that is because, as you were saying Fudge was pretty much mentally prepared that Sirius could get Voldemort back in power, but this is such a high contrast to how he behaved when Harry came back from the graveyard that night in GOF. He summoned the dementor, which left Dumbledore amused too because it instantly sucked Barty Jr's soul and hence killed the only witness and the way he argued with Dumbledore that no matter what Voldemort can't return in the hospital wing was unreal. But But But, the thing is that how and who managed to keep him under the imperuis curse for over an year? And even after that how did the imperuis curse break? Why did he not asked or confided in Dumbledore that he was under the curse? It's a good theory but idk</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I didn't meant to say that it'll be difficult to curse Fudge or something, I meant that imperuis curse is only temporary, and to keep Fudge under it he must be cursed periodically and regularly? So does that mean Malfoy used to meet him on a regular basis, several times a year? And what happened once Malfoy was sent to Azkban? If I'm correct He's the only Death Eater who's close to Fudge? Who would've kept him under the curse after Malfoy was imprisoned? That's all.</TEXT>

Harry and Ron would struggle, doesn't matter which book, her cleverness and her ability, her knowledge, her smartness is what they need to get on with their task or missions.

    <TEXT>Umm maybe because they don't wanna kill? Remember that people like Harry prefer to avoid using curses? Also answer to everything isn't killing? Let's say in real life a murderous lunatic is getting chased by the police? I think the first thing officers would want to do is stop him and electrocute him or something? Probably not kill him #129300; Killing the death eaters that might have some valuable information would be a stupid option, but capturing and stunning them and using Veritaserum, would probably be a far better option. Also if the target is pretty dangerous then remember that ministry had once given authority to the Aurors to use the curse.</TEXT>

Any teen - adult, reading this must've seen a dolphin somewhere? like you don't have to visit the ocean, you could've known through a picture or from a book? The op isn't downvoted for having an opinion, it's because it's Reddit and you can't generalize something on the basis of a personal experience. Just because you didn't saw a dolphin growing up doesn't mean anything, me and my 30 classmates grew up in a classroom which had a big dolphin poster, with everything explained  #128514;, meaning : You can't generalize something from a person opinion unless you've done a survey of something.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Gary Gary Gary, he's amazing nobody could've played Sirius better than him imo, his acting the way he talks is just perfect, brilliant. His scenes are so satisfying to watch, Sirius Black is my favorite character in the canon and Gary made it even more fascinating. The chilliness in his acting, when he warns Harry that dark times are approaching, the calmness and seriousness in his voice when he's guiding harry, the authority in his acting when he's arguing with snape, it reeks Book Sirius. Literally everything about him is amazing. But all of that only for JK to kill him so early #128557;, can't be arsed, everyone i love just die</TEXT>

I'd say what Aguero did was cringy yes, but that's not my point, I'm saying that you can't call this physical aggression? That's a very wrong take on this matter? And people are saying as if she was abused and wasn't able to speak for herself? That's just so stupid, she's 35 for God's sake i swear if she would've found it uncomfortable she'd have asked the ref to book him. People are including politics in this that women shouldn't be allowed in men's game, that women can't defend themselves because of men like Aguero??? That's just a very wrong take, it had to br addressed . Another thing regarding this matter is; This things happen with Male refs all the wretched time? Why it's a "Physical aggression" when it's a Women? Paul pogba Kept his hand on Mike Dean's blad head, why the double standards eh? You can call what Aguero did cringy or uncomfortable, but that's not a physical aggression or a sexual harassment, that women in the picture claimed that Aguero has shown physical aggression towards her (i didn't included her every tweet you're free to check out yourself), that's why i madr this post xx</TEXT>

    <TEXT>First of all what he have to focus on is that Grindelwald mainly never operated in England, his criminal activities were mainly reported from other parts of Europe, even America (if you include Fantasic Beasts in your headcanon). We know why it was so, obviously because presence of Dumbledore in Hogwarts always kept Grindelwald clear. Now let's imagine Tom Riddle in the timeline before the year 1945. He's a Hogwarts student, He has killed his dad and grandparents, he has successfully opened the ancient COS, killed a girl, has created 2 horcruxes, and has a small army of his fellow companions calling themselves the Death Eaters. Certainly I don't think Voldemort cared enough about a wizard who was causing disruptions in other nations far away? Voldemort's main task at this stage of his life was gaining immortality and working in shadows, he doesn't care about world domination right now, he is only obsessed with immortality, He just want to make horcruxes, when he'll make enough he'll probably come out of the shadows and see who wants to challenge him or who stands in his way. And we all know when that happened? Probably in the 60s -70s was when he was skilled enough and had created enough horcruxes that he felt the need to come out of the shadows and start a new range of terrors (What i mean by that is in the chapter Lord Voldemort's Request, Dumbledore tells us that when Tom disappeared from Borgin and Burke's he wasn't seen by anyone for quite a time after that but then when he returned to Hogwarts, his name was already getting famous amongst people) So my view is that : Tom never cared about Grindelwald, he wasn't on his mind in his Hogwarts years, He just wanted to lay low and complete his tasks, one of them was Killing mudbloods which failed, other was to rip soul into 7 pieces, which was successful.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>It's not about the importance of the object, it's about wether Voldemort was confident enough? According to him, he has already split his soul into 7 parts (which is not correct obviously), so would he want to make another horcrux? Does he know that he has destroyed his soul to a very dangerous extent? We don't know, he doesn't even know at this stage that the horcrux in his diary is destroyed. Nevertheless his main aim wad NOT to make a new horcrux, his only obsession was to get back into human form and kill Harry, so we can't say if he even cared enough about other topics.</TEXT>
