    <TEXT>For some reason. I can't get refresh rate switching to work inside kodi 18 unless I turn off mediacode surface. Turning this codec off means I won't be able to play hdr or Netflix streams (kodi addon) Is there a way for me to get refresh rate switching and hdr using this app?</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I completely understand your reaction. I have read the suggestions in the other thread. But I see this as a last resort. Believe me when I tell you I have tried everything to get mediacodec surface and refresh rate switching to work. However it is not only kodi that will benefit from this tool, also Netflix etc. This tool will help my viewing experience overall. So I'm thankful this exists.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>It would only wouldn't be worth it if they released a version and stripped some features. For instance, the 2015 has an SD card slot and the 2017 version doesn't. Anyway I can't seem to think of features that can be stripped without compromise. The new shield will definitely be just as great as the previous versions, and if not, (noticeably) better.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I want to backup my switch so when things go wrong I can easily restore it. But the important question here is: what kind of setup do I have? I currently boot sx os off of an SD card. I can use the sx os bootloader to start official or custom firmware. When there are ofw firmwares I just boot to ofw and officially perform the update. Then i boot to the cfw and see that the ofw update also affects the cfw version. Can anyone explain if I have emunand? Also, is it a good enough measure to backup my nand or do I need to extra things to properly backup and restore my switch when needed? FYI Im running latest 8.1 firmware on both ofw and cfw. I don't plan on running different FW versions on ofw and cfw.(i don't even think I can with this setup) Ps. I tried to read up online but I got confused with all the emunand methods and terms..</TEXT>

    <TEXT>While I do not have other color bulbs, I do have the gu10 color. Green is not really green. It is more like a yellow tint. If you really want gu10 then you'll want the "richer color" version. The richer color version does a way better job at showing green. There's a video on YouTube showing the difference between the old gu10 green and new gu10 green. This newer version just came out. You'll know it's a richer color gu10 if it says "richer color" on the box. This new version also has Bluetooth so if it has a Bluetooth logo on the box then it's definitely a richer color version.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I found out that you can long press the app icons to pin them down. The pinned down apps stay at the top. The downside is that the pinned down apps are in alphabetical order and cannot be moved around. This is only applicable to the general app sharing icons. What frustrates me the most is the upper rows of specific app sharing always pops up late and unwanted. Resulting in me pressing something I didn't want to press. General app sharing: like share to whatsapp/outlook etc Specific app sharing: like sharing to whatsapp contacts or mail contacts.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Me, my two friends and one blueberry were running against a sweaty 4-stack. I think we were at about 3000 points in comp. One of my friends died, then I died and blueberry was out there trying to 1v4 like there was no tomorrow. My last surviving friend is pretty new to comp so I stressed him to just stay behind cover and revive me. Then I made this play. He also got in my way when I slid towards my other friend to survive him. I was yelling and cussing in my mic like crazy. Thought you guys might enjoy. We didn't end up winning against this team though. Ps. Notice the arc web my buddy throws after I revive him. It was an arcweb and blade barrage combo. Also, my super was charged just in time.</TEXT>

A tutorial on connecting yatse to kodi should also be on YouTube. Sending the commands from yatse to kodi can be a bit cumbersome but there are lists of commands available on the kodi wiki.

    <TITLE>Is there a way to send commands to Google assistant?</TITLE>
    <DATE>2019-10-10 11:24:53</DATE>
    <TEXT>Hi, I was wondering if this is possible: Feed Google assistant an intent or something so I can make Google assistant perform an activity without actual voice input. Example: a task that feeds Google assistant the command: play 'series' in the living room. And then Google assistant executes that command. There's probably an autoinput way, but I want this to be clean and performed in the background. So preferably not with the use of autoinput. Is this possible? Edit: ended up using this: https://www.reddit.com/r/tasker/comments/agm6nk/howto_send_a_google_assistant_command_from_tasker/ Fyi: when screen is off, executing this task says your command out loud so the assistant can hear it. This all happens in the background and with the screen off. If you start the task while the screen is on, then it will input the command as text and then the assistant will execute it.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I went through this a week ago. Was about to pull my hair out. The main thing you want to look out for is to NOT add the shield as a cast device in the google home app. Doing so doesn't give you full control over the shield. Instead, it should appear as a Google assistant device and must be added as such. Now I've gone mad trying to get the shield to appear in the home app as a Google assistant device. My issue was that the google assistant was never enabled on the shield. So first things first. Launch google assistant once from the shield home screen (press on the voice search bar) and set it up. Then reboot and it should appear in the home app.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Try removing the shield as a "cast" version from the home app. I do not know the exact solution for this problem. Adding the shield is cumbersome and there is not 1 universal solution to successfully do it. Even I am afraid to replicate my steps to be able to show you because I might run into the same issues as you're having... I'll see if I can think of something that might help you.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I always loved the class mod titles in borderlands 2. I.E; legendary mechromancer, anarchist, roboteer and many more. This not only made me stand out and shows my hard earned loot off, it also showed my teammates what kind of build or setup I was running. I remember farming terramorphous in bl2 and seeing random teammates joining me with the legendary slayer of terramorphous title, I knew I was in for a good fight instead of a beat down. Also, you can tell someone is inexperienced when they have nonsensical mods for the kind of battle you're having. Without these titles in borderlands 3 I feel like everyone is generic; gunner, beastmaster, siren and operative. You don't really know what kind of setup or playstyle someone is running until you really pay attention to how they are playing. We really need to feel more unique in borderlands 3, so please, add class mod titles.</TEXT>

Maybe you could try and find out if 'digital output level' has an app/package? Inspect your installed apps/system apps. You need to know it the activity can be called by letting tasker open an app or package.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>It's a Netflix issue. I'm running the Netflix kodi addon and can sometimes pick two or three types of English subtitles. These subtitles are directly pulled from Netflix servers. It's always one of these that has the behavior you described : it displays a half of sentence and it never follows it up and just waits for a new sentence to just show half of. Try to see if the Netflix app has an option to pick a different subtitle for English.</TEXT>

    <DATE>2020-02-16 09:36:51</DATE>
    <TEXT>Hi guys, I'm starting to get into home networking and I am planning to purchase a ubiquiti usg router. I am somewhat confused about the 'voip' port of the usg router. I am planning to replace my current router/modem. The idea is this: -Current router/modem is put in bridged mode and connects to the wan port. -A ubiquiti switch connects to the lan port -The voip port is configured as lan2 but it will get a different ip address (10.0.0.something?) Can I use the voip(now lan2) port to connect a switch and will it behave the same as the switch connected to lan1?</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I'm confused, surely you use a windows or Linux device to download the movies? Why not start the rename process on either of those devices. Also, if you have an hdd connected to the shield with the movies on it then you can pop it in a windows or Linux device to do renaming. There just aren't any tools around for Android I'm afraid.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I get that. If my shield dies now I would probably have to work over a week to rebuild it. It took months to build my kodi, tasker and other automation apps. It's best to create backups of those apps entirely. The Android tv system itself is easy to set up. Just focus on the apps you primarily use (or have working in background) and create backups for those.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I have the 2015 model and I'm happy with the SD card slot. I run a lot of apps and they take up a lot of space. I don't see myself upgrading to a newer model and the sole reason for that is the missing SD card slot. Also I don't think it's worth the upgrade because I don't use the official remote/controller and can live fine without Dolby vision or AI upscaling. Perhaps if they upgraded a future model with decent built in storage, then I'll upgrade. 2015 model is still going strong anyways. It basically has the same performance of the newer models (excluding the tube)</TEXT>

    <TEXT>It's normal. Power off = completely off. I think the Shield even gives a warning that a controller or remote will not turn it back on. This warning should be seen when using the turn off feature. Always use 'sleep'. It's a suspend feature and the remote can wake the shield. Edit: you should be able to wake/turn on the shield using the button on the device itself. Even when completely off. You shouldn't have to replug it..</TEXT>

    <TEXT>You made me realize that I've done all I can to try and get judder-free playback from the shield using the device's settings. I have looked at an in-depth review site and found several TV settings that helped my playback get judder-free. I kept the Shield settings as they were, you know, the recommended settings. I have switched on 'real cinema' and 'trumotion' and it's judder-free now! I just need to find the right balance between tini tiny artifacts (barely noticeable) and smoothness. I know that people might advice me to turn off all motion interpolation but hey, this worked for me. And I still don't get how I could've achieved this without the TV settings. I have tried every method/setting I could find on the internet, except factory reset. I also know that there are a lot of people out there that have the same problem with the shield. I wonder why my shield just doesn't play the content smooth, but I no longer have to look for a fix.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I have considered rooting or flashing my shield with custom roms but I never actually felt it was necessary to do so. I took a hard look at my main goals and realized that I might not even need root/custom rom. All my main goals are now achieved with a stock but heavily customized shield. Those goals also include disabling packages and blocking ads. Disabling packages through adb is straightforward and the same process for the shield as other android devices. Always be careful disabling packages. If it seems risky, then don't do it. I have gone as far as disabling packages that retrieve ota updates. Disabling the play store could mess up Google services for YouTube and such. Just try it out I guess? I've just seen the option to disable the play store from settings-apps-googleplaystore Here are some useful adb commands : -Disabled packages list: adb shell pm list packages -d -Disable: adb shell pm disable-user --user 0 com.package.name -Enable: adb shell pm enable com.package.name</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I don't know much about plex but isn't plex just transcoding? Or the file had multiple codecs and plex chooses the one that does play? You can manually select audio streams in kodi by playing the movie and then enter the audio settings from the osd.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Could be a wonky CEC implementation in one of your devices. CEC is a 'standard' but every manufacturer does its own thing with it. This means sometime you just can't get device A to turn itself on or device B to change volume. Try disabling CEC for a a day or two and see if the problem persists.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Might be corrupted databases cause you opened them with a third party app. Android doesn't expect you to do that. Always copy important files and only fiddle with the copy. Leave the original intact and nothing bad can happen. This is pure speculation but a very good method when prying in system folders.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Hi, A few years back I changed my density using adb. I've done that because one particular app wouldn't display right (non native Android tv app) Now I'm looking into changing dpi on a per app basis but I need to know what the default density is. Can anyone run an adb command that shows default density? Just run the command: adb shell wm density</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Nice! Yes it's CastagnaIT's plugin. Resuming works well. I have the 2015 shield tv so no DV for me:(. I don't know if DV will work through the kodi addon. I've been dying to know if it works cause it will give me a reason to upgrade my shield. The best thing about the Netflix addon is that I have imported Netflix titles into my library and it works perfectly.</TEXT>
