    <TITLE>Intro and Truck Groups</TITLE>
    <DATE>2019-03-01 01:50:51</DATE>
    <TEXT>Hey, folks! Finally decided to make a Reddit username (long time reader) and my first post is here. Attached a picture of my 2018 2500. I went from a black 2012 1500 Quad Cab to this monster and couldn't be happier. I've got plans in the future for modifications and stuff though. Does anyone know of truck groups around the GA area? I'm military and moved from CO to GA and wouldn't mind meeting up. https://preview.redd.it/8creqd2fyej21.png?width=595 amp;format=png amp;auto=webp amp;s=8a6e8a3a192a79656d1ba5eac48608c7f3fe514f</TEXT>

    <TEXT> gt; Use it like a debit card This. So much this. A lot of people see that credit limit and think that equates to their bank account. As long as you're ONLY spending on it is backed by real cash (within your budget), you'll always have the money on hand to pay it off. Credit cards are amazing when used appropriately and responsibly. Problem is people never use them that way.  #8203;</TEXT>

    <TITLE>Off-Road / Work Balancing Act</TITLE>
    <DATE>2019-03-30 16:55:40</DATE>
    <TEXT>Hey folks, looking for a bit of discussion and opinions with regard to the title for those of you who use your truck daily (getting to work, towing, etc.) and also want to explore off pavement. A bit of backstory, I had a Ram 1500 previously with a 4" BDS lift on 35x12.5R20 Nitto M/Ts. Between the power that got sucked out of the Hemi, the need for a regear if I wanted some power back, MPG, etc. I started to doubt whether loading it down with bumper replacements, a winch, and other off-road items was going to be worth it. It looked fantastic though.  #8203; Fast forward to a few years ago I made the jump to a 2500 Laramie with a CTD. Moved from CO to GA for work (military) towing a car (light weight for the diesel) and have made a few modifications. But, I'm at the heavily debated point of deciding on lift/level and tire sizes.  #8203; I love the look of AEV vehicles and their function off-road is amazing. However, the practicality of running 40" tires driving 35-45min to work every day is worth debate. Being in the service I see my vehicle as not only something for me, but a rescue vehicle as well. There have been times in CO for example of needing to pull people out of ditches. Or, in the event of exploring, self recovery.  #8203; What this all boils down to is, how do you all find that balance between going off-road and what is TRULY required, with having a non-Brodozer truck that still maintains decent MPG and road capabilities? This pulls into the conversation of 37s vs. 35s, replacement bumpers and their necessity, mud flaps or running boards for protection, M/T vs. A/T tires, and all that.  #8203; Thoughts?  #8203; TLDR: With so many things that work well on the road and don't work well off-road (and the other way around), how do you balance that with your rig?</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Just out of curiosity, how does that make sense financially? The fee is not a required expense.  #8203; At 2% point return: $1000 = 20 points $1000 + $60 fee = $1060 = 21.2 points  #8203; So, unless my math is wrong, you're paying an extra $60 just to earn 21.2 points instead of paying via bank and earning 0 points. Would you pay $60 for 21 miles in an airline program? I'm honestly just not sure what the rationale is behind paying a fee like that to get a point return. Seems like the extra $60 nullifies it. I get people want to maximize their rewards, but paying fees to do so seems no different than paying interest on the credit card itself.  #8203; Edit: spelling</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Awesome answer and I appreciate the feedback! That's a lot of what I was thinking so it's good to hear the same. Wheel recommendations fall into that as well. I know for a lot of guys, they get these 20x10 wheels that are super fancy and that seems counter to off-road use. Additionally, the toss up between 18" and 20" wheels and how they affect load and off-road (side wall) protection are considerations too. I had Fuel wheels before and considered going with them again, but I'm still in debate.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Yea, no problems buying what I want. It's just, I don't know where that balance is right now. I'm leaning toward 35x12.5 (Ridge Grappler has some great reviews about durability and off-road performance). The driving is the hard part as, when I move again, I might need to drive to the west coast next. I have to keep that travel in mind.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Don't the 20" wheels help keep the total load better though? Looking at some R18 tires, the load rating goes to a D from an E or F. Maybe for 35s it might not be as bad.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Even for a minimum spend goal, I question blowing extra money for it. To me, the idea is that you hit that spending already buying the things you need to or that are already in your budget. Looking to spend excess money (like in fees) to reach a spend goal seems to pull away from the bonus in points.  #8203; Works best IMO if you're like, "I need a new computer upgrade and was already planning on spending the money," for example. Just my two cents!</TEXT>

    <TEXT>**Just looking to see if I'm on the right track for investing risk and selected funds in my Roth IRA.** I'm 34 and 7 years from a full military pension. After retirement, I do plan on getting another job working computer security or something along those lines and will continue to contribute to my Roth IRA. Right now, I have the following: * Fidelity Roth IRA \~$36.5k * Roth TSP \~$5k * Pension @ 61 (compensation calc only gets me this close to 65) assuming I retire right at 20 years of service \~$61,786.84/yr  #8203; Some notes regarding all of those. 1. The pension piece might go up if I stay in longer, or get promoted at 20 and do another 3 years to pull "high 3" for that base pay. 2. The Roth TSP was started SUPER late. 5% of current pay goes to it in a target date fund of 2050. 3. Roth IRA was started when I was 28. It's currently 65% domestic stock, 25% international stock, and 10% bonds.  #8203; For the actual funds in my Roth, it's: * FSKAX (Total Market - 65%) * FXNAX (U.S. Bond - 10%) * FSPSX (Intl Index - 25%)  #8203; Goal is to retire around 65 and have around $100k/yr. Which means I'll need to pull another $40k/yr from my Roth IRA. Assuming 7% each year in gains, that's around $570k when I'm that old if my math checks.  #8203; Thoughts and opinions are definitely welcome! Would other index funds be better? Should I do more risk? Less risk? Honestly not looking for anything too specific as long as this is a decent plan of attack. Thanks!</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Listen, points are cool and all, but they shouldn't COST you anything. The whole point of gaining rewards, in my opinion, is to get something for free. Stuff you can use for reward travel by simply paying for the things you already do. It's why the advice is always the same to never pay interest on a reward CC because it negates the points.  #8203; What you're doing paying a fee to gain rewards is essentially paying that interest in another form. As you just mentioned, the amount you gain in points is offset by paying a fee to pay your rent. To me, and I would advise others, it's not worth it.  #8203; Look at it this way. If UR are 1cpp, would you pay someone $1001 to have them give you back $865.80? No. It's better to just use the $1001 for travel.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Thanks for the input! Good to know things don't look too crazy. I was planning on increasing bond allocations once I hit 35 or 40 and then regularly after that. I had seen some suggestions about taking your age and subtracting from 120 to find your stock percentages so I was going a little more risky than that. Primarily because I could theoretically stay in the service (if promoted at 20yrs) for another 3. At that point, my annual would increase to **$88,851.50/yr at 61 by pension alone.** Again, that's an assumption I need to consider (the promotion part).  #8203; Honestly, I was trying to play catch up a bit since I waited late to start my IRA too.

    <TEXT>Is it a daily driver? Sure. Power to spare? You bet. Just keep in mind diesels aren't a fan of a lot of short trips. Plus, you'll need to deal with Diesel Exhaust Fluid (DEF) unless you risk a delete.  #8203; As for the ride, it handles itself very well for its size. I don't feel like I'm really driving a vehicle that big. I will be blunt though, when not loaded, the suspension is very stiff. The rear tires are stock 75-80psi so hitting a bump can be "jarring". So, if you're not pulling or hauling, expect a stiff ride.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I'm by no means a mechanic, but I researched diesel engines a lot before I purchased. They work off extremely high pressures and heat (diesel engines have no spark plugs). So, a bunch of short trips and heat/cold cycles aren't good for the engine. Especially when the engine can't reach it's normal operating temperature. Not saying you can't do short trips, it's just harder on the engine.  #8203; You'll need to use DEF in addition to diesel on a newer truck as a part of the EPA requirements for emissions. My truck has a 5gal DEF tank that gets me about 5000mi or so on a tank. It's not expensive, just another thing that gas vehicles don't worry about. You can remove the particulate filter (another EPA requirement), EGR, and DEF requirements by "deleting" the truck. But, you're technically doing something illegal. Why would you do it? Well, to not deal with DEF and get more power and efficiency. My truck still has its emissions components.</TEXT>

    <TITLE>Counting Cards - How many is too much or little?</TITLE>
    <DATE>2019-05-12 02:06:43</DATE>
    <TEXT>I know some people who churn can have a lot of credit cards, and some people prefer as few as possible. With the impact closing accounts can have (if it's a long held account) for switching from one card to another, it kinda forces us to hold onto some cards we probably would remove otherwise. Where does the community see as a normal/proper amount of credit cards? Personally, I have five right now (BOA Cash Rewards - oldest, CFU, CF, CSR, AMEX Plat) and balancing the rewards on them does take some effort. How do you define what is the right amount for you?  #8203; EDIT: Just a note, I'm in the service and do not pay an AF for either the CSR or AMEX Platinum.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>On the AMEX/Chase point, I've got ya. I'm in the service though and do not pay AF on either the CSR or AMEX so there was no reason to not have both. Generally I'll just use the AMEX for bookings with an airline or through the portal, and the CSR goes for travel/dining since the CSR has a broader travel category. EDIT: I have also found myself in different locations due to military moves. While I was heavily on the United side (Star Alliance) in Japan, I'm now in GA and Atlanta is home to Delta.</TEXT>

Like, I went home (Florida) for a wedding and used my AMEX to plan and book all the travel and then used my CSR while there. When I went to Canada (Whistler) in March for snowboarding, it was all Chase driven. I booked the hotel through the portal for the 50% bonus on UR.</TEXT>

    <TITLE>Amazon Prime VISA vs Store</TITLE>
    <DATE>2019-10-14 01:56:53</DATE>
    <TEXT>With the shopping I've been doing on Amazon, I started to ask myself why I wasn't getting a consistent 5% back on those purchases yet. I had been offered the Prime VISA a few times already but always shrugged it off. I already have Prime and it seems like a win/win but I am also into Chase's ecosystem pretty hard already. I'm curious if yet another Chase card might impact me later in a way I didn't consider. Hence why I'm asking for some advice on which route to go - Chase Prime VISA or Amazon's Store. I'm not concerned about using this card for other than Amazon as I already have the following: BoA Cash Rewards, CFU, CF, CSR, AMEX Platinum Note: For those who perk up at having the CSR and AMEX Platinum, I have both because I do not currently get charged a yearly fee (Active Duty).

    <TITLE>Next Card Thoughts</TITLE>
    <DATE>2019-10-15 21:52:22</DATE>
    <TEXT>Hey, folks. I had a post not long ago asking about Amazon's Store vs. the Prime VISA but it got me thinking that I might have a better path to take and wanted some advice. Here's my information thus far. As a note, I'm currently Active Duty military and do not pay an AF on my cards. At 13 years in, I'll be in for at least another 7 until retirement. * Current cards: (list cards, limits, opening date) * CFU; CL $18k; MAR '19 * CF; $2k; JUL '11 * CSR; $25.5k; JUN '18 * BoA Cash Rewards; CL $5.5k; SEP '08 (Oldest Line) * AMEX Platinum; CL N/A; APR '18 * FICO Score: *806* * Oldest account age: *11 years 1 mo* * Chase 5/24 status: 3*/24* * Income: *\~$86,000* * Average monthly spend and categories (rough estimates): * dining $300 * groceries: $500 * gas: $300 * travel: $0-200 (varies greatly on if work is paying for the travel or not) * subscriptions: $30 * online: $200 * Open to Business Cards: *No* * What's the purpose of your next card? *Grocery/Online Shopping/Gas benefits* * Do you have any cards you've been looking at? Amazon Store, AMEX BCP, AMEX EP * Are you OK with category spending or do you want a general spending card? Category is fine.  #8203; My spending just reset after a training stint away so they are pretty rough numbers as I just redid my budget. I've got A LOT of hobbies as a single dude with no kids as well. I purchase stuff from Newegg, Amazon, RevZilla, and some other online marketplaces depending on the prices. I snowboard, ride a motorcycle, game (PCMR!), workout, read, etc. My BoA card was acting as my gas card using the 3% category but I thought I could switch it to online and maybe get something better for gas and groceries. Right now, my CFU is used at a local Walmart Market (since it wouldn't code as grocery as far as I know) and I would use my BoA for the 2% at the actual grocery store. With my Chase cards, earning UR is pretty easy. I used to fly United all the time which made sense to be in the Chase sphere. Now, I'm near Atlanta which is a Delta hub so MR just gained importance. I find that my AMEX Platinum just isn't used as the travel protections with the CSR seem better and it's a pain to use the travel credit. Since I never know where I'll live next, I can't give true value to MR or UR for the long term. This is how I currently use my cards: Dining: CSR Travel: CSR/AMEX Plat Everyday: CFU 5% Categories: CF Online: CFU Fuel: BoA Cash Rewards Groceries: BoA Cash Rewards Hotels (if on the portal): AMEX, otherwise CSR Flights (on airline): AMEX, otherwise CSR Really seems like I could be doing better in the online and grocery/gas world. Anyway, I submit myself to people more knowledgeable than me! Any help is GREATLY appreciated. You all rock!</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Really appreciate the insight. It's starting to boil down to if I want to earn MR or cash back directly (BCP vs EP). MR has more flexibility, but it seems the cash back options give higher percentages. I definitely bargain hunt for travel as well which is another reason the AMEX Plat is hard to use. Booking directly with an airline for 5% or their portal for hotels limits bargains. Really, the AMEX Plat is all about the perks and not so much MR building I've noticed.</TEXT>

    <TEXT> gt;Why would you need credit if you were capable of paying everything in full every month? That logic makes no sense. Is this sarcasm? People shouldn't be getting credit cards because they **need** them due to a lack cash. They should be getting them to enhance their perks for travel, cash back, whatever. Paying interest on a credit card means you're living above your income.</TEXT>

    <TITLE>Higher percentage cash back or points at a lower percentage?</TITLE>
    <DATE>2019-11-07 01:57:18</DATE>
    <TEXT>Just curious how people judge which way to go. For instance, if a particular spending type allows 5% cash back or 1.5% points (like the with the CFU), how do you value the two? Does one take precedence over the other? Why? In a way I suppose you could work the math assuming you have a straight 5% card and a CFU/CSR combo (using a $2k spend example): $2000 x .05 = $100 $2000 x .015 = 30pts x 1.5cpp = $45 $2000 x .03 = 60pts x 1.5 cpp = $90 $2000 x .04 = 80pts x 1.5cpp = $120 But this doesn't value the transfer value to a partner that nets 2cpp or more. At 2cpp though, you'd still need a 3pts per dollar to outweigh straight cash back. And further, the individual value people place on miles versus cash. Any other opinions or thoughts? Really curious if people just have a, "If it's over X percentage back for cash back, I go with that over trying to earn more points."</TEXT>

    <TEXT>USAA has a cash back card that gives 5% on gas and on base spending up to $3k per year. It seems like an attractive gas card to me. There's also the Amazon 5% cash back options (Prime and Store) if you already pay for prime. Really this boiled down to the USAA card vice using my CFU and pooling more points from gas purchases. 5% beats 1.5% (right now I use a 3% BoA card anyway), but simple percentages are only a part of the story when it comes to points.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Figures my truck ('18 2500) fell into this issue of alignment. After my steering wheel was almost 90 degrees off, I finally told the dealer to weld it according to the recall "fix". Now, I've got a BDS 2" level and upgraded my track bar (BDS). I still have issues with loose steering in which making left turns puts the steering wheel off center. Usually takes a hard right turn to get it back straight before it slowly goes off center again. I plan to call the dealership to have them work it again, but this is super annoying. Any other folks ran into this recall situation with better results? I saw a post about the Synergy Steering Kit, but I was already planning to move to a 3" BDS lift at some point. Just really annoying overall.</TEXT>

I even saw another aircraft in the distance. "I'm about to jump out of an aircraft." Light went green and that's when I went, "fuck it" and jumped out. I say that it's my biggest since before that, I never did a lot of those things. Since then I've done multiple jumps, fast roped, went through Ranger School, been shot at and all kinds of other craziness. But I still think that was my biggest "fuck it" moment.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>INTJ here and I've been in over 13 years now. Started enlisted, went up to Staff Sergeant and then switch to Warrant Officer. I'm currently a Chief Warrant Officer 2. To say INTJs don't thrive in the military isn't true. The military is a massive organization that has not only different fields but each unit and command climate is different. However, I will say the job you do must be demanding enough intellectually and it isn't always a great experience. The units you go to must provide enough flexibility that you can continue to push yourself. Fields like intelligence and/or special operations can keep you mentally engaged. I honestly love what I do and I would do it again easily. The military has not only pushed me to be more extroverted, but it has also challenged me in ways (physically/emotionally) that I never would have gotten elsewhere. Just my two cents.</TEXT>

I had some fuel charges on my card that was up for autopay, paid it outright, and when the due date came, BoA paid my card again. Places like Chase have systems smart enough to know if you already pay, autopay isn #8217;t needed anymore. Evidently BoA #8217;s systems are not that smart.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I'm just looking to vent a bit and ask about Synergy parts, but this situation is extremely annoying and given how much we love these trucks, we're getting the short end. For reference: [https://static.nhtsa.gov/odi/rcl/2019/RCRIT-19V021-2187.pdf](https://static.nhtsa.gov/odi/rcl/2019/RCRIT-19V021-2187.pdf) I finally let the local dealership here weld the nut after my steering wheel was almost 45 degrees off. But with it welded now, alignment shops can't/won't touch it. Most of them give me a "WTF?" when I mention this was the "fix" for the recall. Simply going in for an alignment or getting it done with other work is now a complete PITA. I'm about to replace the drag link with a Synergy one. Anyone have some input regarding these or have used them before? I'm considering moving from a level to an actual suspension lift in the future, and it \*seems\* like I won't be replacing the drag link again with a suspension lift from somewhere like BDS/Carli/etc. So if I do it now, the $300 to fix the manufacturer's screw up should be well spent. Right?</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Hey! Long time PC gamer with a custom machine who's looking to build additional gamer contacts. I'm hilarious (I think so), friendly, open to gaming with anyone and I'm also heavily into tech (InfoSec major). People I game with generally turn into friendships even outside of gaming, so I should mention other things I'm into for hobbies - almost everything. I'm not kidding. Mostly it is snowboarding, motorcycles, tattoos, cars/trucks, guns, reading, fitness (gymrats unite!), anime, and SCUBA diving. MBTI type? INTJ. I also volunteer at the local humane society because animals are cool. Current Games: Apex Legends, COD MW, 7 Days to Die, Dead by Daylight, and Fornite I used to play EverQuest, WoW and I'm waiting on a new MMO to get back into those types of games. Usually games with some sort of SciFi or Fantasy element perk my interest immediately, and I'm STOKED for Cyberpunk 2077 (Yes, I played Witcher 3). Now, here's the catch - I'm an officer in the military (Army). Long time career guy here so there are times where I'm not able to game (deployments). It's a fact of my life. It's led to having some amazing experiences though. If that's all ok with you or you've got questions, feel free to message me!</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Hey, folks! Just looking for some opinions. Debadged the Cummins emblem on my  #8216;18 Ram 2500. The other side is perfectly clean. The right side, had this discoloration with a bumpy feel under the logo. Not sure what it is. It wasn #8217;t under the entire logo, it #8217;s rough to the touch, and the color is whitish. Any ideas? EDIT: Another view - https://ibb.co/GVBQYGz</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Yea, it #8217;s the light colored spot in the middle. The back of the badge had a double-sided adhesive that was black; it all came off. I used the same remover as the other side. So, I don #8217;t think it is leftover residue.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Red overspray on the flare? Little background. These flares are aftermarket and were LINEX sprayed before going on. The smaller flares were removed, and these were bolted on. The flare itself pushed against the emblem, sliding it off the adhesive which is why I just debadged. The adhesive itself came off extremely easy after heating. Literally just peeled right off with little left on. The other side had a lot of water that came running out when I began to remove it. So these emblems must have been holding some water beneath them.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>As far as I know, it hasn #8217;t been painted after factory. I bought the truck brand new. When I got the adhesive off, this was the only spot that had a weird look and bumpy feel (under the C in the emblem). At first, I thought it was more adhesive so I went over the area multiple times with 3M adhesive remover (same stuff used elsewhere). After that didn #8217;t work, nothing. I didn #8217;t want to make the problem worse.</TEXT>

    <TEXT> gt; Almost like the Cummins badge was put on too early and the paint gassed off in this specific area under the tape causing the little  #8220;bubbles #8221; and discolouration in the clear in that area... This is what I was thinking too based on reading and limited knowledge. I did at least call today to ask about warranty stuff. They would have to look at it, send the info and pics to FCA for approval, and then send it to a body shop. Since the truck is under 36,000mi/3yr, I'm hoping it will be covered if it needs to be repainted.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>There #8217;s always a time in someone #8217;s life where they need some tough love. There #8217;s not a person you #8217;ll meet that hasn #8217;t had something in their life they either refused to see or failed to admit. You #8217;ve taken the first step in coming here for help, but the tough love part comes in actually making a change. Simply coming here and asking for help won #8217;t solve your long term problems. This won #8217;t be easy. You #8217;re not going to enjoy it. You #8217;ll sacrifice. But after those things, you #8217;ll be better for it in the long run. Leases can be broken. Your pet can find a new home (temporarily or permanently). If you actually want to have a stable life, you #8217;re going to have to be the one to do it. That means telling friends no when they want you to go out, finding a roommate or moving, and refusing to have the nicest things. Look, as others have said, you need a budget and to cut your spending (or raise your income). There #8217;s no magic trick to it. While there are some tips in refinancing or talking with creditors, what you really need is a bump on the head to be a responsible adult. Had you been more responsible, a BF leaving you wouldn #8217;t be such a detriment. With all that said, I #8217;m sorry to hear about the relationship and I wish you the best of luck. I can promise you that once you suck it up for a time and act like you #8217;re poor (because with that debt, you are), the freedom that comes with money in the bank for emergencies, good credit, and saving opportunities can #8217;t be ignored. The situation you #8217;re in isn #8217;t hopeless but requires real change by you. Good luck.</TEXT>

I use running to work out situations in my head that require thinking time away from distractions. Pace. Pacing is the big catch if you're able to kill a 1 mile time but have issues running distance. You've got to slow down for that first mile (use a watch) and work to maintain that pace. There are time I will go on long runs at a pretty slow speed and just work on pace management.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Part of this is being grown up about it. It's a natural function in a woman's body. As a dude, if things start to lean towards the physical on a date, I definitely appreciate her letting me know. I don't think you need to do a pre-date text of, "Oh, just so you know..." unless sex is pretty much ALWAYS what happens when you're together. So, I guess it really depends. If the times you meet always end up with some sort of physical ending, I think it'd be fine to just let the dude know. Plus, if he suddenly has no interest in hanging with you, welp, you get the drift.</TEXT>

    <TEXT> gt;WTF kind of logic is that? "You didn't open it before returning it, so of they got back an **empty box because that's what they sent**, it's your fault they sent an empty box!" You're assuming they sent an empty box. Neither you, nor OP, nor anyone here knows that - **because OP didn't open the box.** So your "ass backwards" logic piece is pretty flawed. Had OP opened it, seen it was empty, and then notified Amazon, I would agree with you in that it would be Amazon's fault.  gt;but then if I gpt something that should be substantial, and I get the package and it weighs like nothing, I might also just shrug, figure it's total crap or a knockoff (both quite common on Amazon) and return it without wasting more time investigating further. Wait, what? Investigating further by opening the box? Opening the box is THAT much more effort? If you would do this, you would also be shipping something back without actually knowing what you're sending. Hell, could have been a $10,000 ring and you would have just shipped it back (not that I would be for keeping something wrongfully sent, even in that case - just making the point).  gt;If it feels like a POS because they sent an empty box, which I never opened, please outline the mental gymnastics required to make that the buyer's fault. Another **assumption** in the box being empty. Here's why the "mental gymnastics" is just common sense. Once a package is in your possession, it is up to you to ensure you A) received the right thing and B) it isn't broken/damaged. It takes opening the box to do those things.  gt;got a taped up package, with 2 obviously used  amp; burnt out bulbs that not only didn't match the package brand, they were 2 different brands So, what you're saying is....you opened the package, realized they sent you faulty stuff, and I'm assuming, made them take responsibility for it? Wow. Imagine that. Pretty sure that's how it is supposed to work. Look, I don't disagree that Amazon and its sellers should be better about what they send out. I've gotten products mislabeled before that were incorrect. I've also gotten faulty stuff. But in all of those times, I went to verify what was sent to me. I have never, ever had an issue with Amazon correcting the problem by either a refund or sending me the right item. It's not just about Amazon being better, but being a logical adult and protecting yourself. You. Always. Verify. What. Was. Sent. To. You. Plus, completely outside of Amazon, it is YOUR responsibility to know what you are shipping. Period. As soon as it comes from your residence in either USPS, FEDEX, UPS, whatever....you are accountable for that item.</TEXT>

Amazon doesn't have special tape, and there's no way they know exactly what a package looks like for the millions of stuff they send out daily (plus OP said it was a third party seller if I remember right). And once again, **you're assuming Amazon screwed up** by stating "Amazon doesn't have their shit together". **Since OP never opened it, the product COULD have been in the box** \- just like what was ordered. We can go back and forth until the end of time, you clearly have a very different viewpoint on who's fault this is and once again, I'll state that it is OP's for misrepresenting the return reason, and not verifying if it was even in the box to begin with.</TEXT>

With the $1K leftover, toss that into a HYSA for any emergencies, then focus on the $441 and $975 with your normal income after the move, snowballing those with a focus on $441 first. That plan would take care of the majority of debt, give you a bit of a safety net, and leave a relatively small amount with the highest APR.</TEXT>

If they can funnel you to "package" purchases, it nets them a larger business share than just a flight alone. I'm not sure why they don't have those bundles. Maybe it was a part of the agreement between Expedia and Chase?

    <TEXT>I #8217;m in the service as well, and also contribute to TSP while maintaining an IRA. TSP is definitely a great tool because of the lower expenses, but fund options are also limited. I would agree that whatever you toss in it, you just leave in it under most circumstances.</TEXT>

I got another 6 and I  #8220;retire #8221; with a military pension so I plan to just let what #8217;s in my TSP grow. With my follow on job after service, I #8217;ll keep putting money in my IRA.

    <TEXT>chat? Look, I'm not super special and I'm not depressed or lonely. But, I do like making new meaningful friendships and I've been very fortunate to have made some via Reddit (though not here yet). Figured I would toss out a post here and see what happens. I'm very open and honest, and as we chat, you'll also realize I'm a pretty open book about who I am and my thoughts and opinions. I'm pretty chill to be frank. If you're into any of the MBTI stuff, I'm an INTJ. I have a bunch of hobbies and a crazy amount of curiosity in just about everything. I snowboard, SCUBA dive, ride a motorcycle, off-road, build gaming PCs, game, watch anime and I'm a big fitness guy (run and lift). A friend of mine once told me I was confusing because I'm "cool" but also a major dork. I'd like to think I'm pretty genuine though - Picard is the best Captain. Because I'm into so much, I can generally get along with anyone or fit in anywhere. I've lived out of the U.S., I travel, and I'm the kind of guy that makes a special trip just to visit an observatory. That being said, I don't think I'll "click" with everyone or everyone with me; and that's cool. If nothing else, I can definitely offer advice or a friendly ear if you need it. I can also rock out some good puns. If we don't mesh or the chat fades, I won't leave you hanging at least and seriously, no hard feelings at all. If you've gotten THIS far, feel free to hit me up - male or female. If you're a dude, we can bro out and talk guns/cars/trucks/gaming/whatever. If you're female, we can do the same if you're into all that. And no, you won't get a nude photo or anything weird from me. I have plenty of female friends and a little sister, I get the frustration. So yea, if you're interesting hit me up! We can see how it goes.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>It's ridiculous to me too. This guy isn't a shooting instructor at all either. He's just been buying ammo for 10 years or so, monthly, and continues to do so. He even inventories it.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I had a work trip to Hawaii with someone else who was a certified diver. At the time, I was pretty afraid of water I couldn #8217;t touch the bottom in due to close call drowning incidents as a kid. I made a decision I was tired of being limited by it so started putting time in a local pool to learn and then went to certify. Definitely glad I did because it #8217;s been one of the coolest things I #8217;ve done and the interactions with wildlife are amazing.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>This would never happen, but I #8217;d assume if PCMR and the computer gamers of the world just say  #8220;nope #8221; and refused to buy any 3080/3070/3090 for the next year, you #8217;d have all these scalpers stuck with cards they can #8217;t use with no idea when they could sell. Guy that bought 40 3080s would be sitting on 30k worth of cards for a year or more for instance. I can just imagine that maybe, just maybe, the scalpers would realize the community as whole can just give them the finger and not play the game. But nope. Gotta buy the latest and greatest. Even if it costs more than it should. Even if it stresses you out. (From someone who #8217;s still sitting on his 1080 and will continue to do so.) I thought the obsessed Apple fans were crazy sleeping outside of stores for a new phone, this is literally no different. Folks, it #8217;s a GPU. It #8217;s not worth your mental health or real life time to fight for a piece of hardware. When we #8217;re all laying on our deathbeds, no one is going to look back and still be honestly pissed about not having a 3080. Nvidia doesn #8217;t care about you. The scalpers don #8217;t care about you. Do yourself a favor and just go game (even if it #8217;s on an older card). -A concerned older gamer</TEXT>

    <TEXT>At least you went and took a hard look and saw what it #8217;s all about - gaming. I never try and rely on a purchase during a major release like this because of the straight up ridiculousness. I #8217;ll pick up something eventually. I planned on being ready to go before Cyberpunk released but I can still play it with my current setup. So what if it #8217;s not max settings? It doesn #8217;t change the gameplay and it saves me the headache.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>That #8217;s fair but let #8217;s not confuse being an enthusiast for being obsessive/psychotic. Sure, all of us here get into PCs. The RGB, crazy over clocks, top of the line components = enthusiast. But when your literal health gets involved, like people staying awake all the time to F5 a page, or sleeping in front of a store to be #20 in line for a fucking card happens, you #8217;re not an enthusiast anymore. People are legit letting this card consume their mental state.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>That laminate is the outer shell (what they paint). On the inside of that is a foam liner (usually of polystyrene) and then next should be the actual padding on your head. Edit: Unless there #8217;s some crazy helmets out there. But that 3 layer system is what the Motorcycle Safety Foundation trains and I #8217;ve seen it with my Shoei helmets.</TEXT>

    <TITLE>Credit Card Points - The Full Picture</TITLE>
    <DATE>2020-10-19 10:33:59</DATE>
    <TEXT>I'm not sure about the rest of you, but I use YNAB to track my entire financial picture (as much as I can anyway). That means, when I get cash back from a CC, I add the transaction as a TBB/income (memo as credit) in order to get an idea how much money I make off using my CCs (all cards PIF). Where the situation gets weird is when it's not actually statement credit but purchases outright with points that I'm curious about. A perfect example is this next week I have a rather long trip to do and I have a hotel booked entirely in points. So technically, it's not my money I spent but I still "spent it". Do you all track any of that and if so, how do you do it? My first thought is to record the transaction like I paid with a CC and then just credit back the dollar value of the spent points. I'm not even going to get into airline partner transfers because I haven't had near enough coffee yet.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>No, they're not money but as soon as you convert them, they are (whether statement credit or booking a room). The comparison comment was a bit of unsolicited advice by the way. I didn't ask for it because I already do what you stated (plus all my cards are non-AF).</TEXT>
