    <TEXT>So I have options for my first serious AEG. The first is ECHO1's Modular tactical carbine 2 (http://www.airsoftgi.com/product_info.php?products_id=9433) The second is Airsoft GI's G4-A3 (http://www.airsoftgi.com/product_info.php?products_id=6438) Both seem to have very solid reputations, and they will end up costing the same because for the G4-A3 I will have to buy a battery and charger. The only substantial differences are this: - Option 1 (MTC2) fires at 350 fps whereas Option 2 (G4-A3) fires at 305 (but it comes with an m100 spring so that can be fixed with an m120) - Option 1 has 2 mags included, whereas Option 2 only has 1. - Option 1 reportedly has shitty iron sights, and I won't be able to shell out for a red dot for another 2-3 months. Help is much appreciated. EDIT: I play on a field</TEXT>

    <TITLE>Question about barrel extensions</TITLE>
    <DATE>2012-10-21 12:55:36</DATE>
    <TEXT>If I put a barrel extension that reaches longer than the inner barrel, will it affect my shots? Example: To upgrade a CQB M4 to carbine length, you need an inner barrel that is 100mm longer (265mm to 365mm) which amounts to a shade under 4 inches (3.94). I have a supressor that is 6 inches long. Will the extra space between the end of the inner barrel and the end of the extension affect the airflow around my bbs and thus affect their flight? Any help is much appreciated</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Upgrading the motor is a good idea, although it is a bit pricey. With what you've got you'll want to start working on compression. That means cylinder, cylinder head, O-ring, and the like. Although to be fair CMs have fairly good compression stock. Also if you perform any upgrades that increase RPM (LiPo or motor) you'll want to get a ball bearing spring guide.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>You are correct in that statement. But the upgrades I'm thinking of don't really put extra stress. I was thinking of working on compression. So cylinder, cylinder head, o-rings, and the like. I should have been clearer though. This gun is still not recommended at this price range though. Only if you are REALLY set on getting a TAR should this be an option. (Like in an IDF loadout)</TEXT>

    <TITLE>My Build is Having Issues</TITLE>
    <DATE>2013-11-11 18:21:17</DATE>
    <TEXT>Back in April I completed my first build successfully, and I have been really happy with it so far. Recently however, the entire computer would freeze up, and require a manual shutdown to come out of it. I've been troubleshooting this for about a month or so, and yesterday the problem escalated. The PC froze as usual, but when I restarted it there was no beep from the motherboard for a good 5 minutes, when the silence was broken by a 15 second or so long beep, and it finally went into boot. I proceeded to look in the logs for any signs as to why when for the first time there was a Blue Screen of Death, and when I tried to restart it 10 minutes later it powered itself of before making it to boot. 3 hours later it did make it into windows again, but the BSOD struck again, and I haven't touched the PC since. **I think the problem lies in the power supply but I'm not sure**. Has anyone had any similar issues? **Part list for those interested:** Type|Item|Price :----|:----|:---- **CPU** | [Intel Core i5-3470 3.2GHz Quad-Core Processor](http://pcpartpicker.com/part/intel-cpu-bx80637i53470) | $187.98 @ SuperBiiz **Motherboard** | [Gigabyte GA-H77-DS3H ATX LGA1155 Motherboard](http://pcpartpicker.com/part/gigabyte-motherboard-gah77ds3h) | $95.97 @ OutletPC **Memory** | [Corsair Vengeance 8GB (2 x 4GB) DDR3-1600 Memory](http://pcpartpicker.com/part/corsair-memory-cmz8gx3m2a1600c9b) | $79.99 @ Amazon **Storage** | [Western Digital Caviar Blue 500GB 3.5" 7200RPM Internal Hard Drive](http://pcpartpicker.com/part/western-digital-internal-hard-drive-wd5000aakx) | $54.99 @ NCIX US **Video Card** | [Zotac GeForce GTX 660 Ti 2GB Video Card](http://pcpartpicker.com/part/zotac-video-card-zt6080410p) | $284.99 @ SuperBiiz **Wired Network Adapter** | [Rosewill RC-400-LX 10/100/1000 Mbps PCI Network Adapter](http://pcpartpicker.com/part/rosewill-wired-network-card-rc400lx) | $11.99 @ Newegg **Power Supply** | [Antec Basiq Plus 550W 80 PLUS Certified ATX12V Power Supply](http://pcpartpicker.com/part/antec-power-supply-bp550plus) | $64.97 @ OutletPC | | **Total** | Prices include shipping, taxes, and discounts when available. | $780.88 | Generated by PCPartPicker 2013-11-11 13:10 EST-0500 | **EDIT/UPDATE:** I have just managed to find the beep code list for Gigabyte motherboards, and it confirms that one continuous long beep==power supply failure.

    <TEXT>The Declaration of Independence's sole purpose was to be as enduring as possible. It is made using vague language on many topics and designed to be applicable even in the face of 200 years of technological advancement. It is nowhere near the same case here, an agreement that suited both parties **while fighting a 3 front war.** The government needed all the support it could get at the time. In addition, the very essence of a democracy is that the majority decides what happens to **everyone.** If you don't like what the majority decides, then there are systems in place to debate these rulings and use rational discussion. I'm pretty sure blocking the road of a major city (and thus other functions such as emergency services and the economy, remember what just happened in New Jersey?) does not count as "rational discussion".</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Not really. If you're reading this you probably live in a developed nation, and nearly all developed nations have a fertility rate that is under 2 (less than 2 kids per set of parents mean they aren't replacing themselves) meanwhile in undeveloped nations fertility goes between 2.5 and 6. By not having kids in a developed country you are effectively reducing the amount of people that have money to fund the development of poorer countries that are growing and need more capital to survive. I'm not saying not having kids is bad or anything like that, just pointing out that the notion that doing so gives back to the world is false.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>You can not be serious. Directly under what you linked (which are all quotes from people whose political standing would be hurt if they said otherwise) is a section supporting exactly the opposite. Regardless of whether you think that section is valid, it is there and Wikipedia's editors have deemed it worthy information to have (just like what you pointed to I will confess). And really, if you wouldn't call someone that in a public place, don't think that hiding behind your computer makes it much different for the person on the other side (surprise surprise, calling someone an uneducated dolt is name calling). It can't be that difficult to just not call people names, and it certainly didn't advance your point to do so (twice now).</TEXT>

It's similar to the NSA surveillance issue in this regard. The lack of a requirement for evidence (or lowering the bar) allows anyone in a position of power to claim something about you, or twist facts to reflect badly, and that would justify their actions without question. But you still never would have had the chance to defend yourself (in a formal way, not by force)</TEXT>

    <TEXT>The reason they aren't giving up the west bank is largely strategic. If they were to do that certain portions of the country would be only ~~50~~ **9** miles wide and it would effectively split the country in two. Israel also historically has not had much success when it comes to land for peace, all it takes is one look at Gaza to see that. The real kicker though is that Hamas now has power in the West Bank along with Fatah, and they have publicly said they will not accept any peace agreement as long as Israel still exists. I'm not saying anything about whether what Israel does in the West Bank is right or wrong, but to the Israeli government giving it up has absolutely nothing good in store for them. Israel isn't going to go away anytime soon though. Even without US dollars Israel is a very economically viable country that has done nothing but prosper economically, and it has a very successful tech sector along with an advanced military very capable of defending itself.

    <TEXT>So what solution are you looking for here? If Israel completely abandons the West Bank it essentially cuts the North off from the South and creates a massive military problem. In addition Hamas has stated they will not accept any peace terms, and if Israel pulls out and an attack happens they won't be politically allowed to retaliate because that makes them "oppressors" again. Israel has nothing to gain from leaving the West Bank, when the PA can guarantee peace (maybe start by controlling its own people) and be willing to even negotiate then something might happen.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Please refer to Hamas' manifesto before continuing to say they accept the '67 borders: http://edition.cnn.com/2012/11/16/world/meast/hamas-explainer/  gt; The goal of Hamas is an Islamic fundamentalist Palestinian state. Its manifesto advocates the destruction of the state of Israel, and calls for the raising of "the banner of Allah over every inch of Palestine." In addition, while the article does claim Hamas will accept '67 borders, it also mentions they will not acknowledge Israel's right to exist. To Israel, that is basically asking to push back the armistice line, because in the end they will go back to "the destruction is the state of Israel" again.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Hamas claims exactly the same thing regarding Palestine in regards to religious purpose. If you are going to go after Israel for being religiously biased Hama's is the wrong group to root for. In addition, Israel's case makes it necessary for right to exist to be declared, it has already been declared formally (not simply de facto) by other Arab nations in peace treaties. Now we have to acknowledge that you don't think Israel should exist. Okay then, what to do now? On the one hand, you can tell all the Jews living there they are now part of the single Palestinian state, ruled jointly by Hamas and Fatah, both of which are just as, if not more, religiously biased than Israel. On the other hand, you can force all the Jews to leave, but that might sound a bit too familiar to you. What I'm trying to say is that claiming he said she said doesn't forward the peace process anywhere, neither does not acknowledging the existence of a nation with millions of people. To get anything done offer real solutions, the two-state solution is definitely a possible one, but judging by your comment you don't seem to want Israel there at all. Edit: I also want to add that Israel does indeed recognize the non-Jewish portions of its population. The only difference between Jews and non-Jews in Israel are the laws for immigrating. Claiming otherwise is simply false.</TEXT>

To those in China, India, the UK and EU, or any other country, it would be fair to say that Obama is the "face" of America. He represents American interests, beliefs, and policy. To those in China, India, the UK and EU, or any other country, it would be fair to say that Hamas is the "face" of Gaza. They represent Gazan interests, beliefs, and policy. So one possibility is that the people of Gaza are supportive of Hamas' practices (because they were elected by Gazan civilians after all), which to be honest are less than morally upright, regardless of Israeli actions. The alternative is that they do not support Hamas (as seen through their refusal to hold any elections since 2007), and therefore live under a terrorist regime without the approval of the general populace. I'm not making any comment about Israel or their actions. But based on what I have said it's pretty clear that Hamas is not the ideal political party/movement/terrorist group/whatever you want to call them to lead the Palestinian people to better future.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I am referring to what the majority of those *outside* the country of your choosing feel and perceive. If I were to go to France and say "pick one actual person who you think most represents America and its interests", I'm fairly certain the majority would choose the elected President of that country. For the US, it was Bush in 2003, FDR in 1933 and Obama now. Obviously no leader has a perfect approval rating and will never be perfectly representative of their country. And you would be surprised. Take a look around this thread, there are quite a few people who think it's OK that Hamas sends rockets into Israel. After that, you can head over to /r/conspiracy and find more than 240,000 more. *I'm not saying this makes it okay to kill civilians.* I will, however, say that if Israel's goal is to hinder Hamas greatly, they are succeeding in that goal. Obviously there are methods that could be taken to avoid civilian casualties, but to say that it is possible to avoid them entirely is ludicrous.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>First of all, no, I absolutely mean a lack of deflection. As in no deflection at all, because there's still no real response to what I said in the first place. Second, when taking responsibility for rocket attacks Hamas states where they aim the rockets, and it has never been towards a military base. If you feel that the people of Gaza are oppressed, they would probably be better off doing the following things: 1) NOT starting a conflict they cannot win (they did in fact start it, if they hadn't fired rockets there would be no operation right now), thus putting the civilian population of their country in danger, because if Israel is such a devious and devilish country they should be expecting an attack on civilians. Granted I don't agree with a couple of the points here, such as Hamas aggression being fully justified, but I am trying to follow the pro-Hamas rhetoric (not pro-Palestinian, Hamas is an embarrassment to the people of Palestine). 2) If they are going to start a war, it might just be a good idea to aim for the bases where the planes that strike their cities are based, and not civilian areas that not only give Israel more reasons to justify an operation on the international stage but also have little effect as they all get shot down. In conclusion, I understand that the people of Palestine feel that they are oppressed, but anyone who thinks that Hamas is getting anything done from a tactical and political perspective is misguided. There are much better people, parties, and ideologies that have much more potential to bring peace to the region.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>You are absolutely right that the people of Gaza should not be held responsible for their governments actions (to a point, they were still democratically elected), but for the most part Israeli targets holds a least a little bit if military/strategic value. They are pretty much sick of Hamas and anything that helps get rid of them is a worthy target (in their eyes). If Hamas did not gain anything from dead civilians, *they wouldn't have started/escalated this conflict because they have nothing to gain.* Therefore there's only one logical conclusion.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>His post history is irrelevant, bringing it up only serves to invalidate your own point. If you had confidence in what you said you wouldn't have felt the need to add that edit. Also, quit acting like Hamas' rockets are "occasional." On average during this conflict there has been at least one every couple hours or less. There's something you need to realize though, and that's Israel's ethical dilemma. It is pretty much accepted fact that Hamas fires rockets from built up civilian areas, with civilians in them. This is mainly to try and dissuade Israel from attacking that rocket site. So what do you think happens the moment Israel calls off a strike in a civilian area? All the rockets suddenly start coming from populated areas instead of only some of them. So Israel decides to bomb those locations and try to send the message that Hamas fighters are not safe anywhere. Next, Hamas tries to launch from areas that are a bit more politically sacred, such as mosques, community centers, etc. Once again Israel is faced with the same issue, so they bomb those sites as well, otherwise rockets would never stop and Israel would spend eternity using $10,000/shot missile systems to repel rockets that cost ~$800 to produce. Hamas escalates even further, firing from right next to schools, hospitals, and places under UN jurisdiction. And Israel continues its policy. The objective of the operation in Gaza was to bring a permanent quiet to the Israeli people. That means they have to send a clear message to Hamas: "None of you are safe, no matter where you are." You may disagree from an ethical standpoint, but the idea does hold water, and from a military perspective it's the only option.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>And you are trusting the intelligence of a widely accepted terrorist organization that has been proven to lie about its casualty figures, particularly the civilian to fighter death ratios. The Dahiya Doctrine is significantly less relevant in this conflict, and that's because foreign journalists have thoroughly documented (though not publicized until very recently because Hamas prohibits it) the use of civilian infrastructure as military sites. And I want to add something else to this. Doesn't Hamas also target civilians intentionally? I have yet to hear about a missile aimed at Hatzerim for example (an airbase in the Negev). I only hear about missiles aimed at towns and clearly civilian areas. Does that mean Hamas is guilty of attempting genocide? And if so, why is no one saying anything about that? Why were so many rockets launched at civilian areas that Israel felt the need to spend billions of dollars to design a system to defend from them, but Israel is the one guilty of targeting civilians?</TEXT>

    <TEXT>1. The tunnels that transfer food and other such supplies were not destroyed in this conflict, they physically could not have been. Israel's ground incursion entered a few miles into the strip from the Israeli border, and all the tunnels that go into Israel are offensive. The ones that give aid actually come from Egypt, and it is Egypt that destroys those tunnels because they also transport weapons through them. 2. Strategically they have the option of not deliberately targeting civilians in the same way that they complain Israel targets them. Trying to target military bases and the like (which in Israel are clearly NOT in civilian areas) might be more effective and earn them a better position on the international stage, I wonder why they don't try that? 3. Other countries criticizing Israel is irrelevant to the conflict. They have the same data as everyone else does and among the civilian population the opinion is rather divided. And anyway no new countries are banning imports of any of Israel's non-military products. 4. Israel left the Gaza Strip in 2005, you are essentially suggesting that Israel left with the intention of taking it back, and given all the infrastructure Israel left for Palestinians in the Strip when they left, and I doubt that's the case. Among Israelis the leaving of Gaza was a very unpopular decision to begin with.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Actually, Hamas backed the kidnapping, according to recent Israeli findings (A Hamas high up said they paid the kidnappers while being interrogated). And I can promise you that the Israeli gov't is not hell-bent on killing as many Palestinians as possible, they have nothing to gain from that. Now you're thinking in the right way! If Hamas is doing bad things for Gaza, then a good step to helping the people of Gaza is to get rid of Hamas. Instead though, people are too busy justifying Hamas' attacks as resistance and Israeli attacks as war crimes or genocide which is thrown around way too loosely in this case. In reality, I don't think either of those assumptions has clear cut merit, although you're free to disagree. I'm not justifying the killing of innocent civilians. These threads tend to go really crazy without anyone considering the point of view of the Israeli people and government. They can either show that no Hamas operative is safe no matter where the rockets are fired from, or they can give backhanded permission for them to fire from politically sacred civilian structures such as mosques, schools, hospitals etc. The Israeli gov't is facing a big problem here, and on the PR side there's no way they can win. They chose a path that they thought would bring peace quickly in the short term and would make it clear to Hamas that their tactics aren't effective. One could make the argument that their decision was unethical, but the same can go the other way around if it forces the Israeli people to live under constant threat, spending ludicrous amounts of money on the Iron Dome, all while losing support for not doing something about the people causing the problem.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>So all those were claimed by the Israeli government to either be mistakes or to have been legitimate military targets. Whether or not you believe that is irrelevant, but if you follow up on your own links you'll find that Israel never says, "Yep, targeted civilians today no big deal". The only exception is in the last link, where the Human Rights Watch says it conducted an investigation when in fact it basically just asked Hamas for their opinion on what happened. There was no actual reporting in that story, only hearsay. If you want to charge war crimes based on that, fine, but I don't think many will agree with you. One more thing to note is that the Dahiya Doctrine is irrelevant to the Israeli military in this war. Normally it is used when military and civilian infrastructure can be effectively differentiated. Hamas has, of course, made this very difficult, so now instead of specifically attacking civilian infrastructure the plan is to kill Hamas fighters no matter where they are. If you feel like more links would make your point stronger, you could try doing that. But until you have 6000 indisputable pieces of evidence there will always be more evidence for Hamas' war crimes, if only because Hamas has admitted to them.</TEXT>

    <TITLE>Sirens (A slam poem)</TITLE>
    <DATE>2014-08-19 19:13:59</DATE>
    <TEXT>Thousands wake up in the dead of night To the sounds of the Siren #8217;s wail. I open my eyes, realizing this one was different From the Siren I succumbed to not long ago My legs find new strength as I leap downstairs And finally find solace behind a thick iron door I am alone, and as the wail becomes muffled I feel Trapped in my consciousness, wishing I could be comatose once more. Thoughts assault me mercilessly like the rockets I hide from But I have no Iron Dome to shoot them down. I have no defense from that fateful missile:  #8220;I kissed him only physically #8221; Because I don #8217;t think a physical kiss truly exists, Like a Qassam #8217;s kiss with the sky Your kiss is not just physical It is a statement, something grown together, out of belief, out of passion, out of the way you think of us together Is nothing sacred anymore? Be it an UNRWA school, a child raised in bigotry, or our kiss Where is the line for those beautiful moments reserved just for us? I know you don #8217;t mean to But between you and Hamas, I know who is more effective in annihilating me The siren outside has faded now, and everyone tries to sleep But in my mind #8217;s eye the Siren wails eternal Reminds me that before that kiss was such a beautiful person Who made me feel more complete Than any prayer ever could Unlike Odysseus, however, There is no one to tie me down, Nor is there wax in my ears Lest I miss the Siren that saved my life tonight In the face of one that could destroy me anyway.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>This is an opinion piece. A lot of the buzzwords the author uses in the article can be debated. The first one is that everyone bought in to the "no partner lie". That one is blatantly untrue. It was actually a "No partner in Arafat (who took billions in aid for himself and has walked away from several deals that were revolutionary to the Palestinians) or the PLO". Being a well respected journalist doesn't make one's completely subjective assertions more true, they are subject to the same criticism.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>You are essentially saying that Israelis deserve to live under these conditions, thus advocating the collective punishment I'm fairly certain you also decry when it goes the other way around. Just because Gaza lives under bad conditions doesn't mean that Israel is obligated to accept their conditions as well. In fact, when Israel decides it has enough of those conditions it attacks military targets (that are all based in civilian areas). When Hamas decides it wants to end it's conditions it fires on places that offer no strategic benefit at all. I wonder why they would do that? If a city in Gaza is a pile of rubble, it is because every flattened building either held a high ranking fighter or a rocket platform/cache. The fact that these normally perfectly accepted military targets are now based in civilian buildings doesn't matter to Israel anymore, they will do whatever it takes for the rockets to stop.</TEXT>

Never mind the fact that no laws would get passed if there were to be a parliamentary system and economic agreements would be near impossible. All this together and it's basically another Czechoslovakia in the making. A slightly more reasonable approach that might be more accepted would be if the West Bank, along borders that are NOT the '67 ones, was absorbed by their most culturally similar nation and neighbor, Jordan. This idea of course has many issues as well (other Arabs discriminate against Palestinians, Jordan doesn't want them, political and economic upheaval because of the sheer amount of people, etc.) But at least the assimilating peoples would be more compatible, and you still get your equal rights.</TEXT>

They can become, and are, doctors, members of the Knesset, University professors even in classes to do with the conflict, and military generals. The exclusion of people in the West Bank is a moot point as well, 90% of Israelis don't consider it part of Israel, and everyone would like it to be completely separated sometime in the hopefully near future, so it doesn't make sense to let them vote on issues that only would affect them in the short term, or take a job in what might soon be a different country.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Just realize the numbers you provided are sourced from Hamas, people who have already been proven to fudge their numbers during Operation Cast Lead. In that case the final numbers had a total death count that amounted to 65-70% of what they had claimed, with **50% being active Hamas operatives**, a shockingly good rate of civilian casualties for a conflict of this nature, never mind that 70% less children were killed than they claimed. And similarly to Obama, Netanyahu was elected under a platform that is substantially different from the way he exercises his power in office now. What I'm trying to say with all this is that a black-and-white view such as yours (and its opposite originating from Jewish extremists) is **exactly** what fuels this conflict, and you are promoting hate more than you are tolerance. I don't think calling Israelis baby-killing racists is going to help bring peace anytime soon, and peace is really what most people in Israel, Gaza, and the West Bank want. View like yours are what gives the crazies a voice as well as the disproportionate amount of power that has led to so many unnecessary deaths on either side.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Mahane Yehuda is the central informal market, or shuk, in Jerusalem. Very often a woman well into her 40s/50s would come to the stand where I worked and say just about that exact statement. Translated, it means more or less "Young man (term of endearment), hummus, French fries, (Israeli) salad, GO!" It's an order for what she wants in her pita with falafel.</TEXT>

    <TITLE>How To Best Help My Girlfriend Enjoy Counter Strike</TITLE>
    <DATE>2015-01-06 18:25:30</DATE>
    <TEXT>Hi all, my girlfriend is almost completely new to gaming, but was interested in it, so for a her birthday a couple weeks ago I picked up a few games, one of them being GO, which interested her the most by far. So far we have a played a few matches with bots just trying to get her familiar with using WASD and very basic aiming, but I know at some point she's going to want to try MM or a PUG service, and I'm not sure how to handle this. Everyone here knows that CS for women is absolute hell if you use your mic, and I don't think you can enjoy the game as much if you aren't using one. I'm also afraid that the rather low standard of treatment might very quickly turn her off the gaming scene. Of course I could join her and play white knight or whatever, but she will want to play alone at some point too. As of now the only solution I can think of is if she queues with me and some friends of mine who I trust. Is that the only solution? Any women on here willing to divulge how they deal with this sort of thing? Any help is much appreciated.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I don't really think my exact hours are relevant, but as I said they're rather close to the average, as are the hours played of people I queue with. I also don't see how what you're saying affects this chart. It's an average, and while of course everyone has a personal skill ceiling its pretty obvious that the more you play the better you'll be at the game.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Not necessarily. A self defense firearm will often be loaded, but not have a round chambered, so that before you fire you would need to chamber a round. That way, there's a quick and simple action to perform when you need it, that also requires enough force that it can't happen by accident. To add to that, most firearms have a safety that any sane person would leave on. Safeties are either buttons, a switch/dial, or on a pistol embedded into the grip such that you need to be properly holding the weapon to fire. Basically if you aren't using a very old or poorly designed weapon and have the least bit of common sense, guns don't go off accidentally.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I also think that Israel's PR is just awful. All they seem to do is put out content that panders to people who are already very pro-Israel, instead of educating and informing those with less knowledge about the conflict. I feel like if instead of the emotional appeals those well-edited videos included actual statistics they might be more successful, it's clear the current approach isn't working.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I think you are greatly confusing Reform Judaism as it is practiced in America with the Reform Judaism practiced by Reform Israelis. Generally speaking, Israeli Reform is based on the idea that the Torah was meant to be interpreted differently through different eras in history and to be adapted for the times Jews are living in. Whether you think they take it too far or not is irrelevant, they are Jewish and practice Jewish traditions, get a Brit Milah at birth and read the same passages of Torah on Shabbat as every other stream. They are also stricter in practice than American Reform insofar as they reject patrilineal descent and other fundamental stances American Reform Jews take.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I recently finally cracked an issue I've had for months that's basically put me out of a back camera, because it wasn't focusing. I thought it might be the laser focus messing up, or a software issue, but it turns out that the phone seems incapable of physically moving the lens to focus. What's really interesting is that this happens in both my old camera and the replacement that I bought for the phone. Anyone face/solve a similar issue recently? Any help is appreciated.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>ISIS is not a reasonable threat to Israel. They have very little support in the West Bank and Gaza, and haven't attempted any attacks on Israel. This policy of holding the ruling power responsible for the actions of fringe groups is also consistent with what Israel has done in Gaza. In the past, when Islamic Jihad was launching missiles, Hamas would generally face a retaliatory attack along with Islamic Jihad, as a sort of pressure on them to control their population better. Whether you think that this is because they just wanted an excuse to strike Hamas (and possibly Assad in the case of Syria) is a point up for debate. But Syria is a much more valid target geopolitically because of Syria's support from Iran and Hezbollah. A blow to Assad is by extension a blow to those groups as well, which is a much better return on the risk of running these strikes.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>There is a lot more justified ideology behind a lot of what you're saying than what many people will stereotype as the average Trump supporter, which is very refreshing to see frankly. My biggest problems with Trump however are three things: 1) He has cultivated a fan base that has incredibly bigoted viewpoints. I realize this in all likelihood isn't the majority of Trump supporters, but a candidate that makes [Milo Yiannapopulous](http://headspacepress.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/Screen-Shot-2016-07-20-at-4.36.04-AM.png) seem like a legitimate representative of one of his largest voting blocs is way way way too much for me. Even if only 1% of the pro-Trump people I've seen on Twitter aren't trolls there is still way more anti-semitism in that base than anyone reasonable can be comfortable with. 2) More importantly, most of his policies/goals has been proven to be either impossible to achieve or wouldn't do the magical things for the US that he claims. This is particularly true of his tax/economic plan, his blatant ignorance to environmental issues, and a lack of understanding of foreign policy. He does all this while, according to many reports, refusing to listen to advisers who are experts in these fields, instead opting to do whatever he feels will antagonize his enemies more, even if that means flipping on most of his opinions from a decade ago 3) I'm not a fan of the grand-standing professional-entertainer style of campaigning. The most iconic and effective leaders have been statesmen, masters of diplomacy and effective compromise to do what is best for their people. In Israel we look at leaders like Menachem Begin (whatever your opinions on him may be) to see how to appeal to a previously unrepresented population without aggravating everyone else. Being an outsider doesn't earn him my vote if he lies as much as everyone else and all he manages to do better than the politicians he keeps calling out is entertain the media. /rant</TEXT>

    <TEXT>To be fair, I've actually attended an AIPAC conference once and man the people in attendance are not people who actually understand Israel. They are very passionately Zionist yes, but in many ways it is a huge circlejerk that doesn't address many PR-related problems that Israel does have (like the Foreign Ministry's absolutely abysmal advertising and PR strategy) and the members are never asked any hard questions. AIPAC's policy conference to me seemed like a lot of very very wealthy people coming together to plan how to lobby congressmen. One of the popular ways they did it was offering free all-expenses-paid vacations to Israel, with an AIPAC provided guide. That made me a bit uncomfortable.</TEXT>

    <TEXT> gt;For the 2003 #8211;2004 session, the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP)[64] rated Byrd's voting record as being 100% in line with the N.A.A.C.P.'s position on the thirty-three Senate bills they evaluated. Sixteen other senators received that rating. My bad, this rating was for 2003-2004. He does seem to have been an asshole in the 60s (and beyond if you go into LGBT rights but that's another topic). But I am not quite sure how this makes Hilary Clinton a racist besides that someone she went to for political advice who later voted against her in 2008 was a racist in the past. This is particularly true in comparison to Trump. If both of the candidates disturb you in the context of race relations vote third party, but claiming that Clinton is less racist than Trump is false by most measures. And anyways I *very* much doubt that many people are voting for Trump for race reasons (that is to say because Clinton is more racist in their eyes).</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Personally, I'm very happy that people are finally doing something. The Knesset approved a law that mandated the creation of an egalitarian section of the kotel months ago, and have been sitting on their hands since. The most shameful thing about this is the way people reacted. I was an onlooker at an egalitarian weeknight Minha service a couple months ago and one guy started physically tackling worshippers, another threw water bottles into the crowd, and then they brought in whistles to try and disrupt the Amida. The behavior was disgusting, and they had just prayed in the courtyard! This is not desecration, and to think that you have the right to manhandle a Torah scroll because a woman is carrying it is absurd.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Robinson's arch is kind of a joke. The compromise that passed called specifically for an equivalent space. A place that is clearly signed and known to the public. Robinson's arch was an attempt at appeasement that failed because they had promised more. When I arrive at the kotel, American tourist or not, I should have the clear choice of going to an egalitarian or non-egalitarian service.  gt;Particularly knowing from previous incidents how a single Torah riled people up. Why is multiple smarter? So just because people present don't approve it shouldn't be done? That goes against many of the principles this country was founded on, never mind that these people are performing the absolute essence of nonviolent resistance, and therefore the people reacting physically are not and cannot be justified.  gt;The dati world doesn't want the egal/prog/alt Judaism world encroaching it's values upon it. If they don't want the prog streams enroaching on them then treat them in the same way that the Orthodox movement is treated. Is it so unreasonable for the Kotel to have three sections (men, women, egalitarian) that they must be relegated to what is objectively a less significant place to those people? They represent about 60% of actively religious Jews and if Israel wants to call itself a home for Jews that 60% shouldn't be slighted in such a [blatant](http://www.timesofisrael.com/western-wall-deal-nixed-deri-said-to-tell-associates/) fashion. If the dati world cannot live with an egalitarian section adjacent to it then they have other issues to solve that aren't related to combating progressive movements.  gt;"borrowing" scrolls from the men's side Haven't ever heard of this happening, as far as I know Woman of the Wall have always brought their own scrolls. If it is happening I'd agree with you that that isn't okay. This form of protest is their only reasonable recourse at this time, and they're doing it in a non-violent way.

    <TEXT>For domestic issues, my personal suggestion would be to look at the platforms of Parties in the [Knesset](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knesset), Israel's parliament. Typically these platforms indicate issues that are important to their voters. It's worth noting that some parties lack much domestic policy chops (Likud is notable for this), while others make it their primary focus (Yesh Atid, Kulanu, and the Ultra Orthodox parties Shas and UTJ) Generally speaking here are a few domestic issues that spring to mind for me as a citizen: - Separation of Church and State - High rent and housing prices - Ethiopian and Eritrean refugees/immigrants - [This natural gas deal](http://www.jpost.com/Israel-News/Politics-And-Diplomacy/Netanyahu-signs-off-on-natural-gas-deal-437620), and energy usage in general is always a news topic - Benefits for the Ultra-Orthodox (no mandatory military service, paid to study rather than work, etc.) - I'm leaving out domestic terrorism because that information is already available on shabak.gov You might have noticed that despite not taking a particular stand on domestic issues, Likud still has the most seats in the Knesset. This is because in Israel many people vote on "security" alone, and PM Netanyahu has spent much of his career billing himself as Mr. Security with a fair amount of success. Hope this helps!</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I personally wouldn't define the bill as racist, but as someone that hears these calls every day, I do not agree with silencing the calls. It does feel like an intentional power-play of sorts by Netanyahu to try and "show the Arabs who's boss". The effect of the calls is overblown IMO and doesn't need to have laws surrounding it. I've met a grand total of two people with any serious complaints about being disturbed by the calls, and both lived within 200m of a mosque. EDIT: Also gonna add those two people bought their houses AFTER the mosque was built, therefore invalidating any serious complaints about the noise. To me it feels like buying a house near an airport but refusing to put in glazed windows.</TEXT>

    <TITLE>Having trouble running timed function within an IRC bot</TITLE>
    <DATE>2016-11-15 17:57:44</DATE>
    <TEXT>So I'm trying to code a fairly simplistic IRC bot, I have succeeded in connecting to the server as well as reading, parsing, and sending messages, but I've run into one snag that I can't seem to figure out. One of the functions of the bot is that when a certain launch phrase is used, the bot will randomly select a user in the channel and ping them at random intervals for 5 minutes (this sounds annoying but I promise it has a purpose). The problem I ran into was that while the bot runs in a `while True` loop, it will stop and not progress through the loop until a new message has been sent in the channel. I tried remedying this by running a timer in a separate function but that was unsuccessful. So far my code looks essentially like this: while True: if messageInQueue == True and nextMessageTime == datetime.datetime.now(): #in my code this is changed so that if the current time is within a range close enough to the schedule it will send regardless ExecRestofCode() data = irc.rcv(4096) #retrieves newest entry in channel ONLY when a new message is present. This is the problematic line if(msg = "launch phrase"): #condition nextMessageTime =ScheduleNextMessage(): #set the time for the next message to a datetime sometime in the next minute messageinQueue = True So what I'm trying to do is essentially be able to schedule a message to send at a specific time while still being able to read all incoming messages in the channel. I was able to figure out that the data recieve line is the cause because if I happen to send a message at the same second as the message is scheduled to be sent it will send successfully. Any help is greatly appreciated!</TEXT>

One of those traits is Respect of Human Life. Another is Honesty. A third is Responsibility. And a fourth is Purity of Arms. Many many many units today sat with their commanders to discuss this verdict, and it is on the basis of everything mentioned above that they will discuss it.</TEXT>

The fact that he shot someone who attacked a soldier is irrelevant in the eyes of the law, which we follow because we aren't a backwards fascist society.

    <TEXT>http://www.businessinsider.com/death-risk-statistics-terrorism-disease-accidents-2017-1  gt;According to a September 2016 study by Alex Nowrasteh at the Cato Institute, a libertarian think tank, some 3,024 Americans died from 1975 through 2015 due to foreign-born terrorism. That number includes the 9/11 terrorist attacks (2,983 people) and averages nearly 74 Americans per year.  gt;Since 9/11, however, foreign-born terrorists have killed roughly one American per year. Six Americans have died per year at the hands, guns, and bombs of Islamic terrorists (foreign and domestic). The US is restricting access to potential contributors to the American economy, who have already been vetted and determined to not be a security threat, because of their country of origin. This vetting is doing an *incredible* job. 1 terrorist death per year since 9/11? In a country of 300 million, of which 3.3 million are muslims (who this ban is obviously targeting) and of which 65% are first generation (and thus foreign born). **Edit:** Another study of all mass shootings by Mother Jones. Obviously many are not related to white nationalism or islamic terrorism, but a quick glance shows that the number passes six per year easily, particularly in recent years. https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1XV4mZi3gYDgwx5PrLwqqHTUlHkwkV-6uy_yeJh3X46o/pub?output=html amp;widget=false#</TEXT>

[On average, foreign born Islamists have killed one American per year since 9/11 and Islamists terrorists *born in America* have killed 6 per year.](http://www.businessinsider.com/death-risk-statistics-terrorism-disease-accidents-2017-1) That's an *amazing* track record for terrorism, especially that foreign born stat, and completely proves that restricting access to foreigners who want to immigrate and contribute to the American economy after having already been vetted and determined to not be a security threat (or shitty person if you'd prefer) is silly because these immigrants are less likely to shoot or kill someone than the average american born citizen. **Let me repeat that: immigrants from Muslim countries are less likely to kill people than American-born citizens, and foreign born terrorists are responsible for a number of terrorists attacks in America far too small to justify the costs of keeping them out**</TEXT>

The law is very obviously a reaction to Amona, which should have been demolished under the sane inerpretation of the law not only in Israel, but in any democratic country. What actually makes it obviously not just an application of eminent domain is that the law is ONLY applicable in the West Bank. If only eminent domain was relevant then the law would be applicable in all of Israel, not just the area where people happen to have an interest in building on private land that isn't theirs.</TEXT>

The suspicion that he had a bomb vest doesn't hold up to scrutiny, particularly because he is still supposed to tell his commander before he shoots even in that situation (and he knew this, he learned it in tironut). Not to mention that he testified that he told a friend that he had this suspicion, but somehow the defense couldn't find anyone to confirm that. Pretty much nothing Azaria himself said had any legal validity throughout the trial, because his own testimonies differed drastically from each other. Since the judges didn't know which testimony to trust, they couldn't trust any and all testimonial evidence from Azaria himself was thrown out or even used against him as proof of a motive that he wasn't willing to say. The idea of a prosecutor being overzealous is also invalid. The prosecutor's job is to try and extract the hardest possible punishment for the crime, while the defense's job is to reduce it as much as possible. It is from this conflict that all evidence is presented and fair judgments are made. Telling a prosecutor to not pursue the harshest sentence to the best of his ability is to tell him not to do his job.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>1) The UN has nothing to do with the IDF upholding the Geneva Convention. We do it because we're decent human beings, and it's important to rain decent human beings even in war, even when your friend just got stabbed, and especially when there is no mediate threat. 2) malice also has nothing to do with the law either. Since it's a murder, we're looking at intent and premeditation, the answers to which are yes and probably no. That makes his crime murder (what weeks be called 2nd degree murder in the US). The law doesn't care if you have the best reason in the world as long as that reason isn't self defense. The military has similar standards, and since he couldn't even prove his *suspicion* of a bomb best (which the defense dropped as a reason) I don't think it's reasonable to beleive that assertion of his.</TEXT>

    <TEXT> gt;Kidding aside, you'll get fluent if you immerse yourself in Hebrew. This is the correct answer. I made aliyah 2.5 years ago, understood conversations in 6-7 months and after 2 years drafted as an Israeli into a role where my fluent understanding and speaking Hebrew is essential. The trick was doing *everything* in Hebrew. Talk to your wife in Hebrew, change your phone's system language (and your PC's if it wouldn't impact your work too much, RTL on Windows is annoying), insist on Hebrew when shopping and don't let the cashier use English to make it easy. If your work allows ask your Israeli coworkers to speak to you in Hebrew. You'll know it's working when you can count your English interactions/day on your fingers. You'll *really* know it's working when you start speaking Hebrew without thinking about it, even for small everyday things. Good luck! (Worth noting that what I've said above is applicable to conversational Hebrew, whereas professional Hebrew is typically the domain of an Ulpan or your workplace/bills.)</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Israel gets better ping to German servers than they do to Dubai/ME ones, because of excessive packet rerouting needed to get Israeli packets to other ME states. If Israelis want the best ping in CSGO it has to be in the EU qualifier. It's been this way for ESWC for years as well as ESEA ladders and even ESL's Go4CSGO tourneys. Regardless, on most decent connections it's ~60ms, totally livable in most cases. IL ping to other ME servers is typically more than 100, in fact the Palestinian ESWC team complained about high ping in last years qualifiers on HLTV and some were calling for them to qualify in EU like Israel because it's the same infrastructure. There is WAY more to this than geography, and for all practical purposes Israelis are better off playing CSGO on European servers for the time being. It also provides better competition and a better environment (ME CSGO is known for being infested with cheaters).</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Those that need Hebrew for their work, whether they cross the border to work in mainland Israel, or work in a settlement, or with any other Hebrew speaking company/clientele often possess a minimum to professional proficiency in the language, and can probably hold a basic conversation. University educated Palestinians are generally fluent, and the rest typically don't speak much Hebrew because it's not that necessary if you already have an Arabic-speaking job and it isn't easy/convenient to learn if you just stay in the WB either. If you're hoping to tour the WB and get by on just Hebrew, you'll probably have better luck with English in many places. If you meet a WB Palestinian in non-WB Israel chances are he speaks some Hebrew (although he'll probably know some English too)</TEXT>

(Also the vast majority of the people answering here are olim and that brings it's own biases with it, the olehs service experience is very different from the average Israeli's) Unless you have specific skills that are useful to the army (doctor, certain academic degrees), they can and *will* give you a job no one else wants to do and there is next to nothing you will be able to do about it. As part of integrating into society it is incredibly helpful, of that there is no doubt, but it comes with such a glaring downside that I couldn't in good faith recommend it to someone unless they could guarantee themselves a good spot somehow.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Even in 8200 there are many cs degree jobs that aren't glamorous. But besides that I've even seen CS majors writing assembly to fix/update vehicles and old hardware here. Also tikshuv absolutely gets a lot of cs and netadmin people and that work can be mind numbingly boring. Important to say though, often when you get that signed paper it will say what part of the army they want to put you in. For the most part if it doesn't say modiin don't sign.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>The debate here isn't actually about how effective they would be in the army. It's fairly obvious that haredi soldiers would have a difficult time adjusting to a largely secular army, and would make more issues with working on shabatot and hagim, which would pretty much exempt them from most  #1514; #1508; #1511; #1497; #1491; #1497; #1501;  #1502; #1489; #1510; #1506; #1497; #1501; unless they actively ask for one. The debate is about the consistent way in which the haredi population is given preferential treatment in Israel. I recently found out that yeshivot are the only publicly funded buildings in Israel which are not required to be handicap accessible, and I wasn't even surprised. The army is the most obvious symptom of this sort of preferential treatment, so it gets all the attention. It's hard to describe how grueling a 3 year long mandatory service can be in tzahal, sometimes in jobs that frankly feel useless, have bad management, little funding, no opportunities for personal growth, and conditions that are sometimes really awful. To then look and see that the government actively subsidizes a population's decision to not participate in this form of civil service and enjoy a relatively relaxed and low-pressure yeshiva environment (never mind the absence of any economic benefit to the country from these subsidies because of how few haredim work) is incredibly frustrating. I agree with you that practically speaking haredim do not need to serve in the army, but I strongly feel they should actively and tangibly contribute to the community/state in some other way instead, such as sherut leumi.</TEXT>

    <TEXT> gt; But Haredi point of view, even amongst those segments which are patriotic, will reply that they are contributing to rebuilding Judaism and doing national service by studying Torah. This isn't a valid response in a society and world where you can't physically prove that your Torah study improves society Besides that, I agree that education and training is important for creating a productive workforce, that's why the government heavily subsidizes education at all levels. I don't see why the haredi population deserve *more* subsidies than the average Israeli in this regard. The reason haredi men already don't go for this training is because they know that can be ok economically without productive work, because of the aforementioned subsidies that the government provides. When looking at it from this angle, taking away the subsidies is just as effective at getting the haredi population into the working force, because it puts them on par with the rest of the population (who like in any other place in the world need to work to survive)</TEXT>

At the end of the day there will always be people that can't attend because of politics or other issues and debconf has to make their decision not based on these factors but rather how vibrant the user community is, the local corporate support, and the bid offered. On a side note, when I attended GCPNext in Tel Aviv I saw a number of Ramallah and other Area A based companies represented.

    <TEXT>If you're a competent programmer, my only suggestion might be to try and use Selenium to find the photo within the page and save it, then add the description of the photo as metadata. The problem is that Facebook constantly obfuscates their site so you would probably find yourself fixing the program often. Another less sophisticated solution would be to use Autohotkey to just screenshot every photo in the group. Because the site elements change depending on the resolution and aspect ratio, it would have to leave in at minimum the area under the photo, many pictures will be letter-boxed, and you won't be getting full resolution. Neither of these solutions maintain themselves, so you will have to be changing or rerunning the scripts manually. EDIT: Just remembered that you might be able to make an IFTTT recipe for this!

    <TEXT>As /u/helpfulcherry said, the adapter you need is a Minolta MC to Cannon EF adapter. *However* because of the flange distances of the mounts the adapter will have glass in it, and for the most part adapters with glass kinda suck, and they will kill your images. It's worth doing some research on the subject before pulling the trigger on an adapter. PS,: glassless MC-EOS adapters will not focus to infinity!</TEXT>

    <TEXT>My grandad was a maxillofacial surgeon, used to take pictures on his film camera to bring to conferences and such. In fact, finding his gear when he passed away is what got me into photography! If there's one thing I can say for sure about this kind of work, it's that you'll need a macro lens. Depending on how well lit you can get your subject (harsh lighting as is typical in medicine can create sharp shadows with very dark spots so you will need to be mindful of that) you will either need to use a flash or have a fast lens, which you will probably learn more about after reading the FAQ. But really, in your use case macro is a must, many kit lenses these days don't focus much closer than 0.7-1 meter and that is probably too far for you. Good luck!</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Crop factor does affect compression, so using the 1D4 will be the compression equivalent of 540mm on FF. Now you have to choose whether you want more resolution (perhaps to crop, which will also enhance compression) or to have the compression from the start.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>For a lot of people, a 1" sensor size is simply too large to be useful much of the time, because with a relatively larger sensor comes smaller DoF. At closer focus distances I think this will be an inconvenience to many casual users.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Casual phone users want their whole frame in focus (or a very blurry background only achievable by software at these sensor sizes). At a 1" sensor size f/1.8 lens if you focus on a relatively close subject that has some depth, only part of it will be in focus. IIRC MKBHD's S20 ultra video covered this well. To top it off the bokeh it produced was really busy and unpleasant.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>The S20 ultra, which is the largest sensor in a mainstream phone we have today, is a constant aperture f1. 8 with a 1/1.33" sensor size. MKBHD explains the problem best in his review here (skip to around 8:20 for the relevant bit): https://youtu.be/-wOdL7HFNOs Of course larger sensors are better in many ways, but if you're going to be stuck at f1.8 all the time a sensor as large as 1" will start to be a pain in certain cases.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Samsung seemed fine puting a constant aperture f1.8 on a 1/1.33" sensor, they may very well decide the better low light performance is worth it. Your RX100 has a variable aperture, so I don't thing it's as comparable from this point of view.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I shoot exclusively with MD mount lenses on an XT-1 while I'm saving up for Fuji lenses. I find the manual focus aids great (focus peaking in particular). The adapters are glassless and focus to infinity, the problem is that unlike on native bodies, some lenses will focus *past* infinity and the amount varies by lens. The fix is to add padding inside the adapter somehow, I used folded aluminum foil and it fixed the problem for some but not all the lenses. The other thing to note is that you can not really trust the DoF indicator on the lens anymore. Have fun! It's great and very affordable glass.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>According to the WSJ the extent of last nights violence in Portland was a single digits amount of balloons filled with paint. For you to call this nightly rioting is pretty indicative of your own preconceived notions. In addition, recently protestors in Portland have made it abundantly clear they are looking for statewide and federal reform, particularly since the police at the protests there now are Oregon State troopers who have been deputized by the federal government and therefore aren't subject to whatever city level reforms have been implemented.  gt;We disrupt the Western-prescribed nuclear family structure requirement by supporting each other as extended families and  #8220;villages #8221; that collectively care for one another, especially our children, to the degree that mothers, parents, and children are comfortable. - BLM's website Calling this "dismantling" the family unit is really not an accurate depiction, especially when the village culture they describe is essentially a kibbutz/commune.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>No, but it doesn't matter anyway because protests at the moment do not revolve around communal living. For a more local (to me at least) example, consider this: Yesh Atid is a big part of organizing the protests around Bibi's house at the moment, and their website pretty explicitly states that they want to enforce the Haredi draft law. Does that mean that the Jerusalem protestors today are primarily fighting for Haredi drafting? The answer is clearly not, and you can see this from the signs they bring, the speeches they give, and the interviews they do with news orgs.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Hey all! My country (Israel) has recently entered a strict lockdown given our high levels of Covid infection and the current high holidays, and I wanted to get one last outing to the beach in before they closed for what will probably be the rest of the normal beach-going season. Israel has a west facing coast, which lends itself to a very contrasty and textured looking pattern in the water around sunset. The fisherman is a local regular, and I found his silhouette against the detailed texture very serene and pleasing. The original shot shows the horizon and some sky, but I cropped it out to keep the composition simpler. If it interests anyone, this was shot on a Fuji X-T1 with a Minolta MC 2.8/135mm Feedback is appreciated!</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I am trying to improve my skills in documentary photography, and a protest near my house seemed like a good opportunity. This past Saturday night there were protests all over the country about the governments' handling of the pandemic, as well the PM Netanyahu's ongoing corruption/breach of trust trial(s). I have been interested in documenting Haifa's rich modern history of progressive protest and diversity now that I live here, and this is my most compelling result so far. The object being dragged depicts a submarine, since Case 3000 relates to corruption involved in the sale of German submarines to the Navy and kickbacks associated with the sale. The text reads "Traitor 3000". Feedback is appreciated!</TEXT>
