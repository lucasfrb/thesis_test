    <TEXT>Interesting! I am assuming that the analysis, presumely done by law enforcement, would know which type of gun is being used (pistol/rifles/etc) but lets say a person was caught with a 'ghost gun' days after its use, is it really still considered 'hot'? How would law enforcement know that THIS ghost gun was used in a specific moment or event? I know guns themselves get hotter when used so if someone was caught an hour, enforcement can feel the gun and tell if its been recently used but how would it be possible days after?</TEXT>

    <TEXT> gt; As it exits the barrel, imperfections in the boring of the barrel itself will leave a completely unique pattern on the sides of the bullet (like a finger print) This is very interesting! So you are saying if i buy two pistols from the exact manufacturer and shoot both of them in the same direction at the same time, the bullets (not the shells themselves) will have a unique pattern on it? Or will this 'fingerprint' largely depend on how the gun was made? Also, is it possible to control this pattern or not? **Edit:** I assume this is the fingerprint you are talking about?

    <TEXT>Hi, sorry for the late reply but actually I **do want** a VM that destroys itself every 30 minutes (including all the data within it). If i did not, i would have just stuck with ClearDB where they store my data or just host my own and never needed to ask this question but its the fact I want a temporary VM. The problem with MySQL add-on's is that 1. I have to sign up with a service 2. Need to force it to erase the DB every run 3. Need a CC to verify</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Throwaway account for obvious reasons. How come most Intezer blog posts get 100+ upvotes and 0 comments? I always see this when it comes to Intezer. The blog post somewhat looks original but the thing is that, every blogpost they make is anti-Iranian or Russian (atleast from awhile ago, maybe they switched?). It also does not help that this Israeli company has has never reported on big campaigns like the NGO Group (also based in Israel)</TEXT>

    <TEXT>True but atleast blogposts have material and actually try to educate something. I have seen this with all others (like Malwarebytes, Kaspersky, COMODO, etc). However, the Israeli-based Intezer feels like 20% netsec material and 80% political propaganda. You never see this with Kasperksy, a Russian based company. They do report on Russian malware, even if they have ties with the Russian government.</TEXT>

    <TITLE>Making an app that gets authorization from a 3rd party service, how to deal?</TITLE>
    <DATE>2020-07-17 19:05:10</DATE>
    <TEXT>I am trying to make this app that gets authorization from a 3rd party site. I want to check for two conditions: * If the user has a GUI (for Windows, Mac, etc) * If a user is running without a gui (for users using Ubuntu server) I have to open an external site so the user can login, confirm they want to allow my app access, and then the external service redirects them to a URL of my choice. My plan was this: 1. Run a small server (using Flask) on the users PC, so the server would be looking for https://localhost:5000/authlisten 2. User gets directed to website, logs in and confirms 3. Third party redirects to [https://localhost:5000/authlisten](https://localhost:5000/authlisten), confirming validation The problem is, this wont work if a user is running headless (without a gui) since there is no webbrowser to open so I am somewhat stuck on what I can do: This is my code so far: [https://pastebin.com/raw/a7eL7mwA](https://pastebin.com/raw/a7eL7mwA) Any suggestions would be helpful</TEXT>

All of a sudden, two messages that look like this:  gt;Still available? I #8217;ll prefer text XXXXXXXXXX And then  gt;Still available? I #8217;ll prefer text (XXX) XXX-XXXX I think its maybe the default message for craigslist but after looking up the number, the first number is owned by bandwidth(dot)com and the second is owned by Enflick (now known as TextNow) Are these the default messages for craigslist?</TEXT>

However, another function called ReplaceInfo() is also there too! Currently, when you click the button, the script just adds the info from ReplaceInfo() to the table. However, I would like it to replace the info by looking at their "ID" numbers. So the values in ID 0 would be replaced and so on.

If i inspect the page [http://websdr.ewi.utwente.nl:8901](http://websdr.ewi.utwente.nl:8901) , I see a websocket is created (the audio version is: ws://websdr.ewi.utwente.nl:8901/\~\~stream ).

Saved! Saved! Saved! Saved! Saved! Saved! Saved! Saved! Saved! Saved! Saved! Saved! Saved! Saved! Saved! Saved! Saved! Saved! ... However, opening the file in VLC does not seem to work. I assume I am saving it incorrectly but do not understand why. I am also wondering if they are using any special way of reading the data thats not normal.
