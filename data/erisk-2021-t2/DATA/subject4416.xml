    <TEXT>Mazda 3 2010 LED Glove compartment light replacement. Couldn #8217;t find how to do this anywhere so here it is. 1: remove glove box door by unclipping the slow release hinge and pull out the two holders on either side. 2: remove inner lining using 3 clips at the bottom with a flat head screw driver (they are stubborn to unclip). 3: reach over the roof of the compartment (where the light is) and yank the bulb out of socket (use iPhone camera to locate where the bulb is as it #8217;s not visible). Don #8217;t be afraid to really pull it. By the way this is all in the most awkward position ever and can be difficult to see what your doing and manoeuvre the bulb out. 4: pull the wire down so it #8217;s visible and remove the halogen bulb. 5: Insert new led bulb and then do these steps in reverse.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Mine came red stock. Maybe it #8217;s because I #8217;m in Australia but you should be able to buy some. Just look up what size the bulb for the speedo lights are and type that into eBay or amazon. I #8217;ve got amber and red ones in the T10 size so I #8217;d say they sell them for the speedos.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>There #8217;s actually a reason some BMW drivers don #8217;t use them. BMW German engineered the indicator to make it way more complex than necessarily needed. So it would no longer self cancel and and turning it off is quite difficult and un natural. They later removed this but on the 2010 M5 my uncle owns it remains. It #8217;s also found on many other models from this era. So there #8217;s some reasoning behind it. But most of the time it #8217;s just the drivers being moronic and stupid.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Nostalgic. The Boney M disk was jammed in the crappy 6 disk CD changer in my dads Range Rover we used to take on holiday and when the radio went out it was the Boney M albums the whole way there. I know every song and pretty much all the lyrics. Along with ABBA along with 2000s house album and 90s club music.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Nope. My dad was still listening to these songs in the early 2000s which is why we had the greatest Boney M hits on CD. He does have the record I believe and a tape version of the original album. It was just less practical to use these in the 2000s on a long trip when we access to a CD with all the songs on it pretty much.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Some trade that Mazda did with Toyota more recently. All I #8217;ve noticed from Toyota in the recent years is that they figured out that they #8217;re cars looked boring so they went overboard and now the look completely over styled. Secondly they #8217;ve decided designing cars is too hard so they buy them off other companies: E.g Mazda in this case and BMW in the supras case. I #8217;ve never liked Toyota but nowadays it doesn #8217;t even make sense to buy one. Companies like Mazda offer nicer styled cars with better interiors for a similar price and reliably, same with VW and Hyundai. Anyway. There you go sorry about my quick rant.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Yeah I never minded the old ones just wasn #8217;t my personal pick. Sure they were boring but they did what they needed to do. These new ones aren #8217;t as reliable and look like a 5 year old designed them. Other companies are just doing it better in my opinion. In Australia Toyota is slowly getting caught up by companies such as Mazda and Hyundai. If they don #8217;t do something soon Mazda is getting close sales numbers with the 3 and CX-5 to Toyota #8217;s corolla and Rav-4 and it wouldn #8217;t surprise me if they are overtaken here soon.</TEXT>

We don #8217;t really get them here in Australia but if we did I #8217;d be putting LED switchback globs in so it #8217;s white until you turn on your turn signal and then it flashes orange and returns white once it #8217;s switched off.

    <TEXT>Always thought about doing that but it looks quite difficult and because I live in Australia my indicators need to be orange so going over with red tint would mean I wouldn #8217;t pass rego and it #8217;s not exactly an easy portion of the tail light seeing to cut out.

    <TEXT>Yeah with amber tint in that section would look pretty good. I #8217;ve got an old tail light which is the original halogen globe one I could test it on before I go and do it on my LED ones just to see. I #8217;m also just worried about the tint becoming matte, cracking, fading or ruining the tail lights beneath it. I #8217;ll have to do some more research and watch some tint videos on Mazda 3s.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Got some cut offs from an led strip (mainly used for behind furniture and so on) that has white leds. Then soldered two wires to the positive and white connection (make sure to use tape to cover any bare wires. Then I removed the reflectors there is one screw behind them. Stuck the led strip underneath the reflector so it would shine up through it. Routed the cable through the smaller hole located behind the reflector. Pushed the reflector back down into place and screwed it back on. Then the other end of the wire was simply twisted around the metal prongs of the LED plate lights. Make sure to use electrical tape so it doesn #8217;t short out and blow a fuse. Also make sure you use some red sharpie on the led strip as Some of the white was visible towards the bottom of the reflector. Then your done. Was super easy. Also don #8217;t let soldering put you off, it #8217;s very easy and I #8217;ve only got a really cheap soldering iron. Only took I #8217;d say less than an hour for me. I really wanted those leds replacement reflectors so many people have but they don #8217;t make them for my AUS bumper so I made my own.

    <TEXT>Number plate bulbs and Parking globes were first. Super easy it #8217;s just a straight swap. On my gen 2 these are t10 leds. Interior lights use festoon globes (make sure you get the right sized ones) and they simply snap in once the lens is removed. Then I did the indicators. I used t20 amber leds with a t20 led resistor adapter so there #8217;s no need for splicing. Headlights where super easy and I would highly recommend the Nighteye brand as they #8217;re cheap, bright and reliable and this was a straight swap too. It #8217;s very easy. They #8217;re should be plenty of videos on the subject too. If you #8217;ve got a Gen 2 and you #8217;re stuck ask me Ive changed every globe imaginable to LED in my car.

    <TEXT>Yes it #8217;s amazing. Trying to convince my mum to buy a dealer used one with it optioned (which I doubt will work but I #8217;ll try) also just found out you can option this pack on any spec including the base model. It gets you the diffuser, spoiler, side skirts, front lip and 18 inch alloys. All for $2700ish AUD I think. Pricing seems vague. But for the price it makes it look like a top spec even if you #8217;ve bought a base model.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Looks amazing. I #8217;ve gone full led. Not a single incandescent bulb in my car. Like anywhere, I even changed the glove box light. I hate the yellow tint of the stock globes. Ice white just looks so good. I #8217;ve got LED indicators and the instant on off effect they provide looks amazing. I live in aus so mine are just indicators and the parking lights are separate globes so it was very easy for me to change them. I #8217;ve recently put some LED strips on the lower vents where the fog lights are and it looks very nice. Bit of a hack job but I reckon they look pretty good. [LEDs](https://imgur.com/gallery/gph2pup) Also ignore my ugly wheels, they have since been replaced with the MPS ones.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Yes which is why buying a demo model for $33-35k give or take with like 5000-8000kms seems like a good deal. Also considering the other extras such as the sunroof, signature tail lights, added tech features and more. Those halogen DRLs are just awful. Ruins the whole car. Like Mazda how much would it have cost to make the indicators switchback LEDs so that they could be used as DRLs whilst not in use. But anyway they didn #8217;t do that.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Oh that #8217;s weird. I could only find switchback DRL and sequential models here in Australia. There #8217;s three wires from the strip. One is negative DRL, one is positive DRL and the last wire is positive indicator. So I just wired the DRL into my parking lights (since I turn them on every time I drive anyway), and the wire for the indicator I just slid under the metal contact for in the housing for the globe. I already had LED globes for my indicators previously so I already had resistors installed to stop hyperflash. I just used the plug and play resistors which plug into where the stock globe goes in and then on the other end of the resistor there is that same T20 led globe fitting (basically its like an extension cord with a resistor built in). The lights work great but unfortunately I have to wait to put them in as one of them was damaged in postage and I can #8217;t just have one on the front. I #8217;ll probably put up another post once I #8217;ve got them both in.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Just some cheap eBay white led strips (try get ones that are 6000k mine look a little too blue). Soldered some wired to the ends of all 4 and hooked it up to the parking lights original connection. You could also hook it into the battery to use them as DRLs but I turn my parking lights on every time I drive anyway so I didn #8217;t bother. I just used the 3M tape on the back to stick it to the trim and it stays on surprisingly well. May not be as simple for the SP25 or the US spec cars because I think you have different fog light housings and I know that the 2012+ definitely do. Nothing stopping you from sticking them on elsewhere. In total for 2 meters of led strip, wiring (which I ripped of some dead solar fairy lights) and the solder set me back $14 AUS which is like maybe $10 USD. Was pretty easy to install as well. Drilled a hole for each wire to go through in the panel and routed them up to the headlights to be wired in. Looks pretty stock too and not too tacked on looking since it conforms with the original trim that was there. [LED strip close up](https://imgur.com/gallery/2AIzOfG)</TEXT>

You #8217;ve gotta be really careful when wedging the strip into the gab. Broke the first set by pulling the wires too hard.

Anyway not our fault they #8217;re trespassing it #8217;s the negligence of the parents. Our pool shed isn #8217;t compliant being where it is either is it has to have ridiculous fencing thrown all over the roof. Which I #8217;ll remove ASAP when the inspection is done.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>It #8217;s sad too. We planted the trees from a tiny shrub to what they were prior to today. Well yes we can but they have to be 50cm away from the fence and and not overhang the fence by a height of 1 meter. So basically we #8217;re going to plant some nice screening hedges 50cm away from the fence with some standardised flowering trees (maybe gardenias or durantas) in front of that with some ground cover flowers underneath them all the way around the perimeter. It #8217;ll look nice once fully grown but that #8217;ll take years and not to mention thousands of dollars to buy.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Yeah that #8217;s very confusing but it #8217;s no better with the AU models. That #8217;s pretty good compared to what we got, we never got the large head unit or the blind spot system. So this is our awful trim system for only the SP25 (which is the top trim/most expensive and had the 2.5L over the 2.0 the rest of the range had). 2010 had cloth seats and the small nav standard on the lowest trim. Middle trim got leather, Bose and small nav screen. (What I #8217;ve got) Highest got a sunroof, leather, Bose, and small nav. (So only a sunroof over the middle trim) 2012 (AKA the series 2 gen 2) got only one option for the SP25 which had a small nav, iPod USB in the centre console, leather, sunroof, Bose, push button start with proximity keyless entry, auto level HIDs, and better looking 17 inch wheels. The MPS 2010-2011. Just got what the middle spec Sp25 from 2010 did. No sunroof available either. And the MPS 2012-2013 got what the SP25 series 2 has minus the sunroof. So that #8217;s ours. Not including all the other models (the 2.0L ones) which gets even more confusing.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Yeah it #8217;s not gonna be very graceful or painless regardless. It #8217;s like that fact you guys can #8217;t have sequential indicators (excluding the mustangs) because not enough light is on at once and then they go and allow dim halogen red turn signals for the rear which I noticed after driving in the US really aren #8217;t easy to see compared to amber ones, they look like one of the brake lights is out for a second and then you realise they #8217;re turning. A lot of the US car design regulations should really be updated I think.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>(I #8217;m not a car audio enthusiast I am not 100% sure what I need) I #8217;ve got a Bose spare tyre sub. Its got a built in amp. It #8217;s got 4 connectors that come out of it. I presume power for the amp and the audio input. Now obviously I #8217;d connect the power to 12v in my car. But I #8217;ve got a stock head unit and I #8217;ve done some research and I #8217;ve found out I need an LOC line output converter. Now I have no idea which one I would need at all. I #8217;d be getting the audio input from one of the rear speakers and need to convert it to be low from a high input. Do I need a powered LOC or a non powered model? Can I hook the power for the subs amp to my cig lighter or is that a terrible idea? Thanks, I hope someone understands what I #8217;m talking about.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>DIY. Just bought some  #8220;eagle eye LEDs #8221; on eBay. It #8217;s basically a bolt with a built in led. Drilled a hole in the mirror and fastened it on with a nut on the inside of the mirror. Wires are run through the mirror, then the door card, through an empty grommet in the door and up through the A pillar to the interior lights in the ceiling. Wasn #8217;t really that hard. Door sill lights are connected to the same power and added some footwell lights in while I was at it using a piece of an LED strip.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Made of just some cheap 5mm led bulbs with a 390 ohm resistor so they can be powered from a 12v power source, some speaker cable for the wiring and little LED bezels (which you don #8217;t really need and I #8217;d recommend not bothering with). You can pick up all the supplies from Ebay. I basically just drilled a small hole in the top of the door handle trim which just pops out with a screw and a couple clips. Fed the wires down into the electric window controls which is where I tapped the LEDs into. They run off the  #8220;ON #8221; power position on they key and stay on while driving. I just tucked the legs from the wire into the harness contact as it #8217;s super tight instead of splicing wires. It was not too difficult. Didn #8217;t even have to remove the door card.

So i cut the smaller connector off the car and then I went to a scrap yard and cut off the Xenon connector from the car. I then soldered that too my car to replace the small connector. The wires match colour to colour. Then I plugged in the new headlights after soldering new connector in and they worked perfectly.

    <TEXT>Yep in AUS. The plates are nice and thin. They #8217;re being replaced with the same plates but in black with white text so it matches the car better. We #8217;ve got hundreds of plate designs down here so you can have ones with sports teams on them, car brands, basically every colour and different country style plates that look like Euro/Jap/US ones. Pretty cool.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>It ended up being around the $43k AUD mark. Mind you that #8217;s with basically all the options on it, brand new 2020 MY G25 ASTINA (top spec) with the Kuroi pack which isn #8217;t cheap either and is like $2500 on it #8217;s own.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Yeah the CX-30 is way more expensive. To be honest I didn #8217;t think that price is worth it. I know everyone is in love with SUVs but let #8217;s be honest here, the CX-30 is just a raised Mazda 3 and they #8217;re charging a hell of a lot more for it. Plus I think the 3 looks much better in my opinion.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Yeah it #8217;s really cool. Of course it comes at one of cost which isn #8217;t that cheap at like $300 AUD but you know it #8217;s yours forever. We do basically get the JDM spec cars down here because they #8217;re RHD so a lot of things carry over including names from Japan. I think they use the Astina name plate in Japan too. We got the 323 Astina in Australia (the protege5 in the US) and we #8217;ve had the Astina name here for ages at the top of the line model. For example on the 3 and Cx-30.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Coming from a Mazda 3 BL 2010 everything feels familiar. The interior plastics scratch like hell so be careful there. The nav screen won #8217;t go into dark mode from factory so you have to do it using the dash brightness buttons to get it to go into auto. Otherwise its been smooth and easy to use. The 3 turbo would sell very well out here as you always see hot hatches around. GTIs, Rs, AMGs, Ms, you name it we have it. I really hope they bring it down here. We love hot hatches down under and I #8217;m always seeing them about.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I think it #8217;s a DR900s. I #8217;m honestly not sure sure what you can do to it. The factory Kuroi kit makes a big difference but it #8217;s expensive. I think the bonnet protector looks good for it too!</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Wow! That #8217;s expensive. Is the GSL the base model? Could have something to do with on-road costs and tax. Maybe emissions tax or something like that? I know in Europe they #8217;re strict on that sorta thing.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Just installed the colour GPS nav screen in my BL maxx. Originally had a black and white basic screen which only showed fuel economy etc. $20 from the wreckers and the colour nav screen plugs straight in. Will need the steering wheel buttons to use nav however. Replaced the plastic steering wheel too with a nice leather one!</TEXT>

    <TEXT>If you #8217;re basing that off the GPS location you #8217;d be wrong. I hadn #8217;t set it up and calibrated my location yet. That location was the smash repairs the wrecked car went to before the parts yard. But still it #8217;s not too far from where I #8217;m at.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Works pretty well. Overall happy with it and have only had a few small issues here and there. Carplay is pretty good but since IOS14 I need to restart the head unit to use carplay which is annoying. Reverse camera works pretty well. Also the steering wheel controls do all function correctly after the install and Bose system is compatible.</TEXT>
