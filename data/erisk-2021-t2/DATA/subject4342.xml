Seen that the H87M-D3H Gigabyte board can support overclocking with the 4670k, is it worth paying an extra  #163;20 to upgrade to the Gigabyte Z87M-D3H to be on the safe side? 3. On choosemypc.net it recommended me this [PSU] (http://pcpartpicker.com/mr/scancouk/evga-power-supply-100b10500kr?ref=mrob), but it's for a slightly different build (full ATX size, GTX 770) saying that the draw would be 97W-413W (oh and no SSD, everything else is practically the same). I'm sceptical about this and planning to stick with the 600W Corsair. Good choice?

I go on the manager page and choose Press Interview option and the interviewer just says "Sorry, I can't take your call right now".</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Recently posted on here about why my hall of fame data had been reset... heh, turns out for some reason the data is in a separate file to your save game and I was working with a different one on my laptop. So I did some editing and managed to merge my latest achievements with Philadelphia with my other larger one back on my PC. [Take a look!](https://imgur.com/a/Lx8pW?gallery) Hopefully this is useful cos I've seen a lot on forums about people complaining that they lost the file or it's bugged out. (and sure, use it to cheat but this data is completely separate to your biography info and actual achievements... so why would you? :P (at least in FM13))</TEXT>

    <TITLE>Request for Hall_of_fame.dat data files</TITLE>
    <DATE>2015-11-25 21:30:37</DATE>
    <TEXT>7 months ago I posted [this](https://www.reddit.com/r/footballmanagergames/comments/31vzjo/guide_on_how_to_edit_your_hall_of_fame_data/) on this sub explaining how I was able to merge a hall of fame data file from my FM13 game on my laptop with my main one on my PC. For those who don't know, hall of fame data is stored in C:\Users\Public\Public Documents\Sports Interactive\Football Manager 20XX, and is separate from your save files (I assume so if you play games with different managers you are all in the same "world" competing). But this makes it annoying when it comes to winning competitions on a different machine and then moving to another to see that hall of fame entries aren't consistent. Basically, to get to the point, I'm looking at the possibility of creating a editor to help people with this problem (or alter their hall of fame data to their hearts desire if they wish), as I don't think this sort of software exists. But I can't do this without gaining general knowledge of what structure and values one FM game may write to this file as it may be different from one game to the next. (I only have FM13 and 15 atm). It would be a big help if I could get as many hall_of_fame.dat files as I can, if you do post them, please state the game and a screenshot of the hall of fame would be really useful too. Thanks.</TEXT>

    <TITLE>Is my paging file too large?</TITLE>
    <DATE>2016-01-09 13:28:35</DATE>
    <TEXT>https://imgur.com/eSIEd7M As you can see the currently allocated size is much larger than what Windows itself recommends. Yet it's allocated 10 times it. I'm asking as I got a BSOD for the first time related to a paging file error after waking up my computer from hibernation. I hibernate quite a lot so could that be why the paging file is so large? Shall I let the OS auto set the paging file size or should I manually set it? Cheers EDIT: Paging file is on C: drive, a 256GB SSD. Drives H and J are external, and I won't have them connected up most of the time. 2ND EDIT: PC fails to wake up from sleep sometimes or just blue screens. Pagefile hasn't gone down and will be running Memory diagonistics and memtest to find out wtf is up. I definitely don't need more RAM because I barely ever hit the capacity. Though I am rather confused about [this](http://puu.sh/mvVCu/907bac610f.png). 5.5G available in OpenHardwareMonitor, 7.9 in Task Manager...</TEXT>

    <TITLE>Have I lost my save data?</TITLE>
    <DATE>2016-01-12 00:48:38</DATE>
    <TEXT>I was following the [subreddit master guide](https://www.reddit.com/r/3dshacks/comments/3ztqqv/all_you_need_to_know_by_popular_demand/) and misread this part here  gt;  gt; If you want to have NNID set up on your EmuNAND instead of your SysNAND (see "Eshop/NNID?" below for reasons why you'd want this), then you should backup your SD card to your Desktop if you haven't already and use the "Other Settings" - gt; "Format System Memory" option under the Settings app now (you will lose your game installs doing this, however, you can redownload them from the eShop (or from a warez site) after installing CFW) . Additionally, you should export any saves you want to keep using svdt[36] ). Thinking that I could just backup my SD card and extract the save files from the backup using svdt, not knowing I needed to export using svdt. In these two gbatemp forum posts they talk about how they recovered some of their save data by restoring sysNAND backup to emunand using emunand9. [Link 1](https://gbatemp.net/threads/restore-savedata-from-eshop-titels-after-cfw-install-themes-on-emunand.408368/#post-5935949) [Link 2](https://gbatemp.net/threads/question-3ds-formatted-is-my-previous-sd-card-data-useless.408581/) I'm trying to do so now, I believe the original sysNAND backup I made before I formatted system memory like a fool is in NAND.bin on the root of my SD card. If I try to clone NAND.bin to EmuNAND it just says: Could not open NAND.bin! Clone NAND.bin to EmuNAND: failed! What do I do? Am I fucked?</TEXT>

    <TITLE>How do I get IronHax on sysnand?</TITLE>
    <DATE>2016-01-12 18:25:39</DATE>
    <TEXT>Have MenuHax working, atm just setting up backup exploit entry points in case one of them becomes broken in the future. Successfully set up OotHax, now I'm trying to install IronHax. Following this pretty good guide [here](http://corbindavenport.com/?p=403), which involves using the eshop old version downloader from homebrew and installing the old IronFall. Problem is is that it appears on my emunand, which is obv not where I want it to be. Do I have to unlink my NNID from my emunand and then to my sysnand, do the process again to make IronFall appear on sysnand, and relink again? Or surely there's a old Ironfall version .cia I could perhaps install on sysnand somehow</TEXT>

    <TITLE>BSOD adventure - probably caused by OC</TITLE>
    <DATE>2016-02-21 21:45:57</DATE>
    <TEXT>First off, the story begins with this reddit post [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/techsupport/comments/4069wh/is_my_paging_file_too_large/). I was getting PAGE FAULT IN A NON-PAGED AREA BSODs at first. This seemed to suggest I had a problem with my RAM or memory. Many Windows Memory Diagnostics and hours of running MemTest x86+ later, it found no problems with my two 4GB G-Skill Red sticks. I have since replaced these sticks with a pair of HyperX 8GB sticks, as it turns out I was using close to what was available of 8GB actually, without realising (a fuckton of tabs and addons in Firefox whilst running CSGO and a bunch of other programs does that apparently). Before these errors, around August/September of last year let #8217;s say, I overclocked my i5-4960k system from 3.4GHz to a (seemingly) stable 4.2GHz with a Cooler Master Nepton 240M Water cooler. Doing the job, CPU max goes 44 degrees. Since replacing the RAM, and I think even before then, I got the occasional IRQL_NOT_LESS_OR_EQUAL BSOD, and it happened again today for the first time in a good while, randomly, during which my PC had been up for quite a while. So I decided to seriously sort it out once and for all. This time, I had dump files to work with, as previously CCleaner had wiped them. So I booted up BlueScreenView to see that the crash address for this IRQL_NOT_LESS_OR_EQUAL was ntoskrnl.exe+14f4d0. After a quick google, I came across [this](http://www.overclock.net/t/1308966/recurring-bsod-caused-by-ntoskrnl-exe) and after a skim deciding to run the driver verifier, set the settings and restarted my PC. It took an age to load up the sign-in screen and even longer to boot up and start start-up programs. Very unresponsive and slow. In the end I just decided to cold restart. I think it was on this next boot I went into the bios and decided to reduce the overclock from 4.2 to 4.1 and set the memory stability to from Normal to Extra Stability. (GIGABYTE GA Z97M #8211;DS3H) Then most of my start-up programs would not start and a pop-up saying:  #8220;The application was unable to start correctly (0xc0000005). Click OK to close the application. #8221; came up for each. Restarted again. Set OC to 4.0, reset the memory stability, and underclocked the frequency to 1833MHz. Then appeared the new BSOD, DRIVER_VERIFIER_DETECTED_VIOLATION, every time I logged in and ran my start-up programs. On these start-ups, the login screen would take ages to appear again, logging in would take a while, but start-up would seem normal. [(Probably related!)](https://www.reddit.com/r/techsupport/comments/269nw4/attempting_to_fix_bsod_issues_ran_driver_verifier/) I decided to completely revert my OC to default settings, and started again. It was still a bit slow on boot, but not BSOD this time on logging in. I closed all unnecessary start-up programs just in case, and I think it #8217;s because I stopped GIGABYTE #8217;s OC Guru from starting, as the BlueScreenViewer report has the driver at fault as GPCIDrv64.sys. A quick search and that is identified as Gigabyte #8217;s VGA Tools  #8211; Easy Boost, I assume something to do with overclocking the GPU (which I have done before in the past, but I am pretty sure I just have a stored profile for my GPU OC, the default profile is always loaded on boot). Yep  #8211; I loaded the program up and I blue screened with DRIVER_VERIFIER_DETECTED_VIOLATION, back from that now. So couple questions I have are: 1. Have I missed anything? What #8217;s my next course of action? 2. Do I just simply now not use that program, uninstall it, remove the driver, or perhaps update it, see if it doesn #8217;t cause me problems after? 3. Should I restore my OC after I clear this whole mess up? (Probably not right, since it's most likely the singular cause for all of this) Attached are the [dumps](https://www.dropbox.com/sh/8vnocz7bk9slsy3/AABKZ0loSQgdd3hipkE9ByEza?dl=0) and [screenshots](https://imgur.com/a/Ux2FY).</TEXT>

    <TITLE>What is this strange transparent window outline that I see all the time?</TITLE>
    <DATE>2016-10-05 21:49:35</DATE>
    <TEXT>I have had this [strange thing](https://puu.sh/rz0Nb/5932e787b3.jpg) on my pc desktop for god knows how long now, and I have always just dismissed it. Finally decided to try and do something about it. It doesn't go on top of any other windows, only when I minimise windows and see it on top of my desktop. Funnily enough, when I show desktop, it disappears. It's not in task view and afaik it isn't causing any harm to my pc (inb4 key logger). Also before you ask, no it's not a part of my background. EDIT 10/10 So a couple of days ago I saw it above a window (firefox I believe it was). I forgot to capture it. Today it has displaced itself to the right as seen [here](http://puu.sh/rEtTn/01029b4088.jpg). Culprit may be one of these two. [pivot_Startup](http://puu.sh/rEu1p/9472bbd6ce.png) or [DT_Startup](http://puu.sh/rEu4c/304991d99a.png) - but I know DT startup seems to be related to Display Pilot, a software for my BenQ monitor. EDIT- [Solved!](https://superuser.com/questions/890404/unable-to-find-cause-of-transparent-box-with-border-on-deskop) Turns out it was AirDroid. It started drawing extra boxes as well and when I closed the process the boxes vanished.</TEXT>

    <DATE>2017-01-29 01:54:39</DATE>
    <TEXT>Do I need to clean wipe and clean install Lineage coming from a nightly build of CM14.1? My friend he installed the experimental build, then the nightly build of Lineage for his OPO dirty, (and said this was required?) and hasn't clean installed for a long time. Recommened to clean wipe just in case? Also a general question. I always TWRP backup builds before installing a new ROM, OTA Nightly or any bigger update. Is there any point backing up the data partition since it adds like around 6GB to my backup, and I already backup all apps and data through Titanium Backup? And on the subject of Titanium, is there a better tool to use now for backing up apps and app data? I've used it for many years, just wondering if it's being used less, if there are any quicker alternatives with extra features, better perf and/or better UI?</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Why comment such absolute low tier joke that has already been made? I think some people are just not as sentient as others, and you're a pod. There's nothing going on in that brain of yours. You have no soul. You're an automatron. I want to experiment on you to see what else prefabricated comes out of that robotic ant brain of yours. I've just outed you as less than human. I dare you to say something original that you came up with on your own, robot. "Beep-boop beep-boop, I'm a fucking robot, I say whatever the fuck comes into my mind," that's you. You intrigue me, automatron. But I pity your existence.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Student residences are mostly first years, yes. Typical rule is the further from campus (fallowfield /Withington) the crazier it is, people have already mentioned owens Park, oak house. City campus halls tend to be mostly internationals, postgrads, or hard working, not too social people's. Victoria Park is like a mix of both extremes. Imo, anyway. House sharing will definitely be cheaper. With the huge student population in Manchester too, rent is very competitive.</TEXT>

I press an arrow key (such as down or right) and the finder disappears and excel fills up the whole workspace. I can't really find anything on it as of yet. Does anyone have any ideas?

    <TITLE>Able to "log in" on MBP but then nothing loads and it restarts</TITLE>
    <DATE>2017-05-31 11:23:41</DATE>
    <TEXT>So bit of background, I noticed that browsing on Chrome, opening new tabs to websites, new page, settings would always result in a crash. I wasn't able to do any browsing without either quitting chrome and starting it up again, or restarting the mac altogether. At this point Firefox would also take ages to load sites, and respond when I'm typing sites into the address bar and appear with the big spinning ball of death. But then it would eventually respond again. This happened many times over the past few days and normally a restart of the mac would make things dandy again. Kept happening, so decided to reinstall Chrome. It would uninstall fine, I used AppCleaner, but reinstalling using the dmg came up with two errors, "no such package" and "bad signature" (or something along those lines, can't reemmber the exact wording). Thought I had some sort of mac malware/virus, so tried BitDefender from the App Store telling me everything was ok. So still without Chrome, (and now without Videostream for Chrome (an add-on) and Chrome Remote Desktop, as I uninstalled these), I decided to do a restart to see if that would fix things. Now on bootup, I can login fine, it accepts my password, but then the loading bar appears and nothing loads, and the mac restarts. Any ideas guys? I have checked Disk Utility already and everything is fine and I don't seem to have any Time Machine backups on the MBP itself, it just says "Searching for backups" for ages :( EDIT: MBP 2015 15" i7 16GB RAM, Running latest macOS Sierra 10.12.5 EDIT #2: Solved by going to the genius bar, turns out malware was affecting the Startup Daemons/plists or something. Deleted these and some caches it logged in fine. Removed BitDefender too, might have also been causing problems.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Hi all Been having a nightmare time with my WD Green 3TB. Almost 3 years old now, and already had to deal with it earlier this week as I store my Users folder on the F drive, and Windows was being slow (obviously having a hard time read/write to the drive) and then wouldn't let me log in (user login service failed the sign-in). Anyway, I fixed that and it seemed fine again but then the same stuff started happening again. Now I can't access Windows, (incl. safe mode, like before), and I'm running a debian live cd and I have this [screenshot](https://i.imgur.com/QVnZCv0.jpg) telling me the partition is misaligned by 3072 bytes. How can I 1. recover my data 2. fix my drive, if possible, and if it is worth fixing? I am definitely going to look into buying another drive after this...</TEXT>

Which is strange because A - I pay a monthly fee and B - I believe my free tier expired long ago. If someone could clarify what this actually means that'd be helpful too. Anyway, been looking into Azure to host the new dev/beta server, but was just wondering what other people use, and maybe they don't even use a separate box? I've found this [WP plugin](https://wordpress.org/plugins/sandbox/) that creates a sandbox on the existing live host. EDIT- I want to host it so my team can use it too.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>The storyline was mainly driven by Bucky and then Steve's relationship with him. Wider storyline of the accords. So up until Bucky's "bombing" it was more of an Avengers film I suppose, but thereon after it's centered mostly around Cap and Bucky. Bit of both then?</TEXT>

    <TEXT>https://imgur.com/a/1NpEF I noticed this last night, it seems the left half of the monitor has darker colours compared to the right, and it's particurlarly visible when f.lux is on, as seen in these images of steam (not great photos, but I hope I've pointed out the line where it happens, which is about halfway across the screen). Is this a monitor defect, should I be returning it or getting an RMA? It's not as noticable without flux/when its flux daytime.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Yup. [I have it now on the subreddit with dark theme!](https://imgur.com/xzvwc76) And yeah, I have exactly the problems you state. Steam client is what is in the picture... :/ Do you still have the new monitor then? Have you just gotten used to it by now? This is kind of annoying, and wish I had known about it before.</TEXT>

Downsides are, the battery menu is really crappy now, all the details from the apps are gone, and twilight can no longer apply its filter to the navigation bar and the notification shade! Can you believe it, it's pretty annoying. The in built comfort view is not enough for some people. Oh, and also, of course, the emojis.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Second viewing - I didn't mind the multiple threads or length of the film as much, I understand they needed quite a few threads to give characters a decent amount of screen time, and the Russos really did a good job considering (however, cap, bucky and Nat didn't get too much to do :( - especially bucky, but the Edinburgh scene was still great). It's excruciating watching this film again knowing what is coming at the end. Gamora dying still hurts the 2nd time, the music during that section is absolutely amazing. The jokes still damn good, the squidward one is far by my favourite. The forge scenes bored me first time, didn't mind them 2nd time because they are worth it in the end, when Thor arrives on earth and fucking kicks names and takes ass. Absolutely amazing, absolutely strongest avenger. And then The last act, holy fuck, it doesn't get any easier, I felt worse 2nd time round. Wanda and vision Vision dying twice (truly fucked in the whole film) "should have gone for the head" The ashes Fuck, still absolutely amazing on second viewing, magnificent piece of storytelling that somehow lived up to the hype. I just don't know how they can bring back the avengers that turned into ash in a satisfying, not disappointing way in the sequel.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>The score has been all I've been listening to since my first viewing... Favourites in no particular order: * Forge (Thor's entrance on Earth, BRING ME THANOS!!!) * Help Arrives (Sexy Bearded Cap in Waverley Station) * A Small Price (arrival on Vormir) - Even for You ([RIP Gamora](#spoiler)) * He Won't Come Out (Spiderman swinging from the bridge, for some reason not in the next track, Field Trip) * Every track after and including, I Feel You (or Get That Arm/I Feel You on the extended edition) - covering the best parts of the ending. Listening to the last few tracks reminded me that the dusting scenes were all musicless, something that I forgot about initially. Also, I kinda wish Old Tech was the last track on the OST. Question though: The extended edition includes a lot of extended tracks - could we be getting extended/deleted scenes for these parts?</TEXT>

    <TEXT>To put it bluntly, No(tch) to the G7. Not a fan of the design at all. However, there are a few things about it, that I wish the v30 had; I assume its releasing with oreo so therefore project treble will be enabled. And if you're super nitpicky about the LG OLED screens, the lcd on the g7 may be better for you. As for me, the only times I ever notice the non uniformity of the v30 screen is low light situations, when I'm looking at the phone in bed with all the lights off. Apart from that, the screen is pretty good, an amazing upgrade from my oneplus one. Do wish the front camera was better, everytime I need to use it I notice how bad it is.</TEXT>

    <DATE>2018-05-06 17:14:49</DATE>
    <TEXT>https://imgur.com/a/WN8Jhpo Cloudiness that is definitely not on top of the screen, but underneath a layer or something. There is a small micro scratch on the screen too, and this cloudiness that I can't wipe away with isopropyl alchohol or anything. Guy at the phone repair store said maybe it's steam or something that got trapped in the phone that got in through the charging port - i'm thinking maybe it got in through the scratch, unsure. First time I've owned a waterproof phone, so unsure whether it's do to with water or not? Any recommendations/ideas to fix this cloudy screen, and could I get this exchanged perhaps? First time I decided to not use a screen protector and this happens, serves me right I guess :( EDIT: More images - https://imgur.com/a/6eCYbNX 2nd EDIT: Outlined - https://imgur.com/a/k06Y6I3</TEXT>

    <TEXT>The coating we are referring to is the oleophobic coating right? I have definitely applied isopropyl to it before - so in theory the new coating should help it? I don't think it's the actual glass - I have put droplets of water on the screen, and where the smudging is - beads form a bit, but not as strong as on the outside of the smudge. So I think the coating has just been affected (hopefully anyway).</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Pretty horrible situation right now, site stopped working and reported that wp-config.php had gone missing. So the main site and admin panel were both inaccessible. Restored one from about a week ago but huge php errors appearing on both the site and admin panel, with a huge string of just digits appearing. What was the cause? How can I recover my site? Considering just wiping it and restoring content backups (themes, uploads, plugins) via UpdraftPlus. I installed 2 plugins 2 days ago and now this has happened, could it be one of them had malicious code? EDIT - [could be related?](https://wordpress.stackexchange.com/questions/195024/wp-config-php-being-deleted)</TEXT>

    <DATE>2018-10-04 15:42:09</DATE>
    <TEXT>Just wanted to see if anyone knows if there are any future updates soon. The latest update available for my V30 (H930, UK) is the May security patch (and it doesn't apply properly, but that's a different story). Phone has seen about a year of usage and I was big into the ROM flashing scene with my old OnePlus One and was thinking of getting back into it, but of course, if there is another big (8.1 I hope) or incremental official update coming on the horizon I may hold off for now. Personally I don't see LG giving the V30 Pie tbh (and I'm kind of not fussed about that since I don't like many of its features).</TEXT>

    <DATE>2019-03-13 09:59:36</DATE>
    <TEXT>Following on from my [post here](https://www.reddit.com/r/lgv30/comments/b09fk4/latest_update_downloaded_anyone_applied_it_h930/) about whether or not I should update, I did so before falling asleep last night and now my phone is nothing but a glorified media player. I cannot turn on wifi, mobile data, cannot make calls. My IMEI is unknown. My phone number is unknown. Have tried reinserting the SIM. Have tried rebooting. Mobile Networks in settings is blanked out and the option to turn on mobile data is greyed out too. Turning on wifi turns it off immediately with the toast notification: "Cannot search for all Wifi networks. Check SIM card or mobile network." A simple software update has done this? I've done security patches in the past and they never fucked up this badly! I knew having a gig update of security patches seemed fishy! Can't call LG Support obviously, lol, and their live chat is busy rn. so basically just sent them this post almost word for word. Has anyone had this problem before, and specifically after an update? I wonder if maybe my SIM has been fried or something, but Wi-Fi should still be able to at least turn on... Update- Rip. LG Support saying I will have to do a factory reset and see from there. Fannnntastic Update 2- Factory Reset did nothing. Waiting for LG to get back to me for a pickup time for my phone so they can repair it. Update 3 - SOLVED Thanks to this comment, https://www.reddit.com/r/lgv30/comments/b2es0t/v30_h930ds_is_now_receiving_januarys_security/eiui9bp/ thank you /u/jstubbs !!!</TEXT>

    <TEXT>No, UK model, UK based. Factory reset the phone as per LG Support's advice and it didn't work, like you predicted. Have to send it in now to support and get them to fix. (sigh) Unless I can flash the radio myself, does that involve any bootloader unlocking or anything? I'm pretty familiar with flashing etc as I had a OPO for 4 years flashing that to death.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Yeah I hear you. All that stuff about festering in your mind and affecting you for a long time resonates with me. Talking always definitely helps, and even though I hate the internet for a lot of things (the usual stuff it gets bad press for, and rightly so), the ability to talk about stuff anon without your brain making you think a certain way about a person just from the way they look or speak or behave - is a real real positive.  gt;but a lot of the time when I try to commiserate with them they shut me down because I don #8217;t  #8220;really #8221; know what it #8217;s like to be a full Asian in the West. Which is technically true... Yes I suppose you're right but at the same time that doesn't make your experiences or pain any less valid. I sympathise with you but obviously I can't emphathise and vice-versa. I'd recommend perhaps signing up to the subreddit's slack if you're looking for more people to confide in? It sounds excellent and I wish I could join, but alas I'm not half-Asian, perhaps /r/aznidentity will have something similar soon. I'm lucky in that I have a few select friends I can trust with this stuff, and I also went all out in a Medium post last summer just letting it all out there, so most people know what I'm about now. Unsure why it took me so long to open up, but honestly, you come to a point where you're so exhausted as you said, it gets draining, and then I just told myself - if anyone's going to take the piss then they're honestly not worth my time. Actually, tbh, going back to your point about "shutting you down", I'm sorry, that's utter shit. For example I once had a WM friend try and console me after a racist outburst by saying it was difficult for him in school cos he was made fun of for being so tall. Of course my initial reaction is "that's nothing like what I'm experiencing" but I still appreciate the intention, it's still a bad experience due to a difference. No, not the same thing, but I was not going to shut him down while he's trying to, y'know, empathise. There's absolutely nothing good that can come from that, so I'm not too happy that these people you speak of shut you down like that. (PS idk what i'm talking about it's 5am i've had no sleep :D )</TEXT>

    <TEXT>He lost his credibility as an Asian the moment he decided to post his travel vlog in Hong Kong mocking all the locals as if he was some sort of stereotypical regular white jock. Not to mention he's an all round cunt. Watch the content cop on him if you need more proof. Content involving this twat should be banned on Asian subreddits. Talk about being an Asian role model in the west, if this is what Asian boys are seeing growing up then God help us all.</TEXT>

    <DATE>2019-08-16 20:34:22</DATE>
    <TEXT>I know the airport seems much better now than it was earlier during the week, and from checking flightaware.com the specific flight I'll be taking, Cathay 216 has only been cancelled once. But a lot can happen in 2 weeks (or so), so I was just wondering if any travel insurance companies come to mind that might cover civil unrest. Alternatively do I even need to look at that particular policy or will cancellation cover/delayed depature normally have my back? Booked my flight in May just before all of this kicked off.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>You pay for the experience of being at the cinema with your friends and the audience it seems now, and just having a bigger screen, being in the complete dark and "forgetting the outside world" as my cinema puts it - wholly different from pirating films. So yeah. I'll go for big releases and for good times</TEXT>

    <TEXT>As most people have said, I use Package disabler to debloat and Vanced works fine unRooted. My biggest problem with rooting - is that the problem with banking apps not working if the device is rooted. (but I haven't tried Magisk etc recently) I don't know what the experience is with that now but that's the main reason I have against not rooting atm, maybe later down the line. And also stability + battery life is a concern too. And rooting would lead me back into trying out tons of different ROMs, which can be both a blessing and a curse! heh</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I was finally able to fix this by disabling the leftover firewall rule. https://www.reddit.com/r/halo/comments/e74b67/possible_solution_halo_mcc_for_pc_achievements/ Thank fuck it worked, after uninstalling every program with "spyware" in its name, reinstalling spybot antibeacon and making sure it applied default rules, uninstalling it, having a default host, flushing dns, reseting network adapters, etc. you name it. God what a journey this has been.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Yeah, in my ping command it resolves as [65.55.44.109](https://65.55.44.109) for me.I guess advice for anyone else who has this problem is to run ping [vortex.data.microsoft.com](https://vortex.data.microsoft.com) and see what it resolves the IP address as. And lo and behold once I removed that address from scope pinging still works fine.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Thinking about getting back into this game - the world itself was great and in terms of gameplay I didn't, and haven't since played anything like it (Tamer main). I have a vague idea of what I used to know, but can people give me a TLDR rundown of what's new since then? I remember leaving just as they were rolling out Valencia, I got to Altinova and couldn't get any further as it wasn't released at the time IIRC. For example I don't understand what Awakening or Succession are, and how you "get" them. Also, I'm fairly sure I used to own a house and maybe a pet? How do I find them? And what's the best armours now? And some good website resources? Finally game was becoming more and more P2W when I left, I assume it's gone full fledged P2W or Pay-4-Convenience and has been for a while now? Doesn't bother me too much as I was never looking to be competitive anyway.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Thanks a lot man! THis was really helpful and comprehensive. I thought the game was overwhelming back then, now it's like wow I'll probably take it at my own pace then - back then I got overwhelmed by the size and freqeuncy of updates so I won't let that dictate how I approach the game this time. Thanks for explaining awakening and succession, very useful to know about. I think awakening was the last thing I really took notice of before. The sea-faring stuff sounds extremely fun, what's it like in reality though? And any idea how much more of the map they're going to add/ how long until BDO EOL?</TEXT>

    <TEXT>~~Where are you getting the 24k value for a whole year from, are you going to be paying international fees?~~ EDIT- actually read the post fully, stupid me Meanwhile I would say, it depends, I did a year placement out at IBM (and yes, paid 1.6k fees instead of 9 for the year) and I definitely think it helped me with my hireability later on, and also helped me just gain technical and other random, useful knowledge with my current company (a lot of ex IBMers) But I've also heard of some students who were in my year prior to the year out who did work experience stints at very big companies and banks etc as summer placements etc, or before starting uni - I suppose if you feel confident/comfortable with spending your summers doing so you can gain experience that way if you didn't want to spend a whole year. They would have to be very good stints though and not be too short. Anyway, as other people have said, you can opt in or out of the year up to a point. I initially just enrolled for the 3 year and then chose to do a year out.</TEXT>

    <TITLE>Constant BSODs when idling</TITLE>
    <DATE>2020-04-25 14:36:11</DATE>
    <TEXT>Getting a hell of a lot of BSODs but they only seem to occur when I'm not really doing anything intensive or useful, and just when I'm generally idling or going through files. Basically not during gaming or anything like that. Got many wonderful BSOD variety error such as: * APC\_INDEX\_MISMATCH * KMODE\_EXCEPTION\_NOT\_HANDLED * DRIVER\_POWER\_STATE\_FAILURE * UNEXPECTED\_KERNAL\_MODE\_TRAP * SYSTEM\_SERVICE\_EXCEPTION and possibly more that have disappeared as BlueScreenView is just holding 5 dumps and the minidump folders only holds 5. Have tried memtesting my RAM and windows memory diagnostics found no problems. I used driver verifier and it DRIVER\_VERIFIER\_IOMANAGER\_VIOLATION BSOD'd with driver Wdf01000.sys. I will be resetting Windows (as I should have probably done when I migrated my Windows OS install from an SSD to my new Sabrent Rocket 1tb pcie4 NVMe) to see if that resolves these BSODs. If not, I might disconnect my 3TB drive that is failing as its Reallocated Sectors Count is Yellow in CrystalDiskInfo, as well as Current pending and uncorrectable sector count. Though I've had this plugged in for ages and these BSODs had not been happening before. Backblaze seems to be backing up files from that drive so maybe that might be a trigger, unsure. So really this post is just for reference atm and I will report back really and hopefully the fresh Windows OS reset resolves the mystery issue(s) behind this all. Here's the 5 most recent dumps I have, 2 of them with no errors and 1 of them being the driver verfier BSOD.[https://www.dropbox.com/sh/xajphy2s0dw2593/AACZe\_\_AJ62FSrqniEnxhQmIa?dl=0](https://www.dropbox.com/sh/xajphy2s0dw2593/AACZe__AJ62FSrqniEnxhQmIa?dl=0) Solution:Dodgy CPU. Set voltage offset to +0.012V for now. See /r/techsupport live chat for amazing help, couldn't have got to this solution without the IRC</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Thanks. For hardware I haven't installed anything new for a while apart from fans and RGB strips. I uninstalled synergy and sharemouse and a BSOD hasn't happened for a while so maybe that was the cause. I hope I don't have to rebuild the PC. My PC works fine for the most part, it's not like the BSODs are stopping me from starting up. It's just been up for a day continously so I think maybe the worst has passed. Will still do a Windows refresh anyway.</TEXT>

    <TITLE>UK Asians... Where you at? You're not alone.</TITLE>
    <DATE>2020-05-03 02:34:52</DATE>
    <TEXT>Hi guys. I've notice there's a lot of Asian American content online and that's great. Just wondering if there's anything like nextshark or hate is a virus for the UK. Just anything. In light of recent events I think I've just come to the conclusion that we need a platform and just a voice in the UK, because I would've loved to have known growing up that trying to be white and rejecting my heritage and culture was a huge mistake. I would've loved to have known that my self internalised racism shouldn't have to be a part of me. I would've loved to have stopped being paranoid about every white person I see, frantically analysing them up thinking are they a racist? Can I talk to this person without being abused? Basically living in fear... I feel like this is the most appropriate Reddit sub to post on. I really wanna start building a platform for BBC(British born Chinese) and all British east Asians just so we have a place to feel "alike" and not alone, a place where maybe we can bring to light some of the stupid, hurtful verbal abuse we suffer and no doubt suffer more now than ever... Idk I get so angry before going to bed as my mind is able to rest from the hecticness of the day and then I get so fucking angry about how the world is right now and just want to stop the status quo of self-hating, low confidence, low self respect and low self-esteem aura and portrayal we get... Feel free to remove if not appropriate. It's 3.30am so this probably doesn't make for the best reading. All the best and stay safe, wherever you are in the world. Ps Rina sawayama ~~is great~~ EDIT- is okay</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Exactly my sentiment. Oh god a UK Chinese facebook page. Can you provide a link? I can only imagine what recent posts on that page are like right now. I was part of one a while back but it was just full of videos and rubbish like most of Facebook. We're probably talking about the same page.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>No, sorry, but I assume you're on this sub for a reason right? Obviously the more people that are aware of this sentiment the better, and allies are always welcome. I don't want to offend or sound like a whiner, but imo I feel like British Pakinstani / British Indians are just more "accepted" as British. I don't know whether my viewpoint is totally skewed being based on personal experience but it just seems that way. Of course you have absolute idiots who will still be racist towards you but I think generally, larger communities means just a feeling of belonging at least which is something I wish I had growing up... Idk if you would agree... I can probably talk more sense later on.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Yeah I remember the one I was in was a lot of posts about Hong Kong. And yeah I use Facebook container on Firefox. Is it me or does the majority age group just seem very middle aged? (I feel this is the vast majority of Facebook users in general nowadays anyway, as I know I and a lot of people my age have basically curbed their Facebook usage - excluding Messenger). Seems like a place to not really "rock the boat" and discuss the state of play in the UK. What do you mean by Geoexpat however, sorry. I'm trying to work my head around this last statement but still can't. And that's I guess, interesting. I would've expected maybe some posts about racial abuse experiences. Or maybe they just aren't posting about it.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Yeah, that's my view on it. More ingrained in British history, part of the empire, East Indian Trading Company etc. Indian/Pakistani crickteers in the England team. Tikka Masala being the nation's favourite dish at one point (no source on this but pretty sure it happened, probably some survey done by a paper). The first primary school I attended I had quite a lot of Muslim classmates and I remember them getting days off for Ramadan :D apparently that doesn't happen anymore when I talk to people. But as part of that I remember learning about like 4 Religions, Islam, Sikhism, Hinduism as well as Christianity (notice no Buddhism or Taoism or Shinto)... Also the Chancellor and the Home Secretary are of Indian heritage. Mosques and Sikh Temples built. Riz Ahmed is a great British Pakistani actor who was in Venom and the classic Four Lions. I remember seeing this guy (Ajay Chhabra) in Basil Brush, Citizen Khan (which I hear is not very well received) a show that airs on the BBC... I don't wanna sound like a salty boy trying to list every single South Asian thing he saw growing up but that's just what I can name off the top of my head at the moment. And of course I'm not saying all of this has been plain sailing for you guys. I'm sure 9/11 and the 00s with the whole war on terror was not a great time to be British Pakistani or British Indian, I'm sure many feared for their livelihoods. And the EDL, BNP, etc just yeah... I think we both know about the extremist idiots in this country. I just think there's these very unique and special qualities that have been brought over into British culture that not many could live without. Now I'm not saying that that level of culture integration is what needs to happen with East Asian culture, I'm not sure about that. Just that by doing so, it's become normal; there was surely a point in time where it was far from that... IMO Chinese culture in Britain goes as far as Chinatown, Chinese takeaways, which people affectionally call "chinkies" and cheap electronics on Amazon. Oh and martial arts clubs. And then Japanese you have like the weebs, anime, food, Korea, K-pop culture... and then just generally food and restaurants and takeaways for the rest of East Asia. idk ... that's probably it. Barely any representation on TV past Sandra Oh and Benedict Wong... I can't really think of anyone else. That girl (Susie Ma) off the apprentice one season. Sorry for the shit prose, I tend to just rant and brainsplat my thoughts when it comes to this topic</TEXT>

    <TEXT>DId the RAM test and memtest (not memtest+) and ran that overnight. 4 passes, no errors. Tried upgrading the bios. Nothing. Might look at resetting the battery. Annoyingly I just did PC spring cleaning before the BSODs started appearing more and more. During Windows install. Like 5 mins after boot. I was on the subreddit IRC last night and found someone with very similar problems and BSODs and with the same Ryzen 5 3600 chip. Then found this [megathread](https://community.amd.com/thread/244029?messageTarget=all amp;start=150 amp;mode=comments) on the AMD forums with people experiencing the same problem. I'm convinced its the CPU.</TEXT>
