    <TEXT>" ## [Jannifer](https://forums.nexusmods.com/index.php?/user/46421-jannifer/) Before you start a new game, disable all your mods except SkyUI, USSEP, RaceMenu, LAL (if you're using it for that character) and anything you need for character creation. #160; Go in, create your character, then re-enable your mods after you get into the main game. #160; Ditch fpsboost.esp, it's unnecessary, ditto allinonefpsfix.esp. #160; I would suggest going through the descriptions on your mods' Nexus pages to check for incompatibilities. #160; Tools are good, but your own knowledge is better. #160; Take notes if you need to. #160; For example, check that No More Ugly Effects is compatible with ELFX. One more warning -- do not under any circumstances make changes to your SSE.ini file unless you know exactly what you're doing and why. #160; If a mod tells you to make specific changes, that's one thing. #160; If a post on the forums says something like "This worked for me," ignore it. #160; There's some really bad information floating around out there, so leave your .ini alone for now." Thanks to jannifer for the advice! worked a charm!</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Actually the developer is making good progress on the current game, Divine Arms: Origins (a prequel of sorts to Divine arms. DA:O is about 40-50% done. Recently hes made fast progress for a (mostly) one man team. (animation is usually out sourced) DA = Divine arms, DA:O = Divine arms: Origins As for DA being on hold: "The production of Divine Arms (DA for short) has been halted due to some issues with Patreon regarding the content of the game. Production is scheduled to be halted until ViperV has found a suitable replacement for patreon. In the meantime ViperV is working on Divine Arms: Origins, a prequel to Divne Arms. Thank you for understanding. " That is the official reason for the games halt in development (there are other reasons ie. Issues with animators, patreon police ect) Thats the general gist of things.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I don't even want to bother anymore. Why cant people just accept the fact that its just an image that contains a mindless joke meant to make people exhale a little air out of their nose. Its just exhausting and depressing to see people repeatedly message me about how wrong I am and how little I know. Like cmon, just laugh or scroll past.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Rysen 5 3600 + 16Gb DDR4 3200 + GeForce GTX 1660ti @ 1440p is a pretty good combo. 40~144 fps depending on the game (running on high-very high) [this is almost exactly what im running rn, except I have a R7 3700x and 32gb DDR4] I dunno about the value as of right now (5th, Oct 2020) But before the 3080 launched it was a pretty ideal setup for cheap.</TEXT>
