    <TEXT>I have never had any issues with Binance so far... Only issue I have is that it doesn't hold all the coins I'd like to buy from there  #128522; I think without verification you can withdraw coins for value up to 1BTC if you need more you'll have to get verified. My ID photo is really old - like long to short hair old and it worked like a charm  #128522;</TEXT>

    <TEXT>If you decided to sell two of them(I hope to reinvest not to sell for fiat) and you are looking for short term gains I would exchange BTC to some altcoin of your choice :) and for LTC and DASH I'll leave that one to you as I think they both have huge potential but again it might be more long term investment then short term gains.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>This is just my opinion - LTC is a great coin( I hold none atm ), it's fast, reliable, jumped a lot lately, managed to keep a decent value and I can only see it going up again. As BTC slows down and decreases in market cap it's only logical that crypto silver will grab a piece of that pie. I might be completely wrong but that's just my opinion. Anyhow if you feel better about DASH then follow your guts :)</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Don't think anyone would be able to buy games without already being part of the crypto game. Imagine game costs 10 #8364; - to change 10 #8364; to ICX you have to buy btc/eth/ltc pay fee on let's say coinbase of 1 #8364; for transaction and whatever fee you have to pay for Visa transaction e.g. .5 #8364; this is already 15% of 10 #8364; down, send it off to an exchange you get ripped off there, change it to ICX you are ripped off again. Don't get me wrong this is the way to move towards mass adoption but it's not really an easy thing for newcomers to do without actually loosing money in the first place. Correct me if I am wrong of course!  #128522;</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Other than "just" fun, I play RPGs because it somehow manages to draw you into it's world, present you with different sets of values and allow you to work hard to be as good as you want to be. RPGs nowadays have great storylines, character designs and amazing gameplay. As much as playing games in general is fun there's also so much more to games than just fun.Just remember how you felt when hearing Ori and the blind forest story or how you felt while playing Journey at that final snow slope where you fell down and couldn't do anything to help and then finally you were brought back and pulled into this majestic final step in your journey. RPGs are so much more than "just fun".</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Hi there Wild Paprika... Like the content :) There seems to be an echo in your sound all the time which gets a bit annoying over time especially on headphones. I'd also add that in some instances you might want to speed up the narration just a little bit and also add more of the gameplay or other videos, images to cut long scenes of your avatar animation it feels a bit odd to stare at the animated avatar for so long while he's only moving his head slightly( but that could also just be me and maybe not being a huge fan of this types of videos) :) Hope that helps and good luck! :)</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I can't comment the gameplay as I am not a huge fan of subnautica even tho its a great game :) But I'd say better prepare for the intro... Maybe repeat the intro couple of times until you get it right :) Sometimes it can be funny if you say something wrong but it felt like you weren't prepared for the intro at the beginning of the video :) Also don't shy to scream and shout when you get scared :P Good luck with your channel :)</TEXT>

While Spellbreak covers all the basics of BR game like flying from the sky, gathering equipment and slaying all your enemies to be the last mage standing, there's something very different about Spellbreak. Gameplay mechanics is what separates Spellbreak from all other BR games. Combat in this game is so complex and interesting that you simply have to give this game a go. Just the pure joy of managing to exile someone even if you've lost the game is incredible! Thanks so much for tuning in and I'll see you in the next one :)</TEXT>

    <TEXT>You already know what Hades is so I am going to spre you reading that again! However one thing I have to say is that Hades has blown my mind  #128522; I am not a huge fan of hack and slash or dungeon crawler games but hades is a lot different  #128076; #128076; hope you'll like the video! And do tell me which upgrades I should've picked instead of ones I've went for initially  #128522;</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I'd say one thing you could do is cut between "boring" parts where you are driving around and not much is happening or at least speed those bits a bit more :) One more thing I'd suggest is just talking a bit more and decreasing game volume while increasing your voice volume as in some of the parts it's a bit hard to hear you talking while thigns are happening in the background</TEXT>

    <TEXT>How you doing guys, ItsTom here and it's been couple days since amazon announced Luna cloud gaming service and I wanted to sit on this announcement to figure out if it's actually good or bad. I am hoping that this is finally a step in a good direction for cloud gaming! There's so much potential with cloud gaming that I can't wait to see if amazon can pull this off. And remember Amazon holds the largest share in cloud market... I think this would be an amazing way to get people with lower budgets to play triple A titles with low input latency. But we will have to wait and see how it all plays out since Stadia wasn't that greatly received and a lot of publsihers pulled out, hopefully that doesn't happen to Amazon. One thing I am afraid is that this service will see sing ups only when they launch games and loads of cancellations few weeks later. It might be a big struggle for Amazon to retain their audience.  #8203; Anyhow join me in my video as I discuss pros and cons and why I think this is a step in the right direction!</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I've recently discussed this in a video on my youtube channel([ItsTom](https://youtu.be/GJYphnoASQw)) but I'll add my 2 cents here as well... I personally believe we are not going to see a huge surge of people jumping into cloud gaming boat at once. We are more likely to see parts of communities jumping into it. First group of people that will be jumping into cloud gaming will definitely be people that may not be able to afford expensive hardware to run all these new games. This group of people is the type of gamers that don't mind lower graphics quality nor to they mind 15-30ms latency input as they'd most likely be playing single player games anyway... After that initial group jumps on board(which some of them already have) we could see a group of people above them(casual gamers who buy consoles and latest hardware several months if not years after initial release) recognising that they could spend less on playing games through cloud services... If you look at Amazons revenue model which is subscription based and if their Ubisoft channel will be anywhere around 20-30$ a month we are talking about realistically saving 100s of $$$ for all the games you get to play. Just new Assassins Creed and Far Cry alone will cost you 120$ meaning playing these two games through cloud service will save you around 100$ :) I doubt we'll see that final group of gamers(hardcore gamers) jumping on board any time soon as for us it's not only the console or the game but it's part of our DNA or just part of who we are to be playing on xbox, playstation or pc. :) But I am pretty sure that if anyone can deliver a good experience with cloud gaming it's definitely the biggest cloud giant in the world Amazon(AWS) :)</TEXT>

    <TEXT>How you doing guys ItsTom here and couple of days ago amazon announced it's cloud gaming service Luna. I wanted to sleep it off for a day or two to go through my opinions and discuss it with myself if I think this is good or bad. In this video you'll hear me talking about pros and cons of Luna and cloud in general. Overall my opinion is that cloud gaming will be something important in gaming future so any new products and improvements to existing services is very well welcomed :) Great way for people that are not able to purchase expensive hardware and consoles to play AAA titles for a low price. Thanks for watching guys and I'll see you in the next one :)</TEXT>

Also make sure to decrease music volume and increase your voice volume as music takes over your voice in several spots :)</TEXT>

    <TEXT>How you doing guys ItsTom here and I wanted to share my thoughts on Amazon Luna today :) Amazon announced Luna couple days ago and it seems that they could be bringing better performance than competitors but we'll have to wait and see. On the other hand I believe cloud gaming is a great way for people with lower financial power to play AAA titles for a fair price with potentially weaker graphics etc whilst still being able to play without latency issues etc.  #8203; Hope you enjoy this one and I'll see you in the next one!</TEXT>
