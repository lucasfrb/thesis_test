    <TEXT>What was the event? I'm visiting family in Margate for the week in two weeks and I really don't fancy a day on this beach tbh. Are more rubbish bins needed? Or regular collections from the 'busy' bins? Where I live we just take a black sack with us on trips out and people are proud to not leave a scrap of rubbish. I can't imagine the mentality of people who have so little self respect and so little respect for their environment that they just do this en masse. It's not even individuals from the looks of things, it's the whole event. Fucking awful people.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Not being able to get home. Hear me out. I have recurring nightmares of not being able to get home, being stranded without a way of getting home or any of my stuff (phone, cash, keys). It happens in all scenarios but it's basically the same story. I've been stranded in Victorian London Train Stations, sports clubs in Maidstone, last night I was stranded in the middle of 'the troubles' in Ireland and this is why I'm awake at 5am on Reddit. They're not a bit funny just terrifying. I'm sure there's some deep rooted psychological cause.</TEXT>

I got him some tins but he eschewed them for the instant powder variety. At Christmas he put a whole small christmas pudding in the bottom of the pyrex jug and then filled it to the top with custard. I had this bf once and we went out for an Indian meal. We ordered a main and two sides each. When they arrived he gathered his 3 dishes around and tipped all three of them in their entirety onto his plate and stirred and stirred till it was a massive taupe coloured mountain. Nothing was distinguishable. Everyone was looking at him as he stirred away. I'm not a food gatekeeper, live and let live, but it was embarrassing.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Thanks for such a comprehensive answer. I'm in UK so I'm going to have to search around a little to source these (worth it though) but the KKW do ship to UK. Thanks again for this, I will report back. I think I've been going wrong by gradually buying cheaper ones to 'try out' because of the money I've already wasted. Edit: I'm definitely going to try the Farsali primer as well. I could do with a little 'blurring'.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>The Hairy Bikers madras recipe is the best Indian curry I've ever made, it was restaurant level, so good. With Thai curries I do what all the locals do and use Mae Ploy but I pimp it up with fresh ginger, fresh lemongrass, an extra splash of fish sauce and, most important of all, fresh kaffir lime leaves. Unbelievable how much difference those lime leaves make.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Same here. I have a ton of old family photos dating back to the late 1800s, all set in Cornwall where my family are from. I divided them (roughly) into eras and scanned the 1800s - 1950s batch for future generations. Nobody even wants the digital ones, let alone the hard copies. As though they can't spare 500mb space on their 2tb hard drives. My family has an interesting history within the context of us being 100% Cornish on both sides as far back as I can trace (and [therefore officially recognised as a protected ethnic minority in UK](https://www.gov.uk/government/news/cornish-granted-minority-status-within-the-uk)).

    <TEXT>Not as much as I'd like to. Mainly we buy skirt steak from our amazing butcher as I like to make proper pasties. I'll slow cook a casserole or a steak chilli where I can make a cheaper cut of beef become tender. A quality roast beef joint is expensive though so it's more of a treat. Same with lamb, it's crazy expensive for two of us. I'm all about the slow cooked shoulder of pork. Slow cook a massive one ( #163;4-5 ish) and you have varied food for days - pulled pork roast dinner, tacos, stir fry, pork fried rice etc.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>So many things, here are a few: When I split up with my husband (who was rich) she invited him, our children and his new girlfriend for Christmas, knowing I would be alone. Like I didn't exist. When we had a huge custody battle (he snatched my children, took me 4 months to get them back) she told massive lies about me (I was a heroin addict - I don't even know what Heroin looks like or how to take it, all I did was the odd joint but she considers them the same). All disproven in court, even my ex said that just wasn't true. When I was a teenager and beginning to date if they rang the house she'd just tell them not to call again (no mobiles then). Just a random selection, there are worse things she did and pettier things. Honestly I could go on and on. I didn't stop my children seeing her, they got to decide. They did decide in their late teens when she started her shit on them, telling my son in public that he was fat). Now they have no time for her. Haven't spoken since 1998, not a word, and I never will.</TEXT>

If my butcher doesn't have it then they offer flank or blade, but [they're not really the same but they have similar qualities](https://www.goodfoodstories.com/hanger-skirt-flank-flatiron-steaks/).

I found a brand that are really good, and no more expensive than the shit brand. The only way I can find them to order more is to go back to my original order and re-order from there. They don't appear in my search results even when I'm typing the EXACT item title/description. Yet the shitty 'mystic moments' brand STILL appears almost exclusively on the first few pages of any search. Same with skincare. All these weird, unknown brand miracle 'serums' with thousands of five star 'this is a miracle' reviews and it's just a bottle of crappy nothing. I get 'caught out' a lot less lately due to painstakingly combing and analysing the reviews.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Honestly I can't imagine them being wasteful. I used to make pickles etc. in them but now my kids are grown up I just pickle what's left in the garden in Autumn. I've had them years and the only cost is replacing the rubber seals every couple of years. I could understand your point if they were plastic or something non-recyclable, but glass is very eco friendly. Glass will unlikely pollute the environment or affect human health and thus can easily be reused and recycled. Glass is widely accepted as a recyclable material internationally. Used glass is often recycled and turned into bottles elsewhere in the world. Certainly in Europe we consider it preferable to plastic and if it lasts for years in the home it's hardly damaging to the environment. https://www.foodbev.com/news/75-of-consumers-see-glass-as-most-eco-friendly-packaging/ TLDR: I disagree with more or less everything you've said.</TEXT>

During the Great Depression she worked for the Farm Security Administration documenting the plight of the unemployed, homeless and migrant laborers.

From handwritten by my grandma, ones typed on an old Adler manual typewriter from office colleagues in the 1970s, the coronation chicken recipe from Buckingham Palace (friend's husband was a chef there), some written by friends long gone, some favourites written out by my children that were their 'specialities' growing up, my first husband's ale fondue recipe.

    <TEXT>And the tricks that some of them pull. I got gifted a free year of Apple TV when I bought a new iPad (for the grandchildren). Every other thing on there, apart from their half a dozen flagship shows, is "How to watch this", which translates to how much you have to pay. No warning or section for what is included, just tries to suck you in. Amazon Prime, which I get with my firestick has a particularly nasty little trick of letting you watch a few seasons and then randomly wanting  #163;2.50 per episode for a 24 episode season. Yeah, I'm not about to pay over  #163;50. So I bung it on my Plex server, takes minutes, and nobody's going to suddenly withdraw it.</TEXT>

Edit: it's a derivation of 'my handsome'. Honestly it's literally the most common form of addressing friends, family (especially children) and lovers. Also common is 'my lover' which doesn't actually mean my physical lover, more a term of endearment. When men are talking about other men they call them matey, pronounced 'madey'.</TEXT>
