    <TEXT>I checked on their twitter and so far it seems that they do not have the home video rights for this release, only for a theatrical run. It seems so odd though to do a restoration like that and not have it be in preparation for the added income of a physical release. Maybe they are still in negotiations and just can #8217;t confirm it yet? I hope that #8217;s the case, because I would love to upgrade all my Satoshi Kon films.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I pick up used criterion DVDs at my local record shop for $1-$4 to see if I like the film. This isn #8217;t super common, but I can pick up a few titles a month. Otherwise, I go with blu ray. It #8217;s just superior audio and visuals. If I really love a dvd I got, I #8217;ll upgrade to blu ray.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I finally read the first three volumes of **Silver Spoon** and I love this series so much. Also read the first volume of **Delicious in Dungeon**, very much enjoyed it. I just got a pretty big delivery from Rightstuf's Yen press sale so there's a lot more to read this week! :D</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Usually when a new series is announced, I'll read a few chapters online. If I like those, I'll order the physical release for the first volume and go from there. If I don't like the online chapters, I drop it. Otherwise, I always wait and get the physical release. I feel like I get a way more enjoyable experience with a physical release vs digital.</TEXT>

    <TITLE>Haul from record shop, CD Trader. They repriced a ton of their used Blu Rays so most of these were $4. Was very excited to find a copy of The Incredibles with the old cover for under $15. Really don #8217;t like the current one, and the old one has been extremely difficult to track down for a good price.</TITLE>

    <TEXT>Yes, it #8217;s on Ventura. I actually don #8217;t know on the 4Ks because they didn #8217;t have any I could see for sale, but they might just have them located somewhere else. I didn #8217;t ask because I #8217;d found enough movies and didn #8217;t need the temptation. I did see a couple behind the counter that they were gonna put out though.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I #8217;m not 100% sure because they repriced the whole section for the most part, but they may have been just trying to clear stock. I don #8217;t think brand new intakes will be that cheap. They do reprice blu rays that have been their awhile over time, maybe they just did it all at once.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I agree they are definitely overpriced, but I can #8217;t really find them under $15 at stores so it #8217;s the best pricing I #8217;ve found not online. I basically just go through the blu rays and pull out the $15 titles and pick from there. Luckily they do have a really nice selection in that price range. The really popular ones are always $25 used, which is pretty annoying. I #8217;ve even found one for $10 before on a normally $40 film so sometimes you get lucky.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>If you want a local store, this place is probably 30min outside LA, but they have the best Criterion selection outside Barnes  amp; noble and Amoeba. All their used criterion range between $16-$20 usually. It #8217;s nearly always $20 used. They usually tend to have a lot of box sets too. They also have criterions new, but I always grab their used stuff. It #8217;s called CD Trader and it #8217;s a small record shop in Tarzana. The guys that work there are pretty helpful too.</TEXT>
