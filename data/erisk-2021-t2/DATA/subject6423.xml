    <TEXT>What i say to my partner all the time is: just think of how much you like her and how badly you want it right now You don't have to bring out her brat all the time You can just act like the dom you are and you know she what you to be And talk about it with her is also always something good</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Hey there, First things first, how are you feeling rn? If you wanna talk to me about being scared, feel free to send me a message Now lets get to the point I think you should talk to him how you felt, about being scared, and also about the look he gave you, bdsm is supposed to be secure and respectful above all else, fun, yes, but you also need to feel good, no matter if you "put youself in that situation", we all do (i'm a sub myself), but you need to feel okay About your partner, maybe he held too strong or in the wrong way, it can be dangerous, one thing that works out for me is way the person hold my neck and presses mostly on the sides not so much on the middle (idk if i made myself clear) Anyway, stay safe, hope i helped a little</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Hello there In many ways i'm really similar to your GF, actually i've joke about it with my bf because we are making 7mo today Anyway, I think the best way for you to support her is to give her the space she's craving, try to support that, say that you're there for anything and make small daily checks about if she's okay, but also give her time, those things are difficult But she wants to maintain a romantic relationship? I was confused on that part About triggers, idk about her, but my ex boyfriend was really aggressive so the slightly raise of voice makes me burst into tears Not sure what you meant by open communication Hope i helped in some way, not sure if i answered the questions properly</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Hey guys, i'm (cis female, 20yo) so happy i found that subreddit because i'm a little bit confused. So, i'm in a relationship with a cis gender male for almost a year now. Initially, i remember wanting and asking him to have a threesome, with a male, but it could be a female. He was okay with the female part, we never did it but he said he was interested. I have already kissed 2 girls before, one was in a "truth or dare" and the other one was my best friend. Both was horrible experiences, i thought the female kiss was too "delicate" (idk how to explain it). But now, i was watching porn and i feel the desire of doing some things that i don't know if i am allowed to post in here and not be NSFW, and idk if i'm bi. Please help me And if i said something that has offended some of you i'm so sorry</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I am so sorry to hear that, this is so messed up, what you can do though is try to be as sensible as possible and very empathetic. Look for some good therapists in the area and present them to her, but let her have the last call about it, but make sure they're are of confidence. You are both very young, so i want to know, does her parents know about it? How would they pay for a therapist? Hope she is okay. Also don't know if she will want to be in a mental health institution so close after getting out of one, try to get her mind out of this, play some games, go on dates (if you can). If you need anything message me, i was really touched by that story</TEXT>

Try to confort her as you can, ask what she dreamed about, give some hugs and don't question too much. Just try to take care of her how you can, and if its too much, i advice you to go get some therapy as well. Do you live with her? Or does she lives with her parents?</TEXT>

    <TITLE>Allo and Ace relationship: how can I as Allo make my Ace boyfriend feel okay</TITLE>
    <DATE>2020-07-15 15:25:32</DATE>
    <TEXT>Hello everyone, i (F, 20 yo, bisexual) am in a 1 year long term relationship with my (M 20 yo probably ace) boyfriend, and after doing a research he thinks he may be ace, mostly because he doesn't seek sex, the initiative comes from myself a lot. Anyway, he is not sure and thinking "he's an impostor" and things like that, so he is very confused and insecure. I do have a really high sex drive, and asked him if i could only post some nudes and get compliments, because i was feeling really insecure too, as my self esteem is very connected to my body. Needless to say, he felt more insecure. But i don't know what to do, i love him so much, but sex is a thing i can't live without, i tried, but after one week i get or sad or really horny. Any help can do it, just please say something and feel free to message me. Ps: Forgot to say he is not sex repulsed, but i really enjoy the initiative thing and be praised haha</TEXT>

And I know he is feeling insecure and I feel so bad for wanting sex when he is being all cuddly and sweet. I want him to be happy and make he feel secure, he is feeling that he is not enough and that I might leave him. I feel so guilty for posting those photos or even masturbating, but i don't know what to do. I'm nearly crying here. If I may ask, what did your wife done? And you? How you accepted it?</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Hey, so I post nude pictures on gone wild, not in this profile, and I got myself thinking why I do that I think is because everytime I posted something or even did something (like drama classes, singing classes, gynastics, dancing classes etc etc) I never had so much popularity than posting naked pics. And that got me thinking, if the world was less sexist and didn't objetificate women so much, would I be able to get more upvotes on drawings I could post or poems?</TEXT>

    <TEXT>The broken pyramid: means all the plans and hopes for this year that was broken by the isolation (interships, courses, studies, friendships beginning) The sun: the pyramid is being break by the burning sun, it can both be the "unstopability" of the virus, and the burning emotions inside me, my intense form of feeling, that sometimes mess up with my planning The moon: it means my tendency to move away from the things I feel deeply, the sun is opposite to the moon, and that moon is crying blood that is falling in the broken pyramid, thats because the pull away from things often too literally "wear out" my possibilities. It is crying because the pain from being away from the things I would love if I did not fear them, comes over from my eyes, the emotion is too strong to remain far away. The cactus: Is almost one of my signatures, I feel myself as a cactus, again the feeling of pushing away things I love, but with a lot of water inside me (feelings) - I often use hedgehogs as well, due to it fluffly belly but the back full of thorns</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Analysis The broken pyramid: means all the plans and hopes for this year that was broken by the isolation (interships, courses, studies, friendships beginning) The sun: the pyramid is being break by the burning sun, it can both be the "unstopability" of the virus, and the burning emotions inside me, my intense form of feeling, that sometimes mess up with my planning The moon: it means my tendency to move away from the things I feel deeply, the sun is opposite to the moon, and that moon is crying blood that is falling in the broken pyramid, thats because the pull away from things often too literally "wear out" my possibilities. It is crying because the pain from being away from the things I would love if I did not fear them, comes over from my eyes, the emotion is too strong to remain far away. The cactus: Is almost one of my signatures, I feel myself as a cactus, again the feeling of pushing away things I love, but with a lot of water inside me (feelings) - I often use hedgehogs as well, due to it fluffly belly but the back full of thorns</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Hey, I think I'll be the different here, well, I am the allosexual girlfriend, and dude, that has been tough. A whole lot of crying and long conversations. The thing is: I feel weird af, when we do have sex, in the beggining but also now, I thought that he was doing more of a favor for me than we actually had intimacy. Also, I couldn't stop thinking he never felt anything (he found out he was ace after 1 year relationship). I am constantly afraid of saying I miss sex drive and sex, because I don't want him to feel guilty, invalidated and/or that he owns me something. We discussed about opening the relationship or breaking up, but honestly, I only want him, I feel safe with him, and love him so much. But I won't lie to you, it is tough and exausting, but now is getting easier, and it's awesome, we love each other very much.</TEXT>
