    <TITLE>Were Master Chief's "moon jumps" ever explained in lore?</TITLE>
    <DATE>2020-09-02 09:26:40</DATE>
    <TEXT>At least in CE, Halo 2 and 3 Master Chief ascends and descends in a very delayed manner, as if the gravity affected him differently (Halo 4 is less exaggerated as also 5). May be a game design feature to accommodate for the gamepad. As noted in the title, resembles jumping on the surface of the moon a lot.</TEXT>

    <TEXT> gt; It's reasonable to assume that Master Chief could jump extremely high- he is wearing powered armor. Sure, this was never unclear. One of the only real changes in OSDT was the jump height.  gt;while fighting aliens in slightly lower gravity. Actually, do the enemies have the same velocity as Chief? I'm now starting to remember Brutes being thrown, but not killed by explosives having clear deceleration in their arc. Likely affects the units jumping off from the covenant dropships as well.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I searched for a BTB game and was placed into a capture-the-flag match -- I prefer only playing CTF when explicitly searching as the mode requires so much thought in order to be effective and likely can heavily benefit from communication and playing in a dedicated group. The maps are also best learned (first played) elsewhere. BTB fiesta also mixes styles if I recall correctly, and personally I don't get much long-term enjoyment out of random weapons.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>In Halo 5 on the "swamp-like" interior map (I wasn't able find its name) there are at least two designated "shotgun-camping" spots, a shipyard container and a geometrically similar corner with a cage on its other side, from where you human players shoot out. In my last game the latter had six players, three standing on the shoulders back agains the wall. How the other Halo titles fare? Reach still had exploitable spots when the game launched in MCC and I don't know if 343 fixes legacy bugs some players may see as features.</TEXT>

For video games, Mobygames is the most comprehensive database, but I found no established data-import tool [by searching](https://github.com/search?q=mobygames amp;type=) and one promising necessitates requesting an API key. Discogs certainly has a suitable tool available, but I don't have much records. Would it be fine to to just scan and copy the EANs to a text file, waiting for to finish the project later? I may be able to use [the Worldcat database](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/WorldCat) for instance over scraping Amazon store pages or similar.</TEXT>

    <TITLE>Is there a comprehensive list of media domains?</TITLE>
    <DATE>2020-09-05 08:46:49</DATE>
    <TEXT>I realized that I essentially never view any video (or play audio) in browser, Youtube I watch via Newpipe (on mobile) or mpv (youtube-dl the latter relies on supports thousands of websites). Firefox's "stop autoplay" feature doesn't prevent buffering and I frequently see data being download in streaming video players so many sites use on seemingly any page. Youtube is easily taken care of by blocking `googlevideo.com` and `youtube.com` (outside of this domain, if you don't use https://github.com/iv-org/invidious) to kill the embeds. `spotify.com` also appears to be used often and you can't play anything without an account and DRM enabled. [Jwplayer has their own support page](https://support.jwplayer.com/faqs/which-ip-addresses-or-domains-can-i-add-to-an-allow-list). Blocking all major media domains would be extremely useful on mobile where battery life and data usage are a concern. Sadly blocking third-party content causes too much of a breakage to be truly viable in my opinion, especially due to CDNs.</TEXT>
