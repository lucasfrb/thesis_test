    <TITLE>(Spoilers Extended) Why  #8220;A Man Without Honor #8221; 02 x 07 is hugely important to that final scene with Brienne and Jaime.</TITLE>
    <DATE>2019-05-07 22:56:18</DATE>
    <TEXT>Brienne:  #8220;They #8217;re going to destroy that city - you know they will #8221; Jamie:  #8220;Have you ever run away from a fight? #8221; Brienne:  #8220;You #8217;re not like your sister - you #8217;re not. You #8217;re better than she is. You #8217;re a good man, and you can #8217;t save her. You don #8217;t need to die with her. Stay here. Stay with me. Please. Stay. #8221; Jamie:  #8220;You think I #8217;m a good man. I pushed a boy out of a tower window, crippled him for life - for Cersei. I strangled my cousin with my own hands - just to get back to Cersei. I would have murdered every man, woman and child in Riverrun - for Cersei. She #8217;s hateful - and so am I. #8221; I think it #8217;s important to point out that if this is meant to be a confessional from Jaime to Brienne about all his horrible misdoings, it #8217;s a poor one. If we go back to 02 x 07, we need to remember that *Brienne was there* when he was a prisoner and strangled his cousin. Whilst none of the Starks (other than Bran, of course) appear to be aware of the  #8220;pushing him out of a tower #8221;, Catelyn was, and directly references this in front of Brienne, and Brienne was, crucially, AT Riverrun. Catelyn talks about Jaime being  #8220;no knight #8221; here, and Jaime talks about the fact that  #8220;no matter what you do you #8217;re forsaking one vow or another - it #8217;s too much #8221;. Jaime taunts Brienne and Catelyn responds with  #8220;she is a truer knight that you #8217;ll ever be #8221; - which, of course, we know to be HUGELY prophetic. Catelyn states that Jaime is a  #8220;man without honor #8221; here - Jaime #8217;s (rather pathetic excuses) says he has more honor than  #8220;poor old dead Ned #8221; because he fathered a bastard (also, prophetically revealed to be widely incorrect in this episode) because he #8217;s always been faithful to Cersei - which he never breaks until this very episode. Broadly, though, I think there is a bigger theme here that Jaime doesn #8217;t believe he has been properly punished for his sins, whereas he thinks Cersei will perhaps die for hers. \- referencing Bran at approximately 1.00 here [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=\_pBoU3Z2D9E](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_pBoU3Z2D9E)) - but the rest of the clip is also hugely useful as well.</TEXT>

    <TITLE>Do we think this is the last we'll see / hear of Brienne?</TITLE>
    <DATE>2019-05-09 02:55:53</DATE>
    <TEXT>Super interested to hear if y #8217;all think this is the end of the Brienne arc, particularly in the fact that I think that the single reference to her in the spoilers is vague and/or if correct looks out of context. (and specific scenes pertaining to them in episode 4 weren #8217;t spoilt though I think many people might have suggested their eventual consummation of the relationship was somewhat inevitable). Do we think this is the last reference to her or she #8217;s still got a part to play? I loved episode 2 and thought it would have been a perfect fitting ending for her character if, for instance, she #8217;d died in episode 3, but I #8217;ve been a long believer that the Jaime/Brienne arc is a was always heading towards an if to-then unconsummated romance (as opposed to, say, Brienne / Podrick being buddies). I found the contrast between the ends of 2 and 4 for her particularly gutting seeing the range between joy and sadness. Some random thoughts:  #8203; * I watched back and listened to Jamie #8217;s references to his hateful deeds and then realised none of these should be shocking to Brienne - she, unlike almost no-one else there, knows about Bran, though maybe not the why (Catelyn references it in their very first scene together, in fact), the cousin incident happens in that same episode, when she #8217;s with Catelyn, and she was at and crucially involved at Riverrun. If it was meant to be a confessional, it #8217;s a lazy one  #8203; * Do we think she will undeniably stay in the North with Sansa? Do we think that Sansa, for all Brienne #8217;s loyalty, was goading Jaime with her pointed comment about Cersei? She #8217;s sworn to Catelyn to protect both Sansa and Arya, and Arya #8217;s off on her way for reasons vague and unclear.  #8203; * Strictly speaking, Tarth now sits in the Stormlands under Gendry, correct?  #8203; * Is the Starks attacking Cersei going to be deemed a direct attack on Jaime at this point and how does she feel about this?  #8203; * They #8217;ve gone to a lot of point of building her up to the  #8220;Knight of the Seven Kingdoms #8221; but since the actual naming have we see specificity of her honor reflecting back on that and is she likely to do one final heroic deed etc?  #8203; * Nikolaj has stopped himself in a conversation talking about the significance of Jaime and Brienne #8217;s swords citing getting in to dangerous territory (which are sister swords forged from Ice). Yes Jaime has knighted Brienne with his but I #8217;m not sure if this is the obvious conclusion to this.  #8203; * Can Brienne knight Podrick now? Has he squired long enough? All to say I would be sad to see this be the final mention of Brienne.</TEXT>

    <TITLE>[Spoilers Main] The theory of Flipped Arcs of Daenerys and Brienne in Season 8</TITLE>
    <DATE>2019-05-21 16:51:22</DATE>
    <TEXT>It occurred to me today - the dust now finally settled - that there is a subtle, potentially deliberate thread, throughout the final season in the contrast between Brienne and Daenerys #8217; scenes in the final season. These two are occasionally in the same location, but don't really converse, but they have interestingly intertwined arcs In Episode 2, Daenerys speaks of being told childhood bedtime stories of the Kingslayer In Episode 6, Brienne wields the power as Lord Commander to write in to history Jaime #8217;s story the way she sees fit. In Episode 2, Brienne is surrounded by her nearest and dearest, delighted and honoured to fight under her, and bends her knee when she Is knighted. In the same Episode, Daenerys is still struggling to get the support of the north and to get them to bend the knee, In Episode 3, the man that dies protecting Daenerys is a man she can #8217;t love - Jorah. In Episode 4/5, Brienne watches the man that she loves go off to protect another, but defends herself in the battle. In Episode 4, Brienne is surrounded by people delighted with her company (including Dany #8217;s hand, Tyrion), and several suitors (both Tormund and Jaime). Dany has an awkward moment with Jon and is horrified that people are not enthralled by her. In Episode 4, Brienne watches Jaime leave her, despite her pleading, but ultimately, doesn #8217;t follow and is tempered in preserving his memory when he is later killed. In Episode 5, Daenerys is rejected by Jon and then has a  #8220;let it be fear #8221; moment before she burns Kings Landing. In Episode 6, Daenerys gains power, briefly, until her hand resigns, and she is ultimately killed by Jon Brienne is given the title Lord Commander of the Kingsguard by someone else, and finishes the series the first female knight in Westeros and the only woman on the governing council heading the six kingdoms. I #8217;ve always been a big fan of both characters over the years and I adore both actresses. It #8217;s been hard to watch Dany fall this season and heartening to see Brienne rise. Anyhow this is really just a  #8220;thinking out loud #8221; piece, I think the physical differences between them and the stark differences between how they are accepted by the people around them are really interestingly portrayed. Interesting to see if anyone else has seen the same thing. (PS I acknowledge neither of their stories being perfect this season, but I really like the contrasts)</TEXT>

Interesting to see if anyone else has seen the same thing. There has been a bit of talk about this season not being "feminist" and as a woman I tend towards disagreeing with this - i think it's the trust in the personality of Dany that has caused so much of this. Brienne to me is a great example of a strong female character who as a reserved outsider will never garner massive crowds but is still a respected and strong force. (PS I acknowledge neither of their stories being perfect this season, but I really like the contrasts)</TEXT>

    <TEXT>\~note these are submissions! not nominations announced today\~ \*publicly nominated by HBO via official release about a month ago \^\^presumably? nominated by themself or management A couple of points! I'm no expert but I believe that to qualify for Guest Actor/Actress you need to be in less than half the episodes (hence only Carice being eligible) and that to qualify for Outstanding Supporting you need to be in at least 5% of scenes for the season and half the episodes. I'm pretty sure Lena only \*just\* qualified on screen time and I would have actually only guessed Gwendoline, Pilou and maybe Conleth Hill (Varys, who hasn't nominated) might have made that but goes to show how confusing Episode 3 was! Oh, and Gemma Whelan (Yara) has nominated, but for Gentleman Jack, not GoT. \~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~ Outstanding Lead Actor In A Drama Series  #8203; Kit Harrington as Jon Snow\* Outstanding Lead Actress In A Drama Series  #8203; Emilia Clarke as Daenerys Targaryen\* Outstanding Supporting Actor In A Drama Series Alfie Allen as Theon Greyjoy\^\^ Pilou Asbaek as Euron Greyjoy\^\^ Nikolaj Coster-Waldau as Jamie Lannister\* Peter Dinklage as Tyrion Lannister\* Richard Dormer as Lord Beric Dondarrion\*  #8203; Outstanding Supporting Actress In A Drama Series Gwendoline Christie as Brienne of Tarth \^\^ Lena Headey as Cersei Lannister\* Sophie Turner as Sansa Stark\* Maisie Williams as Arya Stark\*  #8203; Outstanding Guest Actress In A Drama Series Carice van Houten as Melisandre\^\^ (specifically for "The Long Night)</TEXT>

    <DATE>2019-06-20 10:23:07</DATE>
    <TEXT>Thought some of you might be interested in Emmy Awards race odds at this stage figures are From [https://www.goldderby.com/odds/combined-odds/emmy-awards-nominations-2019/](https://www.goldderby.com/odds/combined-odds/emmy-awards-nominations-2019/) Some points: Best Drama - Still odds on favourite to win, largely as a lot of shows have sat out this year. Trailed by Killing Eve, Better Call Saul, This is Us, Ozark, Succession, Homecoming, Pose, Bodyguard, and The Good Fight. Best Actor Drama - Only Kit Harington (Jon) nominated. Odds are 10/1. Bob Odenkirk (Better Call Saul), Jason Bateman (Ozark) and our former King of The North Robb Stark aka Richard Madden (Bodyguard) are at the top of the pool Best Actress - Only Emilia Clarke (Dany) nominated. Sandra Oh from Killing Eve is odds on favourite to win however she does have Jodie Comer from the same show in this category which may not help. Best Supporting Actor - Peter Dinklage (Tyrion) is a huge odds on favourite to win - almost all pundits expect that he is going to win this award. Nikolaj Coster-Waldau (Jaime) is third favourite, expected to get nominated. He was nominated for season 7 but lost to Dinklage. Alfie Allen (Theon) was a previously unknown nomination so odds may increase but is still at more than 100/1, as is Pilou Asbaek (Euron) and Richard Dormer (Beric) (also both newly advised nominations in the last week or so) Best Supporting Actress - Massively tight category not considered to have substantial competition outside of GoT. We are expected to have multiple nominations, up to four of six. Lena Headey (Cersei) and Maisie Williams (Arya) are tied with Julia Garner (Ozark) for best odds. Sophie Turner (Sansa) is also in the top 10 as is Gwendoline Christie (Brienne) who is a late nomination whose odds are going up. This is a category that does not favour young actresses historically which will hinder Maisie and Sophie as will as Garner from Ozark. Maisie has been nominated previously however Sophie has not been nominated in eight seasons. Lena has been nominated multiple times but has never won. I believe this is the first time Gwendoline has been put on the ballot/been in the race. The other major competitor is Rhea Seehorn from Better Call Saul who has the advantage of no other significant female competition from her show, but she has a history of being nominated and not winning. Best Guest Actress - Carice Van Houten (Melisandre) is the only nomination, she is in the top 5 (for episode 3, of course) Best Guest Actor - No Nominations, I don't think anyone substantial made the criteria.</TEXT>

Alfie Allen (Theon) was a previously unknown nomination advised in the last week or so and odds may increase but is still at more than 100/1, as is Pilou Asbaek (Euron) and Richard Dormer (Beric) (also both newly advised nominations in the last week or so) Best Supporting Actress - Massively tight category not considered to have substantial competition outside of GoT. We are expected to have multiple nominations, up to four of six, and a decent chance of winning - it's just a "who". Lena Headey (Cersei) and Maisie Williams (Arya) are tied with Julia Garner (Ozark) for best odds. Sophie Turner (Sansa) is also in the top 10 as is Gwendoline Christie (Brienne) who is a late nomination whose odds are going up. This is a category that does not favour young actresses historically which will hinder Maisie and Sophie as will as Garner from Ozark. Maisie has been nominated previously however Sophie has not been nominated in eight seasons. Lena has been nominated multiple times but has never won. I believe this is the first time Gwendoline has been put on the ballot/been in the race. The other major competitor is Rhea Seehorn from Better Call Saul who has the advantage of no other significant female competition from her show, but she has a history of being nominated and not winning. As we are all aware, Lena's lack of screentime this season works against her this year, but historical "love" for her could work in her favour. This is considered an "anyone's guess" category. Best Guest Actress - Carice Van Houten (Melisandre) is the only nomination, she is in the top 5 (for episode 3, of course) Best Guest Actor - No Nominations, I don't think anyone substantial made the criteria.</TEXT>

    <TITLE>Thought Exercise: Most appropriate (and inappropriate!) character for a kid friendly prequel to introduce them to Westeros?</TITLE>
    <DATE>2019-06-21 23:29:27</DATE>
    <TEXT>I've been musing this lately. I love the idea of a prequel of an existing character in a slightly less gory show to "introduce" younger viewers to the GoT world.  #8203; The question is, who would we chose and who would be the least appropriate?  #8203; 10 year old Tormund, with his giant backstory? One or all of the childhood Lannisters? A mysterious Melisandre? A story of the young Clegane brothers and what happened with the fire? Baby Brienne on Tarth learning her knightly ways? Davos growing up in Flea Bottom?</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Brienne says this in 5x01. I always rather liked the poetry of this line, despite thinking it was overdramatic and (at the time) incorrect, even for Brienne's very high moral code, and wondered if it would play out.

    <TITLE>My Extended List of 40+ Post Episode 6 Cast Interviews (with links and sources) on their thoughts on the season, GoT, and future plans</TITLE>
    <DATE>2019-06-23 16:20:40</DATE>
    <TEXT>I've tried to work on a list of post season cast interviews, and I thought I might share with r/freefolk This is all INTERVIEWS and direct pieces with cast - it is not press releases, reviews on their work, or third party articles republished A word on Sophie Turner - Sophie is doing an exceptional amount of "mixed" press at the moment for Dark Phoenix which means the dozens of interviews and press junkets are virtually impossible to categorise and the sources are hard to find (she also has more "gossip" coverage than anyone else by a mile). I've given her a separate section for interviews I particularly liked but feel free to go nuts! **Cast Interviews with Game of Thrones content**  #8203; My recommendations (I do tend towards longer wordier interviews!) My personal picks would be: both of Emilia's interviews, Isaac's op-ed in The Hollywood Reporter, Joe's lovely BBC chat, John's extended podcast interview (you get a great feel for his journey and personality), Lena's Guardian and Comic Con interviews, both Carice and Gwendoline's Gold Derby interviews, Gwendoline's Water Cooler Podcast interview and Times and Sydney Morning Herald pieces.

    <TITLE>(Spoilers Main) My Extended List of 40+ Post Episode 6 Cast Interviews (with links and sources) on their thoughts on the season, GoT, and future plans</TITLE>
    <DATE>2019-06-23 16:30:36</DATE>
    <TEXT>I've tried to work on a list of post season cast interviews, and I thought I might share This is all INTERVIEWS and direct pieces with cast - it is not press releases, reviews on their work, or third party articles republished A word on Sophie Turner - Sophie is doing an exceptional amount of "mixed" press at the moment for Dark Phoenix which means the dozens of interviews and press junkets are virtually impossible to categorise and the sources are hard to find (she also has more "gossip" coverage than anyone else by a mile). I've given her a separate section for interviews I particularly liked but feel free to go nuts! **Cast Interviews with Game of Thrones content** My recommendations (I do tend towards longer wordier interviews!) My personal picks would be: both of Emilia's interviews, Isaac's op-ed in The Hollywood Reporter, Joe's lovely BBC chat, John's extended podcast interview (you get a great feel for his journey and personality), Lena's Guardian and Comic Con interviews, both Carice and Gwendoline's Gold Derby interviews, Gwendoline's Water Cooler Podcast interview and Times and Sydney Morning Herald pieces. Carice Van Houten (Melisandre) (1) [Gold Derby](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=78alHZvXfes) (video) (20+ minutes) Emilia Clarke (Daenerys) (2) [The New

When we look outside of the  #8220;big player #8221; families, in the end, who really mattered in the outcome? Was it Olenna, for poisoning Joffrey and preventing a tyrannical rule? Sam, for revealing to Jon his family secret? Brienne, for killing Stannis and saving Sansa? Or, indeed, Stannis himself? Hodor, for preventing Bran from dying? Littlefinger? OLLY?

    <TEXT>This episode isn't ranked very highly on IMDB (30th of all the episodes) but I've always loved it, for various beats: \-Jaime's speech about killing the mad king is epic (in my opinion Coster Waldau's finest performance on the show) \-Beric fighting the Hound in a trial by combat where we learn that people can be bought back (crucial info for later) \-Jon / Ygritte \-Tywin being a boss setting up marriages \-Davos and Shireen (again) \-Some foreshadowing to the Red Wedding with Robb</TEXT>

In retrospect I like the kind of sad tragedy of it - that we didn't get the traditional, easy, happy love story, and I think the fact that NCW/Lena and Gwen are all nominated for Emmys for various highs and lows of it is testament to that.</TITLE>

    <TITLE>Songs you associate with Game of Thrones or Game of Thrones characters that aren't on Ramin Djawadi's soundtrack?</TITLE>
    <DATE>2019-07-28 02:18:17</DATE>
    <TEXT>Stream of consciousness on this! Anyone else have any songs? So this is an old Australian song from the 80s, most commonly associated with (Australian Rules) football grand finals over here, but I found myself invoking GoT in my head a lot every time I heard this over the course of the last season. [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iQI5fdVCvlU](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iQI5fdVCvlU) Hunters and Collectors "Holy Grail" Prior to the start of the season there was a Spotify playlist that D amp;D created which apparently had the "ending hidden in it". On post listen this is, in fact, mostly correct (save for a few moments). Furr by Blitzen Trapper was probably the biggest indication to me that the Starks would survive. I can't unhear the association now. Has previously been on the show Chuck [https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/2019/04/229513/game-of-thrones-spotify-playlist-songs-hidden-ending](https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/2019/04/229513/game-of-thrones-spotify-playlist-songs-hidden-ending) [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CmBgxP56R1I](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CmBgxP56R1I) Furr - Blitzen Trapper Yeah, yeah, yeah, Taylor Swift - but for good reason. This song is constantly played at my work (someone is a big fan) and I had never paid any attention to it but it is, according to Taylor, inspired Arya Stark, which is much more clear when you listen to it "I've got a list of names and yours is in red underlined" [https://www.polygon.com/game-of-thrones/2019/5/9/18563257/taylor-swift-easter-eggs-game-of-thrones-arya-stark-look-what-you-made-me-do](https://www.polygon.com/game-of-thrones/2019/5/9/18563257/taylor-swift-easter-eggs-game-of-thrones-arya-stark-look-what-you-made-me-do) [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3K0RzZGpyds](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3K0RzZGpyds) Taylor Swift "Look What You Made Me Do" Chelsea Dagger by the Fratellis - predates Thrones by Years but a friend of mine pointed out it would be a fantastic tune to play over light hearted sword fights / sex scenes etc and now I just imagine all the sword fights from GoT.

    <TEXT>I have a lot of feelings on this one! I'm off to work and thought I would open it up to the group first. On the GOOD examples of diversity: You probably can't fault them on disability representation (though I don't enjoy 'Bran the Broken') The knighting scene in season 8 is basically A+ Feminism for Men 101, A Short Guide. LGBTQI wasn't represented enough on the show in my opinion over the run</TEXT>

    <TEXT>\*Obligatory note to not be jerks\* So. Tyrion. One of the most beloved characters of all time, let alone in GoT. I feel like there is SO MUCH TIME that's been spent debating on Dany and Jon in Season 8, Sansa, Arya, Cersei/Jaime/Brienne. But Tyrion has so much screen time and he's so integral to the plot and yet I get to that small council scene and think: how DO I view Tyrion, in retrospect? I still haven't quite come to a conclusion. I feel his story was infinitely more sprawling and bit-part than everyone else's, and this made it hard? Is that just me? PS I love Dinklage and I think Tyrion's hilarious. But I don't even really know how I feel about him being hand again...</TEXT>

    <TITLE>Started going down a rabbit hole of looking in to what storylines, characters, and themes from GoT have trended in both the media and social media as time slowly goes on to see how things might be remembered...FASCINATING. And a testament to why interesting endings get more discussion. (LONG POST)</TITLE>
    <DATE>2019-08-30 13:20:15</DATE>
    <TEXT>All I have to say is WOW! Useful exercise in actually trying to understand what the ongoing narratives of the show might be. Could probably write 10,000 words (have a really disorganised Google Doc!) - but in summary I was trying to write a blog (which I ended up deciding against) and as part of that started seaching Twitter / Facebook / Instagram and Reddit (NOT just Freefolk) and looked in to Google News and what stories were picking up traction to try and understand who and what the media were getting clicks on as well as what people were discussing on social media. This is trends, not "Bob wrote an article on Davos Seaworth and how dare you not mention it" (for what it's worth, I think we need more Davos analysis) I should probably point out I don't have any particularly sophisticated tools, but some of this is not rocket science: It's not hard to see if Samwell hasn't had a single Reddit thread or is getting 2% of the instagram tags as Arya, or that you can search Google news and not find a single Jorah story for two months. I tried searching ALL of Reddit, not just Freefolk, and actually looking at what got upvoted or commented on and not largely ignored, nonsensical rants. \-Despite what people think they wanted, Giving people satisfying arcs, deaths, or nice "tie ups" doesn't garner much discussion. In short, no one much talks about Davos, Samwell, Gilly, Jorah, Bronn, Lyanna, Beric, Varys, The Mountain, The Night King, Podrick, or Euron except with fond recollection. The Hound has a little bit of social media love for being attached to Arya's story, and Tormund is a walking meme, but it's all the other characters. It's widely acknowledged Theon's arc was perfect, and the media has acknowledged this in retrospective (especially in light of Alfie's Emmy nomination, but this was clearly the standout prior), but social media is significant fascinated in not fleshing out Yara in the final season (her story, along with Greyworm's, are largely the most "you neglected this" complaints) **Characters, Storylines, and How They'll Be Remembered** **Dany and Jon** \-I think to be kind to the overwhelming majority, they are still in the denial stage with Daenerys and Jon. The media is almost scared to discuss and it's hard to find a safe space to discuss the situation without it becoming a shout-down. There's still an awful lot of fan worship for Dany. The narrative is much kinder to Daenerys than Jon. Like a country that's just been decimated by war, we're too close. If you're a Jon/Dany shipper or you loved Dany to the point of her being your idol, there's almost too much mental work to even go there on this one. It was nothing if not a VERY bold decision. **King Bran** \-Bran being king has aged OK. No one's thrilled, but no one is horrified. I perhaps people just need separation between Dany being killed and Bran being named 20 minutes later to be able to think this whole thing through. **Arya** \-Arya. Despite there being some short term disappointment Arya didn't get a face-swapping Cersei kill, on balance I think people are pretty happy with the Night King kill and Arya toning it down in Season 8, if for no other reason than it keeps the Legend of Arya Stark story intact. Feelings on Arya are very melancholic at series end. (Also: the Gendry/Arya shippers are foing OK. It was on brand for her to sail off,) **Tyrion** \-Tyrion. For such a major character, Tyrion gets surprisingly little discussion, outside of some reasonable assessments - is he the smartest man alive? Does he drink and know things? In the fire and ice of Season 8, Tyrion's stuck in the middle, and it's hard to really know where to stand on him. In general, it's hard to hate Tyrion, but viewer feelings have hardened significantly on Tyrion. **Missandei and Greyworm** Missandei and Greyworm - the media seems concerned that as people of color the treatment of their characters will not age well. Social media isn't so direct, but their stories being a foil for Jon and Dany's larger storyline, in many ways, means they get a significant amount of discussion for more minor characters (Nathalie Emmanuel, notably, only had six lines this season). The media's assessment is probably not unfair. **Melisandre** Melisandre - People liked this a lot, and basically want to go back and watch more Melisandre. They really enjoyed the fact that Melisandre continues to be mysterious, even in death. She'll be remembered as a basically mystical being, one of the best parts of GoT, I think. **Cersei** \-Cersei - there was an awful lot of outrage about how Cersei died when it happened, but it's aged pretty well. Episode 5 was intense, people (I mean, a few other things happened!) and watching Cersei crumble (physically and metaphorically) in her own castle worked (though I think an awful lot of people still dream of that alternative Arya kills Cersei ending, including Lena and Maisie). We disliked not seeing a lot of Cersei this season more because we love Lena Headey, but the slow crumble of her reign worked, for the most part. (but dude, people REALLY need to stop attacking Lena Headey on Instagram and thinking she IS Cersei) **Jaime** \-Jaime - this, as per the above, has aged well. Adding a "it's not a clear redemption arc" has garnered an awful lot more discussion than a straightforward one ever would. It did seem to need a little bit more work on the analysis, but I think to the credit of all three main actors involved (NCW, Lena and Gwendoline) they've all been fairly consistent in their messaging on this storyline, which has helped the narrative enormously. Jaime is still remembered fairly fondly - he's just considered very flawed. The outrage towards his decision making has swung from fever pitch after episode 4 to fairly good natured. (I'm fairly sure that two minute scene where he leaves Winterfell garnered outrage only second to Dany ignoring the bells) **Brienne** Brienne - this one is interesting in that Brienne's storyline is the one that landed well at season end but continues to gain more and more traction. There's enough emotional ups and downs in this that it didn't read as boring but it wasn't so heavy handed that it was beyond discussion (aka her breakdown after Jaime walks away being seen as somewhat out of character vs Dany burning down Kings Landing being somewhat out of character), plus the symbolism of the knighting was lost on no one. At first I thought this was mostly spurred by Gwendoline's surprise Emmy nom but on track back this has been building since seasons end. I think Thrones fans really, really needed a slightly more grown up female hero (with respect to Arya), and this delivered. **Sansa** \-Ah, Sansa Stark. I find this HARD to break apart. There's a notable difference between the media and certain parts of social media here, and, I think, between different age groups and genders (women are much kinder to Sansa). The narrative (particularly on Reddit) is inherently tied to Sansa's interference with Jon and Dany. She is highly disliked on Reddit, but very loved on Instagram and in-between on Twitter. Younger fans LOVE Sansa and Sophie Turner has a sort of influencer-popularity at the moment untied to her being on GoT which makes analysing how proliferant media mentions are difficult, not to mention any media analysis of questioning the one female queen left is a bold for the media. This might take some time, I think. (Sophie Turner not being someone whose footwear garners 45 Google News mentions a week might help with this). Anyway: I thought it was interesting and had to share. I think, specifically, that any Emmy wins outside of Peter Dinklage for actors might add to the narrative of "how characters are remembered" too, some more than others. But we'll see. Particularly interested in anyone's feelings or insights and particular trying to get my head around the response to Sansa is something I could use some help with.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>\*This is an Emmy nominations appreciation post, to praise any amazing work done by both crew and cast\*\* The Emmys will be held on September 14 and 15 (Creative Arts Emmys) and September 22 (Primetime Emmys) Unless you #8217;ve been living under a rock, you know that one of the GREAT good news stories for the Game of Thrones cast and crew this year was the love given by the academy by a record 32 nominations! Notably, we have 10 acting nominations - the most ever! Kit and Emilia have been nominated for lead categories, Carice for guest, and then we have taken out multiple nominations in the supporting categories, which I think is a wonderful achivement by our ensemble cast. For supporting actor, we have Alfie Allen, Nikolaj Coster Waldau, and Peter Dinklage, and for supporting actress we have Gwendoline Christie, Lena Headey, Sophie Turner and Maisie Williams. The crew have been nominated for an enormous amount of awards, in particular for the work submitted to the academy mostly for *The Long Night* and *The Bells.* I #8217;ve detailed what #8217;s been nominated for each episode below, to give some scope of what was achieved.  #8203; NOMINATIONS **Outstanding Drama Series**  #8203; **Episode Highlights**  #8203; **Winterfell** Editing Acting episode submission for Sophie Turner for Outstanding Supporting Actress  #8203; **A Knight of The Seven Kingdoms** Acting episode submission for Gwendoline Christie for Outstanding Supporting Actress Acting episode submission for Nikolaj Coster-Waldau for Outstanding Supporting Actor  #8203; **The Long Night** Acting episode submission for Maisie Williams for Outstanding Supporting Actress Acting episode submission for Alfie Allen for Outstanding Supporting Actor Acting episode submission for Carice Van Houten for Outstanding Guest Actress Hairstyling Single Camera Picture Editing Sound Mixing Sound Editing Main Title Design Makeup Music Composition, Original Dramatic Score Prosthetic Makeup Directing, Miguel Sapochnik  #8203; **The Last of The Starks** Acting episode submission for Emilia Clarke for Outstanding Lead Actress Directing  #8203; **The Bells** Acting episode submission for Lena Headey for Outstanding Supporting Actress Fantasy/Sci Fi Costumes Cinematography Production Design Special Visual Effects  #8203; **The Iron Throne** Acting episode submission for Peter Dinklage for Outstanding Supporting Actor Acting episode submission for Kit Harington for Outstanding Lead Actor Single Camera Picture Editing Directing Writing  #8203; **Game of Thrones: The Last Watch Documentary** Music Composition for A Documentary Series  #8203; **Fight for The Living: Beyond The Wall Virtual Reality Experience** Creative Achievement in Interactive Media Within A Scripted Program  #8203; **Overall** Casting Stunts</TEXT>

    <TITLE>Season 8 is hard because it #8217;s full of uncomfortable, human truths: we oft make questionable decisions, have to wade through an ethical minefield often to achieve dreams, act out due to trauma or fear, can be far easier influenced than we #8217;d ever like to admit, and love indiscriminately.</TITLE>
    <DATE>2019-09-18 09:25:27</DATE>
    <TEXT>In my opinion, this is why people find Season 8 so damn hard to take. You need to be in the right headspace to have that message delivered in to your brain. Season 8 through so many of the stories claws at a great deal of the human truths of our psyche, things that are in many cases very, very difficult to admit to ourselves. If you #8217;ve supported Daenerys for a long time - with rousing music and great oration - it #8217;s hard to admit you may have missed parts of her message that weren #8217;t as pure of heart as your own heart when the inevitable happens. Some of us know we are like Jaime - we love someone indiscriminately until they are the (virtual) death of us, living other loved ones grieving, frustrated, or heartbroken in our wake. Sansa isn #8217;t always likeable up close, and a lot of people moving towards power who need to use a virtual Game of Thrones to politically maneuvour their way there aren #8217;t. There are plenty of other examples, but that #8217;s my general feeling.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>So the Emmys on the weekend will be the biggest cultural GoT event since the finale: the first time there are cast interviews, they're all in the same place, D amp;D are likely in attendance. What do you suspect will be the impact in the fan community and media? Can you see anything in particular going down really badly if it happens (particular writing/directing/show/acting awards)? I hate that we have to think about this, for what it's worth. Toxic hate is a terrible thing.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Awards nominated by readers of the awards site Gold Derby are announced later this morning (or this night if you're in my time zone!). These are NOT necessarily a precursor to the Emmys, guys, but they're still nice as they're voted on by about 1500 users that clearly care about rewarding performances / etc across the board (and some categories have identical nominees!). There are some notable differences here in categories : In particular in things like Drama Episode (amazing what happens when the episodes are nominated by the users and not the network!) are different \*I will note I will be UTTERLY shocked if Lena Headey doesn't win this as Gold Derby forum is renowned for being a Lena Headey stan safe haven - but who knows! GoT nominations: Nominated for: Best Drama Series Best Drama Episode (2 of 6): A Knight of The Seven Kingdoms, The Long Night\* (my heart is with episode 2, which hasn't been submitted for anything else)\*corrected hahaha Best Drama Actor: Kit Harington (shout out here to Richard Madden for Bodyguard, who didn't get an Emmy nomination) Best Drama Actress: Emilia Clarke Best Drama Supporting Actor: Alfie Allen, Nikolaj Coster Waldau, Peter Dinklage (3 of 6) Best Drama Supporting Actress: Gwendoline Christie, Maisie Williams, Lena Headey (3 of 6, no Sophie here) Best Drama Guest Actress: Carice Van Houten I'll report back if we win anything, but I thought it was great to get some more nominations in another area once again.</TEXT>

    <TITLE>The Best Qualities of Various Character Fanbases, an Appreciation Post</TITLE>
    <DATE>2019-09-19 03:50:50</DATE>
    <TEXT>So: one of the more interesting things that has come out of the Emmys race is the full force of various stans across the internet which got me thinking about what their GOOD qualities are: ie 1. Lena Headey / Cersei stans have hands down the best GIF game and wit of the fandom period. They're great to interact with 2. Kristofer Hivju / Tormund fans have really enthusiastic cosplay. They are really fun to look out for. 3. The vast majority of Emilia / Dany fans have been wonderfully understanding after the events of Season 8, and Emilia probably has a fan base for life. 4. Gwendoline has real "money where there mouth is" fans - she had to do three months of stage doors after her recent play from people wanting to get selfies and give her gifts and say hi. 5. Jason Momoa's fan base has definitely followed him on to a new career 6. As has Richard Madden's, despite it being many years and him taking on quite different roles. any other examples?</TEXT>

    <TITLE>Other Awards Upcoming (Outside of The Emmys)</TITLE>
    <DATE>2019-09-24 12:58:54</DATE>
    <TEXT>Stargoron posted about this the other day but I thought it warranted another post. I generally think Awards are a good and positive thing for us to get behind. In terms of other major awards ceremonies for acting, mostly: We have SAG (Screen Actors Guild) and Golden Globes upcoming early next year. Because of the way these awards are structured, we won't have a clean sweep situation as per the Emmy noms. Some of the nominees for this should be obvious but who they choose to go for with the GGs is probably up to them. The People's Choice Awards are on in November and Sophie, Maisie and Kit are nominated (publicly voted and as you will see by the other nominees skew young) I also really suggest people getting behind the GoT fansite Watchers on The Wall who are doing Season 8 GOT awards (WE CAN'T LOSE) and I believe later on will be doing a "series as a whole" award. They are in the process of sorting out their nominations but they are nutting down lots of fun categories like Best scene (check the page for details as they will likely have polls) and best line. They have already announced all the nominees for their acting categories except supporting actor: [https://watchersonthewall.com/watchers-wall-awards-season-8-best-supporting-actor-preliminary-round/#more-176353](https://watchersonthewall.com/watchers-wall-awards-season-8-best-supporting-actor-preliminary-round/#more-176353)</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Continuing on from another post, but....I'm always curious as to where they live, gender, age. Surely your understanding or happiness of an ending like Season 8 will be different depending on your life circumstances. For instance: if your ship doesn't work and you're 14 surely that's different than if you're 30. Also I was browsing most popular shows on iTunes (just before they've closed it) and JustWatch (app that tells you what service streams what) the other day for different countries to find out what people continue to watch and there are countries that seem to love GoT with a fervour vs some that have gone rogue / hated it (for instance I am in Australia and I can think of ONE and only one article that was at all complimentary to the final season. It's an almost hate-fest). I'm sure the political climate / view you have can also play a part.</TEXT>

Shortlists have been determined already, so you can't randomly vote for someone who hasn't made the shortlist (for acting, it's the recent Emmy nominees plus Charles Dance + Michelle Fairley + a bunch of guests) Best Drama, Ensemble Cast of The Decade, Best Actor, Best Actress, Best Supporting Actress, Best Supporting Actor, Best Guest Actor, Best Guest Actress, Best Episode (there are about a dozen GoT eps to chose from) [https://www.goldderby.com/leagues/](https://www.goldderby.com/leagues/) Click "[Gold Derby TV Decade Awards 2010-2019 Nominations](https://www.goldderby.com/leagues/login)"</TEXT>

It makes me think that it was recorded a LONG time back, maybe earl this year. Some super interesting stuff in roughly the last 40% of the show (talks a lot about doing theatre which isn #8217;t something I have heard her talk about much else anywhere) https://open.spotify.com/show/0adxWCLDfRwBbeF0qEB2CE Here is Gwendoline is New York last night with the (hilariously offstage but still en pointe) ballet dancer Misty Copeland who is an MVP herself . https://www.gettyimages.com.au/detail/news-photo/gwendoline-christie-and-misty-copeland-pose-backstage-at-news-photo/1181321898?adppopup=true Also in NYC, every damn shot for Dinklage #8217;s play Cyrano looks something like this.

    <TEXT>(this has been proven after analysis FWIW) It feels like more - I get there is non verbal stuff and this isn't necessarily reflective of SCREEN TIME but I think it just makes me frustrated on an overall level for women and them getting lots to do in TV and movies in general, not just on GoT. It's not that they were getting heaps before, but I feel like their stories were just as important as the men's. \*Also the Emmy nominations were amazing given this. This is not a criticism of the actresses. I know there is more female friendly TV now, but it's still really limited as a whole. (end of rant).</TEXT>

    <DATE>2019-10-25 07:30:26</DATE>
    <TEXT>Is this one of the reasons Season 8 becomes so confusing? Arya's almost apolitical feelings about Dany (she doesn't want to make her an ally, doesn't vote at the council, but she appreciates they needed her dragons and fights with her in The Battle of Winterfell, effectively). Sansa and Arya not being overly hostile, but certainly never falling over each other in sisterly love. Dany and Cersei ending up rather similar in the end. Sansa and Dany being similarly political. Brienne's framing of Cersei/Jaime in history as noble. One of the other shows I love (which I find completely uncontroversial) has had raging hatred around the drawing of characters like this, but it strikes me as....real. And often how men are drawn</TEXT>

    <TEXT>My interpretation is that it is to be interpreted on J/B balance mostly as Brienne POV chapters (with a number of other characters) and almost no Jaime Yes there are moments - but we never REALLY get in Jaime's head, except for fleeting scenes. Our capacity to understand what Brienne is feeling is far more profound. The show is literally filmed, in many cases, in this way. Yes Jaime shows up independently, but often with Tyrion hanging along, giving HIS version of the events. Tyrion has by far the most dialogue in this season. Those would probably be Tyrion POVs.</TEXT>

    <TITLE>Cast/Crew interviews where they #8217;re asked on the interpretations on the end of the show, not their opinion on the reaction...?</TITLE>
    <DATE>2019-11-01 00:16:33</DATE>
    <TEXT>I think this is a good idea for a compilation post going into the DVD commentary being released. I think the opinions of those who worked with D amp;D are really valid. Actors commenting on the final plot (as opposed to their characters) exist but they #8217;re not always reported on given to the circlejerk around the ending, so they #8217;re oft buried in interviews. Several actors have spoken about their characters extensively, which helps, but I think those rare comments that are more general might be more insightful. Interestingly I rarely see interviewers even ask -they #8217;re far more Interested I #8217;m discussing drama for clickbait. Anyone able to help me with any specific stuff they #8217;ve come across? In my opinion Em #237;lia and Kit may have spoken but not extensively about their interpretation of this, unless I am mistaken. I don #8217;t know if I have heard Maisie and Sophie speak specifically about the ending that wasn #8217;t inherent to their characters anywhere Cast that I believe or know have but I would love some help on capturing verbatim stuff: -John Bradley in the NPR Bullseye podcast -Liam, Conleth and Isaac in various places (inc possibly SDCC Comic Con to some extent -Nikolaj at Cons, but I feel specifically in an off-stage interview at a European Comic Con? -Carice in an interview during Emmy Awards week (I think The Hollywood Reporter?) -Alfie and Gwendoline in separate video interviews with Gold Derby with Rob Licuria (Rob loved the ending). -Gwendoline some other places (because she #8217;d predicted Bran) -????? Lena at Comic Con or was she just asked about Cersei PS I specifically feel like post GoT comments as opposed to cryptic pre S8 ones are useful. -</TEXT>

    <TITLE>A rant/ramble on regional perspective, visual storytelling, Google Trends and GoT and some other stuff</TITLE>
    <DATE>2019-11-08 01:14:02</DATE>
    <TEXT>So...I started to write some stuff on some of the stuff I found on Google Trends when I was digging yesterday last night but I was tired and couldn't spell well (sorry, painkillers) and so I thought it was better to do today. Anyway - Google Trends is a really interesting tool (and free) to see where and what trends on Google, YouTube etc and when. You can see everything from which episode people saw as the nicest to the weirdest to the most amazing in the moment or the most WTF (surprise! It was the Red Wedding!) However, the thing that emerged as I started looking up GoT was just how...REGIONAL things are perceived, and what that might tell us about things like politics. You'd think, for instance, when you look at Worldwide trends that Dany would be the favourite character everywhere - but this isn't true. There's huge differences in how much certain characters are liked/Googled in various places, and then there are incredibly interesting breakdowns: for instance over the course of five years, all US states had about the same feelings on Dany compared to the other main female characters, but this wildly changed (up and down) post finale. There are places that love Sansa and hate Sansa and places that obsess over Jon. Some places in the world Arya might as well be the only character. Then there are other things to consider - that there are regions that may not get great translations - or any or poor translations or dubs - and may be very much dependent on the visual story. When that's the case, how does the story translate? There is one state in Australia where this is much more likely to be the case, and the breakdown IS much different. Many many other interesting things in there as well - for instance America disproportionately thought the scariest episode was "The Bells" but worldwide, it's "The Children" (I'm not American, but I would also probably go with the Bells, but I can also see how there are particular scenes in "The Children" that might be perceived that way, particularly without audio. It's more "personally" violent) And for the record on the Benioff and Weiss thing (worldwide)...Benioff and Weiss are less well known/Googled (even this year) than Emilia, Sophie, Kit, Maisie, Lena, Peter, Gwendoline, Nikolaj, Carice, Nathalie, and Jason Momoa (who is more Googled than Emilia) and Natalie Dormer. They're about as well known as Alfie, on balance (Benioff is more well known than Weiss). Really just a rant.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>From Google Trends.The non deaths / favourite moments / best acting / why ever else people Google things. Taken from the last 90 days - so what people Google now knowing the full story Notably, outside spectacle deaths, there's only about five or six moments that I'd consider really sad or torturous to the characters (most of which are excellent acting moments) A few things missing I am surprised by! **Season 1** * Tyrion #8217;s talk with Jon  #8220;Never forget who you are (1x01) Ned tells Cat  #8220;Winter is Coming #8221; (1x01) * Tyrion slaps Joffrey (1x02), Jon gives Arya needle (1x02) * Jaime versus Ned Stark (1x05) * Arya and Syrio Forel  #8220;Not Today #8221; (1x06) * Daenerys gets her dragons (1x10) **Season 2** * Davos, Mathos and Salladhor Sam (2x2) (this is cool. I'd forgotten about it) * Renly gives Brienne a place in his Kingsguard and we meet Margaery (2x03) * Theon #8217;s  #8220;What is Dead May Never Die Speech (2x10) (very cool, and probably a way to remember Alfie's acting without watching Reek being tortured) **Season 3** * Catelyn talks to Talisa about Jon (3x02) (such a great inclusion, contextually) * Jaime loses his hand (3x04) * Jaime tells Brienne about the mad king (3x05) * Jon Snow and Ygritte in the cave (3x05) * The Hound and Beric #8217;s sword fight (3x05) * Jaime saves Brienne from the bear (3x07) **Season 4** * Margaery and Joffrey #8217;s Wedding (4x02) * Tyrion #8217;s Trial (4x6) * Alliser Thorne #8217;s speech in The Battle of Castle Black (4x9) * Brienne vs The Hound (4x10) * Stannis arrives at the wall (4x10) **Season 5** * Margaery and Tommen #8217;s Wedding (5x03) * Jaime sails past and stares at Tarth on his way to Dorne (5x04) * Cersei #8217;s walk of Shame (5x10) **Season 6** * Sansa returns to Winterfell and is reunited with Jon (6x04) * Bran meets the Night King (6x05) * Bran Stark #8217;s vision (6x06) * Davos confront Melisandre (6x10) * Cersei takes revenge on Tyene and Ellaria (6x10) * Tyrion is made hand of the king (6x10) * Cersei blows up the Sept (6x10) (yes I know this is deaths too but it's a moment) * Lyanna Mormont #8217;s speech calling Jon King of The North (6x10) **Season 7** * Sam Cures Jorah (7x02) (really love this being included) * Olenna Tyrell #8217;s  #8220;Tell Cersei, I want her to know it was me #8221; speech to Jaime (7x03) * Missandei and Davos introducing Jon and Dany (7x03) * Sansa and Arya #8217;s reunion (7x04) * Brienne vs Arya sparring (7x4) * Daenerys saves Jon beyond the Wall (7x06) * Tormund chats to the Hound (7x06) * Jon and Dany get together (7x07) **Season 8** * Jon and Daenerys kiss and ride a dragon (8x01) * Sansa meets Daenerys (8x01) * Jon Snow and Arya reunite (8x01) * Jaime #8217;s Winterfell trail (8x2) * Brienne is knighted by Jaime (8x2) * Arya and Gendry get together (8x2) * Sansa and Daenerys #8217;s:  #8220;What about the North? #8221; chat (8x2) * Podrick sings  #8220;Jenny of Oldstones #8221; (8x02) * Melisandre lights the trench (8x03) * Sansa and The Hound #8217;s  #8220;You #8217;ve changed, little bird #8221; chat (8x4) * Jon tells and Arya and Sansa his real name (8x4) * Brienne and Jaime get together (8x04) * Jaime leaves Winterfell to Brienne crying (8x04) * The Bells ring and Daenerys burns KL (8x05) * Tyrion finds Jaime and Cersei and breaks down (8x06) * Sansa Stark  #8220;Queen of The North #8221; (8x6) * Bran is proclaimed king (8x06) The deaths Most deaths end up on the "most searched" on YouTube - if you're a minor or repulsive character, it's likely to be your defining scene. (and Joffrey is the most searched) Viserys (1x06) Khal kills Mogo (1x08) Ned Stark (1x09) Renly (2x05) Cat, Talisa and Robb (3x09) Joffrey (4x02) Lysa (4x07), Tyrion kills Tywin (4x10) Jojen (4x10) Janos Slynt (5x03) Tormund kills the Lord of Bones (5x08) Stannis burns Shireen (5x09) Merryn Trant (5x10) Myrcella #8217;s Death (5x10) Brienne executes Stannis (5x10) Ramsay kills Roose (6x02) Hodor (6x05) Ramsay Bolton and Rickon Stark (6x09) Mace, Loras and Margaery Tyrell aka Sept of Baelor (6x10) Arya and House Frey (6x10) Arya and House Frey pt 2 (7x01), Littlefinger (7x07) Melisandre Beric, Jorah, Theon and Lyanna (8x03) Arya Kills the Night King (8x03) Missandei (8x04) Jaime and Cersei, Qyburn, Varys and Cleganebowl (8x05) Daenerys (8x06)</TEXT>

    <TITLE>Let's Talk about Sex (and nudity) in GoT the way the show handled it</TITLE>
    <DATE>2019-11-21 11:36:03</DATE>
    <TEXT>So I thought I would open this up as a more general discussion in light of Emilia's comments on Dax's podcast the other day. I think there's a load of interesting threads about sex in GoT - from characters who are very sexual to chaste, there are seasons with a lot of nudity and then others (particularly S8) with very little, there are moments where I think nudity may be (in retrospect) thought of as unnecessary and others where it appears to be used judiciously. We have threads around men being castrated, we have the famous season 5 scene where Cersei is humiliated. What did you love? Related to? Find challenging \*Please try and be respectful\*</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Results for GoT: [https://www.ranker.com/crowdranked-list/best-female-tv-characters-of-all-time](https://www.ranker.com/crowdranked-list/best-female-tv-characters-of-all-time) Arya Stark (#2) Daenerys Targaryen (#3) Brienne of Tarth (#18) Cersei Lannister (#22) Margaery Tyrell (#29) Sansa Stark (#49) Catelyn Stark (#70) Ygritte (#103) Olenna Tyrell (#138) No other female characters from GoT made the top 1000. There isn't really a male equivalent of this list (I guess there's many more fleshed out male characters historically on TV) I really thought this list showed we really did have an embarassment of riches There's some interesting omissions on this list or particularly low-ranked, characters on very long running shows and actresses/characters who have won many awards/Emmys. I also tend to think, purely based on my experience (after a really long two week discussion in a massive Facebook group I'm in about a year ago about a similar topic) that this is pretty true to what "the general person" thinks (the #1 came up again and again and again)</TEXT>

    <TITLE>Here #8217;s Open Sources definition of  #8220;different types of characters #8221; - at completion of GoT, who sits where?</TITLE>
    <DATE>2019-11-25 23:27:41</DATE>
    <TEXT>This is open sources definition of types of Characters in Fiction. I think it #8217;s fascinating to look at this and compare it to the show at completion - where do we categorise everyone? In particular who truly are the mains? The foils? The protagonists? The antagonists? The anti-heroes? The symbolic characters? "What does characterization do for a story? In a nutshell, it allows us to empathize with the protagonist and secondary characters, and thus feel that what is happening to these people in the story is vicariously happening to us; and it also gives us a sense of verisimilitude, or the semblance of living reality. An important part of characterization is dialogue, for it is both spoken and inward dialogue that afford us the opportunity to see into the characters' hearts and examine their motivations. In the best of stories, it is actually characterization that moves the story along, because a compelling character in a difficult situation creates his or her own plot." Karen Bernardo, Characterization in Literature In fictional literature, authors use many different types of characters to tell their stories. Different types of characters fulfill different roles in the narrative process, and with a little bit of analysis, you can usually detect some or all of the types below. Major or central characters are vital to the development and resolution of the conflict. In other words, the plot and resolution of conflict revolves around these characters. Minor characters serve to complement the major characters and help move the plot events forward. Dynamic - A dynamic character is a person who changes over time, usually as a result of resolving a central conflict or facing a major crisis. Most dynamic characters tend to be central rather than peripheral characters, because resolving the conflict is the major role of central characters. Static - A static character is someone who does not change over time; his or her personality does not transform or evolve. Round - A rounded character is anyone who has a complex personality; he or she is often portrayed as a conflicted and contradictory person. Flat - A flat character is the opposite of a round character. This literary personality is notable for one kind of personality trait or characteristic. Stock - Stock characters are those types of characters who have become conventional or stereotypical through repeated use in particular types of stories. Stock characters are instantly recognizable to readers or audience members (e.g. the femme fatale, the cynical but moral private eye, the mad scientist, the geeky boy with glasses, and the faithful sidekick). Stock characters are normally one-dimensional flat characters, but sometimes stock personalities are deeply conflicted, rounded characters (e.g. the "Hamlet" type). Protagonist - The protagonist is the central person in a story, and is often referred to as the story's main character. He or she (or they) is faced with a conflict that must be resolved. The protagonist may not always be admirable (e.g. an anti-hero); nevertheless s/he must command involvement on the part of the reader, or better yet, empathy. Antagonist - The antagonist is the character(s) (or situation) that represents the opposition against which the protagonist must contend. In other words, the antagonist is an obstacle that the protagonist must overcome. Anti-Hero - A major character, usually the protagonist, who lacks conventional nobility of mind, and who struggles for values not deemed universally admirable. Duddy, in Mordecai Richler's The Apprenticeship of Duddy Kravitz, is a classic anti-hero. He's vulgar, manipulative and self-centered. Nevertheless, Duddy is the center of the story, and we are drawn to the challenges he must overcome and the goals he seeks to achieve. Foil - A foil is any character (usually the antagonist or an important supporting character) whose personal qualities contrast with another character (usually the protagonist). By providing this contrast, we get to know more about the other character. Symbolic - A symbolic character is any major or minor character whose very existence represents some major idea or aspect of society. For example, in Lord of the Flies, Piggy is a symbol of both the rationality and physical weakness of modern civilization; Jack, on the other hand, symbolizes the violent tendencies (the Id) that William Golding believes is within human nature.</TEXT>

    <DATE>2019-12-06 01:19:06</DATE>
    <TEXT>**SAG** Drama Ensemble #3 TV Drama Actor (combined supporting and lead) Peter #3, Kit #8, Nikolaj #19 , Alfie not in odds(Billy Porter considered a lock) TV Drama Actress Emilia #12, Maisie, Gwendoline, Sophie, Lena #18-21 (top 4 spots considered to locks in this award - three previous Oscar winners + Comer who won the Emmy - there are only 5 spots) **Golden Globes** Best Drama - Game of Thrones #4 Drama Actor - Kit #5 Drama Actress - Emilia #12 Supporting Actor (supporting categories also include limited series and comedy) - Peter #4, Nikolaj $19, Alfie #24 Supporting Actress - Lena #14, Maisie #15, Gwendoline #18, Sophie #21 **Critics Choice odds are not listed for TV** For reference - the Golden Globes are voted on by less than 100 members of the Hollywood Foreign Press Association (a vast number of whom were invited to the premiere) and nominees by SAG by 2000 selected members of the Screen Actors Guild (with everyone able to vote for the winner). The Critic #8217;s Choice is voted on by about 300 members of the BFCA in Canada and the US. Specifics of each - Golden Globes is more international (tends to reflect the BAFTAs more so), SAG is peer-nominated, and Critic #8217;s Choice is US/Canada centric. GG #8217;s tend to be by far the most unpredictable. Unlike the Emmys we don #8217;t have visibility over who was even submitted (ie Lena might not qualify on an awards specific 5% screentime rule) or whether the network has decided to go all in on promoting one candidate for FYC given the small size of the categoris and increased competition (probably most relevant in Supporting Actress and at the Globes given the small amount of candidates) **For reference:** Peter has been nominated for a SAG before but no one else has individually Peter and Lena have been nominated for Golden Globes (Peter won in 2011 but hasn #8217;t been nominated since) There have been multiple SAG Ensemble nominations. For reference in context to Emmy odds a few days before nominations were announced: Game of Thrones was predicted to win and be nominated for Drama series (and did) Emilia was #5 for actress, Kit #6 for actor, Lena #2 for supporting actress, Maisie #3, Sophie #5, Gwendoline #9 , Peter was #1 for supporting, Nikolaj #3, Alfie #17, for Guest Carice was #5.</TEXT>

    <TITLE>Most liked episodes - Gender Bias and Preference on IMDB</TITLE>
    <DATE>2020-03-12 18:32:39</DATE>
    <TEXT>So: fun fact - most people who review on IMDB are men. That means sometimes, you need to look further in to the demographics of a show to see a bit more info. Generally, men and women mark GoT almost the same, women being a tiny more favourable. Started looking at the "which episodes were preferred by men or women". Keep in mind review bombing for Season 8. I really expected Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken to have the biggest gender bias (it didn't, it was actually preferred by women) but the eventual episode with the most disparity was so disproportionate it doubled the next two episodes **Identical Scores** S1 Winter is Coming (same) 1.01, The Wolf and The Lion (same) 1.05, A Golden Crown (same) 1.06, You Win or You Die (same) 1.07, Fire and Blood 1.10, S2 The Old Gods and The New 2.06, Valar Morghulis 2.10 S3 The Rains of Castamere 3.09 S4 Two Swords 4.01, The Lion and The Rose 4.02, Mockingbird 4.07, The Children 4.10 S5 Sons Of The Harpy 5.04 S6 The Door 6.05, Battle of The Bastards 6.09, The Winds of Winter 6.10, The Spoils of War 7.04 S8 The Iron Throne 8.06 - however, huge age disparity - for the record, most disliked by women 18-29 and most liked by people 45+ - nearly a two point difference) **Favoured by Men** **+0.2 (Men)** S4 The Watchers on The Wall 4.0 S8 The Bells 8.05 **+0.1 (Men)** S1 Baelor 1.09 S2 Blackwater 2.09 S3 The Laws of Gods And Men 4.06, The Mountain and The Viper 4.08 S5 Hardhome 5.8 S7 The Dragon and The Wolf 7.07 **Favoured by Women** **+0.1 (Women)** S1 The Kingsroad 1.02, The Pointy End 1.08 S2 The North Remember 2.01, The Nightlands 2.02, Garden of Bones 2.04, A Man Without Honor 2.07, The Prince of Winterfell 2.08 S3 Walk of Punishment 3.03, And Now His Watch Is Ended 3.04, Kissed By Fire 3.05, Second Sons 3.08, Mhysa 3.10 S4 Breaker of Chains 4.03, Oathkeeper 4.04, First of His Name 4.05 S5 The Wars to Come 5.01, High Sparrow 5.03, Kill The Boy 5.05, Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken 5.06, The Gift 5.07, The Dance of The Dragons 5.09, Mothers Mercy 5.10 S6 Home 6.02, Oathbreaker 6.03 S7 Dragonstone 7.01, Stormborn 7.02, The Queen #8217;s Justice 7.03 **+0.2 (Women)** S1 Lord Snow 1.03, Cripples, Bastards, and Broken Things 1.04 S2 The Ghost of Harrenhal 2.05 S3 Valar Dohaeris 3.01, The Climb 3.06, The Bear and The Maiden Fair 3.07 S5 The House of Black and White 5.02 S6 The Red Woman 6.02, Book of The Stranger 6.04, The Broken Man 6.07 S7 Eastwatch 7.05 S8 The Last of The Starks 8.04 **+0.3 (Women)** S2 What Is Dead May Never Die 2.03 S3 Dark Wings, Dark Words 3.03 S6 Blood of My Blood 6.06, No One 6.08 S7 Beyond The Wall 7.06 **+0.4 (Women)** S8 Winterfell 8.01, A Knight of The Seven Kingdoms 8.02 **+0.8 (Women)** S8 The Long Night 8.03</TEXT>

    <TITLE>I don #8217;t think there #8217;s ever been a period of more blurred lines between  #8220;serious cinema #8221; / big IPOs like GoT / Star Wars / MCU and peak TV than in the last few years, and I don #8217;t think this helped with the nature of analysing on the end of GoT</TITLE>
    <DATE>2020-05-04 13:27:50</DATE>
    <TEXT> #8203; \*\*Warning  #8211; ranty think out loud thread about cognitive dissonance around this. Not sure how internally consistent my arguments are\*\* One of the things I think is quite an interesting thought process is that if you think of GoT as on the verge of cinema as opposed to TV, a lot of season 8 and the reaction made sense, though it may take years to understand. GoT became this incredibly hard thing to categorise. It was so often spoken about in the terms of the Avengers/MCU and Star Wars franchises, yet we all know those are very different things from GoT. It #8217;s hard not to, especially given the fact D and D had been touted for Star Wars for much of the year. It #8217;s hard not to when two of your cast are off to join the MCU. But Star Wars and the MCU, as a general rule don #8217;t launch in to serious Oscar campaigns for above the line acting/directing awards, though they might for special FX. GoT had an incredible amount of crossover to franchise and other work, and franchise work has had such a crossover to the Serious Acting Oscar Films. Johanssen and Pugh are Emmy nominees one day and in an MCU promo the next, the Thrones cast are doing long promo tours with a host of very present day Oscar winners and nominees (aka Sophie Turner positioned alongside Jessica Chastain and Jennifer Lawrence before she had a time to breathe post-GoT). There #8217;s more views on the GoT trailer than the Parasite Trailer, there #8217;s exponentially more views on the video of the Thrones cast presenting an Emmy together than Dern and Zellweger #8217;s Oscar acceptance speeches combined  #8211; and Dern and Zellwegger aren #8217;t getting standing ovations on top of standing ovations. People spent disproportionate amounts of time analysing Kit Harington #8217;s Jon Snow performance in a way no one was analysing four time Emmy winner Jim Parsons #8217; performance on The Big Bang Theory nor even Adam Drivers #8217; three Emmy noms on Girls a few years before. But Driver went from Girls to Star Wars to Oscar Nominee, one of many examples of crossover. Harington is joining the MCU. Why WOULDN #8217;T our brains go there? How do you not look at Daenerys Targaryen or Jon Snow as superheroes for a happy ending when you can go buy figurines of them (something both adults and children are inclined to do) as the same place as Superman or Thanos? Do we know where the Thrones cast are going to end up? Is, for instance, Dern #8217;s performance in Marriage Story so disproportionately better than the GoT cast at their best? (I love Laura, but I #8217;d argue not particularly). Do we know if D and D are going to be funtime Netflix TV show creators or whether they #8217;ll helm the next Netflix Oscar push? No wonder HBO has no idea whether to make Daenerys and Her Dragons Superhero trailer or play on the complexity of Dany #8217;s journey, or whether to do cute HBO Max ads with Dany standing with Aquaman (played by Daenerys #8217; ex on screen husband) and Wonderwoman . How do you not take Emilia very, very seriously when she #8217;s the female headline of a film the year before over Awards Darling Phoebe Waller Bridge bumbling along as a droid? How do you logistically decide to or whether not to campaign for Gwendoline Christie when people spent more time bemoaning the underuse of her acting talent in Star Wars than they did for Oscar winner Lupita Nyongo in the same film at the same time as she #8217;s fifteenth credited on GoT? Or position a play for Alfie Allen when you hear he #8217;s in an excellent film that #8217;s a Best Oscar contender this year by a director who a hot minute ago was directing #8230;. a Thor movie? How do you discern the D and D hate-train when we see  #8220;I can #8217;t believe he did that #8221; TLJ director Rian Johnson pop up two years later with a Best Oscar Screenplay nomination in a film with quite an opposite reaction? And, going back to  #8220;how seriously do we take franchise stuff #8221;, how do we not in a 24 month period when Black Panther does get nominated and Joaquin Phoenix wins an Oscar for playing the Joker? I don #8217;t know what the answer to this is, and it #8217;s probably not a question that can be answered for today, or maybe not for years. But it #8217;s a messy mental roadmap at this point in time to discern just what GoT is, or isn #8217;t in public consciousness. Will some of the cast springboard to Oscar darlings? Will D and D write Netflix's next Oscar contender? Who knows?</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I could bore you all with a long list of television ratings, Google trends, and various IMDB visitor data suggesting that people still are completely fascinated by Game of Thrones. There's only one show that even comes close with interest a year later, and that's Breaking Bad. The narrative I see on the internet that "no one cares about GoT anymore" just doesn't add up when you actually start researching if that's true. People might not talk about it as much because they feel it's hard to do so without arguments, but there's an abundance of interest in various aspects of the show. \*\*Edit: An exception to the rule is that the engagement on social media is somewhat down for various members of the cast, but a good portion of them don't post much GoT stuff and that's a fairly fickle metric. However, for all hate-train of a small minority on Twitter, the follow rate for the official Game of Thrones account is 8.4 million vs this time last year at 8.5 million percent\*\*</TEXT>

    <DATE>2020-05-12 14:20:05</DATE>
    <TEXT>1. Treat casting like your life depended on it. Choose people who'll stay with you until they need to leave via the story, not so you need to adapt the story to suit them leaving. 2. Shoot more outside of the US. There are some beautiful locations all around the world (also: it may not be the best time to shoot in the US at the moment) plus great facilities and it helps local economies (ie Northern Ireland) 3. Define character looks! We'll all remember Jon and Dany's hair, the Lannister red and gold, Cersei's perpetual wine glass. It helps characters be memorable and iconic. Even if you don't have the budget for big FX, great costumes and visuals are still appreciated. 4. It is delightful to have more than just one female characters whose story is being told in a story. Do that more. 5. Don't ever assume the final book of that cool series you're adapting is ACTUALLY gonna come out.</TEXT>

    <TITLE>Which other characters, given different circumstances, also had high propensity to succumb to their worst instincts, but didn't?</TITLE>
    <DATE>2020-05-13 07:51:28</DATE>
    <TEXT>If we accept that characters like Jaime and Dany succumbing to the worst of their instincts is what got them killed (you don't have to agree with that, but if you accept that argument), who also was at the highest of risk? One of my feelings was perpetually Arya. I think Arya's cool to watch and a fun character, but I've always been a little uneasy with her being painted as a hero at a certain point given what that meant about vengeful killing and a certain coldness attached to it, particularly in seasons 6 and 7. To me, Arya may well have a level of this urge, but what she's learnt - increasingly - is to walk away from it and not towards it. Tyrion's desire for greatness and to be heroic, to always be on the politically winning team very nearly had him dead as well.</TEXT>

    <TITLE>Hypothetically, you have to develop a lower budget single season spin off for HBO because House of The Dragon is delayed by the pandemic and there are $$$ constraints. Using one character/actor, one location, and little to no CGI, what would you create?</TITLE>
    <DATE>2020-05-24 11:28:09</DATE>
    <TEXT>So to be clear this is a thought experiment post (there #8217;s no indication this is a thing  #8211; yet) I just thought it would be an interesting exercise: Let #8217;s pretend that HBO becomes severely delayed on the prequel because of the pandemic  #8211; ie it #8217;s still happening, but it needs some time and they #8217;re seriously budget constrained but they do have access to previous cast members they might not and they decide to do a sequel/spin off (in reality: let's hope it doesn't come to this) **RULES OF THIS EXERCISE** You #8217;re allowed: \-One existing character/actor to carry over, and only one, because budget. You CANNOT recast, so you have to chose whether you chose an interesting character to link to a different storyline, or develop a storyline/arc around that character/actor (you don't necessarily need to make this a one person show, though) \-One season/central storyline, because this is a show to tide over the fandom until a bigger budget prequel can logistically happen (for this exercise  #8211; you get 6-8 episodes) in, say, five years. \-One location, because COVID problems (ie you can check in with Edmure, Gendry at his castle, Greyworm at Naath) #8230;but you cannot move from location to location. \-No resurrections are allowed. \-No significant CGI (aka you can dress people up as white walkers or use real dogs for direwolves, receive ravens and talk about dragons, but you cannot CGI in big battles or dragons) \-You can time jump if you wish (it doesn #8217;t need to be set 2 minutes after the finale) \-You can chose a writer/director if you wish.</TEXT>

    <TITLE>List of post GOT cast projects and current status (updated/updating/feel free to add/clarify)</TITLE>
    <DATE>2020-07-13 16:41:01</DATE>
    <TEXT>\*I know this is incomplete but it's like 1am here (Nathalie, Pedro, etc). Will come back to, or feel free to help. This is projects that were either completed/in post production, not new and upcoming stuff (we could probably do with a thread for that) that is in various states of distribution. Most of it is going to VOD. **Emilia Clarke** * Above Suspicion is completed (a long time ago) Listed as getting a UK VOD release later this month. Despite there being some reports of getting a cinema release by Roadside (which is a Lionsgate division) I couldn #8217;t find any evidence. * Last Christmas has gone to VOD and in most places streaming during COVID. **Kit Harington** * The Eternals  #8211; Listed as in post. Moved to February 2021. You all likely know the deal with wide release Disney. Could move at any time * The Death and Life of John Donovan  #8211; this seems to be completely over theatre wise now and should be in VOD in all regions by now I believe. **Peter Dinklage** * I Care A Lot  #8211; this is a at least in Post Production but doesn #8217;t have distribution yet in any major markets. * The Croods 2 (animated)  #8211; (Dreamworks)  #8211; this is supposed to be out in December. Probably could go VOD. It #8217;s animated. **Lena Headey** * Did a TV pilot for Showtime (Rita) just before COVID hit, shot in LA. At this point there #8217;s no word on this but I would imagine we should know fairly soon. * Gunpowder Milkshake wrapped late last year and has distribution. Has a distribution deal with STX in the US. Is listed as coming out this year but no specific date. I believe STX are test-driving Greenland (with Gerard Butler) which as of next month with technically has a cinema date  #8211; so  #8211; later in the year I guess? This is an action film and will probably be held off for a cinema release. * Twist wrapped late last year and as far as I can tell will go to telemovie in the UK (Sky) and VOD in the US, presumably streaming or VOD elsewhere. **Maisie Williams** OK quite a lot: * TV: Filmed Two Weeks To Live last year. This is definitely getting a release on Sky in the UK. No distribution deal outside UK that I can see, but that's fairly common with Sky Originals I believe. Maisie said in a live interview that this will maybe be out around Oct/Nov but unconfirmed. Has done some light press so might be earlier. * The New Mutants: Obviously this has a wide distribution deal and probably needs to be available everywhere at the same time. Still on the schedule for August 14. Probably will win an award for most delayed film in history, but who knows? * Wrapped The Owners film last year. Has a distribution deal - This is with RLJE who don #8217;t have a big track record in the last few years of much $$$ at the box office. This was slated as concurrent VOD/theatres in April and I suspect will go VOD unless things change. Listed as September release. **Sophie Turner**  #183; Survive is on Quibi. It's complete. You can also watch it on a big screen now through Airplay etc. She is also on one "bit #8221; of The Princess Bride but it really is about 30 seconds and available on YouTube.  #183; Did a film Broken Solider  #8211; completed early 2019  #8211; I don #8217;t think this is going to get any sort of release. Has no distribution deals anywhere or festivals scheduled.  #183; Had another film Heavy shown at the Deauville American Film Festival in France a bit under a year ago. Doesn #8217;t have any distribution deals - these can take a while - but this wasn't a big festival in the first place. **Nikolaj Coster Waldau**  #183; Did a TV pilot post VOD (Gone Hollywood). Has definitively not been picked up.  #183; Has an indie film called The Silencing going to DirecTV in the US on July 16th (so this week). No distribution I can see outside of the US. This is in English.  #183; Exit Plan (also known by multiple other names) came out on VOD/streaming in most regions over the course of the last two months. I have seen this  #8211; it is a bit of a hybrid of Danish/English.  #183; Has a film called A Taste of Hunger (in Danish) which I believe is getting Scandinavian telemovie release next year  #183; The Day We Died (in Danish)  #8211; this has a had a cinema and VOD release in Denmark and I don #8217;t think is getting anything wider. **Gwendoline Christie** This is kind of convoluted. Basically the only person who has much in theatres:  #183; The Personal History of David Copperfield  #8211; probably the closest to an awards contender - this is super convoluted but has been released in the UK and is now at VOD status, is at the top of the box office in Australia and I think is getting a slow release in different regions BUT is owned by Disney/Searchlight in the US and is supposed to be out next month (this is PG and could probably also go Disney+ or Hulu).  #183; In Fabric  #8211; small A24 in the US horror film that is in either first or re-release cinemas in some markets even now and VOD in others.  #183; A Midsummer Night #8217;s Dream  #8211; this is a filmed stage production that was in limited release pre COVID and is popular to the extent of petitions for a digital/DVD release. Got massive numbers on a week of streaming (National Theatre is doing some sort of experiment). Is already in re-release in some theatres.  #183; The Friend  #8211; this is complete as was in film festivals in 2019  #8211; this has a stack of distribution deals including one in the US with Roadside (Lionsgate offshoot)  #8211; will probably? Get a mix of VOD and theatrical releases (apparently Fall 2020) **Alfie Allen**  #183; TV: White House Farm. This also has Gemma Whelan in it and Mark Addy (both in quite big roles) and Alfie in supporting. This has already been on ITV in the UK and Foxtel in Australia and has a deal with HBO Max in the US but I haven #8217;t seen any press that it #8217;s dropped yet? (I binged this. I really liked it)  #183; How To Build A Girl  #8211; this was meant to get a Lionsgate release in the UK but is going to Prime, and it got a very tiny drive-in release in the US which is now complete and I think is going to streaming. This doesn #8217;t have much in the way of distribution deals elsewhere so I think will end up on VOD/streaming (probably Prime)  #183; Night Teeth  #8211; this was a commissioned Netflix film which is listed in post-production but I could have sworn I heard Alfie say in an interview was interrupted (he was filming this in March) Netflix stuff can have quite a long period in production so I would assume 2021 if it is completed.  #183; Jojo Rabbit  #8211; this won Best Adapted Screenplay at the Oscars earlier in the year. This was largely at the tail end of its theatre run right at the edge of COVID and should be on VOD nearly everywhere but I believe is still showing in NZ cinemas because Taika Waititi. **John Bradley**  #183; Is in Marry Me, a Universal film with J-Lo. I think John finished filming some time ago but I saw an interview with J-Lo only about six weeks ago indicating there #8217;s still some work/reshoots on this so I don #8217;t think this is super-close \-Also did a project with Mark Addy - come back to me on this one. **Richard Madden:**  #183; See  #8211; Kit with the Eternals  #183; Had been announced for a (high end and pricey mini series called Citadel) with Priyanka Chopra but I don #8217;t believe there #8217;s any indication this was complete pre COVID **Michelle Fairley**  #183; Is in Gangs of London, which was very popular in the UK (I think somewhat unexpectedly). Should be rolling out in other regions across various providers soon.  #183; Did a show called The Feed which should be on Amazon in most regions but doesn #8217;t looked to have gone to Season 2 **Joe Dempsie**  #183; Wrapped a series called Adult Material for Channel 4 in the UK a year ago so probably isn #8217;t far away. Probably won #8217;t get distribution outside UK as far as I can see.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I will admit to just reading the article and not the thread because 1am here and half watching TV. But - without context of where it started - going to stage door is something that is often somewhat managed by the theatre for photos and autographs, and has certainly happened with GoT cast previously. The show was done very early COVID (before it became apparent how bad it was) and I think from memory it was stated at some point that there wouldn't be any stage door for obvious reasons. Whether this was done before or after I am not sure. Not sure it is something I would do but is something akin to lining up for an autograph at a con.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I appreciate her just coming out and saying it was about the $$$. It's fine. Most shows would kill for someone to stay 15 seasons and ostensibly have no other commitments to work around. Be interest to see what happens when it finishes (in 2032 or whatever). Might have to chase down the podcast.</TEXT>
