    <TITLE>Game crashed and after restarting it twice I still apparently lack all the dlc I #8217;ve bought. All the fun I was having with the Marching Fire characters, excitement for Y3 characters gone. At least I still have Crimson Conquest effects for my Orochi I guess so I #8217;ll take what mercies I can.</TITLE>

    <TEXT>I feel like I #8217;m at my limits now. I have uninstalled For Honor, then tried to reinstall it. That was my first mistake as apparently I #8217;m not allowed to leave my PS4 in rest mode unless I want to risk the installation going haywire. Three attempts later over the course of two days and now I #8217;ve finally got For Honor, but I didn #8217;t feel relief. Just this overbearing feeling of defeatism, I had this gut instinct telling me that it was pointless and you know what, reinstalling wouldn #8217;t do a damn thing for downloading the Live Update. It didn #8217;t do a damn thing in downloading the Live Update, before where usually it would roughly reach 23%, now it only goes as far as 13% before telling me the usual crap about the Live Download failing. three years and now ive got this mess throwing a wrench into my addiction. Should I just give up on For Honor at this rate? If there #8217;s any way to get back online and play I #8217;ll gladly do it. I just can #8217;t bear with this crap any longer.</TEXT>

    <DATE>2019-11-24 12:11:30</DATE>
    <TEXT>Heed this warning, possible spoilers for Fallen Order- if you haven #8217;t finished the game turn back! It #8217;s a question that #8217;s been on my mind ever since finishing Fallen Order, I haven #8217;t touched the series since the first three movies came out, that being 45 and 6, so my friends filled me in on some barebones details. Here #8217;s a little scenario for you; say you #8217;re a Jedi Master- not a Padawan turned Knight, but an experienced vassal of the Jedi Order alongside a small group of survivors fresh from Order 66, where would you lead them to not only protect them- but train the next- and while as grim as it sounds, the likely final generation of Jedi at your current point in time. How would you rebuild the Order, would you try to discreetly leave clues for other Jedi to join your safe haven or keep to a hermetic lifestyle to protect the varying padawans and younglings who look up to you for guidance? Ahead of time, I #8217;d like to apologise if this discussion does not reach the standards of rule two. In the case that my post for discussion seems a little lacking.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Who here just loved some of the combat system in this game, and all the fights! From the way Second Sister would mock and taunt you to throw you off your game to even the legendary Ogdo Bogdo gracing you with his might. I just wanted to know while the idea may not occur at all, what is everyone else #8217;s thoughts on maybe a big old arena mode similar to be caught by Greeze #8217;s debtors. Then to fend for your life in a survival mode. Just endless foes coming at you with limited moments of respite! Just imagine challenging your friends to beat your time and kill count in that arena, facing off bosses who grow stronger and tougher with each time you fought them! I know I #8217;m babbling but damn if the prospect ain #8217;t appealing. What are your thoughts?</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I dig the pose and addition of the armour, in my eyes there #8217;s too little of people drawing a character in their get up. Just nothing but a helmet more often than not and I #8217;m happy to see that isn #8217;t the case in this scenario. Their breasts appear to be affected by gravity at the very least helping them feel natural but I can #8217;t help but feel something uncanny looking at the Peacekeeper #8217;s rightmost breast. The position where it is elevated as if she were resting it on a desk - understandably this is likely the male #8217;s leg. The lighting is well done though a little confusing in the way it stretches across both their faces as if it were between them and not in the backdrop of the image. In the end, I enjoyed this sketch you have made and look forward to seeing more images coming from you.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Not bad but much alike to the rather crude points the others have, I disagree with the abnormal size of the bush. There are of course exceptions to this natural growth #8217;s size and pattern of the pubes. Though normally when body hair grows around toned muscles they have a tad more defined growth around its edges. Again there are exceptions, but in this picture it is rather uncanny in the way the hair symmetrically grows off balance to the abdominal crack #8217;s direction. It #8217;s just one glaring negative that seems to have taken a number of people by storm, like using the wrong screw for a hole. The pose is to the point and you giving your hand at muscle definition and toning is definitely a step up from a sketch no matter the effort. I just had a look through your previous works and can say that there #8217;s definitely an improvement of sorts - perhaps on that part it is due to the more heavily built stature of J #246;rmungandr in comparison to the more ectomorphic body types of both a Nobushi and Peacekeeper. Good work, the pubic hair is a bold move (General Midaki) in your recent works. Your artistic abilities remind me of a certain someone I used to follow backaways away during the first year of For Honor. So that might be relative to why I #8217;ve invested a renewed interest in your work.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>It #8217;s a little tight don #8217;t you feel? The constraint you have when you can only lug around that one three star corpse, and leave behind that fine looking three star Elk for coyotes to sneak away with? Well with the only other brain cell bouncing around my primate brain do I have something of a solution for you! Using your lasso rope to break in a sturdy horse, you can ride around the wild horse and throw big stinking, fresh bodies on the back to deliver to Cripps! I #8217;ll warn y #8217;all now however that smaller varmint like raccoons and rodents won #8217;t fit on the horse for a rather specific reason, why- you need a saddle on that horse to stow those little critters away for the big sale! Now giddy on out there! I know y #8217;all have been eyeing that pair of gloves in the General Store.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>It worked perfectly fine the last hundred times I booted this game up on my PS4, I can #8217;t even remember the time I manually logged on as I #8217;m guessing it signed me in with me being a PlayStation player. But now, right now that is I #8217;m constantly just being shutdown hard in the title screen.  #8220;You must have an account to play! #8221; It says, well I bloody well wonder how the hell I got the battle passes, earned achievements and managed to enter the bloody menu screen if I couldn #8217;t even get into the menu screen. Season 4 and prior all the way back to game launch I #8217;ve never had this problem, and now this happens. Christ above I just want to play the game.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Why is it that it feels like there #8217;s only ever one solution to this game #8217;s tweaking?  #8216;Let #8217;s make this guy attack faster. #8217; And while I #8217;m complaining, let me just say I #8217;ve been maining Orochi since back in open beta. So what exactly is it that #8217;s pissing me off? People that abuse it are no problem, they #8217;re just bastards who fucking rely so badly on feats and teammates to compensate for their lack of ability to parry or block. But by God do I keep my fucking calm,  #8216;there #8217;s always next game, you can do better next time, at least you can look back and see what you can improve on! #8217; Ah yes because I #8217;m supposed to improve on this fucking Highlander turtling so hard you could fire a fucking missile at him and he #8217;d crushing counter it with a light attack. I #8217;m left screaming my lungs sore, a rather easy thing to do given that I haven #8217;t screamed that much since I had an emotional meltdown. Why the fuck does it feel like heavies, Jormungandr for example move faster than I do!? How about the hybrids, then? Zhanhu, could probably be a heavy attack from him and I wouldn #8217;t be able to tell the difference. Oh, other assassins? Well let #8217;s just take a gander at Peacekeeper and Gladiator then you #8217;ll have answered your own fucking question. And by fucking God #8217;s name the damn vanguards, because of course Raider can land a heavy OOS that I #8217;m not allowed to block or parry. Of course I #8217;m not allowed to soft feint my top heavies like Kensei or God forbid if my light attacks can even match hers. I hate this so much, I remember back when Orochi #8217;s backstep was a heavy attack that was delayed. When storm rush came from one direction. God I fucking miss those times, even if it came with the P2P.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>So today I was browsing through and about, and came across something called the Andromeda Elite helmet? Is there any way to re-enter the old training hub, because I remember taking a hiatus from the game after a disagreement with irl friends. In short, I #8217;d like the helmet- and more if there #8217;s an armour set. And I #8217;d like to know how to go around getting it three years past the game #8217;s release.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Decent take on the point of view, Lynx playing with her badonkadonk would probably be better complimented if her head were craned a little more to the viewer alike to making eye contact. It #8217;s good to see someone not turning a nice cock into a SWAT door breaching hammer. CTL I have little to speak of, the angle of her head although cropped off, the angle where you can see that she is somewhat faced to the viewer is appreciated, I personally feel that stroking the nice cock would be better if she were holding it in reverse grip (thump pointing to body) but that #8217;s just a subjective opinion. Nice cock could do with a bit more of a dynamic angle, either leaning to left or right but is not a major complaint. Good work.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Kiss: Peacekeeper because one I #8217;ve got a fetish for kissing, and two because they were hyped up to be basically spies who could blackmail kingdoms and make crowns fall. Like, an experienced lover like that why wouldn #8217;t you kiss them? Fuck: Since this is going to be a more carnal pursuit than it is intimacy with the Peacekeeper, I #8217;m going to roll with either the Nobushi or the Aramusha. A rugged warrior on the road with a cheeky leer on his face, or a woman armed with both elegant words and a deadly blade greeting you into her home. Either one is a great cause for appeal. And finally marriage: This would be a complicated scenario, but after some thorough deliberation - Kensei would likely be my best bet. I don #8217;t say this in the manner of a gold digger, but it #8217;s instead the confidence of a leader that attracts me. Someone who can inspire you to keep moving on is the person I would gladly spend the rest of my life with, their refined upbringing and disciplined lifestyle would be a difficult adjustment but one I am willing to take the time to learn. As all should be aware of, changing yourself for someone you love isn #8217;t something that *should* be encouraged, but it #8217;s an act of appreciation in of itself.

    <TEXT>You could do with a bit more formatting, specifically mentioning or implying that she was thinking it could have been done using * #8217;italics #8217;*. Don #8217;t forget about spacing things out in paragraphs either, since that #8217;ll make it easier for some readers to go over your work. You could use a bit more work with the sentences that come from different characters but that #8217;s nothing a little structure won #8217;t fix. And as a suggestion, I think you shouldn #8217;t extend/exaggerate certain words like  #8216;ohh #8217; and  #8216;fuck #8217;, since these could simply be drawn out with a descriptive sentence like, `Alibi was driven over the edge with pleasure, her lips trembling as she struggled to make a sound over the sheer sensation that filled her,  #8220;*Oh, fuck~.* #8221; Not bad for your first fanfic, I look forward to seeing you improve.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Not a bad job all things considered, ignore the rest of the people in the comments. Chances are they can #8217;t fight a Warmonger and take their anger out on forums. The shading threw me for a bit of a loop and her breasts while yes those jugs are massive - they clearly have weight and aren #8217;t floating at least to some degree. I #8217;m personally more into svelte and lither body types, but I #8217;m not going to throw shade simply because we hold on to different attractions. Sadly however as I #8217;m not too well versed in plus-sized women, I can #8217;t offer the greatest of criticisms. A bit more muscle definition in some areas (abdominal region, upper thigh) might be something that #8217;ll help to quell the wrathful nerds, but art isn #8217;t to attend to the eyes of others over your own. In terms of armour I actually don #8217;t have as much criticisms, aside from how the tasset isn #8217;t large enough to protect the hips - but I understand that it would have detracted from the value. The chainmail skirt could use a bit more work when it comes to shadowing, maybe an implied imprint where the plate greaves/chausses have a couple centimetres of space between the skin? I #8217;m currently occupied with other matters, but I hope my amateurish eye was a helpful point of view.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Eight hours ago my PS4 was working fine, I had a loss online in a match and took a nap to cool off. But before leaving to take the nap, I tried to play another game. Then it told me that the game was corrupted, this confused me since I was playing it forty minutes before. So I did what the error message told me to, deleted and reinstalled. But then the download also went down too, saying the data was corrupted. I was getting frustrated, and had a good feeling I #8217;d need to restart the PlayStation, go into Safe Mode and rebuild the database, so I went and did that. Now here we are at this very screen.  #8220;Cannot start the PS4. #8221;  #8220;Connect the DUALSHOCK 4 using the USB cable and then press the PS button. #8221;</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I got even more heated and decided to take a nap, the sun has gone down and I went back here to find my PS4 still in this state. Let #8217;s get into the crap I #8217;ve done so far to tackle this problem. - I changed USB cables, all of them are working properly and can charge Android devices with no hassle or fancy gymnastic positioning to start charging. (Total of three cables.) - I have used all existing ports available, the two at the front and the one at the back next to the HDMI slot. - My problem is not to do with any update, 8.00, 7.50, 7.00 - although I have been forced to reinitialise and rebuild my PS4 20+ times. - My PS4 came into my possession after 24th of March, 2015. Bloodborne was among the first games I played and the most memorable. Roughly speaking my console is around five years give or take, not counting production in whatever factory it came out of.</TEXT>
