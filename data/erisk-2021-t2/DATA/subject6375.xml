    <TEXT>I seriously understand you. I'm gonna be 15 in a few days, and its gonna suck. literally, idk what's fucking wrong with me. I cant go a single night without thinking of suicide and I cant stand the thought of literally the future at all. It's already so hard for me to stay caught up in school and I'm already struggling with something i shouldnt be having issues with and it only overwhelms me more to think about the fact that I have to do pretty much that when I'm older, *if* I'm older, except then I will have to support myself</TEXT>

    <TEXT>it's nearly 4:00 in the morning and I am finally able to do some homework that I need to catch up on and I finally found the motivation to do it, *and the page has been "trying to connect" for the past literal 10 minutes.* my wifi isnt bad, ever. I can play online with friends or be on discord and even be on google discs on a personal device just fine. but the *one* device that's sucks just so happens to be the one I need. and yeah, I tried reloading the page :(</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I'd say theres a very good chance hes not. think about it, how do we know that anything we read about him is true. probably just a normal story about a normal guy that got twisted up over the time through translations. also, given that there are so many other religions, even if one was real, what are the chances that it's one with god?</TEXT>

    <TEXT>so, I have seasonal allergies. but they're not bad, and I rarely notice them. unless, it's my birthday. today's my birthday and I could have had a friend over, but instead I've been sleeping all day. all fucking day. also this is my 3ed year in a row only getting allergy symptoms on just my birthday. it fucking sucks. the one day of the year where I can just chill and do whatever without being bothered, for the past *3 fucking years* has been spent with a soar throat / no voice / not being able to breath because my sinuses (?) are either too clogged or just breath 'cold' that feels like it's not actually making you breathe. since I've been sleeping all day, I have a head ache. fml, i swear, this better not happen next year</TEXT>
