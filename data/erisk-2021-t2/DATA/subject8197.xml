    <TEXT>A few of mine, around 6 months, are the same colour but they started out really red so I think yours are just like mine and fade really slowly. I read somewhere that scars fade until they're around 2 years old (this info could be wrong though)</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I can't really tell from the post (it's probs my eyes, not the picture, I have a bad eyesight) wether the red is scar tissue itself or an underlying infection. (When cuts get infected a red hue surrounds them which is why I'm worried, if they are infected please take good care of them.) If it's just red scar tissue they'll fade after a few months. I have one on my thigh that's six months old and was red the first 4 months (now it's a darkish purplish red colour) so just wait a bit more, they'll probably fade over the next few months. Have a nice day and I hope they'll fade and get lighter :)</TEXT>

    <TEXT>If you hit styro or deeper and the cut is quite wide, you can create your own steri strips out of regular bandaids. Be careful with these though because while steri strips are designed to fall off on their own after the right amount of time has passed, the self made ones don't. Don't remove them too soon or you'll reopen the yeets. If they don't need steristrips and you want to save your regular bandaids to make steristrips, you can use toilet paper or paper kerchiefs, be sure to use clean ones though, don't take ones from dirty public bathrooms or something or you'll end up with a nasty infection. You can keep the toilet paper in place with bandages (either you save for bandages or you try and take some from your first aid kit at home if you have one or from a school's doctor office) or with your clothes or bracelets/hair ties/elastic bands depending on where you yeet. Make sure to often replace the paper kerchiefs so that the dressing stays clean enough to not infect the cut. Keep in mind that if you use these you'll have to check often to see if you don't bleed through. Something you can't forget is to disinfect your wounds, if possible, use disinfectant, if not, at least use water and soap. Be sure to rinse the skin thoroughly so that no soap residue remains in the yeets.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Oh btw, just found out that apparently it's bad to use toilet paper on yeets since it can easily break down and littles pieces can get into the yeets and you'll need tweezers to get them out. So please, don't use them if you can use real medical supplies but if you do use toilet paper or anything similar, be careful. I haven't had that happen to me yet so I can't give any tips on how to avoid it breaking down but I thought I'd still warn you so you'll stay safe.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>What it feels like? Good at first, it gives you a relief you can't phantom yourself getting anywhere else but then the guilt sets in. And the self hate and shame follow quickly. All you can think is "what have I done?!" And you hope the scars disappear but they don't, they're a permanent mark but in the meantime you want that euphoria again because you feel so so horrible about having done it in the first place, you want to feel better once more. So you end up doing it again. And then you just spiral down the scars multiply and your sense of self loathing deepens, the first few months you were able to still wear regular clothing but then the scars have spread so much you start needing more clothes to cover up, you isolate yourself from loved ones, don't participate in things you used to enjoy until one day you get the help you need or you hurt the people that love you irreversibly. Yet that euphoria you felt wasn't a SH thing only. You can get it from exercising, drawing, laughing your head off, going for a run ... You can get the good feeling it gives you without the negative consequences by coping in a different way. Please stop before you even start because it's not worth it. I'm telling you this as someone who's doing it till this day, I'm not an ex-sh-er that can tell you about how recovery was worth it because I'm too ashamed to get the help I need. I'm telling you this as someone who recognises the problem but can't get away from it. None of this is worth it, it's a dark path and I really don't want any more people to fall victim to it so please, seek professional help. Tell them about the urges you're having. The fact that you're considering it is alarming enough, please seek help and stay safe, we love you #10084; #65039;</TEXT>

    <TEXT>My dude, good news I guess, you have to be 16 to buy alcohol, however, there's no minimum age to drinking alcohol. So if you're with someone that's 16 and you're not, you can legally still drink it, just not buy it. Which also means that if you're 16, you can't buy heavy drinks like vodka, but you can legally drink it if someone else buys it for you.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>One of the things that helps people out is asking others to use pronouns you think you feel comfortable with. Eg. If you were born AMAB and feel non-binary, ask people to use they/them pronouns instead of he/him and see if it feels right. If they don't, maybe you're still cis, or trans. Discovering your gender can take a lot of time and there's nothing wrong with that. Take your time, there's no rush, just do what feels most comfortable.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Whenever I have gym class I make sure to wear something over sized or long to hide my thighs, then I just change my trousers first while using the sweater or shirt to hide the scars. If someone often looks at you, talk while you do it so they focus on your face, if they don't, try to get a spot in a corner of the room so you can stand with your back to the room so your front and sides are blocked from view. To hide the ones on my arms, I pull my arms out of my sleeves but keep them under the shirt, take my sports shirt, put my arms through those sleeves and pull that sports shirt over my head while simultaneously pulling my other shirt off so nothing gets exposed. If you have scars on your stomach and/or chest, just wear a top under your normal clothes and keep that one on while changing. Scars on ankles can easily be hidden by socks while scars on wrists can be hidden by bracelets or a bandana. If you can somehow not do it sneakily consider already wearing your sports clothes in advance so you just have to tug off a sweater or something. If possible, get in the changing room before others, or just change your clothes in a stall in the restrooms. Some changing rooms have one or two separate stalls (sometimes those are showers) just hop in there and change there. Most people wouldn't care to notice or comment on it.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I feel that on a spiritually level. A homeroom teacher is basically a teacher who gets a class assigned to them. They are then responsible for organising events, collecting and distributing documents (like fees, permission slips etc), they are supposed to help when there's a problem between a student and another teacher or student, help you find your way around the school, check in with your plans for university, give advice, ... Basically, they are responsible for a class and the students. They are also supposed to be the teacher that helps with problems that are not necessarily education based. They're sort of a social teacher on top of being a regular teacher.</TEXT>

She was still mad but when I did join the next video chat she didn't ask me to turn on my camera or speak so I think that while she's angry, she at least keeps in mind that I can't handle video chats.

    <TEXT>My parents are actually going to pay for university, there will be no loans. Where I live the government pays a huge part of the school fees of anyone going to university/college so we only have to pay like 1.800 a year. And my parents are probably going to get financial aid making it even cheaper for us. I don't know why my mum does it. She often says "that over there" when referring to me but I don't get it. I once asked her to stop and she said it's just a way of talking. Yet I never heard her talk about my brother like that. Apparently my teacher has the right to say that because she's my homeroom teacher. She has to prepare us for college and giving advice is part of it I guess. I just wished she did it in a nicer way rather than saying I'm too dumb, can't handle it, lazy, ... I mean, she shouldn't have to insult me just to say they advice against it.</TEXT>

I was anxious the whole day, just awaiting the inevitable phone call. I didn't get any. When arriving home, my parents were acting normal. So I thought they hadn't found them, so I went to retrieve them, but they were gone. I don't know for certain but I'm quite sure that the cleaning lady found them. She was there that morning and cleaned the bathroom after I left for school. I wonder, did she know what it was and just didn't care to inform my parents, or did she not notice they were obvious yeeting tools.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Ah no, it isn't. Allow me to elaborate. It was a 10 camp with a youth movement and 2 of those 10 days were survival days. Those days they were dropped somewhere unknown with only a map and had to make their way back to the camp site. They had to find loging, food and stuff like that by themselves. If however, you managed to sneak money past the leaders on the first day of the camp, you were allowed to use that money during those 10 days. Which meant that during the survival days, people with money were able to buy food or snacks they enjoyed while others didn't. As for the other 8 days, if you managed to sneak money past the leaders, you were allowed to go into town with them on certain evenings. I think they went drinking then. Of course after the camp, all the money the leaders had found was given back to the rightful owners. it was sort of an extra game, to see if you could sneak money past them and enjoy some luxuries.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>It depends on the grade you're in. I think the youngest are 6 and the oldest can be any age but most people quit when they're in their twenties. But of course, the survival days and all that are only for people aged 16 or and up. The activities are tailored towards the ages. Youth movements like this one are actually a year round thing. Every Sunday they have an activity (from September to June) and in the summer holidays a camp. During the school year they play games of course but also learn survival tactics and all that. I guess you could compare it to boy scouts.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I haven't confided in them. I don't want to tell them anything without knowing how they'd react. I'd suggest testing the waters with your parents like saying a friend of yours self harms and watch their reaction. If you feel uncomfortable telling them face to face you can try writing a note, leaving said note out for your parents to find before leaving for a friend's house. That gives them an entire day to register and think about it. Some people instinctively react with anger so giving them a day to think about it may help them give a better reaction. In my case my parents kinda tested themselves. My sister had these lines on her arms (they were all criss cross but not scars. She got them from falling against one of those walls that consists out of little pebbles) and my mum thought they were sh marks. The entire family (my parents and three kids) were sitting at the table when she pointed it out. She didn't take my sister somewhere secluded, she didn't wait for my brother and I to leave, she just casually pointed them out at the dinner table. Then my parents just started interrogating her thinking that if she did it she would just admit it at the dinner table. The comments they made were like "you do know that's unhealthy" and "it's kinda dumb to do that, if you feel down just tell us". My sister was clearly confused meanwhile I was silently freaking out cause I was the actual self harmer at the table. Hearing how my parents handled it confirmed to me that no, I would not confide into them. Their reactions had too much disrespect/disgust in them that I'm afraid of their reactions should I tell them.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I think I'm more passively suicidal than actively. I'm only actively suicidal some evenings because for some reason evenings are when I get incredibly sad. And even though I'm actively suicidal, at the moment I'm still too much of a coward to attempt anything. I know everyone can benefit from therapy but where I live, people look down on those that need therapy. I once tried to subtly hint at letting me go to one by giving a different reason (the major I'm going to study in university includes group therapy in the 6th year to see if people are emotionally stable enough to perform the job they're studying for. So I mentioned that I was afraid I'd study for 6 years and then get told I don't have the capabilities, trying to hint that I wanted to go to a therapist to be sure I could handle it. In reality, I wanted to go to the therapist, admit everything, ask them to keep it quiet from my parents and see if I have a mental illness or not.) But my father just nodded and never made an appointment. Idk if I was too subtle or he just didn't want to. My father and mum are a team. He only gives us permission to go out if my mum agreed, if there's something going on, he talks about it with my mum, ... If I were to talk to him, he'd definitely talk to my mum. He thinks it's important we all work as a family, he really loves my mum so I understand why he wants her to know everything. Doesn't make it any easier though. And while my dad is more receptive, I'm still terrified. I had to ask him to change schools which was a pretty serious topic, I kept putting it off for weeks, kept chickening out etc. I think you can already get a bank account before you're 18, I've had once since my 16th birthday I think. Maybe, if you find it really hard to live in your father's house, you can see if the state will legally declare you an adult. Idk the proper procedure but I do know that starting at 16, you can be declared an adult by a court. I hope at least he doesn't look through your phone because that's a big breach in privacy.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>The glass story is actually adaptable to many situations. You can use it like I previously mentioned in stories about a cafe or a storage, if you don't work there, you can say they were placing new windows in a building you were walking past and one of them fell down and the shattering glass ended up harming you (although this can sound really unbelievable). You can say you went on a field trip and a tower of glass or something else fell on you. You can also say you tried to built something and something went wrong when you used an electronic machine (like a shredder like thing or a saw or a drill, really any electronic device used for building can be harmful) and you dropped it or something and had to go to the er because of all those scars. If the scar are not just straight lines but a bit messy, you can say you fell into a rose bush. For thighs you say you tripped and fell in like that, for arms you can say you held them up to your face to protect yourself during the fall.</TEXT>

She immediately grew suspicious and asked about it but I said I actually had no idea where the scar came from and acted nonchalant. She immediately believed me and said "it doesn't even look like how mine used to look so it's obviously not a yeeting scar" like damn, I didn't know there was a specific way they had to look. Like, I'm glad she didn't look further into it but the way she said those words really rubbed me the wrong way. (She has a terrible attitude (I think she has a superiority complex or something) which is why we're not friends anymore and she said those words with her attitude showing through) and then I spent the rest of the week wondering what I did wrong for my yeets to not be "qualified".</TEXT>

    <TITLE>That was a fun day of hiding yeets :) I was certain my teachers or parents would catch me. Sometimes I wish my parents knew so I could at least relax at home but since that includes my parents finding out about all this and the inevitable anger I'll be faced with, I'll just keep hiding them.</TITLE>

    <TEXT>I didn't tell my parents but I did tell someone else. I didn't handle it well at all, I just told here I needed to tell her something and when I got too nervous I just ran home and texted her a picture of my scars. I realise that that was not the right way to handle it at all. It wasn't fair to her to just send such a picture. But she was really supportive and told me that I could talk to her whenever the urge came but I of course never did that. I did however beg her to not tell anyone and till this day, she hasn't. But her demeanor towards me did change slightly. She's way more cautious with what she says around me now and I can no longer make suicidal jokes around her because she'd worry too much. I'd suggest to either talk about it in person, take a moment both you and your parents don't have plans, because it's a long and serious conversation. But, also make sure you can remove yourself from the situation if needed. Perhaps ask a friend if you can stay over if your parents get furious at you. If you're too scared to tell them face to face, consider leaving a note before leaving the house for the day. Write in the note what you do, why you do it and how it makes you feel. Explain why it's a coping mechanism for you and that you decided to finally get help but that them getting angry at you wouldn't help your situation at all and that you really need their support right now. And don't forget to mention that you're safe at the moment and are just going to hang out with a friend or something so they don't worry about your safety or what you could do right now. Leaving the note out gives you parents a whole day to digest the information and it can help you avoid initial anger. That way they can think about it and approach you way more level headed.</TEXT>

But the same day I think we watched a video in English and I knew the video included a part where a dude yote his arm so I told her cause I know how hard triggers are and she asked me to keep watching till it was over?? Like, I don't know if she genuinely believed my obviously fake lie or just didn't care that I now had to watch that scene? But that paired with her words gave me some good relapse fuel. Maybe she didn't see them as legit because it wasn't a perfectly straight line? It curved slightly.</TEXT>

He was the teacher that told me Shakespeare was probably gay but historians are too cowardly to admit it. But now that I sent him the mail, I just began freaking out. Everything began feeling so heavy and like I couldn't handle it. I just suddenly fell down this dark hole and feel so bad. I haven't even accepted myself yet? How could I expect my teacher to accept me for being bi? What kind of Christian though? Some Christians are really open-minded about stuff like the LGBTQ+ community.

    <TEXT>Ah, I don't know if it's the same in other countries but here they advice against studying Psychology if you have psychological issues yourself. Luckily they can't physically stop you nor do I listen to that advise. It's not really him having unhealthy behaviours, it's more like him having a terrible taste in men and me not being happy about it. I mean, I'm not going to stop him from dating, but I did voice my concerns because his date is the wrong kind of man and my friend is quite sensitive. He'll probably end up hurt. Or maybe I'm just being an overprotective mom-friend, idk, I just don't trust his date. (Yes I personally know the guy he's going on a date with which is why I don't trust him with my friend.

    <TEXT>For all of you pancake lovers out there, here's a recipe for low kcal pancakes: Ingredients: 2 eggs 1 banana (if you are allergic to bananas or simply don't like the taste, you can use mashed apples instead) Cooking process: Peel the banana and place it on a plate/in a cup. Take a fork and proceed to mash the banana until it is mushy. Take the two eggs and add them to the mashed banana. Mix the two together. Take out a pan and put it on the stove, take your favourite low cal oil/butter/whatever you use and put a bit in the pan. Take the pancake mix and put two table spoons in the pan (the pancakes will be the small cute kind). Bake the pancakes and continue untill all the dough is gone. You can add some low kcal spreads or eat the pancakes plain. The banana gives them a unique taste. Enjoy.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>That's actually ... A really interesting point, I find it hard to find any counter arguments. I do agree it's not healthy if you think self harm is a great way to do something, wether it's to cope or to get attention. I know I self harm because it calms me down, everything is at peace then for even a moment. But somehow I feel like I'm just faking this pressure I feel right before self harming as if my mind is faking it so I can continue this behaviour? As if maybe I accidentally made my mind believe I have a mental illness without actually having one like a placebo. But your answers are actually really informative. Definitely something I should look into more.</TEXT>

Don't put words in my mouth, read my answer before assuming things. Both anorexia nervosa and atypical anorexia are serious illnesses that shouldn't be taken lightly. Everyone with an ED deserves treatment, I never said you didn't. I explained the difference between the two, I just explaining what the DSM-V says.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>What you think is because of your anorexia (using the term as the umbrella term now) that says you're not worthy of treatment. However when people talk about anorexia, they're talking about the umbrella term. If you ask a random stranger "can people not underweight have anorexia?" They will most probably say yes. The difference between the two isn't all that known nor used in daily life, they're seen as the same illness. I'll try to explain it this way: Let's say I have OSFED, it's an ED rarely talked about but just as life threatening as any other, would that mean that I also don't deserve treatment? Purely based on the criteria of "being talked about", that would be the case. It would mean that even though I could be dying, I don't deserve treatment simply for the fact that you barely hear about it in your daily life. It's the same for atypical anorexia. Just because it isn't often talking about, doesn't mean it's not just as dangerous. When you have atypical anorexia the same dangers are there. Everything that happens in the body of someone with anorexia nervosa, happens in the body of someone with atypical anorexia. The same health risks are there, the same risks of heart diseases, turning infertile, kidney failure, fainting, skin changes, gastrointestinal issues, emotional difficulties, gastroparesis, heart palpitations and so much more. The only difference is the fact that their BMI isn't below the criteria. The criteria of "being talked about" does not indicate the danger of an illness. It actually makes said illness that much more dangerous. Because a patient isn't underweight, they think it's not as big of a deal. They're not underweight so why should they go seek help? But meanwhile they continue to struggle and their condition worsens. While people with anorexia nervosa get treatment because their ED has been spotted thanks to their weight, people with atypical anorexia have not. Their habits keep persisting until ultimately their heart just stops. While the person with anorexia nervosa got help and are slowly getting healthier, the person with atypical anorexia spiraled down until they eventually lost the battle. Mental health experts know the dangers of eating disorders, they are the mental illnesses with the highest mortality rate namely 20%. They would not turn someone away simply because they are not underweight. Every person that goes to a psychiatrist with concerns about having an ED gets taken seriously. Because all ED's are serious, wether it's anorexia nervosa, bulimia nervosa, atypical anorexia, pica, OSFED, ARFID, ... They are all dangerous and every single sufferer deserves help, regardless of weight.</TEXT>

They conduct a psychological examination and when it's clear that the patient cannot be helped to find a happy life, that they'll suffer for the rest of their existence, then they will start the procedure. They have multiple psychological check ups (every week or every month, I don't remember the exact numbers) over around 2 years or more. Also therapy sessions with family members to help them come to terms with it. And then, ultimately, the day of the euthanasia, which is of course painless.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Aight I just looked it up and intuitive eating is "making food choices without experiencing guilt or an ethical dilemma, honours hunger, respects fullness and enjoys the pleasure of eating" it's a sort of treatment. They try to reject the "dieting mentality", learn to make peace with food and learn to turn to inner cues. There's an emphasis on honouring both health and taste buds. So basically it's a program where they try to help you stop feeling guilty when eating, increase self esteem, help psychologically and physically, listen to your body while also being healthy.</TEXT>

My piercing however made me hate it a little less. It makes me feel like the pretty jewelry is actually distracting people from my face and is making me look a little better. You also have a lot of options, there are so many cute designs, it's amazing. (Warning: I do sometimes feel insecure about my piercing, thinking that it would suit anyone but myself so if you get a piercing, you may have some of those days. Yet, if you absolutely love nose piercings, you won't regret it most days.)</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Might I suggest buying a retainer as well? These are see through piercings that you can put in if for example your school/job doesn't allow piercings. If you put in a retainer the piercing appears "invisible" and it looks like you don't have one. If you have bad days where you hate your nose piercing, you can take it out, put in the retainer and the hole won't close. Then, if you're having a good day, you can once again wear the piercing because the retainer kept the hole open.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Niko did an interview with James Marriott where he explained that a lot of his breakdowns are real and that when he feels one coming he turns on the camera because those are the videos that pull in the most views and YouTube is how he pays his bills. He also explained that he wanted to reach 300 lbs and then go on a diet and film that. He actually seems like a really nice guy irl. He was really Nice in the interview</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Don't worry! It was skin-on fish, fish is actually recommended for cats. It contains a lot of Omega fatty acids and other healthy vitamines. We never cook our food in salt (cats can't really digest salt and raw fish is really bad for them) and I only gave the fish, no other human foods. Of course it shouldn't be given to cats on a daily basis but this was the first time he even had a real piece of fish (dry cat food with fish doesn't count and we never give them wet cat food since that's really unhealthy for them) so it's certainly not part of his daily diet. My cat isn't obese at all, he's at the right weight for a cat his size and age. (Before giving cats fish do look up the kind of fish you can feed cats cause some of them are really bad for the cuties)</TEXT>

    <TEXT>This is why I still trust bread (idk if it'll work for you but I hope it does): I only eat bread when it's homemade or from a warm baker (where I live warm bakers make everything themselves, cold bakers order frozen bread and sell that. Do not ask why cause idk) meaning the bread has no conservatives or added sugar (or no sugar except starch if you count that as sugar). Whole grain bread actually helps against diabetes, colon cancer, high blood pressure and obesity. (Read this in a study). The bread I buy has only around 72 kcal per 35 gram which is around the same as 2 rice cakes but you can find bread for even less kcal. I also find that bread is incredibly filling and can help me restrict longer than if I ate rice cakes instead. Bread also has a lot of nutrions which might help if restricting really hurts your body. And the biggest pro: toast, the food of the gods.</TEXT>

My mum does the same, she wants about how her life was so much worse and I should be grateful for everything she gave me so I understand how that makes you feel horrible and like you're not allowed to suffer but that not right. Your suffering is also valid. Also, what she's doing is child abuse. I know you might not want to accept that or feel comfortable talking to someone.
