    <TITLE>Is my approach viable?</TITLE>
    <DATE>2018-05-13 10:25:10</DATE>
    <TEXT>Beginner rated ~1000 on lichess here. I've seen a lot of advices telling beginners to pick certain openings and play them every time. So I did this, and decided to choose somewhat unpopular options. (Here's my selection - White: Scotch(Alapin if 1..c5), Black: Scandi or Modern against e4(still debating though), QGA(possibly Alekhine Defense) against d4) The reason for this is mostly because this way a lot of the time I would be much more familiar with the opening than my opponent and possibly gain advantage from the gap(plus I just don't like being too mainstream anyway :P) And here's my question: Will this work and should I maintain my strategy? Or would using/studying more popular, general stuff(Ruy Lopez, QGD, etc.) benefit me more? (Of course I do know opening doesn't mean much at my level, but studying chess is a long-term thing, and I want to be consistent with my initial choice until I get actually decent and hit, say, 1500 FIDE or something.)</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Since I have zero knowledge in coding, I had to manually scrap numbers from each competitor #8217;s (about ~40 people with fastest PB average. Because fast people may have slower PB and vice versa I needed to check more people than the final product.) WCA page and paste them into Excel to calculate the averages. Then I sorted everyone from fastest to slowest and this was what I got.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Also shoutout to Hyeon Kyo Kyoung: He actually has 7.15 meta-average but It was calculated from only 3 averages from a single competition. The dataset seemed to be too small to represent his actual global speed and that #8217;s why I excluded him from the list. If I include the 2017 results as well, his average becomes 7.72, which would well place him at 9th place!</TEXT>
