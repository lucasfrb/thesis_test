    <TITLE>Type 1 diabetic, HIIT exercises on keto diet</TITLE>
    <DATE>2020-09-18 21:54:43</DATE>
    <TEXT>Hy guys, Sorry for the long post...but I recently started a keto-fasting diet (3 mothns fasting, added the keto part 4 weeks ago) It has been grate for my blood sugars and ins. Dosages also. My truobles began when i went back to training (after the corona brake , boxing and weightlifting) I started having weird reactions when training fasted or with very low insulin, my blood sugar was rising after exercising to the point that yesterday i had to take 4 units of Apidra before brekfast just to cope with the gluconeogenesis from the liver i guess. (Dont know if my muscles are now using less carbonhydrates and because of that i see the rise in blood sugar or is the liver simply creating carbonhydrates to meet the demand) And yes weirdly enouph ih I have a meal with 20gr of Carbonhidrates (5 units od apidra) before the exercise, it all goes back to the way it was before (exercise lowering my blood sugar) Did anyone had similar expirience, Sorry for the crapy english..</TEXT>

    <TITLE>Purposlely overshooting on Lantus - Keto diet</TITLE>
    <DATE>2020-09-20 11:22:25</DATE>
    <TEXT>Hy guys, I've been reading on this subject for a while now, but it's hard to find articles.. Basicly the idea is to overshoot on lantus in the morning, and then throuout the day you make a stady rise in blood sugar with a very low carb and fairly high protein diet (fat consumtion goes without saying) If your BG starts going too low it wont be as fast as with overshooting with apidra so its basicly very ease to notice it ob time. Afcourse bolus insulin is added if you consume a bigger meal than usual or a bit more carbonhydrates . Thia should put your BG in a fairly stady cycle. The main problem i have is how to incorporate high intensity training into the mix because it some times seem to rise BG and some rimes lower it. Also a downside is having to be on a schedule with eating (but having 10 gr of sugar in a pocket is not the worst thing in the world) I was wondering if anyone has any expirience or did anyone tried it.. Sorry for the bad english</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Well no... First regarding the night... You eat more protein..so 3 4 5 hours after dinner they are going to turn to glucose + Lantus is weaker in the last 6 hours of it's cicle... Regards the next 24 hours...you dont know in advance but you know it's going to drop constantly ...so you just i dont know eat an aple or two if you need more sugar before a walk or something like that...

    <TEXT>Well in the morning your corrizol adrenalin etc are rising giving you elevated BG... If you are on a low carb diet some gluconeogenesis might acure also... Something that has worked for me is giving Lantus in the morning instead of before bad... Usualy i set the alarm at 6 inject and go back to sleep to up around 8... It also lowered my night hypos since it kind of has less of a kick in the last 6 hours of its 24 hour cycle</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Well first whats worked for me was giving lantus in the morning... This prevented nigthly hypos because it kind of has less of a kick in the end of the 24 hour cycle... Sekond thin is have some sugar cubes at bed side, the second u wake up have the usual amount its 3 for me cause im on a low carbonhydrate diet but it can be as much as you need... Any way once you get that feeling of "ok i now that 5 is enouph i just have to wait now" it gets easier for me not to eat anything else...</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Well generaly the body becomes imune to caffein when its used regulary..or at least less affected ... Thats why coffe drinkers can drink 5 cups of coffe a day and not feel a thing... Thats also why athletes make breaks when using caffein to boost performance... Similar thing happend to me after my first hospitalization, i didnt drink coffe for 30 days, the first cup after i got out raised ma pulse to the point that i couldnt sit stil and went for a run :)..not a glucose effect but you get the idea.. Im guessing that it was the case with you also... So my advice like with everything else for T1s either you do it all the time and it becomes a part of tour daily routine, so you can predict it or just switch to water or lemonade i guess</TEXT>

    <TITLE>Little or No Bolus insulin</TITLE>
    <DATE>2020-09-21 14:32:40</DATE>
    <TEXT>Hy guys, i Have started Keto diet 2 months ago ,(Trying to be under 20 gr of CH) Since then i dramaticly redused my bolus dosages, Maybe 2U per meal of Apidra, but unfortunately 4 or 5 times a day (for just 2 meals) to cover protein intake. 3 days ago i increased my Lantus by some 20%, in an attempt to cover the proteins that way... (been 24 now i take 30 or 31 U) Funny thing happend... I dont need bolus insulin at all since then.. ,I havent taken it for 3 days now, and my highest blood sugar was 8.1mmol and that was because i ate a bit much on purpose before bed time...you know just in case... At other times i've been under 5.5, and i checked 20 times in 2.5 days... I did however ate 2 times when my sugar was at 3.9 mmol, but only two bites of apple one time and another a handfull of blueberries. Somwhow i had a feeling my BG wouldn't drop bellow that anyway bit just in case... Has anyone had similar expirience with Keto, Or also if anyobe used R insulins on keto diet i would like to hear your expirience</TEXT>

I'm currently in keto , and light exercises had been fairly easy to menage, two bites of apple and im good to go... High intensity is what im currently strugling with, not in terms of performance... But im having a problem anticipating in wich direction my blood glucose is going to go.... Between insulin concetration, gluconeogenesis, adrenalin, cortisol on the last 10 days it has gone both way, some times lowering some times raising my BG. Thebonly pattern that i have notised is that if i train in the evenings its the hypos, and in the morning hypers... Wich is a bit confusing, since i take maybe 4 units total of apidra throuout the day, so you can realy say that in some times i have a much higher insulin concetration... I see that you are in deep on the subject , any advice would be helpfull A litle p.s. i train brasilian jiu jitsu and boxing so the content of energy expenditure can also be dificult to predict before the exercise itself...</TEXT>

It is kind of challenging, and boring on some ocasions...but just stick to it...the god fealling, great BG , energy and yes looks (i lost som 16 pounds, an currently am at 12% fat) are much more revarding than pizza... There are much mire beautifull things in life than junkfood... And the biggest mith is that it gets boring over longer periods... You get used to it...and it gets easier... In any restaurant you can order something more or less keto..some steak or salad... If you are drinking..just go with the white vine..it gets you drunk just as anything else... I cant even get my self to eat pasta or pizza now, since i know what it does to me... A good beginers trick is to leave anything you crave over the week for sundays lunch...one meal a week will satisfy the cravings..and just be a bit more alert in thise 6 hours after... 6h vs 196h a week is nothing... Trust me un 4 5 weeks you'll choose to skip the cheat meal 100%... At least thats my experience.. Keep safe and well</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Its the only thing in the world that works...i know that every one is different but maan did it change my life... Some benefits that i had or have noticed: 40% lower basal 80-90% lower bolus (went from 45U a day to maybe 4-6) Almost no low BG, despite what you may hear about lows on keto becauae of low carbonhydrates ammounts, the low ammount of insulin virtualy eradicates those... No dawn effect.. Stress and adrenalin etc raises the BG much less, i guess because of the empty liver... Overall stable BG, no CH means no sudden peaks, .. The lows are muuuch kore easy to handle, before if i got to 4.3 - 4.5 i was allready dizzy, now i can go as low as 3 and not have any problems at all...i do feel it and have time to correct wich is nice... ... It takes some time to get used tho..
