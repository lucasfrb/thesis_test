    <TEXT>Yes, between the seventies and the eighties Italy was rather in love with heavy cream. I'm from Emilia-Romagna and as a kid I definitely ate this kind of dish several times, maybe with less ingredients (like no dried thyme) and with ham instead of bacon. We usually have two different kinds of heavy cream, one is fresh, mainly for whipped cream or other dessert, the other (UHT) is only for cooking and it is much much thicker. You are not supposed to boil it so much. The other difference I see is that for our taste probably those mushrooms are still raw. With respect to USA, on the average we like our vegetables either raw (in salads) or very well done (aka not crunchy).</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I've seen this recipe in the past. I still have to find the courage to try this or the traditional one. I just want to remark that here the most important thing is that butter should remain visible in little chunks (pea-sized pieces, as said above) in the first stage. In practice, instead of a whole butter layer as in the the traditional recipe, here we should have a lot of micro layers. If the butter is completely mixed with the other ingredients we will not have layers at all. If done well, I imagine the result should be at least comparable with the traditional one.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>We love this rice-based dessert, which only incidentally is without flour and without butter (apart for the pan). It is a traditional non-cake "cake" from my region. Recipe (sorry for non-USA measures and I'm going by memory, I hope it is correct): in a 1.5 litres of whole milk flavored with a vanilla bean cut in half or with vanilla extract slow boil 375g of a non-risotto rice (possibly a glutinous, rounded one) a pinch of salt and 170g of sugar. While it boils add the zest of a lemon and of an orange. Also add 65g of finely cubed candied orange peel. When the rice is cooked, soft and has absorbed all the milk let it cool down. Then mix 6 whole eggs with the rice and if you like you can add a little tumbler of cognac or rum to mixture. Pour the mix in a buttered cake pan in such a way it is about 1.5 inches thick. Optionally you can throw on the surface some almonds or some pine nuts. Cook in the oven at about 350F (180C) for about 45-60 minutes (until the surface is golden, not burnt). This dessert is usually cut in lozenges and at the last moment you can sprinkle it with sugar, powered or not, if you like it . Usually it is even better the day after it has been cooked. If you want you can serve it with some simple warm chocolate ganache (dark chocolate melt in hot heavy cream with a hint of honey, but I don't know about gluten-free chocolate), on the side. In case you want to scale down the recipe: 1 litre of milk, 115g of sugar, 250g of rice, 50 g of candied orange peel, 4 eggs.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I would not say that one type of lasagna is more traditional than the other. It is just that each Italian region has its own variation on the recipe, whose common name is "lasagne al forno" (lasagne cooked in the oven). For example, in my region it is common (at least since I was 5, so 50 years ago) the version with bechamel, ragu' alla bolognese., and parmigiano. No ricotta, no mozzarella, no other cheese. In the south of Italy you can find recipes which actually include small meatballs, like "lasagne alla napoletana". In the center of Italy (Marche) lasagne al forno are called [vincisgrassi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vincisgrassi) that are still based on bechamel and a kind of ragu', but with some variations with respect to classic ragu' alla bolognese. And so on and so forth... I like the great variability of our cuisine....</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Determining a polynomial of degree n is equivalent to determine its n+1 coefficients. This requires to specify n+1 constraints about these coefficients, because in general a linear system with k unknows is determined if you have k equations. For example, if your unknown polynomial is y=ax^(2)+bx+c, knowing it must pass by point (p,q) gives you the linear constraint in a,b,c q=ap^(2)+bp+c. Knowing that the slope at a certain x=t is d is another possible constraint, 2at+b = d. Clearly if you know that at point (p,q) you have slope d, this amounts to 2 constraints, because you impose that the polynomial passes through (p,q) *and* that the slope at x=p is d. You can combine various types of constraints (for example, if the polynomial has degree  gt; 2, you can impose the value of the second derivative at a certain x), but you need n+1 constraints. If you have less constraints, this will lead to an underdetermined linear system. Solving that, you will normally find not a single polynomial but a family of polynomials depending on one or more parameters. For example, if you look for a quadratic polynomial but you have only 2 constraints, you may end with a family of polynomials described by y=(h+2)/3 * x^2 + 3h * x + (7-h/2), where h is an arbitrary parameter. Imposing conditions on slopes is commonly done in spline interpolation, which roughly speaking, is a piecewise interpolation of many points using distinct low degree polynomials (say cubics) for each piece, and using condition on slopes where the pieces touch to have smoothness.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>It's not a claim, it is a warning: even if P=NP wait to see if the algorithms are practical before declaring the end of civilization... Well, my unsupported feeling is that there are a lot of NP-complete problems, several of them of practical interest, and a lot of very smart people has searched for efficient algorithms for many of them for many years, even before the whole P vs NP matter did arise. It seems not impossible but just improbable that everybody missed these polynomial and practical algorithms if they exist.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Android user here. I simply use Chrome to browse Reddit and I have this issue with a lot of video/gifs. The easy way to get around this is to long tap the (usually void) thumbnail of the video and when Chrome propts you choose either "show in another tab" or "show in an incognito tab". In that way Chrome opens a tab in which the gif/video appears correctly. I usually choose "open in an incognito tab" because in that way it is shown immediately, otherwise it open it in another tab, but still show the current one.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>The point is that when you are a researcher in a field, you are already "engaged": you read that book or that paper because you want to learn something. It's your job and/or passion, not something that is forced upon you. The attitude of a researcher could be and usually is quite different from that of a student. Even if the author of a book really want to add captivating boxes with interesting related facts, it is much more easy to do so in a very advanced book about molecular biology or physics of materials, than in a mid-tier math book on elliptic curves on p-adic fields.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Many times, but these two, while not in the exact same vein, were more hurtful. I don't give many details mainly because I forgot about them. This happened well before Internet made easier to look for already published results. I'm a th.comp.sci..In the first case, we found an error in a proof (I think in computational complexity, probably something about linear algebra and/or parallelism) in a widely cited paper by a famous author, so we wrote a short note in which we addressed the issue and we found an alternative correct proof. The editor of the journal replied that the error was already well known "in the community" even if a correction had never been published (a thing that happens), so he rejected our note. In another case, for an article we were writing we needed to prove that it was possible to factorize in a certain way a symmetric matrix over Z_2, or something like that. My older and much more experienced coauthors did not remember to have seen such a result. So, I was quite excited to have found a proof. While we were polishing the rest of the paper, I went to the library to search for a reference and I was mindlessly browsing a random old bounded volume of SIAM Journal on Discrete Math., when I stumbled upon a paper proving exactly "my" result. I confess that for a minute or two I played with the idea to tell nothing to my coauthors, but then honesty prevailed.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>This is more suited to /r/learnmath and probably will be deleted since this is the wrong subreddit. Anyway, the probability to obtain **exactly** k of a specific number when rolling a s sided dice n times is: (1/s)^k * ((s-1)/s)^(n-k) * binomial(n,k) where binomial(n,k) = n! / (k! * (n-k)!) The (1/s)^k accounts for the fact that you want to have k of a specific number and each occurrence has probability 1/s. The ((s-1)/s)^(n-k) accounts for the fact that you want to have n-k dices with **anything but** the specific number, so each has probability (s-1)/s. The binomial(n,k) accounts for the fact that the order does not matter: the k "specific value" can appear in any of the n dices. For s=8, n=5, k=3 this gives 490 / 8^5  #8776; 1.4953 %. If you want the probability a specific values appears **at least** 3 times, you need to add the above formula for k=3, k=4, k=5 obtaining about 526/ 8^5  #8776; 1.60522 %. For the second part the computations are more cumbersome and there is no way I'm going to do them. But doing that in any computer language (not excel...) is a no brainer. In Mathematica it tooks a line of code to get the following table. To obtain the probability (between 0 and 1) you must divide each number by 8^5. {BBBBB, 32}, {BBBBC, 80}, {BBBBF, 160}, {BBBBH, 240}, {BBBCC, 80}, {BBBCF, 320}, {BBBCH, 480}, {BBBFF, 320}, {BBBFH, 960}, {BBBHH, 720}, {BBCCC, 40}, {BBCCF, 240}, {BBCCH, 360}, {BBCFF, 480}, {BBCFH, 1440}, {BBCHH, 1080}, {BBFFF, 320}, {BBFFH, 1440}, {BBFHH, 2160}, {BBHHH, 1080}, {BCCCC, 10}, {BCCCF, 80}, {BCCCH, 120}, {BCCFF, 240}, {BCCFH, 720}, {BCCHH, 540}, {BCFFF, 320}, {BCFFH, 1440}, {BCFHH, 2160}, {BCHHH, 1080}, {BFFFF, 160}, {BFFFH, 960}, {BFFHH, 2160}, {BFHHH, 2160}, {BHHHH, 810}, {CCCCC, 1}, {CCCCF, 10}, {CCCCH, 15}, {CCCFF, 40}, {CCCFH, 120}, {CCCHH, 90}, {CCFFF, 80}, {CCFFH, 360}, {CCFHH, 540}, {CCHHH, 270}, {CFFFF, 80}, {CFFFH, 480}, {CFFHH, 1080}, {CFHHH, 1080}, {CHHHH, 405}, {FFFFF, 32}, {FFFFH, 240}, {FFFHH, 720}, {FFHHH, 1080}, {FHHHH, 810}, {HHHHH, 243}.</TEXT>

Personally, the thing I always found surprising was the predominance of multiple-choice tests in USA education (at least according to my sources). In my whole student life (here in Italy) I think I may have seen at most a handful of such tests. All the other times, and especially in math, it was important to justify the answers, and in math to show the full reasoning. In that way the teacher could discriminate between a simple typo error and a conceptual one, and evaluate your exam accordingly (and also have feedback about the teaching).

    <TEXT>I'm a (once more theoretical) computer scientist, not a mathematician, but I think refereeing process is similar, since I've also published on border-line journals like "Mathematics of Computation" and "Linear Algebra and its Applications". In my experience as a referee I've never checked social profiles of authors. I simply do not care at all what people do in their free time. What I did sometimes (in particular in the case of conference submissions from a certain country) is to check the authors' list of publications, because it has happened more than once that the authors submitted essentially a copy of one of their papers previously published or presented at a conference, which was (clearly) omitted from "previous/related works" section. Curiuosly, sometimes the duplicated papers only retained some of the original authors. I'm not a champion of English myself (and indeed writing is not my task usually), but I've seen submissions so badly written that sometimes a few well-written sentences were so atypical, that searching them with Google I found they were copied verbatim from papers of other people..., not just theorems enunciates (which may happen), but pieces of the introduction or related works. Funny thing, sometimes they plagiarized even the typos... So I do some sleuth work to identify papers easy to reject, but not about the life of authors.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>The fact that he will not say if he understands or not is not a big deal, since a lot of non-mentally-disabled students do the same and in any case you can't trust them when they say they understand. I think you have to use simple exercises or questions along the explanation to check if he is following, without asking him directly so. With a full class it is difficult or impossible, but with a single student it is doable, even if it requires a certain subtlety if you want to avoid that he feels to be always under scrutiny. The main difficulty I've seen challenging the less proficient students it is an inability to generalize even some simple concepts and methods, a thing that usually stems from shaking bases, like wanting to solve quadratic equations when you are still in doubt on how to add 3/7 and 11/28. In general, no doubts should be allowed on simple things, because they become paralyzing. I mean, you teach them how to apply a method to solve a problem or to do a simple computation. Let say you make the examples using natural numbers. Then in the exercise they encounter a rational number or a negative number. I've seen students panicking and simply giving random answers. For example, when solving a simple linear equation like a * x = b * x + c, it does not matter if a, b, and c, are 2,7,9 or 1/3, -4/11, 31, or even sqrt(2), e, and pi. They are just numbers and they obey the same rules, but this kind of simple abstraction is difficult to grasp immediately for some people. I don't know the level of your student, but I would work a lot on the bases. Like, he should be totally relaxed doing arithmetic.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Probably this photo was taken early or late, when the park is probably empty, but depending on where you walk, you can encounter just few people. For about a year I went walking in the park almost weekly, because in car it's about 30 minutes from home. The park is large for our standards (probably small for USA standards...) but only a fraction of it can be visited because the rest is a natural reserve (in particular you cannot reach the sea). Years ago it was open only on Sundays and festivities, now it should be open every day, but there may be some further restrictions during the weekdays. There is a piece of asphalted road (maybe the one where this picture was taken) which is closed to cars, and most of the people just walk there, often with kids and bikes. If you go along other paths you will meet only few people, especially in fall and winter. Some rainy days I walked around for 2 hours without see anybody.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>There is not such a thing. Up to reasonable limits, say 10^18, one can list all the prime numbers in a certain interval by means of a sieve, either [a Sieve of Eratosthenes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sieve_of_Eratosthenes) or another sieve, for example the [Sieve of Atkin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sieve_of_Atkin). A fast implementation of the Sieve of Eratosthenes is provided by [PrimeSieve](https://github.com/kimwalisch/primesieve) by Kim Walisch. An efficient implementation of the Sieve of Atkin [primegen](http://cr.yp.to/primegen.html) was provided by D. J. Bernstein, but I think that now it is superseded in terms of efficiency by Kim Walish program/library. When the range in which one wants to generate primes becomes larger a full sieving becomes impractical as you can learn by studying the properties of the sieve of Eratosthenes. I've not explored this topic in deep, but I imagine one can mix a bit of sieving (for excluding numbers with small prime factors) with some primality testing. There are a lot of possibilities and implementation and you have to explore and find the one that better suits your needs.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>As a past owner of a crazy cat, I can testify this cat has not bad intentions. For almost 20 years we had a siamese probably of not pure breed, that for some years had moments of violent madness, only at night, when I was a teenager. The scene was the following. I wake up during the night and decide to go drinking some water from the fridge. The cat (no name, it was only called "the siamese cat", even if at that point we had just one) stalked me, then he tried to jump in my face. When I protected myself with my hands he started to bite them, while at the same time kicking them and my arms with posterior legs and scratching with anterior ones. These tantrums were brief and maybe after 3 minutes he insisted going to sleep in my bed, but left me bloody and a bit traumatized. Cat scratches and bites hurt like hell. Luckily the attacks were quite rare, say one every two months or less and I'm a big fan of disinfectants, so I never had infections. I loved my pet so much so I've never considered to take actions against it. During the day, and most of the nights he was very sweet. I actually downplayed the attacks with my parents for fear they would do something.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>This is a well known heuristic for the Euclidean TSP, i.e., a TSP where the "cities" are point in the plane, all are connected, and their distances are proportional to the Euclidean distance between them. While this is a very restricted version of TSP, in practice it is also quite useful (for example, to find the fastest route of a robotic drill that has to make holes in a metal plate) and has been extensively studied. In practice you first compute the [convex hull](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Convex_hull) (a subtour that contains the "most outside cities") then you add the remaining cities according to some criterion. For example, either inserting first the city that increases the less the length of the tour, or the one which is nearest to the current subtour, etc. In general this does not provide a very good tour (I think in the worst case the cost can be 3 times the optimal case, but you have to check for example this article [Worst-case analysis of some convex hull heuristics for the Euclidean travelling salesman problem ](https://booksc.xyz/book/8550545/7adcc3) because I do not remember. There are much better heuristics for the Euclidean TSP, but sometimes the method you propose (or a similar one), it is used to generate a first suboptimal complete tour, a starting point to be improved by a more clever algorithm. Surely it is dated (it's from 1995), but a good starting point on this topic is the 100-page long review [The Traveling Salesman Problem: A Case Study in Local Optimization](http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.70.7639 amp;rep=rep1 amp;type=pdf) by Johnson  amp; McGeoch.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>There are two numbers n such that sigma(n) = 11400, namely 5624 and 9751. EDIT: five numbers... also 10811, 10991, 11399. If the numbers you are interested into are tiny or small (like 11400), then the simplest thing is to use some library (there are some available for Python) or a free program like PARI/GP that in a fraction of a second can check sigma(n) for every n lt;11400 and find the results. In general sigma(k)  gt;= k, so to search for x in sigma(x) = k you have to check only the x  lt;= k. If your target k is larger, then the natural approach to solve sigma(x) = k for some fixed k is the following. First of all, remember that if p1^e1 * p2^e2 * p3^e3 * ... pt^et is the prime factorization of x, then sigma(x) = (1+p1+p1^2 + ... p1^(e1)) * ... * (1+pt+pt^(2)+...+pt^(et)) so, given k, to find the x, if any, such that sigma(x) = k, you can: 1) factor k in every possible way f1 * f2 * ... * fs such that 1  lt; f1  lt;= f2  lt;= f3  lt;= ...  lt;= fs. 2) Then for each such factorization, consider every factor fj and see if it can be represented as (1+q+q^2 + ... q^(h)) for a prime q and an exponent h. This is not difficult since clearly h can not be to large. 3) Then if you have find this pairs (q,h) for each factor fj above, and all the q's in these pairs are different primes, then you have found a number x whose sigma is equal to k. Overall it is not a very difficult function to program, using a bit of recursion.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>The secret is to have solid foundations and be prepared to do a lot of exercise. I've seen a lot of my classmates fail in high school because they had shaking foundations on basic things, like manipulate or simplify expressions. Math becomes utterly harder if one has "holes" on previous topics that lead to doubts/errors on how to proceed, that lead to panic. The other problem is that a lot of people do not (want to) realize that "understanding" a topic is only half of the work. If one does not internalize the concept doing a lot of meaningful exercises, the understanding is almost useless especially when during exams you are supposed to do basic tasks fast and efficiently to concentrate on the difficult parts. Don't you have more proficient classmates you can ask help, like doing exercises together? That can help identify where the difficulties lie. When I was in high school I helped regularly several of my classmates.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Well, if you factor n! into prime factors, and the largest prime factor is p, then you know that p!  lt;= n!  lt; q! where q is the prime following p. So, for example, if the largest prime factor of n! is 37, then n! can only be 37! or 38! or 39! or 40!, because it contains 37 but not 41.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Last year I lost my wife to cancer. We were married 29 years. In the next month I made two short dreams in which she was alive and only at end of the dream I "remembered" she was dead and I woke up. It was really sad. In one we were all together with our sons and her sisters at the house of her parents. Just a normal gathering. The door bell rang and when we open the door there is a dear friend of my wife (the only one who had the guts to visit while she was dying). She says she is sorry but she came to bring my wife home. My wife says goodbye and I remember. In the other we were at the restaurant just the two of us. At a certain point a colleague from work at a nearby table stares at us, then comes to me and wonders : don't you know she is dead? Or something like that. I don't understand, I watch her, my wife makes a sad smile, then gently caresses my cheek and goes away without a word. I wake up crying and still feeling her touch on my face.</TEXT>

In the other cases they cannot be interchanged, but it is true that they are a constant factor apart, so you use the one that it is more suited to your field. In engineering probably you use often log_10 because it gives you immediately an idea of the magnitude of a quantity. In calculus, analysis, etc. you generally use log_e (i.e., ln) because it has nice properties. In theoretical computer science you sometimes use log_2 because in the analysis of certain algorithms it comes up naturally.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>OK, a pentagram is just 1 specific loop. If you want to count all the loops, consider that every permutation can be turned into a directed loop. Say, the permutation 1,5,2,4,3 can be turned into the the loop 1= gt;5= gt;2= gt;4= gt;3= gt;(again)1. Clearly being a loop there is not a "starting point" so you must divide the number of permutations by 5 (otherwise you count each loop 5 times). So the loops are 5!/5 = 4! = 24. And the undirected loops are again half of that, i.e. just 12.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>This is not new. It's the standard elementary way to solve the Diophantine equation a^2 = c^2 - b^2 , where b and c are the unknowns and a is fixed. Since c^2 - b^2 = (c-b)(c+b), both c-b and c+b are divisors of a^2 and the method boils down to loop over the divisors of a^2 (which by the way is slow if a is large and difficult to factorize). For every pair of divisors a^2 = s * t with s  lt; t you then solve c-b=s c+b=t. So, more than a method to "generate" triples, this is a method to find to which triples a given leg *a* belongs.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>People that work in the field of mathematics or sciences usually send their findings/results to specialized journals in the form of articles. The articles are then reviewed by other scientists in the field and if deemed original and sound they are published. Alternatively, the paper can be submitted for presentation to conferences and if accepted after a similar scrutiny they are usually collected in the proceedings of the conference and presented by the author at the venue where the conference is held. Articles can take a very long time to be refereed and to appear, so to disseminate their results faster usually the authors send a preliminary version to arxiv or if possible they publish a preliminary version as a technical report of the academic entity to which they are affiliated. Note that also to have a paper on arxiv one has to be affiliated to some academic entity or endorsed by someone in the field (to prevent a lot of riff-raff to be submitted). To be honest, people outside academia or research institutes quite seldom produce something worth to be published, not just because to find something original in most fields often requires years of preliminary study, but also because to "recognize" that something is new and worth does require a lot of knowledge about a field, a knowledge that it is difficult (but not impossible) to acquire without a structured curriculum and without constant contacts with the world of scientific research. Amateurs that want to preserve authorship in case their findings are new can start with publish things on their own blog or even on Reddit (every post is date-stamped and clearly one can prove the authorship with the password of the user that has posted something). Once something has appeared on the internet in the name of somebody is almost impossible that the result will be "stolen" by somebody else. At least in mathematics. On the contrary it can be useful because in this way one can obtain an immediate feedback and maybe discover that his findings were known since 1950. For example here on Reddit it is quite common to have posts of people that think to have found something new but most of the times (all the times I remember) it is something already well known or just an elementary observation.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I'm Italian. I'm 55. My elementary school teacher was an early adopter or maybe a lonely adopter. Indeed she taught us to perform addition and subtraction in any base. It was a natural thing, after we did understand the concept of positional representation. We had this box of wood blocks in class (the units where cubes 1x1x1, the "longs" where rulers 1x1xB (where B was the base), the "flats" with the pieces 1xBxB , the "cubes" BxBxB. Something like [these](https://collection.sciencemuseumgroup.org.uk/objects/co539029/dienes-multi-base-arithmetic-blocks-1960-1965-teaching-aids-mathematical) but our were colored according to the base, I think (but I may be wrong). And the basics of Venn diagrams for set representation/operations. So inclusion, intersection, union and so on. For these we used the so called (in Italy) "logic blocks" which were these [colorful plastic shapes](https://portalebambini.it/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/blocchi-logici-2.jpg) So we could make, say the set of "triangles" and the set of "red" and find the intersection and so on. One experience I still remember was about "measure" and "measure unit". In practice each of us selected an arbitrary measure unit (a piece of paper). Then we used it to measure the length of our school desk. First counting how many times it was contained whole, the measuring the rest by folding in half our "unit" (a few times). So for somebody the desk was 5 + 1/2 +1/4 for others 3+1/8, etc. which was a way to extend the base representation to fractional values. I really enjoyed it. It was so much time ago that I cannot really remember how the lessons went. But the concepts did stay with me forever. And familiarity with base representation was helpful: I became a researcher in CS... I feel like school once aimed higher. I remember that when we were in middle school (3 years, after the 5 years of elementary school) we were introduced to the concept of proof through elementary geometry. We had to actually prove things starting from known properties, not just computing the area of a trapeze. Sometimes it was difficult, but surely rewarding. Somebody told me that nowadays they do not do proofs anymore in middle school.</TEXT>

I get that being able to do 15 x 6 mentally it may be useful, and indeed is rather easy, but while I played with numbers all my life I never had to do, say, 78 x 39 mentally, not even when calculators/cellphones were not in existence. It is much more important, imho, being able to mentally estimate the magnitude of the result of a multiplication (or any other operation). For precision you can do on paper or with a cellphone or pocket calculator.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>In general, here in Italy we like to cut our own pizza. Unless it is pizza sold by the slice, of course. For this reason pizza at the table is always served with fork and knife and you can decide in how many pieces you like to cut it, and if you want to use your hands or not. Honestly, I would be pissed off in receiving an already cut pizza. It would be a desecration of its beautiful wholeness.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I think the only known nontrivial solutions of this Diophantine equation are 30 = 3^3 + 3 = 5^2 + 5 and 130 = 2^7 + 2 = 5^3 + 5. I think I've already seen it, but I can't remember. A fast small check shows that there are no other such numbers with two representations as a^(x)+a below 4*10^10 . Clearly if this is not a Diophantine equation there are trivially infinite solutions.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>At that level, the usual culprits are (1) shaky foundations (2) lack of exercise. (1) if solving a problem you have even a minimum doubt on how perform a basic step (say, you are factoring a polynomial, but you have a doubt on how to add two fractions), then study back the concept on which you have doubts. Doubts about basic things are your enemies. (2) Lot of exercises, even if you *think* to have understood a concept (3) ask help to your more proficient classmates. When I was in highschool I spent countless hours explaining math and devising exercises for my classmates.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I must admit that I do not know that "MathLab" is... however Most of the math softwares have their strengths and weaknesses (even discounting the fact that some are free of charge and other are quite costly). So it really depends on what you need mostly. For example, Matlab is particularly good for numerical computation on matrices. It is quite fast because it does not work (at least not natively) on symbolic quantities or with numbers in arbitrary precision. Last time I checked there was a open software more-or-less-clone called Octave (at least under Linux, I do not use Windows for "serious" things), not as featured as Matlab, but good enough for a lot of things. The algorithms used by Matlab for linear algebra I think derive from good'ol FORTRAN packages like EISPACK, LINPACK, QUADPACK, etc. so should be very robust. Mathematica and Maple are two programs that have strong symbolic capabilities, like finding definite and indefinite integrals, computing infinites sums, solving parametric equations, and so on. Personally I used both but I strongly dislike the language used by Maple (at least as it was 10-15 years ago, from some examples I've seen, I think the language changed quite a bit). I'm more proficient in Mathematica. Anyway both have a huge number of pre-defined functions and packages to do almost anything. You can check their websites. Also very strong in 2D and 3D visualization of data and functions. Quite costly, if you actually buy them... For more specific math tools one should also check PARI/GP (which is free), and if they are still alive and kicking also things like Magma or Maxima. Varius different free mathematical softwares have been integrated in SageMath (free) using Python, so that should be checked too. Even without using SageMath, they tell me there are a lot of libraries (if that is the right word) for Python to perform various mathematical tasks and also for visualize things.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>First of all, next time ask on on /r/learnmath because this is not the right subreddit. Clearly computing this with a calculator takes a fraction of a second. But if you want to do it with a pocket calculator: The sum of all the powers of two from 1 to 2^k is equal to 2^(k+1) - 1. For example 1+2+4 = 7 = 2^3 - 1. Or 1+2+4+8 = 15 = 2^4 - 1 So your sum is just equal to 2^9901 - 1 - 2^1 - 1 = 2^9901 -4.(because with respect to the full sum it lacks the terms 1 and 2). If you are interested in just 6 significative digits (I assume I don't know what "standard form" means), then we can just forget about that -4. Computing 2^9901 is easy with logarithms. Log10(2^9901 ) = Log10(2) * 9901. = 2980.49798706907781381122879666... so we know that the resulting number has 2981 digits. And the first digits are 10^0.4979870690... (i.e. I took the fractional part) = 3.14765459271 so 2^9901 is approximately equal to 3.14765459271 * 10^2980 .</TEXT>
