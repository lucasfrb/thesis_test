    <TITLE>Some level of empathy is lost to me now</TITLE>
    <DATE>2018-04-13 02:54:17</DATE>
    <TEXT>I've always had an extremely deep sense of empathy. I know this because I've always been exceptionally sensitive to the thoughts and feelings of others, even when generally left unspoken. It's a bit like a gift and a curse though, especially when I can sense the worst. I recently realized I had lost some of my most basic empathy when it came to national tragedies. I have read and heard about so many tragic events with people's lives lost that I can no longer feel much of anything despite the number of people affected or the grave nature of the tragedy. As you might imagine, this actually makes me feel almost like I've lost a sense of my humanity because these things no longer evoke a response from me. What do you think?</TEXT>

    <TITLE>Passive aggressive "sort of" friends are the worst.</TITLE>
    <DATE>2018-05-01 22:47:07</DATE>
    <TEXT>I've recently had kind of a problem with someone I would call a friend. Though lately I question more and more if we're actually friends considering that half of the time they seem too busy to talk to me, and how they've recently started posting more vagueposts on social media that really feel like passive aggressive jabs at me. I've already got a lot on my plate with my life and I'd really rather not have to deal with more drama if I can help it. I've had rough friendships before that I knew were rough friendships because I was always the person who was more or less taken advantage of for being "the nice one who everyone depends on." That is literally my own fault for being so giving and taking so long to realize how unhealthy I've been, and I've since learned my lesson. This is different though. This person and I have this weird interactive pattern where we'll have nice conversations for a little while, then we'll not talk for long periods of time, and then we'll be back to talking like nothing happened. Am I ridiculous for still being friends with this person?</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Not sure what brought this on, but I'm dying to get some feedback and see if anyone else has experienced something similar.

I was attacked by raiders, killed most of them, but ended up getting stuck at 80% with no more new enemies spawning. The file has had this problem for a long time.</TEXT>

    <DATE>2018-06-06 15:46:13</DATE>
    <TEXT>I've only recently broken through to the 60\+ levels of the game and I'm really starting to see more "super" enemies start to spawn in, including Charred Ghouls and the like. It's been really interesting, I really didn't expected "charred, bloated" ghouls on the upper limit of what kind of enemies would show up in the game. I even had my fortified settlement at Finch Farm absolutely overrun with extremely high HP charred ghouls just tearing everything to pieces. **How much crazier do the enemies get than this as you level up, or do they top off at things like "charred ghoul", "glowing mutant hound", etc. ?** Tagging this with a spoiler in case people don't want to be spoiled to some of the highest ranking enemies in the game.</TEXT>

    <TITLE>Salem and Barney Rook: What A Lonely Place</TITLE>
    <DATE>2018-06-06 20:53:36</DATE>
    <TEXT>Honestly not much of a shipper myself, but I started to realize something after playing Fallout 4 again recently. You know Barney Rook, the Mirelurk hunter from Salem? He would be a perfect match for Ronnie Shaw. Ronnie couldn't possibly be much younger than Barney, despite not having gray hair. They're both also dedicated soldiers, and it's only a shame that Barney can't be persuaded to join the Minutemen. On a more serious and less shippy note, I'm still agitated that you can't build anything in Salem. I think even just being able to build something small in the town center would be good, at the very least one more location that could be easily secured in the top\-right corner of the map. Maybe it's asking too much, considering the lighthouse. I would say link me to some mods if they allow building settlements in Salem, but I'm sort of playing the Xbone version of the game and I have no idea how the mod system works for that.</TEXT>

    <DATE>2018-06-29 18:01:06</DATE>
    <TEXT>The politics, the suffering, the personal loss, the meager living, and everything in my house is breaking down. Even the walls. This last decade at length has been fucking rough. **My mother died around 6 years ago, in September.** My father has never been part of the picture, the bastard hasn't even tried to find me or my mother since he left. I have been raising my brother (who was 12 at the time) up to the age of 18. Inheritance gave us enough fortune to live on our own for a while and I actually (foolishly) ended up donating a lot of the money to charity. I have always been.. too generous for my own good, and I've since learned to buckle down a bit harder on every single dollar I spend. I've had trouble securing any real work. I've had a couple of good retail jobs (good being relative, maybe "manageable" is the better word there) but it's been hard making enough to offset how much needs to be spent. I live in an extremely poor rural area that is lucky to even have internet access. As you all might have read in the news lately, places like this might be some of the first to be cut off from internet access any day now. I wait for that day every single day, so I have one more reason to want to actually do it. Because for the most part, I really don't care that much for the people who live here. They are all vastly different from myself. The last nail in the coffin has to be the awful house I live in, though. Because I've been deeply depressed, it's been more difficult to do anything necessary around here. I've wanted to work on this house for ages, but a lack of money and motivation has ultimately ruined every single attempt. I wouldn't give this house another decade to be left standing, it was pretty much blowing in the wind during the last major windstorm. The whole house shook, and it frightened my family. The reason I put the politics as a potential reason should be obvious. I have never seen such a complete disregard for human life and suffering than I have in the past couple of years. I have never seen my country turn on itself, divide itself like it has recently. As someone who has already been suffering for close to a decade reading the horrible headlines about people being shot to death on a regular basis, or how often people are overlooked or mistreated because they disapprove of the way things are being run... Jesus Christ. Why? I know that was a lot, I don't really care. I had to get this off my chest somehow. I don't know how I'm still here. I don't know how long I'll still be here.</TEXT>

    <TITLE>Please wish me luck, working on something of a platformer/shooter</TITLE>
    <DATE>2018-09-22 01:14:59</DATE>
    <TEXT>I've been inspired by other platformers and popular indie games, including some personal favorites that are out on the Nintendo Switch. As such, several days I couldn't help myself and immediately got to work on this game, concepts, art, mechanics, and so forth. Unfortunately, it will be an extremely slow project at the start because I'm a one man team working on this. This game will most likely be a wildcard dystopia-based shooter from a third person perspective where you control one of a limited set of characters, possibly with their own backstory mode. A major premise I will be working on with this game is a sort of "free for all" limited arena mode where up to 4 players over a LAN or Internet connection will be able to fight it out. Sort of like those old Worms games. Assuming this project goes smoothly and I have it ready in the next few months to a year or so, I'll probably put up for sale on Steam (provided that's even still possible, you never know with Steam.) I may eventually have to go around finding proper artists to help me out with this, but I'm dead set on doing all the programming myself. If this project really comes into shape, I might even launch a Kickstarter. **Don't worry, I will NOT be doing anything like that until I'm fairly sure I can back it up with actual rewards for supporting it. I am painfully aware of all those forbidden** ***failed Kickstarters*** **that ended up being deeply disappointing to their players/customers...** I'll be providing a demo or a video whenever this project gets to a point where I feel like it's actually worth showing off to people. For those of you that have never custom designed movement sets, you have no idea how long it takes to adjust variables like that. But god, is it rewarding! I'm getting a bit ahead of myself announcing all of this, but I will be glad to keep people updated if they're interested. Good luck out there to the rest of you working on your own games, too!</TEXT>

Storms and other major natural disasters are more likely to happen as the Earth's natural climate intensifies and alters the jet streams. The ultra rich are already asking where they should set up their doomsday bunkers, to which the scientists are telling them "good luck buddy." Do you think we're in the final days of humanity?

    <DATE>2018-09-27 21:13:18</DATE>
    <TEXT>Hey guys, sorry to bother you once more. I'm having trouble with my event editor in that a couple of weird things have been happening. One is that I've tried to reduce the clutter my game creates by placing less items outside the frame and more on a "creation" style event that creates the intended item when the command is executed. That was working really well, but eventually items have been disappearing from the frame entirely and I've had to copy and re-code them from other frames suddenly. Has anyone else experienced this? Also, having a bit of a time with some objects staying invisible. I have a number of objects assigned to the "invisible group" that are fine and happy to remain invisible like everything else in the group, but then some objects freak out and stay visible no matter what. I've coded with "Always" and other absolute determining factors and yet even hard-coding these objects to stay invisible doesn't work. It's really weird. I might re-create these if it gets much worse. I also wanted to state that after I give the graphics a lot of polish and fix these existing problems, I'd love to share a short demo reel of some intended features in the game I'm creating within about a week or two! I'm hoping less, but I would rather give myself a lot more time than not enough time. Any help you all can provide would be appreciated, in the meantime I'll look over the event list carefully and make sure I'm not missing anything bizarre.</TEXT>

    <TITLE>Is Putin a political genius?</TITLE>
    <DATE>2018-10-05 15:39:19</DATE>
    <TEXT>He has most of the world fighting with itself and it's own people, but especially for political reasons. America is one of the most vulnerable places with this happening, Putin taking a considerable interest in using American politicians to put forward his interests by creating internal political conflicts that only get worse every day. He's stoking the fires with his brigade of paid Russian trolls and misinformation spies, and now the attacks have ramped up more than twice what they already were. It's gotten so bad that if you took two seconds to look at most commenter's profiles, you would notice they were all blank and recently created. America is still under attack. He kills or jails his most powerful critics and has thus far suffered little consequence for it. There's a guy still in jail who was released just long enough for Putin to put him back in jail soon after. Those who criticize Putin don't get to live long and healthy lives, and he knows it. He's still believed to hold the fate of the President of the United States in his hands. He's probably getting a spectacular show out of watching the United States eat itself alive.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I just played a custom made scenario with a simple rule that proved to be extremely interesting. Default "Crashlanded" starter, but with an incident that makes 1 Wanderer join your colony each day. As you can probably imagine, it started off as extremely beneficial. A new colonist every single day? Hot diggity. The real fun came after hitting about 10 pawns or so. Especially the ones with uniquely violent and unstable traits. Needless to say I got curious and had a group of 20 something pawns open up an Ancient Danger building; it didn't go well. I recorded bits and pieces of what happened, I might upload a video of the experience later.</TEXT>

    <DATE>2018-10-22 23:45:29</DATE>
    <TEXT>I'm a little rusty at this, I don't write that much. Shots rung out from the brush of the jungle trees, just as the colonists moved to the sandbags to quickly secure the sandbags and prepare for the raiders' assault. Sarai hardly had a moment to collect her breath or her thoughts before a bullet flung past her face with a near miss. "How many?!" she shouted in a harsh and commanding tone, brimming with obvious fear. As Sarai spoke, several more rounds pierced the sides of the sandbags. Ray took a moment to size up the damage from a few feet away, softly hissing. "Two too many. Probably men, by the sound of their voices." Hardy scowled at the prospect of men attacking the settlement, the tone in her voice conveying her disgust beyond the already repulsive reputation of raiders. Hardy wasn't thrilled about being forced into the defensive line with the others, but two colonists had already been injured by a recent attack were still badly injured from the fight. Despite her lack of experience, she sucked in a breath and fired a few shots from her pistol. Ray and Nevil briefly glanced at each other. Nevil was extremely nervous, and Ray looked deeply displeased. Nevil didn't bother much more of a thought towards the psychopathic Ray, who looked just as likely to want to kill Nevil as he did the raiders themselves. Ray cocked his revolver and took a skillful shot at one of the raiders, managed to crack a piece of their body armor. What neither of them expected was the sudden plume of smoke that appeared and obscured their vision of the attacker just before bullets whizzed out from the cloud and into the torso of Nevil. Upon being hit, Nevil choked out a cry of anguish as his lungs filled with blood. He had taken a direct hit from the raiders' bullets, and the bullets had pierced his heart and lungs. Sarai had not realized what happened in the short time that her well aimed shot managed to pluck off part of a raider's arm in the process. The group heard the remaining unharmed raider swear loudly as his friend was forced down by the pain, in no hesitation to continue fighting as his friend lay dying on the ground from his wounds. In a moment of confused torment, Hardy paused. She considered the fact that a man she had hated so much was now dead on the ground, but felt the juxtaposition of loss because it was a member of her own group. She stared at Nevil's bloodied torso in mild disbelief, then looking on to the others as they hurried to the now dead Nevil. His expression was one of horror and sudden shock, his face still partially twisted in pain as a stream of blood flowed across the ground. "This can't be real. He's been with us so long. He can't.." Sarai held the lifeless body to herself as she found her grief had overwhelmed her, hardly considering her own safety as the raiders now seemed to be gone. Ray shook his head disdainfully and went on about his business with relatively few wounds of his own. "Better him than me" could be heard in a whisper almost as light as a breath, gently tipping his cowboy hat forward with little remorse in his trail back to his quarters. Hardy had stood there for a long time before realizing the danger had passed. It wasn't until she had spotted the others starting to move Nevil's body that her mind cleared of whatever thoughts had occupied her, trying to mask some hidden relief that he had died. Unlike her son Ray, any measure of death in the colony hit her with at least the barest amount of grief, and it looked like this time would be no different. If anything, she was disappointed she hadn't had a chance to kill Nevil herself.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I'm angry at hypocrites for saying they won't excuse a certain behavior and then exhibiting it themselves. It is a wonderful thing to have convictions that you will stand by and follow in most if not all cases. What I cannot forgive, what I will NOT forgive is always doing the opposite of what you tell people to do. The belief that "science is bad" when a modern society depends on science for all things to survive. The oath to support the rich by all means while the poor and needy are left to suffer and starve. This is something the Religious Right should be condemning outright. Where is the party that supported Family Values? Where did they go? It's why when I'm wrong, I accept my mistake and concede to those who point it out. It's why when I see people suffer, I will at least pause for a moment and try to give some consolation to the person affected. It's why I try so hard not to wish bad things on people I don't agree with or even see as "evil". I don't hate Republicans, really. I hate hypocrites. Some of my best friends in life have been staunch Republicans.</TEXT>

    <TITLE>Should wheat be an available crop?</TITLE>
    <DATE>2018-11-10 22:20:29</DATE>
    <TEXT>I've always thought it was odd that you can grow things like hay and cotton but not wheat, one of humanity's longest existing staples for food. Wheat would probably be one of the few foods that require very specific cooking parameters like "must cook in an oven or stove" because wheat is particularly difficult to cook over a regular fire. Wheat grass probably wouldn't make a great cooking ingredient with other foods, but baked bread would probably be helpful in creating "fine" and "lavish" meals. Bread also keeps generally well as long as it's kept away from moisture, but your guess is as good as mine how long it should last in-game. It would also open up an option to create "sandwiches" in which butchered meat could be combined with bread in a way that overrides the "ate raw meat" modifier. If there is a mod that puts wheat in the game, I haven't actually tried installing it. I don't use many mods on Rimworld at any given time because sometimes I'm forced to be offline and it breaks functional mods when I'm not connected to the internet. Anyway, tell me what you guys think.</TEXT>

I've basically managed to get an almost autonomous colony out on the ice sheets on the northern part of my world. It's been an extremely difficult and testing experience, but some lucky pod drops and random raids have been beneficial to me. That is to say, I encourage the raids because they provide my favorite source of unintentional food product. So yeah I've still got all three colonists alive but just barely, probably soon to be wearing items of human leather while prepping the much needed hydroponics wing I'm trying to get going. So yeah!

I mean to say that if you have $20 and you spend most of it and store away the change somewhere in your house, you can inevitably come back to it later. The dollars and change I've saved with this method has been so consistently reliable that unless I know I have an immediate payment that won't allow me to save the remainder, I always store it away somewhere. Maybe it's a pretty standard way of saving money, but I like to compare it to the "Great Depression" way of keeping money if you know you have enough in your bank to hold you steady for a short while. If you haven't already tried this, I highly recommend it. It's literally saved my life on a couple of occasions.</TEXT>

Apparently in New Guinea there had been a major tsunami in at least the last day since the dream happened (within 12 hours), making me rule out precognition- but I thought it was wild that I was able to sense the tsunami at all. I had similar bad feelings when my body and senses went crazy during Haiti's earthquake several years ago, but they felt a lot weaker and more vague at best.

    <DATE>2019-02-20 17:51:19</DATE>
    <TEXT>I can't do it yet, as I don't have my full plan mapped out at the moment. I've been tossing around an idea for more than a year now to get a game crowdfunded, but I can't present much more than that until I have the means to make it a reality. I've been working on weak Clickteam-based prototypes.. that I'm probably never going to finish. I'd much rather make the project in Unity with a small team of developers. Problem is, we're talking majorly outsourced work because I live in the actual middle of nowhere. The main resources I have are a strong computer background, several years of FL Studio experience, self-taught C++ knowledge (which is still incomplete,) and currently no knowledge of C#. My core strength is creativity. I am a writer and a musician at heart. I would happily provide the lead plotline for a game with the aid of some skilled artists, programmers, and other writers. I have been actively compiling ideas for a solid plotline for well over a year now, and I predict I could get the rest of the whole thing figured out in the next two months. I cannot make visual art to save my life, therein I really doubt I could strong arm a game into existence like some of these more talented solo developers are doing. Plus, I'm skeptical! I keep reading about all these scams by people who say they're going to crowdfund a game and end up breaking a lot of gamers hearts. I don't want to end up like that, I actually want to deliver on what the people are expecting of an end-game product. No early access, maybe just peeks at development over time. So to those of you that have knowledge of how crowdfunding actually works... when is the time to do it? Where are the resources spent? What are the priorities in getting something like this off the ground? Am I a little too ambitious?</TEXT>

    <TITLE>What do I need to to do to become an independent contractor?</TITLE>
    <DATE>2019-03-03 19:21:21</DATE>
    <TEXT>Hey Reddit, a bit lost here. I'm a U.S. citizen, have been all my life. I was told by a bot to put this here. I want to become an independent contractor, but I have no idea what the full legal requirements are. From what I understand there are some extra tax rules and exemptions, as well as the need to officially register as a business owner. I have the business license cost and forms for my local county, but I'm in a weird financial situation. You see I've been low on money for a while now. So much so that I owe a fair amount in county taxes, despite not owing anything on any other taxes. (Trust me I did my research, nothing to federal or state. Just county.) It's been extremely difficult trying to pay them back, but I wasn't sure if this whole process would affect my ability to register as a contractor. Before I get the obvious questions, it's been a while since I worked officially. I was living off of an old cashed-out stock account for a while- this was before the county notified me that I was behind on my taxes. Yes, I paid what I could. They have given me little to almost no notice on this, for the most part. Then I had to sell my car, to help pay for my family's food, water, and electricity. It wasn't quite enough money to pay back the taxes but it was enough to keep the power on for a while. The more I write about this situation the more dire it seems, and it probably is. Will taxes keep me from registering as a contractor and attempting to pay them back with the money I earn? Am I in some messed up legal jeopardy?</TEXT>

    <TITLE>Almost out of money</TITLE>
    <DATE>2019-03-14 21:26:26</DATE>
    <TEXT>I'd love to know what people have done to come back from being nearly 100% broke. My family has been extremely careful about money thus far and it has kept us from going under completely, but we're just nearly out of options. I'm going to end up spending just over $300 on our power bill, and that's probably it. Barely enough for food or water, really endgame scenario where we could very realistically starve to death. I'm extremely skeptical of getting on welfare. Government has shown they are delighted to cut off the remaining food programs that are in place, in favor of turning the money over to something "more lucrative" for the country. Whatever the hell that means. I don't like the idea of depending on someone else's money, but I do cherish advice and a way out in a desperate situation. So if anyone has a really good suggestion for getting out of this god awful situation, I can't think of a better time to ask.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Anyway I felt the need to clarify for anyone who's watching my page for whatever reason, or seeking out my posts. I do work. Sort of. It's not a formal job, but I make a bare minimum of trying to survive off of eBay. I don't make nearly enough to survive off of what I make. It's a very touch and go operation where eBay's fees are often as costly as the bills I have to try and pay with the money I make. The only upside to all of this is that apparently I am "above standard" in terms of selling things. This is because I highly value people who buy from me and attempt to give them excellent service. I try to understand them from the same position I would be in as a buyer on eBay, because I am also that. I felt the need to clarify on this for people who think I am never trying to make money or make a living for myself. I am. I am constantly seeking new ways to make money, I have been heavily researching ways to do so for weeks upon months. I don't just do eBay, I am also an amateur musician and a writer. I am currently working on getting a book finalized for Amazon that I will hopefully have in paperback form within the next week. Living on a bare minimum can really push someone to their breaking point. My heart goes out to those of you that know where I'm coming from.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I just think it's really interesting how the Ruin was apparently hiding in wait in the core of Earth for almost that entire time, and it wasn't revealed until the Protectorate graduation. At this point in time humanity had already developed high end casual FTL, seismic detection equipment (usually seen on the first planet you arrive at if you go cave-searching), laser/plasma/etc. weapons, extremely efficient matter manipulators, at least hundreds (if not thousands) of other Protectorate graduates before your character, and other advancements on Earth we could scarcely begin to imagine. I'm just saying; unless the Ruin suddenly teleported itself into the core of the Earth it seems extremely unlikely it would just "appear" at that exact moment and tear the planet to shreds..</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Today's the day where I just shut down. Empty all around. No motivation. Finally really just feel like I'm going through the motions, like nothing will ever matter again. My emotions just shut down so suddenly. I feel like I should be freaked out, but I'm completely calm. I can't feel anything. Maybe physical pain, but I'm not in a hurry to find out. It's not bliss but it's something like it, just letting me be completely free for a little while and not feeling anything. Is this what mind-numbing depression is like? It might be kind of nice if I didn't already know it felt wrong. Like something's gone, like part of my soul is missing. Anyone else?</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I can't tell what I'm feeling anymore. I can tell I'm really close to the end of *something* because my emotions stopped functioning normally. I'm sure at least a few of you know what I mean. Tired, angry, drained, confused, and maybe strangely happy (as a sense of an "end" approaches). I think maybe it's weird that I'm starting to get this odd "bliss" feeling from knowing that I might not even have much longer, that maybe this can finally come to a close. I'm selling the last of what I own or eBay, or at least I'm trying. Everything I can afford to part with that I still don't need to use in my daily life. I'm broke. Beyond broke, really, using borrowed time on this overpriced internet connection for one last desperate attempt to not die. I've got less than 20 dollars to my name, and I'm waiting feverishly on a promise for money from the government that might not even come through. I don't consider this "suicide watch" materials because I'm not trying to die. I'm trying to survive. I'm in the last throes of trying to really live and the desperate struggle that comes before all hope is lost. I am not going to hurt myself, nor am I going to try, but I'm going to claw at my last options. Jobs? I've gotten offers, from places that I can no longer reach because I no longer have a functional car. There is no way for me to take the jobs I have been offered, and I know no one who could help me. You have no idea how empty and unhelpful transportation services are in my local area. It's cruel. It's cruel to have opportunities I can't reach. If this is one of my last posts on Reddit, it was nice knowing you guys.</TEXT>

    <TITLE>2019 Analyzed by a Musical Amateur</TITLE>
    <DATE>2019-04-21 22:57:14</DATE>
    <TEXT>Brushing up on my own musical and analysis skills here. I decided to sort of "pick apart" 2019 to figure out what it is that makes it so great to listen to. There's so much going on here. Song nuances, effects, and mastering are sometimes really hard to detect.  #8203; \- It should go without saying but I will say it anyway; the song is very high production value. It only makes sense considering it's played by Solstate. \- The intro with Charlie opening the grate/door is a nice little touch. It definitely adds to that vaguely "indie" vibe. \- The guitar at the beginning is set up in a way to disarm the listener for at least the first several seconds, just about to the 30 second mark. \- The fake-playing of the instruments is undoubtedly brilliant, but that's more to the video than the details of the song. Still love it though. \- Charlie's voice is a little off-key in some small parts but it's not enough to throw off the song, much respect for that. \- There's a pretty intense snare rollout that drives the transition into the drums, and they keep things rolling until the interlude. \- There are little touches that are taken for granted that add just a little touch of extra atmosphere to the song. The *warped and diluted sounding guitar frets* that will occasionally play just under the volume of the other instruments. \- When the bass goes nuts in the interlude, there are such intense frets playing just in the audible range that accompany the sound so beautifully. They "lighten" the sound as it were. \- The way the **"WATCH"** scream is distorted in such a classic screamo metal style is pure platinum. Better than gold. \- The background scream-singing of "2019" is so engaging to listen to. If you didn't expect it, it catches that much more of your attention. Even when you've heard it a few times before, you practically listen in anticipation of it. \- There's a sub melody in the main guitar melody. It's characterized by those "distorted" frets that I mentioned previously. It turns into a regular guitar from time to time, and adds to the depth of the song. \- You can just barely tell there's some harmonizing on Charlie's voice in different spots. I can't tell if it's a backup singer or not. Sorry! If anyone else has anything to point out or thinks I'm mistaken in my analysis, feel free to add a comment or to shake me down for doing something wrong.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I've wanted to die since around my late teenage years, maybe my 20s. Gives you a vague hint to my actual age. Yes, I realize I am either more or less mature than most people imagined. I'm coming up on my 31st birthday soon, and secretly I cannot wait to die. I just don't want to suffer. **I'm not going to suicide.** I'm going to wait it out, you know, the worst possible way. My family has no money so odds are I will actually starve to death. Just wish this didn't mean I was letting my cats down, but I have no clue what I'm supposed to do with them at this point. I don't qualify for unemployment, far as I know. There is one job I worked that might have covered me for unemployment if I could have spent just a few more years working there, but I was unfortunate enough to resign under very unsettling personal circumstances. A few deaths in the family. Multiple. And I lost a lot of my options right then and there. Hey, not everyone gets to choose their own death. I'm living mine out until I die before I even reach 40. My biggest regret is the debts I still owe people. Part of hating capitalism as a system, I guess. When I do die, I permit science to use my body to study the effects of whatever eventual cause of my death. I can see it as a benefit to the sciences in the future to know more about human anatomy this way. No one will call me back for a job. No one will care when I die. **Everything is as it should be.** I hope I was able to do at least some good, before I died. That's all I ever wanted.</TEXT>

    <DATE>2019-05-04 21:04:06</DATE>
    <TEXT>Everyone's eyes always seem to be on the President rather than on Congress. Sure, the president is the formal leader of the country. HOWEVER. Congress makes the laws, Congress decides if the president is allowed to stay in power, and Congress ultimately runs the show as long as there is no challenge from the Judicial branch. At a time when people seem more enthusiastic about the process of selecting a new president rather than addressing any problems with Congress passing unpopular laws that hardly benefit the common people, America risks slipping further down into a territory where the only real authority recognized in the land is in the hands of a central authority. What is your interpretation of Congress' role in relation to the Executive and Judicial branches of government? Do you feel that Congress is too dysfunctional or ineffectual to be considered a legitimate branch of government? Do you believe that people too often focus on the Executive (Presidential) branch?</TEXT>

No, the truth is, I had a lot to learn about coding in general. And about myself! So here I am much later with a better knowledge of C++ to at least marginally help with my usage of Fusion. It really has made a difference. I understand how the engine works a lot better than I did before studying programming; hopefully I make something that's worth sharing with the whole world! No promises until at least a few months have passed. I've got a lot of work to do. Edit: To clarify, I'm making a game.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>They want to investigate, but they dare not impeach? What the fuck, Democrats? At this point you're pissing ME off and I desperately want to see this through, as well. It's as if you don't care about actual results and more about gallivanting about "pretending" to be government effectual when you're in fact just pissing everyone off in the process; including the people who have been calling for an investigation into Trump since the beginning. Honestly the more I hear in the news about the investigations going on and Democrats jerking themselves off about what they've done while NOT impeaching Donald Trump does little more than piss people off. Either shit or get off the pot, because at this point you're diluting your own argument until not even other Democrats want to impeach. Is that the point? Just to piss people off until they stop paying attention to the Trump administration altogether?</TEXT>

    <TITLE>How Rare is Hyper Empathy for Men</TITLE>
    <DATE>2019-08-12 19:09:38</DATE>
    <TEXT>Pretty sure I have it. It drives me crazy, being able to sense people's emotions on a near constant basis. I can't "read an entire room" but when I focus on a particular person for at least a couple of seconds I can almost immediately get a read on their mood, no matter what they are doing. It bothers me. I've never been formally diagnosed and I'm not sure how you diagnose "hyper empathy" but I've always consistently had an unusually high empathy level according to general trial-and-error. But it's also made me extremely angry because it's like I can feel the suffering of others and righteous indignation that people feel, but cannot do anything to stop it. Is there a way to tone this down? Hell, I almost wish I could get rid of it.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>**People who use the "Default" Highlight Intro, what are your reasons for doing so?** Had to correct that. I'm mentioning this because I'm genuinely curious. I've seen a lot of players, even some that have had the game for years just always keep the standard "hero pose" Highlight screen for their POTG. I'm talking about the one where the hero just kind of stands on screen, not really doing anything in particular. There's nothing wrong with that! But I would like to know why people choose to do so, rather than use a flashy one. Thoughts?</TEXT>

    <DATE>2019-09-01 11:07:05</DATE>
    <TEXT>Logs are extremely good at bringing clarity to complicated issues. If there were conversational logs provided that showed what sort of terms that the temp developers agreed to when helping to work on Starbound, it could potentially 'clear the air' over a lot of this. Even if it wasn't the original posters who originally mentioned the issue at this point, it might be worth listening to others who raised similar 'flags' about it and claimed something disreputable was going on. Understandable if they don't have any logs, which is why I'm also willing to ask if other people who originally raised the issue have any concrete proof as to what happened. If they don't, the claim is relatively unsubstantiated and is doing more harm than good. No one wants unverified information as a "concrete case" of Chucklefish's wrongdoing. If we can't agree on that, I don't know what to tell you.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I couldn't think of a better title, because I feel like that speaks for itself. **Don't be deceived by her name.** Those of you who had the misfortune of playing Phoebe's games with a high difficulty curve know what I'm talking about. To give you a \*small\* idea of what kind of hell Phoebe's demented soul will put you through, let me talk to you about disease stacking. Three colonists had the plague, right? Then she decided three more colonists would get the plague. *One got sick twice.* Before all that happened, I had a psychic ship, an agitated army of angry cassowaries, and at least a couple of raids hit my colony previously. I even had at least one toxic fallout event. The psychic ship was easily the most dangerous thing that happened to my colony; I don't exactly have any advanced weapons yet and so the random Centipede that showed up nearly burned through half of my colonists at the time. I must be playing exceptionally well though, because I very rarely have deaths in my colony. I'm just running Vanilla RimWorld right now, I don't usually mess with mods too much because I used to have problems with them staying active without internet. And my internet goes down a fair bit. Does anyone else have any hellish stories about Phoebe? I really want to know.</TEXT>

    <TITLE>It's weird.</TITLE>
    <DATE>2019-09-18 13:51:12</DATE>
    <TEXT>I've always had really strong empathy. To the point where I suspect that if "supernatural" things really exist, I am most definitely able to feel or sense them in some manner. So much so that sometimes I can witness something paranormal and practically "feel" it out, whether or not I'm actually there. It's also extremely handy for being able to pick up on people's moods and opinions of things without them saying anything aloud, but that can also be a curse. **I swear to God that I'm not making this up.** This ability is very strange, and at times it's extremely uncomfortable. I mention this because after watching a video where I heard a muffled voice say "help them" in a supposed ghostly voice, I started tearing up for absolutely no reason. Like I could feel the woman's suffering, despite the fact that I had no attachment to the situation, the location, or the person in the video. I don't know what it means, if it means anything. It's possible I'm just losing it and cracking a little under my own stress, but I'm not sure. I felt a very genuine sorrow when my eyes started watering, and I rarely have something so odd like that happen just from a short audio clip.</TEXT>

    <DATE>2019-10-23 21:45:51</DATE>
    <TEXT>**Not actually meant as a serious theory, but a point of discussion to see what the community thinks of the idea.** We know all kinds of AI exist on Rimworlds, and even more mysteriously we have no idea how they got there or if they weren't just crafted by the humans who were already living there. The "Storytellers" are obviously *not real AI meant to be interpreted as literal Gods that craft events*, but as a game construct that help drive the narrative. We also know that AI in the game definitely do exist, mostly in the forms of cores, engines, and other major computerized parts that can be interacted with (to some degree) by Rimdwellers. But what if (Storytellers) WERE real, demented AI able to influence events around the Rim in real time? How many Randys, Phoebes, and Cassandras would there actually be? I don't recall coming across a formal explanation for where the "psychic" phenomena come from, only that the descriptions explain that they come from rogue AI. What if it came directly from a Storyteller? Just a fun little theory. Take it however you want.</TEXT>

    <TITLE>I keep finding out new things about this game all of the time. I wanted to share a few things that come to mind.</TITLE>
    <DATE>2019-11-10 04:22:03</DATE>
    <TEXT>(Some of this information may have been shared previously, or is documented in the wiki. This information is valid for the "Vanilla" unmodded RimWorld experience!) This is a lot of info, so please forgive the post length. Did you know: * Lightning strikes never seem to directly kill living things that are at full health? Instead they are more likely to "burn" a pawn or animal on a certain part of their body, requiring medical treatment. * (Previously shared) Thrumbos will eat trees? They are in fact animals that prefer eating large plantlife in particular, especially including trees. Remember this if you leave Thrumbos in an allowed area with vital tree patches! * The "X" and checkmark boxes can be dragged across a menu to change settings? By this, I mean that if you click and drag a checkmark across a pawn's "forbidden" menu status (jobs, etc.) you can unforbid them and allow large numbers of pawns to do those activities? And vice versa. * You can build multiple mortars to destroy a dangerous ship part? Just set all of your mortars to force-fire on the ship part, sit back, and be prepared to fight the mechanoids who might try to stop you! * (Previously shared) You can create a giant wall around most of your base, but leave a large and defended opening for raiders? Most raiders will not directly tunnel through your walls. They will often seek a more direct path to your inner base, which can be heavily guarded! * (Previously shared) Tynan is in the game? It's true! He's even specially labeled as a "game developer" as confirmation! * Multiple layers of a wall almost completely discourage raiders from tunneling your base? Unless raiders are using explosives, they much prefer going through thin layers of walls lacking serious reinforcement. More than two or so layers of 'strong' and fire-resistant wall will cause them to seek out a better vantage point! * Prisoners will steal weapons during a prison break? This can be extremely dangerous for your pawns. NEVER leave stockpiles or shelves with weapons near your prisons unless you are prepared for escaped prisoners to use your own arms against you! * EMPs will never "destroy" mechanoids, only stun them? In real life, EMPs have properties that can permanently shut down electronics for good. For balance purposes, this doesn't seem to be the case in RimWorld! * Orbital bombardments can completely decimate a settlement? If targeted at the nearest central point of a settlement by a careful pawn, the energy and damage from a single bombardment strike can often be enough to completely clear the area of enemies (or friendlies? If you're that kind of monster!) That's all I can think of at the moment. I would love people to share more information about the game that they feel new and even very experienced players could benefit from in this thread. Hope you learned something you didn't know before!</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Which is weird, because I've never been especially prone to that in the past. I don't know what's happening to my brain. I'm starting to see people I know I've never met starting to invade my dreams, and all of us have a very close knit relationship like we've known each other forever. The faces are all very clear to me; probably people I've met at work, but they're not my coworkers. I swear to you that it's so detailed that it feels like I'm just glimpsing into another reality rather than just dreaming about it, and it frightens me. By the time I wake up, I realize that I never wanted to leave. Maybe my imagination is getting out of control, too powerful for me to keep tethered to any sense of reality by the time I go to bed. This has happened several nights in a row in just the last couple of weeks, and I don't understand this "uptick" in spontaneous dreams where I'm living the life (I assume) that I always wanted.</TEXT>

    <DATE>2019-12-23 21:48:16</DATE>
    <TEXT>I've always had some form of depression, but it's always worst in the fall and winter. I get so completely lethargic. I don't want to do anything or see anyone. I hardly get much enjoyment out of the things I love, and the things that I have trained myself to do (for my own sanity and health) get much harder to do. Is it the cold? Is it the bleak sky? Is it just everything all at once? It doesn't make matters better that I've been missing my dead mother around this time of year; a time of year where the family often used to get together and take a trip to visit other family members. Those days are long gone, even though I was still relatively young when she died. I really don't know what input I expected but I did just want to put those post out there and just document my thoughts, maybe just try to find some light in what feels like encroaching darkness.

    <TITLE>Self important bullshit</TITLE>
    <DATE>2020-02-13 08:24:23</DATE>
    <TEXT>I'm going to be honest here. Feels like we tend to venerate intelligence as this abstract thing that people want to have, but must be born with. In some respect that's true, *but what the fuck does it matter?* Why do people pretend to venerate intelligence when I have met so many intelligent people who are lonely, miserable, and underappreciated? Why have I seen it so much? I really don't know if I'm considered an intelligent person because I'm such a massive fuckup and I had absolutely no interest in the shitty marathon that was "public education." But I've met smart people. Wonderful, obviously brilliant people that doubted their own worth. I don't want anyone to bullshit me about how they like smart people. Smart people are some of the most miserable people on the planet, especially if no one listens to them. Especially if those smart people came from broken homes and never really felt like part of anything. I know for a fact that my own mother was of an above average intelligence, but she was deeply lonely and felt outcast. I've had wonderful friends who were brilliant creative geniuses who felt shunned by groups because their ideas were "too far out there." It seems like we only celebrate genius if there's a way to market it, and that's a sin. Intelligence has never been more hated than in an era where people dismiss scientific fact as inferior compared to their "alternative." Mercy on your soul if you believe the Earth is a globe. God help you if you want to actually vaccinate your children. Bless your heart if your dream in life is to educate people. I hope the really intelligent people out there find things in life that make them genuinely happy. This ain't it, chief.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I'm getting extremely uneasy. It's been a while since I have felt genuinely suicidal, but everything to do with this Coronavirus and the lack of a response to it is scaring me to death. My stress levels are through the roof. For the last week, I have woken up wondering "is this going to be the day I get sick? Is this going to be the day I get laid off, because my boss can't afford to pay the workers with the slowing business?" Not only that, but my family. I only live with my brother, but we both basically depend on each other to survive. We help each other around the house, we share our money to pay the bills, and we are just barely getting by. We can't afford a medical emergency. I also firmly believe that if either one of us gets sick, we won't have the option to "stay home" because the alternative is a serious hit to our income. I'll be honest. I'm already stressed beyond my normal limit, so I have a bad feeling that adding to that stress with the reality of actually getting sick means I would die regardless. Despite normally having one of the best immune systems in my entire family; that doesn't mean a damn thing if I'm too physically worn down to take care of myself. I am supposed to be the head of household, and I feel like I'm falling apart.</TEXT>

The virus has a relatively low infection rate, and yet it is very unlikely to plateau anytime soon because some people are still attempting to group up and act as if nothing bad as happening. Subsequently, quite a few of them end up becoming sick as well. It is appalling for a country that dares call itself "the best country on Earth" to fail so seriously in the one thing that marks the strength of a great country; the protection of it's populations. I haven't met a single person that is completely confident in the government's ability to handle this incredibly dangerous pandemic. Not even the Trump supporters. Our economy is doing equally terribly. It has been more than a decade since we have seen such severe blows to the Dow Jones and S amp;P indexes. We have rarely seen such shocking developments such as the fall of multiple stock's worth in less than a month, realistically falling as much as 10,000 points in only a few weeks. The Federal Reserve is also failing us, as easily proven by the QE methods being employed causing only more panic with investors believing the market is collapsing. We need real leadership. We need someone else, and more than likely, we need them before November. That's why I believe, especially in with regards to saving Donald Trump from possibly getting fatally sick, he should be forced out of his position of power long enough for someone else to take over and restore confidence to America.</TEXT>

    <TITLE>No one is following quarantine. At least not anymore.</TITLE>
    <DATE>2020-04-21 22:57:23</DATE>
    <TEXT>I'm not going to snitch on anyone in particular, but as a general statement from what I've seen. I work in an extremely high traffic area that was nearly dead when the quarantine was being actively observed. We obviously saw people here and there, mostly people traveling home or truckers, but nothing too interesting. It was boring, but almost kind of quaint in it's own way, left time for employees to get extra cleaning done. It's been like that for a good few weeks. But the last week or so has been INSANE. We're almost completely back to the same operational capacity and we're seeing a lot of people from other states passing through our area. Personally witnessed plates from the tri-state area and beyond; almost exactly like it used to be before. It's like the quarantine isn't even happening anymore. The police don't seem to mind or even enforce any type of quarantine. I feel like maybe they're also not trying all that hard to enforce the actual procedure and just letting things happen as they may. I also feel like that's a really bad attitude to take, because when this all started I used to still hear people coughing their lungs out during the earlier part of the infection. I understand that people want life to go back to normal as quickly as possible, that's a completely relevant feeling. It's just that this is happening so shockingly fast that I'm pretty sure we're going to see some **nasty whiplash** from the virus. Only about 50% of people coming into our store are wearing masks. Some of them outright say the usual "the virus isn't even REAL" stuff you might hear. Not gonna lie. Starting to wonder how much this is going to accelerate spread.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>QAnon is the ultimate logical fallacy. Somehow these people believe that the Deep State is out to get Trump, who himself technically \*COUNTS\* as the Deep State by virtue of BEING president, but no, apparently somehow it's some deeper "true government" bullshit. I don't understand how these people think at all. When a woman was asked about what QAnon really was, she gave this insane look to her camera and said something like "Q is YOU... and Q is ME..."

Naturally, Trump took offense to that because it insinuates he's done a bad job. Does anyone remember what happened when a reporter asked Trump what to say to people who are afraid of might be coming next? "That's a terrible question." or something to that effect, basically completely dismissed the guy and pretended like we were living in a utopia.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Tennek was an extremely interesting YouTuber and it deeply saddened me when his content stopped being uploaded. He was clearly wrestling with some very difficult issues in his life and he didn't know how to talk things out with his fans, so he overreacted. I mean, having your stuff re-uploaded is pretty common if you're a popular channel. A lot of different channels have different approaches to dealing with it. What's not common is reacting by suddenly turning all your content private and lambasting your fans over it; I think there was definitely some bad stuff going on that he couldn't talk to people about for whatever reason. I'm going to miss Tennek's stuff but it's pretty obvious he's mostly dropped out of the YouTube scene for good.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I mean, I hate that they're right, but it's like this. You have two neighbors. Mister Joe---He's creepy, sometimes a little too huggy, and you're sincerely worried that he has some skeletons in his closet. Actually, you're damn sure he does. He's got some serious brain problems and you know it, sometimes he's gotten easily confused and lost his sense of direction from time to time. A lot of people in your neighborhood seem to like him because he tries to present himself as this sincere everyman, but sometimes it's hard for you to trust him. Mister Donald--- He's also like this, but every Friday he goes out on his front lawn and screams about how the Mexicans and the Jews are ruining America to whomever is willing to listen. Probably the neighborhood kids. By the way, you always find yourself telling the kids to stay away from him. He spends his nights watching Fox and screaming at the TV so loud the neighbors can hear it. If you ever invite him to parties, you get mixed results. Sometimes he seems half asleep, other times he's charismatic and superficially charming, but he's also constantly ogling your wife. He has family that he doesn't talk about, and you don't ask. Sometimes you want to ask him why you see guys in suits show up at his house late at night. He always says he doesn't know what you're talking about, and that you should mind your own business. There's a chance you've seen them carry at least one body-shaped garbagebag out of his house, but when you call the police and ask them to investigate, he ALWAYS has some pull with the chief of police that allows him to get away scot free. There is no fucking upside to this election, but I'm starting to see why people are rallying around Biden.</TEXT>

I think maybe you should message the company directly and ask them if there's a reason why it's happening; there's only so much information we could give you without technical information on our side.

    <TEXT>I'm having one hell of a hard time right now. I'm considered an "essential worker", so I'm one of those people you'll hear about at businesses that is "fighting the good fight" by trying to provide goods and services during a time where a lot of businesses are shut down. Let me tell you, it sure as hell doesn't \*feel\* essential. Ironically, I guess my job could be one of the most important. I am the go-to for keeping the business clean. I am expected to do a reasonably good job of making sure things are wiped down, cleaned up, and otherwise virus-free so that people can safely enter the store, buy something, and leave. But realistically, it feels like a hopeless cause. People keep coming in without masks, some of them even coughing out into the open air and then lying about not having symptoms. It's scary. But that's not really the point of this post. I guess I'm trying to get the opinions of others that might be out there trying to do work as normal, but not really feeling it, maybe even feeling like everything they are doing at this point is more of a waste of valuable time than anything else. Nothing feels right about the situation, it feels like we're just pretending like things could realistically go back to normal extremely quickly but we all know it's not going to be that easy. Sorry. I just had to vent. Things feel like they're going upside-down crazy and on my days off I don't even get to relax; I get lost in my thoughts and extremely pissed off that I can't go anywhere, do anything, meet with people I care about, or anything like that. Trapped like a damn rat.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I promise you, things will not go back to exactly the way they were. In attempting to force a reopening, America in particular has opened up the flood gates to Hell. Thousands of people have likely exposed themselves to infection, and the virus is still mutating faster than ever. Chances are, a lot of those people who are exposed may even be at risk of death. We won't know for a few more days. There's a strong chance that when the Second Wave hits, it will change America forever. \*Something\* is going to collapse, whether it be the economy or the population in general. We will eventually learn that humanity was in the wrong, but only after immense personal sacrifices across millions of lives. You don't forget something that dire, no matter how far your head is stuck up your ass. Personal loss tends to drastically change your way of thinking. So while it's going to hurt a lot of people, I promise that something fundamental is likely to change. Edit: Changed second paragraph slightly.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I said very early in the pandemic that I thought this had signs of a virus that would be detrimental to the human race. I don't know why. I don't have a medical degree, and at the time even the medical experts weren't entirely sure how bad things would get. But somehow I just had this extremely strong notion that COVID-19 was going to cause damn near catastrophic harm to the human race. The reason I'm talking about the human race and not the United States is because we know how this happens. People from other countries clearly still visit and migrate to the United States, even under these terrible conditions. Some of them will get sick. That's when the worldwide Second Wave is going to hit, and it's going to cause extreme damage to a lot of communities. Knowing that this virus is not only able to infect children, but cause a potentially lethal inflammatory syndrome, only confirms what I have feared the most. This virus is becoming more lethal. Day by day, hour by hour. I'd really like the opinions of some virologists so I can get a clearer picture of how this virus is different from previous viruses that the United States has experienced before.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>It's a problem with pathfinding. As far as I understand, there are no literal physical barriers (i.e. a space that a unit physically cannot enter that isn't a solid object) to prevent units from sometimes venturing over areas that should be impassible. So you get weird results like units gliding/floating over cliffs and other bizarre areas that they shouldn't be able to reach. To be fair, even with modern programming you have to keep in mind that Warzone 2100 was created in a time where real-time strategy pathfinding was not at it's peak. Westwood, not Eidos, is rumored to be among some of the [first groups that started to figure out how to correct pathfinding](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-VAL7Epn3o) to prevent units from easily violating terrain rules.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Programming can be pretty difficult, but I'm genuinely flabbergasted as to what triggered this. One would assume this event could only happen if the player was in an environment where the event was intended to happen (i.e. Pierre's shop). But for some reason this event happened without the player being anywhere near the shop. This can only mean that the event is sometimes rigged to trigger automatically when certain other conditions are met, such as the passage of time. If that's the case, why? This is really weird even by programming standards. **Edit: Now I feel really silly. It was either multiplayer or a memory glitch.** **Thanks to people for pointing it out.**</TEXT>

If you have good neighbors that might actually help you through this terrible situation, you might not die. **There really have to be better options than this.** Just because I don't agree with the people who are insane enough to mass protest during a pandemic doesn't mean I don't understand where they're coming from. Life is fucking rough. If you live in a rural community it's even worse, because there are a lot less reliable systems in place. Trust me, I live in a rural community. Things are \*god awful\* out here. There aren't a lot of businesses to begin with, so when they started closing/shutting down it started hurting us a hell of a lot more. People lost a lot of access to reasonable food supplies, and now some stores are occasionally forced to close down for deep cleaning. Because there's ALWAYS somebody with the virus that ends up infecting a worker or manager by being careless, hurting the rest of us in the progress. And it's even worse for the retail workers that are already being pushed beyond the limits of what they should be expected to handle. This virus might just kill rural America. Which unfortunately is going to have a pretty stark effect on urban America too, because a lot of the food that is produced is out in the Midwestern rural farming belts out there. If it's bad where I live, there's a good chance it's even worse out there. They were already in terrible shape because of the complicated political situations that were killing their livelihoods and raising their suicide rates. It might outright destroy them. A lot of people still have that "what's in it for me" mentality that holds us back as a species. That's why I'm losing a lot of hope of this getting any better.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I mean, that would also be pretty weird. That would imply that Stardew Valley gives NPC the level of self-aware agency that it would normally give players. That would be mind-blowingly complex considering how many problems it would create and confuse the player with. I admire what ConcernedApe did with the A.I. in terms of making all the people feel really alive, give them their own personalities and habits. But it would be bizarre and almost outright counter intuitive to give A.I. their own event triggers. Weird things like this would be happening all the time.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I just want to say that I'm utterly blown away. I'm old enough to say I remember the days when the Nintendo Entertainment System and Sega Genesis were considered "state of the art" for videogame graphics. I don't think gamers or game developers could have predicted in their wildest imaginations that we would essentially be crafting really living, breathing worlds with engines so realistic that they could fool people who didn't know better. I remember being one of the few people who was genuinely awed as early as the XBox 360 when the level of graphics were so advanced that we could see visible human sweat on the faces of exhausted characters. We're far past that now. Sometimes it frightens me how much closer to reality we're getting with our display engine capabilities. I also remember thinking to myself "if an engine this complex has a major memory leak, do you think the GPU explodes or just immediately burns to a crisp?"</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Trump is the most dangerous politician in our lifetime. Not because he'll bring us into a war. Not just because he's done a bad job so far. But because he's dangerously ignorant. He's insane. He's done the exact opposite of the sorts of things that a leader should be doing during a major crisis. He doesn't know how to actually lead, so he tries to blame other people for his problems. Now in addition to Coronavirus deaths, he might just cause American people to attack each other over a "Hoax". Trump is America's Caligula. He is so very CLEARLY not fit for the position that he's been placed in, but no one wants to force him out of power because he's so influential. He is going absolutely scorched-Earth because there are many more Americans that hate him rather than would ever want to vote for him. I don't know if America will survive Trump. We will see in November.</TEXT>

We are going to lose at least 100k people that could have been protected or saved if we had just responded differently. If our leadership had actually taken the virus seriously from the very start. We are making terrible mistakes even now. If you want a metaphorical explanation of how bad things are about to get, imagine that there's a huge "gate" between us and the virus. We can't completely close the gate, but it's been narrow so far. But now a lot of people are trying to force the gate open. We do not have the means to protect ourselves when the virus hits it's Second Wave. The virus has already infected at least 0.5% of the entire United States population, and that's by an extremely conservative estimate. The reality is, it's probably infected more than that. AND IT'S STILL SPREADING</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Edit for Title: At least I believe that's what's causing this. Right? Hi. Live in Virginia, have all my life. Never experienced anything quite like this. For as long as I can remember, May was always the start of the weather starting to get luridly warm and Summer-like. But I can't stand this near constant mid-50s to 60s pattern that's been hanging around most of the state, and it's been lingering here ominously. I can't remember a single time I ever had to turn on a heater past around the 20th or so of May; usually that's when my family would start readying the air conditioners. But if this is really a weak "polar vortex" as some weather analysts have suggested, I can definitely feel it. My house has poor heating so the cold creeps in like a ghost. I wasn't that surprised to find that when I looked up the average for my area, the projected temperatures were supposed to be somewhere around the 70s. That confirmed how uncomfortable and unnatural it all felt. What's worse is that it's messed up my plans to do some minor gardening before we shift over to Summer completely. It doesn't feel like Spring or Summer at all, it feels like the middle of the Fall. Who else in the Northeast suffering this strange phenomenon?</TEXT>

You feel so uncontrollably happy that you could do just about anything. Then the low point hits, and you're back to feeling like garbage. Sometimes the whiplash can be so severe that you wonder if your euphoric high was ever real in the first place. I'm deeply sorry to hear you're in a dark place right now. Been there.

    <TEXT>Yeah I had a feeling something like that was happening. I live in an area that does not typically get wind. Or rather, strong winds in my area are considered very abnormal. I have lived here long enough to know there's something very strange about the way the weather patterns have been changing. 10 years ago, we barely had any wind at all unless there was a major storm. 2 years ago we started getting really intense house-shaking winds capable of doing minor damage. In the last year, we've had such exceptionally high winds that people are regularly suffering wind damage to their homes and having their stuff blown right out of their yard on a regular basis. It's very disturbing. But the wind alone isn't why I'm disturbed. It's the fact that everyone just passively comments on how strange it is, but pretends like it's normal. No part of this is normal.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>America has never been worse off than after it abandoned the idea of actually taxing the rich what they \*should\* be taxed. Then it turned into a damn mantra. You have people who don't even make 50,000 a year going around telling people "b-but we CAN'T tax the rich, they earned it!" It's brainwashing, folks. That's all it has ever been. We as a country were actually better off when we DID hold the rich accountable. The country has been getting collectively poorer, pooling the wealth almost exclusively at the top. Worse, the politicians keep getting paid off by the already outrageously rich. All this bullshit about "we have control over the fate of our country" is finally starting to break down from the bottom to the top. When the bottom drops out; when the poor can no longer sustain the upper classes, that's when the whole thing will come crashing down.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I have mixed feelings about this. On the one hand, you get what you vote for. On the other, no one deserves to get a virus so f\*cking awful that it feels like you're dying while being tortured to death. I wish we (the United States) could collectively agree that Trump should not be president. It should really be that simple, but somehow, it's still up for debate. Gee.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Hey. I don't disagree with your points. It's the greed and rot from these power-hungry schmucks that made it possible for things to get this bad in the first place. Bad leaders don't just "appear", there are steps that happen beforehand that lead to the situation where they can exercise power. It means that a lot of citizens were willing to believe they had total authority over them, and quite a few even welcome it. And you see it in the United States in particular. A really awful person gets a position of power? Instead of the citizenry almost unanimously rejecting him, you have this 1/3rd to 1/4th of the entire population that blindly crows support for him because he "tells it like it is." The sort of people who while aren't directly part of the problem, help prop the problem up by being ignorant of the problem in the first place. It's madness. Some of the things that come out of Trump's mouth barely qualify as words, but you bet your ass that his entire administration will double down on the half awake mumbling that he considers speech.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Is it safe to say the Trump administration is just pushing through all of it's favorite things while this is going on? For crying out loud, when this all started we immediately had McConnell pushing judges. While people were distracted with that, Trump and Barr started to dismantle what was left of the Mueller investigation. More interestingly, it just helped further prove that they clearly broke the law. No matter what happens after this is all over, those of us with good memories are not going to forget the deep seated corruption that this administration was capable of. It is absolutely boggy, even worse than the Swamp that Trump was trying to warn people about.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>We know what happened. Politicians were feeding off of their ignorance for years. They actively sought to limit education in schools, thus further contributing to right-wing influence. They put out massive propaganda campaigns telling people that any left wing policies, ESPECIALLY state-funded healthcare and raising the minimum wage, were bad. Then the already deluded right-wing started making up it's own fears. There's such an incestuous brew of nonsensical ideas in this crowd that they think vaccines contain microchips. When the end of days comes, it won't be some foreign enemy. It will be the people that were never properly educated to trust science and reason.</TEXT>

They have already shafted most people that already recognized that it's a problem, and have painted them as "enemies that cannot be trusted." So what you've got is a ticking time bomb just waiting to go off. What the bomb takes the form of, no one knows. They just know that it will be either: 1. Civil collapse. 2. Total full blown authoritarianism. 3. A war; possibly civil or possibly a world war with dissenting nations. 4. A mixture of the others.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I'm not sure why you're getting downvoted either, seems like a valid question to me. There are actually a number of different mental illnesses you can become diagnosed with when it comes to excessive trauma. Some of them aren't actually all that much talked about. Some personality disorders like sociopathy and psychopathy can be induced by severe trauma, believe it or not. Narcissism, phobias, and other traits can also be induced by trauma. Depression is possibly the most common mental illness associated with trauma.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Trump is the worst leader in history. I really, genuinely, can't possibly think of a worse leader than Trump. Yes, even Hitler. Or Stalin. Absolute monsters for sure, but monsters of a past that most of us never had to live through. Just because they were killing people outright, doesn't mean shit. If there were **attributed deaths** to the fault of Donald J. Trump due to political warfare, sickness, poverty, and international disaster, I promise you would easily see *numbers in the millions.* ASSUMING WE SURVIVE THIS PRESIDENCY, we're going to be reading about this nightmare years into the future where the historians have a composite picture of what was really going on. They will talk about the deep levels of corruption that were interwoven into the United States government by Trump's loyalists. They will talk about how people intentionally spread disease, ignorance, and disinformation on his behalf. America will never be the same because of Donald J. Trump. It pulled back a lot of layers of American bullshit that we used to believe without question. "We will be healthy, because we are Americans. We will always be the beacon that the world looks to, because we are America. We have a future, we have freedom, because this is America. We choose our leadership." It was all bullshit. When Trump is finally removed from office, it will be like removing a barb from Uncle Sam's foot. It will be exceptionally painful, and the scars will take years to heal.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>It already is here to stay. The problem is that it's hard to get rid of it. Why? Let me go into detail. You would basically have to convince corrupt politicians to put their morals first and BAN the ability for lobbyists to pay them millions of dollars to pass legislation that only helps corporations. Key point: you would have to convince the PEOPLE BEING PAID EXTRA MONEY that they should ban lobbying, which is paying them **extra money.** It's scummy. It shouldn't have started happening in the first place, but it's been in practice for a while now. Other countries call this "corruption" but America just calls it "Tuesday" The only good news about any of this is that Americans' eyes are being opened. Unfortunately, as their eyes were opening, there were politicians trying to rub salt in their eyes to force them back closed. That's why America is such a fucked up place to live. It's by the poor, for the rich, and Good Luck.</TEXT>

About Micheal Cohen's Involvement ------ "Isn't your b-- isn't his business as your attorney, mister President?" "I have many, many -- just so you understand, I have many attorneys, I have attorneys, you, uh, sadly, I have so many attorneys you wouldn't even believe it. But Micheal is somebody --" "How much of your legal work was handled by Micheal Cohen?" Well I guess a percentage of my overall legal work I guess a tiny, tiny, tiny little fraction. But, Micheal would represent me and represent me on some things; he represents me like with this crazy 'Stormy Daniels' deal, he represented me. And -- you know, from what I see, he did absolutely nothing wrong. There were no campaign funds going into this. Which would have been a problem." "Then why is he pleading the fifth [amendment]?" "Because he's got other things, he's got businesses. And, from what I understand, they're looking at his businesses. And I hope he's in great shape, but he's got businesses, and his lawyer's probably told him to do that. But I'm not involved! And I've been told I'm not involved." "Mr. President?" "And I've been TOLD I'm not involved." ---</TEXT>

We have a few small businesses around here just barely being kept aloft by extremely loyal consumers. It's definitely not going to be possible for "entertainment venues" though.

Too many people in one place, too much money to maintain without a constant stream of customers, and too easy to spread germs.

    <TEXT>Actually it goes back further than that. People have said that President Woodrow Wilson gave a stronger voice to Christian fundamentalists and extreme conservatives, eventually leading to a much more polarized right-wing. Wilson barely even won his presidency, too. The vote was too split. His election almost single-handedly changed how the Republican party would identify for the next several years.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>It's alright, I wasn't going to yell about someone genuinely not knowing about him. He was a kid. He was about 12 years old and he was shot to death because a police officer thought he had a real gun, when it was actually just a plastic mockup gun. You know, a toy. Worse, the caller that told the policeman to come investigate also said "it's probably just a toy" so he was basically murdered for absolutely no reason. Oh and the cop, Timothy Loehmann, walked away with no legal punishment. No indictment, nothing. So Tamir is dead and Timothy is probably still out there, still on the force, still very much capable of killing more people in the future.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I decided to donate to him, too. That's a big deal for me because honestly I was not at all interested in Joe Biden. Big time "Bernie or Bust" kind of guy; and I'm still extremely sore that he didn't even get a shot at the nomination. But there's something bigger than that. What made me ultimately decide to support Biden was.. well. Biden is at least trying to act like a leader. Biden is at least trying to do the bare minimum of what a healthy, functional, and even remotely reasonable human being would do. He's doing his best to prove his leadership ability and empathy, which is a big deal. I say this because I look at Trump and I see the exact opposite. I look at Trump and I see nothing. It's like peering into pure darkness. The man breaks the law constantly. Trump constantly makes everything about himself, and he's engorging himself on American taxpayer money. He is indirectly responsible for the deaths of at least several hundred thousands, possibly millions. And he will never show his humanity. He will never apologize, show any remorse, or any leadership of any kind. Ever. There are Bernie people out there that would tell you that "electing Biden is much of the same." In some ways, I won't lie, that is true. There's still a lot I wish Biden was doing differently. He is hardly much of a Progressive hero. But I know what the alternative is. Unrestrained, unregulated, fascism. I'm not being hyperbolic, either. [Did you know that Trump is currently having his internment camps gassed with a mysterious chemical?](https://www.insider.com/report-detention-centers-use-disinfectant-causing-bleeding-and-pain-2020-6) What about all the thousands of deaths that Trump has been completely silent about, regarding the virus? What about the MAGA-bomber, the violent Trump supporters, and the very real death caused by crypto-fascists across America? I'm really sorry about the intense wording, but I feel like it's important that we talk about these things as they are actually happening in our own backyard. 2020 will be a chapter for the history books, and hardly for good reasons. BIG NOTE: I am not trying to divide anyone, either. I'm trying to say that despite my strong stance against supporting Biden originally, I came around as I saw there was a much, much bigger threat to American citizens that could not be ignored.</TEXT>

We shouldn't look back to it with "glee" and an urge to return to the "good ol' days" but I swear to God it really does feel like there are some people out there that want to kill again for the sake of a Second Civil War.

    <TEXT>**It was always the rich.** I'm just sad that years of programming actually managed to make people believe it was anyone else. You know racism? I'm not even f\*cking kidding you, it was invented by the rich. Maybe not \*exclusively\* because it was always there in the back of people's minds, but the rich knew it was the perfect tool for turning light skinned people against darker skinned people. You know, as a distraction. Do you think it's a coincidence that wealthy American plantation owners had a lot to benefit from treating black people like all they would ever be is slaves? It's by design. Years of racism built up to convince people that ownership of black men and women is "normal". Because the slave trade was extremely valuable. The rich still use racism and division to get what they want from the average American. And they will keep f\*cking doing it until they are satisfied, which is never. Have you noticed that the people who are most trying to push against the narrative of "Black Lives Matter" and humanity being equal regardless of skin, they're usually pretty right wing? Capitalism and race division almost go hand in hand. President Lyndon B. Johnson once said, "If you can convince the lowest white man he's better than the best colored man, he won't notice you're picking his pocket. Hell, give him somebody to look down on, and he'll empty his pockets for you." The rich control pretty much every aspect of the average person's lives, if they so wish. There's a reason you almost never hear about rich criminals actually going to jail and serving length prison sentences. That's because as much as we just love to believe that "justice is blind" and "everyone is equal before the law", it's a load of bullshit. **White collar crime is rampant and difficult to punish.** I was actually shocked when they managed to get enough of a case against people to punish them for college scandals. I thought, like most rich people, they would walk. So yeah. Open your eyes and ears. I hate the term "woke" because it's overused. I much prefer the term "eyes opened" because it really is like seeing the world for what it really is for the first time. Research any part of what I said and try to disprove me, I will be gladly listen to what you have to say. There are years of research on this subject.</TEXT>

I work in the sort of business where we sell food and there is limited store space, so being able to spread out reasonably is incredibly important. But... people don't really listen.

    <TEXT>"Faster than expected" Can we just go ahead and say we fucked up the projections? Everything is happening much sooner because the analysts were being far too conservative in their estimates. I don't know what kind of models they were following, but they were clearly flawed. I absolutely refuse to believe every single climate scientist in the world got it wrong; I feel that it's a lot more likely they were paid to tell people "hopeful news" and that we would be around to imminent collapse a lot sooner than a century. We are seeing temperatures FAR ABOVE the necessary temperatures for ice and snow to melt and defrost what would normally be permafrost areas of Siberia and the poles. Note that the average temperature of a Siberian winter is still just around 63-65 degrees F. We have had reports that Siberia has occasionally heated up to as much as 90 degrees F; catastrophically hot for such a normally cold region.</TEXT>

    <TITLE>Odd flickering</TITLE>
    <DATE>2020-06-20 18:02:06</DATE>
    <TEXT>Hello all. After a long hiatus from game creation for personal health reasons, I'm finally getting back into game development. I've decided to try Multimedia Fusion 2 once more, and things are going much more smoothly for me than they did before. However, having a bit of a problem. I'm using a non-standard method for creating a debugger. You know how flags can be toggled on-off to change layers? Well I've been using Flag 1 instead of Flag 0 to toggle my debug display, and something really strange has been happening. The program just seems to flicker back and forth rapidly between the two different layers. I've checked the code: "Flag 1 is off, so it will show 'layer 1' and hide 'layer 3'" This meaning that the Debug Mode is off. "Flag 1 is on, so it will hide 'layer 1' and show 'layer 3'" This meaning that Debug mode is on. But instead of doing that, it just seems to insist on showing flickering between active and inactive when Flag 1 is on. When Flag 1 is off, it doesn't flicker and the program runs as normal. But when Flag 1 is active, it flickers extremely quickly! Any idea what's causing this? Update on the strange flickering: I removed the original code and added some completely different code that should not affect the layers at all. It caused the layers to flicker again, completely disabled my ability to interact with layers, but otherwise performed actions as normal. This is really weird.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Different story in Siberia. Last I heard, very cold climates usually cause people to grow an extra layer of fat for survival; this has at least been proven in places like Alaska, so I figure it's probably true in Siberia as well. If it is true, then it highly increases their chances of overheating to the above-average temperatures that they are already unused to experiencing.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I think I figured out what it is. Sometimes performing certain events while the layer visibility is toggled creates the weird flickering, which I'm guessing is the program getting "confused" and trying to execute the event multiple times. Thanks for the input! I think I can work through this.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>The easiest and most direct way would probably be to create an event that "shoots" a particle extremely quickly across the screen, but while invisible. The particle could represent a semi-realistic "line of sight" that determines whether or not an NPC(?) can see what's in front of them. Another way is to create a "cone" of vision for an NPC to use as their general reference for sight, hindered by things like objects in front of them etc. Line of sight can be pretty difficult if you don't know what you're doing. There used to be this great tutorial with the Games Factory that showed an example of how to get the effect, but I have no idea where it is now.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>What you need is probably deceleration. Basically you could code a car to "accelerate" by holding down a button (repeat while key is pressed) that incrementally increases a value per second. So say like, an alterable value like "accel" that increases by 1 or so every few seconds. For a more realistic acceleration effect, you would have accel only increase by really small numbers. So maybe something like "alterable value named 'accel' increases by \[insert a variable here\] every 1 second". So what you should end up with is an alterable value you want for the "max" speed. So you might literally name it "speed". You create an event where holding down a button will take the "speed" variable and add "accel" to it over time. Same works with deceleration, but obviously just a bit more quickly. Trying to simplify this as much as possible: Speed - The speed you want the object/car to move. Accel - The increment of speed you want the game to add until it reaches a top speed. Max Speed - The limit value that you want the car to reach. If you want it to stop speeding it up after a while, you absolutely need this, or your object will probably just fly off the screen completely. I hope this isn't too confusing. I would probably need to create a whole video to explain this in a meaningful way.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>All Lives Matter is such an empty phrase, as I'm sure you know. It's essentially the same as saying nothing, but really trying to hide the racist undertones of what the speaker is really trying to say. "All Lives Matter" is the closest equivalent to "I don't care" without being so direct with it. Because it's empty jargon. Because it forces a conversation over "yes, all lives DO matter at some capacity, but you're ignoring the problem." It becomes a roundabout. "All Lives Matter" really is the same as saying nothing, because it contributes nothing to the conversation. It's a way to hide human sin by pretending that the world treats everyone equally and that dark skinned people are complaining over nothing. It's naive and disingenuous at best, cold and indifferent at worst. But hopefully reader, you know the truth. Black Lives Matter.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>The most interesting thing about the dynamic of the world as we know it is that we're still giving power to people that don't deserve it. Realistically, if human beings stopped acknowledging the power of other human beings that hold what we consider "positions of power" then the chain of command would start to completely break down. But humans are conditioned to accept leadership, especially if it comes from some "official sounding" position of power. Civilization will likely not survive the coming decade, and it will at least be very interesting to witness what happens to the whole of humanity as the ball gets rolling. People who had power will start to be ignored. There will probably be a lot of violence. And I feel, the monsters as you said, will probably be the equivalent of free roaming terrorists who will take whatever they please because the systems that would have stopped them have ceased to exist.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Marking as potentially NSFW: Whether you believe it or not, science knows. Science knows that you bear the scars and pain of ancestors long passed, it's ingrained into your D.N.A. At one point it was considered a theory as part of a videogame we all know as **Assassin's Creed**, but it turns out there may be more powerful truth to this than we could have ever imagined. Because eggs and sperm that bore another human into this world are just new versions of so many eggs and sperm that came before them. I'm not referring to sex specifically; I am referring to the nature of how genes are passed down across generations of human beings. You are the result of untold numbers of generations of humans before you. The world's most microscopic scars still exist in your very genes. They are not literal scars, but they do embody the suffering of your lineage. And obviously, everything that they could have \*survived\* as the dead cannot breed. Genetics are a powerful bearing over the person you are, or have become. Or will become.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I've said this before, and I hope it holds up. Barr DOES NOT have the same influence and protection that Trump does. Trump is really good at protecting himself, but he's really terrible at legally defending other people in his inner circle from being arrested, impeached, or otherwise legally arrested. Just look at Roger Stone. For all of Trump's bluster and attempting to protect his buddy from the ramifications, he's still going to prison. If Barr is thrown into an impeachment scandal, it's going to tarnish his reputation. He will forever be remembered as "one of the only AG in history to be dealt serious impeachment charges; possibly treasonous or defiance of office charges." It will impact Trump, but it will impact Barr a hell of a lot more. In fact, Trump will ultimately be forced to choose between two things. "Barr didn't do anything wrong and I will force this narrative until you accept it" and "Barr is scum, I never knew what a bad guy he was, and [this has nothing to do with me](https://www.businessinsider.in/politics/world/news/trump-said-he-was-not-involved-in-us-attorney-geoffrey-bermans-ouster-minutes-after-ag-barr-told-berman-trump-fired-him/articleshow/76488410.cms)." Count on it. If Barr gets thrown into the impeachment loop, he will be at the mercy of Republicans that will be forced to side with whatever twisted perspective that Trump takes. And considering that Trump's popularity is at one of it's lowest points in his entire presidency, it doesn't bode well.</TEXT>

All the systems that were already breaking down will be thrust into overdrive. Food sources will start to become scarce to non-existent. People will succumb to heatwave conditions much sooner, because of the exacerbated temperatures. This is the part of the collapse that is much more certain than anything else we are facing. Political struggles may cause temporary, if not intense struggles between human ideological values, but climate change is easier to compare to the human race avoiding being run over by a giant boulder. And it's gaining. If we stopped almost all emissions right now, we might actually stand a chance. But as luck and history would prove, it's looking extremely grim. This might be the catalyst for what many consider a true "worst case scenario" that will result in cataclysmic damage, the stuff straight out of nightmares.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Here's the thing, he is objectively the worst. We have never had a president who so openly and repeatedly chose the things that HE wants over the things that Americans actually want. We have never had a president that loved and encouraged such division among the American people so much to the point where the country feels like it's cleaved down the middle. We never had a president that was practically giddy to say "oh, it's okay to die from a virus! It's not even real, folks." Nor have we had a president actively take measures against the programs and organizations that would have kept the virus in check and protected people from it. Donald Trump is so bad, that quite a few people think he's in his position of power as a favor to America's worst enemies. He has created so much damage, sewn so much chaos, and generated so much pain, that it will take decades if not centuries to heal from the wounds he has inflicted upon the United States. There will be no going back after all of this. We will try, and we will fail. Too much has changed, and a lot more change is on the way. America is fundamentally a different place than it was about a decade ago. It's up to the American people to decide if that change will be for the better, or the worse.</TEXT>

To swing a wooden door that hard, you would need a string that would be very visibly in frame and pulling the door with a lot of force. I mean that door is being \*slammed\* against the wall, and you can hear it in the audio. If you couldn't hear it, you could easily dismiss it as fake because it might not be swinging as hard as it looks. But no, that door is being shut with enough force to compare to someone with a strong arm just pushing it closed, over and over. That's really freaky.

    <TEXT>**Your description is WAY too specific.** **It immediately reminded me of a creature that one of my friends used to be obsessed with.** You're either a brilliant writer or I believe you had a personal encounter with one of the most terrifying mythological creatures in the known world. It's so terrifying, you're not allowed to mention it by name, because it's believed that specifically saying or writing the name of the creature will cause it to stalk you like prey. I'll dare to call it the "rhymes with [blintalker](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Skin-walker)". It's a humanoid figure that has ritualistically sacrificed it's humanity to become another creature entirely, capable of taking animal or animal-like forms. I don't recall it's exact association with nature, but it's such a dangerous and ancient beast that it was mentioned in Navajo legends. If I remember correctly, some Navajo are still terrified of these old legends. They are associated with death and bad omens, curses, and darkness. That's exactly why when you specifically mentioned that it was an animal form that smelled like "rot" that it was more than likely "one of them". If this is just a story you wrote up, it's utterly brilliant. My hat is off to you. *But if you are telling an honest-to-god true story* of a terrifying personal encounter, I'm afraid you may have had an encounter with a SW.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>We have two extremely important events that will directly affect the future of the United States, likely ensuring that American citizens will die. One. The man in charge of the postal service, Louis DeJoy, is rumored to be seriously altering the functionality and efficiency of the postal service. Most likely on Trump's orders. Rural America will never be the same. The USPS is now almost directly under Trump's control, meaning that voting by mail will become impossible. More importantly, they could violate a long-standing rule of tampering with the mail being a federal offense. Voting by mail is the least of my worries. Because I know what comes next. The USPS will be gutted and transformed into a privatized corporate entity. It will be directly owned by the government, but operated and controlled by Trump's people. There will be no more "free mail" access in terms of giving and receiving mail. Rural America, especially the deeply impoverished, will be mostly ignored in favor of preferential treatment of the extremely wealthy. Two. The weakening of the CDC. If possible, the complete dismantling of the CDC. Trump has already withdrawn us from the WHO, that was only the first step. The next step is far more nefarious. If Trump cannot directly control the data, he will try to expunge the data completely. Americans will be forced to guess in the dark as the hard numbers of the Coronavirus cases become unknown to them. Thousands, if not millions, will die. It's hard to tell if Trump will exercise some kind of authority to make reporting on the virus illegal, but that would be the logical next step. Like a crackdown on the scale of a dystopian novel straight out of hell, the news is on the chopping block. State news is coming, and arguably, it's already here. People need to understand that I'm not pulling this shit out of my ass. I've been watching every single move that Trump has been making, and many of them have been somewhat predictable. If there is a rule to break or a person to protect that is of interest to Trump, or that knows Trump's secrets, he will violate the law if he has to. He's an extremely predictable, extremely one sided figure- he only seems unpredictable if you don't understand the mind of a psychopath. Or rather the clinical definition, "an anti-social individual." The best part? Everyone's too chickenshit to confront Trump directly. Not his people, not revolutionaries, not nobody. I have no faith left in the people of America. They have accepted all that is happening as "the new normal", possibly patiently waiting for their likely death as the country comes to it's closing chapter. This is where America dies. So enjoy it while you fucking can.</TEXT>

Hell, I wouldn't be surprised if this lead to massive riots across the country; this time lead by disenfranchised citizens feeling like Third World refugees inside of their own country. Nothing pretty will come of this. Only pure ugliness. Most likely death.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Honestly that's not the half of it. For those of you who aren't already familiar, Blackwater is pretty shady all around. They are sometimes employed on behalf of the United States military to do the dirty work that the general military normally can't be bothered with. They are responsible for [war crimes in Iraq](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Academi#Role_in_the_Iraq_War); it's part of the reason that they founded a private mercenary firm in the first place. [They were even convicted in court.](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2014/oct/22/us-jury-convicts-blackwater-security-guards-iraq) These are the people the protestors are being abducted by. God help the protestors. If you get abducted, we don't know where you might end up. These aren't regular military armed forces, they are quite literally some of the shadiest motherfuckers you could ever be apprehended by.</TEXT>

Trump has mentioned being extremely interested in this on more than one occasion, which is deeply ironic considering how many of his family members own interests in China. But make no mistake, China is pissed at the United States. They are getting more favorable trade deals from their other Asian partners than they are getting from America, and we've already started a countdown until trade relations turn into a full blown embargo. That's going to be extremely ugly. No telling how massive the consequences will be.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I hate having to repeat this point, but I'm gonna say this AGAIN. That's what Fascism is. It's an ideology where **you MUST have an enemy to fight.** It's easier when you have an enemy that actively fights against fascism itself, because then they can BRAND you as the enemy. When the protestors stop being the enemy, it's going to be anyone that ever spoke out against fascism. When THEY stop being the enemy, it's probably going to be anyone who doesn't hasn't adjusted to fascist society as necessary. And so on, and so forth. No one's really reached an "endgame" in fascism because it's heavily implied that fascism is a belief system that results in near total fatalities for all but "the true Fascists", and even then you had better believe they would have infighting about who was "the best fascist" who was loyal to the authoritarian at the time. Protestors are an easy target because they are peacefully trying to protest a worsening fascist regime. There's a reason that the cops will never arrest the White Supremacists or the angry men with guns. That's because they know they're secretly on the same side; establishing a racial hierarchy. That's a pretty important step in fascism because it makes for an extremely easy enemy; white people vs. everyone else. And America, unfortunately, is a hotbed of the most racist activity the world has ever seen.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I feel like this is probably correct. Biden predicted that Trump would delay the election, then Trump tried to delay the election. Truth is, Trump will use every dirty trick in the book to stay in power. The alternative is \*gasp\* being forced to face his crimes in an actual court of law. Probably a full blown Nuremberg shakedown for letting thousands of people die. Oops.</TEXT>

Trump is a shell of the man who first earned their vote. He's this hollow, half-toned, rambling nutjob as of late. He's sure as hell not the same man who had the charisma to sell people on "draining the swamp" and crap. People liked him at first because his message was: "I am NOT a politician, I will FIX the things these people failed to do for you!" That didn't last long. In no time he was playing the same games as the other politicians, but a lot worse because he didn't even understand the rules. And now he's coming for your Postal Service. Good luck.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I can't say, I barely know anything about Peterson. But I can find some relevant quotes. The one like above, shows that Carlin deeply hated political correctness. He saw political correctness as an arrogant attempt to drive the moral nature of mankind in a specific direction because of how "offensive" it was. Carlin likely did not think that men's problems came from the same issues that Peterson seemed to assume they came from. Carlin occasionally complained about the ["pussification" of men](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSrzwB1DVFs) (especially strong men.) But as a whole he seemed to blame men's problems on the culture of how men saw themselves, in this [direct quote](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VLdT95OhZTs) here:  gt;So my way of thinking, men have only one real problem: other men. That's where all their trouble starts. A long time ago, men gave away their power; to other men. Princes, kings, wizards, generals, and high priests. They gave it away because they believed what other men told them. They bought the okey-doke. The bullshit.  gt;  gt;Men always buy the okey-doke when it comes from other men. So while Peterson's position is more or less attributed to a believe that men are subjected to culture that outright makes them more feminine, Carlin had a problem with male culture as a whole because he disliked how gullible that men had been throughout history. Peterson and Carlin are still wildly different individuals. Carlin built up his life and fame on the idea of "abandoning humanity" as he once said in a well-known interview. George realized that he had the most to gain in his comedic career by laying bare his most direct thoughts about the human race and it's problems. That's what makes Carlin great. He was raw, open, and generally transparent. He had no bullshit to hide behind because he was pouring out his heart and mind on stage, telling everyone what he really thought about the world.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>It's Apple, dude. I didn't mean a monopoly on the gaming market. I mean that they and Microsoft are two of the biggest computer companies on the planet. There really, REALLY should be more than just two mainstream commercial operating systems for computers. There's Linux, but you need some degree of previous computer knowledge (and arguably some extent of personal configuration) just to use it to it's fullest. There are no real competitors to the Big Two. There haven't been for years; and that's created a major problem for people.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Are you really here trying to defend an at least TRILLION dollar company from me trying to say that maybe it has at least a partial monopoly on the computing market? I'm not excluding Microsoft from this, either. They are every bit as guilty as Apple for basically creating impassable gaps that it is impossible for startups to ever hope to reach. The complexity of creating a brand new Operating System with no dependencies that functions as it should is, at borderline, completely ludicrous. You would have to have a team of extremely talented engineers basically take a Kernel, building a system from the console-level (at first), then systematically designing an entire modern GUI and functional computation spectrum that could be interpreted by existing hardware. Otherwise, all you really have is a Brick. What I'm trying to say here is, no one could realistically catch up to Microsoft OR Apple. They completely blast the competition out of the water completely, and there's a reason people have only heard of Windows, Macintosh, or Linux in their lives. That's because no one has (or could create, pending legal challenges) a rival system that could come close to any of the three. Not that people would bother to challenge Linux. I'm more talking about in a commercial sense.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>It's a lot more humane than you think. Farmers do it a lot, if I remember right. The animals are usually shipped completely safely- for the sake of getting livestock to locations in rural areas. It's actually one of the big reasons DeJoy is completely f*cking over the Rural South, whether or not he realizes it. Farmers *need* those animals, in a time where farming in the United States is already super tough because of the trade tensions between the United States, China, and possibly Europe.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Most people, especially Millennials, do not make this amount of money in a month. That's a fantasy amount of money. I'm barely clearing 2000 a month with my full-time job where MOST of my money immediately goes to bills. Then food. And the food has to be cheap. This is why wages should be raised, but unfortunately it will never happen without some historic level of intervention.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Whoa there. I admire that ambition but you kind of have to have a pretty good handle on Fusion just to get started on making something with this kind of complexity. If you're talking about a "map" type object that can show sections of an area at a time, that's pretty complex. Even I'm not entirely sure how to do that, but I know it's possible. I think maybe you should start off just creating an "alpha" for your game idea with really basic concepts and even sketches (or placeholders or whatever) of the things you want in the game. Work with those a bit, keep working on your ideas until you get something more solid, \*then\* it might be a good time to worry about using map editing and camera settings.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>It's absolutely a deeper, almost necessary desire to pretend like things are normal for our own sanity. It's a coping mechanism. Most people aren't equipped to handle something as serious as "our literal f\*cking world is coming to an end before our eyes" so they lie to themselves. The worst part is that the lies will continue getting worse until the truth becomes impossible to ignore. Who even knows how long before \*that\* happens. I was really hoping people dying by the thousands everyday would be serious enough to maybe merit some serious talking points and changing our old ways, but no. It's back to the same old bullshit. This time next year, we will (and indeed already have) at least a million people dead worldwide. In the United States alone, there will be at least 200,000 dead. And that's being extremely, naively conservative about the estimate. The more realistic projection is that there might be as many as 250,000+ people dead by that time, considering that no real effort has been made to stop the virus so far. America's government in particular is suicidally incompetent. They wouldn't change a damn thing unless Trump himself contracted the virus and started coughing up blood. Even then there's a chance they would just try to focus on shifting the administration to Mike Pence, assuming Micheal wasn't also sick. I feel like this isn't even the worst things can get. This is, very realistically, a "tip of the iceburg" scenario where there's an absolutely real possibility that things can and will get worse. I'm not going to tell people what they should be doing, but I'm going to (somewhat vainly) start preparing for things to completely go to Hell. What's happening now is still kids stuff compared to what's coming.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>As someone who is currently sacrificing pieces of their soul just to keep bread on the table, I'm with you. It took me months to find this job. It's only a year after I got hired that I found out they were having serious staffing problems and could barely manage to recruit people. They needed me more than I needed them. Jesus. I know you've probably gotten this advice from people before, but I want to encourage you to turn to friends and family to see if they know anyone who's hiring. If you don't really have that kind of network to depend on, there are always more unconventional jobs out there. You might even find something that isn't a regular 9-5 that you actually enjoy doing. Times are extremely tough right now. We live in unprecedented turmoil. I really hope you find something you can be comfortable with.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>It goes so much deeper than that, and the media needs to cover it that way. This is Trump's last attempt at trying to fool the American public into thinking that everything is "business as usual." It's impossible to say if people in this administration would even confirm if Donald Trump died in the next few days. Not only is it staged, but the fact that we're getting more factual information from Mark Meadows than Trump's own doctors leaves a lot for a stunned public to chew on. No one knows the complete story, we only know the story they are projecting for us to consume. Trump could be dead right now, and not even his most loyal supporters would know. That's some frightening shit. The highest office of government is trying to pull a fast one on us.</TEXT>

How much your entire life could change. Some of the people on the extreme right have a **"conform or die"** logic that is utterly terrifying, much worse than a typical Republican. Trump is extremely far right, despite how he tries to appeal to the center and left. This is a man who wants people to embrace Trump-friendly corporations, happily serve as part of his armies, and ultimately turn America into it's most terrifying possible future; a corporate cesspool. Have you been paying any attention to the news? Extrajudicial killings are on the rise. Not only by people of authority, but much more commonly by Trump-enabled fascists. Proud Boys, people of that nature. Disconnected sociopaths. Extremely dangerous individuals who will happily kill in the name of their ideals, all while citing how dangerous the "left" is. This election is a lot more than Biden or Trump. It's worth thinking about this long term. If you pull a 2016 and say "I really don't like either candidate," you are creating an unstoppable path to **fascism.** And believe me, you ***WILL NOT BE ABLE*** to live your life the same way ever again.

    <TEXT>That's the thing. It's not about /me/ working a shitty job. It's the fact that millions of Americans work in undesirable occupations and get paid extremely poorly for it. They are, in a sense *owned* by their employers in that it's extremely hard to get a well-paid job depending on location. I know this for a fact, because it's an extremely common problem in rural America. Which as you might guess, does not always have the best access to education or resources needed to gain the skills and/or credentials required for some decent paying jobs. In a grander sense, it can also be impossible for them to change locations, as well. There could be any number of things keeping them tethered to a location, not least of which is concerning finance. A secure and dependable place to stay is one thing, being able to afford it is another. And honestly on top of all of this is an impending debt crisis and a false-bottom economy that is threatening to crash at any given moment. We just don't know when. Many of these problems are almost always in-tow with one another because of incompetent leadership that sides with more insidious employers that are willing to pay politicians to side with them.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Hey. So I decided to start something I call the "10 line challenge." You basically start any non-custom prompt that already exists in AI Dungeon. Then, you proceed as normal. But here's the catch. * Every ten lines where a sentence BEGINS (as in, it's not just one long sentence going down to the next line) you must use the Story function to type "Suddenly" or "Suddenly," * Obviously this mode won't work if you're not in Creative, so you're mostly only bound to the rules of the challenge. Try not to cheat, it really ruins the fun. * Multiple sentences on a single line is fine. We're counting lines, not sentences. * You can edit nearly any sentence EXCEPT any lines that start with "Suddenly" * If the AI generates it's own "Suddenly" prompt, use that one instead. Including seeing the word "suddenly" in the middle of an AI generated sentence. * If the Suddenly prompt adds a line that BEGINS on the next line, that counts towards your 10. * You have not failed the challenge until your character is "dead", something "kills" you, or you are otherwise clearly unable to continue on. Seemingly fatal wounds don't count as long as you don't see "died", "dead", or "killed." **Good luck.**</TEXT>
