    <TEXT>Thanks! I got it from my father in law last winter. He'd had it for about twelve years, when he bought it it was already fairly large and climbing on three poles. He let the plant crawl over the floor and when I got it I gradually let it get used to hanging. I trimmed off a few super long stems ( gt;150 cm) that had damaged leaves. It grows really fast. I think I made around 50 cuttings so far and it is still bigger than when I got it. I repotted it a few weeks ago and it now pushes out several new leaves a week.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Thanks! I can't really take credit, when I got it it had been stored in a dark attic for around 6 weeks without water, but in the years before that it was well taken care of, so it's a pretty strong old plant. She just needs light, an airy substrate, and water, and she's happy.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I have sold the cuttings before, for around 10 euro's a piece. This time I have kept a few myself. I might try to sell or trade them later on. I want to trim another long branch off of the motherplant because it's a bit bare and damaged. But maybe it would be better to wait untill spring.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I would try submerging the roots and leaving the stem above water. I wouldn't cut into the roots now. I revived a Hoya that was just about as dead as this one is last year, but that at least had a few wrinkly old leaves left.. I think water and sunlight is your best shot!</TEXT>

    <TITLE>LPT If you lose your dog in unfamiliar terrain leave your coat overnight for the dog to find</TITLE>
    <DATE>2020-10-18 19:41:41</DATE>
    <TEXT>If your dog takes off in a panic when they are in unfamiliar terrain it may take them a good while to stop panicking and running. By the time they calm down they may be completely lost. If you have to stop searching at night you should leave your coat or a blanket that smells like you/your home/your dog at the place you were last together. If the dog retraces its steps at night and finds a familiar item they will often just lie down on top of it. If you make sure you are back at first light in the morning you might find them there waiting for you.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Dogs can wrestle out of their collar or harness when panicked. They can escape from a car, tent or house. Unforeseen circumstances exist.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>They can get pretty confused when they are out by themselves. Almost like they get so panicked they're afraid to approach anyone. Glad it worked out in the end. Maybe I'll add "lick some dogtreats" to the LPT.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>If she is truly an escape artist I would consider a GPS tracker! It's different with a rescue. Especially the ones that have lived on the streets or that have been abused. GPS may be the safer option then.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Some dogs can really get in a wild mental state when spooked. I recently read a news story about a dog that was sighted all over Europe over a period of months. It travelled in a straight line for thousands of km. In the end it was only caught because it ran out of land: the dog had reached the ocean and in its confusion allowed itself to be caught. It was unclear where it had started running and who its owners are.</TEXT>
