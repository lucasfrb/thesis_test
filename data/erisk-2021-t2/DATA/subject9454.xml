    <TEXT>Am going to use my Wildcard now, before GW4 starts. Which team should I go for? Team 1: Alisson | Etheridge Alonso | Holebas | Robertson | Mendy | Bissaka Salah | Walcott | Moura | Mkhitaryan | Neves Aguero | Zaha | Kamara  #8203; Team 2: Alisson | Etheridge Alonso | Holebas | Robertson | Mendy | Bissaka Hazard | Walcott | Moura | Mkhitaryan | Neves Aguero | Zaha | Mitrovic</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Yup essentially. But the thing is that Kamara isn't going to contribute any significant points so if I go with team 1, I get lets say 250 points from Salah at the end of the season while if I go with team 2, I'll be getting around 200 for Hazard and 100+ for Mitrovic. Seems like team 2 is the wiser option at the end of the day. Thoughts?</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Once Richarlison returns, I will be swapping him for Walcott and as for Moura, I think he might be able to displace Son if he keeps up his current form. Otherwise, I will probably swap him for Pedro or someone else</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Thoughts on transferring out mkhi? Played him as my first XI last gameweek and I got 1 point ... Him coming on in the last minute is worse than him not playing at all, at least that way I can play my first sub who plays a full 90. Don't really wanna risk this 1 point nonsense again. Any gooners out there with insider information?</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Hi Neal, really appreciate your content on youtube! Just wanted to ask your thoughts on my Liverpool hybrid with untradeable Militao and Ramos.
