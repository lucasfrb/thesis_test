    <TEXT>You may have heard news that an election is coming on the 12th December, so I've deployed a widget I had prepared for just such an occasion. The new widget watches the awesome [@BritainElects](https://twitter.com/BritainElects) Twitter account for their Westminster voting intention posts and then displays the results for you right here on reddit. If you're on the new redesigned reddit, you can see it on the right of the subreddit under the rules.

    <TEXT>This month we monitored the most active political subreddits related to UK politics and analysed what was posted. Here are the results. This stats engine is experimental and under development. Please let /u/subject1591 know about any problems or things you would like added. ## Basic Stats Subreddit|Total Posts :--|:-: **Grand Total**|16339 /r/ukpolitics|7558 /r/unitedkingdom|4050 /r/labouruk|1188 /r/greenandpleasant|958 /r/labour|775 /r/badunitedkingdom|755 /r/gbpolitics|247 /r/libdem|181 /r/tories|160 /r/the_farage|154 /r/britishpolitics|129 /r/ukipparty|72 ## Political Bias Which subs lean which way? We looked at the posts made to each subreddit, and checked the source bias using mediabiasfactcheck.com. The lower the score, the more left-leaning the subreddit. Don't like tables?

The system isn't perfect, the candidates and parties are all flawed (some more than others), but if you don't turn up today then you are only taking your voice out of the conversation. So go and vote, because if you don't like the choice this time then failing to vote only ensures it's the same choice next time.</TEXT>

    <DATE>2020-01-26 10:25:18</DATE>
    <TEXT>I've been asked this (or variants of it) a few times recently, usually by trolls, but it's an interesting question and I wondered what everyone else thought? * What does "finished" mean to you? Is there a definitive point or action? * Does Brexit finish when we're officially no longer members, at the end of transition, or when there's a new EU deal? * Will Brexit remain "unfinished" until the promises made by the varying Leave campaigns are fulfilled? * Will Brexit remain "unfinished" until we rejoin the EU? * Will Brexit remain "unfinished" until we no longer feel the effects? If the effects are, as predicted, permanent lost economic growth, does that mean Brexit is never finished? * Is Brexit going to be, like the closing of the coal mines, something where the effects are felt and it is cited as the cause of economic stagnation through multiple generations?</TEXT>

    <TITLE>The Boris Johnson "Autocomplete Interview"</TITLE>
    <DATE>2020-01-29 10:01:58</DATE>
    <TEXT>Boris [posted a bizarre video](https://twitter.com/BorisJohnson/status/1222280472132308993) where he answered questions the public were searching for answers to. It's called an [autocomplete interview](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLibNZv5Zd0dwjZFCTVZ8QdKq194CkwXjo) and the idea is you type some seed phrase into Google and see what people are searching for. Of course, being Boris, he was lying about what people were searching for. They used three seed phrases - "is boris johnson ...", "will brexit ..." and "does brexit ...". Here's what they pretended people were searching for: **Will Brexit ...** * affect my holiday? * help farmers? * help fishermen? * restore sovereignty? **Does Brexit ...** * happen on friday? * make my passport expire? * help companies export? * stop foreign students? **Is Boris Johnson ...** * for or against brexit? * going to sell the nhs? * multilingual? And here's what people are actually searching for (three real questions made it into Boris's lists): **[Will Brexit ...](https://i.imgur.com/9cjrvzJ.png)** * happen / happen on 31st / ever happen? * affect my holiday? * cause a recession? * party win seats? **[Does Brexit ...](https://i.imgur.com/QzMRhYj.png)** * affect travel? * affect ireland / affect scotland? * have to happen? * mean brexit? **[Is Boris Johnson ...](https://i.imgur.com/Mzkyaw8.png)** * married? (I assume it's mostly Boris searching for this one himself) * turkish? * american? * a millionaire? * going to sell the nhs?</TEXT>

    <TITLE>Setting Default Flair</TITLE>
    <DATE>2020-02-12 11:36:25</DATE>
    <TEXT>Hi. I'd like to set a default flair and add a comment where no flair is previously set by automod. I have a set of rules to flair specific domains, and if none of those are matched I want to add a general flair and a comment. Something like this: ``` # Flair a known domain domain: [whatever.com] set_flair: text: "Known Domain" template_id: 8c8e2978-ba7f-11e9-9c81-0eb3a9286ab2 --- # General unrecognised link posts type: link submission priority: -10 flair_text: "" set_flair: text: "Unknown Domain" template_id: 8c8e2978-ba7f-11e9-9c81-0eb3a9286ab2 comment: | This is an unknown domain. ``` I thought the priority and the flair_text tests would mean the second block only applied if the first block didn't. However, what I get is the flair from the first block and the comment from the second block. Which seems weird - all I can think is the second block is executing first, but I thought a negative priority would ensure it didn't. What am I missing?</TEXT>

    <DATE>2020-02-21 11:18:58</DATE>
    <TEXT>About six months ago, /r/GBPolitics was brought back from the dead and now stalks reddit like a political zombie. At the time, we posted [a thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/GBPolitics/comments/crq4oq/rules_civility_and_what_is_good_faith_anyway/) where people could ask questions about, and give feedback on, our rules (thanks again for the suggestion /u/UhhMakeUpAName). And we said we'd keep that active, and we have. Old threads get archived after six months, so a new one of these is needed every so often. This is that thread. So if you have questions, here's where you ask them. It's been a learning experience for me over the last six months. I've been playing with various bots (/u/GBPolBot now posts the papers here every day, and the sports pages to /r/CasualUK, and the cartoons to ukpol), and we've managed to get some nice features working here that have since been adopted elsewhere. We still have a daily thread, but the MPWatch threads have been demoted to a sidebar item (and need updating to monitor the current crop of MPs). We now track political polling in the sidebar. The Topic of the Week is a good idea, I think, but is mothballed until we grow a bit bigger. We still have a bit of a chicken and egg problem. People won't post unless they see enough sub activity ... but the sub has low activity because people don't post much. We have about a dozen regular posters and commenters, which is great, but I'm going to try a few new ways to bring people in over the coming weeks and months. So please feel free to throw your thoughts into the mix below. Questions, comments, feedback and suggestions are all welcome! This thread is also continuously monitored, so if you're seeing this in May and wondering if you can still contribute, you can :)</TEXT>

Which post the most accurate information? We looked at the posts made to each subreddit, and checked the source bias and accuracy using mediabiasfactcheck.com. The lower the bias, the more left-leaning the subreddit. The higher the accuracy the better (max 100).

    <TEXT>/r/PoliticsUK has had a complicated history. It's been active, then dead, then active, and most recently its been mostly pointing people towards /r/GBPolitics. A lot of people have been asked for a more neutral and less news-led UK politics sub, to this provided a great opportunity to turn /r/PoliticsUK into something interesting and active once again. We are working on setting up the sub, looking at subs like /r/NeutralPolitics and /r/PoliticalDiscussion for inspiration and sensible rules. If you have any suggestions for how you think the sub should run, let us know here or by modmail!</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Since Brexit there has been a lot of discussion about the idea of the UK having a written constitution. I'm curious what you all think. In favour of a written constitution: * It's clear * It's hard to change * Changes are highly visible In favour of an unwritten constitution: * It is flexible * It's not hard to change * It can provide a basis for making decisions on new issues and technologies What's your view? What problems would be solved, and at what cost, by changing to a written constitution?</TEXT>

    <TITLE>How should the UK handle important single issues, like NHS privatisation or Brexit?</TITLE>
    <DATE>2020-06-30 13:59:09</DATE>
    <TEXT>Historically, and until recently, referendums weren't really a thing in the UK. We relied on elections to make decisions. Unfortunately, in an election you vote on a manifesto. While a lot of a manifesto might be a tightly interlinked set of ideas (e.g., you might have both an increase in taxes and an increase in spending and consider that neither is much use without the other), sometimes voters will end up picking a manifesto based on agreeing with *most* of it, even if disagreeing strongly with *some* of it. The 2019 election is a good example. A lot of Tory voters chose them because they couldn't bring themselves to vote for Jeremy Corbyn. In that sense, the important policy in the Tory manifesto for them was "Not Corbyn". It's hard to say whether or not those people approved of anything else in that manifesto. Where a single issue has support across multiple parties, you also might find a manifesto goes completely against what the majority of the public wants. So if general elections are good for broad-stroke stuff but bad for single important issues, how should we handle them? Here are the options I know of, please let me know what I've missed! 1. System as now. Use referendums, where they are advisory and Government and Parliament are tasked with interpreting and implementing the results. Clearly, this option has some huge flaws - see Brexit for the obvious example. 2. Don't have referendums, but have extensive polling done to gauge opinion on issues. Susceptible to both the tyranny of the majority and accusations of democratic deficiency. 3. Use Citizen Assemblies to make recommendations. 4. Stop using referendums and polling and enable Government and Parliament to make decisions on these issue. Suffers from the problem outlined above, where a winning manifesto is assumed to have support for all of its contents. What do you reckon? Do you think it's a serious problem? How would you address it?</TEXT>

    <TEXT>The science seems pretty sound - if you wear a face mask when near other people your odds of giving it to anyone else are far lower. So why haven't we made them compulsory at some level? Personally, at a minimum I'd have thought anybody in an indoor public space and anyone in a customer-facing job should be required to wear a face mask or covering. What do you think? Is it a step too far for a government to make that law? Is it not worth it, either because you think it won't make a difference or you think the lives saved aren't enough to justify the requirement?</TEXT>

    <TITLE>How balanced was the debate over Brexit?</TITLE>
    <DATE>2020-07-14 09:14:43</DATE>
    <TEXT>I read [this](https://ukandeu.ac.uk/how-balanced-was-the-debate-over-brexit/) on the UK in a Changing Europe blog, and it was pretty interesting. The TL;DR is that between the referendum and the March 2019 original leaving date, the press gave far more time and attention to Tory and pro-Brexit politicians. The original paper is [here](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/2474736X.2020.1788955). My first thought was that this might well be natural. The party in power will be the one most talked about, and the PM will dominate the headlines. But that does not explain the relative high visibility of pro-Brexit backbenchers and the relative invisibility of anti-Brexit backbenchers. It also doesn't explain why any backbencher would be more visible than a serving cabinet minister. I'm not sure what this means in any broad sense, so I want to know what you think. Does this indicate a problem with bias in the press? Is it simply the result of commercial decisions - do these people and articles sell papers? Is the study missing something important? Does this give a decent idea of the relative power of people and positions within political organisations?</TEXT>

    <TITLE>CMV: MPs should be term limited to one or two terms</TITLE>
    <DATE>2020-07-18 07:01:14</DATE>
    <TEXT>I think there are a lot of problems with our political system, but some of the bigger ones are: * Re-electionism. Politicians are more concerned with how their decisions affect their chances at the next election rather than the real impact of those decisions. * Careerism. Politicians who have no experience of anything else. * Party-first. MPs must toe the party line or face losing their job. I think term limiting them is a good way to address these problems. With a single term, the party loses its stranglehold on MPs. Careerism isn't an option. And re-election does not matter. People who are good at it and successful can seek another term later if they wish. With two terms at a time, you keep some experience from one Parliament to the next, which isn't a bad thing. Buy you do bring back re-electionism. On the down side, you potentially lose out on experience and institutional memory. However, I don't see them counting for a lot at the moment anyway. One way to ensure that you can bring experienced voices into the mix would be to reform the Lords. That's a different topic, but a reformed HoL could allow people from all sorts of industries into the mix, so committees and other quangos can call on and include relevant voices as needed.</TEXT>

    <TEXT> gt; This is a point I don't think we'll agree on. We already agreed. You admitted they were unsafe. And if someone has a choice of being safe or unsafe, and they choose being unsafe ... then they're unsafe. That's practically a tautology.  gt; the refugee has no obligation to claim asylum in a safe country, and if they haven't claimed already then Dublin doesn't apply. That's correct, mostly. Part of Dublin still applies, in that they can be returned to the country where they were first fingerprinted while their application is processed. But that's not really worth doing in most cases, as I understand it. I think we probably only do that when they already have an application in progress somewhere.  gt; we should be helping these people so they don't have to cross the Mediterranean in the first place. Sure. But it's not like we can't do both. Personally, I think we should be bringing the refugees over the channel ourselves, to eliminate the risk of drowning and the people smuggling element. We can charge the same if we really need to, but the result is no more kids washing up on the beaches of Calais.</TEXT>

    <TEXT> gt; 1 - that blurs the line between a refugee fleeing an immediate danger to their life, and an economic migrant making a choice to better their life I don't see much of a point in drawing a distinction. They fled somewhere, they're looking for asylum, the rest is relatively unimportant. If I was in their shoes I'd go to the most appropriate place for me. The idea they are somehow less deserving or less in need because they could have claimed asylum elsewhere is a pretext most often used by people who usually just oppose helping refugees entirely.  gt; these people have not claimed asylum. You have no idea if that's true. I don't think it is, most of them claim asylum as soon as they land.  gt; I #8217;ve seen the camps in France. I would assume, though I might be wrong, that the people who end up in camps are there because they can't afford the crossing and are sneaking onto trucks etc. From the interviews with recent migrants I've seen, it sounds like most of the ones coming by boat are not hanging around in France first. I don't see why it matters either, it's not like they're putting down roots in those places.  gt; they must make their asylum claim in the first safe country in to which they arrive. The Dublin agreement is clear. No, there is no obligation on them to do that, and the Dublin Regulation doesn't say otherwise.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>With all due respect, that's a hot pile of steaming bullshit. Pretending it's about people trying to hammer a wedge is ridiculous. The reason people get angry is you let the mods get away with things you would warn and ban users for. You know pansies is a homophobic slur. The only action you should be taking is removing the comment and (privately) admonishing the person who used it. Same as you would for any user. How is it that it even requires an "at length" discussion?  gt; the amount of abuse sent to us via PM and modmail I would imagine that's because people are angry that you're not dealing with an obvious homophobic slur because it was posted by a mod. People will get angry when you don't hold yourselves to your own standards.  gt; People need to chill the fuck out and maybe consider that CoD possibly isnt the moustache twirling evil bastard hes made out to be. I don't think anybody suggested he has a moustache. It's not like there are only two positions here. It's not a binary choice between "defend everything every mod does at all costs" and "kick out a mod who breaks the rules". There's a middle ground of "mods sometimes fuck up, but they should be held to the same rules as everyone else - perhaps even to a higher standard".</TEXT>

Inflation is a thing,  #163;2tn today is far less in real terms than  #163;2tn ten years ago. That doesn't mean the debt is OK, or a good thing, but it does bring it into perspective a little. We would eventually hit that number if everything was going great. So don't get too hung up on the digits. Second, it's much more useful to look at the debt to GDP ratio, which passed a far more significant milestone. Debt is now 100.5% of GDP. It has been worse before, but not for 60 years.</TEXT>

    <TEXT> gt; Depicting longstanding leave activists as resistance cells  #8211; along with the very idea of a museum  #8211; suggests that Brexiters are now beginning to develop a kind of historical narrative of themselves above and beyond the immediate one of Brexit being  #8216;the will of the people #8217;. That's in keeping with their determination to see this as a modern retreading of WW2, where the European menace - German, really - is defeated by the plucky Brits. It's fantastical delusion, but it fits with a lot of the narratives I've seen. And however widespread that type of mentality is, there's obviously a concerted effort to make "Leave" a tribe and a political identity.  gt; \*\*It #8217;s really not satisfactory to keep using the word  #8216;remainers #8217; now that remaining in the EU is no longer an option. I just mean people who did not want to leave and still wish we hadn #8217;t. But to constantly use a term like, say,  #8216;erstwhile remainers #8217; would be very clumsy. I agree, and I don't think "remainers" are a group in any sense now anyway, regardless of label. Using it as a term, or finding a new term for the same group, feeds into that victim narrative that's fueling the Leave tribal identity. Criticism of Brexit comes from lots of places, including people and groups who voted Leave. More sensible to talk about people in the context of their criticism ... "pro-EU groups", "economists", "trade experts" etc</TEXT>

    <TEXT>There's two parts to each of those things, maybe three, and I think it's worth drawing distinctions between each. First, there is the ambition. The CAP and CFP are good ideas with laudable aims. We need to do what those things aim to do. Second, they have history. There have been significant mistakes - the dumping of food in Africa and discarding of bycatch being obvious examples. A lot of people want to judge them based on those mistakes alone, which is shortsighted. And then there is the current implementation, which is in many ways imperfect. There is a danger in criticising the second or third of those items that we also discard the first, and that would be a mistake. Jurisdiction doesn't matter much to me. I want us to honour the quotas we've sold to EU fishermen, and manage those shared stocks sensibly. That's not much different to what the EU wants. It should be what we want. It shouldn't be hard to get an agreement.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Imagine, for a moment, there was a song called "Women are too emotional to vote". Imagine it was sung every year in the Proms. A grand tradition, an uplifting song beloved by millions. Then women get the vote and the message of the song becomes embarrassing, archaic and the people singing it realise how it comes across to people whose feelings they'd never considered before. So it is with this. It is a tradition. It has been sung for 125 years. But society changes and moves on, and the fact this keeps coming up is the result. The fact we've done something for a long time isn't a good argument to keep doing it. Maybe the simplest thing is to change the words. We're not an empire any more. We don't rules the waves. We shouldn't be gloating about the fact we weren't slaves, when we were one of the countries involved in the slave trade. We shouldn't be celebrating war.

And most people learn that "but the other kids are doing it" isn't a useful argument by about age 7. You're making ludicrous comparisons, suggesting that changing a couple of songs from an annual concert is somehow the end of the UK as we know it.</TEXT>

    <TEXT> gt; no one is stopping you from singing a version of Rule Britannia that sanitises our own history to something that the woke would find more palatable. True, but if you think this conversation is about what I personally sing around the house, then I think you might need to read from the top again.

    <TEXT> gt; The core principle of conservatism is to conserve what we have inherited from society. Sure. It's sometimes a blanket opposition to change, which I think is probably more obvious in American conservatism.  gt; he basically said that the conservative goal of maintaining the good in society depends on managing change, not ignoring it Thanks for the link, I'll take a look when I have a chance - that's a meaty essay. But your synopsis sounds about right to me. Change happens, and society doesn't stand still. Traditions come and go. There are always several options, and nobody wants to throw the baby out with the bath water. I don't think the songs should be dropped completely - they're great piece of music. I'd rather keep the rousing, familiar, evocative parts of songs like Rule Britannia and Jerusalem in some form, but lose the baggage.</TEXT>

    <TEXT> gt; Not for the point you were trying to argue. Sure it is, and since so far all you've retorted with is "nuh-uh" I don't see much need to expand on it. If you change a single piece of art in some way, that change is permanent. Add a moustache to the Mona Lisa, and she's never going to be the same. Music is not the same. You can make a new version of a song, and the previous one remains exactly the same. Every recording still exists, nothing is lost. That is why the comparison to art is tosh. I pointed out that the idea it isn't ever changed is also false, because new versions of old art are created all the time, but the core argument doesn't hold water regardless.  gt; not really because you were suggesting editing it so it can remain in the gallery No, not at all. I'm suggesting that people go to galleries and the proms to enjoy art, and the art they enjoy changes. I don't really see how that's controversial, but here we are.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Care homes were asked by NHS managers and GPs to place blanket  #8216;Do not resuscitate #8217; (DNR) orders on all their residents at the height of the coronavirus pandemic to keep hospital beds free, a new report has found. The Queen #8217;s Nursing Institute (QNI)  #8211; the world #8217;s oldest nursing charity  #8211; discovered one in 10 care home staff surveyed was ordered to change DNR plans without discussion with family members, nursing staff, or with the residents themselves. Half of staff members who said they had been asked to change DNRs worked in homes for the elderly, while half worked in homes for younger people with learning or cognitive disabilities. Staff also warned that some hospitals were operating a  #8216;no admissions #8217; policy for care home residents  #8211; even for non-Covid-19 conditions such as heart attacks  #8211; and some said they had struggled to make appointments with GPs for elderly people. Ground zero: Covid-19 deaths registered in care homes Report author Prof Alison Leary MBE said the findings were  #8216;worrying #8217; and called for an inquiry. One anonymous respondent, when asked about DNRs, said:  #8220;We were advised to have them in place for all residents. We acted in accordance with medical advice and resident wishes, not as advised by a directive to put in place for all by a Clinical Care Group representative. We challenged this as unethical. #8221; Another said that DNRs were:  #8220;Put in place without family consent by trust staff, and no consultation with staff in the home. #8221; At the beginning of April NHS England medical director Stephen Powis wrote to NHS staff banning the use of blanket DNR forms after discovering a Port Talbot practice had asked elderly patients to complete forms to stop emergency services being called if they contracted Covid-19. A surgery in Somerset was also found to have told autistic adults they should sign DNRs to prevent resuscitation if they became critically ill. The learning disability care provider Turning Point said it had received an "unprecedented" number of  #8216;do not resuscitate' forms from GPs. However, it has been unclear how widespread the problem was until now. Alison Leary, Prof of Healthcare and Workforce Modelling at London South Bank University, said:  #8220;I was quite surprised how many people reported issues with DNRs, as I was expecting one or two.  #8220;But that 10 per cent of the respondents raised an issue, because they were either blanket decisions for whole populations, or they were imposed without discussion with the care home or the family or the residents, and that is really worrying.  #8220;These decisions were being made by NHS managers not clinicians. And this wasn #8217;t just happening with elderly people, it was those with learning disabilities or cognitive problems of all ages.  #8220;I think there should be an inquiry. The way the situation for care homes has been handled needs a retrospective view, particularly because winter is coming, which is always a difficult time for this group of people. #8221; The survey of 128 nurses and care home managers also showed that during March and April, one fifth reported receiving residents from the hospital sector who had tested positive for Covid-19. Nearly half said they had been sent residents from hospital before they had been tested, and one third said they had not always had access to appropriate personal protective equipment (PPE). Many care home staff said they felt  #8216;abandoned #8217; during the pandemic Dr Crystal Oldman CBE, the QNI #8217;s chief executive, said:  #8220;Overall, as would be expected, the picture presented is of an extremely stressful and anxious period for professionals working to care for and protect their residents.  #8220;More needs to be done to understand the effect of Covid-19 on the workforce and residents in care homes. "Urgent attention must be paid to the sector if the workforce is to withstand the additional demands of the pandemic, particularly in planning, guidance and employment practices. #8221;</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I don't know which bit you're asking about, so I'll give a brief answer to both. The loan system is repaid far more fairly. Those who need financial help can get it, and those who don't benefit from their degree to a significant extent don't need to repay it. It's not "debt" in the normal sense. The system isn't perfect, obviously, but it's a good balance between the needs of the student and the benefit they get from their degree. Laying more of the cost of something with the people who benefit from it seems reasonable to me as a basic principle. I think society should bear some of the cost, but I think if you're earning 500k more as the result of something it's fair that you contribute a little more than someone else on the same salary who got their without incurring the same costs on society in general.</TEXT>

At the moment, the cost is shared. Right now, society pays for a lot of it, students pay for a lot of it. It's a balance.  gt; It's such a ludicrous argument. Yeah, it is.

    <TEXT> gt; That would also happen if you funded it through income tax? No, it wouldn't. That would mean that the people who got their education without an expensive degree were charged the same as someone who did get it. It doesn't put the cost of the degree with the person who benefits from it, it puts it with people who earn more regardless of whether they incurred a cost on society. For the record, paying for it as a graduate tax isn't a bad idea, and I have no issue with that. I think it's entirely reasonable to fund a proportion of degrees by taxing graduates specifically.  gt; Better in fact, as rich students couldn't buy their way out of the above inflation interest rate on the current loans. Rich students are paying the entire fee earlier, meaning the government gets the money earlier, and that money can then be used. It's not like paying it off earlier is a bad thing for society. And sure, it means richer students won't pay more interest ... but unless you're suggesting a wealth tax on students I don't see how you eliminate financial advantages for rich students.  gt; Btw, you are aware the current system costs the government the same as the last one? No, and I have no idea if that's correct or why it would be relevant.</TEXT>

    <TEXT> gt; No other private service would say " I charge more for higher earners". No, every other private service makes you pay for what you use. And if you can't afford it, you can take a commercial loan. Society is funding part of the bill here, and that's a good thing. But our limited resources should be directed appropriately. Which they are, under the current system.  gt; Solve it by having 3k fees and CPI linked inflation. So you're OK with the principle? Great, not much point in continuing the discussion then. I'm all in favour of them tweaking the fees and interest to find a good balance, but that's getting into specifics that I don't have the knowledge or experience to comment on.  gt; You seriously don't realise why the system not saving any money for the government is relevant? Yes ... in general, you need to actually make your argument rather than just feign disbelief that someone else doesn't already think the same way. There are lots of reasons the cost of thing might remain the same, and you've presented no reason for me to believe it's a problem that it has done. For example, if it's the same because the number of students has gone up, that would be great. If it's the same because the load is being shared more fairly, that would be great. If it's the same because more money is going into better places in the system, that's great. The total figure isn't all that useful here.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>There are two fairly important points to note. First, having had covid once does not mean you cannot *catch* it again, even if immunity is conferred. It means you will be able to fight it off a second time much more easily, hopefully so easily you don't even notice you have it. Immunity doesn't mean the bug somehow avoids you, it means your immune system is capable of dealing with it much more easily and quickly. Second, the testing for covid is far from perfect. False positives and false negatives are both significant problems in testing. We should expect to see people with one positive test, then a negative test, then a positive test, even if being infected once made you immune in future. It may well be you can be reinfected and that is a serious problem, but don't let the occasional example worry you at this stage.</TEXT>

    <TEXT> gt; What is this cultural war being fought for? It's not being fought. It's basically just angry bigots crying because when they say and do abusive things now they get called out for it. It's got several components and angles and varies from country to country, but one obvious recent example of it is the early stages of the George Floyd protests in the USA. On one hand, you had a huge number of people protesting racist police brutality. On the other, you had a bunch of far-right racists who were upset at the idea that police shouldn't be able to kill black people whenever they like. The second group have tried - successfully now - to make it a "culture war" by claiming all sorts of insane things, most recently where some prominent idiot tried to pretend the protests were an attempted coup. Fundamentally it's a largely (and far from universally) right-wing political tactic, where any change they dislike is presented as some sort of attack.</TEXT>

    <TEXT> gt; What's the point if they aren't even paying the same tax as everyone else. The point is that companies are what create jobs. Someone working in an existing company as an employee, who decides to leave and do their own thing, may end up creating something of value, employing people and generating far more in tax than they ever would as an employee. One route to doing that is to do what they were doing before as a freelancer, and growing their business into an agency or a vehicle to branch out into something else. That's all stuff we want to encourage, right? So how do we do that if not with financial incentives directly related to success?  gt; abuse of this system is rife It was, but IR35 is designed to deal with people who are working as employees through a personal service company. There is a big difference between a contractor avoiding tax, and a small genuine company, and the second is what we want to encourage.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>That depends. In my case, I couldn't furlough anyone because we were still providing the same service to customers who had already paid us. No SBRR grant because we use coworking spaces. We could take a loan, but obviously that was seen as not enough support for most people or the furlough scheme wouldn't exist. And a loan is not the same as a grant, for obvious reasons, and it would affect businesses' ability to hire and grow in future. Businesses may be able to survive with a loan, but I assume the measure of success here is not just survival, but recovering economically as quickly as possible, which you can't do if your small businesses are all carrying lots of new debt. As it happens, my company did OK. It was all unpredictable for a while, and we lost some business, but we also gained new business and ended up pretty even throughout. We've been lucky. A lot of people in a similar position were not, and have ended up now facing a ropey economy with new debt. That's not going to make for a great 2021 for anybody.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>The Rule Britannia "controversy" is a great example. It was manufactured outrage over something the majority of the people complaining don't actually care about and that doesn't affect them in any significant way. And if you read rags like the [Spectator](https://www.spectator.co.uk/article/ditching-rule-britannia-s-lyrics-from-the-proms-is-a-step-too-far/amp) or [Express](https://www.express.co.uk/news/uk/1326417/bbc-rule-britannia-land-of-hope-and-glory-last-night-of-the-proms-protests) talking about it, it's being painted as an attack on patriotism and on Britain, as though the BBC doing a few songs instrumentally meant that you weren't allowed to enjoy those songs anymore. Never mind that you can still find plenty of places to watch, listen to and sing along with them, this is presented as "wokeists" attacking Britain itself. Never mind that this decision is about covid, this is presented as "disdain for the British people". It's a couple of songs, at an annual concert most people never get to go to. But to hear the "culture war" crowd talk about it, you'd think any change was the absolute and total end of British culture.</TEXT>

Some pay for a year's service up front, some monthly. We can't suddenly stop providing support or stop fixing bugs. And we were lucky, but other companies in a similar situation saw their new subscriptions dry up and their cancellations shoot up. So their revenue was cut, but they still had to provide a service.  gt; I'm glad you're okay, honestly. Thanks.

    <TEXT> gt; If you want to go and do your own thing go ahead, but I don't think you should be getting tax reductions for that. OK. So how *should* we encourage it?  gt; I don't see why the latter should be encouraged. The latter can lead to more employees. The former cannot. More jobs is a good thing, especially for taxes.  gt; Additionally there is room for a level of growth that isn't available to an employee. That is the incentive to run your own thing. A lot of people don't start their own thing looking at growth. Not everybody's reasons are the same, but the increased take-home is a big one early on. I went freelance as a web developer in 2012 for several reasons and that was one of them. Now I run a product business with employees. The second part wouldn't have happened without the first. Would I have still made the same decisions in 2012 if there hadn't been a financial benefit? Difficult to say, but I think probably not.  gt; someone who runs a business doesn't use less of the services provided by the government so why are they paying less? I think it's important to look at the bigger picture. They might be paying less as an individual, but the venture they started is paying far more than they would have paid staying as an employee (assuming they're not working alone etc).</TEXT>

I was thinking about the short ones, for which showering and changing facilities are not nearly such an issue. 68% of car journeys are less than five miles, which most adults of working age should be able to manage without dissolving into a puddle of sweat (and certainly would be able to after doing it a few times).</TEXT>

    <TEXT> gt; I also disagree with the notion that the only way to create more jobs is by going off and setting up your own company. Nobody said that was the "only way". But in reality, every company has started somewhere, so that job you go on to describe ... that relied on someone starting a company too.  gt; The reality is if you earn  #163;X you should pay  #163;Y in taxes regardless of who you are, any deviation from this is inherently unfair. I think it's more complicated than that. Again, because there is a benefit to encouraging some behaviours. For example, we don't tax pension contributions in the same way, because we want people to have a decent pension. Is that "inherently unfair" as well? Or is it a very sensible decision by society to provide an incentive for something we want people to do?</TEXT>

That said, you get credit for taking the time to think through an answer and reply. Thanks.  gt; Philander: Affair with Abbott One relationship after your marriage has separated is nowhere near philandering. It's barely an affair. And one instance of whatever that was is not anywhere near enough to demonstrate you can trust him to philander.  gt; Lie: 24hrs save NHS lie; Tories selling NHS off lie, Queens speech lie, also had lying fb ads etc. Sure. Politicians do lie. All of them. Corbyn's record is not spotless. But, as with the previous item, these issues are the exception rather than the rule.  gt; Put himself before everything else: Put his ego above the party, country, and even not bothering to campaign properly during the election. Sure, I'll give you that one. He should have stepped down after the 2017 election, or when he was VoNCed by his own party. If he had, we very likely wouldn't now be going through with Brexit.  gt; Bluster: can i finish? can i be allowed to finish, can i finish etc. That's not what bluster is. Not even close.  gt; Prize loyalty over competence: his entire fucking frontbench lol, Momentum lol, The membership lol, the twitter mob lol, the London youth lol etc. Perhaps. With his shadow cabinet, he (from what I remember) mostly appointed pretty good people to the key roles. He cut them when they went against the party line, which is pretty normal, but I don't remember him kicking anyone out of the party altogether for voting wrong.  gt; Fair enough, seemed like a not very risky guess.

For example, Theresa May holding hands with Trump gave us a week of jokes, whereas Corbyn never even got to meet with Trump.

Sometimes, clothing and styles and body art have a deep meaning to some culture or other. Would you go to New Zealand, have your face all covered in Maori ink, and expect nobody to say anything? I would hope most people going there would have found out the significance of it to the Maori and so they wouldn't do that. Should they be allowed to? Of course. Should they be free from criticism? No, it would be deeply offensive to some Maori people and they should be free to express that as well. It's been broadened to include things with little to no actual significance, or with little to no historical connection.</TEXT>

    <TEXT> gt; we were below average at the start of the year before COVID hit. That can #8217;t be explained by mortality displacement, so why should we think that being below average can be explained by that now? Mortality fluctuates, of course. You'd need to look into the figures more specifically. But it's ludicrous to suggest we're not seeing some mortality displacement in there.  gt; We can #8217;t really start considering mortality displacement until we #8217;re at least 4% below average. You'd need to look into the specifics to say that with any certainty at all. A warm winter or a better-than-usual flu season, for example, could have easily affected the stats in the early part of the year but there's no reason to expect causes like that to persist significantly later in the year.</TEXT>

    <TEXT> gt; how far do fish travel? This is, sadly, pretty typical of a lot of Brexiters. They have no clue what they are talking about, and they jump in with both feet anyway.  gt; Also less or no EU vessels in UK waters would harm or help protect fish stocks? It doesn't make any difference. It's the total catch for a stock that is the thing that affects the longevity of that fish stock. How it is split, and where the fishermen catch those fish, doesn't matter much. If an EU fisherman comes into UK waters to catch a North Sea cod, or does it off the coast on Denmark, doesn't make any difference.  gt; We could also ban certain types of fishing if we wanted. We already can, and as far as I know nobody significant is arguing in favour of doing so.</TEXT>

    <TEXT> gt; Care to enlighten me? No, not really. If you want to dig into fish migration and stock management, be my guest, but it's way beyond the scope of a reddit comment to get into details.  gt; I'm not an expert on fish migrations. Neither am I. I understand that the CFP only applies to shared stocks, and shared stocks are partly to do with migration and partly to do with population spread.  gt; Doesn't make a difference? Then what is the EU worried about? They are worried about: * Making sure we collectively manage fish stocks so those stocks last. That means all the nations who share a stock need to agree both a total allowable catch and then split that TAC. * Making sure we honour the quotas we have already sold to fishermen of the EU. * Ensuring that we and they can continue to sell the fish stocks we currently catch as easily as possible. Our position is that we don't want to use the same system that the CFP uses to share stocks. We want to use a system which is, arguably, better. However, that system is already in use between Norway and the EU and is already a major headache for both parties despite only covering 1/12th of the species the UK-EU one would need to cover.</TEXT>

    <TEXT> gt; This applies especially to the two hottest issues #8212;fisheries and rules to stop one side using state subsidies to undercut the other. Both of which it is in our interested to concede on. * Fisheries - we agree with the principles and we're asking for something we know is unworkable. I think that's probably to allow us to concede to something we know we're OK with in return for something else. * State aid - our businesses stand to benefit far more from agreeing a deal than from looser state aid rules. Plus, the Tories will think they can just ignore those rules anyway, so conceding this is pretty minor. I think it's probably just brinksmanship on our part. I'm expecting Boris to announce (again) that he's taking personal control later in September, he'll make a few calls in October and then claim to have saved the deal himself, and we'll agree the text as it stands with fisheries managed as per the EU agreement and the EU state aid rules with some minor concession.</TEXT>

    <TEXT> gt; So the EU is not stating that they want to control amount of investment subsidies and other form of aid the UK Govt can provide to UK companies? is this the case or not? No, they are saying they want a level playing field, where the UK cannot use state subsidies to undercut EU companies. They aren't going to be allocating state aid, they're want us to abide by the same rules for the same market access for goods. Pretty simple stuff. It's nothing to do with "being scared", and everything to do with not undermining the single market.  gt; And the EU are not asking that the current quota system and right for EU fishing ships in UK waters to continue? is this the case or not? It very much is the case, yes. But it's not a "larger quota than UK fishing ships from UK waters". Quotas are not allocated based on a country's waters, they are allocated based on stocks spanning far larger regions spanning the waters of multiple countries.  gt; And, what precisely are the UK Govt asking for? In these two instances we are asking for (though it changes regularly): * The right to use state aid to help our companies undercut EU companies * Allocation of fish stocks based on a far more complex system (one which barely functions between Norway and the EU despite covering barely 8% of the number of species the UK-EU deal needs to cover), or a larger proportion of the total quotas for fish. The first is absurd. The second is pointless. We've also started to try to crowbar in some stuff about refugees, for some reason.  gt; the only 'claim' being, that without more transparency, they're playing a bad game. Except they're not. Their position has been the same since the start. Level playing field. Conserve fish and allocate quotas fairly. Honour past agreements. Ours has been that we want the same access but not to follow the same rules - cherry picking, like we've been trying from the start.</TEXT>

    <TEXT> gt; "Level playing field" is rhetoric. It's a straightforward phrase that adequately describes the aims of the EU. Boris wants the right for the UK to undercut EU businesses with state aid. They're not going to agree to that, obviously. Boris knows this, so he's either going to capitulate or he is going to use it as an excuse for a no-deal exit (despite having the ability to request more time to resolve the issue). I think it's probably the former.  gt; They accept that massive state subsidy is necessary if you want a viable tech industry. They accept that subsidy is necessary. But it doesn't need to come directly from the state. You can have a multi-state economy where no individual state can undercut another with state aid, while allowing the group as a whole to decide what state aid is OK. Voila, you end up with beneficial state aid without damaging competition. Hey, and that sounds a lot like the current system ...</TEXT>

You're overlooking the fact that the majority of people voted for parties which were offering a second referendum. Our electoral system means it is deeply spurious to try to imply support for a single policy based on the seats won.</TEXT>

By not showing up to endorse change, by default they are on the status quo side. This is the problem. At the moment we assume that these people split along the same lines as people who voted, but that's extremely unlikely. It's a known problem that it's harder to get people to bother to vote for the status quo than for change, for example.  gt; this is especially true when, as is likely, they're not given a "none of the above" type option. There's no reason, if we're redesigning the system, that you can't make sure there is always a "don't know / don't care" option. But I don't see much need for it. If you support a change, you vote yes to it. Otherwise you vote no.</TEXT>

    <TEXT> gt; their default is to go wherever the wind is pointing because they're not endorsing the status quo either. The point is they are not endorsing the change. There's a proposal made, and they don't support it enough to vote for it. Doing nothing is implicitly endorsing the status quo - it's indistinguishable from indifference. It's partly down to how it has been framed - do you want Option A or Option B? But it's not that. It's: we already have Option A, now do you want to change to Option B? There is a default position. If you are standing in front of nine mates and say "hands up who's up for a curry", and three of them put their hands up, you don't then say "hands up who opposes a curry", because you already had the curry rejected from the first show of hands.  gt; Democracy has to organically engage the electorate.

    <TEXT>The problem is that most people who voted for the Tories this time didn't vote for them thinking they'd uphold the rule of law. They'd already proved they had no respect for the law before the election. They didn't vote for them expecting them to tell the truth, because they'd already proven they had no integrity. They didn't vote for competence, because this shower of idiots had already proved themselves incompetent time and again. I reckon they mostly voted for the Tories for one of three reasons: 1. They're Brexit zealots with no capacity for critical thinking and a willingness to sacrifice anything at the altar of their favourite nationalist project. 2. They bought all the right-wing anti-Corbyn fearmongering. So it doesn't matter what the Tories do, those people can always pretend it would have been worse with Corbyn. 3. They are angry at the world, at their own lack of success and hopeless situations, that they want everyone else to feel the same level of hopelessness and rage. None of those people is going to look at this and think it's a bad thing.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Dad of identical twins here. There's often some way to tell - a birthmark, a mole, something like that. If not at birth, there likely will be before the babies are old enough to move around on their own, so it's easy enough to keep track. Some people make a dot on the foot of a baby to tell the difference, but you have to use the right type of pen or the ink can become permanent. For ours, there was a birthmark but it wasn't visible when they were dressed. So we used colour coding, based on the cuffs and collars (for want of better words) of their onesies. One only wore clothes with blue or green trim, the other wore the other colours. We never told anyone else the system, so we could tell them apart at a glance but nobody else had a clue. They're almost five now and easy for us to tell apart in any number of ways. Also, I haven't had a proper night of sleep in years.</TEXT>

I think it's probably important to recognize the distinction between working remotely and working from home. You don't need to be all working from a central shared location, but that doesn't mean you can't work from a coworking space or other shared venue. That's how my company does it - everyone gets a small budget to work with to set themselves up for work. I use it to rent a small private office near where I live. Someone else uses it to pay for two coworking spaces because they like the variety. No central office needed.</TEXT>

    <TEXT> gt; The state of discourse now is significantly worse. I don't think it's discourse that's changed, I think it's just that as Brexit has got worse and worse, and the promises made have been progressively rolled back or undone, the number of people willing to defend it has dropped. Every time there's a prorogation or another failure to deliver on what people thought they were getting, it gets that much harder for people to continue to defend it. It's no surprise that the balance has shifted. If it was going well, it would have shifted the other way. Incidentally, a few of the current loud anti-Brexit voices on UKPol are (anecdotally, based on my own interactions with some of them) very angry ex pro-Brexiters.</TEXT>

IIRC there was a large influx of people who were angry about the vote and the implications of the vote, and were looking for somewhere to express that. I don't think it was people leaving, though doubtless there were some; I think it was a lot of new people joining, and that left a decent chunk of the previous users feeling quite angry at the dramatic and quick change in tone on ukpol. Hence, this place.</TEXT>

    <TEXT> gt; What does everyone realistically think is going to happen with Brexit by Jan 1st then? I don't think the situation has changed much. I don't think even Boris is stupid enough to completely undermine our ability to negotiate trade deals at the exact point we need to negotiate them, so I think the bill he's threatening is intended as a bit of leverage. If there's an FTA, the amendment to the WA doesn't really matter much. It's also a little pandering to the far right of his party, to help convince them he's still on their side. So, I think he'll take a minor concession or two from the EU on fishing and state aid, claim victory and get the deal done. It'll be damaging, but he can claim success and his followers will lap it up. The other way, he would need to blame the EU for the failure, which is hard to do when it was his own decision to undermine the WA and refuse to allow enough time to get the deal done. He might be able to convince the hardcore Brexit fans he's done a good job, but I think he'd lose a hefty chunk of the more moderate conservatives. And then what? He can't get them back easily, he can't appeal to centrists or the left, so what prospects are there for 2024?</TEXT>

I have no idea if his use of drone strikes would have changed the outcome, but I would hope so. Although I would also point out that drone strikes are much better than sending in troops. And if you think drone strikes should be a factor in the decision, you should note that Trump has embraced drone strikes with great enthusiasm as well, including ramping up the numbers and rolling back various reporting - like on [civilian deaths](https://www.thebureauinvestigates.com/stories/2019-03-07/trump-tells-cia-dont-tell-world-about-dead-civilians) - that was in place when he took office.</TEXT>

    <TEXT> gt; I don #8217;t see how it #8217;s gotten worse though. Please. We've gone from "no economic damage, sunlit uplands, we hold all the cards, buckaneering Britain" etc in 2016 to "no deal with added sanctions will be fine, it's not as bad as the Blitz". Even if you ignore all the economic damage, companies moving overseas etc, the parliamentary Brexiters aren't even bothering to try and pitch it as a good thing any more, just something we're obliged to do because "the people" voted for it.  gt; The moderation now leans very heavily on right leaning users and is virtually nonexistent for left leaning ones. I don't think they lean either way particularly, but from my experience it seems very much to depend which one picks up a report or sees a comment or post first. Once one of them makes a decision, the others stick with it in a sort of collective responsibility. Even if they privately admit it's a terrible decision. There are not many non-troll right wing posters on there, for whatever reason - probably largely because it's not very welcoming to post something right-wing and be dog-piled to oblivion, as can happen. I think there are probably similar numbers of right-wing trolls and left-wing trolls. So if all they did was ban trolls, it would look like they were picking on right-wing people, because the proportion of right-wing people who had been modded in some way would be far higher. Unfortunately, that perception creates a feedback loop, where it's really easy for right-wing posters grow a victim complex. It's not hard to resolve either. Put in a public moderation log, and admit when mistakes are made, and I reckon that would be pretty much problem solved.  gt; A lot of the mods there seem to be enjoying the theatre of being a mod without having to do any of the actual unpleasant stuff that would keep their community alive. Most of the mods seem to be inactive, and there are clearly pretty significant divisions among the mod team. It's a shame, because if the community can respect the mod team, even if they disagree with them, then it'll be a positive place.</TEXT>

    <TEXT> gt; you've provided no logic for why it's less compelling It's an expression of opinion. I find those points less compelling. I'm not arguing that you should; it's up to you to decide what you feel is more important. Personally, I find it more worrying that police are doing something that potentially puts themselves and others in greater immediate danger than they are breaking with impartiality rules. I would guess that those rules you are referring to also prioritise the health of officers and the public over impartiality?  gt; In my opinion, the problem with your view is that you're willing to overlook a serious breach of a centuries old tradition of impartiality because it supports a cause that is close to your heart. I'm not sure you read or understood my original comment at all. I said I was a little torn, and that I could see a few different arguments. You're acting like I've said it's OK and that I disagreed with your points - neither of which I have done.

    <TEXT> gt; When Keir asked you for evidence, you began deflecting. No, when Keir accused me of "bad faith" for not giving a proper response to "[nuh-uh](https://www.reddit.com/r/badunitedkingdom/comments/irqk0t/news_mega_13_09_2020/g55xb01/?utm_source=reddit amp;utm_medium=web2x amp;context=3)", I responded by doing exactly what he asked. He wanted me to respond to his argument - he said:  gt; argue what I said and discuss why I am wrong. Which is exactly what I did. Of course he's upset, he's made himself look a total plum. He even went on to ask a basic question about the thing he replied to, demonstrating he didn't know what my original point was when he replied to it. Frankly, I expected better given his posts elsewhere but here we are. Now, if anyone wants to discus the original point, I'm happy to do that. Make a reply to it, without abuse and accusations, and we'll go from there. But starting off with "nuh-uh" and then accusing me of bad faith for not giving some in-depth reply to that "nuh-uh" is embarrassingly poor form.</TEXT>

I can see it being an argument for greater political education, but little more.  gt; Common fisheries policy, yet more destruction of the environment for financial gain CFP is a necessity, and one we will keep the principles of after we leave. The alternatives to CFP are rampant overfishing, or ... what?  gt; The single market takes precedence over the environment The single market enforces environmental protections that would be almost impossible without it.  gt; Ever more centralising of power with every crisis You already lazily whined about cerntralisation without actually making an argument.  gt; Eurozone debt, not stopped printing money since the last recession We're not in the Eurozone, and not on the hook for its debts. Looks like /u/Kassdhal88 was right, no arguments on that side of the debate.</TEXT>

    <TEXT> gt; there are a lot things in the European Union that need improvement. I think this is where a lot of anti-EU redditor arguments fall down. They find some problem which is real, and claim that's a reason to leave. There's rarely even a moment of contemplation that maybe leaving is an overreaction to that problem or that we'd be in a better place to fix it if we stayed in. It's little more than post-hoc rationalisation of a decision already made for entirely different reasons that the poster either doesn't know or doesn't feel they can express.</TEXT>

You just described Brexit in its entirety. But the idiotic argument goes that Brexit would be great were it not for Remainers sabotaging it. Like when those dastardly Remainers voted against the withdrawal agreement (so that'll be Remainers like Boris Johnson and Michael Gove), even though that same deal eventually passed. It's the same as the "remainers didn't know what they were voting for either" argument, it's trying to pretend the choice was between two complete unknowns, so any result of Brexit can be hand-waved away with the pretence that it all could have been worse if we'd stayed in.</TEXT>

    <TEXT> gt; But why would he not just go and lie about meeting people? No idea.  gt; It makes no sense! OK. It also makes no sense an airport would make the whole thing up. Someone's made a mistake or is lying. It seems it'd be easy enough to prove, if Boris was in the UK - he's photographed pretty constantly. I guess we'll find out what happened either way sooner or later, but even if he was there this seems pretty insignificant next to his lengthy history of lying and fuckups. That said, when it comes to credibility I'd take the word of any random airport employee over Boris and his Tory cronies every day of the week.  gt; Who is he supposed to have met with anyway? As I understand it, his typical hangout in Perugia is Evgeny Lebedev's pad. I don't know if Lebedev was there at the time, but that's the name I've seen repeatedly.</TEXT>

    <TITLE>Wildcard Searching</TITLE>
    <DATE>2020-09-21 16:39:09</DATE>
    <TEXT>I can see it's possible to search using wildcards in certain positions, but it's not clear to me exactly how that works. For example, if you search for "banana\*", you get results including "banana", "bananas", "bananaman" etc - the \* is a wildcard that covers optional suffixes without an apparent maximum length. It works in a similar way in the middle of text as well, but not identical. If you search for "banana\*an", it will match text like "**banana**, added yoghurt, **an**d" ... but not "bananaman". What I want to do is search by a suffix. So, for example, comments containing words ending in "man". But "\*man" doesn't work. Is this a limitation of the system, or is there a trick to this kind of search?</TEXT>

It's got nothing to with the privatisation, this was the [result of EU laws](https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2016/jun/09/what-has-the-eu-ever-done-for-my-beach). (And our water quality is still [relatively low](https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2020/jun/08/only-two-thirds-uk-bathing-waters-rated-excellent-eu-survey-wild-swimming), privatisation hasn't helped us outperform any nation where water isn't privatised).  gt; Scrapping franchises is not a failure of privatisation, but of the franchise system which was criticised from the start. This failure doesn't mean privatisation of rail cannot work in general, but it's still a failure of privatisation.  gt; Doesn't matter if your GP's office is a private business, the hospital you visit is leased from a private company and the radiologists are actually working for Virgin Health so long as it all fits together seamlessly. Except when it doesn't. When you introduce private companies into the system you start to introduce delays and mistakes with data sharing, measuring of success, handling of post-treatment complications, barriers to doctors overlapping disciplines, and you make profit a motivating factor in the medical system.</TEXT>

    <TITLE>100 Days of Transition Left. Where are we heading?</TITLE>
    <DATE>2020-09-22 09:45:08</DATE>
    <TEXT>There are just 100 days left of the transition period, and here's my understanding of where things stand: * The new FTA is not agreed, with some 40 or so days left for it to be agreed (it needs time to be ratified by the EU member states). * Despite the lack of time, and coronavirus starting its expected second wave, there's no signal the UK government is willing to seek any sort of extension to the transition period. * The blockages in the FTA are not all that substantial - a minor quibble about fishing, and a bigger disagreement about state aid. The UK government could concede both and get the deal done, with no detriment either to the UK's sovereignty or its fishing. * The UK is undermining the WA agreed at the start of the year, and in doing so damaging its own credibility in these negotiations and beyond. * No-deal preparations are laughably behind, in some cases [barely started](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-northern-ireland-53362652). After several no-deal bluffs, and with coronavirus still wreaking havoc, and with no real idea what the trade situation will look like in January, businesses are even less prepared than previous similar situations. So to me it looks like there are three possible outcomes, and I wondered which you thought was most likely (or a different one, if that's what you think likely): 1. FTA agreed in time. This seems most likely. I think Boris will U-turn, sign the deal, claim some minor concession as a great negotiating victory and then set to work undermining the deal and blaming the EU and covid for the economic fallout that follows in January and beyond. 2. An extension. This seems most sensible, so obviously least likely. I don't think even the looniest Brexiters would seriously object in the circumstances. Only those who see coronavirus as an opportunity to divert Brexit blame elsewhere can possibly oppose an extension. 3. No deal. If this was a serious option, I would have thought there would be actual preparation. It's one thing for Boris to lead the country into no deal, it's quite another for him to do it in such a cavalier fashion. Even if he believed he had no choice but to no-deal, there's nothing stopping him and his cronies from actually putting in the work to make sure the disruption is as minimised as possible.</TEXT>

    <TEXT> gt; Brexit red tape set to create weeks of delay for patients awaiting drugs  gt;  gt; Pharmaceutical groups call for  #8216;mutual recognition #8217; to avoid duplicating processes  gt;  gt; In a rare joint intervention, ahead of the resumption of trade talks on Tuesday, the bodies representing the UK and European pharma industries called for a  #8220;mutual recognition agreement #8221; to ensure tests and inspections on medicines carried out on one side of the English Channel are considered valid on the other, as currently happens through the UK #8217;s membership of the European Medicines Agency.  gt;  gt; The processes will otherwise have to be duplicated after the end of the Brexit transition period on December 31, risking delays of up to six weeks in obtaining medicines for patients, the Association of the British Pharmaceutical Industry and the European Federation of Pharmaceutical Industries and Associations told the Financial Times.  gt;  gt; The ABPI and the EFPIA also called for proposed regulatory changes to medicines in Northern Ireland to be phased in over the course of a year, saying that just 15 weeks before Britain #8217;s full departure from the EU, the industry was still  #8220;in the dark #8221; about how they were to be implemented.  gt;  gt; Without further guidance from the UK government and European Commission on how the changes will work in practice, medicines may not be able to be legally dispensed in Northern Ireland from January 1, the trade bodies said.  gt;  gt; Richard Torbett, ABPI chief executive, said it was  #8220;absolutely inexplicable a mutual recognition agreement for medicines has not been prioritised and cleared up already #8221; by UK and EU negotiators.  gt;  gt; He described the changes as technical, involving neither side surrendering leverage during the negotiations on a trade deal.  gt;  gt; Mr Torbett also said medicine supply chains were already under strain from coronavirus. Failing to agree a mutual recognition agreement would risk introducing additional delay, complexity and cost.  gt;  gt;  #8220;That would be asking for trouble  #8212; and it beggars belief we are asking for trouble at a time when we have a global health crisis, #8221; he added.  gt;  gt; Under the Northern Ireland protocol, designed to avoid a hard border on the island of Ireland after the transition period, medicines there will be subject to EU rules but the regulations are to be enforced by a UK watchdog.  gt;  gt; The ABPI and the EFPIA said companies were still unclear how the EU rules will be interpreted and implemented, however, as they try to prepare for the end of the transition period and finalise their supply routes to Northern Ireland.  gt;  gt; Mr Torbett said that, for example, it was unclear whether medicines would have to be tested again after reaching Northern Ireland from the EU.  #8220;Those facilities don #8217;t exist in Northern Ireland and we #8217;re not clear at all how that would happen, #8221; he added.  gt;  gt; Nathalie Moll, the EFPIA director-general, said it was  #8220;imperative #8221; that the EU and UK negotiators agreed to both a mutual recognition agreement, and to the phasing in of the application of the Northern Ireland protocol to medicines.  gt;  gt; It added that, according to  #8220;our contingency plans, we have asked suppliers to stockpile at least six weeks #8217; worth of medicines, as part of a robust and flexible multi-layered approach #8221;.  gt;  gt; However, the ABPI said that, without a mutual recognition agreement, problems would continue long after the stockpile  #8212; which only covers the UK  #8212; had run out.  gt;  gt; Nor was it possible to stockpile every type of medicine, and current global demand for some treatments amid the Covid-19 crisis would only make this more difficult, it added.  gt;  gt; The ABPI and the EFPIA underlined the potential economic cost if no mutual agreement on medicines was negotiated, suggesting it would deal a blow to Europe #8217;s pre-eminence in life sciences.  gt;  gt; The additional complexity of doing business in the UK and the EU would  #8220;mean that investors begin to look elsewhere to set up new medicine research and manufacturing sites #8221;.  gt;  gt; The more the EU and UK diverged, the more the US and Asia would benefit, said the ABPI and the EFPIA.  gt;  gt; According to their calculations, a trade deal without a mutual recognition agreement would lower EU gross domestic product each year by  #8364;1.3bn compared with if one had been finalised. UK GDP would be  #8364;2.5bn lower each year.  gt;  gt; Pointing to the importance of the pharma industry to the post-Brexit UK economy, Mr Torbett said the country had been  #8220;one of the global #160;homes of the pharma industry for many years #8221;, generating exports worth about  #163;23bn a year.  gt;  gt;  #8220;We are one of the only sectors in the economy talking about growth, #8221; he added.</TEXT>

Quotas apply to fish species which cover the waters of multiple countries, and they are not "our fish" any more than the ISS belongs to us when it flies overhead. We can insist nobody crosses our border to catch them, but that's almost entirely meaningless. Our fishermen will still catch the same species in the same body of water and internationally-agreed quotas will be just as necessary as ever.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Great dismantling of a huge pile of tripe.  gt; Except that, contrary to the WA, this deal needs to be approved and ratified through all the different countries. Not just Council + EP, but also the Belgian Walloon devolved parliament for example. Hence the Oct. 15th deadline That's *mostly* correct. In fact, as with CETA, there are bits that can be provisionally applied before ratification. I believe that includes tariffs on goods. It's worth noting that even though it's possible for these things to be ratified quickly there is no guarantee it will - there are still 13 EU member states who have not ratified CETA, so some of it has not come into force yet. I think in the case of the EU-UK deal it would need to be officially declared a mixed deal and there may be no will to do that on the EU side, but it's certainly possible for them to do it.</TEXT>

Whether there is the will in the EU is a different question, and one we can only answer by asking it. Pretending it's some Herculean task is not helpful.

I'm well aware of that.  gt; You're trying to make a complex issue to appear simple, when in fact - it is not. It's pretty simple - again, by treaty standards. Bear in mind the WA already made provision for an extension, so the basic mechanisms are already signed off. Your argument is similar to Brexiter fantasy thinking. There's no reason to believe any of these countries are going to make the demands you have imagined, yet you are pretending they're some inevitable blockage to getting an extension done.  gt; If there is another extension - will the UK contribute to the EU budget? Obviously. If you're going to argue with people about an extension to the WA, you should probably take the time to read the bit of the WA that covers an extension, otherwise you'll make yourself look a right plum.</TEXT>

    <TEXT> gt; So everyone that earns less than  #163;25k gets a pile of free money. But if you dare earn over this amount you don't No, the tax would be progressive. So it's more like if you earn  #163;0k you get the full UBI (call it  #163;5k for an example). If you earn  #163;8k, you get a  #163;5k UBI added on and the free allowance is  #163;10k, so you get taxed at the low rate on  #163;3k. If you earn  #163;25k, you get  #163;30k and get taxed on the low rate for  #163;20k. If you were on  #163;25k, that very rough outline would see you better off by  #163;4k per year. In fact, the tax brackets and amounts would change. You'd probably be better off under UBI if you were earning under somewhere between 30k and 40k, and worse off above that.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Full text to avoid the horrible ads: Oscar Wilde once claimed:  #8220;I never travel without my diary. One should always have something sensational to read in the train. #8221; My thread headers are, I must admit, less riveting than that. Still, they have their moments. Three years ago, I wrote about the UKIP leadership contest to replace Paul Nuttall. The candidates formed a crew that one is compelled to describe as motley. One candidate sought to mine the asteroids, while another was a survivalist who had once been shocked by a gay donkey that had sought to rape his horse. We don #8217;t get enough moments like that in politics.  gt; Where are UKIP now? And, just as interestingly, where are the kipperati?  gt;  gt; For UKIP, it #8217;s been an eventful period. Since August 2017 they #8217;ve had seven different leaders (four permanent, three interim) and a period of two months with no leader at all. All four of the permanent leaders in that time have either left or been suspended from the party. The last permanent leader, Freddy Vachha, disputes the validity of his own suspension. The current interim leader is Neil Hamilton, who should at least be able to empathise with those at loggerheads with their party establishment.  gt;  gt; This turbulence does not seem to have helped UKIP. It received 0.1% of the vote share nationwide in last December #8217;s general election, 22,817 votes. This is fewer than UKIP #8217;s last recorded membership total (29,000 in April 2019).  gt;  gt; It appears that just two of the eleven candidates who stood for the UKIP leadership remain in the party (Ben Walker, who is now chairman, and Marion Mason). One, David Allen, appears to have left active politics although he still enthusiastically pushes Leave.EU messaging on social media and is a vehement lockdown sceptic.  gt;  gt; You might think that the other eight would have been scooped up by Nigel Farage #8217;s Brexit Party. After all, this has been the populist right vehicle of choice in the last eighteen months. But you would be wrong. Only Jane Collins is completely in the Brexit Party fold.  gt;  gt; Peter Whittle leads the Brexit Alliance Group. Anne-Marie Waters founded For Britain. John Rees-Evans founded Democrats  amp; Veterans. David Kurten has founded the Heritage Party. Henry Bolton founded Our Nation (though he is now an independent). Aidan Powlesland discovered the stars, his destiny in the Libertarian Party. Like a purple Velvet Underground, not many people may have aspired to lead UKIP, but it seems that everyone who did went on to form another party.  gt;  gt; We have not, of course, exhausted the parties of the populist right. David Coburn wandered through the Brexit Party, sought but was refused membership of the Conservatives and is currently snuggling in Alliance For Unity alongside George Galloway  #8211; a gruesome twosome if ever you saw one. If these choices do not tickle your palate, you can ponder the English Democrats in which a different David Allen is very active, Shneur Odze appears to have plumped for the Conservatives for now, while still clearly carrying a torch for Nigel Farage. Former MEP Patrick O #8217;Flynn fetched up in the SDP. Still more incongruously, another former MEP, Tim Aker, sat in the European Parliament for the Thurrock Independents for a while (he is now in the Brexit Party). In this packed field, Laurence Fox is launching yet another new party, provisionally named Reclaim, to reclaim British values from politicians. The uniqueness of this selling point in this section of the market is not obvious. Even the name has been half-inched. I was brought up in a non-conformist church and this kind of fissiparity is very familiar. It is also irrelevant to most of the outside world. Some historians of the seventeenth century have made careers out of investigating the internal workings of deservedly obscure Puritan groups in the Civil War period. The UKIP diaspora will similarly be a boon to PhD students in the future. I am not, however, anxiously awaiting the eruption of survivalists or asteroid-miners into the political mainstream any time soon. This ferment on the populist right does, however, tell us something. There remains a sizeable appetite for further populist change and this has not been quenched by Brexit. It has not yet found a coherent voice but that state of affairs may not last indefinitely. Nigel Farage hasn #8217;t gone away, you know. Since being dumped by LBC, he has continued to bang an anti-immigrant drum and many of his acolytes are among the most militant lockdown sceptics. While he has taken a detour to help launch a populist right financial service, Finance  amp; Freedom (other f words spring to mind), having learned how to influence government decision-making from the outside, he looks ready to pounce on any backsliding towards traditional conservatism by the government. So the government feels obliged to shore up its right flank, nonsensically prattling on about how the asylum system is broken even as asylum claims sharply drop, and is unable to be led by the science on Covid-19 because it turns out economic experts aren #8217;t the only ones that the populist right have had enough of. And, of course, it has to make a great parade of antagonising the EU, no matter how immediately self-defeating that might be. So the pressure of the populist right looks set to be an enduring force on British politics. In turn, that means that those who oppose populist positions cannot assume that they will win by default. The history of the last few years has been one of the establishment repeatedly losing by failing to oppose what it considers to be self-evidently stupid arguments. By that measure, Sir Keir Starmer has made a bad start as leader. He has spent a lot of time explaining what he is not and almost no time explaining what he is. With his broadcast this week calling on the government to introduce a circuit break, he finally seems to have made a start on that front. It #8217;s his first positive step. Time to tell the public what he stands for.</TEXT>

    <TEXT> gt; We are quickly getting to the point (assuming we're not there already) whereby the time it takes to set up an extension exceeds the time before which it is needed. The WA was far more complicated than an extension and that was signed by the EU and UK one week before it went into effect. We have quite a lot of time, and the amendment needed is relatively simple.  gt; it is now a much more arduous and time consuming task. It's harder, yes, but far from impossible in practice. Obviously the nearer the date the harder it gets, but at the moment it's still pretty easy.</TEXT>

That doesn't, however, change the mechanism for getting an extension agreed.  gt; It had also already written as Bojo only made small tweaks to what May had negotiated.

    <TEXT>If you think we should split quotas by geographical area, which is what you are suggesting, we will have half the quotas we have now. That's your position. If you disagree with that then you need to explain to yourself where you're going wrong.

    <TEXT> gt; If a house seller thinks the value of the house is 2M, and a potential buyer values it a 1M, and there is thus no deal, can the buyer blame the seller, or the other way around? I don't think so. If the buyer's family already lived in a house before the whole mess started, and the buyer sold it for a tin of beans while promising they could move into a much nicer new house, then the buyer will rightly be blamed for failing to deliver on his promises.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Well, let's break down the failures ... * The UK chose not to allow enough time for the negotiations. * The UK chose to pretend there wasn't a pandemic and carry on as though it wasn't happening. * The UK chose not to prepare competently for a no-deal exit. * The UK has known the EU's conditions for a trade deal for years and has chosen to pretend that we can force the EU to move on those conditions. * The UK has threatened time and again to walk away from negotiations. * The UK has gone back on its previous commitments, including the WA signed earlier this year. About the only thing you can say about the EU is "the EU hasn't dropped its red lines", which is true. However, there are two important things to note there. First, we haven't dropped our red lines either. And second, being the minnow in these negotiations, we aren't in a position to push the EU around.</TEXT>
