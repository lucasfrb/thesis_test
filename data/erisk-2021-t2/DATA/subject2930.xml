    <TEXT>This guide is based on #12304; #31354; #33639; #37202; #39302; #12305; #20803; #32032; #21453; #24212; #26426; #21046; #35762; #35299; [https://bbs.mihoyo.com/ys/article/2050152](https://bbs.mihoyo.com/ys/article/2050152) Translated by subject2930 #27704; #35433; #40372; Game Version: v1.0 Updated on: 19/10/2020 (v1.1) # 1.0 Elements In Teyvat, there are 7 types of elements: [Pyro, Hydro, Anemo, Electro, Dendro, Cryo, Geo](https://preview.redd.it/y5ufazq321u51.png?width=700 amp;format=png amp;auto=webp amp;s=343cb850b052b176e2ea22c84128db2ca65bc9ae) When different element meets each other, they create elemental reaction. # 2.0 Elemental Status When dealing elemental damage to a target, you can afflict Elemental Status onto the target. You can trigger elemental reaction if you deal a different elemental damage to the target that has Elemental Status on it. Elemental Status Gauge will either reduce over time or upon triggering Elemental Reaction (more details at below). When a character is affected by **Pyro** element, no damage will be done by **Pyro** Elemental Status existing alone. When a character is affected by **Cryo** element, movement speed is reduced. When a character is affected by **Hydro** element, Wet status will be afflicted. **Geo** element cannot be afflicted beforehand, it will only generates Elemental Shards after reacting with other elements. **Anemo** element will affect target with a very short interval when it hits the target. Therefore it is not used before other elements. When a character is affected by **Dendro** element, it will receive DoT damage. If it reacts with Pyro element, it will explode once and burn continuously for certain period of time. Certain elemental mobs and ores have their own element. Some of them cannot be removed/cleared. Example: **Anemo Hypostasis**, **Hydro Slime**, **Cryo Slime**. They are suspected to have the ability to continuously apply element on themselves. However, for **Pyro Slime** and **Electro** **Slime** will apply element on themselves with interval, therefore you will sometimes notice their elemental status will be exhausted. # 3.0 Elemental Reaction Elemental Reaction is divided into 4 main categories: **Damage Increase**: Vaporize, Melt **Additional Damage**: Overload, Superconduct, Electro-charge, Shatter, Swirl **Shield**: Crystallize **Others**: Burn, Frozen ## 3.1 [Damage Increase] Reaction Types: Vaporize, Melt Effect: Increase damage dealt directly Damage Multiplier: Original damage x (100% + Bonus Factor) Note: 1. Bonus Factor - additional damage from elemental reaction 2. Bonus factor will change depends on the order of an element is applied. 3. This damage depends on Attack Value, able to crit, bonus elemental damage (eg. Artifact #8217;s main stat and set effect),  #8220;Increase \[Elemental Reaction\] by xx% #8221; effect from Artifacts and Elemental Mastery of the Character who triggers elemental reaction (Vaporize and Melt) ## 3.1.1 Bonus Factor When **Hydro** element meets **Pyro** element, **Vaporize** effect occurs. When the reaction occurs, it will reduce the durability of the former elemental status. Bonus Factor is higher when Vaporize is triggered by using **Hydro** element on target inflicted by **Pyro** element status. When Vaporize is triggered by **Hydro** element, bonus factor is 100%. (2x of original damage) When Vaporize is triggered by **Pyro** element, bonus factor is 50% (1.5x of original damage) When **Pyro** element meets **Cryo** element, **Melt** effect occurs. When the reaction occurs, it will remove the former elemental status (Reduce the former Elemental Status Gauge to 0). Bonus Factor is higher when Melt is triggered by using **Pyro** element on target inflicted by **Cryo** element status. When Melt is triggered by **Pyro** element, bonus factor is 100%. (2x of original damage) When Melt is triggered by **Cryo** element, bonus factor is 50% (1.5x of original damage) Bonus Factor includes values mentioned above and Artifacts (eg. 4-Piece Set effect from Crimson Witch of Flames) Example: When 4 pieces of Crimson Witch of Flames are equipped, Bonus Factor for Vaporize triggered by **Hydro** will become 115% and triggered by **Pyro** will become 65%. https://preview.redd.it/fy8v33vg21u51.jpg?width=200 amp;format=pjpg amp;auto=webp amp;s=3ec5f1fe950ff74d495b9d54f42b5bfa506b8fd6 ## 3.2 [Additional Damage] Reaction Types: Overload, Superconduct, Electro-charge, Shatter, Swirl Effect: Deal additional damage when elemental reaction occurs Damage Multiplier: Fixed damage depends on the character who triggered elemental reaction Note: 1. Does not affected by attack value, cannot crit 2. Does not affected by level discrepancy 3. Does not affected by target #8217;s DEF 4. No damage difference between characters (same level character will deal the same amount of damage) 5. Affected by target #8217;s Elemental Resistance Damage dealt with Additional Damage reaction is only affected by stats that increase damage for respective Elemental Reaction eg. Elemental Mastery and Artifacts set effect. (eg. Thunder Fury and Crimson Witch of Flames. Respective reduce elemental resistance effect can increase the damage of Additional Damage reaction as well. (eg. Viridescent Venerer) https://preview.redd.it/ymfjkhhi21u51.jpg?width=600 amp;format=pjpg amp;auto=webp amp;s=33fb3aa84a27f983904f03bfa8c93dd5997d8e17 ## 3.2.1 Overload When **Pyro** element meets **Electro** element, **Overload** reaction occurs, creates an explosion and deal **Pyro** AoE elemental damage. Effect: 1. Explosion created from **Overload** can largely reduce the durability of the shield from **Geo** element objects and mobs (eg. Stormterror). It is also effective on reducing the durability of **Geo** shield. When **Overload** is triggered by **Electro** element on target inflicted by **Pyro** Elemental Status, **Pyro** Elemental Status Gauge will reduce by small amount. (After Elemental Reaction occurs, **Pyro** Elemental Status will remain for a short period) When **Overload** is triggered by **Pyro** element on target inflicted by **Electro** Elemental Status, **Electro** Elemental Status Gauge will reduce by large amount. (After Elemental Reaction occurs, **Electro** Elemental Status will be removed) ## 3.2.2 Superconduct When Electro element meets **Cryo** element, **Superconduct** reaction occurs, deals a **Cryo** AoE elemental damage. Effect: Target affected by **Superconduct** effect will have its physical DEF reduced by 40% for 10 seconds When **Superconduct** is triggered by **Electro** element on target inflicted by **Cryo** Elemental Status, **Cryo** Elemental Status Gauge will reduce by small amount. (After Elemental Reaction occurs, **Cryo** Elemental Status will remain for a short period) When **Superconduct** is triggered by **Cryo** element on target inflicted by **Electro** Elemental Status, **Electro** Elemental Status Gauge will reduce by large amount. (After Elemental Reaction occurs, **Electro** Elemental Status will be removed) ## 3.2.3 Electro-charge When **Electro** element meets **Hydro** element, **Electro-charge** reaction occurs, deals a single targeted **Electro** elemental damage. Effect: 1. Target will receive damage once upon **Electro-charge** reaction occurs and a second time later while also discharge it to one target around affected by **Hydro** elemental status. 2. Paralyze is applied and it is possible to continuously trigger the reaction to apply continuous paralyze debuff on the target. When **Electro-charge** is triggered by **Hydro** element on target inflicted by **Electro** Elemental Status, **Electro** Elemental Status Gauge will reduce by small amount. (After Elemental Reaction occurs, **Electro** Elemental Status will remain for a short period) When **Electro-charge** is triggered by **Electro** element on target inflicted by **Hydro** Elemental Status, **Hydro** Elemental Status Gauge will reduce by large amount. (After Elemental Reaction occurs, **Hydro** Elemental Status will be removed) When on/in the water, electricity will continue to be remained on the water and continuously inflict damage (to both allies and foes). Note: There is bug regarding on **Electro-charge** and will be (hopefully) fixed in v1.1. ## 3.2.5 Swirl When **Anemo** element meets **Pyro/Hydro/Cryo/Electro** elements, **Swirl** effect occurs, deal additional elemental damage. Effect: 1. Element infused in the **Swirl** can be spread to targets around, and can cause elemental reaction with other different elements. 2. When a character is inflicted by certain type of element, the element can be spread and cause **Swirl** effect with the element infused. Since the Elemental Status of **Anemo** element exhausts very fast, it is not recommended to use it beforehand of other elements. Only when Elemental Status Gauge reached a certain level, the element can be infused with **Swirl** and spread out. (eg. 3 second after Mona normal hit, although the target has **Hydro** elemental status, the **Hydro** element cannot be infused and spread with **Swirl**.) Elemental damage dealt by the element infused in **Swirl** is depending on the Elemental Mastery of the caster of **Anemo** elemental skills. With  #8220;Viridescent Venerer #8221; Artifacts, you can reduce the Elemental Resistance of the targets hit. https://preview.redd.it/9112p29w21u51.jpg?width=200 amp;format=pjpg amp;auto=webp amp;s=11bb2aa22f0a24890692f8fcda403cfa5f0f6ab5 ## 3.2.6 Shatter Different from other Elemental Reaction, this effect occurs when a frozen target get hit by Claymore attack or **Geo** elemental damage. It will deal an extra single target physical damage, usually use along with **Superconduct** that reduce physical DEF of the target. Elemental Reaction are supposed to be coexist with each other. However during actual combat, Shatter is not coexist with other elemental reaction. When a target is frozen, under most circumstances: 1. **Diluc #8217;s** elemental skill can only trigger **Melt** effect 2. **Beidou #8217;s** elemental skill can only trigger **Superconduct** effect ## 3.2.7 Summary for Additional Damage type Elemental Reaction [ Character who used to trigger Elemental Reaction: Lv80, 0 Elemental Mastery; Target: Hilichurl \(10% all elemental resistance\)](https://preview.redd.it/2jnznfcz21u51.png?width=957 amp;format=png amp;auto=webp amp;s=ee7fdd891a17f8c33c7611eb573ad6f3a8bb6170) **Overload** is clearly the strongest AoE damage from Additional Damage type elemental reaction you can get so far, but since it always create explosion that blow targets away, it should always be used along with mob gathering skills (eg. Venti #8217;s Elemental Burst). While the damage ratio of **Electro-charge** effect is only 2.4, due to its special mechanism of dealing two times **Electro** damage, the true value should be 4.8 (2.4x2). Since the interval CD of triggering **Electro-charge** is the lowest and reduction of the gauge of Elemental Status is low if **Hydro** element is used to trigger **Electro-charge** effect, it is possible to frequently trigger this elemental reaction to deal huge amount of damage. Thus, highest single target elemental reaction damage. Damage dealt with Additional Damage Elemental Reaction on different level (lvl1 to 80), Please refer: [https://bbs.mihoyo.com/ys/article/2215872](https://bbs.mihoyo.com/ys/article/2215872) (Will replace with English version once it is done) ## 3.3 Crystallize **Crystallize** effect occurs when **Geo** element damage hit target inflicted by **Pyro/Hydro/Cryo/Electro** element. (**Crystallize** can only occurs upon triggering with other element) After triggering **Crystallize**, it will generate Elemental Shards, and remove the target #8217;s elemental status. Effect: 1. Elemental Shield will break after absorbs certain about of damage. 2. It can absorb 150% corresponding elemental damage and 250% for **Geo** elemental damage. Elemental Shield durability is depending on Character #8217;s level that triggered the Elemental Reaction, Elemental Mastery and Shield Strength increment from Artifact (eg. Retracing Bolide). It does not depend on Character #8217;s HP and DEF. https://preview.redd.it/f3plgghi31u51.jpg?width=200 amp;format=pjpg amp;auto=webp amp;s=93c6401a8c2352fca3558d515b1f4744b7563842 ## 3.4 Other Elemental Reaction ## 3.4.1 Burn When **Dendro** element meets **Pyro** element, **Burn** effect occurs, deal continuous burning damage. **Burn** effect will continue until Elemental Status of **Dendro** element is exhausted. When **Burn** effect is triggered on Character, one physical damage is received and receive continuous burning damage. Reference:  #12304;v1.0 #25915; #30053; #12305; #33609; #20803; #32032; #19982; #29123; #28903; #21453; #24212; #65288; #26356; #26032; #65289; {\[v1.0\] Dendro Element and Burn Elemental Reaction} [https://bbs.mihoyo.com/ys/article/2104938](https://bbs.mihoyo.com/ys/article/2104938) (Will replace with English version if requested) ## 3.4.2 Frozen When **Hydro** element meets **Cryo** element, **Frozen** effect occurs, freeze target for 6 seconds (approximately). However if the target is frozen again within a short period, freeze duration will be reduced, but not less than 50% or 3 seconds (approximately). **Frozen** effect will inflict **Cryo** Elemental Status. **Frozen** is only a debuff that prevents the target from moving, it does not change the damage received by the target. # 4.0 Elemental Status Gauge on Additional Damage reaction Elemental Status Gauge will reduce over time or upon triggering Elemental Reaction. Total amount of the gauge and duration of the Elemental Status are different for each element, skills from Characters and target. (Ruin Guard has lower Elemental Status Gauge compared to Hilichurl) Example: 1. **Razor #8217;s** Elemental Skill is used to inflict **Electro** elemental status, **Barbara** is used to trigger Elemental Reaction, **Electro-charge** can be triggered **THRICE**. 2. **Keqing #8217;s** Elemental Skill is used to inflict **Electro** Elemental Status, **Barbara** is used to trigger Elemental Reaction, **Electro-charge** can be triggered **TWICE** only. Conclusion: Razor #8217;s Elemental Skill has higher amount of Elemental Status Gauge than Keqing #8217;s Elemental Skill. ## 4.1 Reduction of Gauge of Elemental Status ## 4.1.1 Overload 1. When **Overload** is triggered by **Pyro** element, **Electro** Elemental Status Gauge will reduce by **LARGE** amount and **Electro** Elemental Status will be removed. 2. When **Overload** is triggered by **Electro** element, **Pyro** Elemental Status Gauge will reduce by **SMALL** amount and **Electro** Elemental Status will remain for a short period. **Overload** can be triggered again during this period. (This is still debatable for now, but based on my small experiment and Chinese community, Overload cannot be trigger for the second time.)  #8203; ## 4.1.2 Superconduct 1. When **Superconduct** is triggered by **Cryo** element, **Electro** Elemental Status Gauge will reduce by large amount and **Electro** Elemental Status will be removed. 2. When **Superconduct** is triggered by **Electro** element, **Cryo** Elemental Status Gauge will reduce by small amount and Cryo Elemental Status will remain for a short period. **Superconduct** can be triggered again during this period. ## 4.1.3 Electro-charge 1. When **Electro-charge** is triggered by **Electro** element, **Hydro** Elemental Status Gauge will reduce by **LARGE** amount and usually an extra **Electro-charge** can be triggered. 2. When **Electro-charge** is triggered by **Hydro** element, **Electro** Elemental Status Gauge will reduce by **SMALL** amount and both **Hydro** and **Electro** Elemental Status are remained. During this period, 2 - 4 times of **Electro-charge** can be triggered. Concluding that **Electro-charge** reduce Elemental Status Gauge by the least among all elements. ## 4.1.4 Swirl, Shatter, Crystallize Since they are only triggered on specific elements, Elemental Status are reduced by large amount and removed upon trigger. However, **Anemo** element can spread other elements through **Swirl** effect. ## 4.1.5 Summary https://preview.redd.it/5in5y1a341u51.png?width=1030 amp;format=png amp;auto=webp amp;s=0fac17d81ba61b431b4af511cd115151231227f0 ## 4.2 Theory of Elemental Reaction Coexistence Elemental Reaction occurs according to certain priority order. If an Elemental Reaction is triggered and the remaining Elemental Status Gauge is enough to trigger another Elemental Reaction once more, we call it Multi Elemental Reaction. However, if Elemental Status Gauge is only sufficient to trigger one Elemental Reaction, Elemental Reaction with higher priority will occur. **Priority order: Damage Increase  gt; Additional Damage  gt; Crystallize** Examples: 1. **Diluc** dealing **Pyro** elemental damage on **Frozen** target will trigger **Melt** Elemental Reaction first. If Elemental Status Gauge is still sufficient, **Shatter** Elemental Reaction will occur next. 2. **Beidou** dealing **Electro** elemental damage on **Frozen** target will trigger **Superconduct** Elemental Reaction first. If Elemental Status Gauge is still sufficient, **Shatter** Elemental Reaction will occur next. 3. **Ningguang #8217;s** normal attack (**Geo** element) will trigger **Shatter** Elemental Reaction first. However, if the Elemental Status Gauge is insufficient to trigger **Shatter** Elemental Reaction, **Crystallize** Elemental Reaction occurs. 4. **Bennett** dealing **Pyro** element damage on a target with both **Wet** and **Electro** Elemental Status will trigger **Vaporize** first. If Elemental Status is still sufficient, **Overload** Elemental Reaction will occur next. # 5.0 Elemental Conversion on Normal/Charged Attack **Pyro  gt; Cryo  gt; Electro** Testing Character: Bennett, Diluc, Keqing, Chongyun 1. Within **Chongyun #8217;s** field, when **Diluc #8217;s** Elemental Burst is used, **Diluc** deals **Pyro** element normal attack. 2. Within **Bennett #8217;s** field, when **Chongyun #8217;s** Elemental Skill is used, Character inside both field will deal **Pyro** element normal attack. 3. Within **Chongyun #8217;s** field, when **Keqing #8217;s** Elemental Skill is used, **Keqing** deals **Cryo** element normal attack. 4. Within **Bennett #8217;s** field, when **Keqing #8217;s** Elemental Skill is used, **Keqing** deals **Pyro** element normal attack. # 6.0 Elemental Shield In Genshin Impact, there are two kinds of shield: Damage Resistance Shield and Damage Reduction Shield. ## 6.1 Elemental Advantage against Damage Resistance Shield (Abyss Mage) https://preview.redd.it/tmagfupa41u51.png?width=754 amp;format=png amp;auto=webp amp;s=23fd4a17640e863e48c7469f1d1f2a52a4695749 ## 6.2 Elemental Advantage against Damage Reduction Shield (Fatui Skirmisher) https://preview.redd.it/3p4j0hya41u51.png?width=898 amp;format=png amp;auto=webp amp;s=d09caabcb01d1c27633b184a6bd992f27fa8cc63 To show and prove Electro element is faster than Cryo+Pyro combo against Hydro Damage Reduction Shield. Please refer: [https://www.bilibili.com/video/BV13p4y1Y7wP?zw](https://www.bilibili.com/video/BV13p4y1Y7wP?zw) # 7.0 Summary All Elemental Reaction damages depend on **Elementary Mastery** of the **Character** who triggered the reaction. **\[Damage Increase\] reaction** directly increase damage dealt, depending on Character #8217;s attack, bonus elemental damage (eg. Artifact #8217;s main stat and set effect),  #8220;Increase \[Elemental Reaction\] by xx% #8221; effect from Artifacts, Elemental Mastery and can be crit. **\[Additional Damage\] reaction** damage is based on a fixed value affiliated to the Character level who triggered the reaction. Independent from Character #8217;s attack, level discrepancy, target #8217;s DEF and cannot be crit. Dependent on target #8217;s Elemental Resistance and receive  #8220;Increase \[Elemental Reaction\] by xx% #8221; effect from Artifacts. **Overload** deals highest AoE damage. **Electro-charge** deals highest single target damage.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Conclusion I can make for the time being, based on chinese comment and my test (Razor's elemental skill and Amber's charge att/ Fischl's Elemental skill and Amber's charge att) on Hirichurl, order doesnt matter, both of the gauges/element icons will disappeared upon reaction. There is a rare scenario where pyro/electro gauge will remains (flickering) but you cannot trigger elemental reaction. Will update this on the post</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Yes, you are right. It is like a sort of value applied to the mobs (example, some skill apply 40 and some apply 80) and they will reduce over time until it is gone. Since we don't have any data about it, the tester just try with different skills to come out with reduce by SMALL and LARGE, instead of a specific value</TEXT>

    <TEXT>There is still a lot of debates going on choosing elemental mastery and attack. I recently saw someone actually going Elementary Mastery on their "Watch" artifact on Diluc, and the result is also quite promising. But since it is just the start of the game, there is a lot of unexplored fact yet. But so far, the higher your WR is, the lower the psychical damage is, so elemental mastery may actually the way to go. So maybe next time even our main dps may have to build up elemental mastery. Tips: 4-pieces Instructor Set is a very good artifact that can boost whole team Elemental Mastery by 120 upon triggering elemental reaction.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Overload deals pyro damage, but will never apply pyro. Have to definitely test this out if Oz's electro damage will hit every mobs in the tornado and will overloading two or more mobs will deal 2x or more damage. Nonetheless it should be dealing more overall damage than using hydro tornado+electro combo since explosion deals AoE damage</TEXT>
