    <DATE>2020-06-02 01:40:47</DATE>
    <TEXT>Hewwo peeps! Literally everyone's been making creative posts one way or the other. But, i would not like to make any creative post or something. What am gonna do is, show the true self of PokeMeow to everyone, via this subreddit. Guys, u all know, PokeMeow definitely is a small bot, BUT ITS ONE OF DA BEST bots, like fr i mean it. The Dev, Gopi, is all so considerate about the updates of the bot. The staff, so communicative, so nice. The co-owner, she's been helping Gopi with updates, without any greed or selfishness. The community of PokeMeow, so clean, with no toxicity. The gameplay of the bot, its so simple,yet it is so powerful.Trust me guys, its worth it to recommend all your friends to play this bot, because this is the only way we can appreciate and give something to Gopi and niceperson and the entire staff for their hardwork and selfless work on the bot!! Cheers everyone!! Cheers Gopi! Cheers Niceperson! Cheers Staff! ILY ALL!!!</TEXT>

    <TITLE>My Try XD #reddit-giveaway</TITLE>
    <DATE>2020-06-12 04:47:49</DATE>
    <TEXT>Alright guys, so i finally decided to make a giveaway entry, not sure if you all are gonna like it or not. Lets see, i hope you enjoy!. Day starts, following the usual routine, X woke up, Went to his bathroom, along with his phone, searched for his brush, to clean the phone's screen, went under shower, with his phone in a plastic case, then went to the kitchen, to feed electricity to his phone. Then, opened discord, went to a lush green city called "PokeMeow Official". Now, this was when things started heating up. In an exhibition called "#global-rare-spawns", Y, A staff member of the city, obtained a Shiny Rayquaza. As soon as the 40 People, who reacted on the capture saw it, they all ran to a battlefield called "#trading" to try and obtain the Shiny Rayquaza. Now, X noticed as well, and he wanted to obtain it real bad as well. Then what, all Swordsmen, With their swords, called "PokeCoins", went to the battlefield, to try and get the Shiny Rayquaza. Poor Y, got spam pinged, and............  #8203;  #8203;  #8203; Y's Dream broke. Story ends, Cya!!  #129315; #129315; #129315; #129315;</TEXT>

    <DATE>2020-07-31 15:36:55</DATE>
    <TEXT>Greetings. I been playing pokemeow for while. I had some frustration and good moments as well. All belong in every game we play, especially when it comes RNG games. When the clan feature came out I was really exicted but sadly those moments ended pretty fast. We all know about the lag, it was understandable and Gopi did really amazing job fixing it . But I'm not here to talk about this. I used to be I'm a small clan grinding on my own. Sometimes chatting with the clan members. But I felt I didn't belong there. Most players where only chilling and I was number 1 with 5k only being 3 day old . Trying at least to be top 10 with that clan. We succeeded for while but lost it later on, I was pretty much upset with some clan mates. But instead of sending bad vibes towards them (after all was more a hangout clan), I talked to one friend. Who opened up a door to a top clan in leaderboard/highscores in catches. I was so hyped that I passed my whole night catches and breaking my own limits. They where really good moments. Everyone had a purpose to grind. But afterwhile everything changed. It all began with one member who said some silly joke in Official server, instead of getting a warning, was a straight foward a ban from OS. Everyone was mentioning about OBLV and some of their members being promoted in OS. It began to feel I was playing a unfair competition. Where anyone could join OBLV and be good grinder/player, promotions was a easy task to get. Then others situations happened were we had some members frustrated because Promos of "Happy Bday Gopi" being short duration and didn't manage to get the Golden pokemon. This Made another member do a silly mistake and get a straight ban (Not a mute nor warning). Our leaders of the clan started begging "If you are frustrated, talk about it in here. Don't talk in OS". This fear started becoming the daily reality. If I talk to OS, I have a high risk of getting a ban? Next day, with a cool head I started talking in OS. At least trying to show we aren't bad or idiot players. I talked as the usual me, help where I could and make some jokes (Trying not being offensive or clan related), just to cheer up the people. And there was one moment I made a joke about my sister using "hacks" (Being way more lucky in pokemeow than me) and one admin replied "Give me her ID and Im going to ban her". It was clearly following a joke. But back then I felt fear. After all our competitors where a clan where the majority are admins and mods inside. Anything, even a slight a mistake. I might get banned because I use this clan tag. I made one tough decision during my experiences of pokemeow, I apologized to everyone and left the clan. Nowadays I play as solo player. Not thinking about joining any clan. I started to realise why most games don't have the admin/Game master as playable, but more like sentients and checking situations/reports. I'm not here asking the admins/mods to stop playing. After all they are veterans. The thing is, OBLV has majority of admins and mods inside. And I believe the situations before used to be dealt with a mute or warning, lately I only hear "that person got ban" over and over again. All the powers are centralized by only one clan and I had very unpleasant experiences playing against them. Lucky I didn't get a ban nor warning from the administration team. But I clearly also avoided talking in OS. I really don't want to imagine when the day comes. At least I'm safe...? What about my friends? I want to tell what I felt during my clan experiences. They weren't the best experiences and somehow I'm slowly giving up pokemeow. Even nowadays the bot is super fast and the lag issue is only from my side (sometimes). I don't represent any clan. Is just my experiences about the clan feature. From my point of view, some stuff should change. Thank you for reading this and I hope u understand.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>mann i really hope so that this happens. but at the end it all depends on pokemon company. i was reading a fansite called "matome" by translating and it said "sad news, queen pokegirl serena is confined to xy only" and i was sad after reading it but then i got to know it was a fan site so info cant be considered legit but still i had some doubts in mind after reading that.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>ik this is a amourshipping page, but guys, i have been thinking about this. like, zygarde said i need greninja's help to remove all the negative energy from kalos, so once all that energy has been removed, greninja wouldnt be that helpful to zygarde anymore, so could this mean greninja might return? imagine serena and greninja coming together to kanto in the upcoming episodes? that'd be great too. i think this theory is a lil bit good isnt it?</TEXT>

    <TEXT>yeah the theory is dope except the lastt if that happens they'll either remove ash as main protagonist and switch to goh(highly impossible) or just finish the anime completely, and i dont want any of those to happen. i just want serena to be his permanent travel companion, and this time ash giving him signs of his crush on her, that'd be really great to watch lmao</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Not really, cuz before dp, there wasnt any confirmation of "a lot of old characters will return", which is not the case with journeys, where we were actually informed that a lot of old characters are gonna appear. Secondly, goh and ash are visiting every region, so its a lot more likely for them to come across their old friends. Thirdly, we all know Serena is one of the most popular pokegirl, followed by misty and dawn(i think dawn and misty are quite popular aswell), so serena will be the most likely to return. Also, hajima, the director of xy and xyz(not sure if i wrote the name correctly), said in an interview that they were not a couple, but they'll probably become one in the future. Thats how he ended xyz, after their kiss</TEXT>

    <TITLE>Question:</TITLE>
    <DATE>2020-09-05 07:49:38</DATE>
    <TEXT>guys i cant help but wonder. u know, all the pokegirls have had a connection to the one in the next series. like, the pokegirl of one region gets to know the pokegirl of the next region in the next series.. for example, misty knows may, may knows dawn, dawn knows iris, and alola gang knows misty again. but theres no connection between serena and other pokegirls (iirc). this could be a mere coincidence, or perhaps could mean something in the future? idk, what do u all think?</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Any kind of at this point, as long as its amourshipping (ofcourse). I mean, just the kind everyone likes, no sad endings, etc etc. Although i do prefer if they become a couple around halfway through the story and not at the end. There are certain stories like lights of laverre and heartbeat which werent that lengthy, but were pretty good. I'd prefer those kinda stories too as long as they have a nice plot u know.</TEXT>
