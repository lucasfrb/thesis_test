Also, it would be cool if they are games I can play and compete with my friends. They can be single player games as well though. I like games such as: Getting Over It, Minecraft, Among Us, ELWG, Risk, Clash Royale, Chess/Chess Variations, Agar.io and etc. I also like games like poke #8217;mmo, it brought out a competitive incentive and was playable with my friends, it was really immersive and enjoyable. I had it on my note 10+ but when I switched over I wasn #8217;t able to download it due to compatibility.</TEXT>

It #8217;s because it #8217;s the objective the the game you fucking retard. there is a difference between what me and you are talking about. Im talking grown men who are sexually attracted to a fictional characters that are catered to look like minors or really young children. You know why that is? It #8217;s because they are attracted to the characteristics of a real child. Also, people like that tend to end up doing stuff like that, sort of like a gateway drug. Either way people like that deserve to get stomped out and beat up.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Maybe gateway drug wasn #8217;t the right words to use. What I meant to say is someone that likes characters due to them being just like little children is of course going to like real little children. There #8217;s a difference between playing a video game and being sexually attracted to kids. Also, not once have I told someone to die. You guys are just little bitches who can #8217;t handle the truth. Not only that, I #8217;ve been in the anime community for years and have hundreds of anime #8217;s that I #8217;ve completed. I don #8217;t just come to subs to attack people. I made one comment and people want to downvote like their lives depends on it because I called them out.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Being stomped out has never been used to convey killing someone. Also, I mentioned how if you like anime girls and have crushes on them as a grown man the you #8217;re a weirdo and perverted and when I said liked and crush it was to be used to describe intimate feelings. People began to say it #8217;s okay to like them as in a intimate way and it #8217;s okay to have kinks to those types of stuff. Also it was also directed to not just this thread but to a vast amount in the comment section. I #8217;ve been in the anime community long enough to know how sick minded some of the people are and it #8217;s really disgusting to know that people support it.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I told them that anyone who is sexually attracted to fictional characters due to the design that #8217;s made to resemble a little child or minor is gross, disgusting and a pedophile. People got mad at that and mass down voted me.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Nah, I was never trying to say it like that. All I meant was that if you got sexual desires or yearn for a intimate relationship with characters resembling minors then that #8217;s completely wrong. It #8217;s okay to like a character due to their personality and just them as a character. But it #8217;s very wrong if you #8217;re a grown man or woman who looks at characters like that as sexually attractive or desirable. When I went to an anime convention last year there was this group of pedo #8217;s who had a booth to discuss loli characters and stuff like that. Those are the type of people I hate.</TEXT>

    <TITLE>Dedicated Stylus For iPhone???</TITLE>
    <DATE>2020-10-16 18:09:13</DATE>
    <TEXT>Hello, I just wanted to ask what people would think about an iPhone having a dedicated stylus like the Samsung Note line. I use both the the 11 Pro Max and the Note 20 Ultra and while I really like the iPhone I #8217;ve always wondered why they wouldn #8217;t or haven #8217;t added their own version of a stylus yet. I don #8217;t always use the s pen in my Note 20 but when I do it can be pretty useful, especially for writing, drawing and filling out documents. It also has some other uses such as being used as a controller for the camera or to be used to preform gestures. I #8217;ve been thinking about it for awhile now and I really think that it could appeal to a large amount of iPhone users, while not only would it make work related documents and etc. easier to work with. It could also just be used for drawing/art and could just overall be a handy tool built into an iPhone. Anyways I was just wondering about other #8217;s thoughts on this subject and if people would like to see something like this happen.</TEXT>
