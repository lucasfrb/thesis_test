What does it feel like getting skinned? " and then you look at the comments and everyone is either a.

    <TEXT>First of all yes im 13, 2. Pretty sure buffolo lake is closed and if you can damn well find me a place to hike then go for it, last time i checked texas was flat but sure.. Ive never seen fish anywhere else but buffalo lake which.. Oh its closed.. Farmers market... The perfect place right now to go if you want covid! Oh yea let me go to a fucking Broadway shows and touring events with hundreds of people there also why am i going to go watch a sports game when the stadiums have thousands of people in them? On a side note the phrase "speaking of which" is used when somethings related to the other thing in anyway. Im pretty sure there is no hiking college team in lubbock All of the shit you just said is either 1 perfect way to spread sars 2 isnt open And lastly doesnt work in 2020 When i said there was really nothing to do here is right now in the present joyland is closed pretty sure your "mesumes" are closed too But then again you find joy in trying to make others feel bad on the internet If you have something against what i just said above you couldve started this convo with this "I think you meant joyland because theres no funland lol" or something like that instead of starting with WeLl FiRsT oF aLl</TEXT>

Then the police start mocking and bullying him "hey wake up it's time for school!" And once the paramedics got there the officers got up and said " aw jeez I hope I didn't kill him haha" And they were charged but the charges fell and 1 month after they were back on the force</TEXT>

For example a fast pace song I want to try to learn is megolovania and when I try to use sustain i can barely distinguish any note Also side question: what will happen if I use the damper and sustain at the same time? And what's the middle pedal do?</TEXT>

There are already gore sites sprinkled everywhere on the surface web, aswell as the fact that eyeblech mainly uses only gore pics, there are a bunch of gore sites that have videos of men being slaughtered which is way less tame then the photos. Not to mention that eyeblech has a bunch of rules to protect against super bad gore (ie: no animal cruelty and cp) AND theres a pinned convo at the very beginning that's a warning to people that they could've been tricked into blech instead of bleach, aswell as what they may find on the subreddit Give me a legit reason it should be banned and we can debate</TEXT>

And lastly 3. Well yes but actually no, it was a parody of bleaches name. eyebleach=good eyeblech= gore and bad, But the name was twisted by trolls to trick others, which is why it's mainly hated, but the community hates this, I myself made the subreddit to deter people from linking, and mods disapprove of it aswell. Hooks is a mod at eyeblech and my subreddit aswell so you can ask him.</TEXT>

See? She says for him to learn from his mistakes, but the internet isnt going to learn to forgive him, hes going to end up with nothing. If she didnt want a witch hunt then she shouldn't have made the shit public with still wanting to love him and support him, So tell me.. how's fed gonna make a living for himself now? Most places aren't gonna accept him and he will have to stream again, but oh, the internet hates him... no subs, no donations, and then it's all downhill.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Okay so what ima bought to describe to you might just put you in more of a bad situation and I'm a guy instead of girl soo Bottle up all emotions, weeks or even months of sadness, and get more depressed, just stop smiling for anything unless you want to hide behind a mask to help even more for below Then wait for the opportunity that your mom calls you something again, or hits you or does the blanket shit again, bawl, release all of the emotion, tell them how they make you feel, bawling. This will in turn make you parents think of how they treat you and therefore will be better from then on. I did something similar ( just the bottling up part aswell as the depression) and parents haven't done anything fucked up to me in a while so As for your grandma, be nice and just go with the flow of what she does, "its c chord? Ok how do I do that one" Ask for her help that inconveniences her as much as she inconveniences you. Looks like she just wants to pass more info to you by teaching you</TEXT>

      <TEXT>Hey buddy, I'm talking 60 pond mutt who lives in an alley and feeds on dumpster food being approached by people who want to put it in a dog pound, If theres a baby there shouldn't be a 100 pound dog who will attack anything it sees as a threat to its owners or home I have a pit and he doesn't do shit, the most of how he could hurt us is accidentally scratching us or jumping on us, but he doesn't do that with my neice, with my neice he'll just run around and lick her forehead, which we tell him no to as that's gross. If a dog is raised the right way it should never want to be overly protective and kill a child or person for territory. If a dog had abusive owners and no one was nice to him do you think hes all of a sudden gonna change when people approach him trying to lock him up in a cage at a dog pound? These dogs should always be treated like a loaded gun, if you dont and you get killed or hurt by it that's on you for being reckless with a 80 POUND BEAST TF DID YOU EXPECT. These are guard dogs fit to protect a home and people with its life, these are bred to be big and strong to assert dominance and threat, they are also bred to have big strong teeth on a killer jaw, If the dog hurts someone unexpectedly then yes it should be put down for not understanding society, if it does why must you ban them? Put down if bad, raise right and dont put down if treated right</TEXT>

      <TEXT>Nope, use the head and shoulders *everyday* until you cant get flakes anymore using a lice comb, but be very careful if you do use a lice comb to get ut out as you can scratch your scalp with it and make it worse, Oh I should mention Dont scratch your scalp, if you itch course your hand through the hair BUT never ever scratch the scalp Using the head and shoulders let that soak into your scalp, get it lathered put it in your hair , and get the hair wet for about a second then just keep on scrubbing not with your nails tho, Mines gone already and above is what I did</TEXT>

No one talk me out of this. idfc anymore that my brother will find my body, why should I? They're all annoying, I want everything to be quiet for good, no one will bother me if I'm dead, so please, are there any suicide methods that wont make a mess and wont be painful? I'm too much of a bitch to go through any pain, I want something painless, so I cant bitch out, Please, just please, please give me something here, I just really need to know for when I had enough of everyones shit before I off myself It's going to be a last resort I promise, just tell me, I just need to know, please.</TEXT>

I think your body's bottling such strong feelings in trying to stay emotionally stable. But that wont be good in the long run. If you bottle this up your gonna get really stressed out like I do. And eventually if you keep it bottled up your gonna get really teary and sad for everything bad that happens to you. I already experienced this My aunt died when I was 8 and I didnt know how to grief. Now I'm stuck here knowing that I'll never get to see her again and see her face one last time.

      <TEXT>Have a magical skelly that uses rune magic and enchantments to curse player, or attack. Seeking arrows, unless you add a rune skelly that enchants hit arrows ti seek a target but even then it would follow you till last few seconds for a chance (this means that the arrows can be avoided yet it will be a nuisance with many of them, think the shulkurs spell bombs but arrows instead) Zombie golems are no no. Instead Should zombies be able to kill the village golem. They will bring out their stone golem that has the same health as player 20/20 but it has same strength as iron golem , will break down doors in one tap, And Has twice your speed so theres no running away from this thing, its head to head combat and you better hope you brought a shield. Undead mods should be only be revived if they aren't taken down with critical hits to the head (its weak point any other area only does half damage.) Skellys keep 60 block range, it is doubled if they are in a higher placement than you. (Basically Vietnam snipers) 50 enderman is no no, instead once an enderman reaches half health it screams loudly with an animations (screaming bloody murder animation) And 2 other half health weaker enderman join the fight (these enderman are also same height as player. They are children enderman. Blaze does an animation and blows up with members going everywhere to start flames. If a 2nd villager sees you murder a villager it will shriek and notify the village golem. The enderdragon doesn't kill you It plays around with you until you take down all its Crystal's and deal the first blow. Now it will try to throw you around, slit fireballs at you. And leech your life away It will do this by throwing a ball at you. And if it happens to surround you with its area damage, you will be leeched of your life. Slowly with no way to recover. Your items, should you pass will be found by a bandit merchant who will snooze through your items and put them all in a chest, you have 30 minutes to find him next to your death area and fight him, in order to fight him you have to charge at him with sword in hand, he will then fight you dealing 1.5 hearts per hit. Shall you beat him you get your items back hooray! What's that you didnt have a spare sword? Then you must buy back your items that he will sell. Most likely, with iron or gold (new purpose for gold too!)</TEXT>

      <TEXT>He sleeps in the cage but it's not locked at all and there door to the cage is always open unless were putting in trailers and want him out of the way so he doesnt hurt himself. The cage is basically where his bed water and food are, the whole backyard is always open to him. He is guard dog for home We were robbed few years back through the window to the back of the house in my room and that's why we have him aswell as to have a bigger dog for outside who is hyper active and would like to play all the time besides my little dog who is care free and sits like an egg till *she* wants to go outside lmao</TEXT>

I get night walks but you cant be surprised when the guard dog doesnt like his territory being surrounded when hes trying to sleep Neighbors are old too, like old old, I remember that one time I took the shih tzu to the corner of house to pee and an old man is looking at me through window and tells me "what are you doing!" I wanted to say nunya gramps but I just said I was walking the dog</TEXT>

      <TEXT>Since I have a story with fireworks I will tell it since there was no camera. So we set up everything and have already popped 3 fireworks time for a cool one, I'm givin the honor of lighting it and placing it So there were 3 shots in this bad boy and I lit and ran, 1st one goes off good, The canister flips over and aims at another truck and fires, they were fine and it completely missed them However shockwave sends it back our way, It shoots its last one and I get hit with a ball of gunpowder to my gut, felt like a really small and strong baby punching me, then it hits and falls to ground, Step dad knows what's coming and turns away, I was turning around to see what had hit me, Then 3 2 1 BAM! and it exploded right in my ear, I went deaf for a second, You know how in the movies and games they make it like EEEEE when you get hit with a stun or flash grenade? Its not exaggerated at all! I couldn't hear and it sounded like I had tinnitus for a minute Everything was muffled and once it calmed down I checked my gut, I had a really bad burn, want to say 2nd degree but it was more like a really bad 1st degree, it was black and irritated. Luckily there was ice and I used that to treat it Story time over!</TEXT>

This is why booby traps are not allowed in your house because you should only have to serve your time. This same kind of crop happened to a couple who put a shotgun boobytrap In their house and a robber got his leg taken away and for years had pain, He won the lawsuit against them So no, not good, if any thing this should be like something that its plastic barbs and there's a puzzle on the bottom and you have ot do it or it stays on and you go to a hospital and arrest you there, Enough to incapacitate someone but should be able to be easily removed by a medical professional to cause less damage You don't shoot someone in the dik, you don't take a man's dik from him, that's just not right What if your kitty had a big impale on it from when you try to do something and can't have children?</TEXT>

Hang in there, Think of someone who you would bawl your eyes out for if they unexpectedly died OK now reverse the roles, That's what I just thought of with my mom. The journeys going to be rough, but give yourself a purpose in life, whether it be playing video games, working, or even volunteering to work at a place where its trashy and clean it up It might not get better, but if you can give yourself a reason to live, then you'll make it out just fine. The universe is made up of a long dead stars ashes, The universe is letting you have these atoms of the ashes from that star, its *your* turn, Are you really going to give away your turn early? After your turn there's nothing, no noise, no fun, no emptiness, no fullness So why give away your turn when your 20 when you can give it back to the universe at 80?</TEXT>

      <TEXT>Get yourself a moderate priced one, Don't lowball glasses, because they *will* fall off your head abd be too tight and suck, they're cheap for a reason, Don't go to expensive, I mean these will be on your face 19 hours of the day Get a pair that will look good in all occasions, for me thats black and silver, but it may be different for your wardrobe/ tastes Glasses are like goldilocks, you want it just right, of course it has to be comfortable and sit tightly on your face, but not too tight, Make sure to wash your nose pad, it will get all green from some concoction of oils, dirt, and dead skin off your face, so wash it every week, maby even every other day if you can, had it happen to me since I didn't know much about glasses, yucky. Lastly dont be those type of people to try and postpone the death of your frames with wire or crap, it looks ugly, Take care of them, and wipe lens off when there's stuff on them, if you screw up and get some sort of oil on them it will be a tough time to get it off the lens, it will just spread out, so be mindful with that. And lastly have fun! These are your first tryouts to see what you like! Wide ones? Circles? Old man style? Maby even these red ones here!</TEXT>

Doesn't matter if op is having a fantasy or not, you dont guilt trip people with family or friends because you don't even know what they're going through, another rule on one of the biggest suicidal communitys on reddit, is to know whats ops cause.</TEXT>

      <TEXT>One way you could reduce trauma is by not doing it at all, hence the whole bullshit above, your kids care about you, don't give up on life just yet, wait till it gets better, your gonna hurt your kids no matter what, if you kill yourself they will be sad and wonder what triggered it in the future, causing them to get depressed thinking they were at fault, your dammed if you do, dammed if you dont, but being dammed if you dont will be better, cause there's a chance life will get better</TEXT>

      <TEXT>And you really think killing yourself will make it better man? Its not, I know I sound like a brat who hasn't experienced the real world but dude, maby become independent and you don't need anyone. Your gonna kill yourself simply because you can't get your life together? Your gonna kill yourself simply because everyone threw you away? Well guess what, you can get your life together, and you have kids who won't give up on you because your there dad.</TEXT>

      <TEXT>So, if i remember correctly, 2 Portales can be made up to 16 blocks from each other and they will have the same end destination , and the more and more block difference you have, the different end location off of it, Thats also why people make nether plazas with nether portals on each side and blue ice boats to get there, they're traveling 200 blocks to the next nether portal and getting farther out</TEXT>

      <TEXT>If they can all do the same job, then why send more than necessary, the obvious answer is to get many things done faster, but why do they need to get multiple things done fast? Is it to maintain the ship? Then boom, without the 10 crewmates they can't fully maintain pollus or skeld and will lose either way</TEXT>
