    <TEXT>I am quite confused about the dating event and the celestial ball. Is it true that if I don't choose the same person for both, I will lost my relationship with the one I chose first? And I can't find any information about what are all the options for the dating event and the celestial ball. Can someone help me out to see things clear?</TEXT>

As I see developers do everything they can to slow down the main story, but to be honest I don't want to be in the last finished chapter of year 6 soon. My priorities are TLSQ-s, then events, then main story classes, then side quests, then main story. Except if I need a duelling spell or house points from the story. Events are actually good for collecting attribute points.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Some years ago I said to someone that I wrote this novel because I would have read a book like this but it hadn't existed yet. (sorry for the terrible grammar) When later I mentioned this to someone, he said that it's kind of egoistic to say that. But this is the truth!

He always became really nervous when he had to read something out loud because each syllable came very slowly. Everyone (including me) thought that he was dumb, but I guess the teachers were the real dumbasses because no one ever said that he might had a bad dyslexia. Maybe this kid is similar, but he has some kind of dysmagia.</TEXT>

And I don't think that our daily coin income increases as we go to higher years. I have the Babbling Spell too, but actually I don't dare to use it, because I'm afraid that I won't get the large stun.

    <TEXT>I've done the  gt;!cart robbing mission with Micah just yesterday, and there came a lot of O'Driscolls, like 15 and Arthur and Micah just killed all of them.! lt; It would be so tragic if the Van Der Linde Gang would meet two pro gunslingers and all of them would die. But in games it works like this, the life of our character and his friends are more valuable than the life of hundreds of people we kill during missions. We don't see their friends and families and dogs, so we feel no empathy towards them. Since I like Kieran, I often think of him when I kill O'Driscolls and I always hope that I don't get someone like him in front of my gun. It's probably stupid but this is how I think.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>If I compare it to offline, it has no "soul", it's world is not as rich as in offline. But you have a lot of opportunity to improve your character, because of the roles. In offline, you collect a lot of money early on the game, but here you have to fight for dollars and gold bars which I like. Clothes are not as good as in offline in my opinion, but you can have up to 10 horses. Getting perfect pelts is not so important, there's is no trapper, you can't expand the capacity of your satchel and there are not so much animals. I like offline a lot better, but online is often more exciting, it makes my heart beat faster when I take part in an event for example. I hope this helps you to decide.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Brave horses are also prey animals, but bonding gives them some extra bravery. I can image that a level 1 war horse also whines if you bring him close to predators. My level 4 online shire lets wolves so close to him that they could easily bite him but when I let him stand there for like 5+ sec, he bucked me off. It was the only time when he did that though. And there's definetely a difference among breeds too, even if it's small. In offline I go everywhere with 2 horses, and I see that my appaloosas and paints are more skittish around alligators than my shire.</TEXT>

    <DATE>2020-05-26 01:10:14</DATE>
    <TEXT>1st when I cleared out a gang hideout in New Austin. When I started to loot the bodies, I may touched something on the ground and I just flight and flight up in the air and then fell down. 2nd when I was bringing a bounty to Thumbleweed. Before I could step on that covered wooden bridge, I got blowned up. Without flying this time. No players were in the area and I didn't see NPCs neither. 3rd when I was standing at the sheriff's office with the bounty, waiting for the timer. I exploded again, this time I had to revive my horse and my bounty died. Has anyone experienced something similar today? Is this a glitch or probably just some invisible player was messing with me?</TEXT>

    <TEXT>It can be fun, and looting enemies gives things like chewing gums and antique alcohol bottles. I get max 10 dollar and like 0.24 gold for a bounty, but I'm only at level 4, it's not my favourite role to be honest. You go to a place, wait for the bounty, and you try not to kill him/her only the others. Or you kidnap them from a wagon, that's it. Legendary bounties are more fun, once I caught one in a posse when I wasn't even a bounty hunter.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>No problem. My favourite is collector, because I like to collect things in the game. I bought it some days ago, it wasn't even a week, and already maxed out. Now I have access to thoose fancy max level criollos and I jumped like 20 ranks since I have this role. Now I'm rank 50. Plus you can sell collections for good prices, and I figured out that I should only sell a collection, if I got a bonus for it, like this week for tarot cards. This way you can get even 400+ dollars for a collection.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I also have problems with PVP. I play 3 weeks ago and I won some railroad barons and a king of the castle, but my killing numbers are hilariously low. I feel like I can't aim that little point as fast on the heads as other players do it on me, even if I play in freeaim lobbies. I like fist fights better. But I keep taking part in events and I feel some slow improvement. I recently bought the split point pamflet and my shots are more accurate with split points than with express. I've done some research on guns recently, you need some great guns for PVP. A great repeater, a great revolver and a great shotgun are my priorities.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>It would be nice to get access to locations and activities step by step as we're improving, like in story mode. When you first try online, you're just dropped into this big world with all these unknown icons on the map, without any clue what to do. And despite that at the beginning you don't have anything just a scrawny nag and a cattleman revolver, you can still take part in all of the events. King of the castle was so traumatising for me as a complete newbie to this game and to PvP, that I stopped trying to get to know this online world and went back to story mode for weeks.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I feel really hopeless and useless recently. I have really bad anxiety. I should find a work like others in my age but I'm not good enough to do any kind of work with other people. Especially not that kind work what I studied for. I just got my diploma but I'm afraid I won't ever be able to use it. I have no goals in my life but I really should work, and my parents also don't like that I'm at home, but to be honest I'm scared. I don't want to be this person that I am, I always make a fool of myself, and I don't want others to see me like this. I just want to go back in time. Never wanted to be an adult. Is it normal with BPD? Is it okay to feel this way? If it won't go away I will do something to not see this person in the mirror again. If not this year, then in ten years.

    <TEXT>When I started playing this game, I used to take part in almost every events. Pvp events were truly challanging for me, but then I ranked up, now I'm close to 100, and I see a lot of 30 gt; players on events, like 75%. There are some rank 100/200+ players too, but if I win, it doesn't feel as good as it felt when I was a lower-level myself. Could it be that I was placed onto a beginner's server because I'm a beginner in pvp, or the game just puts me into groups of beginners? Or higher level players keep leaving the game and is it so significant? Any idea?</TEXT>

I went so far with this strategy that I even started online, and it hasn't felt good to be dropped in New Austin that I haven't even see in story mode yet... So delusorio.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I've recently bought the semi-automatic but my favourite is volcanic for PvE. Semi-automatic eats a lot of bullets, its damage is very little, and it's not very accurate. I don't know if I'm not accurate enough with it or it couldn't kill enemies with one headshot but definitely not my style. Volcanic is accurate and powerful.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>So this is my first game with PvP and I like to take part in events but it happens too often that I became real angry if I get killed. I'm that guy who doesn't shoot unless gets shot at, but I know that dying is part of the game, and I want to improve my PvP skills. I'm quite nervous during agressive events, my heart is pounding like crazy, so do you have any advice/experience how to stay cool-headed during PvP?</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I also felt quite lost when I started online. For Cripps I only hunt deers, they have high value. My camp is in Scarlett Meadows and I find enough deers without searching for them. Pelts almost aren't worth anything, even if they are from a perfect moose or bear. About deliveries: it's not really worth to do long distance deliveries because they take a long time and other players can attack you. When you'll have enough money, you should buy a medium and then a large delivery wagon to get more money and xp for deliveries. Hunting wagon is also a great investment later, it can store up to 5 large carcasses and you can call and dismiss it, so you don't have to travel from the hunting location to the camp with it. To not feel lost, I recommend you to do dailies while you're improving your trading business and the rest will come.</TEXT>

    <TITLE>How could this guy explode a bounty off my shoulder during manhunt?</TITLE>
    <DATE>2020-06-30 01:34:58</DATE>
    <TEXT>There was one more bounty than players and I caught that bounty and someone's run into me with their horse intentionally and I fell, my horse needed reviving, but I couldn't drop my bounty off because two players were after it, so I called another horse, but before it's arrived, someone made a little explosion, so I fell again, my cores were unharmed, but my bounty died and this guy stole my bounty. What the hell. Is this okay to do this? I can't see how he could explode me like this, while both he and the other player were very close to me at this moment. Also, as I'm not very experienced in manhunt, I can't see if it was just some healthy fight or players are dicks during manhunt, because they've stolen my bounty and my horse before.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Now that's really a dick move. Once I met a guy who really played this in co-op spirit, he had a bounty on his horse while I was struggling with a bounty on the ground and getting shot by NPC-s, and he lassoed this bounty and told me on his mic to get him.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Yeah, it was not a smart step from Rockstar. On my first manhunts I went with some other player to catch a bounty together but it sucks that either you have to defend the other one or he defends you, but only one of you can bring in the bounty. It also sucks that you can die only once. But I like day of reckoning, even if it's a bit strange and buggy.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Is it usual if players come to your camp that you can't donate to Cripps because the donation menu is empty? Also, is it normal that I couldn't hurt the two players who came here to steal my 3-star deer that I couldn't donate? My camp was in defensive, maybe that's why or some modding?</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I know, I've already maxed out the roles, but I couldn't donate it from my shoulder because I haven't seen my things in Cripps' materials menu, only the empty black background-squares, I haven't met a glitch like this before. This is why I put it on the ground. Now I see that I haven't explained the situation quite clearly in my comment. But after these players have left, the menu was back to normal. Anyway, thank you for the explanation, now I know that it's normal that you can't attack a player in/from your camp.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>A girlfriend is not just someone who you're emotionally attracted to, like an animal, a girlfriend also gives emotional support, serotonine to your brain and a meaning in the life of a man. I have some friends around 30 without a girlfriend and in this age they can really feel useless if they don't have a partner. I've even heard about a suicide that happened because of this. So men really do need a partner to be a better version of themselves.</TEXT>

People like these pedophile hunters with these actions basically just yelling that "he's an evil! It's not me! I'm an angel, I'm a hero, you see the contrast?" They forget that everyone is just a human and as Norvegian prisons confirm, therapy and rehabilitation can help criminals to be an useful member of the society again.

    <TEXT>This must be quite a difficult journey. I've heard that you have to feed the fresh hatched birds in every 10 minutes and you can't make the tiniest mistake or they will most likely die, but it's also a luck if they hatch. I think it's a miracle that a big mammal like us could even raise a bird from an egg that is smaller than a phalange. I don't think I'd be able to do this (maybe with chickens one day haha) but I've heard that you can ask the breeder for a young bird who can easily be hand tamed/was hand raised but doesn't require so much attention as a baby bird. I plan to get a bird like this. But I'm sure your hand raised bird will stay tame. You payed a price for this while raising him. Do you know the channel A chick called Albert by the way? That man raised quite some birds, and as a bird-lover, his videos melt my heart.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>It's so strange that they don't need food on the first day. Maybe their digestion system is not ready yet? I mentioned that attention thing becase I'm not sure how old that bird was, I just heard about this from an acquaintance. It must've been very young but not a baby. If you say one hour, I believe that. I wrote that 10 minute because I saw this in a video from this Albert channel, but that bird was not a finch but some wild black bird species that this man saved. The eggs were finch-sized, but different breeds probably require different feeding frequency.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Getting out of a reinforced lasso is a long and boring process on keyboard, like 20-30 sec, players usually kill me or let me free before I could break out, so I don't use the give up function. But it can be useful if they're attacking your trader or moonshine wagon, then you can give up, parley and save your wagon. Or when someone is uninterested in fight/wants to be somewhere else.</TEXT>

He and his posse leader were waiting for every bounties at the seriff's office with dynamite arrows, so I wanted to avoid their trap. When they couldn't catch me, they shut down my internet connection before I've reached the office.

    <TEXT>You should do dailies then and buy a role, and cash will come. I remember it was a harsh change in prices from story mode to online, but then you realize that you have enough opportunities to get money. As long as you don't have a role, fishing big or middle sized fish can be a source of money, and king of the castle or railroad baron give you like 15-20 dollars, or horse race is another option. You can start to collect things for the collector role with the jeanropke map. I don't know what is your rank but don't forget that you get treasure maps after every 5 rank which means a lot of maps on the first rungs of the ladder. And you don't have to buy food from the store, you can save money by looting houses for food or roasting meat. I hope this helps.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>True words. It seems every attacker checks your rank before action, because I haven't seen any lassos after like rank 50. Otherwise 80% of the people I met are nice or neutral, maybe I'm just lucky. But don't be surprised if a modder just spawns where you're at and starts beating/shooting you, because that's how things work on PC. And there are some people who like to keep their blip red and attack you because of that. Be careful with gang hideouts, I got killed almost every time by someone when we started clearing it at the same time or when I wanted to help as a beginner. People like to do everything alone.</TEXT>

I feel poor if I compare myself to you all but I invested a great amount of cash into 10 horses + saddles and a nice wardrobe of clothes. I also have like 6 of each collections if I'd quickly need some more money.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Well I'm super happy right now. My favourite game gets a big update! And it has something to do with nature which is also good news. I'm confused about panthers because it seems English only uses this word for black panthers but they're dark brown in the game, so they must be Florida panthers, but only the black panther has a spotted, yellow variant which is called jaguar and they surely haven't been part of the game yet, am I right? A new big cat and probably a new location is coming!</TEXT>

My metal detector is always out whenever I go, I'm collecting when I'm waiting for an event or a bounty timer, the jeanropke map is always opened on my phone and I always do the collector dailies. It's great to fill out empty time or to discover some places you've never been.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>The Harry Pottet series was a wonder for me too when I read it in my middle school-high school years. I even reread it 3-4 times, played almost every HP games, I know almost every lines from the movies and I still have a sweet spot for this complex and lovely world J. K. Rowling has created. And I was born in the year the Philosophers' Stone was published haha. Now it's not my priority but I recently play Hogwarts Mystery on android which is a story of a random student (you) who attended Hogwarts before Harry did. So it's not the same but a high quality game, it's worth to give it a try if you don't want to leave the magical world soon. Can I ask you why the series were banned in your country?</TEXT>

    <TEXT>It's an unsaid role to not hold your guns/lasso in your hand when you're approaching a player, and also move slowly, don't run towards them, because they easily can think you're about to attack them. Another thing that players usually don't like if you go close to their horse, because they don't trust you. The same is valid if you see someone delivering a moonshine/trader wagon, they can think you want to destroy their mission. Until like rank 70, players often will throw a lasso at you, but after that it magically stops, and you will rarely meet some griefers. That's it I guess. Happy trails to you!</TEXT>

    <TEXT>1 - collector and trader are the best roles if you ask me, collector is really peaceful and brings a nice income ($140-$540 for complete sets), trader too. You have to do some resupply missions but these npc-s you fight against are pretty weak. If you can't aim at their head, two bullets of a navy if enough for them. Otherwise it's just hunting, and when you have the large delivery wagon, you get $500 for a local delivery. At first do your deliveries in defensive and only local ones, because players can get a notification on the map of your long delivery and can attack you. 3 - if a horse dies, you can bring it out of the stable for free or pay $4 and wait 2 minutes for it to come. And you can buy a brush in the catalogue. 9 - the stuff from outlaw passes are only available for a period of time.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I'm rank 210+, but I still have more bad- than good-aim-days. I feel like I can't move my lower arm as precisely as it's needed for thoose headshots. On my bad days I need like 2+ seconds to shoot an npc in the head while standing still. I experimented with mouse options earlier, and felt some improvement some months later but I recently had a break and find myself humiliated in pvp again. Can't even see the little point on the screen if I stand face to face with someone aiming at me. Any advice?</TEXT>

    <TEXT>It's 63 in Hungary, and it will be raised to 65 in 2022. Why do they not let the old people rest for god's sake?! Their health and skills are not as good as they were when they were young, they can be dangerous for others and themselves if they drive a car, and there are many younger people who can't find a job. I see myself retiring at the age of 80 if I live so long.</TEXT>

I don't say they shouldn't drive at all, they are not dumb either, but it's not right that old people still have to work and drive in the morning rush to their workplace. My 80-year old grandpa still drives to the shop and to the pharmacy, he's fresh in the brain and really careful, but as we're aging, we become slower and it's better to help and protect old people than see them still working as a robot above 60 in my opinion. They should have a choice if they want to resume their job at a certain age or want to stop and rest.</TEXT>

Because of this I memorized the starting times of events from 8 pm to 3 am when I usually played, but like 2 months ago the whole system got messed up. Then events got another update and now we only get naturalist events.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>This is so true. I recently went through a phase when I hated my bass too. A year ago I joined a rockband because I wanted to play in a band and no other bands searched for bassist in my area. The last time I liked rock music I was 14, and since then I'm more like a groovey type, so it was a mistake. I needed some time to realize that I hate to play thoose boring basslines that our songs had, and travelling once every week to that city for practice sessions started to become a pain in the ass. I lost my connection to my bass in that time, and I haven't touched it for months after I quitted the band. It was a journey to find the feeling which I felt when I was learning my first songs on bass, but I eventually got there. Since then I'm enjoying my bass again. Glad that you're also back on track, keep it up man.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Yeah, players usually just want to kill you the fastest possible way, which means that they stop your game for a moment and teleport you to somewhere further. Spontaneous pvp is not fun. Once I met two guys, they were doing a fistfight. I was observing them, and when one of them won, I chose the yeehaw emote and he answered with a friendly emote and the other guy came back and they continued fighting and I joined, and we were doing this for like 15 minutes and after this we did some stupid things with coaches and flammable moonshine and dynamites and we just enjoyed ourselves. But it all ended when one of them was just standing, and the other one stood beside him and put there a dinamite and whistled for me so I also stood there. It was an epic moment but the explosion was so big that I found myself in a seperate lobby after this. I didn't even check their names, probably won't find them again.</TEXT>
