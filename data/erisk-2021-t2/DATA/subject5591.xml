    <TEXT>I will try to answer your questions in order... 1. Drop rates are the same for A+ through F Those rates are all 0.0001% to get anything other than mana, crappy runes, and low essences... 2. Skillups will add to your overall damage. The skillups are more or less depending on how that monster is balanced against others of its kind. All skillups are not equal, but most are based off of the same percentages we typically see (i.e. +10% damage) 3. Yes there has been extensive research on the world boss... The results are as you would expect... RNG is a B*TCH and you will get crap for the crap time you spend building your crappy mons... Good Luck and Happy Hunting!</TEXT>

I said making a 2-3* mon to a 6* mon... For example taking a wind yeti (2*) to 6* in the course of 1-3 days is not difficult. Faimon drops enough fodder for this.</TEXT>

    <DATE>2016-10-12 10:10:48</DATE>
    <TEXT>So I played a bit of Magic about 12-15 years ago and I was thinking of jumping back in... I have no cards (sold them all so I could eat in college), limited funds (wife and 3 kids), but lots of time to devise decks (desk job). Do I need to invest in a lot to get started or can I jump in without much upfront investment? I have no issue buying once I am knee deep into it again, but I am currently trying to figure out if I can "catch the bug" again without having to dive in the deep end with money. Any advice?</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I agree that growth will help with the deficit and the interest rates, but regulations on big businesses will slow that down. We have been going through increased regulations in the banks, the auto industry, energy (though I agree with most), healthcare, etc. I want smaller government involvement and I think that will help drive business growth. Businesses are fleeing the country for better options because of taxes and regulations. Healthcare might be my biggest issue right behind Climate Change. The ACA has been great for people to be insured, but the system is still broken. Healthcare is still run by the insurance payers and they are holding people hostage. Healthcare needs to focus on quality and access. Insurance payers are going out of their way to make it harder for people to access care. Hospital systems need to adapt too, but the margins are so small that they can not properly invest in the future needs. The payers make sure of that. The troops are still over there fighting in countries that dont even want our help anymore. We continue to spread our resources too thin across too many countries because we are the first to jump in to help. Bring them home and lets secure our allies first and then jump into humanitarian aid. Sorry these are out of order from my previous post and your response, but I lumped a few together as you can see.</TEXT>

Could that be the reason my weight loss has stalled? I am no biologist, but I am willing to try to make any change I need to. Can you suggest a different sweetener for my morning (and sometimes afternoon), coffee?</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I don't track my calories very strictly because I eat very simply. Chicken, very little bacon, lettuce, and coffee... I am not someone that needs a ton of variety, but rather simple and quick meals because of my schedule. Also, yes I use the packets of Splenda.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Today I was having my regular check in with my boss and she dropped the bomb... "We have some serious concerns." Nothing any of you can do to help, but I just needed to share with someone. I have been seeing a therapist for this and the changes are very slow to come. I feel like I need to fix myself overnight to save this. How do people sit down and write powerpoints and presentations and project plans? I want to gouge my eyes out when I try to do anything like that. I marvel at my type A colleagues that sit down and produce these long documents full of details that I can't read, let alone create. I have been very lucky to get to where I am. I have always been great at what I do and mistakes have often been glossed over because of talent. I have always had great team members that have taken my ideas and put them down on paper and plans to move things along. Now I am in a job that needs more detail and I am struggling. Now my mistakes are $100,000+ mistakes. I did explain that I am working on it, but really at this point in the game, I might have dug the hole too deep. TL;DR: I have missed follow up on some big items. I haven't been able to complete project plans in a timely manner and now my reputation and possibly my entire career is at risk.</TEXT>

A new box opened up about 2 miles from my house and I signed up for the Foundations classes. I am so excited and nervous about getting back into it! Wish me luck!!!</TEXT>

    <TITLE>Pre-Visit Visits?</TITLE>
    <DATE>2017-09-20 13:09:09</DATE>
    <TEXT>Hello, We have been struggling to get this off the ground. Essentially we want to have a 15 minute visit with an MA/RN to get the rooming process, med reconciliation, and safety questions out of the way before the "actual" visit with the provider starts. It would ideally look like this... 745a-8a appointment with MA 8a-830a appointment with Physician 815a-830a appointment with MA 830a-9a appointment with Physician 845a-9a appointment with MA 9a-930a appointment with Physician and so on... The issue we run into is the "overbooking" in the schedule that screws up data collection and creates double work since we now have to schedule two appointments instead of just one. Does anyone have any experience with this type of scheduling? Thanks in advance for any help!</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I find the issue is the same either way. I could schedule patients for 45 minutes, but still run into the issue that the appointments cross into each other. This is specifically for a Diabetes, but the logic stands for any other practice. We have patients that need their pump downloaded prior to the visit with the provider. We would like to eliminate the need for our call reminder system to simply say "Please come 15 minutes early." In turn, we would prefer to have the reminder call say "Your appointment is at 745am." We find that patients will be on time for their appointments and not alway come early. I just want time for the MA/RN to prepare the patient for the provider so that all of the prework is done before the provider walks into the room. Whether that happens in two separate visits or all in the same I don't care. But one the times start crossing, our "Fill Rate" report goes right out the window.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Unfortunately no. There were and are better third basemen than Wright throughout his career, so you can't even make the "he was the best in his era" argument. Beltre, Rolen, Chipper, Zimmerman, and more have more impressive numbers. I'm sure I'm missing a few others. Do we include A-Rod here? I'm not sure.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I agree that the argument isn't the ideal, but it is the truth. All players are first benchmarked against the players of their era. This first pass at evaluation does leave some, but not many in the cold. I think that most deserving HOFers get in over time. We can also have the discussion about the "era" in which he started his career. Him and Reyes put up amazing numbers while there were known steroid users still playing in the league. That, I think, only hurts his chances more. The real truth of the matter is that Wright just wasn't a premier third basemen for enough years to warrant a HOF nod.</TEXT>

I would even guess we would be ok with a gutting of the team with a solid plan in place, such as what Houston did, the Cubs did, Cleveland did, Detroit is doing, and so many other examples.

    <TEXT>Well this answer is most likely not the complete answer. You might be seeing a locum tenen, which is a doctor that is contracted out to cover the practice while they recruit another full time Physician. I work in healthcare and we do hire locum tenens to bridge the gap of the loss of a Physician and hiring a new one. This happens more often in rural communities that struggle to attract physicians to the area, but does happen in more metropolitan areas as well. You might also be seeing a rotation based practice. Some groups rotate physicians for coverage reasons as well. This is rare, but it happens. Primary Care is in a severe shortage of physicians for some of the reasons above, but that is certainly not the entire answer. That being said, there is a shortage of physicians throughout the country and the trends are not improving. Fellowships across the country are not being filled and this is putting more and more stress on the system. Reform to healthcare would go a long way to bringing talented people back into the profession. Hope this helps!</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Do you work in healthcare? Do you know how any of this works?? Physicians have a thankless job, like many of those who choose a profession of service and caregiving. Please do not speak for all of those that have given their lives and careers to the profession. I have had the opportunity to work for and with some amazing physicians and caregivers and can tell you that despite the constant changes and increasing expectations, they still love caring for people and helping people improve their health and wellbeing. Quality measures are put into place so that you know what type of facility and provider will be caring for you. Quality measures help people live longer healthier lives. Yes, those measures take extra time to enter into the computer system, but these are measures that haven't been collected in "the good old days" when physicians couldn't compile data at a macro level to help eliminate disease and illness. Quality measures help us cure complex disease like cancer. If you prefer to move to a country that doesn't measure quality data and doesn't work towards curing diseases and doesn't care about improving the health of everyone in the country, then you will have to find somewhere else to live. This is the reality of medicine. Embrace your increasing longevity and start saving your pennies for your retirement... It's going to be a long one!</TEXT>

    <TEXT>MBA for sure. Having any type of business background will help you in any business, but the lack of MBAs in healthcare, that are not in the Accounting and Finance Departments is depressing. We need more business savvy people in healthcare. There are MBAs with focuses in healthcare, project management, finance, etc. pick one that fits and go for it. I work in healthcare, have my bachelors in accounting and my MBA. I work in Operations and both help me every day. Good luck!</TEXT>

    <TEXT>These folks manage people that tend to have needs in a very acute way. To the previous poster #8217;s point, most of these patients are behavioral health patients, patients that are distressed in some capacity, or have other social issues that, if the need arises, need to be dealt with quickly and safely.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Oftentimes it #8217;s social work type activities, like calling authorities to help. This might be a situation of a suicidal patient that has an event and the case worker would contact social work, police, etc. to help the individual. There is a connection to the hospital because most of these patients show up in the emergency department (ED) after an event in their lives. This isn #8217;t limited to mental health patients. This could apply to patients or families in abusive relationships or situations as well. Case workers would be called when, for example, a mom and her children show up to the ED with obvious signs of abuse. These folks carry an emotionally heavy load. They deal with situations most of us can #8217;t even imagine.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Well your comment is simply not true. We teach all our physicians to be  #8220;insurance blind, #8221; which means they treat the patient and the problem in a medically necessary manner no matter the insurance, or lack there of. We ask for your information so that we can avoid fraud, avoid unnecessary bills to patients, and to ensure that the insurance payer pays for your care. Hospitals give millions of dollars of free care and write offs for patients that can not pay for their care. If you think there was no clinical reason for something your provider ordered, than ask for the reasoning and feel free to question the need, but don #8217;t assume they are ordering unnecessary tests unless you ask some questions first.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>You bring up an excellent point about price transparency. The charge master is a terrible measure of true cost to the patient. Oftentimes the charge master is inflated to the highest amount any insurer will pay. The average reimbursement for a charge from the hospital is 45-50% of the actual charge. It #8217;s a game that is played between insurers and hospitals. If the hospital bills below reimbursement, then they are leaving money on he table, so they have to charge high amounts to get the best reimbursement from the top payers. Total cost of care is no longer only the price the hospital pays to care for you, it also includes loss of time from work, opportunity costs incurred, anguish, etc.</TEXT>

You make an excellent point of all the talent we brought up through our farm system. I just think that the Yankees players are producing better. Thor and DeGrom are legit. Conforto and Nimmo are close. But let #8217;s not pretend all those other names are studs just waiting to break out. Also, if we had a high end farm system we would have better chances to go get some other high end players via trade. We don #8217;t have the pieces in the system to go get anyone. Great farm systems are used to bolster the major league team and help get free agents. A  #8220;top 10 #8221; system should be doing that more often. That #8217;s all I #8217;m saying.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>It's about the culture. They look at every decision as a long term decision. They draft smart, they don't waste money, they don't reach. It is a system of patience and long term success. They give players and coaches plenty of opportunities to be successful. They value building a culture and not making snap decisions. They are loyal, sometimes to a fault. Also, they play hard, run the ball, create pressure on the QB and build their offense and defense from the line out.</TEXT>

Rosario is only 22 years old and I think could be another big part of the future. Guillorme is 23 and won't hit .300, but will contribute. The pitching staff is a whole other thing. DeGrom is 29 and just hitting his stride. Thor needs to figure out how to make his fastball move just a little more and he could be as good as DeGrom. I like these pieces, I just don't know why we keep supplementing good pieces with old, worn out pieces.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I am a Mets fan! I am saying that we have shown willingness to bring on players after a bad year, but I was making a joke that Bobby Bonilla never gave the return on the investment since we were hoping for a bounce back year... Geez... We could create a decent list of players the Mets brought on after "down" years and I would venture to guess it would be more disappointing then we would think. Also, this has nothing to do with the time value of money or inflation. Continuing to pay someone year after year for not adding any value is still stupid, no matter how you count it. Unless you count the yearly reminder that we are still paying Bonilla as "adding value."</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I think you are doing the same. Please don't turn the Bobby Bonilla deal into Mike Hampton and David Wright... The article is painting a picture that it wants to paint. Hindsight is always 20/20. Who knows what could or would have happened if we just bought Bonilla out at the end of his contract. The article only looks at things that did happen and they draw a very thin line to Bonilla's deal. We pay Bobby Bo every year to do nothing for the organization. Every year $1 million hits our cap because of that deal. So your argument that Bonilla's deal helped us land other players works against you. We now have to work within a smaller cap because of the guaranteed money to Bonilla. That $1 million doesn't get smaller based on time value of money or inflation, that $1 million dollars still hits the cap the same amount every year. The Mets should have considered Bonilla a sunk cost at the time and freed him and the team from his salary burden. We are still living with this and will continue to do so.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>We have some aging players that would bring in some decent returns. I am thinking long term, so prospects would be great to get for Cabrera, Frazier, Mesoraco, Lugo, Familia, Swarzak, Blevins, etc. Conforto, Nimmo, deGrom, and Gsellman, maybe Thor are all off the table.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I am not saying we trade everyone, but I am saying that all of these people should be on the block. All of those players I named have value for the right team looking to shore up a position for a playoff run. I'm not saying that they will get top flight prospects back for any or all of them, but if we are looking long term, they could bring back future prospects.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>So I think deleting this is sort of fair and sort of not fair. First, I think the question still stands as to why wouldn't trees help solve the problem. No one on here has "Explained like I'm five" why trees are not a good solution, they only point out where trees can't be placed. Or generally say that it's not a good solution. Second, is the problem with the question that I didn't direct it at only people in a certain area, like the US? I think CO2 emissions are an issue globally, so why not as the question to the whole world? Also, I believe this is an international community. I am asking the question to everyone, not just people in the US. Third, the fact that you point out where trees can not be planted does not take in consideration the wide open expanses throughout the world that can be populated with trees or at least some that used to be populated. Even if you add up all the backyards in America and everyone plants one tree in their own backyard, you could feasibly see millions of trees planted just in the US. So go ahead and delete this question, but understand that I followed the rules and the question is still not answered.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>As someone who moved here almost 5 years ago, here are my thoughts... Portland and the surrounding areas (20-30 minutes) are great. Portland is a foodie town with tons to do. I have kids and we come into Portland often to enjoy the town. There are great schools in some of the surrounding areas, great outdoor spaces to enjoy, and the people are generally nice. I have been through many more towns further away and some are great places to settle down and spread out. Like any other state, there are nice locations and not so nice locations. Maine has a great beer scene, tons of outdoor options, there are mountains, lakes, ocean and open spaces to enjoy. Tons of hiking and biking trails and just about anything else you want. I would agree about the job market, depending on your skill set, you might find it difficult to find a job. Unemployment here is like 1.5%, historically low and jobs will often see tons of applicants for every job posted. People often complain about the winters, and don't get me wrong, they are long and cold, but people around here are prepared and almost always willing to help out. The summer and fall can't be beat. You'll want to enjoy everything the state has to offer in those seasons. It's a beautiful state with good, salt of the earth people. We plan on staying forever.</TEXT>

    <TITLE>Beginner looking for some help/advice</TITLE>
    <DATE>2018-07-23 17:22:24</DATE>
    <TEXT>Hello everyone! So I bought a concept2 recently because I loved the workout during crossfit sessions, wanted to be able to workout at any time of day, and have a lower impact on my body. Since buying my rower and starting to do some "training", I figured I would ask all of you for some advice. I am currently following [the 24 week "Pete Plan."](https://thepeteplan.wordpress.com/beginner-training/) I am looking for a heart rate monitor that will sync with my Iphone as well as the app that would be good for training sessions. I call the "training" sessions even though I am nowhere near what any of you are doing. I was gassed after my 25 minute 6000m row this weekend. I want a way to track progress and monitor things as I am rowing. Also, my legs sometimes fall asleep after about 4000-5000m. I figured it's just something I need to work through, but I was wondering if anyone out there had some advice on that. Thanks in advance for any help!!</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Well.... Since you have received so much help already... I would suggest heading into Portland and exploring the shops and eateries. Portland is a foodie town and you will find that almost every place you go has something good on the menu. Other options are breweries and distilleries. There are plenty of places to enjoy nature throughout Maine, check out Fort Williams in Cape Elizabeth then head to the Lobster Shack at Two Lights for some lobster rolls and pie. If you are the hiking types, then hit up a few trails. There are tons around! Good luck and enjoy!</TEXT>

    <TEXT>First off, MBA over MHA. The business background from an MBA will put you ahead of a lot of people in the field. Also, it opens more doors to you outside of just hospitals. Source: I have my BA in Accounting and MBA and it allowed me to pick from job offers because of my unique background.  #8203; As for hospital admin, well that really depends on the culture of the company. I have worked for places that require hefty call requirements, must be able to be reached while on vacation, etc. I have also worked for companies that value time away and encourage it. Places that tell you to turn off and enjoy and come back recharged. You will have to figure that out in your process. Working for a hospital system will more than likely feel like you are tied to the job more since it is a 24/7/365 company.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I agree, to some extent. Most guys coming out of high school and college are expected to play multiple positions. This is also one of the reasons CF, SS, and 2B are highly valued, because the expectation is that if they can play those positions, they can play any of the other positions on the field. All of that being said, the Mets refuse to allow a player to grow and learn a position over time because they are trying to force feed them into the big league lineup. They do this by moving them around to whatever position currently has the most people hurt. This does not allow a player to learn a new position, grow, and flourish in that position. I would like to see a better focus on athletic position players that can play up the middle, then move them to areas of need and let them learn that position, get comfortable, and see if they can flourish. This all takes time.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Portland and the surrounding areas are perfect for a Honeymoon. Portland is a foodie town so you will eat well, but what other things do you want to do? If you want to spend time in a cabin and  #8220;get snowed in #8221; I would look for places around lake Sebago. Those homes are usually much cheaper in the winter and you will have amazing views of the lake in winter. Also, Portland isn #8217;t too far, depending on where on the lake you stay.

So what you have there is a bill for the office visit/physical exam and possibly a test, procedure, or immunization given. Did you get your flu shot at the visit?

    <TEXT>Where do I start? Yes, this is 100% normal. Crossfit is hard, but you are doing the most important thing, which is showing up and working hard. Take a step back a realize that there are so many different movements that you have learned in the past 7 months. How many times did you hit your old gym and work on snatches? How many times did you crank out a bunch of burpees and then hop on a rower? Crossfit pushes you in ways no other workout will. It it totally normal to still feel like you are catching up. I #8217;ve only been Crossfitting for 15 months and there are so many things I either can #8217;t do or really struggle with. Cardio is still one of those things. Just remember that cardio heavy days also usually have some other movements that make it hard to recover your breathing and that #8217;s why the second and third rounds are way harder than they would be if you were just running. Think about all the things you #8217;ve learned so far and focus on improving each day, not matter how small the improvement. After a year you will look back and be amazed. You are right where you should be in your journey. Now just keep showing up and working hard. Your coaches are doing the right thing by scaling you back. Trust the process. Good luck!!</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Directly from the FAQ Section of the website. I #8217;m doing your program and my gym #8217;s regular stuff. Is this cool? We're not wild about this idea. If you #8217;re doing a specialized program, it #8217;s because your regular stuff wasn #8217;t giving what you wanted, right? It #8217;s OK to do a regular gym stuff once in a while, jump in a class with your friends, etc., but it shouldn #8217;t compete with your specialized programming. If you insist on doing your gym #8217;s stuff along with our stuff, be sure to adjust your sleeping, eating and recovery activities accordingly. Can I do additional work after I finish the day #8217;s programming? We prefer you don #8217;t. The programs are written to stress you, not to destroy you. If you finish the day #8217;s training and still have some energy left, save it. Tomorrow is another training day.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Best decision of my life. I got out of a town that was, still is, failing, got a better job in a state I love and started laying down roots. The town you grow up in will always be a part of you, but it shouldn #8217;t be the only part. There are towns and cities all over the world that will welcome you and you will be happy. Also, little bonus, you can be a whole new person if you move. No one there knows you, so you can start over. If you were a complete asshat, now you can be a nice person. If you got in trouble a lot or did stupid shit, now you can start fresh and be a good person. Find a gym, find a grocery store, find a job, and see how it goes.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I love Brandon Sanderson and his world building. I really enjoyed Game of Thrones, mostly again for the world building. Dune was great, the Ender #8217;s series was great, even Lord the Rings even if it was a little more detailed about hobbits than I would have liked. I #8217;m looking for a series, ideally one that is on audiobook as well, to fill the void I have until book four comes out from Sanderson. I #8217;ve read all of Sanderson #8217;s books, so I #8217;m not looking for more in his series, I #8217;m looking for another author. I #8217;ve read the Wheel of Time as well. That #8217;s how I found Sanderson! Thanks in advance!</TEXT>

    <TEXT>This is the right answer. You are not their friend, you are responsible for the work that the team puts out. You will also need private space/time to get things done that can #8217;t be done in the open. You will need to have conversations with the individuals that need to be private. Also, don #8217;t make your office feel like the principal #8217;s office. Bring people in to your office to chat, get feedback, and for other positive reasons, not only when they are being chastised. Give good feedback in a group, negative feedback in private.

Yes the Pats are loaded, but aren #8217;t we supposed to at least put up a fight? Should every team that plays the Pats just bend over and take what they give them? 3 points from an offense that was supposed to show off how they didn #8217;t need Brown and Bell. Giving up 33 points from a Defense that was supposedly faster, more aggressive, and can cover anyone. People are pissed for a reason.

    <TEXT>Self sabotage is a form of control. You are controlling the outcome. You know you won #8217;t be top of the leader board or done as well as you can because you created an excuse for yourself. It #8217;s akin to hearing people at the end of the WOD talk about how they should have scaled it or they could have done the Rx weight. Focus on the stimulus you want from the workout and push yourself there. Don #8217;t do DT at 155 if you can #8217;t move quickly throughout all the reps. Scale it down because it #8217;s more a fast grind then a marathon. Are you afraid that others in the gym will beat you? Are you afraid of failure? Are you just sick of crossfit right now? You need to figure those things out to really answer your question.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>God forbid an injured player doesn #8217;t just sit and sulk on the sideline but instead engages his teammates and tries to keep the mood light. He #8217;s a damn good WR and we need him out on the field, if at least to help draw double teams to free up other players. And yes, we all still want to see this team in the playoffs. The defense is terrifying for other teams and as true fans, we want the best for our team. We aren #8217;t the Bengals or Browns fans that put up the white flag the second the team loses a couple games. Get out of here with your crappy attitude.</TEXT>

    <DATE>2020-01-09 14:43:36</DATE>
    <TEXT>What is the interaction between the collection of Energy Counters and Proliferate? For example, if I first play [[Consul #8217;s Shieldguard]] and collect my two energy counters, then play [[Guildpact Informant]], does  #8220;Proliferate #8221; create another energy token for me to collect per creature that generates tokens or do I just get one since they all collect in one location? Trying to see if then proliferate mechanic is useful in gaining tokens or if flicker is the better option. Thanks for your help!</TEXT>

    <TEXT>The overall issue is that there aren #8217;t enough tests to test everyone that shows symptoms. It #8217;s not right. Testing was delayed by people who thought that the virus either didn #8217;t exist or thought they had it under control. Quest is 7-10 days behind in processing tests as well, so that is a huge problem all across the country. My only suggestion is to call your PCP, request a test from them, cross your fingers, and hope for the best! You can also try to go to one of the testing centers that Intermed, Martins Point, or Maine Med are running.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Well as others have replied, it #8217;s really about dedication to the task. Eating clean, working out, and getting good sleep is the recipe. There is no magic to it, just hard work. I am a firm believer in intermittent fasting, heavy weights (with proper form), and getting 7-8 hours a sleep at night. Those things will get you there. I #8217;m 38, I #8217;ve been crossfitting for a few years and I #8217;m in the best shape of my life. I #8217;m not  #8220;ripped #8221; but I #8217;m strong and muscular. When I buckle down I can see my abs and that #8217;s good enough for me. I #8217;ve got 3 kids, a wife, and a very busy job. Baby abs are my sweet spot.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I agree we need to be safe and smart. I think a large part of that is everyone in the state doing their part to prevent the spread, which means masking, distancing, and yes, closing some businesses down that can not achieve those things. I really struggle with the people that don't think it even exists or that its just a little cold. There are young people as well as old people getting sick and dying. The outbreaks happening all over the state tied to just two events shows you how quickly this can spread and that it doesn't care if you are young or old. I think that if everyone got on board with masking and distancing for 4-6 weeks, we would have already been out of this. Not just Maine, the entire country, but we had people that wouldn't follow simple directions from experts in the field. Shame on all of us.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Hey there, late 30s guy, buying my first truck and I don #8217;t even know what I should be looking for in options. I have three kids and a wife, so I need room for all of them, I guess. I won #8217;t be towing anything heavy, so no super duper hauling packages. Simple yard work, small projects, moving things from one place to another, and traveling with the family are my biggest needs. Ford has a hybrid coming which is interesting to me because of gas mileage. I don #8217;t want to break the back either, so nothing too fancy, but a remote start will be vital, I live in Maine and it gets wicked cold up here. 4 wheel drive is a must for driving in the snow. Hoping this doesn #8217;t get people into a fight. I know people are passionate about their trucks. I want something that will last me a long time and won #8217;t cost me an arm and a leg for ongoing maintenance. Your wisdom will be greatly appreciated.</TEXT>
