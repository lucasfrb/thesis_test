    <TEXT>I'm not american and I'm not into politics but tell me. What did Trump so bad that everyone hates him? Is it just hate because it's mainstream to hate president or what? I don't know. Well don't take me wrong. I think that Trump is an idiot but not bigger than most of people I have seen. From what I have seen so far I think that he is a better president than Obama was. I don't want to start a political discussion but just try to explain it to me simply. Yeah also don't even try to tell me something about him being a racist. Almost every president was called racist that's propaganda. I don't wanna read propaganda.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Well I don't know the details but I can see where you're probably right. But at least he knows thing or two about economics doesn't he? If I'm not wrong he helped America economy pretty much. I'm not really sure I got it only from one source so don't take me like I'm claiming that it is true. I can see that he fucked up really many things from what you wrote. Well I can't say he's a good president but I'd probably rather have him than Biden. As I said I'm not into politics and I'm not American so I have only some informations. I'm just trying to not listen to mainstream media. That's probably the worst source possible.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>To be honest the only reason why I'd probably rather vote Trump than Biden is because Biden seems to be too old and his brain seems to be melting down. Again it could be because of propaganda trying make one side worse than the another one. I just want to thank you for your opinion and calm answers. Usually when someone says something about politics it gets really nasty and violent. You showed me another page of the book and that's what politics should be about. So once again thank you.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>He's only 3 years older? Well he looks much older in my opinion. Another thing I was wrong about. This is going to be truly interesting future for America and not only America. Now I think that they are both terrible (even worse than before) candidates for president and that could be most likely a fact. Damn I do not envy American voters now. Do you have any informations about Trump's health after covid-19? I saw video of him and he seemed to be struggling with breathing. He really didn't look healthy at all.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>That's ignorant claim. I know I won't change your mind but I'll try to pull out some numbers for you. I assume you're talking about American cops. Black people are only 13% of America. Cca 53% of crimes are commited by black people. It is logical that black people are getting more often in contact with police. Also actually white people die 20x more often in contact with police than black people. I know you'll ignore the data so I won't be arguing with you. Have a nice day and try to be objective. Don't be angry just because other people are angry. Also it's just a meme. You're supposed to either laugh or ignore. Don't bring real life problems to a sandbox.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>He died of overdose by drugs. That asshole definetly helped him to his grave but still it was mainly the drug in his case. But yeah you're right about police brutality. They once murdered a guy that was not drug addicted. He had clear crime report. Also he didn't resist the arrest. However he was white. Just a shame I can't remember his name. If you do remember his name (Which you probably don't because media didn't give a fuck about him so nobody really cares much) please tell me. Police in America is brutal but not racist. Well ... at least in most cases. There are definetly racist scums. But that's like not even 8% I guess ... unless it's some wild part of America... Don't take me wrong. I hate police brutality and all. But today people call everything racist so I can't take a claim about someone being racist to be serious anymore.</TEXT>
