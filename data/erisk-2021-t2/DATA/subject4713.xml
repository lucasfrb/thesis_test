    <TEXT>I've seen many snark on Jerm for his use of fountain pens, but actually I'm a huge fan of them! They're eco friendly: you can use them forever and buy ink in glass bottles. You can buy all sorts of fun inks in gorgeous colors, even shimmery or two toned ones. Sure, I think 1500$ pens are excessive but fountain pens aren't intrinsically snobby. Maybe it's a culture thing? In countries other than the US (including my country) they're much more common. We had to use exclusively fountain pens to write with in primary school. Also, it's good for your fine motor skills apparently. Anyway, any other FP lovers in this sub?</TEXT>
