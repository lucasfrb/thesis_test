    <TEXT>For impressed, I gotta go with Abi, she managed to make a good turn around. Terry did a great job with Abi too. Joe is also the kingpin of his tribe. Woo has also learned from last time, he's not going taking crap from Shirin and Spencer. For dissapointments, I gotta go with Fishbach again...what is he doing? That tribe swap better save him. And Monica still continues to get no screentime. Some things never change....</TEXT>

    <TITLE>An idea for another type of idol with special powers.</TITLE>
    <DATE>2015-10-01 20:29:55</DATE>
    <TEXT>This hidden immunity idol, if played, will negate all of the votes and give you the sole vote for the night. The catch- you must get the most votes that night, and ties do not count, a tie would pretty much be the same as getting no votes. It must also be played before the votes are read, and you cannot give it to anyone else. Thoughts?</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I gotta say, I really liked that season. I was going into it expecting it to be boring (based on what I've heard) but I was really entertained. Keep in mind, the season I watched before was Redemption Island..... I am now also a part of the "T-Bird got robbed!" bandwagon.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>.....then Survivor history as a whole would be changed. Had Brandon voted for Lex, then Lex would have gone home at 9th place, which presumably means that he wouldn't be cast in All stars. This means rob wouldn't have been able to make that deal with Lex, which presumably means that Rob and Amber don't make it to the end, which means that Rob wouldn't be casted on Heroes vs villains, which means that Rob and Russell wouldn't butt heads, which means that Redemption island would not have happened.

    <TITLE>My experience at the meet and greet</TITLE>
    <DATE>2016-01-31 01:10:10</DATE>
    <TEXT>I have just come home from Meg and Andrea's meet and greet (unfortunately I couldn't go to the bar night, I am only 19, very heartbreaking.) I had a wonderful time. It was very crowded, I guess Andrea and Meg weren't prepared for all of those people. We had to wait in a huge line, and we didn't really get to speak to a lot of them in great detail. That being said, I did get to talk to four of them and talk about the show. I spoke to Mike Holloway. He seemed like a really chill dude and I loved talking to him. We didn't really talk about the game, but my opinion of him definitely went up a bit after meeting him in person. I also got to speak with Fishbach, I had to hold back on calling him "poopy pants" because I really respected and liked him. I told him how much I love the show, and that I watched the entirety of it in four months with heavy binge watching, and I really want to get on the show. He liked my enthusiasm. I got to talk to Brian when I got to him, first off before I got in he asked me where he had to go, and afterwards he asked me where the bathrooms are, lol. When I was actually in the room, I told him that his season was very underrated. He was very happy to hear that SOMEONE loves his season. Then I got to talk to Denise Martin, someone I didn't expect to be there. I was waiting on line and my friend noticed Denise Martin, and I didn't see her. Then I went in and I actually saw it was her! When I got to her we talked about China. My friend was very upset that they voted her out instead of Todd, and even she was frustrated with that, since she believed that Todd had the game locked up already. Then later on I spoke to Kelley Wentworth, the first thing I said to her was that Drew Christy was right about her being a threat. I told her that I was very upset that she lost, and that I was more happy that Spencer and Tasha were shut out than Jeremy winning. She agreed, but to keep it there, so I'm guessing there was a lot of beef going on. Then my friend asked if they did hide an idol at final 5. She said that she couldn't find it. Then I asked how it was like living with Abi, she said it was hard work. I got pictures with everyone that was there, but some of them (Eliza, Sophie) only signed my buff and took a picture with me, and then went on their way. I was hoping I would get a chance to gush over Sophie more since I liked her a lot. I told her I was happy she beat Ozzy and Coach, and she liked that. I didn't really get a chance to say much more. Overall, it was a very fun night for a good cause. I have pictures and my signed buff, which I may be uploading soon.</TEXT>

Would you vote for this person to win the game? On one hand, winning all of those duels is very impressive, but on the other hand, I wouldn't want to vote for someone that barely spent any time on the island playing the actual game.</TEXT>

    <DATE>2016-05-19 04:07:25</DATE>
    <TEXT>I really loved the season, but man that finale and reunion left a very bad taste in my mouth. It started off good.....but that stupid twist where Neal was taken off of the jury. That was the worst twist ever. Then we go to final 3 where Aubry runs circles around the others in FTC, then it's revealed that Michele wins. Now I believe every winner deserves it. I will defend Natalie white, Sandra, Sophie, Danni, Fabio....but I can't see why Michele won over aubry. Now the stolen vote didn't make a difference at least, but Aubry seemed so much better. Then we got a bad reunion where only 6 people got to speak and Jeff talks to Cochran, Sia comes in stage, and so does Drew Carrey. Probably the worst reunion show since Caramoan. What did you all think?</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I have an interesting relationship with this show. It's on again off again. I'm really into it for a bit but then I fall out of it. Last year I was following Season 5 but I think I missed one episode and I stopped watching (the last one I watched was Amending Fences) Today I decided to finish up the season and I can't believe how good it ended up being, especially the finale! I was hooked from Canterlot Boutique onward- the episodes got really compelling. I really liked *The Mane Attraction* and the finale. I'm so glad I got back into the show.</TEXT>

What if she won again? What if she won an all winners season (or any all stars season), with seasoned players that actually know what they're doing?

    <TITLE>My Survivor Fanfiction- Survivor Hawaii (starring my coworkers)</TITLE>
    <DATE>2016-10-20 01:54:28</DATE>
    <TEXT>One night I was bored at work at the supermarket and talking to one of my coworkers (who is my best friend at work and a huge fan of Survivor, he got me into it as a matter of fact) and we had a random discussion about how people at our workplace (we work at a supermarket) would do on Survivor. As a result: [this happened.](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1wh2yQmvCQDWhaXeuddRj7ttDYcCCj19MxFfcQi4jfdY/edit?usp=sharing) I wrote a Survivor fanfiction starring people from my work. I have written two of them, this is the second one, which I think is better. In the lush islands of Hawaii, 16 of my coworkers fight to become the Sole Survivor. This season takes place in an alternate universe, where every season up to 32 has aired, and this is the 33rd season. None of these people know each other in the show, but I base the relationships the characters in this season off of the relationships in real life. This season has 16 people. I will give you brief descriptions on these characters: Ruvu Tribe (the tribe names I completely made up, and have no basis in Hawaiian culture) Alex(18): He's a cancer survivor, but as far as I know, he may be a pothead. Mike(33): He's a pretty cool guy, He is a straight up savage, but I don't think I really captured that part of his personality in this season. Still, a really cool guy. Kyle(19): A really nice guy, He doesn't have a mean bone in his body. Evan(17): Kinda annoying. He doesn't do a lot of work and he rarely shows up. Lorrie (63): An older lady who works at night. She's a nice lady, but she can get PISSED if you push her. Darlene (45): Another lady that works at night. She is a nice lady but she sometimes stirs up trouble. Briana (19): A nice girl, She's a good friend of mine but she's very feisty. Madison(17): Another girl. She's currently dating Briana. Hokana tribe Greg (24): Ugh, the worst guy at my job. He's beloved by our store manager yet he doesn't do shit. He's a total bully and I can't stand him. Nicole (19): Probably one of the bitchiest girls I have ever met, and wouldn't you know it she's dating the person above. I can't fucking stand her and I make sure to work when she isn't working. Casey(26): She works on the front, and she's all buddy buddy with the two people I listed above. When she's not with them, she's tolerable, but when she is, it's not fun. She's also a major pothead. Christina(19): A friend of Nicole, who brought her to my job. There isn't really much to say about her, other than the fact she's friends with them. Matt(17): A very nice kid, but has been known to be swayed easily. Lately, he's been bullied by the people listed above. Jalend(18): He doesn't really do much work at all, but he mostly keeps to himself. John (18): He's fine in work, but he's a pothead outside of work. Alanna (27): A nice girl, one of my friends. She's a fun person. I hope you enjoy my story, it took me a week to write this. Disclaimer: I may have exaggerated some of the personalities, not everyone that is in this is like this in real life.</TEXT>

    <TITLE>I held a homemade game of Survivor at my house. It was quite fun!</TITLE>
    <DATE>2018-06-10 23:40:44</DATE>
    <TEXT>Yesterday I held a homemade game of Survivor at my house. I was playing and my friend hosted it. Most of the people here have never seen Survivor, but some have seen Total Drama before. We held a Survivor game last year....but it didn't go as well. 5 people from last year returned to play again. We had a wide variety of challenges, including an egg toss, gross food eating challenge (drinks mixed with condiments), musical chairs, touchy subjects, and more. There were idols to find and plenty of advantages. Most of the people here have never seen the show (but at least know about it) but I was the only one, so naturally I was a threat to them. Two weeks ago I had a college graduation party and the host hid a secret advantage at that party, which I found, which would protect me at the first vote. If my team won the first challenge then I would have to give it to someone on the losing team (basically Chrissy's super idol). My team won the first challenge and I gave it to the person that did the worst in the challenge, and that person got all the votes and his sole vote was the deciding vote. Unfortunately my tribe lost the next challenge and I was voted out right after, in a 3-2-1-1 vote. There was one person on my team that was blatantly targeting me since the beginning and he had a lot of influence amongst the tribe, and there wasn't much I could do to save myself, as I couldn't find an idol. There would be a challenge later to get a chance to come back in the game, but I failed to win it and I was out for good. But I got to watch how the rest of the game played out. There weren't really that many solid alliances, but there were many people playing hard. The way idols worked premerge was that they would be specific to whatever team you were on, and if you found the other team's idol, then you have to will it to someone on the other team. There was also a universal idol that could be played regardless of what team you were on. Only two idols were found, one person was voted out with an idol in their pocket at the final 6, and the other was played at 5 by default. There were several advantages, including one where you could force someone to sit out of a challenge, which I found. I got voted out before I could play it, but the host allowed me to rehide it after I got voted out. Someone else found it, but also got voted out with it and it ultimately never got played. There was also a vote steal and an extra vote hidden, but someone got voted out with the vote steal and the extra vote was basically wasted. There was also another advantage that could be used at the final 9 or final 7 which would divide the remaining players into teams, with the person using the advantage being immune for the round. The final 3 was a strong group of players, including the one that won the challenge to come back into the game (he was originally voted out 4th). The final 2 consisted of a powerful duo that no one targeted until the end. One player played a very aggressive game and backstabbed many people, but unfortunately ignored the social game. The other played a very quiet game but made good relationships with everyone and made very subtle moves behind the scenes. He won the game in a 10-2 vote. It was a lot of fun and next year I will be cohosting it with my friend. I'm really looking forward to doing it again.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>After the Civil Rights Act the south started to trend more Republican. Arkansas was one of the more heavily Democratic states of the South, having voted straight Democratic from 1876 to 1964, while other southern states have broken towards Republican during that time. The Republicans started to gain ground in Presidential elections, Nixon won every county in 1972, but Carter won overwhelmingly in 1976. After that, however, the state started becoming more reliably Republican in presidential elections, voting for Reagan narrowly in 1980 and by a more decisive margin in 84 and 88. Clinton won the state in 92 and 96, and from then on out, the state continued to go Republican by increasing margins. However, Democrats were still doing well in state level and local elections. The Arkansas Legislature had a Democratic majority until 2012, and had two Democratic Senators from 2002-2010. Case in point- Mark Pryor ran for re-election in 2008 with no opposition and then lost to Tom Cotton in 2014 by almost 20 points.</TEXT>

    <TITLE>Today I had a homemade version of Survivor at my house. Here are the details!</TITLE>
    <DATE>2019-07-14 11:02:55</DATE>
    <TEXT>Since 2017, my friend and I have hosted real life versions of Survivor with friends from college, most of them having never seen the real show before. Last year I played and flamed out early, this year I was co-hosting the game with my friend so we could collaborate and share ideas together. We had a cast of 16 people, and originally we were going to have a twist where one person was voted out, and they would be exiled and come back and replace the player that was voted out, and in addition that player would pick the teams. But since one player was late, we started with 15 and that player came after the tribes were randomly drawn, so he was a reward for the winning team of the first challenge. The first few challenges included a relay race (which consisted of blowing up balloons to blow over cups, flip cup, balancing a ping pong ball on a plate and carrying it around the perimeter of the house), a can stacking challenge where players must balance a platform and stack 4 cans on the platform, and a blindfolded challenge where a caller must guide blindfolded players to letter tiles to solve a word puzzle. After that, we had a tribe swap, where we had a yearly egg toss, and then we had the "Greedy" challenge, similar to the one used in Survivor Maryland, except it ended in less than a minute. Then we had a merge and had several exciting challenges, including a balloon smash, also making an appearance in Survivor Maryland, where players tie balloons to their ankles and smash them with their feet. We did this challenge in two rounds, 1) for someone to come back into the game, and 2) for the first individual immunity. Next we had a challenge where players had to run up a hill, count objects that were placed on top of the hill, and use the numbers to solve a math problem. Next we had another Survivor classic, musical chairs, but with a twist, everyone was blindfolded. This got really chaotic and was very fun to watch. After that we had the eating challenge, featuring dishes like stale chicken fingers (another shout out to Survivor Maryland), and jalapeno peppers, and a third planned dish of herring in cream sauce, but since one player did not eat the jalapeno in the second round round and one player threw up (and ended up drinking an entire half gallon of milk) we ended the challenge and awarded immunity to the player who kept it down. Next we had a challenge where players had to watch a video and remember details about it, and answer questions about it. Then from there on out, the challenges were straight up endurance, including balancing cans on small dowels, a wood balancing challenge where players had to press two pieces of wood against each other with smaller blocks, and then the final immunity, stacking coins on the bottom of a baseball bat and trying not to drop them. Then we had our final tribal council, where some people had no hard feelings but others really ripped into the final 3. Everyone that played was on jury, so that the people that were out early could still participate. The dynamics of the game were interesting because a lot of people that were here already knew each other from school, but there were some that didnt, but they were able to integerate well into the group. Advantages were hidden throughout the game, including basics like idols, but also stuff like extra votes, vote steals, and some advantages we came up with on our own, including an advantage which lets you kidnap someone from the losing tribe, an advantage that lets you expel someone from tribal council post merge, giving them safety but preventing them from voting or playing advantages. Idols were more prominent this year, as more were played and rehidden, and this year, TWO people were voted out with idols in their pockets. Not only that, but we had a repeat of Advantagegeddon at the final 5 with someone getting Cirie'd, three idols were played, and by default, that eliminated the last person without immunity (although unlike Cirie, he had votes cast against him). In the end, it was a fairly close vote, with our winner winning in a 7-4-2 vote. This was definitely a fun day, and everyone really enjoyed it. One of my friends said it felt like he was on the real show! I already can't wait for next year. And of course, I have to give credit to /u/survivormaryland (and /u/nickinor) /u/SurvivorWashington, and Survivor New Mexico for the ideas for the challenges that we used.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>This was from a few months ago, but i went to see Avengers Endgame a week after it came out, and right after i saw the movie i was going to hang out with two of my friends. One of them (F) had seen the movie, the other (M) doesn't really care for superhero movies and has said that time and time again (he even fell asleep during Captain America Civil War). When i met up with my friends, I immediately made it clear that i saw the movie and that i was gonna talk about it. I was talking about details of the movie with my friend (F) and my other friend (M) didn't say anything before i started talking about the movie. Then later on he said that i shouldn't have spoiled the movie in the event that he may want to see it later on, even though he didn't say anything before and he has said time and time again he has zero interest in Marvel movies. AITA?</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Mitch McConnell is a senator from Kentucky, having served since 1985. In 2007 he became the republican Senate leader, and has served in that position since then. He was most notorious for being an obstructionist to Obama's agenda, and changing rules to make sure Obama couldn't get anything done, including blocking bills he introduced just because Obama supported it. One of the most notorious things he did was refuse to let Obama even have a hearing for Scalia's open Supreme Court Justice seat, even telling Obama straight to his face, "you will not fill this seat". He has done everything in his power to destroy the fabric of democracy as we know it.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>So for context, here's what going on. There are two alliances, one made up of The Four Horsemen, consisting Alex, Edgardo, and Mookie. the other alliance is made up of Yau-Man, Earl, Stacy, Cassandra, and Boo, with Dreamz playing both sides. The Horsemen are in the minority but have the hidden immunity idol, which allows a player to negate votes cast against them. Before tribal council, the horsemen are contemplating playing the idol on either Alex or Mookie, and the other alliance is between them as well, with Dreamz going back and forth between the two alliances. Stacy comes up with the plan to blindside Edgardo out of nowhere and leave Dreamz in the dark, leading to Edgardo's blindside and the fall of the horsemen.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Actually, that's not true. (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yQLbNekBU1A) What would happen is, if there is no election, Trump and Pence would leave office, since their term expires on January 20th, 2021. In addition, if there is no house election, they are termed out on the 3rd of January, and every representative would be out of office as well, including every senator up for election this year, which are 23 Republicans and 12 Democrats. Those seats would remain unfilled, and there would be more Democrats than Republicans in the remaining class of senators, so Patrick Leahy, who would become President pro tempore, would become President.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Many things wrong here: 1) That is true, Hoover won some southern states that election, mostly because Democratic candidate Al Smith was Catholic. The KKK despised Smith and supported Hoover in that election, which helped Hoover carry Texas, North Carolina, Florida, Tennessee and Virginia, but the rest of the deep south still voted for the Democrats (Arkansas, Louisiana, Alabama, Mississippi, Georgia, and S. Carolina). But there was no down ballot effect, and the south went solidly Democratic in the next election. 2) Yes, only one senator switched. That one senator was Strom Thurmond, one of the most ardent segregationists in the senate. He switched parties when Barry Goldwater campaigned against the Civil Rights Act, and he switched also in due part because he was able to keep his seniority. Incumbent senators rarely switch parties, mostly because they lose all their seniority if they switch. Rather, the civil rights act led to more Republicans being elected, and several politicians switching parties before being elected, notable examples being future Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott, North Carolina senator Jesse Helms, and Mississippi Senator Thad Cochran, all who were Democrats before switching to the Republican party. 3) Again, that is true. The parties didn't immediately changed, that's a strawman. While the south flipped on the presidential level sooner in the 60s and 70s, people were still voting Democrat on down ballot races, as southerners still identified with the Democrats on a local level, as those races are considered low information environments. However, as the Republicans started running more conservative candidates and older Democrats started passing away, the Republican made footholds in local and state races. Here are some links that debunk PragerU's bullshit videos on the party switch.

    <TEXT>"Every gun that is made, every warship launched, every rocket fired signifies, in the final sense, a theft from those who hunger and are not fed, those who are cold and are not clothed. This world in arms is not spending money alone. It is spending the sweat of its laborers, the genius of its scientists, the hopes of its children. The cost of one modern heavy bomber is this: a modern brick school in more than 30 cities. It is two electric power plants, each serving a town of 60,000 population. It is two fine, fully equipped hospitals. It is some fifty miles of concrete pavement. We pay for a single fighter with a half-million bushels of wheat. We pay for a single destroyer with new homes that could have housed more than 8,000 people. . . . This is not a way of life at all, in any true sense. Under the cloud of threatening war, it is humanity hanging from a cross of iron." -Dwight Eisenhower</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Their video on the party switch was one of their worst videos and has been thoroughly debunked. Here are some sources: https://youtu.be/31mvbVBV3X0 https://youtu.be/MwuFIJlY7fU https://twitter.com/kevinmkruse/status/996386257109508096?lang=en Myth #1: yes, several southern states including Virginia, Tennessee Texas, North Carolina, and Florida voted Republican for the first time since Reconstruction. This is mostly attributed to that Hoover was nationally popular and Democratic nominee Al Smith was hated in the South since he was Catholic and opposed prohibition. Myth #2: no one argues that every southern democrat became a republican instantly, that's a strawman. While only one democrat switched, that one democrat was Strom Thurmond, a noted segregationist who filibustered the Civil Rights Act. He switched because he was able to keep his seniority. It's very rare for incumbent politicians to switch parties since they lose seniority and the benefits that come with it. Rather, the voters changed who they voted for, and these Democrats were replaced with Republicans. Notable examples include future senate majority leader Trent Lott, Jesse Helms, Thad Cochran, among others. These politicians were Democrats but then ran as Republicans. Myth 3: again, saying the parties immediately switched is a strawman. While the south moved towards the Republican party more instantaneously, they were still voting Democratic in downballot races. Many southern voters still identified with the democratic party, and since local and state races are low information environments, people were still voting Democratic down the ballot. However, as incumbents retired and older Democratic voters started dying off, the GOP started running more conservative candidates under their party, and younger voters who had no attachment to the Democratic party started voting for the GOP. The Southern strategy wasn't uniform, some southern states elected GOP senators early on (Al Gore Sr. was specifically targeted in 1970) where some seats took several years to flip (Louisiana didn't elect a GOP senator by popular vote until 2004, Arkansas didn't have 2 GOP senators until 2014, and 2019 was the first time Republicans held 2 senate seats in Florida at the same time)</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Yup, much like Kentucky, West Virginia was historically a Democratic state but turned Republican over the course of the 2000s. It has voted Republican in every presidential election since Bush, and in 2014 they elected their first GOP senator since the 50s and took control of the state legislature that same year. Joe Manchin is basically the last holdout of a time where Democrats dominated the state.</TEXT>
