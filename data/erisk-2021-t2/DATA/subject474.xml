    <TITLE>I have a semi-successful gag comic currently on hiatus; would like to start again, in need of an artist.</TITLE>
    <DATE>2015-08-10 21:20:41</DATE>
    <TEXT>What it says on the tin. I'm the creator (writer) of DiscoBleach, a gag-a-day comic that's been gaining a little bit of traction here and there, particularly on Tapastic where it has 850 subscribers. (you can check my submissions to /r/comics for flair, as proof). the tl;dr first: unpaid gig. I'm looking for an artist with whom to have an informal relationship, borne out of sharing the same sense of humor possibly; ideally we would make one comic a week in a simple art style. I can do flats and lettering, in fact everything past inking, since the comics can be devoid of shading. Now for more details. Based on the number of times I've seen it reposted, [this comic may ring a faint bell.](http://i.imgur.com/VCdGJWm.png) you can find the rest of the comics [here](http://discobleach.com/tag/discobleach/). Right now, while I look for a new artist, I'm doing a guest comic series where I enlist the help of artists I meet on forums, or friends, to do one-offs. It's been fun.[ here they are.](http://discobleach.com/tag/guestdrawn/) (I specified this because users landing on the site might be confused) The relationship I had with the previous artist was extremely fluid - we would never make something unless we both thought it was funny, I handled colors on multiple occasions and lettering always, and we also did some of his ideas. I don't expect to recreate a carbon copy of that relationship with someone else, but I wouldn't be displeased if it happened. In short, I would be happy to work with someone who already enjoys what I've created so far, and shares its sensibilities. I'm not very good at pitching. I welcome all criticism of this post insofar as it would help me be more persuasive in the future.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>So far, releasing one's tax returns has been an unwritten rule, under the assumption that a failure to do so would compromise any serious presidential bid. But we are witnessing an exception to that rule right now. Is it possible that legislation will be introduced to prevent this from happening? How would that take place materially? Would it get bipartisan support?</TEXT>

Her name is Melanie Morgan (https://twitter.com/MelMorgan1350/status/931221482671300609) She is a conservative pundit, who works for Media Equalizer (https://twitter.com/mediaequalizer) Her harassment story was published as a Media Equalizer exclusive (https://mediaequalizer.com/brian-maloney/2017/11/melanie-morgan-after-tv-appearance-al-franken-harassed-me-too) And here's where it gets interesting Melanie has been waging a war against Media Matters (follow the hashtag #investigateMediaMatters501c3 on Twitter). Who are Media Matters? from Wiki:  gt;a politically progressive media watchdog in the United States. The organization has a stated mission of "comprehensively monitoring, analyzing, and correcting conservative misinformation in the U.S. media".Set up as a tax-exempt, nonprofit organization, MMfA was founded in 2004 by journalist and political activist David Brock as a counterweight to the conservative Media Research Center. It is known for its aggressive criticism of conservative journalists and media outlets, including its "War on Fox News." They recently weighed in on Hannity's coverage of the Roy Moore scandal, which led to a massive flight of advertisers. Here's what Media Equalizer (Melanie's outlet) had to say:  gt;Momentum on the sponsor mutiny started on Sunday after Media Matters for America (MMFA), the George Soros funded, left wing not-for-profit hate-group with a long history of hatred toward Hannity weighed in. MMFA spun Hannity #8217;s reporting on Moore as support for the embattled Republican U.S. Senate candidate from Alabama. MMFA has encouraged sponsors to desert Hannity #8217;s shows for months, and Hannity #8217;s attempt to cover the Moore story fairly gave MMFA and its supporters a new opening to attack. I think it's fair to say that her investment in defending Roy Moore and fighting the progressive media watchdogs raises some suspicions about the sincerity of her accusation.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Pretty much what the title says. Spent the last six months unemployed and seriously considering suicide. Recently got a job and was listening to logic on the commute home yesterday. This song came on and I realize I don #8217;t want to die anymore. Yesterday was a good day. Edit: I honestly don #8217;t usually like the song that much, and most of the time I #8217;ll skip it, but in that moment it spoke to me. It #8217;s like driving by the same bit of country everyday and I usually don #8217;t care, but some days it #8217;s the most striking, beautiful thing I #8217;ve ever seen. Also, huge thanks to those saying they #8217;re around if I ever need someone to talk to. That right there is one of the reason I love reddit. Obviously there #8217;s assholes on here too, but there #8217;s also people willing to help a total stranger. Which I think is pretty fuckin awesome Edit 2: I get it, the song made you want to kill yourself, I'm a weak bitch that's just gonna feel that way again, and being jobless for six months isn't a good enough reason to feel like I have (obviously there's more going on than just that). Also, what I was trying to say is that the song helped me realize I'm happy and I haven't had those thoughts for a couple of weeks.</TEXT>

    <TITLE>What are the odds of seeing 5 teams from the same league in the next Uefa Champions League?</TITLE>
    <DATE>2018-04-08 16:27:16</DATE>
    <TEXT>In the oingoing season, we were treated to a 5-team presence in the Uefa Champions League: thanks to Manchester United, who missed out on a top 4 finish in the Premier League, but benefited from a recently introduced Uefa rule that grants the Europa League winner a direct Champions League spot. They then became the fifth team to represent England in the competition. This event is even more likely to occur in the next edition of the tournament: a newly minted Uefa rule grants 4 direct spots to each of the top 4 leagues! (previously it was 3 direct spots and 1 playoff spot to the top 3 leagues). How likely are we, then, to see the same phenomenon? I got curious and crunched the numbers. *(Probability data taken from fivethirtyeight.com; [find all their football-related odds here](https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/soccer-predictions/) . Odds below 1% considered negligible.)* How can a team become its league's fifth representative in the Champions League? The requirements are as follows: - The team must participate in the Liga, Premier League, Bundesliga or Serie A; - The team must win the Europa League or the Champions League; - The team must finish fifth or lower in its national league. *--- technically, France and Russia could send 5 teams to the champions league by having their teams win both the Champions League and the Europa League, adding 2 to their 3; however, that is no longer possible this season, so it won't be considered for this post ---* With that in mind, let's take a look at all the teams in the top 4 leagues that are still involved in a european cup, and haven't yet (or definitely haven't) secured a top 4 finish in their league! **PREMIER LEAGUE** - **Liverpool** are very well positioned in the Champions League following their 3-0 win over Manchester City; they have a 16% chance of winning it all. However, their 99% chance of obtaining a top 4 finish in the Premier League makes their prospects of being England's fifth team **negligible**. - **Arsenal** are adrift in the Premier League: their probability of missing out on a top 4 finish is so high, it can be considered a done deal for statistical purposes. They are also doing very well in the Europa League: their triumph is listed as a 23% chance. Therefore, by combining the odds Arsenal have a **23% chance** of being England's fifth team. **LA LIGA** - **Atletico Madrid** are the favorites to win the Europa League, with a 39% chance. However, their current position in La Liga makes it very unlikely for them to miss out on a top 4 finish. **Negligible odds**. - **Real Madrid** are in a very similar position, with favorable odds to win the champions league (25%) but a very low chance of finishing 5th or below in the league. **Negligible odds**. - **Sevilla** are almost certainly out of the top 4 race, which would have made their deep run in the Champions League an interesting prospect. However, their home loss to Bayern Munich makes their prospects dire: **negligible odds**. **BUNDESLIGA** - **RB Leipzig** are in a very precarious position in the Bundesliga: a 5th or worse finish is a toss-up for them, at 51%. They're also in a favorable position in the Europa League following their win over Marseille: 11% chance of winning the cup. That means they have a **6% chance** of being Germany's fifth team. **SERIE A** - **Roma** have not done the job yet in the Serie A: there's a 21% chance for the team to miss out on direct CL qualification this way. However, the loss to Barcelona makes a victory in the Champions League a very unlikely prospect. **Negligible odds**. - **Lazio** are taking advantage of their rivals' weak performances to try and snatch a top 4 finish; a 5th or below finish has a 45% chance of occurring. Their convincing EL win over RB Salzburg also gives them a solid 15% chance of winning that cup. Lazio thus have a **7% chance** of being Italy's fifth team. Here are Europe's top 4 leagues ranked by their probability of sending 5 teams to the Champions League: Rank | League | Odds |  gt;1% Odds |  lt;1% Odds ---|---|----|----|---- 1 | Premier League | 23%| Arsenal | Liverpool 2 | Serie A | 7% | Lazio | Roma 3 | Bundesliga | 6% | RB Leipzig | *none* 4 | Liga |  lt;1% | *none* | Real Madrid, Atletico Madrid, Sevilla</TEXT>

    <TITLE>Quest for the fifth Champions League team: European semifinals update!</TITLE>
    <DATE>2018-04-12 21:29:52</DATE>
    <TEXT>A few days ago, I made [this post](https://www.reddit.com/r/soccer/comments/8ar0sw/what_are_the_odds_of_seeing_5_teams_from_the_same/) detailing which teams from the top 4 leagues have a shot at becoming their country's fifth representative in the Champions League. Make sure to read that first for context. Now that the second legs of the Champions League and the Europa League are over, a few upsets have changed prospects dramatically for some of the teams involved. Here's what's changed! (if a team listed as "negligible odds" in the last post isn't mentioned here, it's because their odds are still negligible or have become zero) **PREMIER LEAGUE** **Arsenal** have done the minimum required to see off their Europa League tie, and they are now through to the semifinals. Thanks to this, their odds of winning the cup have crept up ever so slightly to 25%; they now have a **25% chance** of being England's fifth team. **BUNDESLIGA** **RB Leipzig** have been eliminated from the Europa League following a 5-2 drubbing at the hands of Olympique Marseille! Their chances are now **zero**. **SERIE A** **Roma** have come back from their dead, stunning Barcelona 3-0 in one of the greatest upsets in Champions League history. That means they're now in the running for fifth team! With now an 8% chance of winning the cup, and a 19% chance of finishing 5th or below in the Serie A, Roma now have a **2% chance** of being Italy's fifth team. **Lazio** have been eliminated in humiliating fashion from the Europa League following a 4-1 loss to Salzburg. **Zero chances**. Here are Europe's top 4 leagues ranked by their probability of sending 5 teams to the Champions League: Rank | League | Odds |  gt;1% Odds |  lt;1% Odds ---|---|----|----|---- 1. | Premier League | 25% | Arsenal | Liverpool 2. | Serie A | 2% | Roma | none 3. | Liga |  lt;1% | none | Real Madrid, Atletico Madrid 4. | Bundesliga | zero | none | none **BONUS: quest for the fourth!** French Ligue 1 can send 3 teams (2 direct spots + 1 playoff) to the Champions League. **Olympique Marseille** could be the fourth! Having overturned their loss to Leipzig to progress to the semifinals, Marseille now have a 20% chance of winning the Europa League. Combined with their 56% of finishing 4th or lower in the league, they have an **11% chance** of being France's fourth team (provided the 3rd placed team wins their playoffs). That would be the most France has ever had!</TEXT>

    <TITLE>Are Serie A referees really in the tank for Juventus?</TITLE>
    <DATE>2018-04-29 15:09:34</DATE>
    <TEXT>Yesterday's Derby D'Italia was a match for the ages for a lot of reasons; a lot was riding on it, and the ensuing emotions definitely didn't leave neutrals disappointed. One facet of the match that unfortunately made headlines, as is often the case, was a controversial refereeing decision: Orsato's failure to send off Pjanic for his reckless challenge on Rafinha. The entire footballing community, even Juventus supporters like myself, disagreed with this decision; some, however, took it a step further, and were all too happy to brandish it as evidence that **referees are still conspiring to help Juventus win the title**. This narrative doesn't come from nowhere, of course: if you're only a casual follower of italian football, you still remember **Calciopoli** and the ensuing fallout, and you are totally within your rights to question the legitimacy and impartiality of football institutions in our country. However, there's also the facts. Proving or disproving the conspiracy being discussed here is relatively easy: collect all incorrect refereeing decisions, tally how many of them favored each team and how many disfavored them, and see if a pattern emerges. Thankfully, **Calciomercato.com** have done just that: they've logged these controversial decisions every match day, and the results are totally unsurprising if you've actually been paying attention. Here's a table (updated to matchday 34, on April 24th) of all Serie A teams ranked from most heavily favored, to most heavily disfavored (the teams in **bold** are the ones currently qualified or in the running for a Champions League spot) *(source: http://www.calciomercato.com/news/moviola-classifica-dei-favori-arbitrali-84720)* Rank | Team| Favorable Errors | Unfavorable Errors| Balance ---|---|----|----|---- 1| **Roma**| 6| 1| +5 2 | **Napoli**| 4| 0| +4 2 | Atalanta| 5| 1| +4 4 | Cagliari| 8| 5| +3 4 | Genoa| 5| 2| +3 6| Milan| 5| 3| +2 6 | Chievo| 2| 0| +2 8| **Inter**| 4| 3 | +1 8| Sampdoria| 5| 4| +1 8| Benevento| 4| 3| +1 11| Fiorentina| 6| 5| = 11| Bologna| 4| 4| = 13| Crotone| 3| 4| -1 14| Verona| 2| 4| -2 15| Udinese| 2| 5| -3 15| Sassuolo| 0| 3| -3 15| Torino| 0| 3| -3 18| **Lazio**| 3| 7| -4 18| **Juventus**| 3| 7| -4 20| Spal| 2| 9| -7 What can be inferred from this table? Not an awful lot, really. The more common conspiracy theories are roundly defeated by this simple set of figures, but no countervailing theories emerge - aside from the simple fact that referees make mistakes, but too few to be statistically significant. It's important that when we evaluate events in the present, we don't fall for the temptation of adopting narratives that belong in the past. Facts are what they are, and we should follow them wherever they may lead.</TEXT>

    <TITLE>Tottenham Hotspur could finish 4th and still miss out on Champions League qualification.. again.</TITLE>
    <DATE>2018-04-29 18:21:03</DATE>
    <TEXT>in 2011/12, Tottenham reached the 4th and final Champions League spot, but they were denied qualification by Chelsea who got through by winning the trophy, at a time when 4 teams per league was the limit. The limit has since been lifted to 5, but this could happen again. Arsenal are mathematically out of the top 4 race, and still in the Europa League - winning it would grant them a spot Liverpool are 3rd could potentially be leapfrogged by Tottenham and Chelsea to finish 5th; meanwhile, they have one foot in the Champions League final. if both teams win their respective european cups and finish outside the top 4, Tottenham would pay the price and be excluded. For the second time. When it's never happened to another English team. Wouldn't that be something!</TEXT>

    <DATE>2018-05-01 08:56:31</DATE>
    <TEXT>We all know that rule changes in football throughout history have tended to favor excitement in a game. The backpass rule, discriminating between active and passive offside, giving 3 instead of 2 points for a win... which means that this hypothetical I'm proposing can't be _that_ crazy. The advantage of this rule change is obvious: every team would start a game going for a goal, always. A disadvantage would be the increased difficulty for low level teams in earning points, since they couldn't park the bus when facing bigger teams. What would be other (positive and negative) consequences of this?</TEXT>

To this day they remain the only Venetian team to win the Serie A (1984/85) - that probably won't change for a long time. I personally hope Venezia and/or Cittadella replace them. And that Chievo stay up!</TEXT>

So the man knelt in front of the well, and spake his wish: "Please, enchanted well. Grant me the wish of death upon the man who betrayed me and took my wife". The well acknowledged the wish, and then said "I do want to know, if I may.. why did you come to me? The journey is treacherous, and many other wells sit on this land that could have granted your wish." The man, with resolute conviction, replied: "Living well is the best revenge".</TEXT>

    <DATE>2018-11-04 18:50:57</DATE>
    <TEXT>the under-1600 competition is a great opportunity to use your lower rated gems without having to contend with stacked opposition. If you have a POTW on your squad, it's also a decent earner.  #8203; You could stand to earn even more if you take advantage of a weird flaw in the regulation.. as you might know, level 2 teams are rated **below 1600.** However, this competition allows teams rated **1600 or lower**.  #8203; The upshot? If you field a team that's **rated exactly 1600**, you now earn level 3 rewards. Assuming you have a POTW on your squad, that's 3.5k GP per win as opposed to 2.7k.  #8203; Not bad! Wish I had learned it sooner.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>That's normal; all induction cooktops function like this. If I've turned on my cooktop and there is nothing on it - whether I've yet to put something on, or I've just removed it, an error flashes: E0. Functionally, I understand what it means. But what does it \*mean\* mean? Is it because arrays start at zero, and this, being the most common error, is the first one they coded? Or is it called E0, more literally, because there are zero compatible pots or pans for the plate to heat? Other numbered errors exist, which lends more credence to the array theory; however, the only other error I've encountered is E5, which suggests they're not ranked by frequency. I threw away the box this came in long ago; I'll never know.</TEXT>

    <TITLE>Tonight, people are lying about me.</TITLE>
    <DATE>2018-12-10 14:23:14</DATE>
    <TEXT>Tonight, people are lying about me. This was utterly predictable, and the reason someone like Donald Trump got elected. Maybe these fools will never learn the simple lesson I'm teaching: They are creating their own enemies. I'm a Centrist, and a Libertarian. I've said it dozens of times. Seeing how far the overton window has shifted left since 2016 and before, I would not be surprised to find myself seeking friendship and understanding from conservatives in the future. The former liberals, whatever they've turned into now as they drive farther and farther Left, are behaving like a witch-hunting cult. They want sacrifices. They conduct inquisitions. They are compelled to purify the world of sin. Whatever their game is, they need to be confronted and challenged. They tell me things like "we've found your Twitter," as if I should run, hide, ask for forgiveness for not kissing Hillary's ass, or thinking Bernie is the second coming of Christ. I knew they were going to do it. I also know what they're going to do tomorrow, and the day after. They're stale, predictable, small-minded, uninclusive, hateful, spiteful, masochistic bigots who try to show their worth through obedience to their dogma. They will punish people like me, who speak their minds and challenge them. This is a strategy to shut down dissent, because their beliefs and creeds (as with all cults) don't stand up to scrutiny and logic. Do not think. Do not challenge. Obey the teachings. I'm choosing to take the advice of a great teacher, Jordan Peterson, who says that we need to fight while we still can. Once the Far Left takes over, it takes a few tens of millions of deaths before anything changes. If you take nothing from my rant, listen to me once more: I'm a normal person.  #8203;</TEXT>

I had tried and failed to teach it to him, but the new skill he learned always cycled between Fighting Spirit, Captaincy and Penalty Specialist. With today's gift of 10 skill trainers I thought I could finally pull it off, but no dice. Is it simply impossible for him to learn this? I was able to do it with Buffon, who is also a Defensive Goalkeeper. Is it something more stats based? Buffon is worse than Oblak in every respect that should matter (low pass, lofted pass, kicking power). Anyone have any ideas?</TEXT>

Whether you're a "liberal" or a "conservative" in American terms, you tend to agree with those values.  #8203; You'll find that in Europe, the term "liberal" is mostly used by centrist or right of centre politicians, because socialism is mainstream (unlike in the US) and seen in opposition to liberalism on certain key aspects.  #8203; For more info, search "classical liberalism". Indeed, many conservatives in the US label themselves as such, because they believe "liberals" in America are trending towards socialism.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>The conversation on whether this version of the comic is "real" or "bootlegged" comes up a lot, and since this post is getting some visibility I should make it clear for everyone (being the creator of this comic series). This was the first iteration of the comic, that Kasper co-wrote and illustrated with yours truly (creator and writer). The comic as you see it on Line Webtoon is co-written and illustrated by a different artist named Corey, who in the beginning tried to recreate the style, then went on to make it look a little different (more cartoony, if that makes sense).</TEXT>

    <DATE>2020-08-13 06:17:14</DATE>
    <TEXT>This morning I launched PES and got greeted with a notice that my account is suspended for breach of terms of use. It's possible that it's because of me using a sider - though I only used it to change fonts and uniforms.. I've been using it for the past couple months without any problems, but it's true that recently some games got disconnected before they started. I did not believe it was the sider's fault because I had been using it for so long, and because it did not happen all the time - only about half the games. I did not act maliciously so I hope there's some recourse for me - has anyone had a similar experience? Thanks!</TEXT>
