    <TEXT>Thanks ! * I started bulking at 2.8-3k Cal for 2.5 months as I desperately need to gain weight, then reduced it to 2.4-2.7k Cal. As for protein, just follow the general rule of 0.8-1x weight. * Lift 5-6 times a week, normally a 2 day split where I do biceps,triceps,back,shoulder and then chest,abs,leg. Mon - biceps,triceps,back,shoulder Tue - chest,abs,leg Wed - Rest Thurs - biceps,triceps,back,shoulder Fri - chest,abs,leg Sat - biceps,triceps,back,shoulder Sun - Rest Mon - chest,abs,leg * Body fat might have increased by 3-5% as I gain 15 pounds for the first 2.5 months, which is quite a lot * First month is usually when your body starts adjusting, learning the correct form (at least that's what happened to me since I never lift previously), so don't be discouraged if growth are not that significant during the first month.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Rent in Sydney is very expensive compared to most country. Rent is 2600 a month (I paid 1170, rest is my roommate). Most student live in shared housing which I believe can be around 600-800 and can easily be covered by having a part time job (minimum wage is around $17 ph assuming you work in places where they record tax, ie not cash payment like some Chinese restaurant)</TEXT>

    <TEXT>For those wondering how is this a student apartment: * Almost all furnitures are from Ikea and some I got on 50% discount on their year end sale. * I have an online business since I was 13, and just stopped last year when I moved here to Australia, so I've been saving for a very long time * I also work part time since I was 14, and most of the money I got from my business and part time work are invested in mutual/managed funds * My parents are relatively good financially, so I can save most of my money during my teenage years. College tuition fee are also covered by them so I guess I'm very lucky with that * I live with my roommate (who is also a close friend of mine), and he is filthy rich, so most furniture are split two ways and he pays higher rent than I do * I also work part time currently in the finance department of a private company which pays well for a student</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Thanks for the write up. We do have more styles planned out, and currently just waiting to gain traction so we can fund the next collection, which is the challenge right now.  #8203; In regards to the marketing approach, totally agree with focusing on sales at the initial stages. However, at the moment, our challenge is how can we directly convert cold audience into customers ? Also, would you mind elaborating more on direct engagement ? Are you referring to just general social media contents ?  #8203; Yeah the Australian market do have huge potentials, which is why we're trying to grab a portion of the pie.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Thanks for the feedback !  #8203; Not sure why you didn't see the bot funnel (cause I tried using my mates and it showed up), perhaps because it's running on a very low daily budget ? It's only on $8/day atm since traffic is still very low  #8203; Tried split testing bunch of copies, creatives, audiences but never got proper return. Here's some example of some of the audiences and creatives : [https://imgur.com/a/FUglg0s](https://imgur.com/a/FUglg0s) There's 2/3x more than the ones in the album, but yeah that should give a very good idea  #8203; We've also placed url tracking for every campaign, but again, it's very obvious none of them provides proper return.  #8203; Normally I'd run ads at $30 a day, and reassess after 24h, if it is extremely bad (super high CPM or no clicks etc) then I'll kill them. If it is still acceptable, then let it run for 2-3 days, if no conversion then kill.  #8203; So far there's only one ad that provides conversions, but even that at a negative ROI. $24 for each ATC which is atrocious.  #8203; Would very much appreciate if you can have a look at some of the audiences and copies I linked above, not sure what is wrong since there is literally no single ads that is converting properly.  #8203;  #8203;</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Yeah that's what I thought as well. Didn't see anything wrong with the copies or photos to warrant a 3/4 relevance score and such low CTR which drives the conversion price up. Yup I did exclude the audiences you mentioned in some other ads, but probably not the early ones.  #8203; Audience size is mostly around 150-500k, since AU and NZ is pretty small to begin with. The reason I went with those 2 countries aside from the fact that we're based here, is that I simply can't see how to break through the noise in other countries if we can't even do it domestically (with free express shipping and afterpay which is huge for retailers here).  #8203; Well atm we don't mind simply breaking even for the ads, since we're in it for the long term and the LTV of a customer will definitely be worth it. In terms of purchase we're looking at around $40-45, Checkout at around $20 and ATC at around $5-8. These numbers are just approximate though from all the data that we've got right now, which again is still very very limited.  #8203; How long do you reckon an ads should run ? I do agree that 24h is a little early, but that is because we've never got any results from the other 4-5 ads that we kept running for days, and it's very easy to burn money through all this ads and testing.  #8203; As for video views, that's something we just recently set up, just so we can retarget those who viewed the videos more than 3s, since I completely ran out of ideas on what to do with the targeting.  #8203; Again, really appreciate the help here man, been really frustrated this past week trying to figure out what's wrong.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Just piggybacking of this comment so it doesn #8217;t get lost. I think it #8217;s important to not have unrealistic expectations. While I do work very hard to get here, I wouldn #8217;t have been able done it without the support I get from family. I started saving and investing very early (parents put me through business seminar camp when I was 12, while everyone there was 18-21 :D). Also started a business when I was 13 which grew to a team of 5, and close it off on third year of uni to focus more on study, career and just life in general. On top of that, having no student loans definitely helped, parents help fund me throughout my study (I still have to work for rent and living cost but that #8217;s very achievable). I hope this helps. And I believe there #8217;s still long way to go for most of us, 20s, 30s and even 40s is still young, still so much we can do, plus everyone has different goals, so just take the bright side and inspiration off this sub and modify it towards our own personal goal, because we all live a unique and different lives, not comparable to one another :)</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Totally agree with your sentiment. I find that context have to be put in place when judging a design, be it interior or architecture. Obviously if this is in a rural area, then design wouldn't make any sense, but in Toronto, where land prices are crazy expensive, I find this space to be very well designed.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I find this quite interesting as well. I've noticed a lot of the 'luxury' or 'cold' places (some I personally like since I'm into minimalist designs) actually gets lots of upvotes but all the 'negative' comments. At the same time, I've posted some that're 'warmer' or more standard relatable places but never turned out to be as popular albeit with more positive comments. I guess with design, since there's so many to choose from and we all have our preferences, the more extreme it goes in one direction, the more love/hate it gets from both ends of the spectrum.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Just wanted to chime in here, so this is designed by Cecconi Simone (a privately owned firm based in Toronto who has won multiple international design awards and employs 40 staff), in Toronto alone they've designed more than 75 condominium communities. The photographer, Shai Gil, has also won multiple awards in the architecture photography and is often used by many Canada's leading design firm. You can look both of those yourself if interested. This particular project is the most recent and is meant to be released by press/media first. Not trying to dismiss anything but just wanted to give appreciation to the designers and photographers.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I do understand why it feels like rendering. Although nowadays, I find it to be a bit of a blurred line, renderings are now more photorealistic, and photographs seems to become more like renderings. Most of the time, the final images that are being used are edited to perfection, to better translate the architects vision. There's also some things such as removing exit signs or fire alarms, which is almost like a standard practice in the industry. I guess it all depends on the architect/photographers, some do try to show or leave the imperfections, while others just leave all them out at once. Personally, I neither agree/disagree, although a little bit of imperfection wouldn't hurt to give a more human touch and honest representation.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>It #8217;s a type of residential architecture. Usually built in bricks (most common red or liver colored) and to lesser extent weatherboard or timber. Also some other common features such as gables roofs with shingled details and bay windows among others. Yes it is popular in Australia #8217;s east coast, especially in the 1920s. Due to influence of Hollywood and similar climate with California. Now, one the reason there #8217;re still many houses like this is due to Heritage Overlay, which is a planning scheme to protect sites that have heritage value. Hence why the outside facade must be kept the same.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I get it mate, but try look at it from a slightly different perspective. We each have our own goals, life, community, which are different from others. While often times we can #8217;t help but to compare with others, it #8217;s good to remind ourselves that we each have our own path. Most of us I believe still have a long way to go, 20s, 30s and even 40s is still young, still so much we can do. Just make sure to enjoy the journey and do our best so there will be no regrets, in the end, I believe things will work out, one way or another :) Take the bright side of this sub, take inspiration, and modify it towards our own personal goal or maybe, use it as a fuel, something to aspire to one day.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>As far as I know there're several reasons behind it. The 'blur' is to not make the person in the image as the focus, the photo is about architecture, not people. That said, the people sometimes help create a desirable ambience, or in other cases it gives the building/space context and scale. I'm sure there are all sorts of other reasons as well. Perhaps someone who's an architecture photographer or architects here can comment on more.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Thanks for pointing it out. Never seen this one before hence I posted it. Upon recheck on the FAQs:  gt;Reposts are allowed, but only if the original post is at least 3 months old, and not currently in the top 100 submissions of all time.  gt;  gt;Reposts are especially encouraged if the original post was missing information in the title (such as the image resolution or photographer), or had less than 100 upvotes.  #8203; There was missing information (photographer) in the previous post, and it is over 2 years old although it is in top 100 as well. I guess this falls a little on the grey area, so I'll leave it for now and see if majority of the community are okay with it or not.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>While I agree that many times practicality is often sacrificed, I don't see how it can be concluded that three bedrooms meant six people living in the house. Often, one of the bedroom are unused, only for guests, especially in a family house with small kids like this one. The two bedrooms also look to have storage (one full length, and one with two smaller wardrobes), while the one with single beds (presumably kids room), might not have built-in but a dresser can always be installed anytime. There's also a full size cabinet just beside the oven (and built-in fridge), drawers all over the kitchen (top and below), drawers in both bathrooms, smaller drawer just right beside the fireplace, and of course, wardrobes in the bedrooms (which are not part of the shots taken; shown in floor plan).</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I bought the console table used as I don't see the benefit of buying new. But you can find it from Fantastic Furniture, the [Monaco Entertainment Unit](https://www.fantasticfurniture.com.au/Categories/Living-%26-Dining/Living-Room/Entertainment-Units/Monaco-160cm-Entertainment-Unit/p/MOCETU2DRMK2TBMMAB). As for the floor stand I bought it from [Amazon](https://www.amazon.com.au/FITUEYES-Swivel-Height-Adjustable-TT107501MB/dp/B07DJ32DYK/) as I'm renting the place and don't want to go through the hassle of repairing the walls but still wanted the TV to look like it floats and ability to swivel.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Nah that #8217;s a replica I got for about $500. The dining table and chairs are something I #8217;ve always wanted to change, but never did as they work just fine. And yes Roborock is so worth it. No fuss, keeps the house clean.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Very well actually, can even climb easily to objects like the bar stool base. And yes it goes everywhere I want it to. The app is pretty good overall, once it scans your place it'll show a map and you can highlight areas that you want it to clean, or just let it clean the whole place. Never really had issue with it playing "stupid", perhaps once or twice but that is due to the sensor being dirty, or filter needs cleaning etc. Granted, there's no stairs on my apartment so not sure how it'd fare on multistorey houses/unit.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>It's actually a Corsair T2 Road Warrior chair. I find it to be on the firm side, so it's okay, but not the best for me personally. Got it way back before all this working from home; would probably get something more ergonomic if I were to choose now. Guess it's preference as some people prefer the firm build, just like buying pillow.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I've got no problems with it as the light sits above the barely used corner of the dining table. The arch itself is  gt;2 meters high and the base sits below the kitchen island so it doesn't really get in the way.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>* Yes I agree it looks a bit unbalanced. Would swap the dining set but every time I was about to do that, sit on the dining area, works just fine, then decided to keep it. * My girlfriend moved in with me before the whole COVID thing so setup a small desk for her to use occasionally. * Great idea on painting the tv mount! Never thought of that before.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>The reason I got this one is because the unit is rental, and I want sort of a pendant light above the dining table. The arch is really tall so it's not obtrusive, and the base sits in the corner under the kitchen island.</TEXT>
