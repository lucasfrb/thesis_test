    <TITLE>Help using R. Pika?</TITLE>
    <DATE>2016-04-24 20:33:30</DATE>
    <TEXT>So I basically need help against ranged characters plus blaziken. I got to C1 somewhat easily, but now I'm stuck because I'm always paired up against braixen, chandelure, gardevoir, Mewtwo, SM2, and blaziken. All of them except blaziken just zone me into oblivion. How do I go against that?? Chandelure is especially bad. Now blaziken just has his bs of fury. It's just constant attacks to the point where my shield breaks, or my CA is pierced. I'm basically relieved if I'm paired up against another R. Pika or a pikachu, lucario or machamp. At that point, along with garchomp, weaville and charizard (who I suck against, but I at least feel is a fair loss), I actually feel like I'm playing against players that use skill rather than cheap gimmicks to win (no offense to zoning players, but we all know there are people who play to the bs extremes). Any help would be appreciated. Thanks!!</TEXT>

    <TEXT>That works really well! To be honest, I personally preferred the +4 defense buff, since he tanks mages well as is with the natural +7 on the upgraded weapon. Gives him the same natural defense as Camus with much higher res. Then throw bonfire on him because his defense will end higher than his res, and put distant defense on him. The rest of your skills besides iceberg are spot on with my build, but +res works super well too :)</TEXT>

    <TEXT>+atk -spd Berkut's Lance (+res refinement) Reposition Bonfire/Ignis DC QR Threaten defense/attack Distant Defense/Deflect Missle This makes him a great overall tank and even mage killer. He survives almost everything (neutral IVs and no skills though) except Sonya. Obviously it changes with skills, but he still mostly survives except for green mages, and he can even kill most of those if planned correctly. I hope that made sense haha. I have been running it and it's great! It's like Infantry berkut almost.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Mine is currently +atk -res, so I'm waiting for one that is -spd. Currently his atk is 53, spd 22, def 38, and res 17. Defense is 38, then add 2 for azura which, 2 for summoner support, and 1 or 2 for ally support which brings him to 43 or 44. Then add 6 if against bows or daggers. Also factor in threaten attack if you decide to go that route instead of threaten defense. Res goes up 7 when defending, and DD gives him another 6 on top of that, bringing it to 30 on defense phase. Bring Azura in with Drive res and her dance, that brings it up to 35. Add a summoner support, 37, and ally support is like 38 or 39 (I forget how much it boosts). And that's with a Res boon.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>The base is 29 for +spd, but after LnD, +3 speed seal, B!Lucina's +3 speed for her weapon and +3 for drive speed, plus abother 1 or 2 for ally support, he goes up to 44 or 45 speed depending on the placement of the ally. And I probably wont, but if I ever do, SS support would bring that up to 46 or 47 speed. -1 if I use swift sparrow. Both of these would only go on a windsweep build. But that's why I'm wondering if death blow would be better than that.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Maybe because a lot of the older FE games are harder to come by these days? SS was my first FE game only because of the Nintendo Ambassador thing for buying a 3ds early.

    <TEXT>It's just if you decide to run that build. I'm still debating on it personally because mine is +spd, and I have an Eirika who can do a great job buffing him and getting his speed in the 40's while covering his green weaknesses. Other than that instance, I would say speed is okay, he's getting doubled by most anyways and you want to keep his defenses.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I think it could work! I have a very similar build with my Lukas. It works amazingly well (even better considering my Lukas is currently -res). So if it works on him, it'll definitely work on Ephraim. Just make sure to throw the Distant Defense seal on him instead of the Def +3. And if you have P!Azura, she synergizes really well because of her Drive Res as well as her dance to increase his overall stats by 2 (plus ally support).</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I'm sure it's been floated around a lot, but I think a good idea for those who are p2p would be like, for every $30 or $50 spent or whatever, you get a guaranteed hero of your choice from the banner you're pulling with neutral IVs. It would increase the number of people who buy orbs I would think (since it takes away the discouragement from those who talk about how they spent hundreds and don't get the unit they want). Just a thought. I think it's fair, and would make all parties involved happy.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I will say, I use eirika as his main buffer, but Ephraim is no longer a buffer (although he still gives the +3 atk from Siegmund). I have +spd boon, SS for +4 speed, Speed seal 3 for +3 speed, eirika with hone and drive speed for an additional 7 speed, ally support with eirika for an additional 1-2 speed. That puts him at 44-45 speed. Add summoner support and hes at 46-47. He's doubling almost everyone, or killing them in one hit. And Eirika needs to know reposition so she can save him from those pesky greens around the corner.</TEXT>

Otherwise, it synergizes really well with nidhogg, especially since you should always have at least one person stuck on him like glue. He's one of, if not my best mage baiter/killer</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Could I answer, and then ask you a couple questions too? :) I don't speak Japanese so I'm unable to ask your community myself. 1: It depends, personally I'd only do that if I like a character from their original game. For example, I'd raise Alm and Hinoka over similar stronger characters because I love their art AND I love their characters in their games. From what I've seen, this holds true for a lot of people, but people who have never played other fire emblem games may just raise characters with good art in general. 2: A little less than I'd use loved characters. I'll raise a character if they're really good, but I wont make them among my best. Good stats help my teams, but I don't like using them because they might not be characters I know. For other people though, it seems that if a character has high stats, they will raise them regardless of whether or not they like the character in order to have a better team. 3: I think it's a cool idea, but they need to make them not as strong, and choose more characters than from Awakening and Fates. 4: I'm not a fan of Alfonse and Shareena, but I like Fjorm and Sutr. However, I don't care too much about them. I think they're cool, but they need more character development before I can care too much about them. As for my questions: 1: Which characters are the most popular in Japan? If you had to name the top 5 characters? 2: Are characters like Camilla popular in Japan? The ones that are more naked, even if they don't have a lot of personality? 3: Does voice acting affect how much you like a character? 4: Is Shadows of Valentia/Gaiden popular? And if so, which character is most popular from it? 5: Was your community angry about the way Ayra was released? And are they currently unhappy that Eirika was released with Knoll's tome? Or is that just us being whiny children? If you don't answer the questions it's fine, I know you have a ton of responses, but thanks!</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Wouldn't it be best to do both? Like lets say to get to level 40, it takes 40 enemies (unrealistic I know, just an example). I fight all 40 today and get 1200 sp. Then I fight just 40 more over the weekend and get an additional 2400 sp on top of the original 1200 for 3600 total, compared to just 2400. Would it still be more worth it to just do it over the weekend? Not arguing, just curious.</TEXT>

I don't think it would cut into is's sales at all because I know personally, I don't go out of my way to summon reds just for fury, I just kind of get it if I happen to be pulling reds for a banner character. I don't know if they would include premium skills like wrath or swift sparrow or the like since people do actually summon colors specifically for those skills.

    <TEXT>After a few days of using both decks now, I can kind of pretend like I actually know what I'm talking about now. The Mach Strike deck is great, it's well rounded, definitely a solid choice. However, it can be a bit slow to start up at times. As for destruction fang, you can almost always apply pressure right from the start. Got salandit to start? You probably also got an ultra ball or some support card to help you bring out salazzle, so that's one energy card to provide 80 damage per turn. I win a lot of matches within 2 or 3 turns of starting just because of that alone. Hydreigon is also no joke, and more useful than garchomp imo based off raw power alone as well as type advantages against psychics. He can be a bit harder to bring out though since none of them have ascendence (or whatever move gible and gabite have to bring out garchomop). There is also no cynthia type card to make hydreigon's power double. But again, a good anti psychic deck. This deck also has a fighting weakness which can be a problem against mach strike, which as you said, 90% of people run. Luckily the deck revolves around garchomp who does not have a type advantage over dark. Overall, I much prefer destruction fang due to the constant pressure you can apply. Of course, there are garbage starting draws like any other deck that will just screw you over, but the chances of that happening in this deck are much lower than all the others. I've won several tournaments just based on this fact alone, and consistently beat other decks even with a weakness to fighting (unless they get lucky very early). I hope this helps! And isn't too late if you decided to invest in it.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>For sure! I've entered 5 tournaments and have gotten in the bottom 2 once, 2nd 2 times and 1st 2 times. I highly recommend it, and you rarely have to face other DF since there are so many MS, which I mostly win because the early pressure keeps them from setting up too well, and even when they do, Hyreigon, Houndoom and Salazzle are beasts. Getting a bewear early is also ridiculous since he's basically an anti-basic pokemon, or oranguru for the evolved ones. Side note: How are all the others? I've only gotten MS and DF, but have been wanting to make either an electric, steel or dark expanded deck with fairy so I've been having a hard time deciding.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Okay! Xurkitree has worked great for me so far because of that special energy thing. It's messed a lot of people up :) So if I decide to go with the Raichu line (less time to set up with less reliance on rare candies), should I drop Golem completely? Okay, thanks for the input on the trainer/support/item cards. Is Ultra Ball better than having nest balls and timer balls? Yeah I started working on that after seeing other comments. I'm still learning what the differences between the two are. Thank you! I really appreciate it. EDIT: If I focus on the Raichu line, how many pikachus and raichus should I have? And how many kokos?</TEXT>

Of course I need to save up for events to test it against really good people, but for now, I have won every single match in versus (knock on wood), so thank you! I went with 4-4 Raichu and 4 Kokos.

She has Natural Weapon, reposition, bonfire, Atk/Def bond (if you have it) QR Guidance (Switch to maybe goad fliers since she'll be wanting the additional hone/(especially) fortify) Close Defense Seal Just based on this set alone without flier buffs, she gets to 47 defense. Throw in ally support and she's at 49 defense on enemy phase :) then add the fortify buff for 55 defense, she tanks literally anything and everything physical (except emerald axe users). A monster for real, she takes no damage from majority of the cast with all of their buffs.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>In the game, he's driven by ambition and pride which makes him a more offense-seeming character, especially when he's possessed. I think his A skill should reflect that rather than being defensive, and same goes for his weapon (even though berkuts lance is a res lance) and special. I know current Berkut is defensive, and this Berkut would probs be tanky as well. I think personality-wise however, he should have offensive skills.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I would go Camilla, Hinoka, Azura and Caeda. Camilla is a no brainer, one of the staples of a flier team, and with flier buffs, the -atk iv won't matter a whole ton (although if you have the opportunity, try to get a better one, literally any iv that isn't -atk is better. She's still a beast though). Cordelia is technically "better" because of her speed, but Hinoka's refinement makes her better imo with proper set up, just make sure to have desperation on her, and be careful on counters since she needs her lance to be better than Cordy compared to the Firesweep/Brave build. Azura is a no brainer, I'm not gonna even explain it. Just please do WoM instead of her natural B skill, fortify fliers should be run and gives a better boost. Both Palla and Caeda are pretty meh, and Cordelia is still meh even with her new weapon, but it does make her better than Palla and gives her a specialty on your team, especially because cavs can still be a pain, and hector is still not fun to deal with, especially for flier teams. She solos hector which is her biggest thing, and kills a lot of cavs that aren't too tanky. I used her mainly as support and anti-hector and she worked great. Give her fortify fliers and she's good to go. I would wait for a better IV since she's 4 stars. You can either raise Palla without full investment to wait, or fully invest in Caeda and then just merge when you get a better one. With all of this said, if you get the chance to get H!Nowi, please do. I was questioning getting her before and not just waiting for a S!Camilla rerun, but she's crazy good with a bladetome, and easily the most useful red. Cherche is a really good replacement for green if you don't want to run double blade tome, and Minerva is good as well (I personally prefer Cherche for waifu reasons and her monster attack). She kills most things not red (but still does kill lowerish defense reds). Just run Brave Axe on her and she's a beast. I've had an evolving flier team since day 1 practically, so I can say all of this with experience (although never got S!Camilla and I feel I no longer need to).</TEXT>

    <TITLE>My EP Sacred Stones Mixed Team Build and Breakdown</TITLE>
    <DATE>2018-03-05 01:14:56</DATE>
    <TEXT>https://imgur.com/a/43EI3 It didn't start as a SS team, but it definitely ended that way when Myrrh was introduced. This is my very first team build post, soooo yeah. Not sure how that's relevant. But without further ado, here it is! **Tana: Winged Princess** *IVs*: +Def -Res *ALLY SUPPORT*: Innes/Summoner because ~~(waifu for laifu)~~ she benefits most from the buffs in my opinion as the lead physical tank on this team). *WEAPON*: Vidofnir Wait what happened to the firesweep/brave build? Pfft, who needs that with these fantastic IVs. Base 29 defense (+4 for supports) +7 on EP? Sign me up for that 40 defense before buffs and skills. The best offense is the best defense. Without Vidofnir, she becomes another Cordelia/Hinoka. Vidofnir is clearly the superior choice for a lance in my opinion, and I will fight any of you who say otherwise. *ASSIST*: Reposition Works great with her partner in crime Innes, as he can jump in front of her to tank/kill an enemy mage, then reposition him away afterwards to allow her to take physical damage. More Innes shenanigans later. *SPECIAL*: Bonfire Who doesn't want all of the extra damage that Bonfire can produce with her monstrous defense? Easily the best choice of a special here as it can add anywhere from 25-28 damage on enemy phase. All added defenses will be explained later. Can be switched for moonbow, but it's such a waste. Bonfire is really the only way to go. *A SKILL*: Atk/Def Bond Her two most important skills as a tank, and if she's always next to her brother, why not take advantage? This adds an additional and crucial +5 to both attack and defense, bringing her attack to 59 and defense up to 45 (from the value explained earlier). "What if Innes isn't there" some of you simple-minded fools might ask. The answer is he is ALWAYS there. "But what if---" HE IS ALWAYS THERE YOU AUDACIOUS ANTELOPE. But for the sake of argument, any unit can be thrown next to her for the +5 bonuses, she just loses out on the +2 to all stats from ally support. Can switch out for sturdy stance if needed as it's only a 1 stat point drop in attack and defense, but you lose any sort of player phase potential with that as it only applies on defense. *B SKILL*: Quick Riposte Tana is ~~lightning fast~~ meh at 36 base speed (40 after supports), which in today's meta, is enough to double slow tanky units, and enough to not get doubled by fast units. Throw QR on there and she doubles everyone while only getting doubled by a select few units and speed buffed teams. If they're physical, non-emerald axing and non-bowing, she walls all of them anyways. Can switch for lancebreaker or guard, but neither are nearly as successful as QR. *C SKILL*: Guidance "But you have reposition! Isn't that redundant??" Well let me drop a little knowledge on you you redundant kumquat. It's not. Because of Guidance, my units (especially Innes) can guide their pretty little faces to ~~have surprise coitus in the rectum~~ explode in enemy ranks, and then repositioned to safety behind the wall named Tana. Can switch for a tactic depending on your team comp (res tactic could potentially work great). *SACRED SEAL*: Close Defense Pretty much a given. Stacks with her weapon effect to bring her defense to 51 with supports and no buffs, and resistance to a respectable 30 against manaketes. ***OVERVIEW***: She's a beast. With her defensive buffs from her teammates (explained soon), she gets +6 defense, bringing her total defense to 57 defense as long as she has Innes next to her. That's enough to tank any sword, lance, or axe user in the game without an emerald axe for minimal damage (usually between 0-3 damage). She also struggles against the garbage called Los Angeles Hector because of the wrath effect of armads. Because of the importance of Close Defense, she does die quickly to bows as well, so be wary of those darn things. Recommended for EP teams? 15/10, need to have her. Questions? Concerns? Confused by my unnecessary amount of parenthesis? Good, let's continue. **Innes: Regal Strategician** *IVs*: +Atk -Spd (Great boon followed by a sad bane. Still works wonders). *ALLY SUPPORT*: You will never guess because I was so cryptic before this, but it's TANA! SURPRISE! *WEAPON*: Nidhogg "But-but guard bow for tanking! Or brave bow for damage! Or firesweep because I hate Faye and wanted her dead asap!" Well first off, Faye is somewhat kind of-ish bae as long as your name is Alm, so leave her alone. Second, his build does not work without Nidhogg. Just by being next to Tana, he gets +2 to all of his stats for ally support, and another +2 to all stats because of the weapon effect. Think of it as a second summoner support. It also stacks depending on how many units he has next to him. Having just Tana next to him brings his attack to 54, his speed to a more respectable but still meh 35, and his resistance to 35 as well. Add +2 to each of those with every unit next to him. *ASSIST*: Draw Back This is to protect Tana from ranged attacks, or to move Innes out of range of a physical attacker, so it has saved the sibling duo many times. *SPECIAL*: Iceberg Same reason as Tana's bonfire special. He can do anywhere from an additional 15-25 (usually 23 if just with Tana) damage based on skills and number of allies next to him. *A SKILL*: Atk/Res Bond Again, these are the most important stats for Innes for this build. Attack +5 next to Tana's support brings his attack to 59 (no way, same as Tana, such wow), and his resistance to 40. This is easily the best skill for his A slot, but is an extremely expensive skill. Fortress Res can be used as an alternate if you want him to remain an EP unit, or can be switched to mirror strike if going for a player phase. I'm sure mirror stance will be coming out sooner or later as well, and that can be used as a more reliable +4 atk/res. "But---" NO BUTTS I SAID THEY WILL ALWAYS BE TOGETHER YOU SULKING CENTIPEDE. *B Skill*: Quick Riposte Innes's speed, even without the speed boon, is meh at best. This remedies that and basically lets him kill all ranged units on retaliation that either don't kill him first (melts against brave bows and really anyone fast due to his super low defense), or aren't named H!Henry or Boey. Even then however, IVs and number of units adjacent to him can completely change that. Other than those however, he tanks and kills EVERY SINGLE MAGE IN THE GAME. This includes The Reinhardt. QR is essential for this, and cannot be switched. Guard has been considered, and that's it. Just considered. QR is too important. *C SKILL*: Def Tactic Remember how Tana got that random +6 defense buff at the end of her analysis? It comes from this guy. He does not need defense himself as he dies against the majority of physical attackers, but the benefits of him adding it to the rest of the team are astronomical, especially as an enemy phase team. I cannot recommend this skill enough for him. Attack ploy or drive defense are alternatives, but Def Tactic should be at the top of your priority list if building him for a mixed team. *SACRED SEAL*: Distant Defense Really goes without saying, it brings his resistance up to 45 against mages, and 20 against bows and daggers. Deflect magic can work here as well, but Distant defense is much more important for his magical tanking. ***OVERVIEW***: Also a beast... with support As long as Tana is next to him and he's tanking mages, there are very few units better than Innes. The colorless aspect adds to his versatility as he doesn't need to worry about certain colors ruining his viability. He can also take a hit from a bow or dagger, but that's it, one hit. Unfortunately a lot are built with brave bows or really high speeds, which make him almost useless against them. He does survive much more if you "stack the box" with units around him, so that is always an option as well. Another aspect I really like about Innes is that he can also be used as an offense phase unit to either finish units off, or to just outright kill them with his high attack with Iceberg. All of his buffs apply to both phases except for distant defense, so he has no issues attacking melees from afar and then hiding behind Tana afterwards. He ORKOs a loooot of units this way, so it's fun to mess around with! Recommended for EP teams? 9/10 with support, highly recommend/ 5/10 without support, could find someone better. **Joshua: Tempest King** *IVs*: Neutral af *ALLY SUPPORT*: Myrrh *WEAPON*: Audhulma Grants Res +5, has killer weapon effect, what't not to like? His somewhat low attack makes Brave weapons inadequate, he loses out on some key stats with a firesweep, not to mention his speed, while pretty good, doesn't justify a firesweep sword. Wo Dao could be good as well, but why invest in that when Audhulma is great as is, and gives him his own unique weapon. Wo Dao can be used on many other units. *ASSIST*: Reposition I feel I'm explaining these too much, so it's just great on teams. Not much else to say other than that. *SPECIAL*: Iceberg With his weapon effect, Joshua's resistance jumps up to 33, which slightly edges out his defense, which makes iceberg the better choice. Moonbow can also work very well, I just felt iceberg gave a better damage output, especially with the killer effect of his weapon. *A SKILL*: Distant Counter A Hector died on the battlefield. He just lost a bet, so now Joshua has his Distant Counter. With his naturally bulky defenses and decent speed, he is a perfect candidate for DC. He tanks mages well with his 33 res and decent HP, and hits back hard with Iceberg. He also takes physical attacks well, just not as well as magical. Fury also works great as his A skill because of his well-rounded stats. It also helps him get into wrath range, speaking of which... *B SKILL*: Wrath I cried when I gave this to him because this build makes him my most expensive unit to date, but it was well worth it. Combined with his weapon effect, when under 75% hp, he's basically always proccing Iceberg. So he goes from a decent mixed tank to a powerhouse who kills anyone he touches (as long as they're not blue). He is also able to do this on offense since his bulk does not come from enemy phase effects of his skills/weapons. So he needs to tank a hit to start, then he can be both player and enemy phase when below 75%. Vantage, guard or windsweep would all work here as well, but not nearly as effectively. *C SKILL*: Defense Ploy His resistance is solid, but his attack is meh. This helps remedy that by lowering their defenses, setting up THE ENEMY for him or his teammates to kill. *SACRED SEAL*: Quick Riposte Even though his speed is decent, that's it. It's *decent*. To help out with that and to help with his tanking ability, especially while he's still pre-wrath range, QR will usually KO characters that aren't blue due to his slaying and wrath effects. ***OVERVIEW*** At first glance, especially when compared to the defenses of Tana and Innes, Joshua seems very underwhelming. However, his DC and Wrath combo make him a beast to use, and don't forget that he also benefits from Innes's defense tactic if they're close enough. He also gets a boost from being near Myrrh, which just increases his defenses even further. Recommend for EP teams? 7/10, somewhat-highly recommend. **Myrrh: Great Dragon** *IVs*: (+spd -res, ouch. At least she's not -atk or -def, and her ridiculous BST still makes her an amazing unit despite these IVs). *ALLY SUPPORT*: Joshua *WEAPON*: Great Flame 19 might weapon, built-in non-armor enemy only wary fighter (ish depending on their defense), AND refined dragon effect without the added special cooldown? Holy shit if you aren't jumping for joy about having this weapon (or crying if going against it), you have some serious issues. Easily one of the best weapons in the game even without the built-in DC, which would just make it broken. Can replace with lightning breath I guess? But you're missing out on so much, and everyone going against you will probably judge you... forever. *ASSIST SKILL*: Reposition Yawn. Nothing special here, next. *SPECIAL*: Bonfire Without defense tactic adding to it, her defense sits at 36 (38 after ally support), which is quite bulky, and a considerable amount higher than her 28 (30 with support) res with a res bane. She already has strong attack, so adding bonfire on top of that just sends her attack to insane levels. Moonbow or glimmer can be used alternatively, with moonbow having the edge over the two. However, I feel you'd be missing out on so much damage if you switch. *A SKILL*: Distant Counter Her weapon doesn't come with DC, doesn't mean you can't throw it on her! She is easily one of the best DC users in the game, especially with her refined dragon effect. Everyone going against her will have to think twice before attacking her head on. She is also unable to have breath skills, which makes the decision for her A slot super easy. *B SKILL*: Quick Riposte Even with her +spd boon, her speed is... forgettable. She's being doubled by units with 34 or more speed, which is a lot of characters, especially red units who are able to obliterate her manakete...butt... So QR is taken to fix that as she should mainly be used on defense phase anyways. *C SKILL*: Atk Tactic So to start, I know she could use the +6 attack for herself, as 52 attack is pretty darn good, but could be better. However, remember that she is EP and gets the refined dragon effect, which powers her up a tooon (against ranged units). Joshua, Innes and Tana could all use the boost more than her to ensure their KOs. She could also work well with ploys (with different IVs) or smokes to help the entire team tank even better. *SACRED SEAL*: Iote's Shield We can't have our favorite flying manakete shot down by arrows can we? The flying unit part of her is great for terrain, but Iote's is almost necessary on her as her refined manakete weapon applies to ranged units. Guidance can work here as well to support the team even more, but may be redundant since Tana already has it, and Iote's is more important. ***OVERVIEW*** Myrrh is a beast. There's no other way to say it. She's the anchor/clean-up crew of the team as it seems she never dies. Her great mixed bulk, combined with her great weapon effect and strength makes her a force to be reckoned with. Recommended for an EP team? 9/10, highly recommend. ***OVERVIEW FOR THE TEAM*** I have each type of emblem team: Armor, Horse, Flying, and Infantry, and I have to say that this is easily my best team. They consistently win in arena and score between 698-706, which is higher than any of my other teams (I don't have extras to merge :(). The only drawback is that this team struggles in chain challenges because of it's lack of a healer (rip healer L'arachel), but who needs a healer when the entire team is taking no damage in the first place? Playing smart and with correct positions makes that extremely possible with this team. I'm really proud of it, and what better theme than Sacred Stones right?? Thanks for reading! I hope it makes any sense at all as this took forever to type up, and I'm open to answering questions about your units Tana/Innes/Joshua/Myrrh/Mixed teams as well to the best of my ability.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I was considering both Ephraims (regular and L) as well as Eirika (regular and SM), but since I wanted to make it purely enemy phase, I switched it up. I can always use the others on other teams because they're all pretty beast. These units just synergize so well together, they can't function without each other basically, which is a gift and a curse for arena haha since they're not always all bonus units. How is sturdy stance and aether on tana? Does she have any sort of killer effect on her?</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Yeah for sure! Like it's definitely not a bad bane, I would just of course prefer attack or defense, but speed is good as well :) Haha it's tough to merge her, especially because of her guidance C skill. Even though it's a seal, it's still a valuable C skill to have. So you went more offensive, does that mean you don't have her prf on her? Is it really? How does she charge it in a reasonable time though is the scary part since she doesn't have a slaying effect at all.</TEXT>

I do have an Amelia that can technically replace her, but I'd lose out on so much for this team if I take her off of it. You should definitely try it! She's the same as the other two fliers, but slightly better, so you should get on that. Hm interesting, I'll have to try it out when I get enough feathers for aether. Thanks :)</TEXT>

    <TEXT>A waste imo, his speed isn't that great. Windsweep does much better on Sothe if you want a dagger unit, and he doesn't use dew. Something my brother did (I saw a video of a GHB solo clear with a similar build as well) if you want to invest in Jaffar is Close Counter, Vantage, Savage Blow. He's serviceably tanky as a dagger (usually enough to survive at least one phase of combat of taking damage). Then it's constant, ridiculous damage for the rest of the match because of vantage. Just a thought! It's insanely good, but obviously very reliant on chip damage and actually getting him into vantage range.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Hi! Thank you for doing this, this is obviously a topic and area that a lot of people need assistance with. So for my question, I do great when talking to people one on one, I do great when addressing a large group of 15 or more people, but I tense up and become completely silent and awkward when in groups of 3 - 14ish, so like snall to mid sized groups. It's a problem because I'm in nursing school, so for interviews and just dealing with patient families, I need to of course be able to talk to small groups more than I need to talk to very large groups. Do you know why this happens? And anything I can do to help it?</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Howdy! So I've been messing around with ideas and whatnot (dangerous I know), and while looking through my flier team and trying to see how to improve it, I started wondering, which flier units are good on their own regardless of their team? NY!Azura is a given because of her dancing ability, and Minerva and Cherche stick out in my mind as well. Who else can you think of?</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Speed would kind of be a pseudo-defense skill, maybe even better than a defense one depending on who you throw it on to prevent a double. I don't see why we wouldn't get it, they're just waiting to put it on a character that it fits, just like speed tactic. I don't think we'll see another breath skill until we either get another Ike alt, or when the new CYL heroes drop. Maybe like death breath for Ephraim or darting breath for celica, but that's being optimistic, I doubt it.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I personally think Clair. They are both so weak that that extra +1 goes a long way, she beats annoying red and blue armors (assuming she attacks first) loses to greens but there are more than enough reds in the game to cover those, and beats all blue and red cavs (again, assuming she attacks first), but loses to all non-mage greens, but that's like, freddy, alfonse and titania, soooo not really an issue to deal with with other characters.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Majority of fliers are definitely offense oriented, so I wouldn't think about sustain and more about Ohkos. My current team is H!Nowi, Cherche, Cordelia and NY!Azura, and I will say having hone fliers as well as a mage bladetome flier is essential. Nowi Ohkos everything she touches except super res tanky blues, and cherche comes in to clean them up. Neither are tanky but are insanely good player phase units. I'm personally not too big a fan of using L!Robin as her general stats are all around, but realistically not great. I like having units with a given role and sticking to it, not a one size fits all kind of character. And her attack is a bit on the lower side imo. Elincia is great, even better with db and hone fliers support. Just make sure she has hit and run so you can reposition her away. Hinoka is great as well, but I think bladetome mages do her job well enough with hone and fortify on them, I think hinoka works well on a non-flier team also, a mixed team would be great with her I've honestly never looked into Minerva since I dont have one so I dont have any feedback on her, but I like cherche! If shes anything like cherche, shes amazing. If you want tanky fliers, myrrh is definitely the way to go. I have her on a different team, and basically nothing except red kills her with qr, iotes and aether.</TEXT>

Elincia if you're feeling ballsy, but I think moonbow works better on her and cherche. For last one you can probs go WF!Hinoka.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>IS is a Japanese country though, so even if loli culture isnt popular here, it is there. It's acceptable for them to make something based on their own culture. Knowing that the same thing isnt popular here, they made that voice line to patch it up. People are going nuts over her being in this banner in the first place already, regardless of the line, and people ARE assuming the worst already. So I think the voice line helps, not hurts.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Oh no! a Japanese company is following Japanese culture and we dont like it because the world revolves around our own culture, so even though they brought it here and made it more normal than shes probably portrayed in Japan, let's all hate it and call it a sex symbol instead of thinking of her as a kid dressing up in a wedding dress.

    <TEXT>Not trying to accuse them, but I went in today with about $200 in a pocket inside of my bag incase my wallet got stolen. I didnt think it's an issue because I basically never take my bag off or anything, i carry it all day. I went through bag check where security asked me to step ahead to go through a metal detector thing while they searched my bag. So I did, thought nothing of it, whatever. Then I went through my day and bought something, but realized I was short money in my wallet, so I went in my bag to grab my extra money and bam, all gone. How do I proceed? I keep thinking and there is literally no where else it could be as the pocket hasn't been opened since putting the money in, and occasionally to check on it.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>The battlefield one is a flat field with 3 raised platforms - 1 to the left, 1 up above, and 1 to the right. I personally think this one is good for 4 player smash. It keeps everyone somewhat close together so it doesnt end up being two separate 1 on 1 fights. The final destination is just a flat stage with no raised platforms. Also personally, I think this one is better 1 on 1. So to answer your question, the battlefield version is better imo.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>You can (as far as I know). Still personally working on unlocking them myself because work has kept me from playing too much, but from my experience, do the vs thing until it stops, and then you can do classic.

    <TITLE>Glitch where Pokemon repeatedly break out of balls quickly?</TITLE>
    <DATE>2019-04-12 08:46:52</DATE>
    <TEXT>So back during the spring equinox event, I had a 45 minute period where I would attempt to catch a Pokemon, the ball would not even finish shaking once and would break out, and the Pokemon would run away. Every. Single. One. One of the ones I missed out on was a shiny Solrock because of it. Restarting the app didn't fix it, logging in and out didn't fix it, and it ended up just passing after 45ish minutes. I dropped the issue because while I would have loved to add another shiny to the collection, it wasn't the end of the world for a Solrock. Fast forward to my EX-raid today where I fought and beat Deoxys and was trying to catch it. I hit it with probably 80% of my balls, at least half of those were greats or excellents. Every single ball would not even finish the first shake, then it would break out. I would understand if this were a tougher legendary, but with Deoxys's catch rate, I find this unlikely.  #8203; Anyone else have this problem? Should I contact support? I doubt they would just gift me a Deoxys.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Working in the medical field (RN, not MD), I can say that ALMOST all (I'd be lying if I said the old fashioned doctors do) doctors that I have worked with have done extensive research on their own regarding vaccines because of (instagram posts? Really?) posts like this and continuous accusations of not knowing enough about vaccines due to not being taught in school. You don't need to learn everything in school to do your own independent research. You do however, need to be educated and understand how disease, medications, physiology, etc, work before jumping into scientific articles that discuss these very topics and the effects (or lack of) that vaccines play. Doctors go through extensive education in these topics, and from there, are able to do their own independent research on vaccines as a result. If anything, nursing school taught me how to look for evidence-based research and to sort through articles. I dont want to be encouraging harmful medications to my patients, and the doctors I know are even better at it due to their increased responsibility and liability for ordering medications, as well as the fact that they need to be constantly updating themselves on the latest medical practices to find the best ways to treat their patients.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Interesting way to twist my words when you have no other counter-argument. Never did I once say you are not allowed to, nor that you need to stop. Just that it is wrong, not sure how that is control. To actually add to our original discussion before you decided to take it this direction for whatever reason, I personally (again, I'll admit no sources, just personal experience), I didnt see people have an issue when it was the "Wuhan virus" until recently when "Chinese virus" started to be used. It originated in the city of Wuhan. That would keep it consistent with other disease names such as Norovirus, Lyme disease, and the Zika virus. However, when Trump started saying Chinese Virus, it just all became a racist type of thing and so it wasnt until AFTER he called it that that Wuhan virus started becoming an issue because the damage had been done at that point. So again, going back to our ORIGINAL discussion before you decided to change the subject, do you see the point of view as to why it is considered racist?</TEXT>

    <TEXT>...I'm a failure at reddit and a failed millenial so idk how to quote your responses, but I'll organize it as best I can. Calling people a bitch is "wrong", but I do it anyways. It's not being deemed racist or sexist or any type of issue other than derogatory, but at least it's an all inclusive derogatory term. What you are saying, whether you agree with it or not, is being deemed as racist. And last I checked, being racist is wrong instead of just being mean. That's where the differences are. Because I dont even know who the hell Dr. Lemon is, and no I didnt see that video, but thanks for the link. I didnt even start caring about this Chinese virus thing until one of my patients requested a different nurse because I'm Chinese and "it's his fault that damn Chinese virus is here". I can also guarantee that my very far right leaning girlfriends parents have never seen or heard of him, but theyve definitely heard of Trump. And they worship his every word basically, so if hes saying it, you can bet that they say it now too. Do they mean it to be racist? Of course not. They're good people, they mean well. But they are feeding into the problem without realizing it. I'm trying to have a discussion and answer your questions/points as well, but I have to ask a question at the end every time per the subreddit, so you can pretty much ignore my: Does this help you have some insight as to why it is being deemed as wrong? EDIT: Forgot to answer your last question. CNN is trash and any Democrat who disagrees with that is also trash.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>That would make sense as to why I have no idea who he is. I avoid CNN like the plague at this point. I have not admittedly watched it at this point as I am out at the moment and unable to watch clips. I will at some point tonight though. I agree, but that is the type of damage that calling it the Chinese virus is doing. Do I believe that you, as an individual, are racist? I dont know you so I have no clue tbh. But I'm working under the premise that you arent and dont actually mean any harm when you call it the Chinese virus. But it does have long spreading effects that you yourself arent seeing as evidenced as my asshole patient. I understand trump didnt invent the word, but if hes saying it, it doesnt matter who "started it". He is the president of the US, his message is inevitably gonna get to more people than Dr. Lemon or any other CNN anchor. Do you who what is this a question?</TEXT>

    <TEXT>First off, please at least wait until we can adequately test en masse. I understand that the economy needs to reopen or else everything will go bankrupt and homelessness will increase and everything. Waiting for a vaccine which isnt projected until next year is not realistic. 1+ years of quarantine is way too long and there will basically be no recovery from that long term. But for real, we need adequate testing. If we can adequately test the population, I'd be more for opening the economy right now. Second, we need more PPE. No matter what side of the spectrum you are politically unless you're a religious Trump follower, you have to agree there is a critical PPE shortage that the federal government not only refuses to rectify, but also refuses to acknowledge. I'm an RN and have 1 N95 mask to use for 3 shifts. I just have to hope it's not contaminated in my exposed little brown paper bag in that entire time period. And I consider myself lucky since I know many hospitals dont even get the 1 that I have. And lastly, people need to be alive for the economy to reopen. No people = no economy. The numbers and official counts are over reported in some areas, under reported in others, and unknown in most due to testing shortages, so while so much is unknown in terms of ACTUAL non-biased reporting of cases and deaths, we really do need to be wary of how quickly we reopen. Yeah... that's all I've got. Coming from a liberal, I'm not anti-conservative at all as my fiance is conservative and we talk about topics from time to time. But this virus doesnt need to be politicized. Lives first (testing, ppe), economy second. EDIT: Grammar</TEXT>

I am a lefty but I refuse to be brainwashed :) I think her question was loaded and aggressive, but a fair question which could have definitely been phrased better, as to when will testing be more available to Americans (I'm an RN, I find it an important question). While he seemed to avoid the question imo, it wasn't anything offensive that should have been blown up nearly to the level it was. And he has responded this way to multiple people, but all of a sudden there is an Asian-American who asked it and its racist to say the exact thing that he's been saying to people regardless of color.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Liberal here, I live in California which is very obviously a left leaning state, but there are quite a few red districts near where I live. Its 100% the opposite here, where the right is extreme unwilling to change their opinion on anything at all when leftists come to the table to civilly talk about topics. My best guess is that if you're a conservative living in a blue area, you're more willing to stick to your guns because you're tired of being told you're wrong or getting your opinion "fixed". And I would assume it's the same for liberals living in a red area.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I didnt mean this to be a debate, I apologize. You didnt sound sure in your original post, and my information was pretty hyperbolic as yours was as well. So I looked into it as well, but I didnt mean specifically voting districts as I'm not well versed on where these lines stop specifically. I meant sub districts within the city. For example, district 5 (could be wrong, this is info from google) is broken up into rancho bernardo, poway, rancho penasquitos, sabre springs, Scripps ranch, and some others. Rb is very liberal leaning and a pretty well populated area, skewing the "district 5" numbers heavily towards Democrat. Poway has always been republican, much less dense of a population but covers a bigger area, but the Republican party has lost a lot of support there since 2016, so while still republican, it's by a much smaller percentage. The districts/sub districts I was talking about was Scripps ranch which has always been red and is still just as red. There are no official numbers that I've seen since it's a smaller area (higher population density for a suburban area). This is hyperbolic because I dont see official numbers. Another district/sub district I was talking about was Coronado, which I will admit, has much less republicans than I was expecting as I've never met a liberal there. Granted, it's a tourist spot, so identifying the locals can be hard to do. San Marcos has also gone much more blue than I remember (I lived there for 10 years as a child to teenager), so they're pretty split now but blue leaning. Long story short, it was hyperbolic, but heres some info (kind of) on the areas I was speaking about, emphasis on Scripps since I'm there several times a week.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I work as an RN so I think I can answer this one. I live in San Diego. Currently, my hospital tests everyone that is admitted, regardless of whether or not they are presenting with covid symptoms (one is a nadopharyngeal test, the one where they look like they're shoving the q-tip to your brain which is used for symptomatic patients, and then nasal swabs which go to about the nose bone and that's it). At the start of the pandemic, for the entirety of March, we had 12 test kits total. Were the biggest hospital in the area, and we had 12 test kits. The people who were getting those kits I can guarantee are people that have for sure covid due to severe symptoms, they just need the confirmation from the test to start treating them as such. Same goes for new york. You guys were hit hard early, before tests were more widely available. Your hospitals tested the people that they were 90% sure had covid due to more severe symptoms while turning everyone else away. You guys also got the first surge of tests because of how early you were hit and the sudden spike of deaths in the state. But even with that, due to the huge population of new york, your hospitals could still only test people they were sure had covid, so you saw an increase in cases due to the number of tests you guys got, but the big majority of people that were being tested had more severe symptoms and more likely had a poor prognosis. Theres also that huge nursing home issue that Cuomo did (I'm a Democrat and I think that was the dumbest thing anyone could have done btw), which I'm sure surged cases and deaths even more.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I am posting this here for a discussion and to bring forth some statistics about the pandemic. This is not a  #8220;CORONAVIRUS HAS THIS MANY DEATHS AND ORANGE MAN BAD BECAUSE LOOK AT DEATHS #8221;. I don #8217;t even want this to really be political, other than the fact that the vast majority of people who don #8217;t think the virus is  #8220;that bad #8221; based on the national death rate, or wearing masks happen to be conservative. I understand not all conservatives believe in this either, so to those of you who also believe in social distancing and masks and everything, this post is not directed to you. I am posting this as a discussion for people who don #8217;t believe the coronavirus is  #8220;that bad #8221;, I would just like your point of view. Among both conservative and democratic sites, this is the most open-minded place that I see, so I would like to talk about it.  #8203; I #8217;ve done some research, I #8217;ve seen the posts about over-reporting cases/deaths in blue states, as well as underreporting in red states. So I present this graph to you asking you to please, DO NOT LOOK AT ANYTHING COVID RELATED as it has shown that both red and blue states are inaccurate in these counts, so official numbers mean nothing. Take a look at the pneumonia deaths. It #8217;s usually pretty clear cut if someone dies of pneumonia, the tests for those are pretty easy to do and to diagnose, so I want to go based off of those.  #8203; Based on this chart, from February 1st to June 27th of this year, there were 123,177 deaths in the United States where the primary cause of death was reported as pneumonia. Also based on the chart, this count is separate from anything COVID or influenza related. This does not list anything about comorbidities associated with it in any way, extra data, This is strictly deaths where pneumonia was identified as the primary cause of death.  #8203; I wish I had a state breakdown but I had looked and this was the best graphic I could find in general. And if anything, that would cause finger-pointing towards certain states and politicians, and that is not the type of discussion I think would be helpful.  #8203; Now take a look at this chart: [https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/pressroom/sosmap/flu\_pneumonia\_mortality/flu\_pneumonia.htm](https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/pressroom/sosmap/flu_pneumonia_mortality/flu_pneumonia.htm)[https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/pressroom/sosmap/flu\_pneumonia\_mortality/flu\_pneumonia.htm](https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/pressroom/sosmap/flu_pneumonia_mortality/flu_pneumonia.htm)  #8203; Unfortunately, the most recent chart that I could find only dates to 2018 and prior, so it #8217;s not exactly the most  #8220;up to date #8221;, but if you look through each year, it breaks down the number of deaths of pneumonia AND influenza (also could not find one that separates the two, so please share if you do have one). There is a general trend that you can follow if you add everything up per year.  #8203; I personally added everything up between 2016-2018, and what I got was: Entire year of 2016: 51,459 deaths in the US of Pneumonia AND Influenza Entire year of 2017: 55,593 deaths in the US of Pneumonia AND Influenza Entire year of 2018: 57,621 deaths in the US of Pneumonia AND Influenza  #8203; And then repeating the number associated it with the chart in the title: February 1st to June 27th of 2020: 123,177 deaths in the US of ONLY Pneumonia  #8203; While the rate of pneumonia deaths increases every year, it is only by a few thousand (I can go back a few years more if requested, but for now, meh, it #8217;s all much less than 10,000 deaths difference per year). Then you get to a couple months this year, and the number more than doubles. From the original graph, this group is entirely different than the 112,700 deaths where COVID was listed as the primary cause. Following this pattern, let #8217;s guess/assume that somewhere between 60-65k died of pneumonia in 2019, making it we #8217;ll say 70-75k pneumonia deaths total this year to play it safe, but that is being extremely generous based on the trend. That still leaves roughly 48-53k worth of pneumonia deaths that seemed to have popped up out of nowhere. Remember that these numbers are in the span of a couple months.  #8203; As is well known, a common cause of death from COVID is pneumonia which are the numbers I am trying to show here. While there are other known/suspected causes of COVID deaths, such as cytokine storms, blood clots, organ failure (caused by cytokine storms sometimes), etc, I am only showing pneumonia cases to keep it a simple and linear discussion.  #8203; So to repeat what I was saying at the beginning, for those of you who do not believe this virus is  #8220;that bad #8221;, or not worth stressing over/protecting yourself against, why do you believe this? I do not want hyperbolic answers as those don #8217;t help here (I #8217;m an RN so I see a lot of sick COVID patients, but I #8217;m not saying that makes me have more or less  #8220;qualified #8221; hyperbolic instances than you, I am simply stating that just because something doesn #8217;t apply to you doesn #8217;t mean the world around you isn #8217;t on fire).  #8203; Thanks! I hope I #8217;m not downvoted a ton as I just want discussion. I can also provide more sources if you #8217;d like, but these were the best I could find at the moment.  #8203; TL;DR  #8203; People who don #8217;t believe the virus is that bad, as a well-known cause of COVID related deaths, pneumonia deaths in 2 months are more than double that of previous years, and that #8217;s not including other known COVID-related causes of death. That is also completely disregarding the official reported number of COVID deaths since we know those numbers are unreliable. And please no finger-pointing.  #8203; Thanks!</TEXT>

    <TEXT>My question to you, Did you read the post? I know it's long, but this has nothing to do with actual COVID numbers or antibodies, or even politics for that matter. I agree what Cuomo did was absolute garbage and he must be one of the dumbest people alive to allow such a thing (I am more left-leaning but like to think I am open-minded and maybe even more centrist than left). This has nothing to do with that, so please actually read the post. Or even the TL;DR for that matter. I only have that link for the graph, but completely ignored the actual covid portion.

I understand that part of the argument which is why I didn't put it up for debate.  #8203; And as I stated to the other person, on the chart, COVID related deaths are in a completely separate bar than pneumonia deaths. I understand people screwed up, numbers are inflated/deflated to make orange man look good/bad, so I am completely disregarding deaths related to COVID, and instead, focusing on pneumonia, which has a much more clear-cut diagnosing process and is much harder to "fake".</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Obviously I think it's bad, otherwise this post would not have been made. But because of this, I focused on the pneumonia aspect instead of the COVID because I know the "official" COVID numbers are bs, so I wanted to discuss the issue while using a different point than the obviously screwed up numbers. And these numbers do not include COVID numbers. I am literally asking for differing opinions. Shitting on my data because "WuFlu" numbers are wrong when I'm trying to argue that the increase in pneumonia cases over the past few months are troublesome isn't debating or giving me a differing opinion, it's just being a dick. Are you sure I'm the one who's trying to denigrate/cancel those who do not agree with my assumption? Is there any data that I could possibly bring up that would make you discuss anything in a non-dicky manner?</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Now I think I finally understand what you mean, even if you are still ignoring the point of the post. I'll address this, but I'm honestly over anything you say other than directly addressing the post, you've added nothing but discourse to someone who is trying to educate themselves on the other side of the spectrum. Just because I don't believe the numbers doesn't mean I don't think its "that bad". Maybe I'm biased because I'm a nurse and have seen the severity of cases here, maybe I'm biased by the numbers that the world is reporting outside of the US, maybe I'm biased because I am a liberal who lives in a blue state. The possibilities of my bias are endless. Just because I don't believe the numbers reported here doesn't mean I don't believe this is a huge issue. If I think someone going out shooting 50 people is bad, but I'm skeptical because it was at a house party of only 40 people, and then the official number comes out to be 39 after everything blows over, doesn't mean that I don't think the situation was terrible. Sure 39 is better than 50, but that is still a terrible situation.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I can't believe I'm saying this on a post with 29 (now 30) responses, but thank you for actually reading what I posted (I am assuming that you are going off of my text post instead of the graph on its own). I posted here because I thought this sub was the most open-minded over the other political subs. I've been proven terribly wrong so far (sorry, I'm very frustrated).  #8203; But to get to the point, speaking of PNEUMONIA only, not even covid, I had made the assumption that there are 48-53k more deaths at this point compared to previous years. I want to emphasize that this number is also assuming that we have 70-75k total pneumonia deaths total for the whole year of 2020. This additional 48-53k deaths are in excess of that 70-75k deaths, and this is only spanning in the time of a little under 5 months. So based on PNEUMONIA ALONE, at this current trend (and remember that diagnoses and cases were a bit slower in February through the beginning of April), we will have roughly 120k deaths due to pneumonia in excess of the 70-75k. Meaning that of "pneumonia deaths" in 2020, we will be at 190-195k deaths by the end of the year prior to previous years. And that's just focusing on the pneumonia diagnosis (I know the post isn't about covid specifically, but it's not like there are 0 covid deaths either, so the number is probably higher).  #8203; This is all assuming that the current overall trend of the past 5 months continues. It may exponentially increase or decrease, only time will tell.  #8203; Sorry if the post doesnt make sense. Let me know and I'll try to find a different way to explain it.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>You're right, simplifying the numbers does make it seem much less scary. And as you said, even if we were to double it (well say for actual covid cases vs the reported just for arguments sake), no, I would not have the same reaction that is happening all over the us. Even if we were to triple to an additional 21.5 deaths in a population of 50k, well say for the blood clots, cytokine storms, etc, I still would not, I 100% see where you're coming from. I hope that the lockdowns arent keeping our numbers artificially low, and these numbers dont grow exponentially over the next few weeks/months since were just making assumptions on current trends. Hyperbolic testaments seem like were headed in that direction, so well see. Do you mind if I ask, are you okay with wearing masks? Or are you against them? Sorry about wordiness btw, I used to instruct high schoolers so I feel that whenever I explain something, I need to OVERexplain everything:)</TEXT>

    <TITLE>Weird "pulling" sensation in knee when getting out of car.</TITLE>
    <DATE>2020-10-08 18:17:22</DATE>
    <TEXT>Hi! So for the past few months, whenever i get out of my car (and this only happens specifically when getting out of my car), i get a 1-2 second pulling sensation on my patellar tendon in my right knee. It goes away instantly afterwards as if it never happened. It has been getting slightly more intense lately with a little bit of pain associated with it, and im worried that itll blow or something which would put me out of work for a while and seriously dampen my plans on getting engaged and moving this upcoming year. So some background info: 26 y/o male, 6'2" 245 lbs. RN so im on my feet a lot, but pretty inactive outside of work My car is a honda accord, so pretty low to the ground. When getting out, think tall person trying to stand up from a low toilet with the left leg first. I park on the street on a pretty steep incline facing up. So when i am standing up completely and the pulling sensation hits, my right leg is going up the slope and left leg is going downwards. This sensation does not happen when walking, running, getting up from any other position, or even while doing squats. Medications: Atorvastatin, Intuniv, Lamictal, rare Adderall on nights im assigned to give chemo (probs once or twice a month tops) Any advice or help would be greatly appreciated.</TEXT>
