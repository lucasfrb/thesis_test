    <TITLE>I loved Tetris Attack. You?</TITLE>
    <DATE>2014-12-03 07:51:18</DATE>
    <TEXT>As title. I haven't found another game that was better than Tetris Attack in the genre, nor has there ever been a decent port (Puzzle League on DS was atrocious as far as the controls were concerned, touch just doesn't do precision well) Anyone else here who loved Tetris Attack and have found solace in other titles that are similar? On any platform? Heck, even touch, though I don't see how touch can get the level of precision a game like that requires. **Stuff I've tried:** * Lumines (sucks) * Super Puzzle Fighter PS3 (pretty good) * Puyo Puyo (it was ok) * Idol Money Exchanger (also ancient on mame) * Tetris (the classic... Not as good, no cool combos)</TEXT>

    <TITLE>Preferred web player 4P controls setup?</TITLE>
    <DATE>2015-03-27 19:07:54</DATE>
    <TEXT>Hey there guys :) Huge fan of multiplayer games, I'm busy making a 4 player physics crate-em-up, and I was wondering, what's the most common, preferred and usable setup for 4P games on Unity Web Players? (Unity web build doesn't allow control configuration easily) My game is currently setup with two on keyboard (WASD + F, and arrow keys + enter) and two xbox360 controllers. Is that the usual/preferred? Would really appreciate all inputs to see what everyone prefers :) Thanks all! :D</TEXT>

    <TITLE>Fantastic Theme/mechanic fit</TITLE>
    <DATE>2015-03-31 11:45:39</DATE>
    <TEXT>A fantastic theme/mechanic fit is what excites me most about boardgames - when bits of paper and wood abstracts something so well you feel like you're actually doing it (minus the work) it's a great feeling, it's always been my holy grail of game design (both making and playing). **Some of my "past favourites"** in terms of the mechanic/theme fit: * Netrunner * Mystery Rummy: Jack the Ripper * Dead of Winter I can't think of many more right now, because it's actually quite rare when it does happen. This weekend I got to play a few games that fit so incredibly well that I just had to share: **Tokaido** - I must admit, I've seen it everywhere, and it totally didn't appeal to me. Eventually gave it a try, and the theme/mechanic fit is so elegant it's mindblowing. I *feel* like a tourist travelling somewhere, I *feel* like I must do everything there is to do within the tiny bits of time I have on holiday. I *feel* like I'm perpetually broke, spending all my money on all these mysterious things that's supposed to make my holiday "more fun" but instead ending up with a huge headache :P **Sushi Go** - it's so simple! It's conveyor belt sushi! Passing your hand along like every other drafting game in this case made it feel utterly like I'm sitting at the counter of a conveyor belt fast sushi joint. It's uncanny and fun to boot :) ------------- If you care for theme/mechanic fit, what're some of your favourites that fit this bill? :D</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I always thought the game was really interesting. I looked at the boardgame and the rules made no sense to me. I didn't know what to do. I downloaded the iOS game and gave it a shot. It still confused the crap out of me. Normally I would just blame it on my own lack of compatibility with games that present too many choices (I like streamlined choices, Chess for example is something I REALLY CAN'T STAND), but Yggdrasil just... tickles me.

    <TEXT>There's 19 of us so far, and we'll take turns draftin an ID each (runner OR corp). Then we'll reverse the order and draft again. The initial order was determined by our last tournament - the last tourney's winner goes last in the first round of drafting and first in the second round of drafting. **Edit:** we are building our own decks - not playing draft. So we draft IDs ahead of the tournament and then go build decks. Effectively EVERYONE WILL BE PLAYING DIFFERENT IDS :D These are our identities we're using, are we missing anything?

    <TITLE>Factory Funner - The [boardgame] sequel to the puuzzly classic Factory Fun</TITLE>
    <DATE>2015-09-05 08:47:39</DATE>
    <TEXT>Hi all, I'm the artist on Factory Funner (game designed by Corn #233; van Moorsel), and I'm super excited to share the kickstarter with you guys :D The KS is live here: [Factory Funner Kickstarter!](https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/cwali/factory-funner-crowdfund-edition) Factory Funner - the name is weird right? It's a combination of Dutch being the designer's first language, and the fact that this is a sequel to Factory Fun. Factory Fun had two editions - first published by Corn #233; himself under his own company Cwali, then picked up for another print by the boardgame publisher Z-Man. From my own perspective, it was super fun to work on Factory Funner, because Corn #233; gave me a ton of leeway to go crazy making really crazy machines for the game, as such I'm super proud of the game. I can't embed images, sigh. Anyway, about the game - it's a 1 to 4 player (5 players at the first stretch goal) puzzly game where you put machines into your factory, and connect them up to supplies and reservoirs with pipes and more machines, all the while doing your best to be as efficient (cheap) as possible. It's a spacial challenge, and plays really quickly. Simultaneous turntaking means very little downtime, and if someone takes too long you can all nag him with a timer :) It's a big and family friendly game (I had to cut a piece of art I really liked and a tribute to Star Wars because it wasn't family friendly enough, sigh) and plays quickly. If you have any questions, feel free to shout here :) Again, the KS link: [Factory Funner Kickstarter!](https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/cwali/factory-funner-crowdfund-edition) Thank you for your time! :)</TEXT>

    <TITLE>My NY Resolution: Logging plays</TITLE>
    <DATE>2015-12-31 20:26:00</DATE>
    <TEXT>I used to think it's a ton of effort so didn't think twice about not doing it, but I've come across a cool app "Board Game Stats", and it makes logging plays relatively painless. It even tracks scores across plays and comes up with a record of how you and people you bother logging for are doing in various games. It'll also help me develop my own games by tracking scores easier so I can see when it's getting more stable or has become crazy due to some dumb changes, well not that I wasn't doing that, but now I can do it easier. Anyone else here logging plays of your games? How do you do it?</TEXT>

    <TITLE>Priest player never ending turn</TITLE>
    <DATE>2016-01-07 12:26:27</DATE>
    <TEXT>Don't wanna name and shame, but I can, and I don't see how it would make a difference. There's a guy who delays the game, heals, entombs, etc, and never ends turn. Never. Ever. Clearly just to drag the game out to irritate the opponent, presumably that nets him easy concedes. WHAT THE HELL CAN BE DONE ABOUT THIS?!? Edit: No, it's not a disconnect issue. Read my post properly, the game carries on as normal, the only difference is that the opponent doesn't hit "end turn" after they're done. They just wait for the fuse to come on and finishes their turn by force.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Just had my first game of Arkham Horror. I'm going to get crucified for this but so what. The game takes SO long, there's SO little impact in what your choices have on outcomes, bad rolls are bad rolls and great rolls are great rolls... It's just not very interesting from an agency point of view, it feels like a glorified Choose Your Own Adventure book. Why does it have 6 expansions and so much love??? Why?????</TEXT>

    <TITLE>How for is too far for miniaturisation? (or, are you backing Ultra Tiny Epic Kingdoms because you think it's actually better than TEK?)</TITLE>
    <DATE>2016-03-27 16:44:40</DATE>
    <TEXT>As the subject. I feel like there is a point where making things smaller and smaller has diminishing returns. With the growth of microgames I feel like there's should be a bit of sanity that prevails when it comes down to it (kinda pun kinda intended). I really do prefer the unique meeples in TEK to the nondescript cubes in UTEK. TEK is already small enough to fit just about anywhere, and the tablespace that UTEK needs isn't really all that much less than its larger (not by that much) brother. There's of course an economic motive in that it's cheaper to produce smaller games, but again, there's diminishing returns when consumers (especially kickstarters) gotta pay for shipping anyway. What do you think?</TEXT>

    <TITLE>SteamVR + Unity - displaying different content between HMD and Monitor</TITLE>

    <TEXT>Hi guys I've googled far and wide for this issue and had no luck. What I want is basically to output different stuff to the monitor as from the HMD. I found a method that claims to work for Oculus but it doesn't work for the Vive, throwing a "Oculus not initialised" error. But of course, because I'm using a Vive. I see no way to change the device settings though. The method:  gt; Player Settings  gt; Virtual Reality Supported  gt; Go to a camera  gt; Target Eye  gt; None (Main Display) Then when I run it, it gives me an error, something about "Oculus not initialised". Any ideas?</TEXT>

I'm level 24, I don't want to spend more than one ball catching pidgeys, haven't been able to keep a lot of balls lately due to potion update (which I ain't complaining about since I'd been really hurting for pots), and I land great! first shot most of the time)</TEXT>

    <TITLE>Things to look for in your lineup?</TITLE>
    <DATE>2016-08-29 18:13:51</DATE>
    <TEXT>I've been wondering if people actually build "a team" to fight with - I usually go one of two routes: 1) Situationally judge what the first few pokes are in the gym lineup, and pull my best ones to fight the first few, usually jacking out after beating the first few, or 2) Bring out my biggest guns and ignore type matchups mostly when I get lazy, and just go for a roflstomp I know 1 is more efficient, and 2 is lazy but often reliable. Is there actually a method 3) where you build a team of "best attackers" which work for most matchup combinations, and take them into battle (ordered with the first one to take advantage of type matchups) all the time? Is there a set combination that people usually make a team of? Like "must have a water type with water attacks, an electric type with fire attacks" etc etc something like that? Or do you just pile your highest CP in and go from there? Thanks senseis :)</TEXT>

    <TITLE>How to determine "stronger among equal CP"?</TITLE>
    <DATE>2016-08-30 19:57:24</DATE>
    <TEXT>Especially for training gyms, the CP of the poke you take into battle matters a lot. But some of them could take down big boys, some can't. How do you actually tell? Is it a matter of looking for better movesets, for STAB, etc? Or is there more to it? For example I have a Slowpoke with Water Gun/Water Pulse and a Krabby with Bubble/Bubble Beam, both about the same CP, and the Krabby always performs worse. Does it just come down to movesets, or do species have largely different stats even among similar CP?</TEXT>

    <TITLE>Appraisal shorthand for quickly checking pokes out</TITLE>
    <DATE>2016-09-11 19:56:50</DATE>
    <TEXT>When I get new pokes of decent CP or CP that I'm looking for (for trainers usually), I quickly appraise and note the appraisal results on the name so I don't have to do the appraisal again, and to make use of later in the cool IV calculator that takes all the appraisal into account: https://pokemon.gameinfo.io/tools/iv-calculator For example: **Cubone bade** * first letter: a,b,c or d depending on the first part of the appraisal. I'm Valor so b = "a strong pokemon! should be proud!" one. * next 1 - 3 letters: depends on its strongest feature. It could be one or all three. * last letter: for me Valor is "e" excellent, "b" for blown away, "g" for gets the job done, "d" for does not inspire greatness. Then after shooting these into the IV calculator later I just replace it with the IV% :) Saves me some time re-doing appraisals when I run IVs later on those who're worthy :) Each Team will probably have shorthands that make the most sense their appraisals. If the poke's name doesn't allow for the shorthand, just shorten it. Charmeleon = Charme ahae. After I decided to keep a mon, I switch to the "A1B2FrFg 96" naming convention :)</TEXT>
