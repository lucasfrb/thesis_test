    <TEXT>You can tell a lot about a person by their favorite songs; people rarely listen to songs over and over again that they don't relate to. The big issue is fingerprinting; with 3,749 people you are one in a crowd, but every time a new piece of data can be reliably connected to the old one that number shrinks and shrinks, until even if the data is anonymous the person no longer is. Individually these factoids are harmless, it is collectively that they start to cause problems.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>By the late 60s/early 70s, the gold standard of science fiction was "hard sci-fi" compared to the Flash Gordon science fantasy of the early years. This meant that a lot of effort went into ensuring that any science imagination was limited to the core parts of the plot; on the mild side you had "no audible explosions in space" while some authors would brag about spending weeks calculating the physics of some minor background part of the story to make sure that when the vintage version of Comic Book Guy started poking at it he would find nothing to criticize science-wise. As the 70s progressed there was a schism as people from the "soft sciences" started writing stories that mainly focused on the anthropological side of future societies rather than on the technology itself. While good sci-fi always used the technology to extrapolate its impact on societies, these older hard sci-fi writers didn't have any formal training in anthropology, sociology, psychology, etc., while these new writers had the reverse issue, where they understood those but had no formal training in physics, astronomy, chemistry, etc. While these genres eventually split, for a while they had a lot of influence on one another; one trend that was especially popular in the 1970s was the idea of ["future shock"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Future_Shock); the idea that technological innovations tended to work on themselves, making it harder and harder to properly predict the scope the longer you tried to look into the future, to the point that people can becomes strangers to their own world during their own lifetimes. If this idea is accepted, making hard sci-fi for the far-future becomes impossible. The optimists started promoting the idea of the "technological singularity", caused when the rate of technological change became so fast that it was basically vertical, a sort of happy utopian afterlife brought on by science and too wonderful to imagine; this created a backlash -- that backlash was cyberpunk, a world where mankind invents pocket supercomputers and they are used for the most pointless things, invents cures for cancer that are squandered, and these things snowball towards what William Gibson called the "Tommy Hilfiger event horizon", an anti-singularity.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I imagine it will be about obfuscation; hiding from machines and systems often involves doing things that are very conspicuous to people. Someone might go to a pizza place, order a pizza to be delivered to the address they want to go to, and then bribe the delivery driver to let them ride along. So of course they are tracked moving from point A to point B, but as DominoHoldingCorp-Fleetunit8856 (scheduled delivery) rather than the weird pizzacart with two people crammed inside.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>A few ways to think it through: * People are petty. Let's say you get into a pissing match with someone on Reddit over some pop culture thing and it gets to the point where they aren't satisfied with downvoting or even with a report; it's not important at all, realistically, although you didn't feel that way at the time when you got into it. In the heat of the moment some people may have the temptation to try to mess with you out of spite. If you protect your privacy out of habit, it will be there when you need it unexpectedly over something dumb. This is really the best for privacy protection because any protection of privacy can only last so long -- if someone calms down before they have caused any harm, then your habits have worked. * Cultural tastes change. The things you take for granted as being boring and normal today might not be in the future; while protecting your privacy habitually can't protect you from a long-term change, it can give you enough time to realize what is happening and make informed choices over what to do next, rather than waking up one day and being shocked to find you are the bad guy now. * If not for you, think about your friends and family. When people can't dig up any dirt on a person directly, the next step is to proxy it through their friends and family. If you guard your privacy out of habit you also indirectly guard their privacy.</TEXT>

    <TEXT> gt;Can you really imagine companies like Amazon changing the name and completely wrecking their brand recognition in the next hundred years? Companies frequently do this to get a reset when there is negative public image, such as when Phillip-Morris tobacco became Altria. Alternately, if a particular company brand becomes viewed in an overwhelmingly positive way, sometimes the company will change its name to be the same as that brand. An 80s example would be how Consolidated Foods became Sara Lee. If we are talking Amazon, perhaps it would become AWS. If a company takes over another one, sometimes they will see the other company's name as a prize and will take it as its own, so the leadership will be of the one company while the name is of the other.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Unless you rely heavily on location-based apps that can only work through having a smartphone, a good step for privacy is to consider whether you really need an all-in-one device, or if you would be happy with two or three separate devices. Often getting each individually ends up being cheaper than one device that can do everything; dumbphones are very affordable now. For a lot of people, there would be no drop in their enjoyment from having to reach into their pocket twice to pause their music and answer their phone rather than once, or to reach into their bag to browse Reddit from a tablet or laptop rather than reaching into their pocket for their phone. By not turning it into an all-or-nothing choice, take this smartphone full of spyware or lose the ability to play music and movies and talk on the phone and browse the web and figure out how much you walked today, it becomes easier to refuse bundled in "features" that are not for your benefit.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Ask if they need your address if you pre-pay your membership; often the official reason for collecting this info is for billing purposes in a month-to-month contract. Ask if the birthdate is for record-keeping, or if you are expected to show something with your birthdate on it to enter the gym. If it is for record-keeping, there is no real reason they need your birthdate, they just want to make sure they don't confuse you with any other Joe Smiths at the gym, so you could easily be the Joe Smith born on the 1st of January, 1900. :) If it is for ID, it may be a bit trickier to work around other than using a gym that does not use birthdate for identification. If you are in an area where there are no smaller gyms, only large data-hungry ones, ask about if they have any reciprocal memberships with other gyms elsewhere. Some of those gyms might have less invasive applications; you could get a membership there and then use it at your local gym.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>If you film someone and combine that with personal data you have collected about them to create a dossier, and then use or can be expected to use that dossier maliciously, you can probably be charged with stalking. It may require a lawyer, but the groundwork is already there. Now imagine that a dossier is created that can be expected to be used maliciously, but that dossier was created automatically by a mixture of software and third-party contractors; who is the responsible party? Imagine a surveillance-sharing pool like Amazon Ring is promoting, where each individual camera is owned by a separate person, and then that data is hosted on a third-party cloud site. The host can say that they are just a host like a web server. The camera manufactures can say that they are not responsible for the uses of the individuals who purchase them. The individuals can point out that they don't even know the person, and the pool service can point out that it was collected automatically through software. Perhaps a market research aggregator has tacked this location data and footage onto other public data that it did not collect itself; are they now the responsible party? Once the information is digitized, it becomes easy to cross national borders; perhaps it is cheaper to host in an overseas cloud, now there is a jurisdictional issue. Now imagine that instead of the data being sold to the final user, it is stolen and re-sold; now who is responsible? The legal system has not caught up to this way of doing things, which makes it worse for the average person.</TEXT>

People try to blend in as much as possible to avoid conflict, or they stand out to warn others that they are dangerous.

    <TEXT>I don't think there's such a thing as lovable cyberpunk jobs. Even if it's a well-paid job working for a megacorp, being cyber-Dilbert or cyber-Wally isn't likely to be satisfying. Doing satisfying work to build a better world is kind of opposite of the cyberpunk method of technology production. There are cyberpunk jobs I'd like to read about, though. Like the guy who has to clean up after cyberjunkies die or are evicted from their /r/neckbeardnests or the buyer for a grocery store in a world where there are no good counterfeiting controls, and someone has to assess whether it's genuine rat or doctored-up vat-grown isolate.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Cyberpunk film was heavily influenced by film noir, which loves to play with shadows. The cyberpunk twist was that the light source was often neon signage, so the classic neon colors became associated. On the other hand, I've never gone back through old movies to see if there is one that is the leader. Also, I don't know about why pink and blue have out-competed neon yellow, green, red, and purple. Like in Blade Runner, they used the full neon spectrum for lighting: https://2.bp.blogspot.com/-JlqxVbl9iOc/VGPQpPY5AwI/AAAAAAAAUfs/btuT_NOwL1U/s1600/Newspaper.jpg</TEXT>
