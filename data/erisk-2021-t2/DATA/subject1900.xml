    <TEXT>Howdy! I noticed that my Spring schedule allowed for some actual free time, and wanted to get together with some people to play. The target day is looking like Saturday. The setting is probably going to be either homebrewed dungeonpunk or Eberron. I'm very happy to play with people of all skill levels, as my games tend to be very flexible with the official rules.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>For all my fellow collegues in the GG community who lean to the left, the past several days/weeks/months may have been a bit eye-opening. As we start cracking open the ossified gaming journalism community, many of you have had the terrible experience of seeing people whom you like/respected go out of their way to tar you as a violent misogynist, a backwards troll unfit for civilized society. I feel for you, I truly do. Why? Because that's been the experience of conservatives whenever we try to engage in academia or popular culture. Over the past several decades, "conservative" has come to equal "evil" in the minds of the people who shape popular thought. That's why they're calling all of us "right-wingers," when our own polling shows that conservative libertarians are a minority on the active GG posts. You saw the Law  amp; Order episode making all of us out to be ISIS- now think about how many times the villain of a show or movie turns out to be religiously or socially conservative. Do you think that those portrayals were any more accurate? I'm very much not advocating for people to turn to actual conservative values because of this; GG is great because it's bringing together people from all sorts of backgrounds with a multitude of ideas and approaches that makes us stronger than our detractors' hugboxes. What I'm asking is that you start thinking about how you view the right wingers in the light of what's happening to us all right now. We've already seen that the media loves the victimhood narratives of Sark  amp; co., so just ask yourself what other victim narratives you may have seen and simply agreed with because the villains were conservative white men?</TEXT>

    <DATE>2015-03-15 18:03:19</DATE>
    <TEXT>I was reading the latest self-important bluster coming out of Moviebob's Twitter, and finally remembered something he made some years ago that should have warned us that he was going to be like this. [Magneto was Right](http://www.escapistmagazine.com/videos/view/the-big-picture/2709-Magneto-Was-Right) This video (from 2011) shows how he views power and its uses. Specifically, he argues that most nerds would, if given super powers, be far more like Magneto than the X Men. He feels that, as a group, we've been marginalized and insulted so much that most of us would turn into genocidal dictators if given the power to do so. Now, he doesn't have the power to control magnetism, but MB seems all to happy to try and use what tiny little power he has to make the lives of people he disagrees with miserable.</TEXT>

    <TITLE>SeaNanners- Possible Undisclosed Sponsorship(s)</TITLE>
    <DATE>2015-04-10 14:42:13</DATE>
    <TEXT>Howdy, I've been a big fan of LP'er [SeaNanners](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCq54nlcoX-0pLcN5RhxHyug), but two of his recent videos have had me somewhat concerned that he may be violating ethical policy. I don't have anything concrete, however, so please save the mob accusations for if/when something solid comes up. Two of his recent videos, Old School and Great Success? seemed to depart greatly from his previous videos (mostly GMod or other Steam games played live with friends). The content matches some of his earlier, more serious, stuff, but the thing that had me concerned were the games he recommends at the start of each video and plays in the background while he speaks. Both games are F2P mobile games made by the same publisher- Gameloft, and feature title screens nearly identical to each other (with the app-store icon featuring the publisher's logo clearly displayed, unlike other games that he plays). I checked, but couldn't find any mention on his Facebook or Twitter feed that said they were paid promotions, but they seem to have that feel to them. During a recent NerdCubed AMA here, somebody asked him if he was being offered sponsorship deals, and he acknowledged that he, along with several other popular YouTubers, was. He went on to say that people should look out for YouTubers who "suddenly cover mobile and F2P games." I know that Nanners isn't part of the games press- he's most famous for trolling his friends on GMod games, but he does co-run his own multi-channel network, Jetpak. I haven't seen anything similar from [Syndicate](https://www.youtube.com/user/TheSyndicateProject/videos), the channel run by Jetpak's other owner, which would suggest that this is Nanners acting as an individual, not a MCN manager. Again, please note that this is pretty much speculation. I'm unfortunately pressed for digging time and, to be frank, don't think that I'd be great at it anyway. If people could help find out more, I'd be very happy to work with them. Ultimately, I really hope that Nanners is just screwing around. However, if he is taking money under the table, I'd like that called out. We have to hold the people we love to the same standards we hold our opponents to. *EDIT: 3:12 PM MST 4/10/15* Here is the email that I sent to Nanner's account: Dear Mr. Montoya, I am currently trying to get information on two of your recent videos- Old School (VIDEO LINK) and Great Success? (OTHER VIDEO LINK). They both seem kinda out of place with your normal slate of videos. I am aware that you are a mobile developer, and would love to see this variety of games featured on your channel, but the similarities to each other and their short release span has raised some possible flags. For example: both game introduction screens are unique to these games (with other videos lacking a prominent intro screen to the game with the exception of in-game menus), with the app-store logo featured prominently in the upper right corner of each. Both games are recent releases from the same publisher, Gameloft, who, while a very prolific publisher, is also known for pushing out somewhat less-than-quality product in the desire to make money fast in the mobile arena. As a professional channel owner, you must understand how much the gaming community has been focused on enforcing ethical standards of disclosure across multiple avenues of the games press. I understand that you are not a member of the games press, but you are a well-loved and highly popular figure in our community, and your recommendations on both games carry a great weight among potential customers. If these videos are your personal opinion of both games without any involvement of Gameloft or their related companies, then please just let us know that they aren't paid promotions. If they are, please just put some kind of prominent label as to that fact. Either way, it is your channel and I'll continue watching and enjoying your and your friends' videos. If you would like to make any sort of statement, please feel free to reply to myself at this address or the Reddit thread here (LINK TO THIS THREAD). Thank you, *MY NAME*</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I've been tasked with finding all parcels that lie within 250 feet of a specified parcel with an odd exception- if the buffer would run into a road or water feature, then it must keep going past the normal 250' for the same distance (if it ran into a 20' road, for example, then it must extend 270' from the parcel in that direction). I'm currently creating several buffers- one for the 250' and another for the various distances, and editing the 250' manually to snap to the verteces of the corrected distance buffer. Is there a better way to automate this process?</TEXT>

    <TEXT>In Gravity Falls' sister series, Rick and Morty, there's a race of alien parasites that sneak into people's lives disguised as wacky sitcom characters. The parasites can then rewrite the memories of those around them, making it seem as if they've known the parasite's character for years. What does this have to do with Gravity Falls? Tad Strange. Why is it that there's literally one normal person left in town? Because he's the wacky sitcom character compared to the rest of the citizens. He only showed up after Ford got back (allowing a parasite to jump to this dimension from one which he visited in exile), but everyone acts as if they've known him for years.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I was talking to one of my coworkers the other day, and he told me about a dream project of his that he wanted to work on. He's got a nice collection of New York memorabilia, and set them up in a display case. What he wants is a button to go alongside it that, when pressed, would play Sinatra's "New York, New York" on speakers around the room. The biggest issue that he has is that he's trying to get it done relatively cheaply. I told him that I would check to see if somebody online knew what he should do. Any help or suggestions would be very much appreciated. *EDIT* Thank you all for the advice! I'm taking these ideas to him to see what he'd like to do.</TEXT>

    <DATE>2017-03-14 17:15:04</DATE>
    <TEXT>My group just finished The Curse of Strahd after six fun months of gaming. My biggest dissapointment was Strahd, himself. The three PCs (level 9) hit him for just about 110 damage before he got a turn, and the sunlight from the sun blade nearly killed him outright. They fought him in his crypt, so there was nowhere for him to run, either. The big bad that I had been hyping them to face in an epic showdown proved to be easier to kill than the first vampire spawn they challenged. Is this luck? Did I run the fight poorly? Is he just designed to fall? I'm happy to run this campaign in the future, but would like help to make the final fight an epic one.</TEXT>

I have 6 Oblits and 151 Blood in my bag. I used the first, and got a ping noise that sounded like it had worked. One Oblit and two Blood were used, but the goggles were still 880. I tried again with the same results. Then I closed out and waited for a few moments and tried again, with the same results. Are goggles unable to go to 900? If so, why can I use the oblits on them? **EDIT: Looks like it was a temporary bug that let you use Oblit and Bloods on the goggles, and this was patched out. Blizz doesn't want Engineers accidentally making something useful outside Blingtron.**</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Few adventures can claim to be as iconic as Gary Gygax's Keep on the Borderlands. Now you, too, can join the thousands of adventurers who made their way into the wilderness and discovered the action, intrigue, and dangers of the Caves of Chaos. I'm looking to set up a Saturday gaming session, either in the afternoon or evenings (EST). **Dragonfire Keep was once the watch placed on the domain of a defeated Red Wyrm. But a century of peace has lulled the keep's defenders into a false sense of security. Evil creatures have started returning to their old haunts, preying on the innocent. Desperate for aid, Duke Galren V, descendent of the mighty paladin who slew the Wyrm and built the keep, has sent for adventurers to clear the lands and bring peace once more. Yet little does he know that a dark fate hangs over his head. Will the adventurers manage to discover the location of the dreaded Caves of Chaos? Can they save the Duke from a nightmarish destiny?** My games tend to run as action-adventure stories. I play fast-and-loose with the rules when they conflict with the Rule of Cool. If that sounds like the kind of game you might be interested in, let me know!</TEXT>

    <TITLE>SPOILER - Rules question about a Jabba's Realm boss</TITLE>
    <DATE>2018-02-08 21:48:13</DATE>
    <TEXT>I had a question about one of the bosses in a Jabba's Realm mission. I'm the Imperial, and my players just ran through the story mission where Boba Fett helped them go after an Imperial officer who's holding a rancor from Jabba. As part of that mission, the officer gets to use three actions per turn, and any number of those could be attacks. Now, I spawned in an AT-ST for him to hide behind, and used all his three command actions to attack with the walker (plus the walker's own attack on its turn). I ended up winning the match by having him survive (with 1 hp). However, I was only able to do so because my AT-ST killed Boba Fett in one turn. Was this a legal use of the elite officer's Command ability? Could I use it three times per turn to activate the same model, or are there limits to how often I can interrupt with the same figure? I would hate to think I won through misreading the rules, but I can't find a limit to individual figure activations for this specific case. Thank you. (Edit: Thank you very much for the responses. As a follow-up, does that mean the Rebels can only use their special attacks once per round? ex: Biv's combo attack)</TEXT>

    <TITLE>Idea: Majority Vote Cinematic Skips</TITLE>
    <DATE>2018-04-17 18:02:48</DATE>
    <TEXT>I love the PvE events this year. They're a fun chance to work together with far less salt or bm than a normal QM or Comp game. The game's story really benefits from the added lore. However, watching the intro/outro every match gets old fast. While the option to skip exists, I have only seen it used maybe 1 in 4 or 5 matches. The problem is three players vote to skip, while one player abstains. My solution? Majority (3/4 votes) cinematic skip, on the condition that all players have played at least one event match prior (so first timers can still watch them in game if they want).</TEXT>

    <TITLE>Either Poe was wrong or Rose was wrong</TITLE>
    <DATE>2018-07-16 17:19:29</DATE>
    <TEXT>In the beginning of TLJ, Poe is demoted for not following Leia's retreat order and leading all of the Resistance's bombers on a suicide run (also taking out several of their fighters). Later, Rose is given a heroic moment when she stops Finn from making a suicide run into the Death Ram. The problem is that both characters' actions are later shown to have saved lives, but only one of them is told to be in the wrong. Let's do a thought experiment with the first scenario. What would have happened if Poe calls off the bombing run and they all run away? Well, this part is a little more speculative, but we see that the FO has trouble hitting the Resistance ships with any kind of power at range. Know what has enough oomph to obliterate an underground bunker complex from orbit? The dreadnaught. If it survives Poe's attack, the FO will have its big guns obliterate the helpless convoy at range. The Resistance crew? Dead. The bombers? Still dead (blown up in a hangar when the TIEs attack, I'd bet). But Poe is called out for his reckless behavior by Leia, supposedly wasting lives when they could have run. I will grant the movie this makes sense, as the Rebels of her time often survived by hit-and-run tactics relying on being able to jump away when the big guns came out. From the information *that the characters have*, Leia is acting reasonably towards Poe because she couldn't know the FO was tracking the ships and would meet them on the other side of the jump. Everyone good? Because Rose is about to break this logic. The Resistance is now holed up in an old Rebel base. The only thing standing between them and the overwhelming might of the FO is a giant door. Finn, Poe, Rose, and a few other pilots take the only vehicles that can run to make a last-ditch suicide run at the Death Ram to buy the Resistance time for their allies to gather together and come to their rescue. This plan hinges entirely on the door- if it falls, the Resistance is going to be wiped out by the army outside. Finn makes the decision to run right inside the Death Ram. Up until that point, nobody had any actual suggestions on how to take down the Ram, except that Finn says that it's vulnerable while charging. This gives them a limited time in which to act. Despite this, Poe (after learning his lesson earlier) decides to pull back after they take a few casualties (even after Rey draws off the fighter cover and none of the walkers decide to fire at the heroes). Finn, however, volunteers to sacrifice himself to take one final shot at the Death Ram. I will ignore the issue as to whether or not he would have succeeded, except to point out that Finn's plan seems to have a much greater chance of working compared to Poe's do-nothing idea. Finally, as Finn approaches the Ram, Rose comes in from his 3 o clock and smashes his speeder out of the way. She saves him from sacrificing himself by dooming both them and the Resistance to capture/death. Again, I will use the *character's* knowledge as opposed to our own. Rose can't know about Luke coming in to distract the FO. Rose can't know about the hidden exit (having been told very specifically that there were no other exits to the base outside the door). Rose does know that the Ram can open a hole in the door. Rose does know that there's an army far bigger than anything they could handle on the other side of that door. In short, she should know full-well that stopping that Ram is the only thing that will keep the Resistance alive for more than an hour. Despite this, she willingly trades the lives of the entire Resistance for a moment's kiss with Finn (fittingly framed by the destruction of the door and, thus, the Resistance). But this isn't presented as a bad thing. In fact, she gets to give Finn a little lecture before conking out. Of course, this turns out OK for the Resistance, thanks to Luke's trick, the Rebellion's sloppy cartography skills, and Rey's mastery of the Force. But Rose knew about literally none of these things. So what are we to believe? All's well that ends well? If so, Poe was a hero in the opening battle. It was his determination to destroy the Dreadnaught (at the cost of ships and pilots who were all killed regardless of if they pulled back or not) that saved the entire Resistance sans-Rey. That sacrificing lives for glory is wrong? If so, Rose was wrong because she sacrificed the entire Resistance, including herself and Finn, just to get one romantic moment with him.</TEXT>

    <TITLE>The Raven Queen and Hexblades</TITLE>
    <DATE>2018-09-29 02:31:29</DATE>
    <TEXT>So I had a player and I work out the following lore to add the Raven Queen to the Forgotten Realms: In the Realms, those who die without a patron deity have their souls trapped in the Wall of the Faithless. There, their souls face utter oblivion. However, a new goddess has started to make it her habit to intervene on behalf of those without gods or goddesses of their own- the Raven Queen. Legends speak of the first soul to ever free itself from the Wall. Some say that she had aid from a being more powerful than the gods. Others say it was her own iron will that gave her the strength to break free. Regardless of the method, she now stands with divine energy and has called herself the Raven Queen, She Who Guards the Faithless. Whenever a non-evil soul is about to be bound to the Wall, she or one of her ravens will speak with them. She offers the same bargain to all- join her in the Shadowfell for eternity, leave your soul to oblivion on the Wall, or take up the shadow blade and become a hexblade knight. The last option, though, requires the greatest sacrifice- all hexblades return to Toril with absolutely no memory of their lives before beyond basic survival and language skills. To them, it is as though they are strangers in their own bodies, without even remembrance of the Raven Queen, herself. This amnesia is the result of a pact she made with the other deities. To them, she is anathema. Without the faith provided by those fearful of the Wall, they may lose a great deal of power. Knowing that they don't have to go to the Wall when they die may cause some to turn away from worship in life with the hope of escape in death. However, they are wary of attacking one who managed an impossible task, either by her own hand or with aid. So they struck a bargain- she cannot be known on the mortal side of Death's veil. She may guide her hexblades from afar, but cannot even directly approach her own warriors until they once more pass beyond life. Instead of direct communication, she can rely on indirect hunches and omens sent to the hexblade. He or she will see a raven circling a ruined tower and feel compelled to investigate, only to discover a cleric of an evil god enslaving the dead. Maybe the hexblade sees a face in a crowd that seems familiar, only to be drawn into investigating the smuggling of dark artifacts. The hexblade is restored to life in a brand new body. This may not match the species or gender of the original being, but is always humanoid and in the prime of that species' life. Some may start to have flashes of memory from their previous life, but many never recall anything past a few flashes of intense emotion. Under no circumstances can they recall meeting with the Raven Queen after death; they only remember dying and awakening (if they remember anything at all).</TEXT>

    <TEXT>First, before people jump on me, I know that there are people who love FFA. I actually like TDM, myself, so don't think that I'm criticizing any game mode.  #8203; However, Blizzard has now made two FFA modes where you can't pick your hero the two modes that give you bonus chests this event. As much as I would love to grind out loss after loss trying to get past Genji on hero progression, could we maybe include a team mode as a chest game as well? Or maybe somewhere that I can pick a hero instead of going with some of my worst against others' best? It's like being trapped in the least fun elements of mystery heroes again and again.  #8203; Overwatch is a team shooter at heart, and based around teams of players. Why is the Anniversary event (which should be celebrating the heart of Overwatch) spotlighting TWO modes which both completely remove the majority of what made Overwatch special?</TEXT>

I've been having fun upgrading him and decided to pick up the Flashback and Populate 2019 decks and upgrade them. Now I'm ready to start crafting my own deck from scratch to have a set of 4 I can bring to game days with friends. This deck was made primarily by looking at what I had available and throwing it together. The game plan is to drain opponents through creatures entering and leaving the battlefield. What I would appreciate would be some help in thinning out the lower performing cards and spotting upgrades that I can make sub-$5 or $10.

    <TEXT>So I was discussing TLJ with a friend and came up with a small script fix that could have solved some of the issues with TLJ and only required minor reshoots - Senator Holdo. The military command was on the bridge, while she was in her quarters. Since she's the highest rank according to Republic doctrine, she's thrust into command. Taking Holdo out of the military and putting her in the civilian side explains: Why is she wearing a gown on the bridge? *She was only supposed to be having a meeting with Leia when Hosnian Prime blew up.* Why doesn't Poe trust her? *She's a civilian with seemingly no crisis experience.* Why does she act haughty towards Poe? *She's unsure of herself commanding directly, and thinks that a good military commander should be obeyed without question.* Make her seem like an asshole, only to show how she is just as scared as Poe, and cares just as much for her people. Instead of her and Leia bonding over how much they like Poe, she could learn from Leia how being a Senator and General taught her to trust and confide in those around her.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I'm in the opposite boat as you. My family are all Democrats (parents are Sanders/Warren supporters, siblings are Warren/Buttigeg). Interestingly, both parents were Republican up to Obama (worked on the Reagan campaign together), but have drifted left over the years. When I lived with them for a short time, my Dad and I would get into very loud arguments over politics, and I felt very much as though my parents were "ganging up" on me and talking down to me (even though I was an adult veteran with as much formal education as either). Getting a new apartment did help ease friction between us, as did unfriending each other on social media. With other family members in our group, we can still keep up with the positive aspects of each other's lives without seeing any political posts (both of us are people who love to talk politics and hate to "lose" arguments). I hate to say it, but you may have to choose which is more important to you - your politics or your family. Now, I would make this reciprocal - no trying to shout you down or gang up on you, either. Make political discussions a no-go zone. There are thousands of other things you can talk about. You'll feel tempted to start steering them towards politics - avoid this temptation like the plague. From what you're describing, nobody's going to be changed by what you say, so it's better off avoiding the tension between real people you love and whose relationships you nurture.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Magic: The Story seems to be drawing less from narrative conventions than from card games ones. By this, I mean that the planeswalkers are created to individually break rules in specific ways. A card game has very specific rules, but individual cards allow us to modify them. I would wager that almost every rule of MtG has some card that alters/ignores it. This seems to be creeping into planeswalkers, too.</TEXT>

A slower singleton format allows me to put big flashy cards into my deck when they gather dust in the collection for Standard (looking at you, [[God-Eternal Oketra]]...).

I found that 3 years of working with a small town's Planning department more than prepared me for an entry level Planner I position, but I was also doing a lot of Planning gruntwork (site inspections, addressing, business tax receipts, and pulling files from the archives for the planners) along with my GIS work.

" And you had people -- and I #8217;m not talking about the neo-Nazis and the white nationalists -- because they should be condemned totally. But you had many people in that group other than neo-Nazis and white nationalists. Okay? And the press has treated them absolutely unfairly. "Now, in the other group also, you had some fine people. But you also had troublemakers, and you see them come with the black outfits and with the helmets, and with the baseball bats. You had a lot of bad people in the other group."

    <TEXT>It has. However, the deficit keeps ballooning out of control as the parties act like drunken college students at a kegger. We ascribe to the President mystical powers over the economy, but the economy generally does its own thing independent of D.C. Trump does well to (usually) get out of its way, but he isn't the engine behind the recent growth, he just doesn't act as much of an inhibitor as somebody like Obama was. The Federal budget, however, has far more to do with his actions (along with Congress, to be fair). Balancing our spending with our intake needs to be a big focus of his job, but neither he nor Pelosi seem to be eager to actually sit down in a room and work to bring it under control a-la Clinton and Gingrich. So sure, let him crow about the economy - he's earned it under our modern-day understanding of the economy. But don't pretend like the President who vowed to never sign another trillion dollar deficit (then signed one the very next year) is doing his part to help stave off financial hardships down the road.</TEXT>

For each of these releases, we get together in local gaming stores a week before the official release for a big prerelease event where we buy packs early and make decks with the new cards to play against each other. It's one of the most fun kinds of events in the game as it's hyper-relaxed and more about the fun of seeing the new cards and trying them out than serious competition.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>The US ignored the danger until the cases here started to get out of hand. The CDC woefully underestimated the amount of demand for critical supplies and tests. The early travel ban on China was decried as a racist maneuver that wouldn't do anything. The disease was downplayed as just another flu by government and media sources. This pattern repeats itself across most of the West. HOWEVER, that's nowhere in the ballpark of China's active attempts to silence anyone speaking out about the virus in the early stages, it's current efforts to (baselessly) blame the US government for creating the virus, and it's corruption of the WHO into a propaganda arm of the CCP. Just yesterday, a Japanese interview with doctors in Wuhan suggested that the lack of new cases there is due to the government not testing anyone (as a secondary spike in cases is seen in every other pandemic as people come out of isolation and start mingling again).</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Libertarianism as it's understood in the West (esp. the US) USUALLY\* says nothing of the sort. Libertarianism would certainly be against being FORCED by the government to give to your neighbor, but doesn't say anything about voluntary charity. The idea is that other people will be happy to allocate your resources to their clients to further their own power (for example: I buy votes with your money by promising to give it to young people in the form of student loan forgiveness). Voluntary transactions (either for profit or other reasons) tend to further develop a community by reducing resentment, allocating resources as fast as possible, and reacting on a person-to-person basis. \*As always, there are always people who believe the most extreme version of any philosophy.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I don't think we can do a 1:1 comparison of death tolls to be weighing scales. I do think we need to be realistic about how long isolation can last in the real world. We need a plan for how we're going to get back to normalcy. This quarantine stage, while necessary, cannot last 3-4 (or, God help us, 4-6!) months. We need to be looking at ramping up ICU capacity, testing, and creating targeted response plans like South Korea.</TEXT>

While still nebulous and prone to abuse, the other $425 bil would be subject to monthly reporting requirements to Congress (bipartisan committees).</TEXT>

    <TEXT>It's a wholly unfair strawman of an argument. The biggest problem is that we have a known and an unknown threat facing off, and both problems need to be weighed against each other. This pandemic is fairly unknown in terms of infectivity, severity, and lethality. On the other hand, shutting down the vast majority of the global economy is going to cause untold devastation to most people in the world and radically change the future in ways that people may very well come to regret. Coming from somebody who has been social distancing since before St. Patrick's Day, I agree that the immediate actions are needed. However, we also need a plan for getting back to normal. We can't just shut things down indefinitely. Not only will markets go insane with panic, but all of us locked in our homes can't live under effective house arrest with no end in sight. Our leadership needs to be developing strategies and timelines to get us back to work. Of course, those timelines can (and should) be adjusted as more information is known and we can see the effects of the current isolation.</TEXT>

I can also say, though, that sometimes these questions veer from "I want to understand supporters" to "I want supporters to denounce Trump". This has caused some supporters to try and get ahead of the questioners they think are fishing for attack fodder rather than asking in good faith. I know that, anecdotally, the highest-rated posts I have from this sub are usually the ones where I disagree with the President on an issue.</TEXT>

It's another to say that it's uniquely evil and must be wholly dismantled and reformed to its total opposite.

    <TEXT>I would tend to argue that the 20th Century was a determined march away from federalism towards centralized power, and the abdication of power by the legislature to the executive. We've created a high-stakes game where the Presidency is dominating more and more power, with the Supreme Court coming a close second. This seems to run contrary to the Constitution, where the President should have limited powers compared to Congress. We've been treating the President more and more like a monarch, and DC as the be-all-end-all of political power in the US.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>The CGI version is alright, but nowhere near as cinematic as Genndy Tartakovski can be. His Clone Wars blows anything Filloni has done out of the water when it comes to cinema. There's nothing comparable to moments like Mace Windu on the plains, or Anakin vs Asajj on Yavin IV. Tartakovski understands both quiet reflection and frantic, over-the-top action better than anybody on the latter series. His General Grievous is a terrifying force of nature that comes out of the shadows like a freaking nightmare and turns Jedi Masters into quivering puddles of fear. Lucas/Filloni Grievous is a moustache-twirling Saturday morning cartoon that the heroes barely break a sweat defeating.</TEXT>

His Green New Deal would make the US government the largest employer (in both absolute and % GDP) employer in the West. His immigration stances would make the EU look draconian in comparison.

    <TEXT>No. Reasonable pedestrian safety includes being aware of the entire roadway while you cross. Never assume anything when your life is on the line. Always make sure that you have positive checks on the entire road, make sure that the drivers see you and have stopped. You don't look away from oncoming traffic until you know that all lanes stopped or are on the other side (and you should check the wrong way once or twice before crossing just in case). Just because you have the right of way doesn't mean a ton of metal can't take you out of this world. Everyone needs to be aware that idiots exist and can easily hurt or kill you if you're not careful.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Any time the government permanently seizes your property, you must either be justly compensated for it or a jury of your peers has to find you guilty of a crime. I can understand seizing property used in the commission of a crime as evidence, but ONLY if that evidence is returned to its owner immediately after trial if that person is found not guilty of the crime for which the evidence is used by the prosecution (if the cops accuse you of selling drugs from your car, for example, but only get you on possession of a firearm when you are on probation, the car should be returned). And, of course, seizing property as a form of punishment after the person is found guilty of a crime, especially if that property was used in commission of said crime, is fairly traditional in UK/US law, so remains fairly uncontroversial as long as the seizure doesn't go overboard (seizing your house for unpaid parking tickets, for example). I do think that civil asset forfeiture is a fairly unpopular practice across the board, in the same way that other revenue-generation schemes by law enforcement (speed traps, for example) are. It's just one that many people don't think about in their daily lives because it affects a very small portion of the population (and yes, that portion is more heavily minority partially because minority communities, in general, have more interactions with police and partially because there are racist police officers).</TEXT>

    <TEXT>My point was that it's very hard for a normal player (or even experienced players) to tell at a glance that a deck has more than the legal number of copies of a card without looking at the entirety of the deck. It is, conversely, easy to tell if a player plays a card that breaks a companion's requirements (much like you can easily tell when a player breaks color restrictions in Commander), as they're clear-cut and common knowledge. You seem to think that it's hard to prove when a player plays a card restricted by their companion. I'd argue that it's far easier to catch somebody cheating like that - the instant I see a 2 CMC creature in a deck that can only have 3+ CMC spells, I call BS and make the other player forfeit either their spell (if it's friendly/casual and this is an honest mistake) or the game (if it's competition or the person is abusing it).</TEXT>

It's getting to be an article of faith that places like MI (3,274 deaths w/ 10 mil pop.) did a much better job than FL (1,055 deaths w/ 21.5 mil pop.) simply based on ever-increasing draconian lockdowns, and that'scoming from someone who supports shutdowns and mandatory social distancing.</TEXT>

Honestly, I think he failed quite a bit at the testing/prep stage, routinely fails at communication, and needs to let his pandemic team lead if he doesn't want to take the time to actually learn what they have to say. Not to mention that, as head of government, the buck famously stops with him. With that said, I don't think he is entirely to blame, even within the US.</TEXT>

Why did the Mayor of New York tell everyone to go out on the town in mid/late March? It's not that I want to excuse Trump of blame.

    <TEXT>Interested to see how this develops. Trump is hammered every day (rightly and wrongly), while Biden is practically invisible by comparison. If the theory holds that the candidate who is the focus of attention loses, Biden may be quietly propelled into the White House. If, however, the two go out in public again this year, I think Biden is going to shoot himself in the foot. I don't think there's two more gaffe prone politicians than these two men, but I'm starting to be legitimately concerned about how badly Biden is slipping on things compared to 2008-16. Ultimately, though, I think Trump's second term chances live or die on how the public views his COVID response. If we are coming back in November, he is very likely to win. If things are still miserable and deaths remain high, he may be out of a job.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>"Never interrupt your enemy when he is making a mistake." Don't know if Napoleon, Sun Tzu, or some random person came up with this quote, but I think it describes the Democrats' strategy. Trump draws all fire to himself like a reverse moth - and the press is eager to make the story about him saying stupid things or having hissy fits. Also, 538 was fairly close to the total votes, but American Presidential elections are strange in that a few counties going different ways snowballs into one candidate winning the popular vote but losing the election. Polls are just guides, but ignoring them is just as foolish as taking them as Gospel.</TEXT>

Looks like we got shafted.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Your first point is true only if: 1. You take deaths as absolute, not per-capita. The US death toll, despite being an absolutely horrific number, represents just over 21 deaths per 100,000 population. The UK is just over 43, and Belgium is suffering a death rate over 69 deaths per 100k. 2. You ignore Russia and China (and other nations) basically making up whatever numbers they want. China, for example, is only reporting 4.6k deaths, despite being the epicenter of the disease, having a massive population, and letting it spread for weeks throughout the city.  #8203; Your second point is wholly false, no matter if you look at testing rates or absolute numbers. **ABSOLUTE** The US has performed 7.4 million tests so far. The next most performed by a trustworthy nation is Germany at 2.5 million. The US has done almost as many tests alone as has Germany, Italy, Spain, and France combined. **PER 1 MLLION** The US has tested 22,591 out of every 1 million people. The UK has tested 19,026. France is at 16,856. Currently, Mexico has only tested 776 out of every 1 million people.

    <TEXT>Assuming no births/deaths (ha!), the US population currently stands at 331 million people. At $1000/month, we're spending $331 billion/month. Each year would be $3.972 trillion. The 2020 defense budget was $721.5 billion. Taking 10% would give us $72.15 billion to spend on this new benefit. Each year (again, assuming no change in numbers), we would have a budget shortfall of: $3,972,000,000-$72,150,000,000, or $68.178 billion dollars. Now, to be VERY generous, I'll assume that we take 10% EVERY YEAR, rather than just take it once. Otherwise, you're paying a $39.72 trillion bill with a measly $72.15 billion, leaving you $39,000,000,000,000.00+ in the hole.</TEXT>

Personally, the most annoying was the Obamacare rollout. My college I worked for cut hours for all student employees because of the health insurance requirement. I was a TA and worked night shift at the bar/bowling alley picking up about 30-35 hours per week. Once Obamacare hit, we were restricted because the school didn't have enough to cover everyone's insurance (even though I had insurance through my GI Bill). Rather predictably, they cut hours for all student employees across the board and I lost about 5-10 hours/week.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>1) Strongly against it. For the minimal force we had, we were able to project a fair amount of power and some measure of stability. I have sympathy for the Kurds as the one force not trying to screw us hard in Iraq, and dislike Turkey for many reasons, so I'm for an independent Kurdistan. 2) I think it was emblematic of how botched the rollout was over many years and how complex the issue can be. While I don't think insurance should depend on your employer, I also don't think it should be on the state/federal government, either. In my utopia, it would be closer to coverage for catastrophic issues while routine checks and services could be handled at point of service between customer and provider directly (similar to car insurance). You could then purchase upgrade packages from your insurer to expand coverage as needed/wanted. HOWEVER - I'm not a health care expert, and fully acknowledge the idea is utopian. It would almost certainly have problems I don't know about.</TEXT>

And nobody can doubt that stupid people must be taught (by force, if necessary) while evil ones must be punished. This mindset fueled the Soviet Union and sent millions to their deaths in brutal prison camps.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Not the point. No single day has seen 3k people die at once. The deaths are spread out, and humans have evolved to give far more weight to immediate threats than long term solutions. For example - we treat COVID with far more seriousness than traffic fatalities for much the same reason. We build up tolerances as threats persist over time, which we need to keep from going insane with anxiety. The side effect will always be that systemic issues always seem less bad than immediate events. And on the good side of things, it looks like the US is on the down slope of COVID compared to last month.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Young, healthy people are very much not at serious risk for COVID. That's not to say there's a 0% risk, but people below 30 make up a tiny fraction of a fraction of serious cases and deaths. According to the CDC, there have been only 551 deaths in the US of people aged 34 and younger as of May 20. This is approximately 0.8% of the total number of deaths over that same timeframe. Hell, there were fewer than 100 deaths below age 25. More people over the age of 85 have died of COVID than under 65. While it is very prudent to avoid transmitting the disease to those in more vulnerable groups, you shouldn't need to be panicked that you'll die if you catch this.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Please don't think I'm downplaying the horror of seeing somebody close to you die of this disease. But also realize that we're going to need to make risk calculations based on actual numbers, not just anecdotes. And the actual numbers seem to suggest that we protect the elderly and sick, but that the vast majority of people in their 30s and younger will come through this. We shouldn't rush out and just open willy-nilly, but we shouldn't be huddled away in our bunkers fearing for our lives, either. Focusing on unlikely death scenarios and blowing them up to near-certainties is a good way to start developing wildly unhealthy coping strategies. Learning to maturely assess personal risk and take steps to mitigate it is far healthier.</TEXT>

Deaths look even better at only 19.14 / 100k (0.019%). Source: [https://www1.nyc.gov/site/doh/covid/covid-19-data.page](https://www1.nyc.gov/site/doh/covid/covid-19-data.page) While every death is terrible, this disease is primarily killing our elderly.

    <TEXT>Couple of corrections: 1. The lockdown orders were to keep ICUs and ERs from becoming overwhelmed like Italy and Spain. When we went into lockdown in March, the understanding was that we needed to flatten the curve, not that we were in until a vaccine was created. While there are promising results on the horizon, nothing will be available until the end of the year at the absolute earliest. 2. The recession is being caused by the isolation. That isn't to say isolating isn't needed, or that it shouldn't have been implemented, but that's the direct reason for recession. Now the virus was the reason for the lockdowns, so you can say that it is the cause as well, but that's just being accurate. 3. Breaking all social distancing is the fastest way to get this over with. It also comes with horrible casualty rates and is generally unacceptable to the vast majority of us (including myself). Flattening the curve was specifically designed to make the infection period last longer so that the peak was far lower and we didn't overwhelm our health care system. And finally, I'm not trying to downplay anything. I'm also not trying to hype people into a spiral of despair, either. r/Coronavirus would have everyone believe that stepping outside to see your friend is going to murder everyone you love. You hear the most horrible, exaggerated cases for keeping all of America on virtual house arrest for the next year or two. The reality is that the lockdowns are coming to an end. We need to learn to deal with risks (maintaining social distancing, wearing masks indoors, etc.) while trying to salvage what we can and do everything in our power to protect the elderly and vulnerable (special shopping hours, limiting nursing home visitors, etc.).</TEXT>

Sending out ballots to people who didn't ask for them and won't care about what happens to them (say, not making it to the person) makes me nervous, at least. If I can have four separate GameFly games stolen in the mail, I don't think ballot theft is that strange. Add to that the low turnout numbers in most elections and no tracking for individual ballots (something that would invalidate our system of secret voting) and you have the potential for fraud that would be very hard to detect.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Anybody who's worked retail knows how often you'll get somebody screaming in your face (figuratively and literally, sadly) when you tell them something they don't want to hear. Now imagine that, instead of telling them that they can't return the box of cards they literally went out to their car to take the expensive ones out of, your job is to fine/arrest people who may be under the influence, may be violent, and absolutely are certain that they've done absolutely nothing wrong.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>We've had authoritarians in charge since Coolidge left office. Just because the authoritarian is going things you like, doesn't mean they're any less so. Trump is the Nero to Obama's Augustus - he says the quiet parts out loud. The media dislike him, so they actually do their job of holding him to account. Obama was authoritarianism wrapped in a cool, smiling package that the media loved to admire. It's why, despite their flaws, we need something like a Fox News. It's too easy to give people a pass if you like them.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I spent eight years from 2008-16 watching media outlets almost willfully turning a blind eye to authoritarianism, only getting their vision back when the authoritarian had the proper party affiliation to go after. Fox is biased, but that causes them to hold politicians to account who might be ignored by those who agree with them. Authoritarianism is party neutral. Saying that you have the unilateral power to pass legislation from the executive branch because the legislature isn't giving you what you want is 100% authoritarian.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Allow me to clarify my point. 1) Antifa are claiming that they are good because they are anti-fascist. The image of Allied troops landing at Normandy has been labeled as antifa to associate the modern group with the heroism and general popularity of the troops involved in the war against Nazism. 2) Elsewhere, I have said that modern antifa are more akin to Joseph Stalin, another anti-fascist whose views on society more closely resemble antifa and their boosters than the other major Allied nations. I have been told that Stalin was a fascist, so obviously they would have been against him. 3) Winston Churchill, one of the most influential men in the greatest fight against literal fascists, has his statue defaced by the groups from point 1. I point to the hypocrisy of saying that a group must be good because they're anti-fascist while simultaneously saying that one of Hitler's most strident and consistent adversaries should have his memory damned. At this point, I'm not 100% sure if I'm being gaslit or not.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Most of America was designed to be governed at the lowest possible level. How many people here know any of the members of their city/county council? When was the last time you actually took the time to write to them? Having worked in local government, my eyes were opened to how a small group of dedicated voters (in our case, a single gated community) can have a dramatic impact on how the city makes decisions. Do you know who reps you at your state legislature? Do you have any idea how many laws that affect your life are passed by them? By making everything a life-or-death struggle for the White House, we're encouraging people to cling to some terrible people because they're afraid of the other side gaining the ultimate prize.</TEXT>

Had an Indian History class that was a great experience that introduced me to facets of the culture I never knew existed. Had an African American History class where the professor literally allowed one of the students to give a presentation on African exploration of the New World pre-Columbus based entirely on pseudo history conspiracies without saying a word about historical accuracy. I can understand a controversial presentation sliding by without overt challenge, as long as the scholarship behind it was sound, but this was just "I found this site on Google" level of research.</TEXT>

No, Trump will not lose graciously and will spend the rest of his life complaining that the election was stolen. The same holds for the vast majority of his supporters.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I would be far more sympathetic if I hadn't seen it happen the last two times Democrats ceded the White House to Republicans. Both George W. Bush and Donald Trump came into office with a good chunk of the Democratic Party convinced they stole their position. I fully expect that whichever party loses 2020 is going to declare the election fraudulent. We spent three years trying to get to the bottom of 2016, and the Democratic Party didn't seem to happy that Mueller didn't find the election to have been run from Moscow (not excusing Trump's actions during the investigation, but it seems less like foreign malice and more Trump's impetuous nature at having people question his victory). Stacey Abrams is literally only in the VP running because people tell us that she is the real governor of Georgia (NOT re-fighting that issue, by the way - take it up with the State of Georgia or FEC if you have proof that she really won). Is this harmful to social harmony in the US? Absolutely. But I don't have any illusions that either side will let that tactic go unused starting the moment the election is called for the other side.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Sure. And there are more reasonable gripes (e.g., we should reform/abolish the Electoral College to better represent popular vote totals), but claiming that the other side is engaged in criminal deeds to win leads to an arms race where you ignore the bad things your side does because "the other side is doing waaay worse things and we have to beat them at their own game!" I look at a place like r/politics, where large numbers of liberals are absolutely convinced that they lose everything because they play by the rules and the Republicans cheat all the time. Then I go to a place like The Federalist where the conservatives are convinced that they lose everything because they play by the rules and the Democrats cheat all the time.</TEXT>

Remember that motive (whether an act was racist or not) is judged in the trial phase by a jury of one's peers.

    <TEXT>That depends on what the person is doing that is considered racist. Take the Confederate flag, for example. Reddit considers everyone who flies it to be doing so because they hate minorities and long for the days of slavery. Many, however, have taken it to be pride in their heritage (a very human trait that most of us share) and a sense of freedom and independence. You may not see it that way, but that doesn't mean that your interpretation of the flag and its history is what they think of it.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I tend to be fairly Trump-skeptical, but I can really respect people like David French who are very anti-Trump but maintain their core values. (I would also recommend reading Jonah Goldberg) The Lincoln Project folks have gone wholly Democratic. They cheer Democratic Party wins, support Democratic Party candidates, and seem less devoted to preserving conservative values than hating Donald Trump. The biggest disappointment as a former Never Trumper was seeing McMullin, whom I voted for, make himself only into an anti-Trump figure. I want Trump to be better, and will call out what he does wrong, but I'll also support him when he does positive things.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I think that was the initial drive, yes. That's why I brought up French and Goldberg. Neither one likes Trump, but they seem to come at their positions in a way that comports with their political values before Trump joined the Birthers (his entrance into national politics). The Lincoln Project people seem more interested in attacking Trump, and will therefore cheer positions they stood against in the name of putting the Democratic Party into power.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Hybrid cards are one spell with an AND/OR clause ( [[Shielding Plax]] is Green OR Blue, OR Green AND Blue). Hybrid mana was created specifically to expand colors - that's why they aren't the same as multicolored ones. Split cards are two spells. One is one color, the other is another. If the spells were separate, one would be disallowed. When you can cast both sides with Fuse, like Wear / Tear, you have to pay White AND Red, so it's not an OR situation. (EDIT: Tried to think of a hybrid card off the top of my head, forgot that it had activated abilities with both colors. Plax is a better example.)</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Security. Nobody can look at your post history to track you down. This is a double-edged sword. For many, it is a way that they can share sensitive information without risking it getting back to people who can harm them. For example, the people who play at this person's store may be on this sub and track her down to mock her IRL. On the other hand, some bad actors can use it to disguise evidence that they're not being honest. For example, a poor black kid asking for donations to see a show may have posted that they're a 40-something CEO, 12 year old schoolgirl, and a dozen other identities that give them sympathy/respect in a given conversation.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>First Sergeant Tremir was on the front lines of the Dreadhorde Invasion. For many years, he and his giant cohort had drilled against everything from Rakdos rioters to an outbreak of Simic Krasisi, but nothing compared to the eerie ferocity of the lazotep-clad zombies pouring forth into the city. As they had always done, the disciplined giants of the Boros held the front lines with their mighty warclubs and thick armor, yet the surprisingly nimble and skilled undead found every gap in their protection, and their khopeshes were covered in a wicked poison that slowed the giants' limbs and resolve, causing one after the other to fall to their doom as the horde literally overran their bodies like a grotesque Golgari bug swarm. Seeing the men and women with whom he had bonded falling around him, good people whose names were indelibly etched into his soul, broke the big giant. He let out a powerful roar of defiance, a deafening clarion call of rage and sorrow powerful enough to shatter the oncoming horde like glass. At that moment, First Sergeant Tremir became aware of his body being torn violently from his home plane and sent screaming into some strange land, where spires of metal filigree arose like delicate blooms from a city not unlike his own, only to be ripped painfully back to Ravnica in a blink of an eye as the inexorable pull of the Immortal Sun caught him in its grasp.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>While I support mask wearing and do so when going inside any business I don't plan to eat at, I don't think we can do a national mask order for the following reasons: 1) No real power for the federal government to do so. Local and state governments may have this power, but the fed should just stick with issuing guidance and playing a support role. 2) Adding more crimes necessitates more police interactions to enforce fines. Such enforcement seems to fall disproportionately on minority communities. Look at NYC cracking down on Blacks, Hispanics, and Jews gathering during April while ignoring a park full of white hipsters.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Teysa's heels clicked a sharp, angry rhythm as she descended level after level through catacombs as old as her guild. Tomik, ever attentive to his superior's moods, said nothing as they ventured through the dim corridors, though even his normally stoic face betrayed just a hint of curiosity. When the guildmistress had told him they needed a "specialist" to handle the problems caused by the recent invasion, he had started to reach out to the various functionaries of the guild's less... savory duties. But before he could even summon the first leg breaker, she had instead ordered him to carry a sealed debt scroll and follow her down to the catacombs. She had used her guild signet to open what he had thought was a sealed crypt, only to reveal the cobwebbed corridor that they now traveled down, lit only by spectral torches hovering just above their heads. After traveling down further than he thought possible, even in the Grand Cathedral, they arrived at a circular chamber perhaps 20 feet across, with a domed ceiling that extended past Tomik's poor night vision. He was surprised to find that they had company - one of the guild's powerful giants held a shivering man, his once-fine blue and red robes immediately marking him as an Izzet mage, though not one in high standing. He winced, knowing that he would have to tell Ral about this tonight. Even if the man was outcast, Tomik's husband still cared about what happened to any who represented his guild. He idly wondered if Teysa knew, if she was somehow testing to see exactly where his loyalty lay between his guild and his love. If that was the case, he was resolved to show her nothing she could use against him. "Hand me the scroll," she ordered, extending one black-gloved hand towards him. Ever the faithful assistant, he produced it from his voluminous robes. It was a standard Orzhov debt marker - the kind that a shop keeper might have for an initial investment. The parchment was sealed with the guild insignia, which Guildmistress Teysa Karlov snapped with one finger. "Korlov Treska. By authority of the Orzhov Guild, and my position of Holder of Debt," she pronounced, her words echoing ominously in the dark chamber, "I am calling in that which you owe." The captive mage started shaking uncontrolably as his marker was called. Ancient magics, supported by the Guildpact, itself, demanded the debtor pay what was owed. He could only stammer in response. "P-please, your Grace, I...I...I need more t-time! T-the reagants, they were st-stolen by the Tin Street gang! I c-can get you the money - I just nee-need more t-time!" "Debtor," pronounced Teysa, not a single facial tic showing any sort of sympathy for a plea they both had heard from countless other beings, "You are found delinquent. As Holder of Debt, I have determined that you need not repay us as a spirit." The words surprised both Tomik and Korlov. Indentured spirits were one of the guild's most useful tools - and allowing one to go free was considered the ultimate waste of resources. What could she be up to? The answer came swiftly as a curt nod from the Guildmistress to the giant guard gave him the signal to produce his knife - a three-foot blade of wickedly sharp steel. With a single practiced move, the giant ran the blade almost gently across the mage's neck. He was unable to even cry out in pain as his blood flowed free, only a bubbling gargle marked his last words. Tomik, though not afraid to get dirty when needed, still stepped back as the crimson blood flowed into the design of the Orzhov Guild etched on the floor. Teysa merely craned her neck skyward. He was startled to hear the sound of chains rattling in the hidden heights of the dome. What sort of prisoner was chained to the ceiling? "Karlov," came a harsh whisper, as though coming from a throat long-unused to speech, "Why have you awoken me?" "The Guild has need of you once more," said Teysa, her voice firm and commanding. She produced another marker, this one written on gold leaf and sealed with a silver band. "As Holder of Debt, it is time you repaid us for past treachery." An inhuman shriek blasted the chamber. Tomik was forced to his knees, clutching at his ears in pain. Even the giant staggered, dropping the mage's corpse into his own bloody pool and trying in vain to plug the ear holes of his helmet. Only Teysa remained firm and unyielding as an alabaster statue in the darkness. With a powerful impact, a creature slammed into the ground from the darkness above. Almost 8 feet tall, its appearance was a hideous amalgamation of bat and man. It towered over Teysa, who met its gaze with the same determination she had shown staring down the Ghost Council before. It only took a minute of the showdown for the creature to shrink from her gaze and drop to its knees, lapping at the blood like a dog. As Tomik rose, he noticed the beast changing form. Where once was a monster, now stood a rather handsome man with pale, aqualine features and clothes of ancient nobility. The vampire stood once more, wiping stray blood from his chin. "So," he said with measured gaze leveled at Teysa, "What is it you wish of me?" "It was said that you possessed the power to leave Ravnica for... other places. Is this true?" "True enough," he replied with a brief nod, "In my day, I traveled to many planes of existence. But I thought your ancestors didn't believe my tales of strange worlds where parks exist untamed and districts are only a few dozen buildings." "Let us just say that we are more...open to tales of outside worlds than we once were." "So, do you wish me to travel the planes? If so, I'll need more than what that pitiful wreck could provide. I haven't eaten in far too long." Teysa motioned to the giant. "He's yours, Old One. Finish him and meet me upstairs. We have much to discuss."</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Ah, you're awake. Excellent. You were 2.31 hours of unconsciousness away from a level of permanent brain damage that might have rendered you incapable of comprehending speech. Oh, don't bother to get up. The bindings are quite tight. Yes, I did search your personage and yes, I did find the picks you kept up your robe. Ah, and by that twitch I can surmise that you are discovering that I also relieved you of the poison capsule in the false tooth. ...and now you see I removed the other poison capsule. Dear girl, please try not to insult my intelligence. Though lesser beings may confuse me for a crude beast, I assure you that I have ascended far past what little your skulking rogues' guild could ever hope to achieve. I was not always such a magnificent being, you know. Yes, even as mighty a personage as myself came from humble beginings. Yet I was chosen by the great Niv Mizzet, himself! It was he who saw my potential from a young age, guided my path through my brief period of apprenticeship, who approved of my master's thesis. He saw a kindred soul, even chained behind the frail form of a base primate. And I repaid his faith with devotion. While my "peers" contented themselves to studying unthinking lightning or base elementals, I turned my eyes towards the heavens, themselves. I sought out all that I could learn about the mighty gods that flew above us, that ruled my guild and my soul. None have conducted more thorough investigations into the nature of the dragon as I! And yet, when I presented my greatest work to my master, do you know what he did?! HE SPURNED ME! ME, his most worshipful attendant! And for what? Hubris? I showed him that I KNEW he had chosen me to be his offspring. I knew about his cloning technology, and had reverse-engineered it so that his draconic essence could improve my pitiful human one! And he had the GALL to say my theories were unworkable! Well, I showed him! BEHOLD! I am ascended unto dragonhood by mine own hand! Mad? Do you look upon this divine manifestation of elemental fury and call me mad? ...of course, I am still a work in progress. All great science is perfectable, you understand. Certainly, when I rebuild my machine, I will make it perfect. I understand the flaws, you see, I know how to improve for the next time. But until I can, I must ask a simple boon of you. You see, I am not wholly dragon yet. There are still some pathetic human organs within my divine frame. These organs... they do not quite have the same might as the dragon body, and are prone to failure. Thus, I need replacements - a kidney and liver in this case. Now I've tried working with the Golgari, but dead flesh does nothing to sustain me. I need fresh organs, preferably harvested while the donor still lives. Ah, your struggles show that you can comprehend. Be at peace, knowing your death brings a new light of perfection into this world. Be at peace...</TEXT>

Day 7: Subject has increased in mass by 340%. When pod decanted for checkup, could see glimmer of intelligence. Appears to be developing shoulders - arms to follow? Ape genes were inspired. Perhaps add elf next cycle? Day 21: Subject now larger than growth-chamber guardians. Arms fully developed. Intelligence detected after subject requested information on whereabouts. Interesting - first krasis to develop language. Will christen new species "Naga". Day 40: Subject has named itself "Vramardi". Unknown origin of name. Subject shows aptitude with weapons training. Growth stabilized at 4 meters, with subject's head carried 2.5 meters off ground. Need to ensure loyalty before moving to deployment. Day 41: Subject escaped conditioning pod via unknown teleportation. Bio signs do not register within any district. Though impossible, it appears as if subject is no longer to be found on Ravnica.

She hadn't felt this good since she was a child - so carefree she feared that she may fly off the cobblestones and into the smoke-choked skies above. So taken was she with the chaos that she didn't notice the silver spear plunging downwards towards her head, until at the last moment it was snached out of the air by mighty jaws as Nana launched her hundred-pound frame off her back and into the skies to grab the Boros Skyjack in her fearsome bite and slam her assailant to the ground. Syn joined her wolf sister in dismembering the annoyance, the blood mingling with the fresh coat of warpaint she had applied shortly before joining the fun. Little Domri Rade pushed them further into the hated city, towards the strange ebony edifice that had sprung up from the surroundings like the jaws of a trap on the unwary. While the other guilds may have joined in the defense of this hideous abomination called Ravnica, Rade had shown them that the time was ripe for the Raze-Boar to return the land to its true state. These were not invaders, he counseled, but liberators! By joining their rampage, the Clans would make quick work of this evil place and usher in a new era of natural dominance. The song on her lips joined the building symphony in her heart as Azorius arbiters and Rakdos rioters alike fell to her axe and her sister's teeth. They were pushing to the very heart of evil - the Guildpact would fall and everything would be made right again! Her exultation once again caused her focus to slip. A single dart shot from a hidden alleyway, aimed directly at her head. Before she could turn or duck, Nana was there again, her fur shielding her elven sister. With a pitiful yelp, the missile struck deep, disgorging a potent toxin derived from the worst fungal rot the Golgari could brew. Syn felt the world shatter as her bonded sister, whom she had cared for since the latter was no larger than her hand, convulsed with enough power that Syn could hear bones snapping. Sickly green foam flew from the wolf's muzzle, and her amber eyes bulged in unimaginable pain. Syn collapsed along with her sister, trying to comfort the beast as her thrashing lost more and more strength, until her life essence drooled out of her maw and into the dark sewers below.</TEXT>

While the government is expressly forbidden from establishing an official state religion (as was the norm in almost every country in the 18th Century), there are no restrictions against people practicing their religious beliefs in public (with exceptions where that practice infringes on the constitutional rights of others - slavery is still illegal, regardless of what any church may say).</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Come listen, my friends, to the tale of the Cat, And of his once-master, a dastardly rat. A drunkard, a lush, with the Golgari Rash ,A cruel vicious man ever quick with the lash.  #8203; Tis' said, and is true, that he never loved man, Always scheming to charge as much as he can. Yet one beast alone he kept near his heart, Merchant, the cat, and he never did part.  #8203; Till one day, it's said, the man made fatal flaw, A Rakdos blood witch he showed into his stall. He showed her his wares, priceless and gaudy, Enough to impress even her, ever haughty.  #8203; Yet when the bargaining came to brass tacks, The proper deference to her did he lack. Insulted, she turned and with woeful curse, Promised him he had not yet seen her worst.  #8203; "Rat" did she name him, and rat he became, But only this change would have been rather tame. For now the rat realized its terrible doom, His beloved cat's dinner he became very soon.  #8203; And Merchant, the cat, ate him up in one bite, Yet the changed man's essence didn't sit all that right. Instead it infused him with man's form quite mighty, With eyes of pure amber and fangs sharp and whitey.  #8203; So off to the shadows the beast man did flee, With dreams of the treasures that out there could be. A villainous crew of cats at his call, And a horde of gold sits pon' his paw.</TEXT>

Now, I can understand that it was a white lie to keep stocks reserved for the most critical needs and avoid hoarding, but think about the credibility damage that noble lie caused. Every time the experts lie, or they ignore their own policies in favor of a political cause, they hurt the general public by sowing mistrust in actual science.

    <TEXT>The Biden accusation came from a person with a known connection to him, who provided a specific time and place where the alleged incident occurred. We have contemporaneous evidence that she told others her story at the time. This is also a man with repeated public incidents of being "touchy-feely" with women to an unusual degree (see the Daily Show segment for somebody pro-Democratic Party talking about it). None of that applies to the first Kavanaugh accusation (and latter ones became increasingly less rational). A nonpartisan examination of the evidence provided by both sides would be hard-pressed to see why one man should be considered a rapist while the other is innocent. I honestly don't see enough evidence to justify saying either man did what they were accused of.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>What I was saying was that it's hard to hit people in the head using actual ammunition, which is going to be more accurate than LTL rounds. When you're aiming to stop a person, a rubber bullet to the chest is going to do just about as good a job with far more accuracy than trying to hit a moving head. I also stated that the reason we hear about all these reports of people being hit in the head is that only head hits are widely reported. Nobody is going on national news for getting a welt on their upper arm, for example. If you've ever shot at anything beyond paper or pop-ups, especially in an active situation, you would know that nobody with any actual experience goes for headshots as opposed to body shots. Some of those will miss and hit nothing. Others might miss and hit arms or legs. And a few will miss and hit the head. The law of large numbers basically guarantees that there will be headshots after enough rounds are fired. To say that they're purposefully aiming for the head would require one of the following: Official doctrine training police to shoot at the head A summary of total numbers of rounds fired with the hit rates for various body parts and misses So in conclusion, please try to understand an argument before accusing somebody of shit logic.

For example, just looking at intelligence tests would seem to suggest that Caucasians and Asians are smarter than Blacks or Hispanics, when what we're seeing could (and most likely is) more of a result of the tests being designed by Caucasians with built-in biases that favor people from their cultural background. Be very careful when you read a study that "proves" that people you don't like are measurably worse (stupider, more selfish, less moral, etc.) than people you agree with.

    <TEXT>The one consistent element of Luke's character in all three OT films is that he would stop at nothing to do what was right. He couldn't sit by in the Death Star while Leia was imprisoned, he couldn't stay in Dagobah when all of his friends were suffering in Bespin, and he couldn't leave Han to Jabba. In every stage of his life, he's been the person to accept responsibility to make things right. The only thing he values even close to his friends is the Force and the legacy of the Jedi. Now, as an old man, he's given up on the galaxy and decided to just live the rest of his life cut off from all of his friends, family, allies, and the Force. He's completely changed on a major character axis. You CAN do this, but you need serious groundwork - not just a throwaway line or two. We had two movies worth of development to show how Anakin could fall to the Dark Side and become what he hated, but now Luke Skywalker gets a single minute to show a closely related fall?</TEXT>

    <TEXT>There's nothing in the movies that says or shows what you wrote there. Correction - there WAS something to that effect in the cut content, about a Jedi needing to understand the situation entirely before rushing in to save the day, but that was cut for time (man, would have been nice to get some Luke character development or explanation over anything involving Canto Byte or DJ). That's the problem I have with TLJ over everything else - characters and situations absolutely break canon and everyone scrambles to retcon it or explain it to try and have it make some sense when compared with everything that came before. We absolutely need to see more of why Luke is a different man in TLJ than he was when we last saw him, because his character's journey was the central pivot around which the entire Star Wars universe was built. A combined minute or so of one scene which feels wildly out of place for the man we saw at the end of RotJ doesn't justify why Luke would not only turn his saber on his nephew, but then turn his back on the galaxy and his friends to wallow in misery for the rest of his days. If Luke had joined with Rey to teach her (could be reluctant - not just a carbon copy of Yoda), we could have learned more of his backstory as he fills the viewers in on the critical junctures in his training of Ben. We could have seen what Luke saw, not just been told he saw darkness, but maybe shown what would push the man who forgave Vader to give up on his nephew.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>No, they can still engage with society. I support prison work programs and educational opportunities. I think that we have a horrifying recidivism rate and do want to help those prisoners who can be reached turn their lives around. Just like you forfeit the right to keep and bear arms when you've proven you don't care about the social contract, you also lose the right to have direct influence in how that contract is carried out. You can still write letters or give speeches, petition the government for the redress of wrongs, and keep your own religious practices (within reason - you can have a chaplain of your faith visit you or have what items you need to perform your ceremonies that aren't potentially dangerous, for example). None of those either pose a threat (the reason for the loss of 2A rights for felons) or provide you with direct say in how your punishment will be carried out. Here is a list of countries with felon voting restrictions (no restriction, can't vote in prison, can't vote again, etc.). While every state is unique, the US as a whole seems somewhat standard to a little strict when it comes to felon voting restrictions. [https://felonvoting.procon.org/international-comparison-of-felon-voting-laws/](https://felonvoting.procon.org/international-comparison-of-felon-voting-laws/) [https://felonvoting.procon.org/state-felon-voting-laws/](https://felonvoting.procon.org/state-felon-voting-laws/) I just don't see any strong link between voting (a duty that a large percentage of Americans shirk anyway) and recidivism.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I mean, the UK doesn't allow felons to vote while incarcerated, and has a recidivism rate of around 28% to the US's 40%. Canada has a recidivism rate around 35%. So again, whether felons can vote while imprisoned doesn't seem to be connected to recidivism. I am curious to see if you can provide statistics proving your claims, though.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>New York has had 8x the deaths of Florida and looks like the exact worst-case scenario we were warned about in March - a short-lived, high peak infection that kills far more because it overwhelms the hospitals. Notice that the "bad" curve sharply drops off as the vulnerable have died and everyone else has already been infected, while the "good" curve slowly rises as lockdowns abate. This is almost exactly what we see comparing NY to FL.

    <TEXT>For people wondering, this is exactly the pattern we were warned about in March. New York had a massive spike in cases early on, with hundreds of thousands infected and tens of thousand dead. Now they're seeing swift case number drop-offs, as the virus has already burned through most of the vulnerable populations. Here's the famous "flatten the curve" model of controlling infections. New York fits the red curve almost perfectly, with a sharp spike in cases early on with a swift decline. Florida and California seem to be on the blue curve, with lower cases initially and more as lockdowns relax.

Going back 30 years, both sides have argued that this shouldn't happen (and, thankfully, it's so rare that Garland was the first test case in decades). I really hope that RBG is fine, and I know that she's in remarkably good health. I absolutely do not wish her death, as I know how painful it is to those who love her closest to have someone pass, even at an advanced age (and she's nowhere near as old as she can be!). With that said, if something does happen to a justice between now and election day, I'd be fine. If it happened after election totals revealed a Trump defeat and Senate loss (the "lame duck"), I'd say that it went against the expressed wishes of the voters and should be blocked.</TEXT>

This, in turn, places children and adolescents at considerable risk of morbidity and, in some cases, mortality. Beyond the educational impact and social impact of school closures, there has been substantial impact on food security and physical activity for children and families. Policy makers must also consider the mounting evidence regarding COVID-19 in children and adolescents, including the role they may play in transmission of the infection. SARS-CoV-2 appears to behave differently in children and adolescents than other common respiratory viruses, such as influenza, on which much of the current guidance regarding school closures is based. Although children and adolescents play a major role in amplifying influenza outbreaks, to date, this does not appear to be the case with SARS-CoV-2. Although many questions remain, the preponderance of evidence indicates that children and adolescents are less likely to be symptomatic and less likely to have severe disease resulting from SARS-CoV-2 infection. In addition, children may be less likely to become infected and to spread infection. Policies to mitigate the spread of COVID-19 within schools must be balanced with the known harms to children, adolescents, families, and the community by keeping children at home. Finally, policy makers should acknowledge that COVID-19 policies are intended to mitigate, not eliminate, risk. No single action or set of actions will completely eliminate the risk of SARS-CoV-2 transmission, but implementation of several coordinated interventions can greatly reduce that risk. For example, where physical distance cannot be maintained, students (over the age of 2 years) and staff can wear face coverings (when feasible). In the following sections, we review some general principles that policy makers should consider as they plan for the coming school year. For all of these, education for the entire school community regarding these measures should begin early, ideally at least several weeks before the start of the school year." But please tell me how having students in schools is denying science.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Thank you. I was thinking of a future Innistrad block where zombies have a counters theme to make them modular. The next card idea was Spare Parts - an enchantment similar to [[The Ozolith]], where tokens go from zombies that leave the battlefield to zombies entering the battlefield. The goal is to build a wave of super zombies as the stitchers build up a stockpile of useful parts.</TEXT>

    <DATE>2020-07-20 13:09:19</DATE>
    <TEXT>As anybody who follows EDH is aware, Jumpstart has brought in some fun new commanders supporting a variety of deck archetypes. However, none of those new cards are standard-legal, leaving many of us Arena players unable to experience them. A historic brawl queue would be the perfect way to showcase the new commanders (outside of an actual commander game mode, which Wizards seems to ignore on Arena). Think of how many more Jumpstart runs they could sell by promising that opening just one of every pack (a herculean feat, given the rarity system) would give you multiple powerful decks in the format.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I view it similar to playing in my EDH community. We all know what the best commander decks are, and if someone wants to come in and play [[Urza, Lord High Artificer]] against a table of [[Syr Gwyn, Hero of Ashvale]], [[Fblthp, the Lost]], and [[Ghired, Conclave Exile]], we politely ask that they choose another deck. I can't tell my opponent that I'm not looking to play vs Kinnan or Niv, so I give them the win they would have gotten anyway and move on with my life. It speeds both of our days up.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I think you just want to be salty, dude. 1) Urza is absolutely far and away more powerful than the commanders I listed. Just because he may "only" be in the top 25 most powerful commanders means nothing if taken in comparison to the competition. Maybe playing Archenemy could work, but even a weak cEDH deck warps a casual table around itself. I don't like that environment, so I don't play in it. 2) Having a reasonable chance to win is not the same as absolutely needing to always win. When I try to run a Snapdax mutate deck and get pummeled by a turn 3 [[Kogla, the Titan Ape]] or similar on the regular, I understand that I have no reasonable expectation of winning. Therefore, I concede rather than watch the same domination over and over.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Your right to free speech usually precludes actively trying to stop others from speaking. If, for example, every time person A tries to speak, person B blows an air horn until A stops talking, person B isn't respecting A's freedom of speech. You don't have to listen, you don't have to spread it, and you can absolutely put out a counter message. But actively silencing others, or physically stopping them from listening, is usually wrong.</TEXT>

The Sons of Liberty walked on board the ship, asked for the keys, then dumped the tea (the primary symbol of the Crown's unquestionable taxation authority in the Colonies) overboard. On their way out, they swept up the mess they had caused. Compare that to people burning down an Auto Zone and looting TVs. Not only is the destruction more serious and less directed, the motive seems to be the acquisition of goods illegally. A better comparison to what's happening now would be to the people of New York toppling a statue of King George III in 1776.</TEXT>

My personal favorites at the moment are: * \[\[Trostani, Discordant\]\] as a tokens/go-wide theme * \[\[Grumgully the Generous\]\] for a +1/+1 counter  amp; Proliferate theme * \[\[Kenreth the Returned\]\] as a 5-color shrines deck (though I could switch to \[\[Jengatha the Wellspring\]\] easily enough) * \[\[Snapdax, Apex of the Hunt\]\] is a Mardu-tate Mutations deck that hits like a truck * \[\[Illuna, Apex of Wishes\]\] does everything you would want in a big rampy mutate deck * \[\[Kaala, Zeneth Seeker\]\] for playing big, stompy, Timmy cards Here's a link to my Untapped Brawl profile where you can see decklists (ignore my bad win/loss ratios): [https://mtga.untapped.gg/profile/75a71733-ce28-4ad7-8380-51b453874b98/JASXQNUKMJGDNGPTVS53N4WAWQ?gameType=event amp;eventType=brawl](https://mtga.untapped.gg/profile/75a71733-ce28-4ad7-8380-51b453874b98/JASXQNUKMJGDNGPTVS53N4WAWQ?gameType=event amp;eventType=brawl)</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Christ was very complicated. This is the same person who not only willingly went with the soldiers who came to arrest him, he miraculously healed one who was struck by Peter (and admonished the latter). Christ seems to have only been violent when protecting the sacred from the profane. He would absolutely tear down the megachurches. However, he also stressed deference to government in terms of the material. He would never condone burning down buildings, especially those owned by people with no direct involvement with whatever the protest was about.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Thank you, Mr. Malthus. People have been saying that the end of natural resources is just a few years down the road for over 150 years now. According to famed Malthusian Paul Ehrlich, in "The Population Bomb" (1968), there should have been mass starvation (hundreds of millions dead) in the 70's (and, in later editions, 80's). Instead, people produce more food per square acre today than at any point in history. We actually use less farmland and have fewer farmers by far than in the 60's, but manage to feed a population almost twice as large. A similar thing happened with whale oil. For decades, whale oil was THE hot fuel commodity alongside coal. Many whale species came to the brink of extinction due to the demand for the substance. Then, practically overnight, kerosene takes over and the whaling ships go broke. As one good becomes more expensive, competition enters the market to drive down costs, or consumers start to modify behaviors/processes to reduce their reliance on the expensive substance.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Out of politicians, I'm glad to see Niki Haley and Dan Crenshaw on the list. I'd love to see them run in 2024 as President/VP, respectively. Also glad to see the Covington kid get a speaking slot. The kids got jobbed by the press and are a visible symbol of how our media culture can turn against innocent people. I'm less enthused to see the Trump family spread out over several days. Should be First Lady and then combine his kids/kids' spouses into one slot.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Best case scenario says that a vaccine may be widely distributed by the end of next year. With the shock to the system the world just took, I can see many years of recovery needed to get back to where things were at the start of the year. Relatedly, I feel a Biden Administration will be used by progressives to push policies like the GND, which will lengthen and deepen the economic uncertainty of the times.</TEXT>

Sandmann underscored how the media has abandoned their watchman position in society in favor of advancing preferred narratives, even when those narratives run counter to facts. Glad that lady got the boot for being an anti-semite. Kinda expected this to be the slow night, and not surprised that it was.

    <TEXT>It's dangerous and needs to stop. Period. This is the logical endgame of "abolish the police". It isn't going to be a kumbayah moment of love and harmony, it's going to be two angry mobs going at each other in the streets. No police leads to armed vigilantes and, just like there's people going around the country to join in the riots (not protests) against the cops, you're going to have people doing the same for the other side. There's always going to be people who want to hurt/kill those on the opposite political side. By removing law enforcement, we tacitly acknowledge that violence is an acceptable solution to political problems. This is like dropping a bloody carcass into a school of sharks - the sickos come running to get their entertainment by smashing things, looting stores, burning down buildings, and even hurting/killing other people.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>1) This literally doesn't make any difference in this situation. Whether you defund all police or replace most with social workers, this is still violence in the streets and needs to be stopped. Some social workers aren't going to put an end to this. The Mayor has already signaled that he stands with Antifa, so I don't think he's going to do anything to stop their 3-month riot. At this point, I think the National Guard needs to be patrolling the streets. 2) Gonna doubt the "long history of coordinating with right-wing terrorists" there. From what I've seen, "coordinating" means that they only arrest the people who are breaking windows and causing violence (invariably on the left) while ignoring the people chanting (the right). Just because evil people (or just people you hate) can exercise their 1st Amendment doesn't give you special dispensation to violently riot for months on end.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Couple of notes: Counterspelling is very powerful. Putting a repeatable counterspell on a permanent is going to shut out games singlehandedly. You don't need to add flash to abilities - you actually need to specify when a player can't activate a given ability at instant speed. As mentioned by someone else, check out guides on color pie theory. Your Quicksilver, for example, has the abilities and flavor of a red card. Be careful mixing card titles and subtypes. Your Iron Man Suits count as Iron, Man, and Suits type artifacts. Thor is a God, an of, and a Thunder creature. For the former, just use Artifact - Equipment Suit if you want a suit sub theme (try to keep new types to a minimum and reuse existing ones). The latter could be titled Thor, God of Thunder and have the creature type God. I don't know if you want the named characters to be legendary or not. The way it's created, a player can have 3 Iron Mans (Men?) and a pair of Spider Mans on the field. It makes swckbuilding easier, but loses the unique feel of the characters.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Clinton used a private server to transmit TS information outside of the approved channels, deleted emails when they were subpoenaed, and possibly used this system in official communication with POTUS. Secretary of State is one of the most sensitive Cabinet positions next to SecDef. This kind of flagrant ignorance/incompetence/malice with TS information would have a 19 year old Private sentenced to a Dishonorable Discharge or even prison time in Leavenworth. FLOTUS doesn't appear to have transmitted TS or S info in the open (don't know about itinerary, but have seen it published in press before, so may just be sensitive). She hasn't run them on her private server, and hasn't deleted anything before a subpoena (nor repeatedly lying about doing any of those, unlike Clinton). She should have her emails scrubbed by security to see if she let anything classified out, be banned from discussing official WH matters on private email, go through network security training, and put on warning.</TEXT>

I grew disenchanted with the environmentalists as it seemed more of a front to push Marxism and the constant drumbeat of apocalyptic thinking.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Not fans of them, as I find their views Biblically suspect. However, I don't see them as central figures in the same way that apocalyptic preachers are in climatology. For the record, I do believe in man-made climate change and that we should transition to cleaner fuels than petroleum. However, I also have more faith in geoengineering to mitigate issues and adapt to the changing climate. I also have seen solar and wind power go from good additions to more reliable clean sources like hydro and nuclear to being the only solutions allowed.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>He's a Death Knight from Krynn (Dragonlance). Much like Strahd is D amp;D's iconic vampire, Strahd is the iconic Death Knight. In life, he killed his wife and son to be with his lover. Later, after marrying her, he was ironically tricked into thinking she was unfaithful and killed her and their child. Cursed with undeath, he was a Darklord in Ravenloft for a time, but grew remorseful of the evils he had done both alive and dead. After he submitted to the punishment of his Domain, the Dark Powers let him go home. Whether because he learned his lesson or because he wasn't tormenting others in his power we don't know.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Depends on how psychological you want to be. I always took it that the worst hells are those we craft for ourselves. In my view, Strahd could end his torment at once, but he's so obsessed with nurturing envy and wrath that he's spiritually and emotionally incapable of even taking the first step of recognizing he has a problem. EVERYTHING else is to blame for how miserable Strahd is. He KNOWS Sergei tricked/stole his love, and is incapable of seeing how his bitter heart drove her away.</TEXT>

The idea that you are given rights by government programs, as in healthcare, flies in the face of classical liberalism. In a state of nature without any other humans around, every single one of your rights is either existant or unnecessary (as you pointed out, rights involving trials aren't a thing outside a legal system, but that just means people don't need them to remain free from unjust prosecution). In a state of nature with no other humans, there is no right to shelter, food, clothing, medicine, internet access, or the myriad other things that are "rights" in name only. Only the government can force others to give you these things against their will.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>That's for reprints, like the temples, where the same rare or mythic appears in multiple Arena sets. It keeps you from opening an M21 Fabled Passage when you already have 4 copies from Throne of Eldraine. What this doesn't protect you from is opening your 5th+ copy of a rare or mythic from within the same set. So the OP might already have 4x Nylea's Intervention, but nothing is keeping the system from giving out another copy of that card (in the form of 20 gems) any time they roll a rare ICR.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>1) There's also no reason to assume we're not an apex species elsewhere. In the off chance that we do discover microbial life elsewhere, it just proves that microbes can exist outside Earth. Maybe more complex species exist, but that's still conjecture, and would no more terminate the idea that humanity is apex than anything else we already know about. 2) The idea that humanity has primacy on Earth would, again, not really be shaken even in the event of contact with other sapient life. The Bible has much to say of God's primacy in the universe, and of humanity's on Earth, but nothing really precludes sapient life having primacy on other worlds except under the most literal readings.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>It...kinda does deny your example literally in Genesis 1. However, if by "some creator" you mean God and for whatever reason He used whale dung for the firmament, sure, the Bible has little to say of the exact origin of the firmament. Still, I don't think that proof of a miraculous creation of Earth by an omnipotent creator would be quite the blow to the faithful that you imagine it. Ultimately, microbial life on Venus will spark some academic debates in theology circles, but don't expect the vast majority of Christians (or vast majorities of any group) to take it as anything more than a few days of headlines. It just doesn't impact most people's lives or faiths that fundamentally.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Jesus being proven to have been homosexual would actually be a bigger shock to most Christian sects than ETs landing a spaceship in the Rose Garden, honestly. The Bible appears to explicitly condemn the former (though this point is debated, with some sects like the Presbyterians believing these passages don't refer to normal homosexual acts while others, like the Catholic Church, believing that homosexual acts are sinful mostly because they definitionally occur outside the sacrament of marriage), while not saying much about other lifeforms. From the Vatican Observatory FAQ: "Fr. Ernan McMullin, a philosophy professor at #160;Notre Dame with a background in physics, has discussed the possible impact on #160;Christian theology of discovering extraterrestrials, and he concludes only that #160;it would certainly inspire theologians to develop new #160;ways of thinking about #160;topics like original sin, the immortality of the soul, and the meaning of #160;Christ #8217;s redemptive act. But, as he #160;points out, there is already a voluminous #160;literature, and hardly a consensus, on these points among theologians even #160;today, without #160;ETs! Giuseppe Tanzella-Nitti, an astronomer and Opus #160;Dei priest who teaches theology at the Pontifical University of the Holy Cross #160;in Rome, comes to the same conclusion. He has written a lengthy entry on #160;Extraterrestrial Life in the #160;Dizionario Interdisciplinare di #160;Scienza e Fede #160;(The Interdisciplinary Dictionary of #160;Science and Faith, of which he was an editor). But at the end, he #160;concludes by saying #160;(in my translation of his Italian),  #8220;the last word on the #160;question of extraterrestrial life will not come from theology, but science. The #160;existence of intelligent life on planets other than the Earth neither rules in, #160;nor rules out, any theological principle. Theologians, like #160;the rest of the #160;human race, will just have to wait and see. #8221;" http://www.vaticanobservatory.va/content/specolavaticana/en/science--religion--society/faq-science-religion.html</TEXT>
