    <TEXT>I am filling out the pre-engineering form right now. I have to answer yes or no to whether I will participate in the corps of cadets. Will this be final on this form? What exactly do they do, what do you have to do if you are a member? Can I live off campus as a member (I am a transfer from NOVA)? Do you have to be in the military or something?</TEXT>

    <TEXT>My roommate and I are both transferring to VT from Nova, and since the decision deadline was June 1st, I guess we sort of assumed we had time to find a place. We were very wrong, and it looks like everything is full. Does anyone have any advice, or know of any secret methods we can use to find a 2 bed 2 bath (preferably), or anything?</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I #8217;m moving there this Fall, going to transfer to Virginia Tech. Its kind of difficult to find out for sure on Google. I see that there is definitely no FSSP or SSPX nearby, but does anyone know where the nearest TLM is? Alternatively, is there a Byzantine Catholic church within an hour of the school?

    <TEXT>what is this muscle on the side of my neck and why is it only on the left side? is that normal? my left neck has this extra tube muscle. Im wondering what its called. it #8217;s similar to the two tube muscle things that go up from the front of your neck. here is what Im talking about  gt; https://ibb.co/album/S5JNpC I dont know how to put the pics in order so I have them labeled left and right. all images I am equaly flexing/sucking in my neck, in the same lighting. any angle I do it at I cannot feel the same muscle on the right side of my neck, just a very small soft thing about the thickness of a piece of yarn. as you can see on the left side it looks like a fully developed muscle that goes up to the back of my ear. Why is it only on one side? I am wondering how I can train that muscle on the right side (unless it #8217;s supposed to be only on one side)</TEXT>

    <TITLE>I was not told my apartment would be a  #8220;smart home #8221;. Is there a way to disable these things? Or anything else I can do?</TITLE>

    <TEXT>I reserved the apartment and started the lease 2 months ago but was only able to move in a few days ago because of COVID and location. When I get here I find out that that instead of a key I have a stupid keypad thing that talks and makes dumb noises. I just want a key, why in the world did this have to be invented? Keys work fine. There is also a digital thermostat with a tablet thing underneath it that I guess is supposed to be high tech but is really just stupid. You can control the thermostat either by using the thermostat, or you can control it by using the unnecessary touch screen device right next to it. It #8217;s taking up space and I don #8217;t like how it looks. Oh and it doesn #8217;t even work, the apartment has been 84 degrees for the past few days. Also before signing the lease I asked (looking on google maps) if my balcony would be facing out towards the field and was told yes, and when I get here I find out no, it #8217;s facing the opposite direction, toward the other apartment buildings. This is very frustrating but I #8217;m not sure what to do about this. Is there a way to uninstall this unwanted unneeded smart thermostat stuff without destroying anything, and while being able to still have a thermostat?</TEXT>

    <TITLE>Working more than ever but suddenly I #8217;m failing. I don #8217;t know what to do</TITLE>
    <DATE>2020-09-29 04:55:41</DATE>
    <TEXT>I #8217;m in my 3rd year of college. The first 2 years were challenging but I worked hard 8-12 hours a day Monday - Friday and I managed to keep a 4.0 through the entire first two years. That was at community college. Now I #8217;ve transferred to a university and it #8217;s my first semester of my 3rd year. I don #8217;t know what #8217;s happening to me. This semester I work way harder than I ever did at CC. I only work, it #8217;s the only thing I have time for because of the ridiculous amount of homework, reading, quizzes, labs, recitations, and pre-recorded lectures/slides on top of the live lectures/slides and studying for tests. Since the start of this semester I have only left my desk to sleep 3-7 hours, eat 2-3 times a day, and go to the bathroom a few times. The first few weeks I would also go to the gym 3 times a week for about 1.5 hours, but I stopped for time reasons. Other than I am only doing homework. This is not an exaggeration. In all honesty, seriously, literally, I am doing schoolwork an absolute minimum of 12 hours per day and more often it is closer to 16 hours. This is 7 days per week, I have not relaxed for one weekend yet so far. I am constantly working, reading, studying, because if I don #8217;t, then I won #8217;t have all my homework submitted in time and I #8217;ll fail. I started with 15 credits (what I have always taken) but I dropped a class a couple weeks ago due to this and now I #8217;m taking 12. Still even with this I #8217;m constantly working, I #8217;m just submitting fewer late assignments. I failed my first physics test, and I missed a physics quiz, and I missed 3 chemistry homework #8217;s earlier in the semester. And now just tonight I didn #8217;t finish my physics lab on time and got a 0. I also found out tonight that I failed my recent chemistry test. So far all of the tests of this semester I have failed. I #8217;m really worried and I don #8217;t know what to do, I don #8217;t know how or why this is happening. I have always been a great student. I have to do homework all of the time that I #8217;m awake or else I #8217;ll fail at least one of the assignments for not finishing it on time, so I don #8217;t have time to go to a tutor. I am so behind in the material for all my classes because I #8217;m doing homework during the lecture, because if I don #8217;t then I won #8217;t have time to get to the other homework and one of them will not be finished by midnight on the due date. I spent days studying for both of those tests, I keep everything I have to do organized in a planner. I never procrastinate and I do my homework in the order that it is assigned. I thought I did well on the Chem test but I got a 45/100. There are only 3 tests and they are 60% of the grade. The tests are all multiple choice and according to the teachers email apparently on average the class did very well. What could be happening to me? If I fail these classes this far into my degree I don #8217;t see how my life won #8217;t be ruined. I don #8217;t know what do</TEXT>

I really don #8217;t have time to even learn the material because my priority has become submitting all of the assignments on time, because that will directly effect my grades.

My friend from the same CC as me also transferred with me and he is having the same problem, but I don #8217;t know if it #8217;s as bad as mine. Despite this I #8217;m still seeing the teacher say in an email that most of the class did well on the test</TEXT>
