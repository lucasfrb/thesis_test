Not good but a little better. These past 3 months have been horrible. Like I #8217;ve been depressed for something like 4 years but these past months have been something new. Just pure misery all the time.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Everyone had problems and sometimes they try to use them to relate but it comes of bad. And sometimes they just can #8217;t help and they just use you to get help themselves. Please don #8217;t kill yourself. I know shit looks dark and you don #8217;t see any light. But what if it changes the day after you killed yourself. I might not be sure but what if. I know how hard it is to live when everyday you wake up you feel like you just want to be dead. I feel it too. But let #8217;s try to keep going the both of us. I believe your life can become better. But I can #8217;t say that it will. But what do you have to lose if you keep going a while longer.</TEXT>
