    <DATE>2016-01-06 11:01:20</DATE>
    <TEXT> gt;**What will you be doing with this PC? Be as specific as possible, and include specific games or programs you will be using.** The usual general gaming, specifically play WoW (Which I have been told is mostly dependent on CPU?) and would like to eventually do some video editing at some point in the future  gt;**What is your maximum budget before rebates/shipping/taxes?** Looking for around $1000 AUD ($700USD) but willing to go as high as $1250AUD ($875USD) if you think it will benefit my needs enough.  gt;**When do you plan on building/buying the PC? Note: beyond a week or two from today means any build you receive will be out of date when you want to buy.** Not sure, could be within a few days or a few weeks, depends on how good it is.  gt;**What, exactly, do you need included in the budget? (Tower/OS/monitor/keyboard/mouse/etc)** everything except monitor, mouse and keyboard  gt;**Which country (and state/province) will you be purchasing the parts in? If you're in US, do you have access to a Microcenter location?** Victoria, Australia  gt;**If reusing any parts (including monitor(s)/keyboard/mouse/etc), what parts will you be reusing? Brands and models are appreciated.** benq monitor and standard mouse/keyboard  gt;**Will you be overclocking? If yes, are you interested in overclocking right away, or down the line? CPU and/or GPU?** Nope  gt;**Are there any specific features or items you want/need in the build? (ex: SSD, large amount of storage or a RAID setup, CUDA or OpenCL support, etc)** SSD would be nice but not sure yet if it will be worth my money.  gt;**Do you have any specific case preferences (Size like ITX/microATX/mid-tower/full-tower, styles, colors, window or not, LED lighting, etc), or a particular color theme preference for the components?** couldn't care, whatever is cheapest.  gt;**Do you need a copy of Windows included in the budget? If you do need one included, do you have a preference?** windows 8 or 10  gt;**Extra info or particulars:** I currently have a laptop that I am looking to upgrade from and would love it if you could provide some insight as to how much of an upgrade the build you are proposing would be over my laptop. laptop has the following: -i5 4210U -8gb ram -2gb intel HD family graphics Thanks for your time!</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Thanks a ton for the build and comparison! It looks pretty much just what I was looking for and its nice to have the general idea of performance in WoW aswell. Just had two questions, first off, what graphic settings where those framerates based off of? and also I have heard that 16gb ram can be overkill, rather not spend the money if I don't have to. Is the 16gb a reccomendation based on budget or based on what I am going to be using the computer for? Thanks again for the build!</TEXT>

    <TEXT>So I was doing a random daily heroic dungeon for valor and garrison resources and get put into an UBRS group. Notably among the group were a fresh shadow priest and a decently geared warrior tank. The second we get into the dungeon the priest kindly asks "Does anyone mind if we do leeroy?" (not an exact quote, but it was definitely said in a nice way). I along with what I thought was all the group agree as it doesn't take long to do and followers are annoying to get at first. Fast forward to the first the jump down to the third boss and we notice we missed a pack in the previous room, the tank jumps down anyway and we are forced to follow him. We bring it up and he links HIS Leeroy follower multiple times and continues. We of course call him out on it, fair enough to not want to the achievement but he was being quite rude. He starts to say things like "Don't do it in the first daily heroic" and the usual "u mad?" followed by more leeroy linking and saying he doesn't care hes just here for valor. We get to the final boss, and as the add phase is in progress a "would you like to kick ____" vote box comes up. I quickly double check who it is, sure enough its the tank, so he gets kicked and we finish off the boss, and he gets none of his precious valor. TLDR: Tank was being a dick, got him kicked DURING the last boss of UBRS so he missed out on the valor.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Fair enough, cant remember exactly everything he said but the takeaway is yes, he was making me mad, I already had the follower so didn't really care about that but I can tell you that he definitely deserved it.</TEXT>

Im assuming a case with very good air filters will help me out in this situation but without any past experience with building computers I don't know where to start looking other then one by one on retailers websites. I don't want to spend any more then $125 AUD on a case and it would be amazing to spend less then $100 but i am not sure how feasible that is. As far as color or style goes i am not too fussy, if it is going to help keep hair out of my computer i am happy. If you have any experience with this or know of any cases that fit my needs please let me know!</TEXT>

    <TITLE>~$1300 AUD WoW Legion PC</TITLE>
    <DATE>2016-07-21 08:36:53</DATE>
    <TEXT> gt;**What will you be doing with this PC? Be as specific as possible, and include specific games or programs you will be using.** Gaming, specifically World of Warcraft Legion and even more specifically 20man raids.  gt;**What is your maximum budget before rebates/shipping/taxes?** around the $1300 dollar ballpark but more like  lt;$900 AUD for everything except the graphics card.  gt;**When do you plan on building/buying the PC? Note: beyond a week or two from today means any build you receive will be out of date when you want to buy.** Tomorrow, everything except the GPU which I will be buying at a later date.  gt;**What, exactly, do you need included in the budget? (Tower/OS/monitor/keyboard/mouse/etc\)** Tower, minus the graphics card.  gt;**Which country (and state/province) will you be purchasing the parts in? If you're in US, do you have access to a Microcenter location?** Victoria, Australia  gt;**If reusing any parts (including monitor(s)/keyboard/mouse/etc), what parts will you be reusing? Brands and models are appreciated.** Will be purchasing an aftermarket rx480 or gtx1060 within a month. Standard razer keyboard, steelseries mouse and a 24.5" 1080p 60Hz monitor.  gt;**Will you be overclocking? If yes, are you interested in overclocking right away, or down the line? CPU and/or GPU?** Slightly interested in overclocking down the line, but I dont think its in my budget at the moment so, no.  gt;**Are there any specific features or items you want/need in the build? (ex: SSD, large amount of storage or a RAID setup, CUDA or OpenCL support, etc)** a SSD would be great, 128gb is all I need though.  gt;**Do you have any specific case preferences (Size like ITX/microATX/mid-tower/full-tower, styles, colors, window or not, LED lighting, etc), or a particular color theme preference for the components?** Mid tower.  gt;**Do you need a copy of Windows included in the budget? If you do need one included, do you have a preference?** Nope, I can get a free copy of windows 10 (student? or education? cant remember exactly, is this version going to be ok?)  gt;**Extra info or particulars:** I am going to purchase a gtx1060 or rx480 in roughly a months time just before actual legion launch date, so although my total budget is around the $1300 AUD mark I am looking for a build without a gpu for ~$900, preferably less. Depends on what the prices are like then which card I get. I also have a cat and a dog that shed an insane amount, so a case with good filters on any intake fans is an absolute must, other then that i am not too fussed about general appearance of my PC, just how well it runs. Last but not least i'd love to save on shipping, so depending on how hard it is to figure out, $10-$20 priority on parts that I can pick up tomorrow from PC shops around Melbourne. Thanks for your time putting a build together for me, and feel free to ask me if you need any more information/clarification</TEXT>

All parts are going to be purchased from MSY, which for some reason is not listed on pcpartpicker as a retailer. Have checked each individual price against pcpartpicker, and MSY is cheaper then all of them apart from the RAM which isn't worth me driving to a different store for just ~$5. Planning on buying all the listed parts tomorrow and would like the thumbs up from someone experienced with building computers before I make the plunge. Also, I can get windows 10 "Education" through my university for free, is this version of windows going to work for me? are there any major downsides to it? Thanks for your time looking over my build, I really appreciate it :D</TEXT>

As far as PSU's go the listed PSU was really my best guess, should I be looking for something like gold rating or more watts? Thanks again</TEXT>

I am going to be purchasing an AiB 1060 or 480 in the coming weeks when stock stabilizes and all the option are out. This is my first build so I'm just looking for the OK from some experienced builders/people who know what they are talking about. I noticed the motherboard said it only supports upto 2133MHz RAM, is this something I should be worried about or is it standard and the performance effect minimal? Last but not least i'm happy with the case but still not 100% sold on it, if you have any experience with a case that is less than $100 AUD and has removable air filters on all intakes most importantly, and 2 fans, let me know. I was very excited by the Antec P280 MSY had on clearance for $90 but unfortunately the last one sold. Thanks a ton for your time</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Basically if those green swirls you see arnt soaked they destroy the platform and deal large raid wide damage, likely killing multiple people or straight up wiping the raid. Luckily for me they drop in a slightly staggered sweeping fashion across the platform, allowing me to soak one and then blink into a second saving the raid. According to my death log there was .35 seconds between the first meteor landing and the second.</TEXT>

    <TITLE>Extremely rough/messy bottom layer</TITLE>
    <DATE>2018-01-19 16:57:24</DATE>
    <TEXT>I recently got a cr-10 and after some tweaking/testing am mostly happy with the print quality. However the bottom layer of my prints is in my opinion beyond bad. I am printing with a raft for most things right now until my pei sheet arrives. I have done some smaller prints without a raft and it is smoother but still quite messy/full of gaps and clear lines. The rest of the print is fine, except the top surface which is MUCH better but still not where I want It to be. I #8217;m using an Australian brand pla+ filament https://imgur.com/a/PJCIv</TEXT>

    <TITLE>Ideas for who to get to review my SoP?</TITLE>
    <DATE>2020-10-13 07:49:30</DATE>
    <TEXT>I #8217;m applying for some aerospace engineering masters programs at American universities, however I got my bachelors in Australia and currently reside here. This also means that my LoR writers are Australian, and don #8217;t have much/any experience with the American graduate admissions process. I am working with them to write good LoRs, providing resources and samples ect, but I #8217;m especially concerned with getting feedback on my SoP. They will likely be able to provide generic feedback, but obviously they lack the experience of the do #8217;s and do not #8217;s. Has anyone got any recommendations on where I can look to get solid feedback?</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I believe it #8217;s B. For them to be equal, x and y would have to be along the same line, and the diagram clearly shows they are not, and if they were, that would necessarily be represented by a different diagram.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>It does state though that while diagrams aren #8217;t necessarily to scale, relative position can still be assumed from diagrams, and the diagram pretty clearly shows that the line x isn #8217;t continuous with the line y. Another way of looking at it is that there is definitely a line segment horizontally connecting the vertical lines of x and y, so they are not continuous.</TEXT>
