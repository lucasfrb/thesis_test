    <TEXT>Odette's 1st, 2nd, passive skills is so useless (only good at clearing lanes but other mages can do it far better) and her ulti has nice damage and has nice damage reduction but it is very easy to cancel it, just cc her and the ulti will be cancel and she has no escape skill like other meta mages, for mages i recommend kagura, kadita, harley (these mages can kill and out all the times bc of their skills, lylia is nice too) also gussion is one of the mages (asassin mage) if only you can master him</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Super slow and also not that smart.. You're taking too much time to decide on diving or not.. If you're too slow then the enemy hero's skills might be already available and might escape or kill you, and enemies can dodge your skills if you're too slow, idk why your enemies is so bad.. but while you're playing gusion, you will also need fast combos and fast hands so that your enemies can't even react while you're killing them in seconds, But nice work on that last kill, you waited for your skills to cooldown before diving but your combo is pathetic, BTW im a gusion main, 600+ matches, 63.5% winrate, ID: 191203131 (sorry for bad english)</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Im sorry bro, but in the future your low stars operators will not be able to keep up with the enemies. And if you need cheap operators to fend off early enemies you can just use vanguard, fast snipers (bp, exu) or just use myrtle to collect deployment points, so the low stars having low cost is not a big deal. Idk why people are saying that its about your strategy and not about your operator but in reality, they are just watching guides on youtube to complete a stage. But there are some strong 4 star operators like myrtle, coura</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Her drones are useless? Her drones is the best thing about her bro. Her 1st skill's slow is very good, if you combine it with manticore the enemies will barely move (i use it at cc area 59 to reach risk 14). And her 2nd skill's damage (active) is on par with astesia with 2nd skill and maybe it's much better because astesia can only hit 2 enemies while her drones (active skill) can hit all enemies, so you can put that drone on front of your defender or you can use it to assassinate someone (her drones cannot be targeted for first seconds of deployment, so she is good on assassination). Her 3rd skill is also good, it's like 3 mini meteorites, you can use it when the stage restricts you to bring less operators, it can also replace your snipers if you dont have any good snipers. She has many roles so i recommend investing on her.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Is there a chance that there is gonna be a cross save between ps4 and android in the future? For me, it is easier to play in ps4 and i already got mona and good 4 stars there(no reroll) while i got 0 5star on the android and i already rerolled for 2 days but i want to play on the android so i can play the game everywhere</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Me and my friends are gonna play coop once they reach AR 16. Should i show off my 2 5 star? (venti and mona) or should i just use my fave 4 star? The 2 of them are playing on ps4 and the other is on pc so i assume that that they don't reroll for 5 star except for the pc player (im also playing on ps4 with no rerolls). Im just asking because i think that if they saw my 5 stars they will feel kinda unlucky and quit the game because of it or should i just not assume that my way of thinking is also same as theirs? I really want to have friends to play with so im kinda careful here</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Where should i play? Android (huawei nova 5t) or ps4? On my ps4 i already have mona plus good 4 stars (AR23, 0 gacha currencies, america server) while on the android I only have keqing, razor, Fischl plus free 4 stars (AR12, still has a lot of gacha currencies, Asia server) and i can use my ps4 controller for android. Also my friends are also playing in the asia server. So where should i play? And why? (if you will answer pc then i dont have a pc, i only have a laptop with i3 8th gen, i haven't try it with games because i usually use it on studying/online class and i usually play on ps4 but i think it is not good enough)</TEXT>

    <TEXT>How does the pity system work? I already did 50 rolls without a 5 star on ventis banner, does that mean that my next 40(?) rolls the next banner will guarantee a 5 star? Or will it reset? If it resets then it is really hard to get a 5 star</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Is my team and combos okay? Keqing, Xingqiu, Chongyun, Barbara and my combo is Xingqiu/Barbara will use elemental skills to apply wet to the enemies, then switch to Chongyun, then use his elemental skill, after that the enemies in the area should be freeze then switch to Keqing to use her elemental burst (super conduct) then normal attacks (the normal attacks will also freeze the enemies because of Barbara's elemental skill and i think Xingqiu's skill will also apply wet? And Keqing's Normal attack will have a cryo effect because of Chongyun skill) after some basic attack then Keqing elemental skill to apply super conduct effect. Is it okay or should i change something? And what 5 star should i save and roll for and what 5 star is a perfect partner for Keqing?</TEXT>
