    <TEXT>The thing you need to realise about Radiohead is they're (the music is) talking about everything. Every little detail of everything. As soon as you fall in the trap of oh they're talking about this political thing that happened, or oh they're parodying the way music is or was, then you've lost the ball. When i first read this i thought to myself, yeah there's some truth here but it's not the whole story, but then i realised the bigger picture again and remembered that everyone was like that back then. Not just rockstars. Everyone was trying too hard to be something they're not, something too obvious and too mainstreamy. It's a lot to take in but i don't even think radiohead themselves can take it in. They just get together and let the flow happen through them. We'd have to be superior beings to truly understand a Radiohead album as a whole.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>It amazes me the excuses people will weave to get round the fact that the Pro is nothing but a money making scam. Microsoft proved to everyone in the PS3/360 generation that people would accept pretty much anything, what with the 360's red ringing and people just accepting they'd have to buy a new one because MS simply told everyone they don't care and there's no free repairs, and then the elite consoles and stuff. Because of shit like that Sony knew they could double their money easily. Make an underpowered console and release a better one later... Its also obvious that all these companies work together anyway. What are the chances that both systems would be pretty much exactly the same for the past 2 generations? You can't say oh it's because both companies have to stay on a level because third parties will release the same games on both consoles. What would be the point of talking about specs then? They obviously have to communicate with each other through the development process to make sure the other isn't going to be too much better. It wouldn't surprise me if it goes further than that though. Why must there be a standard of talking about this stuff that conforms to what these companies want. They want money and if they could brainwash you into buying a cardboard box for the same price and pictures of games, they *would* do it. The only reason they have a kind of respectable attitude these days is because they're slowly learning that (and so is the customer unfortunately) that people talking on the internet has given us power over them. So they actually make more money when they stop being dicks. Even if they are still dicks inside lol. I wish people would just see things the way they are and tell it like it is. /rant over</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I watched it years ago. I must admit even though i'm a big fan of Icke it does make some good points. Like the way he references a book that Hitler used to have by his bed side. Another few things like that, that definitely make you wonder. A lot of it was typical anti icke stuff aswell. The guy who made it is a christian and refers to that religion and the bible a lot which is another minus really. All in all i recommend people watch it whatever side you're on though. Icke is cool and all but it would be dangerous to treat him or anyone like they're untouchable.

    <TEXT>NECS clients of our food distribution ERP software have been reporting data on their reports and dashboards, which do not appear to be accurate. This causes NECS technical support to spend a large amount of time and resources helping clients determine if there is a problem such as a software bug, corrupted data, etc. However when the data is manually audited, including analyzing the SQL data tables, hardcopy invoices, etc., the data on reports and dashboards are proven to be accurate and correct. It becomes only the clients memory of what the figures should be as the cause of the problem. These types of issues causes wasted time for both NECS technical support staff and our clients. In fact as much as 20% of our technical support resources are used to deal with these issues, so our bottom line is affected. NECS, Inc. believes that we are the first technology company to come out and express what may be happening. It is related to quantum physics and a phenomena that has been named  #8220;The Mandela Effect #8221;. The purpose of this video is to explain what has been occurring utilizing the names / item descriptions of commonly known foodservice inventory. This will be more easily explained than using specific customer data, which would not be known by other NECS clients, or anyone else watching this video.

    <TEXT>What's your idea of things NOT being hopeless though? Bernie Sanders being elected? Trump getting another two terms? We're trying to overthrow that power structure. No matter what happens things will probably have to get worse before they get better. The real problem in my opinion is people just don't understand how weird things really are. Consider all the paranormal stuff, plus the advances in quantum mechanics etc. We're dealing with a power at the top who take all that for granted and are probably the one's trickling it out to us. Politics and censorship aren't the problem, they're a road block on the path to the problem.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>True. But let's face it the right are less insane than the left. Yes they're both basically the same and both walking into the same trap but i'd much rather have to preach the truth to a right winger than a left. I've known lefty types through my life, lefty types like we see now, far and even the more centred. They are the most ignorant careless fucks on the planet. I'd love to have been able to stay completely non partial in this political bullshit but I can't stand these people who identify as leftists in these times. With them taken down to their usual peg we just need to convert the right to gain numbers. If the left win this, Conspiracy and true non conformity will seem like a fairytale within a decade. You know this is true. I want people to see Trump is as bad as Hilary or any of them and all that but you just can't deny the stubborn ignorance of the left. You think the left even have a 4chan? Anyway sorry to go on such a rant but seriously..</TEXT>

    <TEXT>And he argued the tired old idea that "You can't have a conspiracy that involves so many people because someone would speak out." I can't remember the time stamp I think it was about half an hour in, he starts saying that even though he was an insider he couldn't find anything about aliens or ufo's, and used that to basically say conspiracies aren't real. He said something like "We all want conspiracies to be real because we want everything to make sense, right?" Why the fuck would you say something like that? I mean what makes him think that in his position he would have some special clearance to info like that? He honestly thinks that's about as high as this shit goes. There's no fucking way this man has ever read a book on conspiracy, let alone watched anything about it at length. It's so fucking annoying that there's still people on that 2009 level in 2019 going on 2020. What the fuck do you do?</TEXT>

That's only a self sealing argument if the debate stops there and neither party has ever thought further about their opinion on it.. Not to mention the presumptious 9/11 inside job is a hoax bullshit... Fucking hell.. It just gets worse. I don;t know how they pass this off as critical thinking.

    <TEXT>I've always been less optimistic than the average person when it comes to a mass awakening. I just know what people are like, their whole being is a facade. Completely controlled by what makes them uncomfortable and without any real mentally challenging experiences in their lives it's like they're in a perpetual state of mental puberty. The desire to fit in outweighs everything. Even people like David Icke and these enlightened people you see like Eckhart Tolle have had life too easy and been spiritually guided throughout their lives. They're enlightenment was handed to them on a plate, with instructions. I remember being about 10 years old and seeing a politician on the tv standing at a pedestal talking some crap and just knowing how obvious it was that the shit he was reading off obviously came from higher up, some power or other that really controls things. My first thought was that everyone must know this and just doesn't care because life is too short and depressing so we just ignore it and take the piss. I think an awakening could happen but awakening will need to be on trend somehow, and it does look like things are going that way. It depends what day it is though sometimes I think it must happen sometimes I'm not so sure. Especially on days where everyone is shouting about left/right politics and when i consider how the right wing actually started accepting a lot of the truth in the past 10 years but they just won't go past the political side of it. Even though sometimes they seem to be into the deeper stuff (GLP) they still think it's all about getting someone from the elite to take down the elite, and the "Deep state" which is basically just normiespeak for illuminati, and it just gives the whole thing a feel of mundanity. We know these people are way beyond us in every way. Anything "paranormal" you think is true or have experienced they know all about. Look at how they even control the narrative of mainstream science. It should be impossible but they do. If i thought there was no awakening coming for a fact i'd just let it all go to be honest and just confide in the fact that at least we've climbed out enough to know there's an afterlife, even if we're not sure exactly what that's going to be like. General consensus seems to be fucking losing everything and reincarnating forever and shit. [Maybe there's hope though](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mMYhgTgE6MU).</TEXT>

Bill Maloney, Ian Puddick, Chris Fay, Jon Wedger  amp; Andrew Ash were setting me up with FALSE INFORMATION. Why would they need to make me think Icke was a paedophile ?, and WHY when i told David about this, did he pass me onto Richie Allen, who then after speaking with me had IAN PUDDICK on his show, and carried on like his best friend. Also why has David Icke NOT said anything about what Bill was trying to do to him, or was David in this, and knew what was going on ?? Then Icke talks to Shaun Attwood, and Attwood then talks to Jon Wedger, and no . one wants to ANSWER MY QUESTIONS. WHY ??????</TEXT>

    <TEXT>The continual political battle between Left  amp; Right, Liberal  amp; Conservative, Democrat  amp; Republican is manufactured. The powers that be use propaganda to fuel hatred and it's only purpose is to divide us and keep our focus on each other, instead of the things that truly matter. The media manipulates stories and facts in order to paint extreme caricatures of what each side is and because of this manipulation, people associate these exaggerations with real humans. People become dehumanized and it is easy to harass and physically attack people just for holding different opinions. A war amongst the peasants prevents a war amongst their rulers. It is standard divide and conquer and it's time we all move past it.</TEXT>
