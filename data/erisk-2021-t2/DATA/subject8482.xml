    <TITLE>Police escort every morning?</TITLE>
    <DATE>2014-04-14 20:11:02</DATE>
    <TEXT>If not every morning, then at least several times a week. Between 8:30 and 9am around 4/5 police cars speed up Whitworth street, presumably to Bloom street (Crown court?) With other officers blocking Princess street etc. Does anyone have any idea what this is all about? Is it a high profile court case that I have somehow missed completely?</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I installed several mods a while back and ended up messing things up and needed to do a clean install. However every time I do, Steam ever so helpfully recovers all my saved game files and presumably recovers the other files (ini or whatever) that is causing my constant CTD. How can I do a complete, fresh, clean deletion and install of Skyrim through Steam?</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Police everywhere. Pushing people back. People were filming with their cameras so I presumed it was a celebrity visit, then it clearly wasn't as they told everyone to disperse. No idea what was going on but it seemed to be centred on Boots as a couple of dozen police were keeping everyone away. Anyone know?</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Hi. Apologies for the clearly nooby question. I've been playing BOI:R on PS4 and Vita for a while now and recently picked up the Afterbirth+ bundle in the Steam sale. I've beaten Mom a couple of times and have still not seen Mom's heart. I thought that level unlocked the next time you played after beating Mom. Has it all changed? Have I messed my game up by installing a couple of cosmetic mods (color hud, item desc etc)? Or does it only unlock after beating Mom a few times now? Thanks in advance :)</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Hey all. I've had my PSVR for a while now and finally got around to buying a few 3d titles to try it. My son watched Lego Batman yesterday and it worked perfectly. Today I try it and for some unknown reason they're not playing at all (even Batman) and I'm getting the message "No 3D set up detected" (varies slightly depending which title I try). Nothing in the set up has noticeably changed and all software is up to date. Had anyone had this before and/or know a fix for it? Many thanks!</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I don't think English typically makes the distinction between masculine/feminine for blonde. From the Oxford dictionary;  gt;The alternative spellings blonde and blond correspond to the feminine and masculine forms in French, but in English the distinction is not always made, as English does not have such distinctions of grammatical gender. Thus, blond woman or blonde woman, blond man or blonde man are all used. The word is more commonly used of women, though, and in the noun the spelling is typically blonde. In American usage the usual spelling is blond for both adjective and noun</TEXT>

They rolled up in my town a few years ago and the police 'strongly advised' all pubs in the area to close one afternoon because there was a funeral for one of them.

Most of them also have crazy Irish accents even though they've never been there, it's bizarre.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I disagree completely. School uniforms are actually pretty beneficial in helping students feel less alienated. Poorer students or those that don't care about dressing "cool" don't need to worry about being victimised by their peers. Also, this kid had the new trousers but they were "too itchy", so it's not like they couldn't afford them. Sometimes in life you have to do stuff you don't really want to - wearing a proper school uniform can help kids prepare for that.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I know that, but fathead is widely known and the most famous bread substitute. Throwing garlic and cheese on top of it doesn't seem like it should be out of most people's imagination. Using cauliflower stalks as a potato substitute - as in this post - is actually something I haven't seen before.</TEXT>

    <TEXT> gt;Just because it's not right doesn't mean it's not accurate communication That's such a bizarre statement. The fact it's wrong and actually means the opposite of what you're trying to say *does* make it inaccurate communication. The phrase 'could care less' is predominantly an American issue. Say it to someone from elsewhere in the world and they'll be a bit confused. Resulting in inaccurate communication.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Is there any way to make companions (namely Parvati) temporarily leave my side so she doesn't get killed instantly? I am trying to clear the ape things near the ship at the start and they are pretty much one-shotting her. (this is on Supernova btw) Pressing Z just makes her walk some place then immediately run to my side when I walk outside/enter combat. I can't have her dying right at the start, she seems a super interesting character.</TEXT>
