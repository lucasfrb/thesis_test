    <TITLE>35M Nightmares and Nightsweats</TITLE>
    <DATE>2020-10-15 05:24:47</DATE>
    <TEXT>Hi! First time posting and thought I would give it a shot. 5'6" 150lbs Arab American living in the United States. Current prescription: 200mg Zoloft, 2mg Abilify. I have been suffering from nightmares and severe night sweats for approximately 1 year now. I am currently under a psychiatrists care and was/is prescribed my current medication for approximately 2 years now. I was diagnosed with depression 3 years ago and have been suffering since with slight improments due to medication. Lately I have been suffering from severe nightmares and nightsweats with a very erratic sleeping pattern and general fatigue. When I wake, my legs and chest are covered in sweat. My whole life I weighed ~125lbs but I currently weigh 150lbs due to lack of excersize and a change in dietary habbits. I have been eating out more due to lack of home prepared food and dating. I also noticed an increase in my sugar consumption. I have not consumed any alcohol for 3 years now and I occasionaly smoke cannabis (once every few months recreationally amoung friends, however I do not share). I am a smoker of cigarettes averaging ~5-7 cigaretts per day. One in the morning with coffee. One after dinner. One before sleep and a couple in between if so. I never had these symptoms before. I spoke with my dr. about it and he applied Abilify to my precription intake. Before my prescription/diagnosis, I did not experience anything like this in the history of my physical health. This is completely new. My general physician recommended I obviously quit smoking, (which I agree completely and I am taking the steps to begin quitting) resume excersize and change my diet along with proper water intake. My question is: I have not been able to pin point exactly why this started and what is causing it to continue? Thank you!</TEXT>

    <TEXT>All you shallow ab's women here on Reddit piss me off. All I have been getting are women trying to "charge" me for "hookups". What a bunch of bullshit. Fuck the fact that that shits illegal. That shit is amoral and shameful. Are you kidding me. I do not encourage prostitution. I encourage you to get educated and find a career. Anyone can work at pizza hut. It takes courage, skill, determination and motivation to become a nurse, a paralegal, a business manager, teacher etc. We need more women to be empowered. Not this pay for play bullshit. I fucking wish I had a pussy. As a single man it is hard enough to find sex, consistant sex as it is. I have to work hard as fuck to try and get laid. All you have to do is stand there and listen to our bullshit. If I had a pussy, I would fuck all the time. Fuck money. I get to enjoy my dick fully like maybe once a month if I am lucky. You can enjoy your pussy whenever you want. Seriously piss me off. Why do I always get the wacko fucks. Why can't I just find a normal chick who wants consistant sex. What...who hurt you in your past that made me the target of your scheme. Shameful. Do something with your life. Contribute to something. Ugh! Seriously piss me right the fuck off!</TEXT>
