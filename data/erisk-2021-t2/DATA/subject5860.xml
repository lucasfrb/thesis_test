    <TEXT>It's basically like being racist. The thing is you can insult people of different races, you just can't do so directly influencing something they have no control of. "Haha your ancestor used to be my slave" maybe insult them on things that are much lighter and acceptable? Specific to them? Like the decisions the make? Or how they take care of things? Or how they're late for work? If you have the question of where to draw the line. Think of the same joke you're about to make and see if you can use that joke on a person of other race, gender, etc</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I know what you mean but you are misunderstanding their scenario. The thing is you imagine the worst to be living in concentration camps in Germany or living in Russian gulags because of how horrible the conditions are in there. And you are not wrong. Because transgenders don't get physically beaten(at least in the first world countries) or they aren't treated as slaves. But here's the thing. Being ousted from the society is as worse as living in concentration camps. Now i don't know where you're from, but from where i come(which i wouldnt like to disclose), transgenders by law are allowed and even that law passed only very recently. But people literally move away a few inches when a trans person sits next to them in public transport, they get thrown out of restaurants, they can't find solid jobs and end up working as a prostitute, their families disown them the second they find out about them, they don't have any friends. And no they can't go to the cops because they don't have money and they would probably get kicked out of the police station if they tried. There is literally nothing anyone can do. Living a life like this is as worse as living in concentration camps</TEXT>

Going by your logic thoroughly of getting awestruck at the suicide rate percentages, i can bet mosttt of them are from these countries. Like i said, i would completely take back everything i said if there was a comprehensive research on this and someone actually found a brain disorder or some sort specifically in transgenders</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Alright let me actually spend some time responding to you. Now it is completely true that without CAA Muslims can file for citizenship which takes 5 years or more. And without CAA even non-muslims including Sikhs that live in Pakistan can do so. But that's not the point. The point of the Anti CAA protests is for leaving out an entire religion only just because of the differences between Hindus and muslims. Now, these differences should be set completely aside when you take a secular country like India whose intentions were to bring in as much diversity as we could considering the number of cultures, languages and religions that exist. Our forefathers build this country to maintain the harmony and acceptance among every religion. Bringing the point saying "that's why India split up into India and Pakistan to drive away muslims" is hence crazy. Yes. Muslims did leave. A majority of them. But not all. You cannot blame the muslims that chose to stay in india just because they did not join the gang that left. Another point I observe is many people, not just you, blatantly call every anti CAA supporter a leftist. Now, although leftism when the term was coined ALSO included topics such as anti-clericalism, it's main focus was on communism, anarchism, socialism and social democracy. So I do not understand how you just throw words like that at anti CAA protesters. And the next point is you bringing up "fear mongers". Again, this is not just you, I constantly come across this word by pro-CAA supporters. Now, you're right. These protests could be done in a very friendly no-violence manner and they can still get their point across to the central government to be inclusive of muslims. But, as you know, we do not live in an ideal world and people that partake in violence do partake and people that don't cannot be associated with them. If by spreading awareness, you mean fear monger, then I have no clue how else to speak my mind in this democratic society with free speech. Also, in retaliation I do find pro CAA violence in many states too.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Supporting him by being a good citizen and maintaining safety of oneself and his fellow citizens during a pandemic and parallely disagreeing with the chief leader, who I literally have the right to have an opinion if in a democratic country, is allowed. But again your two inch brain cells cannot comprehend that because I'm sure you completely supported every other leader you hate during a time like this. Besides I never said the move on this post is not to be accoladed. There's tonnnnnnnes of other reason I hate Modi and will continue to hate and spread hatred wherever I go and you have 0 reason to convince me not to. I'm sure you scream "Fuck you Kohli can't perform shit on world Cup finals" and at that time you should've told yourself "yOu FrEaK yOu CaNnOt hAtE yOuR tOp gUy dUrInG a TiMe lIkE tHiS"</TEXT>

It is about freaks who think caging animals and growing them in backyards for "education"(as quoted by Doc Antle) is totally normal and what the animal wants. They are so delusional and unaware of the perspective from the animal's side. It is meant to raise awareness not interpretation.

    <TEXT>Next are you going to ask me "then why trust ppl with cars? Cuz 1% of them cause accidents" cuz if you're I'll give reasons to both these questions. Now guns however you put is not equivalent to cars or alcohol. Guns are made for one purpose and nothing else, to destroy or to kill. No one's gonna buy guns to shove up their ass for pleasure. Cars on the other hand are essential. Alcohol, though is a long shot as it's not "essential" for anyone, it is still not used for driving. Like no one buys alcohol saying "I need to drive that's why I'm buying alcohol". You can do this analogy for anything in this manner. Medical drugs, sharp tools. Like they have purposes other than to just kill people. And to top all of these the most important reason you can't compare guns to these are things are safety. Guns are complex. There are a LOT of safety measures one needs to take when buying guns. Every idiot in town does not know them. Law abiding police officers undergoing years of training do know and they deserve to carry one for keeping people in their town safe.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I'm not intent on strawmanning. I am legitimately open for arguments. If poilce are "incompetent" they wouldn't go through years of academy training with gun control and safety training. An average man doesn't. Guns especially require a lot of safety and rules. Yes sometimes cops abuse gun power. But they are still cops and they can be punished. Their job is to provide safety. But I agree that fearing for a miniscule population should not stop everyone from getting guns. Maybe if the government provided such safety training and performing background checks, gun usage control before providing a license I can agree on them having guns.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Lmao that's a whole another debate but no dark humour does not mean misogynistic jokes. Even dark humour has no room for any racial/ misogynistic or anything that can hurt a specific set of people. Dark humour may include violence, gore or sexual jokes that again do not generalize any set of people that haven't done anything wrong and don't deserve to be mocked. Also there is no room for comparing the suffering of one group to another because it's relative and very dumb to do that. For instance, the blacks don't suffer as much as trangenders right now but like two hundred years ago that wouldn't have been the case.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Hmm although this does make sense, your initial comment on the comparison of cell phones being stupid is wrong. This tracking and monitoring are being performed by most of the cell phone comapnies and no cell phones don't just go off and stay off forever for anyone. We all need phones for a daily living, for work, for practically everything. And since companies like Google, Facebook have already been doing this tracking for years and these protestors still used them why be scared of digital certificates that aren't going to like insert microphone tracking or geolocation or camera tracking. They literally just track to see if you have the vaccine or not</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Pedophilia is something so specific. It's a kind of pervert sure but not all perverts are pedophiles. And no. Being perverted is not something to be proud of. Many men are perverts and there is a time and space to be a pervert in. It definitely is wrong to be a pervert in most places. Staring at boobs at Costco and pointing towards attractive girls very explicitly is what a pervert would do. Someone who knows to behave and although they too find such girls attractive don't make any environments uncomfortable, that guy is not a pervert.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Although you may be right to some extent, the blame should go to politicians too. Let me give you an example. Dutch people from Netherlands, Swedish people are very difficult when it comes to making them quarantine. Which is why the lockdowns were never implemented properly there and they still combated in these months. I know we can't compare our population with them but the government knows that too. Unlike other countries many Indians don't even have bathrooms in their and they use public restrooms. In such cases, the best way to quarantine individuals is by actually providing everything to their doors including at least two square meals and at least 100 rs a day for covering other expenses which is actually totally possible considering there are around just a 100 million lower class individuals that can't exactly "stock up food or not work for a month straight".living in big cities where the cases are the worst. When these are not provided they obviously turn desperate and they don't mind getting infected by a virus than to starve to death</TEXT>

    <TEXT>It's very easy to say "I knew all along" when in reality the 30 rock jokes were just limited to jokes and if someone said Weinstein actually did at that time you would get hit with millions of "yOu hAvE nO pRoOf". Which is the same today. There are so many false allegations that actual legitimate allegations get masked and hidden by these. We have progressed, I'm not gonna lie, when it comes to transparency in media. But people still remain skeptical to media.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Emotional intelligence, this term seems so important but also something I don't know how to be good at? For instance, even the ones that know how to make friends know there is a certain boundary when trying to speak to people. They don't let down their guard too much and so don't try to look too "desperate" for connection. Maybe this problem is a little hard to understand and it's just something personal for me but I find it hard in seeking that.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Now let's analyse the "joke" you made right. Point A, there are 10 other comments pointing that out. Point B, it could be a typo. Judging someone's level of education by a single word is as ridiculous as judging the governor of Mississippi by his ability to spell Mississippi. Point C, apart from just this post, the "your vs you're" joke is so old and overused that even my great grandfather didn't find it funny. Point D, you really suck at generalization. Judging the entire generation's ability to understand the governance based on me not "accepting" your joke and going HAHAHA LMFAOOO is probably really bad.</TEXT>

Nobody explicitly said "Each and every single American is dumb". We just say Americans are dumb which means there is a growing number of idiots that are so prominent that they're noticeable from everywhere around the globe. That does also not mean other countries are smart. There are dumb ppl elsewhere too</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Donald Trump in no way is a large threat mainly because he is not smart enough tk do that. He keeps alternating between what he wants just to get his votes. He said he didn't like masks first then wore one. But he is very power hungry and had fired anyone that even slightly goes against his narrative. He ignored Obama's pandemic measure book, he fired staff that spoke against him in the impeachment trial. He has a ton of motives to be a dictator and no unlike what you said I don't think it's that easy to predict a dictator because they try to be sane until they have the ability to go complete coup style. If people knew Hitler was gonna cause a world war 2 he wouldn't have been elected in the first place.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>1. Not downplay the virus at the beginning and should've been more stringent about the pandemic restrictions people should've followed. 2. Apart from just closing border he should've performed contact tracing in early February. Yes, I know even the WHO didn't take it seriously until the end of February, but Trump didn't take it seriously until April lmao. 3. It is not less likeable to say that the country is under a virus threat. It does not make him a less desirable president. However, making his followers understand the seriousness is what makes him a good pres. Over optimism is not great in times like these.</TEXT>
