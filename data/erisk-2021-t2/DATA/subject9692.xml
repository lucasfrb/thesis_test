This was on my first pair that i got replaced, not because of these problems, but because it just stopped working completely. When i replaced the headset with a new one i chose the same one, hopeful that it was only that one. But no, the same problems occured on the second one. It IS a good headset, but for the price...

    <TEXT>Yeah I looked at GMK laser as well, but I like the look of Godspeed better. And I think I can handle the long waiting time. I don't have a lot of spare money, so I probably won't let myself buy more keycaps before Godspeed ship date anyway. Although, that is easy to say right now of course. Thanks for the advice!</TEXT>

    <TEXT>So I built my first keyboard a few hours ago! It's an ISO DZ60, but right now I have a few problems. The button to the right of left-shift is not outputing anything (the one Ansi doesn't have) and neither does the one to the left of right-shift. Right control registers as right arrow, and right shift registers as arrow up. So what is wrong here? Is it just an issue with layout that I can change in windows? I have another ISO board plugged in and all it's keys are working. I hope it's not my soldering :/ Thanks</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Hi, I was finally able to follow your instructions. I managed to install the drivers and flash the keyboard in QMK toolbox, but my RGB issue still remains unfortunately. The only lighting mode i can use is still breathing. Will play around a bit more, and see if I can figure it out. Edit: Also tried adding mapping another rgb mode to a specific key, but that doesn't work either.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>But don't you think it's people like you ESL are hoping to reach with this move? I would say Twitch is better for the fans who know when the games are on, because for a lot of people Twitch is not really a site you just go and check every now and then. On Facebook however, there are always people browsing their feed. If ESL can have their games appear in the feed of their millions of followers, I believe a lot of casual fans like yourself would just tune in for the same reasons you gave.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Well, I don't think ESL are trying to get your grandparents to watch, like some are implying in this tread. I think it's more about the 850k people who have liked the ESL counter strike page on Facebook. If people like OP has a game with, as you put it, an attractive title appear in their feed, I think it's quite likely they will pop in. I agree with the Youtube sentiment tho, but that probably just camedown to who bid the highest.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>No, didn't downvote :) Maybe you're right. You seem to have looked more into it than I. However I know that Hareide has a history of not picking Christensen, and most pre-world cup articles and podcasts I've read and heard are at least unsure if he will start. I'll stay away. Maybe he starts vs. Peru but probably not all games. Also don't think Denmark has great clean sheet potential anyway. :/</TEXT>

    <TEXT>That makes sense. For fantasy tho, is he really an option? As I said I don't fancy Denmark's clean sheet potential in more than 1 game, and Christensen is priced at 5. Maybe I'm wrong, but I think you might have some national bias here. Nothing wrong with that however. I would probably pick at least one player from my country if they were in the world cup too. :)</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Don't know where you're from, but this is certainly not true for every country. You have to remember that stuff from China is cheap. Like really cheap. They have no way of knowing you are lying if your invoice says you bought your t-shirt for 2$, because theoretically that could be true. I've sent several hauls and customs have opened them all except for one. The reason being that the invoice/receipt is incomplete or fake. After sending the fake invoice from superbuy it has went through every time. I won't pretend it's like that in every country, but it's true for some. At least many of those where reps are legal. Also, where do you have this blacklisted address thing from? Could I get a source on that?</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Well as I said this is especially true for countries where reps are legal. Of course, if customs open your package and see branded items declared as 2$, and reps are illegal, you're fucked. And I think that's your point. But my point is that in many countries importing reps is legal. So if customs see a branded item declared at 2$ they might ask you for an invoice, but if you then show them an invoice where it says 2$ then they have no way to prove it's not true. You could also just straight up tell them it's fake. I'm not saying your logic is wrong, it just doesn't apply to everyone.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>No, I think you're wrong. You know how many cheap ass packages customs process every day? It's a lot and half of them are valued under their real value. No country's customs have resources to hunt down every one. What they can do is ask for a complete invoice. A shirt could easily be worth 2$, and if the invoice says so they can't just deny that because in their personal opinion it's worth more.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I don't think you understand what I'm saying. So lets imagine we're in a country where reps are legal. You ship your champion hoodies, off white t-shirts, palace jackets and whatever else. You declare it as 20$, right. So customs opens your package. They see all these branded items declared at 20$, and think somethings up. So they ask for an invoice. Then they get an invoice where the off white is worth 2$. Now they have no way of knowing if this is fake or not, right? But here we have a case of innocent until proven guilty. If you say it's worth 2$, and your invoice backs it up then they have to believe that. Their alternative is essentially to go to court, which is not worth their time. They can search up champion and see that a retail piece is not worth 2$, but a fake can be worth 2$.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>They can say that if the invoice does not list all the items in the package. Agents don't list every item on the side of your package because it might increase the odds of it getting opened. But once you send a complete (but fake) invoice, it will go trough.

    <TEXT>That's a great summary, thanks. Custom's resources is something a lot of people seem to not understand. Their main focus will always be on the big commercial parcels, rather than the small personal ones we send. And even for the personal parcels the main focus will be on catching drugs, weapons etc. I recently read an article that said on average 150 000 packages from China arrive in Sweden every day. Imagine how many it is for the US or UK.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Yeah I'm well aware. At the same time he will only compete with Lamela for minutes as long as Son is absent. As you say he's been playing well in pre season and there are some rapports that Lamela has picked up something as well. For the start of the season Lucas could provide great value and as he's my only short term punt I don't think I'll be in too much trouble if he ends up playing less than i imagine. But a gamble for sure, you're right. Will keep an eye out for further rapports on Lamela before I decide if I want to keep him in my final team.</TEXT>

If you go 5.0 you could also upgrade Peltier to a 4.5 Or go Firmino + Zaha/Arnie to King/Mitrovich + Aguero/Auba First one gives you more stability on your bench. Hudson Odoi you have to prepare to transfer out after gw1 or 2 anyways. Second option is just to get one of the big hitting strikers in.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Of the two: Bernardo Silva. Good in preseason and plays for a way better team. However I think there is more value among the 6.5 mids (Jota, Richarlison, Maddison etc.). That gives you money to upgrade somewhere else too.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Honestly I don't think there is anything Rashford can do to become first choice over Lukaku (who will most likely be back gw2). Also, the thing with Gw1 is that a lot of things can happen to your other players. Every gameweek you run the risk of players getting injured or getting a red card of course. But Gw1 some players get injuries due to match fitness, and some players you thought were nailed might suddenly not start. Take my team last year. Already after gw1 Fabregas got a red card and Dummett got a long term injury. If I had a player I knew would not start the next week too (like rashford), i would have 3 players to transfer out with only 1 free transfer. A -8 is not a good way to start the season. Not saying this is going to happen to you, but it's just an example of how everything doesn't always go as planned.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Honestly I think you're onto something. I just wanted to ask because it's not a name I've seen in a lot of teams and you seemed confident in having him as one of your starting defenders. Searched up some stats and just looking at attacking returns, he's got similar numbers to Alonso last season (in championship of course). If i find .5 somewhere i might even get him myself. !thanks 6.0 midfield bracket is really terrable this year. I'd honestly say go down to 5.5 and pick someone like Fraser. He plays a big part in an attacking Bournemouth with good fixtures.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Hey guys. I want a hot swappable keyboard. Preferably i want a kit or to buy parts separately. I already have switches, stabilizers and keycaps. So I guess I'm looking for a Pcb, plate, and case. I would love a tenkeyless, but the size doesn't really matter. Preferably a layout with arrow keys tho if it's 60%. I want to keep it under 150$ if possible. I've been looking at KBDfans, but can't really make sense of the different hot swap pcbs. Some of them seem to have a longer spacebar? I'm also open to look at full kits, also over my budget. All help is appreciated.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I disagree. Yes, for a long time Champion was a Walmart type brand with bad quality products which were not really good looking either. But Champion has built their reputation again to become a big brand, known for their quality hoodies and sweatshirts. Champion is a brand with history. They created the hoodie, and were one of the top brands in sportswear for a long time. The same goes for Russell. Champion made the hoodie, but Russell created the sweatshirt itself. I don't like most of the Russell brand products you could buy today either, but honestly i see a future for them as the next Champion. I really wibe with many of their old vintage pieces as well.

    <TEXT>Yeah, can definitely agree about that. Although I think Champion reverse weaves are pretty good quality they are still not up to par with what you should expect when you pay 150$. Honestly I think it's even quite lazy for a big brand like Kith to use champion blanks with the resources they have, and when they are trying to portray themselves as a brand who stands for top quality. At the same time the stuff I'm very pleased with the Kith stuff I've got. We'll have to just wait and hope for the best I guess.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>At hver av oss bruker i gjennomsnitt 180 liter vann i d #248;gnet er i utgangspunktet helt utrolig. Men hvor mye vann vi egentlig bruker i d #248;gnet hvis vi regner med matforbruket v #229;rt, er enda mer sjukt. Gjennom blant annet [denne](https://www.theguardian.com/news/datablog/2013/jan/10/how-much-water-food-production-waste) artikkelen fra The Guardian kan vi f #229; et inntrykk av hvor mye vann som trengs for  #229; produsere ulike matprodukter. Hvis vi tar utganspunkt i kj #248;tt, kan vi finne ut at gjennomsnittet for storfe, sau, svin og kylling er 9035 liter vann per Kg kj #248;tt. If #248;lge statistikk fra [Animalia](https://www.animalia.no/no/samfunn/sa-mye-kjott-spiser-vi/) spiser hver nordmann i gjennomsnitt 146g r #248;dt kj #248;tt hver dag. Gj #248;r vi et kjapt regnestykke finner vi da ut at det blir brukt omtrent **1320 LITER** vann for  #229; dekke ditt daglige kj #248;ttforbruk! Jeg er ikke vegetarianer eller veganer selv, s #229; jeg skal ikke fortelle noen her at de skal slutte  #229; spise kj #248;tt. Men det er uansett viktig  #229; v #230;re klar over innvirkningen eget forbruk har.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I have the 11 pro and for me it #8217;s the perfect size. It #8217;s got all the features of the max, but with a smaller screen and slightly worse battery life. Still the battery is the best I have ever seen in a phone. It consistently lasts me 1,5-2 days with moderate use. I can #8217;t compare with the 11 non-pro, but I can recommend the pro.</TEXT>

Navnet Mohammad i alle sine former er, som /u/nordpoldark fors #248;ker  #229; si, mye sterkere representert i muslimske land, enn noe navn er blant den etniske norske befolkningen.

    <TEXT>A big roster is the norm in many other sports. In the Premier League, clubs have to name a 25-man roster, but a maximum of 14 players can take part in a match. Maybe having a player on the bench can push the players to perform even better, and/or give them a break when they need it. These players push themselves all year round, and it really makes sense to need a break once in a while.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>No worries. Honestly, It's just OK. You kind of get what you pay for you know? The plastic case feels pretty cheap and there are some small and annoying problems. In addition to my question here, the case is a bit lopsided so I had to take off one of the rubber feet to keep it stable. Also, where you put the cable in there is a "hole" to keep the cable in place but it actually just makes it more difficult to put the cable in, and you almost have to break it each time. I use it just to test different switches now, and usually stick to something else. I'd reccomend you get something else if you have the money.</TEXT>

My advise would be to save your money for something you really like, because most likely you're gonna want something better later on anyways, if you go for a "stepping stone" now. Right now I'm sitting with 2 "cheap" keyboards that I feel were just a waste. The XD87 because of the quality and another because I didn't like the form factor. In hindsight I wish I just saved the money for something nicer. But ofcourse I 100% get that you don't want to wait, there is a reason I have 4 keyboards lol.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>[Timestamp](https://imgur.com/a/RAKHqum) [More pics](https://imgur.com/a/9Myw8aX) I have a Tada68 w/ Zealios 65g v2, low profile alu case  amp; lubed clear pcb mount stabs. The pcb has been used for a few years but works perfectly. The low profile aluminium case is only a month old and bought from KBDfans, same goes for the switches and stabs. Original white plastic case can also be included. Asking for 200 #8364; + shipping Keycaps can be included for 20 #8364; (only the original, no artisans) Happy to provide more pictures, shipping estimates or answer any other questions. If you are in Norway I can meet up in Oslo or Bergen.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Is your plan to rotate KWP and Justin after Wood blanks? If you're comfortable with starting one of them every week (both have decent fixtures), you could downgrade Wood or Mitro and get two of Jim/Wern/Martial or Rashford if you prefer that. You still have soucek first bench, and a playing 4.5 mid as second.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Generally it's better to spend as close to 100m, and get the best players possible, unless you have a concrete plan for a transfer after gw1. I would also reccomend not keeping Fernandes or Aguero on the bench first gameweek, because you are missing out on the points from another premium player that week. You could have Son, Werner, Jimenez, Kane etc. from the start and then slowly transfer them out for Aguero and Fernandes, or you could wildcard early if you think that takes too long.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>De Gea is very likely to start the season. I would guess Henderson plays cups, and might become a starter later in the season depending on De Gea's performance. I would hold on Kepa, that situation is more unclear. They might get a new keeper after season start too.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I generally prefer the second option, because you can get premium strikers more easily later if you want that. Still, you have too much money on your bench with both ASM and Soucek. If you don't plan on starting either, maybe downgrade ASM to 4.5 and upgrade Rich or Jimenez?</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I get why they want to do this in-store, it makes sense due to the nature of the collection. However that still doesn't make it the right choice to me. IMO they should either have held the collection until it's sensible to drop it in-store, or made a compromise and find an online solution. They know people will line up and risk their health for these pieces. How about the costumers in a risk-group? How about people who are supposed to quarantine? Of course people should stay home, but daily we se people go about business as usual even if they shouldn't. Maybe it will go fine, but they are making a concious decision to put costumers health at risk for their own brand image, and that's a bad look to me.</TEXT>
