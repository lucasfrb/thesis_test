    <TITLE>Escitalopram 20mg and Mirtazapine (1/2 of) 15mg</TITLE>
    <DATE>2020-02-17 20:43:13</DATE>
    <TEXT>Hi guys, im new here Im (20F) on two kinds of antidepressants at the moment to treat my extreme anxiety and slight depression. I take escitalopram in the morning and mirtazapine before I go to sleep to help me stay asleep (im also insomniac). However, the mirtazapine doesnt really work but if I try quitting my panic attacks come back. When I have a panic attack it affects my stomach the most, resulting in me having to throw up. This has led to my fear of vomiting. I know my anxiety is still very bad, and I guess my question is if it would be hard to quit antidepressants. Im planning on going to a psychologist to treat the underlying condition of my anxiety, but I was wondering if quitting my meds will really be that bad as some posts Ive read here so far. I really dont plan on taking them for years on end because its making my sex life almost non existent and ive been eating like a pig and gained 10kg/5lbs. Can someone please help me? I feel my anxiety creeping up whenever I think about quitting my meds. Thanks in advance</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Thank you so much for your reply! I havent found what helps with my anxiety as good as my meds help. Eventhough sometimes my anxiety gets so bad that I have a panic attack, while Im still on meds. I know that anxiety is just your mind playing tricks on you, which is why Ive been trying to re-train my mind to not be so negative and scared. It has helped in the past but because I just started uni in september, I really needed something that takes away my fear of failure and anxiety related to stress from school. Thats why I started my meds in the first place. It has helped me a lot but I know it's not a permanent solution.</TEXT>

I usually take my bc for 2-3 months straight and then let my period come.

    <TEXT>Reverse racism isnt a thing. Being discriminated is not the same as suffering hundreds of years of exclusion, hate crimes, racial slurs etc etc. Yes its true that the definition of racism is that its possible for each and every race, but it will never live up to the full understanding of racism. You're being discriminated. Its not the same. When you never get a job because of your race or colour, or have to hear racial slurs every single day, THEN and ONLY then do you have the right to call it racism.

    <TEXT>So its not my Reddit cake day today, but my actual birthday. Its been a little over a year since I left home because my mom was toxic and violent. I went to live with my uncle for a couple of months until I finished highschool. Then afterwards I moved to another province/city to study. I live about a 1hour car ride from my family and most of my friends also study somewhere else. This is my first time ever celebrating my birthday all alone. And while a lot of my family and friends have messaged me and wished me a happy birthday, it still feels weird. Ive been thrown into the adult life while I wasnt exactly ready for it. And I guess celebrating your birthday alone is another "adult life" kinda thing. My boyfriend is coming over tonight so that makes it a little bit more fun. I try to keep a positive mindset, and still take a day for myself to not go to my 2 classes, not study, and just worry about myself for once. :)</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I bet if Daryl knew what would happen, if he knew Negan was serious about it he wouldnt have said a word. Daryl is (next to Rick and Glenn) one of the most loyal to their group. They took a big chance killing off a loved main character like Glenn. But then they killed off Carl and im just confused as to why they would take such a big risk. After Glenn, a lot of people stopped watching. That must have been a big hit for the producers.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I actually highly suspect he's cheating on you. Why else would he suddenly change his mind? I think a baby would tie him up to you and he just doesn't want that. You need to follow your heart, if a baby is what you want then a baby is what you should get. Being a single parent won't be easy but its better to be happy with your baby alone than to be in a 'situationship' where you're unhappy. Your baby deserves a happy mom. Goodluck</TEXT>

I put up with it because besides that she was an amazing friend. However, I couldn't deal with her racist bullshit anymore. The fact that I shared a video about people who should just mind their business when seeing a black person, and leave them be instead of being a racist asshole made her mad was just another drop in the buck which made it pour over.</TEXT>

One day I snapped and yelled that he had to leave me alone. The teachers ofcourse saw this and thought I was the one bullying HIM. I was mad but I was also a kid so I didn't say anything. Next playtime break he left me alone and the teacher congratulated me on not bullying him anymore. I have a lot more but thats the one that stuck by me.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>If you haven't felt withdrawn symptoms by now you will most likely not feel any. I once changed from mirtazapine to trazodone, that didn't help me so I quit that too after taking it once, and after that I immediately felt withdrawal symptoms from the mirtazapine. Didn't realise it at first that that was what it was so it took another few days for me to realise so I started to take mirtazapine again but 1/2 of a 15mg tablet instead of whole. So if you've been off for 3 days ant don't feel anything, you probably won't have symptoms at all.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Be cautious though because mirtazapine is an antidepressant. If you keep taking this your body will become used to its work so it won't be easy, and healthy, to just stop. Always consult with your doctor or psychologist before quitting medication.</TEXT>

In the book you know all their thoughts and you know halfway through the book that there's something wrong with Jack. While in the movie, he just acts a little bit strange and you dont really know there's something wrong until he goes bezerk. Love the book. The movie, not so much.</TEXT>

    <DATE>2020-05-23 19:12:31</DATE>
    <TEXT>In a question I asked on r/suggestmeabook a head full of ghosts was the number 1 scariest book according to a lot of people. I just read it and well, thats just simply not true in my honest opinion. The first few chapters are disturbing, yes. But scary? No. Once you realise that its just a girl with schizophrenia, everything is so clear a result from that mental illness. The book was overall very good, just not scary which was disappointing. However, it does read as something more nonfiction than fiction but still. Very good.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>No I got that part. But being someone who has experience with mental illness in my family, such as schizophrenia, I know how it can out, so eventhough it sometimes seemed like it was something paranormal, it was also a sign of just plain mental illness. The fact that the sister Merry wrote her blog and basically destructs the "show" she dismisses any possible paranormal happenings. Only the throwing up was extremely disturbing and could point to something paranormal, but still.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>My mom. She's a sociopath and we suspects she has borderline as well. She lies, constantly and she believes her own lies. Like, believes them. She always blames everyone but herself for the things that happen because of her. She is narcissistic, transphobe and racist even though she's from an other origin herself. Not to mention how abusive she always was towards me and my siblings, both physically but mostly mentally. She's so toxic, her skin is turning grey. She's lost all touch with reality, made her own reality, and thats probably because if she were to face the truth her whole world would collapse and she'd crash. I left home because of all of this. Haven't had contact with her in over a year and my life and mental health are so much better now.</TEXT>

    <TITLE>Hey guys I have a question about mirtazapine (remeron)</TITLE>
    <DATE>2020-05-27 21:57:06</DATE>
    <TEXT>Ive been taking it since September of 2019 so about 8 months, and it has done wonders for my insomnia. However, normally when I take my meds right before bed, I start to feel extremely sleepy about 40minuted after taking it. But now I dont get that feeling until hours later. I've also started to get some of my insomnia back (I used to wake up up to 7 times per night) and have noticed I start to wake up in the middle of the night again... does that mean my meds have stopped working? Do I need to change or up the dose?</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Not sure how it affects your metabolism but when I was still on remeron I gained 10kgs (I think thats about 20lbs) and I think that was mostly because of an increase of appetite. I was severely underweight so the weight gain was actually gold for me. After a while it stopped and I have since not gained any more weight which is good. But I used to wake up in the middle of the night because of the hunger so yea...</TEXT>

When it stopped helping I stoped taking remeron and honestly i haven't felt a change in anxiety so I would say that lexapro is the most effective for me for my anxiety and depression. Hope this helps</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Yes, the vet may have put the cat on a specific diet. But that doesn't mean the cat should ONLY eat wet food. It's still bad for their teeth. And if they're prone to urinary crystals it may have a completely other cause than JUST their diet. They should be on medication too and since the cat wasn't even vaccinated for rabies, I can only assume he isnt getting the treatment that he needs. She probably thought feeding him only wet food was the way to go but believe me, its not.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I never said they should ONLY be fed dry food. I said that ONLY feeding them wet food is bad for their teeth. And yes, you can brush their teeth, but not all cats enjoy that which makes the task almost impossible. As I said further on, you should follow the diet your vet provides you.</TEXT>

One day I shared a video on fb that was from a woman saying "if you see a black person, try Minding Your Own Business" as if to promote a spray. She messaged me a screenshot of the vid saying "wtf?" I asked what she meant by that but she didn't reply so after a week I blocked her. That was the final straw for me, I just cant be friends with racists.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Everything in my life is going good, and yet I still feel so stressed and anxious. I'm so stressed about school, the fear of failure is keeping their damn foot on my neck, I feel like I can't breathe. Can't study because the fear of failing is stopping me from starting anything.. sucks.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I'm Italian but barely speak the language because of my Dutch upbringing. Apparently I once had a dream where I was pretty pissed off and started cussing in italian. My boyfriend thought it was pretty funny. I was just amazed because not only do I speak Dutch in my dreams, I have had nights were I was supposedly speaking English/Spanish. So yea. That was funny</TEXT>
