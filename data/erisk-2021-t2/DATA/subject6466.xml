    <TITLE>A song for y'all: Momento Mori by The Streets</TITLE>
    <DATE>2019-11-10 15:24:03</DATE>
    <TEXT>Since I cannot share links, I just wanted to suggest that you all check the song out. It's on youtube, and most likely many other streaming services. The group (it's really just one rapper from England) is one of my favorites as he's very philosophical, and the songs are really inspirational, often addressing mental health and ways to frame things in a healthy way. The song encapsulates stoicism quite well. Please check it out and let me know what you think. Other greats are: "Going Through Hell", "Fake Street Hats", "Heaven for the Weather", "The Strongest Person I Know", and many others.</TEXT>

    <TITLE>Intensive Outpatient Care</TITLE>
    <DATE>2019-11-11 22:14:54</DATE>
    <TEXT>I recently learned of this as an option froma colleaugue. She said that she went through it before and that it was really helpful. I found out there's one about 20 minutes from my work. Four evenings a week, for 2hr 15min sessions, lasting 6-8 weeks, as needed. Thankfully, they take my insurance. I have my intake appointment on Wed. I hope that it starts soon after that. I've been struggling with anxiety for over 2 decades (I'm 47 now), and have tried therapy on and off several times, but it never seemed to help me move forward, so I would eventually trail off. I'm really hoping that this does the trick for me, as I feel kind of desperate at times. Consider researching this option if you've tried traditional therapy and it wasn't effective for you. I'll report back during the process.</TEXT>

    <TITLE>Hiring someone for motivation support?</TITLE>
    <DATE>2019-11-12 01:53:54</DATE>
    <TEXT>So, I have struggles with staying on task on... well, everything. I'm mostly yearning to be better about fitness but, more importantly, get a business off the ground. My problem is not leaziness, but anxiety and fear of failure. It's a great idea and I have no doubts about it's potential, but have decades old, deep seated anxiety, that rears it's ugly head on a regular basis. I want to hire someone that can help me stay motivated, checking in regularly and monitoring progress. Anyone ever do something like this? Any idea where I could go for something like this?</TEXT>

    <TITLE>[Hiring] Someone to help me stay on task and motivated in launching a test prep company</TITLE>
    <DATE>2019-11-12 05:42:00</DATE>
    <TEXT>I'm looking to hire someone to keep me motivated and on task with creating a business (test prep.) I'm a teacher by day, but have been doing test prep (group courses and one-on-one tutoring) and have created a unique approach that I'd like to turn into a business. The problem is that I have anxiety which creates bouts of self-doubt and fear of failure. I'm also bad at sticking to schedule. So, I've come up with the idea of hiring someone to keep me on task. Basically, create a shared calendar, and check in with my regularly, and get on my case when I'm not making progress. Seems a bit strange, but I think it could help me a lot. The person being a business major would be helpful, but it's more important that they are organized, detail oriented, and can be stern but also inspiring. If you fit this desicription, or know someone that does, please contact me. Thanks!</TEXT>

    <TITLE>Starting and Intensive Outpatient Program today...</TITLE>
    <DATE>2019-11-18 13:58:32</DATE>
    <TEXT>So, I've been struggling with anxiety for a couple decades now, and have tried seeing a therapist on various occassions, but never consistently and never to great effect. A couple years ago, it came out during couples therapy that I probably have some PTSD due to childhood trauma from an abusive older brother. Fast forward to a few weeks ago, when I came across the book Running on Empty and the concept of Emotional Neglect. Never have I had more profound insight into my mental and emotional states of my adulthood. The effects of EN perfectly summarize many struggles that I had growing up and throughout my adulthood. Around the same time, a colleaugue who also struggles with anxiety told me about an intensive outpatient program, which I had never heard of before. It's exactly what I need, as traditional therapy is too little and too slow. So, I went to the intake appointment on Wednesday and will be starting today. It runs Mon-Thur, 5-7:30pm, for 4-5 weeks, and you are to see a psychiatrist concurrently. I'm simultaneously excited but also quite anxious. This may be the first time that I actually feel that I'm moving forward, especially given the insight about EN. It's small group, though, so I'm anxious to air out my feelings and experiences. Anyway, now I'm just rambling. I guess just wish me luck, and look into IOP programs if you think it might help.</TEXT>

    <TITLE>Help! (New) cat peeing on daughter's bed.</TITLE>
    <DATE>2019-12-25 02:57:34</DATE>
    <TEXT>Is this the right forum for this? Hope so... I adopted two young adult cats (2ish) from foster car a little over a month ago. They stayed hidden in the basement for a while, but both have since warmed up to me and their new home and spent a fair amount of time with me - very loving cats - getting pets. I have two daughters (4 and 8) that stay with me most weekends. They LOVE animals and were ecstatic that I got cats. Thus far, the cats barely show face when the girls are here - and usually scamper off as soon as they are acknowledged. That's one issue, but not the most pressing. The girls were with me on Friday, and when I went to take them to bed, I saw a couple turds on the lower bunk. I cleaned them off without making mention (as the girls are already sad that they haven't been able to pet and play with them). Last night I washed the bed sheets and when I went to their room this morning, there was pee on the mattress as well as the comforter. So, two different instances. Background info: I cleaned the cats litter box last night while doing the laundry, so it wasn't filthy. They are siblings and get along well: playing, cleaning each other, never fighting. They share the litter, which I understand can be an issue, but I think they have shared one since birth. It seems intentional. Jealousy peeing? I feel bad for the cats and for my daughters. Feeling frustrated. I got the cats as much for the girls moreso than for myself. I like all animals, but am more of a dog person. Their mom and I separated this summer, so I thought it would be nice to have them around - and it has - but them not coming out when the girls are here and now this is making me seriously consider returning them. But I'd like to figure it out, if possible. Any helpful advice (one both situations, but especially the potty situation) would be greatly appreciated!</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I'm a 47 year old male. Mostly in good health. Anxiety is a persistent struggle, as well as sleep being a frequent challenge. I have a ton of supplements that I've picked up along the way. I'm not consistent about taking them everyday, but I'm setting up morning and evening routines and want to include supplements in them. My stack: * L-Theanine (Theanine Serence, which has a variety of supplements in it: Magnesium, GABA, Taurine) * D3-K2 * Iodine (Kelp) * Fish oil * B-complex (Brain Sharp from Vitamin Shoppe: b6, b12, folate, ALCAR) * NAC (n-acetyl-cystine) * Niacine * Turmeric+Ginger * Lion's Mane * Bacopa * Kava kava * Nugenix (Testofen  #8211; The main Nugenix ingredient in Nugenix, Testofen, is a specially blended ingredient, containing 50% Fenuside, derived from Fenugreek, B12 and B 6, Zinc, L-Citrulline Malate) Usually what I take each night before bed * Snooze Right (from Vitamin Shoppe): Calcium, Magnesium, L-Taurine, Inositol, Valerian, Hops, Skullcap, Chamomile, Passion Flower) * Sleep3 (Nature's Bounty): L-Theanine, Chamomile, Lavender, Lemon Balm, Valerian, Melatonin) I'm just not sure that I should be taking all of these, and if it's OK, should I be taking them all every day, and what times of the day. If I take the one's from the beginning of the list, I do it in the morning (2-3/week typically), and the only I take at night are the two sleep aids, which I take most nights. Thoughts? Insights? Suggestions? I would appreciate some guidance on this. Thanks!</TEXT>

    <TITLE>Installed the PiHole software on an RPi with Raspbian and connected to wifi; How to best utilize it?</TITLE>
    <DATE>2020-01-07 23:26:53</DATE>
    <TEXT>Forgive me in advance as I'm not super tech savvy... but here goes nothing: I've been a bit unclear as to how to use it on my whole network from the get-go, but I went to the pihole website and saw the command for installing it through the terminal, which I did. Saw in the output the dns address, but wasn't sure how to proceed. My assumption initially was that it was to be connected directly to the modem and/or router. But then I thought, "perhaps I just need to set up each device to use the dns address," but I use a VPN and that seemed redundant for any of the devices that I have that installed on. But then thought to set the dns address on the router. Went into router settings but struggled with figuring out how to do that. Through DDGing, so something about using the pihole dns address for the dhcp (which I hadn't heard of prior to attempting this setup), which I attempted but screwed up the connections to all of my devices. Eventually did a factory reset of the wifi router, got all the devices connected again and then called it a night. So, in sum, how do I best (and, hopefully, most easily) setup the pihole to be used on my whole network? Does it need to be physically plugged into my modem and/or router? If not, and I can just leave it connected to the wifi, should I just set the dns address of the router to the pihole? Or do I need to do something with the dhcp? It has all turned out to be more daunting than I had hoped, but I'm willing to fumble through it. I have a tp-link AC1750 wifi router, if that helps at all. Thanks!</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Good morning. I teach in a school in Philly that serves kids involved in the foster care system, and we're starting a mentor program for our eligible grads to provide them with some life skills and guidance beyond the academic content. Our student body is primarily black with some Puerto Rican and white students, but the mentor being the same is not essential. I think it can be valuable, but the most value is for an adult that cares and can provide insights and guidance spending time with them irrespective of racial-ethnic background. The commitment can be very minimal, like a couple hours a month, but could be more if the mentor has some availability. We've exhausted our options, but still have a few kids in need of a mentor. If you fit this bill and are interested, or know someone that fits this bill and, please DM me.</TEXT>

Edit: Which locations can you drop into? I'd like to take them to one or more today to meet some potential friends to adopt.</TEXT>

    <TITLE>Online Treatment Programs/Dual Diagnosis</TITLE>
    <DATE>2020-02-23 23:52:08</DATE>
    <TEXT>Peeps, it's been a bumpy road in my relationship to drinking and not drinking. As many of you have most likely experienced, I've gone repeatedly through the cycles of wanting to quit, thinking I was quitting, then all of sudden finding that I had mentally decided that I didn't *really* want to quit. Well, if nothing else, I'd like to convince myself to "take a break", but even when I do that, I make it about 5-6 days at best. It's clearly a problem. I started taking kratom a few months back after reading that people used it to kick the habit - and I have been much better with drinking and my anxiety has been deminished since - but I need more support than just that. I have long struggled with anxiety and that's played a role in my drinking, without a doubt. I've seen therapists on and off for that, but don't currently have one. I don't drive and am fairly busy, so taking public transit to get there is a deterent, with all the time it consumes. I heard about Better Help, an online therapy program, on a podcast recently and was all set to check it out - only to read that they sell your data to FB or whomever, so I don't want to go through there, but it made me realize that online therapy and alcohol dependence counseling might be exactly what I need. On that note, do you know of any online treatment programs? I know Smart Recovery has groups that meet online, but I'm looking for a full program. I feel like dual diagnosis is definitely in order, since the anxiety (and PTSD) are certainly related to the dependence. Thanks, y'all! I appreciate this community, though I haven't used it to get sober, you've been a source of inspiration through the years. Much love!</TEXT>

I actually just did try it with Moringa, but it's a little late to do the Matcha as well, since it's a little high in caffeine.

    <TITLE>Need help installing on new desktop!</TITLE>
    <DATE>2020-04-26 01:45:19</DATE>
    <TEXT>Hi, all. I have Kubuntu installed on an older desktop where I nuked the Windows partition completely, but recently upgraded (Acer Aspire TC-885-UA92), and want to dual-boot. But I'm not having success. I used Rufus to install it on a flash drive, turned off Secure Boot in the BIOS, and Fast Start in the control panel, and resized the partition in Disk Management, leaving space for Kubuntu, but when it gets to the Disk Setup stage of install I get an error: "ubi-partman crashed"..."failed with exit code 141". I've looked these up on DDG  amp; Google, and tried what was recommended: go into a live session and install GParted, but when I try to add a new partition, "new" is grayed out. Any ideas? I'm getting desperate at this point because I've been at it for a while. Debating opening the case and adding the SSD from my old tower to the new one... maybe that's the best idea anyway? Any help would be greatly appreciated!</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Hi, I'm starting a new path where I'm creating a daily routine that I want to stick with in order to work on self-care (meditate, yoga, journal) and a couple creative pursuits (a test prep program that's been in development for years  amp; a memoir). My primary issue is that I struggle with anxiety and fear of failure, but when I have deadlines and someone I'm beholden to, I can be very productive. I just panic when I don't have a set schedule. I do alright at present with chipping away at each of these, but I don't set a schedule and stick to it. My plan is to make a schedule with a daily checklist and time-chunking. My goal is to review my day at the end, setting up the schedule for the next day, then starting each morning with reviewing it - and staying with it all day. I think that primarily what I need is someone that I have to share daily and weekly updates with, so that I have deadlines and have to have something produced to share with others. Anyone looking for an AB that can help me with this and need someone to do similar for them?</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Hi, all. I'm a lifelong anxiety-sufferer due to C-PTSD  amp; CEN (Childhood Emotional Neglect) who has been very reluctant to take prescriptions for my issues. Until now. So, I'm seeking people's experiences so that I have some ideas of what to discuss with a psychiatrist. So, I'm starting to recognize more and more that so many aspects of what I thought were my personality, but am starting to come to understand as likely results of my trauma. E.g., terrible sleep, terrified of public speaking and potential rejection of possible mates, frantically keeping my mind busy for fear of the self-loathing that will arise if given space for it, alcohol dependence, incompetent finances out of fear, regular anxiety attacks, constant body pain - back in particular, inability to follow through on most anything, irritability, always being on edge. I've long naively hoped that I could dig myself out of the whole just through diligence, and worry that if I ever tried to come off the meds, that it could lead to suicidal ideation. I've been doing a lot of other things in the past couple years that have lead to vast improvements: regular exercise including yoga, meditation, journaling, limiting alcohol intake, whole foods diet, supplements, kratom  amp; hydration, psychotherapy, and about to start EMDR (tomorrow - yay!) But I'm starting to realize that this all might not be enough. At least for the time being. As my understanding is advancing I'm realizing just how deep the effects of my trauma have been, including struggling to follow through with my mental health goals due to a kind of scatterbrained lack of consistency, fear of failure, and fear of facing my trauma and getting healthy finally. So, who here has found a medication that helps them deal with the deep-seated effects of trauma? What have you tried? What are the side-effects? Any additional info that would be helpful in my research? Thanks for anyone that read that whole tome and any info that might come from it!</TEXT>

    <TEXT>This is a plea for help... Well, assistance. It's not as dire or urgent as it might seem. I'm all alone this weekend, won't have my daughters, have nothing pressing that needs to be done, and I'm starting to go a little stir crazy. Just bought a new car a couple months ago, and I'm not afraid to use it. Good people of r/philadelphia: Get me the fuck out of the city! Where should I go? What should I do? I'm up for most anything and am definitely a nature lover. Suggestions, please! People, I need you - before I lose my freaking mind... HELP!!!</TEXT>

Any of the relaxing supplements should for something similar: not necessarily cause positivity, but at least open up the space for it: theanine, holy basil, magnesium, chamomile, ashwaganda, kava. Some don't like it discussed here because it can be addictive, but the most effective of all has been kratom. I have layers of anxiety provoking irritability, but kratom almost completely eradicate it for me for a solid 4-6 hours at a time.

    <TEXT>Agreed. That's my absolute favorite aspect of march madness, seeing some little known player play out of their goddam mind and right into a lotter pick, like Curry, Adam Morrison, that Georgia State coach's son, etc. It's where legends are made, in addition to the conference tourney. In regards to UM, the 2 tournies are where Derrick Walton went from being a very solid guard in Michigan history, to probably top 10, when he just went berserk. Had he only hit that game winner against Oregon, he might've approached top 5 status.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Please check out Dr. David Burns. He authored a seminal book called Feeling Good 40 years ago, but is about to release the update, called Feeling Great. He has a free podcast that details his approach. It will have a profound imapct on your life. One of the key tools is the Daily Mood Log and examining your thoughts for "Cognitive Distortions" - as was mentioned in another post, you need to be a scientist of your thoughts, and know that they are not actually who you are. Secondly, practice Meditation on Loving Kindness: you can find guided ones on lots of apps or free on youtube. Thirdly, use affirmations periodically throughout the day, which is a type of self-hypnosis that you will slowly internalize after repeating them day in and out for a few weeks, which will radically shift how you feel about yourself. Most importantly: love yourself! You don't need to be loved in order to feel loved. You must love yourself first and foremost, and no one can do that for you!</TEXT>

I know that people despise the exynos processor, but I have it all setup beautifully and it runs like a charm. I've long yearned for the S-Pen and cannot believe that I got it for sub-$400. The only two drawbacks in moving from the s9 is no wireless charging (not too big of a deal) and it doesn't have MST, so I can't use Samsung Pay with magnetic readers (bummer). Otherwise, I'm totally pleased with it.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I have zero complaints thus far: * Yes, it's a plastic back but it looks and feels fine, plus it comes with a clear case, so you wouldn't know what material it is anyway. * It's the same processor as my s9, which is supposed to be not great, but it handles everything I do with no problem at all. I don't play processor heavy games, so it doesn't affect me. * I just moved to Google Fi, and bought this unlocked on eBay for less than $400, and the SIM card worked fine in it * Screen looks beautiful and is responsive to both touch and s-pen * It doesn't have a rating, but people have reported that it's gotten we without issue I watched a couple YouTube reviews which is what sold me. The complaints voiced were minimal in the grand scheme of things, compared to the value you get. It was almost shocking how much you get for so little. My only concern were: no wireless charging and it doesn't have MSC (I think it's called), so no ability to use Samsung Pay on magnetic card readers, which my s9 had and is a really nice feature. Those tradeoffs were worth getting the s-pen for.</TEXT>

You might get a little high from it, but the way I dose, I don't get any high at all. I take about 5g anywhere from 3-5 times/day. It's very subtle.

    <TEXT>So sorry to hear of your situation, bud. I can only imagine. I just wanted to make a quick recommendation: Have you tried kratom before? I have CPTSD and loads of Anxiety issues. I recently discovered kratom and now take it daily for both anxiety and chronic back pain. It works wonders. The good news is that it's legal (in most states) and it's just the leaf of a plant. Usually it comes dried and ground up. You can make tea with it, put it capsules, or just shovel a spoonful in your mouth and gulp it down. It's really had a profound impact on my life and significantly stabilized my mood. I'd recommend keeping a bag around for, at the very least, replacing your psych meds when needed.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>This right here is one of the most important points for us to take into account in our understanding of our present moment, as well as to how to improve things beyond this horrendous shitshow we are living in currently. There absolutely must be mechanisms developed for meting out consequences for political skullduggery in order to move forward. I'm older than most on here (mid-40s) and have been hyper-invested in politics since around the time of W's first term. First off was the stealing of the election that should've elected Gore, and then the BIG one was just lying their faces off to justify an illegal war that has killed countless people, and brainwashed a large swath of the country into believing that it was OK. Now, I know it didn't start there; we've been descending into this pit of hell for decades prior to that point, but that might've been the inflection point: Steal and election, lie to the public to justify a BS war that enriches you and your cronies while killing thousands and thousands of innocent people. THINK. ABOUT. THAT. Once the craven bastards that are money- and power-hungry saw that, they knew all bets were off. Anything was possible at that point. That's how we got trump. Now, I don't believe that he's the evil mastermind behind this whatsoever, there are teams of thinktanks and such that study how power operates and they recruit, train, promote, and support that worst dregs of humankind that will do anything for money and power and then they plug them into the system. So, the orange turd was just the next body that they could plug into their system. Knowing that he lacked all morals and decorum, they knew they could push him even further than they ever did W - their previous useful, moralless, imbecile. And that's how we got here. But we wouldn't be here had Obama and his justice department hadn't immediately stepped in and given them, as well as the financiers that broke the world economy in order to enrich themselves, a free pass for all of their past crimes and transgressions. As soon as that happened, I realized that all the "Hope  amp; Change" was a bunch of empty rhetorical bullshit. So, in many ways, the previous administration was as much a a determining factor in this equation of hellishness as W  amp; trump. Therefore, we need to clamor for laws and policies that punish those that abuse the powers of their office. There's a lot more to say about this, but I'll leave it at that for now. To avoid things getting any worse than they already are, we need tools for meting out consequences for politicians that abuse their office.</TEXT>

People that have serious mentla health issues, when they hear bullshit like this, might think that somehow their suffering is their own fault, or they might be complacent and think, "I'll just wallow in my misery, because time while heal all of my suffering..." But it doesn't, so they're wasting time waiting for healing to just come of its own accord, while most likely making things even worse.

    <TEXT>I know that it's difficult to accept responsibility for making misguided statements and getting called out for it, but trying to point the finger at the person providing the critique and assuming that there must be something wrong with that person, rather than actually thikning critically about the incorrectness of your statement, and it takes maturity, but that's what's called for in this instance. So, grow up, recognize that you're not only wrong, but you're actually stating something that can mislead people. Yes, you're right that a piece of advice is not applicable to all people, and yelling about it doesn't really add to your point, but when you use superlatives like "all", as in in the phrase "time heals everything" and "it really does", then you're actually contradicting the main thrust of your post. And, yes, you are resposible for your words. If you tell someone something that's wrong and they believe you, and that ends up being harmful to them, then the onus is on you. Don't make statements as though they are some type of absolute truth meant to help people and then turn around and claim "It's not my fault people listened to me and believed me."</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Hey, there. I tried to complete it, but received the error message as well. If you're going to do forced rank like that, I'd recommend trying to be more clear and concise with a clear distinction between the options. I have a background in psychology and have always dispised the traditional tools of psychology research for forcing the complexity of reality and human existence into hard and fast categories or numerical values, though I see some value in the practice in general (I just always find myself frustrated in trying to answer a significant amount of the questions - my brain just doesn't work like that.) The problem is that the statements you are asking teachers to evaluate are a bit convoluted. It's clear that you put a lot of thought into them and are trying to capture some of the complexity of the tasks of teaching but, in doing so, it made it a hurculean task for me to comprehend each one and then try to rank it against the other three. I could force myself to do so, but in so doing it would lose much validity, at least for me. In sum, if you can simplify and clarify each, such that they are clearly distinguished from the others, it will make it much more feasible for a teacher to rank one against the others. Secondly, I'd highly recommend a clarifying comments, open-ended space. I'm sure many other teachers do not having clearly defined goals for the hypercomplexity of things like the role of curriculum, assessment, instruction, and the teacher's role in relation to each. Providing educator's the space to elaborate might elicit considerably greater insights. Thirdly, because I'm white from a predominantly white town and teach in the innercity with mostly non-white students, some of the terms used are highly problematic for me - "culture" being primary here. Black culture is a nearly entirely separate culture from that which I hail. It's not that "never the twain shall meet", but it's nearly so - at least in some highly significant respects. Again, though, if you provided a space for me to elaborate, I could clarify my rankings with some nuance on such terms. I feel like there was more, but I cannot recall the rest, if there indeed was more. Hope that helps anyway! Cheers.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>That could be part of it. I've long thought that my CPTSD emerged due to high levels of stress, that combined with my CEN (childhood emotional neglect) left me without the tools for processing several extremely difficult life circumstances that hit simultaneously. The result was crippling anxiety and self-destructive self-medicating with alcohol. It certainly was not the result of having an over-abundance of safety, by any means. Of course, it could be the fact that there are multiple pathways.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I'd recommend that you look into kratom as a short-term aid, but procede carefully. It operates comparable to an opiod, despite the fact that it's not from the poppy plant; it's actually in the same family as coffee. You consume the dried leaf, typically ground to a powder. There are active alkoloids that affect the opiod receptors. I've been on it for a little over 6 months now, and it's done wonders for a couple decades of intense anxiety. I've always tried to avoid drugs, SSRIs and Benzos, though I typically kept klonopin around for severe attacks. I now take a few grams 3-5 times a day and never have the attacks that I used to have. It's turned everything down a bit/taken the edge off. An incredible side-effect is that it's helped me break a highly self-destructive dependence on alcohol. It's worth its weight in gold for that alone. I am still in psychotherapy (EMDR) and would like to eventually not need to consume it daily, but I'm OK with taking it as long as needed to keep my anxiety to a minimum and not feel the intense need to drink in order to cope. There's a sub for it, as well as one for quitting it, for those that did get addicted. I'd recommend reading up on it and treading lightly. I did my due diligence before trying it out and approached it very cautiously - and remain very cautious in my use. I've never felt angrily compelled to take it as one does with addictions. I can get busy and not think to take it without any kind of addiction behaviors of "fiending" for it. Good luck, friend. Anxiety is utterly overwhelming and certainly had me in the place of suicidal ideations, seeing a future of myself on the streets in shambles, and putting myself in positions that were life-threatening because I just wanted an end to the suffering. It's a terrible place to be. I won't say that it's eradicated every problem in my life, but it has indeed done wonders for me. Best wishes.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Sure, no problem, homie. It's an extremely common grammatical error. It doesn't really matter, and most people probably don't even notice it, but I just share it on occasion assuming some people would like to know the correct form - especially because there's an easy trick for figuring it out. Similar to when to use "whom" instead of "who" (which is also a subject v. object issue.) Just remember the sentence: "Who threw the ball to whom?" The "who" is the doer of the action in the sentence while the "whom" is the recipient of the action.</TEXT>

How has he gone through life being able to do whatever he wants, despite failing at everything? He's completely moral-less, which allows him to stoop to any depth. And he still won the election by convincing "the salt of the earth" that he really was that completely fake creation on TV: a succesful business man. I couldn't do it. I don't think most people could. It requires a complete lack of compassion for the other person's perspective and a willingness to do anything to pull the wool over their eyes.

    <TEXT>Yeah, I know why it's expensive, but the markup is absurd - probably due to the fact that most don't know or think to make it themselves. Once you've purchased the dehydrator, the labor is minimal. Slice it thin, marinade it in the fridge for a while, spread it out on the trays and come back in 6-8 hours. Save a ton of moolah in the long run. Want to add that it's also a matter of being super convenient. I have two young kids and we move all about a big city doing activities. Keeping a bag in the car for a quick protein re-up on the go keeps from having to buy expensive snacks or meals while out. Highly recommended!</TEXT>

I sliced it thinly, then put the it all in a freezer bag, kneeded it, and put it in the fridge for a while. Then threw it in the dehydrator.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Yeah, I'm with you. When I first saw the headline about KA, I wondered what kind of ploy was at play: Jumping from the burning ship? Etc. But when I saw the headline later on that G was also stepping down, I realized that there might've been some validity to the original headline about KA. IMO, there's no more important task in the world than being a good parent. Nothing should supercede that. Once you have a child, you give up your indpendence. That's not to say that you should neglect your own needs, because you need to take care of yourself in order to be the best parent you can be (a huge mistake that I made in the early years of parenthood). I've done my best, given my personal limitations, to completely give myself over to the task of tending to the needs of my children. If everyone that parents a child took this task to heart as the most important thing they will ever do, this world would be a much improved place for us all.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Agreed. I think it may be the most destructive force in the world in my lifetime. Nothing has had a more devastating reach than Faux "News". Think about what has changed from the era when politics weren't so divisive, and people could work across the aisle like, say, a John McCain. Where they had different politics but didn't hold vitriolic hate towards members of the other party. They were from an era where everyone got the same news from the same TV news shows and newspapers. Now there's an entirely different set fo information that one side is getting versus the other, so there's no common ground whatsoever to be reached. Obviously social media, FB and Twitter being central here, have played a significant role mroe recently, but FN was the primary source of disinformation during W's reign, and the divisions were just as deep then - and what lead to the rise of trump. Literally, for the sake of a sane world, FN needs to be dismantled. I don't know how else we are ever going to have a a country and politically system that can work together for the greater good of all citizens.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Hey, fellow anti-trash crusader. I moved to Manayunk last summer and the amount of trash was driving me insane every time I walked around (which I do a lot.) So, I reached out here and on Nextdoor. Found a group of passionate folks that wanted to not only help clean but plan and make it a consistent practice. We had a couple planning meetings and then put together a big event. Someone from the group put it on FB, and flyers were made and posted around the area too. Also, a member of the group reached out to local businesses to get material support and we were gifted a ton of cleaning supplies from a local hardware store, a bunch of pizzas, and were supposed to get coffee as well, but not sure what happened with that. It garnered a couple dozen people and we accomplished a mind-blowing amount in a single morning. It was a stunning success, netting 70-80 industrial sized bags full of trash. We intended to keep it going, but covid hit right in the midst of it and the meetings were discontinued, as I haven't had the energy and focus to continue it. (It's starting to get bad again, so I'm thinking about reinvigorating it again soon.) Anyway, that's what worked for me. I'm sure if you take similar steps, you will find a ton of support from like-minded people. Good luck!</TEXT>

    <TEXT>So, I made the switch recently - foolishly before coming here to read all of the tales of woe, but here we are. So, I'm a bit confused with using Voice with Fi. Are we supposed to forward our calls to Voice? I tried following one support page which led me to legacy Voice where I had to enter a code into the dialer, which was supposed to take care of that, but I got an error message. I might conjure up the courage to call support tomorrow, but I've spent too much time with technical difficulties in switching too many things lately (cable, phone, and bank... yes, I am, indeed, a glutton for punishment.) Anyway, what are all you good people doing on Fi? And how did you make it happen? Thanks, in advance!</TEXT>

I had the s9 which was great with Samsung Pay because you could use it even on regular credit card magnetic swipers, since some stores aren't capable of taking regular electronic payments.

Look, this is an insanely complex situation with multiple moving targets. Being uncertain as to how to proceed for the safety and best interests of the plethora of people involved in CFB does not mean that the decision makers aren't smart. Are you implying you could do better? Have you never reversed course or course corrected regarding a big and difficult decision? I know I wouldn't want the task that could potentially result in people dying, not to mention cost people their livlihoods.

    <TEXT>Hey, everyone. I just wanted to take a minute to share this very powerful resource with you. I've been listening to the audiobook and I haven't even gotten all the way through it yet, but it's already had a profound impact on me - especially the concept of "emotional flashback". If you haven't checked it out yet, please get on it as soon as possible. Bonus info: Your local library might have access to the app "Hoopla" - which is an amazing resource in and of itself - which has the book on there. I've been listening while taking the pooch for walks over the past couple days, and it's been rife with insights. It's so good that I'm going to purchase the phsyical book in order to take copious notes. Please do yourself the favor and at least look into the audiobook on Hoopla, and if you don't have access, the book is well worth it, I assure you.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I'm so glad to hear that. Hoopla itself is such a great resource that not enough people to know about. I'm somewhat new to the PTSD diagnosis, despite being in my late 40s, and it's had a profound impact on self-understanding. The Body Keeps the Score (of which, Hoopla has some helpful summaries), which I'm reading currently, blew the doors open for understanding all of my "personality quirks", and now this book is even kicking it up a few notches higher. It's really profound stuff. "Emotional flashbacks" is a deeply illuminating insight.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>It took my years to accept the diagnosis, and then start to understand it and what to do about it. For me, learning about it has been a great relief. It's helped me understand numerous personal and social challenges from throughout my life, and given me faith that there are solutions and that I can get better. The first step for me was another book, called The Body Keeps the Score, which is the one I learned of first, which provided the initial insights about what was happening in my body and brain due to the PTSD. I would suggest that you try your best to be excited that you now have the keys to unlock an understanding. It's daunting, and will take a lot of time and work, but at least you now have some answers and some tools for addressing challenges you've probably struggled with for years.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I hear you, brother/sister. The more that I've come to accept my diagnosis, the more I feel validated and finally in control. Two very important recommendations: (1) Complex PTSD by Pete Walker will radically change your self-understanding, especially the concept of Emotional Flashbacks (if your local library has Hoopla, the audiobook is FREE on there! But, you'll probably want a copy - because it's that important); (2) The Body Keeps the Score, of which there are summaries on Hoopla too - I knew of the book but never was pressed to pick it up until I listened to the summaries while out walking, and it was the first major step in my understanding myself and all of my wonderful "personality quirks"; (3) Polyvagal Theory, which is covered in BKS, but you can watch youtube videos on it - there are also several books with polyvagal exercises available; I just ordered one by Deb Dana, but haven't had the chance to crack the cover as yet. Beyond those, as you will learn in BKS, yoga and EMDR are two highly effective tools for managing symptoms and healing your inner-injuries. There are some wonderful trauma-informed yoga videos available for free on youtube; I'm particularly fond of those from The Trauma-Conscious Yoga Method channel. Anyway, congratulations on learning a kernal of truth about that which has plagued you your entire life. It's difficult, but truly liberating. I know for me, at times, it feels a bit overwhelming because you're fighting and uphill battle, especially if you're older like myself (was diagnosed in my mid-40s) and fighting the inertia of decades of self-destructive habits, and coming to the realization that your health and healing is now fully in your own hands. Just develop and return to some mantras/affirmations and repeat them often when feeling overwhelmed and remind yourself that you're safe now and that you have the tools to improve, though it may be slower than you'd like, and that you're committed to becoming whole again.</TEXT>

I'm just one of those update dorks that gets frustrated when I have to wait ages to get a major update (like when I had the v20 and didn't get the system update for like a year.)</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I really appreciate that, slut  #10084; #65039; I've been really blown away by the first for seasons. I never watched BB because the premise wasn't compelling and I'm anti-violence, but being a HUGE Bob Odenkirk fan (going back to the Mr. Show days), I finally took the plunge and started BCS last year. I started thinking as I neared the end that now I need to see BB, despite my reluctance. I would assume the violence is minimal, as with BCS. BTW, when you say "it's so good", do you mean season 5 specifically, or the whole series? I watched the preview last night and it made me so hyped for it.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Cool, thanks! I think it's my second favorite show of all time, behind Mr. Robot. But I don't watch much TV and have never seen the highly touted shows like Sopranos, Mad Men, BB, Game of Thrones, etc. Damn, knowing it's much more violent, I'll probably skip it, then. Thanks for informing me. I'm highly sensitive to violence and even the scenes in BCS are a bit much for me.</TEXT>

I need to go back to it, because I'm not sure that I even watched all of season 3 and beyond, but I loved everything I've seen so far. Really appreciate the alerts about the violence. It's been fairly manageable thus far.</TEXT>

    <DATE>2020-09-05 15:58:17</DATE>
    <TEXT>So, my shipment of the above just arrived and I'm seeking advice of how to best use each, as I'm a noob to these noots. I have a full day ahead with lots of heavy cognitive load to bear and would like to utilize one, two, or all three of these for my first time to crank out some productivity. I think I read to take Alpha like 30 minutes prior to Phenylpiracetam, but I'm unclear on dosages. Also unsure if there are any potentiators. Should I eat first or take on an empty stomach? Should I take Phenibut seperately, like a different day or can I take with for a super boost? I would deeply appreciate any guidance. I've read of each for a while, and finally took the plunge, but I want to maximize the benefits and minimize the drawbacks. Thanks in advance!</TEXT>

    <TITLE>ANGER- How to not react to my temper?</TITLE>
    <DATE>2020-09-05 20:16:30</DATE>
    <TEXT>Hey, everyone. I'm brand new to this sub, fairly new to the concept of CPTSD, and kinda new to the PTSD diagnosis. I'm in my late 40s and trying to understand the effects of my childhood trauma, and then undo all of the unhealthy repercussions of it. As you all know, it's a long uphill slog. There's some improvement, but in fits and starts. The most pressing issue for me at present is not acting on anger-impulses. I'm typically a calm, kind, and caring person. But I snap on occasion, totally dissociate, act nearly the opposite to what I would like to (rage), before finally coming out of it - and then left with shame and embarassment. My ex once described me as bi-polar, which I believe refers to exactly that. What have people here done to put some separation between an event occuring and responding? If I even think about the situation for a minute before flipping out, I realize that I don't want to act in accordance with that anger, and then make healthier decisions - but how do I learn to not immediately react to situations that provoke that rage? At present I take tons of calming supplements, take a couple walks a day, peridically do yoga (couple times a week, but aiming for dialy), and sporadically meditate. I'm guessing that making the yoga and meditation daily essentials would probably be key pieces to the puzzle. What has worked for y'all?</TEXT>

I'll go a couple weeks without it periodically, but when the stress and frustration builds and builds and builds, I start leaning towards it again. I try to keep it to a minimum, but I should really just decide once and for all to excise it from my life - after all the trouble that it's caused me. It's just really enjoyable for me, and I really enjoying having some ciders, listening to music, and chilling out.

    <TEXT>I really appreicate your lengthy reply in my time of need. Very helpful advice. I need to commit to daily practice of both, rather than reading political news which just makes me feel livid and helpless - obviously not health inducing whatsoever. I spent many years skateboarding which, I've realized since, really help me blow off steam. I didn't really have rage like this in those days. Then my body started falling apart and I couldn't do it anymore and my life got too busy for me to tend to my needs, which I didn't even know what they were, because taking care of my emotional needs was a completely foreign concept to me until recently. So, the issue is that I'm 47 and my body aches all over all the time. I thought it was the drinking, so I cut way back, but the chronic pain persists. I'm now trying to cut out gluten and dairy in hopes that will help. But I could see a martial art helping, for sure. I think there are a couple near me that I will look into.

    <TEXT>This is all great to hear! I have some stuff to write (test prep with an emphasis on test anxiety). I've been doing it for years and have a unique approach that is very powerful, but when I sit to write, I get very anxious and fill of self-doubt, and it's so frustrating because I have a lot to share. So, if this helps me feel empowered and able to be confident and work though it, it will be fabulous! And I'm a music fiend, so I love the sounds of that. Might have to listen to the whole Carmina Burana later today :-D.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I used to think that my IBS was due to me excessive alcohol consumption, but I cut it way back - with long breaks in between - and it didn't stop it. I've since cut out both gluten and dairy (not easy!) and I haven't had any incidents. I feel like it's most likely the gluten... Shoot now that I think about it, I had some wings last week with wing sauce (butter) and blue cheese, and it was back the next day - so it probably was the dairy (they weren't breaded, so no gluten.) Something to consider, despite how daunting it is. Perhaps even a full elimination diet, if you can manage it.</TEXT>

I think she was referring to my raging anger that emerged seldomly contrasting with my generally affable and easygoing nature. On the other hand, she was also a bit socially blind, not recognizing that I had valid issues with her behaviors (or lack thereof) that I expressed repeatedly with my complaints always falling on deaf ears. Then I'm crazy because my anger got the best of me after that recurred over and over. "Empathy deficient" - ahaha... Yeah, probably applies too. Thanks for your words of support.

    <TEXT>Glad you caught my typo there. I'd recommend buying a big bag of pure matcha and brew it yourself. Much cheaper and then you can control the sweetness. For example, I put a tbsp of the powder in a cup and whisk with just a couple ounces of water, then fill the mid the rest of the way with oat milk and heat it up. After that I sweeten with raw honey and sometimes add different spices, for flavor and health: black pepper, cinnamon (Ceylon), and/or ginger.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I'm in full agreement. When I first started to learn about it more in-depthly, around a decade ago, I got really excited and started explaining probiotics and predigestion to as many people as would listen to the ravings of a lunatic, then started fermenting everything I could.

    <TEXT>Thanks, sib, for your detailed reply. Yeah, it seems that nearly 100% of my blowups occur after slipping and not meditating consistently for a spell. My intended morning routine is to, after feeding the pup, dosing kratom and taking my supplements, take a nice long walk with the dog up and down steep hills, to get the cardio in, and do trauma-informed yoga. Then, after showering, do the tapping solution (which another redditor just introduced to me), meditate, and journal. Seems like a lot, but if I'm up at 6am, I should have time to do it before leaving for work. Would be helpful to do some more afterwards, certainly walking the pup, but some days I'm just wrecked by then end (I teach foster kids in a big, violent city), so I can't guarantee it. But I can definitely ensure that I complete the morning routine. I have faith and hope that if I do it daily, it should certainly help. I also just received "Polyvagal Exercises for Safety and Connection" by Deb Dana, which should provide even more tools for quelling those outbursts.  #129310;</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I've been reading Complex PTSD and Walker's idea of "Emotional Flashbacks" and the triggers that provoked them, has been eating around in my brain for a while, so I'm trying my dernedest to be more attuned to both of those. I'm notoriously emotionally r*yarded - or so I've long referred to myself. The trauma has taught me consistent dissociation, along with a masculine culture where feelings are BAD and SCARY, so suppress, suppress, suppress, and deny. So I cram them down and deny them access to my consciousness habitually. I'm trying to work on that, but being 47 and having those nasty habits so deeply ingrained and entrenched, it's a step uphill slog. I'm getting there... Slower than I'd hope or desire, but it's just the battle I have before me. I'm also trying to just general be preemptive about addressing my excitation, too keep it to a minimum, hopefully in order to minimize the potential for a thermonuclear disaster. Anyway, I appreciate your thoughtful reply. Cheers!</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Sorry, I forgot to address the most important part: I'm rooting for you as well! I wish my wife had more sympathy and understanding. She just continued to do things that triggered me and then blamed me for getting angry. I know that I shouldn't have gotten as angry as I did and acted the way I did, but she said much more hurtful things to me than I ever did to her. And I apologized afterward. And she didn't. Had she made the effort, we could've worked it out, most likely - but I'll probably never know. We separated a year ago, and I think papers are being prepared as we speak. I hope you're husband is more understanding than my wife was! Let him know you're trying your damnedest, given you're limitations! Have you asked him to read Body Keeps the Score? Or Complex PTSD? (Hopefully you have and, if not, GET ON IT!) Or even have him watch some videos with those authors, it listen to podcasts with them, then share with him how those insights illuminate your struggles. I'm rooting for you! And hope it doesn't get to the point of being irreparable, as situation became.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Thank you! It's so hard not to, after beating myself to a pup my entire life. I try not to wallow in self-loathing all the time, but it's deeply ingrained. And it's not incessant. Sometimes I feel very good about myself: I've accomplished A LOT in my life and done some really laudable things, and I feel good about those. I just have very exacting standards for myself, and don't go easy on myself when I don't meet them. :-( But you're 100% right. It's been a long, hard road. And now I'm looking at the poor little 4 year old getting brutalized by his psychopathic big brother, and realize that's what's underlying all of my hurt and self-loathing, and it's just not fair to poor little fella, who didn't even have parents that would help him when needed, so he was left out to sea too soon or swim. He/I didn't sink, but the struggle wasn't without casualties. You're right, I needed to be better to myself. Thank you for your kind words of support  #10084; #65039;.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Yeah, the intended routine is a lot. Maybe it's overly optimistic, but I think it's manageable. The walk I can do in 20-30 mins, the yoga routine is under 10 minutes, and the tapping solution only takes a couple minutes. My meditation routine is a 20 minute site (using Insight Timer!), and I can do a short journal session. I found move that to evening, but I really just want to do a check-in each morning, since I often dissociate and lose touch with what's going on inside, so I don't address it, then out emerges during the day in an unhealthy way. So, it's just intended as an emotional check-in, and looking forward to some things I want to accomplish for the day. So a quick 10 minutes should suffice. Then I commute to work on foot (thank the Lord!), during which time I focus on my breath, or work through any planning for the day, kids I need to address, etc. I love your idea of setting the meditation reminders throughout the day. I've been intending to do something like that, but want sure which app/service to arrange it through, so I really appreciate your suggestion. Some ohms periodically throughout the day is a beautiful idea. I also want to check if I'm in an emotional flashback and to repeat some mantras at those times. Gotta run, but thank you for the stellar ideas!</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I appreciate your thoughtful responses. She didn't really do so knowingly, as much as just didn't seem to care to change our address it. When you tell someone something over and over, and they don't seem to care to change, it starts to feel intentional, which is what provoked the anger. Honestly, I think there was some classism, because her parents are fairly wealthy and my upbringing was more working class, plus my siblings have issues too. So, it's like it have her a free pass to put the blame in me, rather than take any personal responsibility. Anyway, I agree: I didn't want to go the divorce route either, but that's her prerogative. Yeah, I think if you share with him some code videos with van der Kolk (Body Keeps the Score), Pete Walker (Complex PTSD), and Deb Dana (Polyvagal Theory), it will help you understand yourself much better, and help him have some sympathy and understanding, or so I'd hope! Just get one of those books at a time and work through slowly - they will blue the doors off your self-understanding! Guaranteed. Trust me: there's nothing better you could do for yourself right now. Having some clear ideas of what we are experiencing and why is extremely beneficial.</TEXT>

This book, The Body Keeps the Score, and When Panic Attacks, along with Steven Porges' and Deb Dana's work on Polyvagal Theory are all masterpieces for those of us that struggle with CPTSD. Highly recommended for everyone that wants to learn what's going on inside and the pathways for healing.</TEXT>

We raised up and clamored enough to get them to go to a hybrid model, but when we returned last week we found out the director took covid money and bought new lunchroom tables!!! Like, WTF?!?! A colleague asked if we were having regular cleaners come in to clean the building - and she said "we don't have the money." "So, where's the covid money?" "It's been spent - on the tables and stuff." Un-fucking-believable. I'm sure the same sheer stupidity has been repeated ad nauseum across the country by incompetent morons.</TEXT>

It's more like a way I learned to relate to reality That's exactly why it's an emotional flashback: because you're responding to current emotional stimuli in the same way that you did when young in order to protect yourself. It's typically not the helathiest way at present as we're either over-playing a risk or over-reacting in some other fashion, due to what we learned to do habitually in the face of psychological, emotional, or physical danger. In other words, you're right about the way that you see it, but it's just that that *is* the definition of emotional flashback.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>For those not familiar, the author, Pete Walker, wrote a masterpiece called Complex PTSD, where the concept of "emotional flashback" is elaborated upon. It's highly recommended - and will most likely have a profound effect on your psycho-emotional well-being. You can find PDFs and EPUBs of it free online. Also, your library might offer Hoopla accounts with your membership, which has the audiobook available. That's where I've been accessing it. Take a LONG walk once a day while listening to it (I think it's about 7 hours long in total). You'll get the numerous benefits of exercise and being outdoors, along with being enlightened on your condition, and the paths to move forward.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>First of all, I'm sorry to read that you are feeling like the only way out of your pain is through suicide. I can't closely relate to the feeling - and spent many years thinking that if it weren't for the effect that I expected it to have on my mother, I would have proceeded to end it. And, you know what? Now that I'm a little bit into the clearing, I'm not so sure that it was that valid of a concern (I'm sure my mom would be upset, but she's a bit emotionally distant due to her own childhood trauma), but much moreso a cry for help, internally, and a convenient reason for not proceeding. Perhaps that's the same for you? Now, I'm not trying to claim that I'm completely out of the dark woods, by any means, but I'm starting to get a bit clearer about the miasma that is my psycho-emotional reality. What I would urge you to consider is doing all of the self-care acts that are well-known to promote one's well-being: regular exercise (a nice, hearty walk every day is adequate), eat well, sleep well, do things for others (volunteer, clean up the neighborhood, etc.) Then, the things that are specific to PTSD: therapy (EMDR, specifically)  amp; yoga (van der Kolk says these are the two most affective for trauma survivors), as well as meditations on loving kindness. This may be the most important for you in the present emotional flashback! I know it's really hard. I've spent a good portion of my life in deep self-loathing and it's almost repellent to try to list things that I like about myself. And there are several things that an outsider might consider valuable traits and characteristics, but it makes me sick to think about feeling good about myself sometimes. Meditations on loving kindness are well-researched to be one of the most effective mood boosters, and for good reason. Your self-loathing is a deeply entrenched mental habit, and therefore it's hard to break it. What does it take? Repetition. Constant replacement of those feelings with feelings of love and appreciation for others and self. The more that you do so, the more it becomes habit. Do it a couple times a day, if needed. There are free guided ones on youtube, and through various apps and such. Get started immediately and make it a daily practice. You will find more and more that those mental habits start to dissapate and get replaced with the opposite. Best of luck, friend!</TEXT>

It doesn't excuse their racism, hate, and any terrible things they do, byt any means. I feel fairly strongly that this is the case, and us hating them and fighting with them, is just perpetuating and deepening the divisions that the rich and powerful benefit from. And feeling hate and expressing it doesn't lead to our own healing either.

    <TEXT>Bringing a tear to my eye just thinking about it... Don't get me wrong, I love Coach Howard. Absolutely hyped that one of the Fab Five leaders returned to his alma mater - combined with the fact that he completed his degree on time, while a rookie, because he promised his grandma that he'd graduate on time. Sadly, and tragically, his grandma died ... I think after he committed to Michigan, so he continued fulltime classes while beng a rookie with the Bullets - with significant minutes. It's an incredible story. And, get this: he can coach. And this: and recruit. And he just seems to have that same Beilein charcter of being humble and really gratedul, as well as being a deep strageical mind, and he's just so happy to be back. Point being: I still miss Beilein, but I ain't complaining.</TEXT>

Who knows? Did he actually care about people and change and then find out that he'd be murdered if he fucked with the power structures in any way, shape, or form, so he was contented with rearranging the deck chairs?

    <TEXT>First of all, make sure you get good rest. Last year I was having a hell of a time getting out of bed whether the weather was cold or not. I now get to bed early most nights and listen to a guided meditation to help me get a deep, unencumbered sleep in. Additionally, I take a number of herbal supplements, minerals, and amino acids (L-theanin, glycine, magnesium, etc.), and that has made a world of difference in terms of my sleep quality and, subsequently, my ability to get out of bed early. Secondly, some apps have a feature where you have to scan a QR code to turn off the alarm. I use Sleep as Android (not sure if there's an quivalent for the iphone line). It even has a feature where it won't let you power off the phone to get it to stop. Once I'm out of bed, turned off the alarm, peed, and drink a glass of water, I'm fine with continuing to move. Those two things have made all the difference in the world. Just last year I had a work meeting with the head honchos because I was so consistently arriving late.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Yes, that would be be both fine and great! That fee is perfectly reasonable (nay, more so) and managable. Sounds really ideal in terms of what I'm looking for. I DEEPLY appreciate you taking the time to help me out with this! I've been in therapy for a while, but the more tha tI learn about CPTSD and participating in discussions on the sub, the more I realize all of my frustrating "personality quirks" that have been plaguing me my entire life are results of my trauma and that having a like-minded/like-experienced group of people to relate to would do me wonders, and possibly help me to start to feel semi-sane (What the hell would *that* be like?!?!) So, again, I am deeply indebted to you. Especially because my efforts at self-understanding and growth and improvement are so often met with a brick wall to my face, which just then serves as a deterrent to making any other efforts. Until my life starts to crack apart again and I realize "Oh, yeah, I'm still fucked up and in need of significant support."</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Hey, there. I was in a similar boat when I first encountered NAC, and promptly started taking it for anxiety, alcohol dependence, and temper issues. It seemed to help somewhat (and I still take it for all those issue), but it wasn't until I discovered kratom that I finally started making some progress with my drinking. I've been taking it daily for probably 9 months now, and I'm lightyears from where I was when I started. I usually drank at least 3x/week, with chugging wine with vodka in it. But I just went nearly two weeks without drinking anything, then had 3 ciders last night. I never would've been able to stop at 3 drinks previously. Now, kratom has it's own risks. I read about those carefully and have approached it with caution. I know it can be addictive because it operates on the opiod receptors, but I don't have any kind of addictive emotional response to it. I can take it or leave it, but when I don't take it, my anxiety starts to pick back up (it's very much a corporeal anxiety, with shortness of breath and heart palpitations.) So I tend to take it 3-5 times/day. It has drastically curbed my anxiety, so I don't need the alcohol for self-medication purposes anymore. I sleep better now. I eat better. My life has improved drastically since starting to take it consistently. I'd highly recommend you looking into it; just proceed with caution, if you do.</TEXT>

I have my daughters most weekends, typically til dinner time. I could make it work, but a weekend evening would be the ideal for me. I also typically tutor online in the late afternoon. I would be interested in hosting a discussion group myself, if that makes sense. I made a post recently about looking for an online support group and several redditors have responded that they'd be interested in one as well, so I've been considering hosting one myself for the past couple days. Perhaps even a hybrid group where the first part is group support and the latter (however much time is remaining) devoted to book discussion. I could do it weekly in the evening time, for those that have that time slot available... I don't know, what do you think?</TEXT>

    <TEXT>So, you're operating on some erroneous assumptions. The two have been very close from very early on, and the emphasis on Milton being a "project" implies how much of a higher ceiling he has. There have been several reports that the staff was as hyped about getting a commitment from Milton as they were about getting Rashan Gary, the number one recruit in the entire country. Think about that. That alone should completely undermine your whole line of thinking. Dylan was not, not had he ever been, the "heir apparent". He was in a dog fight the whole time, being 2a to Milton's 2b all last season. Yes, he was more prepared coming in, and therefore was the first in behind Shea, but it's not inconceivable to grasp that Milton has surpassed him since then. Why is such a simple turn off events so hard for you to fathom that you immediately turn to some wildly uncalled-for assumption of locker room culture problems? That's something for you to consider. It kinda wreaks of some underlying bias. Now, I don't care to be throwing *that* card around, but it's something you should take a close look at. Whatever the case, you're completely misguided. Dylan got surpassed by Milton fair and square and there's no need for a conspiracy theory to explain it away.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Yeah, I'm with you. These anti-Milton posters are exaggerating the difference between the two and it implies some serious everyone bias of some sort. Some people might brandish an accusation here, but I'll refrain. Occam's razor is applicable here: Milton has the higher ceiling, was rough coming in, but has put the work in, and it's now superceding Dylan. Why is that so difficult for these conspiracy theorists to grasp?</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Total budget and country of purchase: US. $400 or less. Happy to go with a refurb with older hardware to get a better deal. (E.g., Newegg has some aroun $250 that look to fit the bill.) Do you prefer a 2 in 1 form factor, good battery life or best specifications for the money? Good battery life How important is weight and thinness to you? Would prefer on the lighter end Which OS do you require? Windows, Mac, Chrome OS, Linux. Linux, probably Kubuntu Do you have a preferred screen size? If indifferent, put N/A. Between 13" and 15.5" Preferably 14"; don't want to go bigger, but could go smaller Are you doing any CAD/video editing/photo editing/gaming? List which programs/games you desire to run. Nothing power-hungry. Mostly browser and libre office. If you're gaming, do you have certain games you want to play? At what settings and FPS do you want? N/A Any specific requirements such as good keyboard, reliable build quality, touch-screen, finger-print reader, optical drive or good input devices (keyboard/touchpad)? An SSD is a MUST. At least 4 gig of RAM, but would like 8. Backlit keyboard is probably too much to ask at this price point, but would like to have it if possible. Leave any finishing thoughts here that you may feel are necessary and beneficial to the discussion. Would prefer to avoid HP, Dell, and Lenovo. Asus, Acer, or a lesser known (as long as decent) brand would be preferred. I checked TigerDirect, Walmart, Overstock, and Newegg for refurb deals, with the latter having several that fit what I'm looking for, I'm just worried that I'm overlooking a better source. I can't image since I found 14" (HP  amp; Dell) with i5 (4th gen?) with 8 gig of RAM and SSDs for sub-$250 on Newegg. Probably won't beat that, but thought I'd check, just in case.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Hey, there, frugaliens! (OMG, that's perfect: Frug-Aliens! Ahahahah....) Anyway, I'm looking for the best sources of refurbished laptops. I need a new one, as my keys on my chromebook stopped working, which a powerwash didn't fix, so I'm assuming it's a hardware issue. I'm not a power user, but would like something with at least 4 gig of RAM and an SSD. Also looking for something thin and light, ideally. 14 inch screen or smaller. I plan to install Linux on it (Kubuntu for life!), so it would help if it's Linux-friendly. I already checked Walmart, Amazon, TigerDirect, Overstock, and NewEgg. Found several that fit what I'm looking for, with the latter being the best. Several that are sub-$250 with i5 (4th gen, I believe), 8 gig of RAM, and an SSD, with the 14" screen. That's probably the best bet, but since I don't get to buy a new computer very often (even an inexpensive one), I wanna find the best deal I can. I feel like there's some secret trove of refurbs out there somewhere, but that's probably just my anxiety speaking.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Thanks for pointing that out. I gave it a cursory glance before replying to you. I've since been looking closer at it, and realized that it is quite light. I've spent several hours between last night and today weighing lots of options and checking out every site that might have a good deal, and I'm now starting to conclude that the x1 carbon from ebay is absolutely the best bet. So, thank you for the suggestion! It was totally on point. Now, the question is do I pull the trigger on the 3rd gen with an i7 for $385 outright, or do I sit on some of these auctions for 3rd gen and newer and see if I can procure an even better deal?... I'm really torn because that looks like an amazing deal, but there's that fear rattling around that I could pull some great auction upset and get something newer for a decent deal... I should probably just pull the trigger since there's only one left - and I don't wanna miss that deal waiting for a better deal that never comes. Oh, the anguish!</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Already a couple good responses below. To co-sign the below and add my own: First and foremost: Keep reminding yourself that you are safe now! You're in fight or flight mode because you've perceived some kind of danger, so you're falling into an autonomic state of seeking protection. Keep taking slow deep breaths (see #3 below), and repeating to yourself that you are safe now and there's no need to worry. Beyond that, there are several things you can do: 1) Cold water! Splash it on your face, drink a tall glass of it (like chug down a whole pint), and/or cold shower. Immediate relief! 2) Ibuprofen actually has anxiolytic effect. You can also pop a sleep aid if you have one around. My anxiety is so often high, that a sleep aid just brings me down a bit, and doesn't actually knock me out. Rite Aid/CVS has one called Sleep3 (you might've seen commercials for it) is a really nice one with melatonin and various herbs. 3) Box Breathing 4-7-8: Inhale to through your note to a count of 4, completely filling your lungs; hold breath to a count of 7; exhale very slowly through pursed lips, making a deep sigh with vibrations in your chest, to a count of 8. You can tweak these numbers to meet your needs. 4) Hot tea also helps a lot: green, black, white or herbal - especially chamomile, lavender, mint, valerian, etc. There are dozens of nice relaxation/sleep teas. Try out a range. 5) Guided meditations on YouTube. When I'm anxious, I typically don't want to go out in the world, so I like to put headphones on, play a guided meditation, and cocoon myself in blanket. 6) Exercise: Increasing your heart rate really helps. It can just be up and down stairs in your house if you don't want to get outside. But nature really helps. My favorite is to put headphones in, get into nature, walk briskly, and listen to a good audiobook or podcast. There are a ton of Mindfulness-based podcasts, which really set a nice tone; e.g., AudioDharma. If your library offers Hoopla subscriptions, there are some great audiobooks on there that pertain to anxiety and trauma: Polyvagal Theory in Therapy (Deb Dana)  amp; Complex PTSD (Pete Walker) are both stellar! 7) For future: There are a slew of supplements that help with anxiety: L-theanine, magnesium (there are various kinds, so research which kind; I take Glycinate), ashwaganda (ksm-66), holy basil, chamomile, valerian, lavendar, passion flower, kava kava, CBD (works for some, not for others). And, somewhat controversially, kratom. This is something to approach cautiously, as it has alkaloids that operate on the opioid receptors, so it can be addictive. Honestly, though, I've never had anything better for my anxiety than kratom. I don't feel fiendish for it when I can't take it, and it doesn't give me any kind of high. Sometimes when I take it in the morning on an empty stomach, I can get some euphoria. But I'm not very sensitive to getting a buzz, so it doesn't do much in terms of a high (which is fine), but it is 100% effective in diminishing my anxiety issues. Something to consider if your anxiety is as debilitating as mine was. It also helped me significantly reduce my alcohol consumption, which I used to self-medicate, and was completely destructive in my life. Good luck! There are methods for addressing it.</TEXT>

In the meantime, there are some crutches you can employ: You can use a mantra or affirmation. Because I have anxiety from PTSD, I often repeat "You are safe now." You can simply county to 4, then start over. So you're just trying to inhale thought free, then count on your exhale. You can also do box breathing: Inhale to a count of 4, hold your breath for 7 seconds, then exhale to a count of 8. The constant starting over if counting repeatedly disrupts the flow of chatter in your head. A final suggestion is to trace your fingers of one hand with a finger on the other. Inhale as you move up, and exhale as you move down. Focusing on that task makes it harder for your mind to wander. Best of luck, friends! It really pays off, eventually.</TEXT>

    <TITLE>Late On-set  amp; Crisis of Vision</TITLE>
    <DATE>2020-09-23 11:25:31</DATE>
    <TEXT>Morning, peeps! A couple things that have been on my mind as I flail around and attempt to recover: 1) How many of you on here had late on-set of symptoms of CPTSD? Part of what has made this journey and struggle such a challenge is that I didn't have many overt, self-destructive effects of my trauma until later in life. I went to grad school in order to try to make the world a better place (the social and racial inequalities in the U.S. weigh so heavily on my soul), and watched that crumble, while my wife at the time cheated on me, and I watched W have the election stolen for him (2000). This triple crisis weighed so heavily, but I also didn't have the emotional tools for processing any of it (I also suffer from CEN - Childhood Emotional Neglect), nor the ability to seek and procure the necessary assistance. That's when I started to break down, anxiety attacks began on a daily basis, and I started self-medicating more and more with alcohol. That was 20 years ago, and I've never received effective care for the anxiety, continued to have attacks, and continued to struggle with alcohol dependence. It wasn't until a couple's counselor suggested that I had PTSD from childhood trauma about 8 years ago, which has only slowly sank in more and more. Then, last year I learned about CEN (from the book, Running on Empty), and I came to realize how much my parents - who were actually great parents otherwise - being children of trauma themselves, never provided the essentials for emotional development. I was a HSP (Highly Sensitive Person) and being physically and psychologically abused by my older brother as my father told me to man up and deal with it myself, so I learned to bite my lip and take it all in stride, packing the injuries down underneath wound after wound. And having friends that came from much worse situations, I was always lead to believe that I had it really good. And I did in many ways. And I try to be grateful for what my parents did do. But that masked the trauma and lack of emotional tools. It was only a few months ago that I started listening to The Body Keeps the Score, which then lead to Complex PTSD, and Deb Dana's work on Polyvagal Theory, that all of the pieces started to really congeal. So what I'm coming to believe is that the conditions were set for me, with my psycho-emotional ecosystem being very limited and just scraping by (there were many effects of the trauma and CEN, but they were more manageable, and I just took them to be inherent personality traits, despite them being really maladaptive - "because I had such a good home life". Then, when the triple whammy of life crises hit simultaneously, my system couldn't bear the burden - and that's when the more significant symptoms from the CPTSD really emerged. Anyone else in the same boat? Where your CPTSD symptoms didn't surface until later in life, in the face of significant life challenges? What's your story? And what are you doing now to work through it? I'm still operating on so many erroneous assumptions, and it's a challenge to root them out and replace them with a better understanding of who I am and how I got here. That ended up longer than I had intended, but I still want to address the other issue... 2) Has anyone struggled with a vision for an appealing future? I'm gainfully employed and scraping by OK, but I feel like I'm really just spinning my wheels, and not progressing toward a truly fulfilling life. I had a vision of being a scholar in academia, married with kids in a university town, with a nice backyard, but that was erased when I became jaded with academia, and I haven't really been able to develop a vision for the "good life" ever since. Anyone else have that challenge? Anyone been able to work through it in order to develop a vision, instead of just subsisting? I have some really important projects that would be very fulfilling and help people, but I struggle with the motivating and self-doubts. I feel like if I could just see clearly some vision of a brighter future, I might be able to garner the emotional energy to stick my neck out and take the risks needed to start to bring that vision into reality.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I liked Rudock too, and think he's been our best QB in the Harbaugh era. That first season, after he adjusted and settled in, he played very well - and provided us a lot of hope that we'd be much improved post-Hoke disaster. It was a fabulous season by Hoke standards. All in all I really liked him a lot given all of the circumstances. I just wouldn't say that he was spilling over with swagger, that's all. That's why it was just a small joke. Honestly, he had some really tough runs that got us out of tight spots in important games, which could definitely qualify as swagger, for sure. I'm optimistic about Joe as well, though. Sad that DMac didn't pan out, being that he's from a football family of the higest echelons, and it just doesn't look that good since coach has had two very well regarded recruits not pan out (Peters and now DMac.) Especially frustrating since that's kind of what we thought would be a key part of the deal in Harbaugh coming home. I guess I'm not prone to being pessimistic and crabby, and am still holding out hope that Harbs will finally hit a homerun with a QB recruit, so I'm going to remain optimistic that Joe will finally fulfill that promise.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>The challenge with this question is that life consists of an impossibly complex set of interlocking parts that are all constantly in flux and affecting each other. It's kind of a chicken and egg sitation with considerably more than two parts, but we can narrow it down to a handful of essential pieces to the the creation and maintenance of a healthy social reality: 1) Humans need to be born from a healthy mother with the necessary components for healthy development. In other words, maternal and paternal health is the first part of the equation, including minimal stress, regular exercise, and healthy eating while the mother is pregnant. 2) The newborn needs a healthy and safe home environment with parents that know how to fosters secure attachments. 3) The developing child needs nutritous food and stimulation with a lack of trauma during the formative years. * Those all preceed schooling even starting. 4) Then schools need to be funded better. But I would argue that what precedes us even getting students into schools is far more important. So, that means our whole social and economic structure needs to change, because many parents don't have viable work, and even if they do, they might not have access to or even knowledge of, healthy cooking and eating. And they many very well not know healthy parenting techniques. On top of all that, they need to be willing and capable of choosing healthy food over more appealing food. And they need to have their own mental health issues addressed so that they can even be capable of treating their children with the care needed to produce and maintain a secure attachment. So, we need an economy that provides good work for all of our citizens. We need our food system made to provide all citizens, including those currently living in food deserts, capable of providing healthy foods for everyone, while simultaneously making junk food less appealing and less available. There's much more to it all than this, but that's the many thoughts off the top of my head, as I teach my innercity foster kids and continue to think about these issues every day and how to make a better world for all of our people.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Good God, the delusions and misinformation from those that didn't live through the horrendous W reign is disturbing. He was not a smart man and his legacy is NOT up for debate. He was trump lite and he set the stage for trump. You all need to stop with the bullshit. Those of us that had to live through that era, closely scrutinizing all of the GOP's machinations know all too well that everything that's happening now already happened when the GOP had their useful idiot in W. Now they have the same stupid puppet, but he's just more brazen. Fucking stop it.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Thanks for this comment, because that was my concern as well. I'm a father of two young'uns and have always tried hard to limit their intake of artificial garbage, which has kept me from sharing lots of my childhood favorites with them (jello, kool-aid, every type of candy, etc.) so I'm always trying to recreate those experiences but with whole and healthy foods. Additionally, I have lots of joint pain and take collagen powder in my coffee, so I was trying to discern a way to apply this post for both my sake and my girls'. Do you mind elaborating on the dessert? The girls love sweets (of course!), but I want to do it in the most healthful way possible.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Thanks for this insightful post! Currently a teacher of foster kids in the innercity and father of two young'uns, and also a graduate of a psych program and studied human development in grad school, so questions of this sort are always on my mind. I haven't had the time and energy to keep up with the research for the past couple decades. Do you have any recommendations for recent books that synthesize the more recent developments in social psych, or psych in general that pertains to child/human development? I've been yearning to get back to it, but have been consumed by literature on trauma (both for my own sake, as well as my students), but would like rethink my general framework. I'm especially interested in perspectives that are rooted in an evolutionary  amp; cultural perspective. I studied at U-Michigan in the late 90s with an emphasis on the faculty in the Culture  amp; Cognition program (Lawrence Hirchfeld, Scott Atran, etc.), as well as a wealth of Cultural Anthro coursework. But since then I've been teaching math in underfunded schools and raising kids in an attention demanding city, while struggling with a less-than-ideal marital relationship. Sorry for the TMI, but the point being, now that I'm in a space where I can start to think clearly I want to get back to my roots and think back through my core ideas of human development with updated research, as well as bringing my newfound knowledge of the role of early trauma to bear on that information.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>When you feel that way, remind yourself that you are in an emotional flashback. (See Pete Walker's "Complex PTSD" or his website, for more info on this concept.) I only learned of this concept less than a month ago, and it has profoundly improved my mental and emotional state. Whenever I'm feeling anxious or worked up or angry, I just keep on alerting myself to the fact that I'm in an emotional flashback and that I don't need to feel that way at that time, reminding myself that I'm safe now and that I don't need to mobilize my defense systems. I like to personify my emtional flashbacks as who I was at the stage when I learned that emtoional response to danger. Talk to that younger version of yourself, telling him/her that everything will be OK and that you are now safe. Also, when I meditate (which I try to do daily), I use the following mantra: (Breathing in) "I'm JUST breathing at this time" (Exhaling) "Because I'm safe now and have nothing to worry about." The goal of this is to shift your baseline of constant worry and anxiety to one of calm and safety. The longer that you do it, the deeper your relaxation will be in a resting state This is really profound - and is probably something ALL people need to do daily (because we're all fucked up on many levels through unresolved trauma.) I strongly urge everyone try this practice at this very moment, and try to return to it as a mantra repeatedly throughout your day. Set reminders on your phone periodically to breath deeply and remind yourself that your safe, as well as do so anytime you start to have that panic feeling well up from underneath, or any other point that you feel excess emotion and are not sure where it's coming from.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>This is controversial - and I don't see it listed on the things you've tried, but I would suggest you look into kratom. My issue is anxiety, not depression, but it has worked WONDERS for me. I'm 47 and struggled for 2 decades with debilitating anxiety, and self-medicating with alcohol (like, bad). I've been taking it daily, purely medicinally, for about 9 months. I barely drink ever, and may be on the verge of completely quitting - especially after having cravings lately and just talking through how it will actually just make me worse off. The anxiety it still there when the kratom wears off, but I just redose. I take it 3-5 times a day. It just completely takes the edge off, allows me to be a semi-normal human, and get my shit together and take care of all the crap in my life that I used to avoid. I'd research it extensively, especially in regards to interactions with what you are taking already, looking over posts on /r/kratom and give it a try. It's saved a lot of people from bad places, including depression, anxiety, and severe drug addictions. It's perhaps not a "miracle" drug, but it's the closest thing to it after a lifetime of social and emotional challenges.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I'd recommend counting your breaths on exhale. Count to 4 and start over. When you realize your mind is wandering (almost immediately) tell yourself "I'm just breathing right now." Just feel all the sensations that are involved in the process of breathing. Fully engross yourself in the act of breathing. Meditation is not about emptying your mind per se, but stepping outside the incessant stream of thoughts, and just existing. The more you practice this, the more you realize your thoughts are happening to the "I", which is the silent observer. You are not, in fact, your thoughts. It's a very empowering realization. Additionally, by turning your attention away from the chatter and returning to your breath, you become more and more attuned to your own embodiment, and the thoughts quiet themselves.</TEXT>

I've been stuyding Complex PTSD (book by Pete Walker) recently, both for my own sake, and for my students (I teach older kids who are in the foster care system) and I'm more and more coming to the realization that the majority of trump supporters suffered early developmental trauma. Think about it: how could *anyone* look at this guy and not realize how much of a grifter he is, and how much his tough-guy act is just that, an act... You must be severely lacking in your ability to perceive the reality around you. There's a lot more to say, but I've run out of time, but you've read through this, think about it. I think what our country needs to heal is to address the source of such a delusional support network, which is early childhood developmental trauma, IMO.</TEXT>

We've all seen lots of comedians annihilate hecklers before; presumably those are all improvised, by their very nature. Unless you think that in some cases comedians plant a heckler, just so they can use pre-written jokes to take them down? I'm saying that if your a professional comedian and trying to attack Philly as a city, and that's the best you can come up with, it's pretty weak. I know people are going to downvote because reddit deifies Burr, but I'm not too concerned. My point stands: it's a corny attempt at a comeback/putdown. First of all, it's so far from the truth because there are bridges all over the city. And secondly, that's the worst you can come up with? There's plenty to critique about Philly.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Well, I guess that I haven't thought it through that deeply, so I'd struggle to formulate a coherent analysis and explanation. Like I said, I've been studying the topic for my own sake, due to my own childhood trauma that I'm starting to come to terms with and work through. That's what led me to the book initially. Additionally, because I teach innercity kids in the foster care system, this research is obviously very applicable to them as well. But since encountering this literature, I've started to have the stark realization that many supporters of trump - those that are appealed to with his (obviously fake) tough-guy braggadacio and hatred and belittling of the other - are coming from a place of hurt and weakness. As much as I despise their xenophobia, and used to harbor a lot of hate for those voters, going back to the W days (who was trump lite in this and many other respects), I'm starting to feel some sympathy for them, as I realize that it's almost certainly motivated by their own early childhood trauma and abuse. Are you familiar with Attachment Theory? In child psychology (my undergrad degree), it's possibly the most valuable concept in the entire field. Attachment to a caregiver predetermines, to a very large degree, life outcomes for all people. "Secure attachment" to a or both caregiver(s) is the ideal, which provides for a safe base for the psyche to develop, providing a haven to return to, while one goes out in the world to explore, expand, and develop, while taking risks safely - knowing that your caregiver is there to catch you when you fall or get in harm's way. When you don't have that, it infects your inner-emotional response to "the other" and any potential risks you encounter the rest of your life. Another concept, one from the trauma literature, is Polyvagal Theory. The idea inherent is that our nervous system predetermines our responses to risks and threats PRIOR to our brains even catching up. We often act as though our thoughts about something determine how we act towards them, but that's erroneous. Our nervous system responds automatically, and then our brains - the prefrontal cortex, in this case - then *justifies* our behaviors, after they've already occured. Why this matters is that, if these supporters are children of trauma and insecure attachments, then when any potential risk or fear is provoked - scary muslims, the deep state, etc - their nervous systems have been tuned to overreact and thrown them down the dorsal vagal path of fight or flight. The comical thing is that typically they are taking flight our of fear, hiding behind big daddy trump, and then projecting their false toughness as though they are ready and willing to respond by fighting, or having their surrogate do so for them. In sum, they were traumatized by abusive and uncaring parents, so they didn't have secure attachments that allowed them to develop a strong innersense of strength and stability, so they're forever seeking it in an external source - in their case, their guns, trump, etc. - and their nervous system is overreactive to the slightest hint of danger. When provoked, their nervous system hurls them into fliight or fight mode, where they're really fleeing, but projecting fighting through their "strongman" (fake one, in this case) of guns and trump. Sorry if that's not totally clear, as I'm still working through my thoughts on it, but I feel strongly that it's accurate at its heart. I just haven't clarified my thinking or explication of the mechnisms at work. Hope it helped, at least to some degree. The really pressing question is what do we do with all these poor, damaged creatures who, instead of invoking sympathy, by their hatred of everyone else, makes themselves so detestable that no one wants to be sympathetic and supportive? I'm honestly really consumed by it right now, but I'm still working through the implications of the ideas for my own developmental needs (I'm 47, struggled with intense anxiety for a couple decades, which I self-medicated with alcohol, which destroyed my marriage and most personal relationships, so I'm just trying to heal myself while maintaining my work and my relationships with my 5 and 9 year old daughters, who are in the next state with their mother these days.) As well as thinking through the implications for my students and how are school can help them cope with their trauma, heal, and become healthy and comeptent adults. From there, I want to try to figure out how to heal all these poor schmucks who have somehow been duped by the ost pathetic loser imaginable as some kind strong and successful business man, despite all evidence to the contrary. Just as a quick addendum: The utterly stupefying fact that there are supposedly competent adults that look at trump and, despite all evidence to the contrary, see him as strong and successful, urges one to try to determine just how deeply their brains must be broken to ignore all the facts give the polar opposite interpretation of trump as they end up at. The fact that they are so utterly misguided in their percpetions tells you just how badly they must be injured deep down. Sorry, I'm kind of trailing off because I really need to get some work done, but I'm glad you asked me to elaborate. Hope you found it of some benefit.</TEXT>

I'm simply saying that - even given that it was an off-the-cuff putdown that he generated spontaneously, which professional comedians do all the time - that it was incredibly weak because it has no basis in reality (for a putdown to be effective, it has to have some relationship to reality) and isn't really even that devastating. OK, Philly has less bridges than NYC... OK, so?... Alright, everyone. Time to let it go. You don't need to defend Bill any more. It was a weak, nonsensical, and corny putdown.

And it's vegan, so most anyone can eat it. I'd strongly recommend trying it out. If you have a health food it whole foods nearby, they'll almost certainly have it, and it might be in bulk, so you try just a small amount. I've mostly used it as a cheese alternative (popcorn, faux cheese sauce, etc) but it's good as a condiment or dressing on lots of foods, e.g., french fries, salads, etc.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I'm not exactly pleased with Biden, as I'm a staunch progressive and wanted Bernie, but you're just parroting trump talking points here. Biden did fairly well while the drunken gorilla repeatedly flung shit at him the entire time. It's disengenuous to say he did poorly when no one knows how hard it is to formulate complex thoughts while having a belligerent asshole shout at you repeatedly. I've taught high school in North Philly, so I have a slight inkling, but those kids were considerably more considerate than that jackass was.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I hear ya, but you need to find time for self-care whenever and wherever you can. I teach in an urban school for foster kids, tutor online for test prep, get my two young daughters most weekends, and recently adopted a puppy. In sum, I'm spread pretty thin. But nonetheless, I take walks (for the pup and myself), do yoga, meditate, and journal when I can (none of them consistently), as well do my best to eat and sleep well. I'm in my mid-40s and haven't EVER prioritized myself like this. It's made me feel so much better about so many things, but especially my anxiety levels and my ability to deal with stressful events. Point being: just do as much for yourself as you can, whenever you can. It pays dividends.</TEXT>

Are you doing it for yourself or do you actually believe people will read your blatant falsehoods and fall for them? "Fake news", huh? Well, at least you're not trying to hide that you're a cult member of the liar-in-chief. Healthy people *can* die from covid: https://www.yahoo.com/lifestyle/young-healthy-people-die-covid-050050566.html And for the record, there's no such thing as "fake news". There's "news", which is reporting on events that are happening in the world. And there are "lies", which is what trump does everytime he speaks. If you use that term, you've immediately lost all credibility, but you probably don't care about that.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I have severe anxiety which manifests in tightness in my chest and shortness of breath too, and l-theanine doesn't help with it, though it does help me to be calmer and less reactive to stress. The only thing that really helps with the phsyical symptoms have been klonopin and kratom. I used to take the former on an as needed basis, until I discovered kratom. I now take kratom multiple times a day to manage the anxiety, and it's done wonders for me. I used to self-medicate with alcohol to an unhealthy, excessive degree. I almost never drink anymore. I'm also being proactive about my health in a way that I haven't for decades. But a big warning: it can be addictive, so if you consider it, approach it cautiously. There a sub for it and one for quitting it. I read up a lot on both before I even tried it. Some day, I'd like to wean myself from it, but it's had nothing but positive effects on my life, and I don't have addiction type urges for it at all. I take it 3x/day normally, and when my stress is greater, I take another dose or two. I get no high from it, nor does it mess with my cognition. It just relieves me of the otherwise debilitating effects of the anxiety. I'd recommend researching it.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I'm kind of opposed to SSRIs (wellbutrin) and benzos (klonopin), but some would argue that kratom is just as problematic. It can cause a lot of problems when trying to quit, but I'll cross that bridge when I come to it. My anxiety comes from Complex PTSD, due to childhood trauma, as well as some early adulthood trauma that was the straw that broke me - both of which I'm working on in therapy. I'd love to get those issues totally solved and then not need the kratom, eventually, but for the time being, I have no qualms with taking it on a regular basis. I also have chronic backpain (possibly caused by the PTSD), and it helps with pain relief too. My soul hasn't felt so at peace in over two decades, and that's through separation from my wife and a freaking pandemic, while teaching foster kids in the innercity. It's really worked wonders for me.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I used to feel the same way, but I ahve all of the symptoms of Complex PTSD, therefore my trauma was bad enough. Just because it doesn't fit the horror stories you've seen in movies or even read in the news, doesn't mean that it's not valid. If you have the symptoms, then it was bad enough. Don't feel bad because your trauma wasn't as bad as some others. Accept it for what it is, and proactively work to address it. I'm 47 and it took my years to accept that I ahve PTSD, because I thought it was only for people that fought in Nam or something. Made me feel like a pu$$y for a long time, but then I decided to accept it after reading The Body Keeps the Score and realizing the book perfectly describes my condition. I'm now working to minimize the effects of the trauma without feeling bad about having a different type of trauma.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>C'mon, it's ok that you didn't know that it was the generic name. I hear you on the addiction front, and I don't like that about it, but though I depend on it to manage my anxiety symptoms, I don't feel addicted to it. I'd say that coffee is a stronger addiction to me. In fact, it's in the same family as coffee. And you just consume the leaf of the plant. For me, it's the difference between being debilitated with anxiety, taking an SSRI or benzos, or eating a leaf a few times a day, I'll take the later, easily. It's not illegal in most states, and definitely doesn't show up on drug tests. I'm starting to feel like a pusher, so I'm going to let it go. I just know that if you're anxiety is anything like mine, it's terrifying and nearly impossible to live with. I used alcohol, one of the most destructive drugs around, to cope for all too long. I was so grateful when I discovered kratom. I'll leave it at that, because now I'm being redundant :-D</TEXT>

Took me a long time (I'm now 47) to realize how traumatized I ws by my brothers treatment and the inability of my parents to protect me or even provide me the emotional tools to cope with the abuse - or any other life challenge. I've long through of myself as "emotionally retarded" (sorry for the r-word, I know I shouldn't use it, and don't anymore.) I've been angry with my parents for all this, but two things: (1) the anger doesn't do any good, no matter how much it's "justified", and (2) my parents had shit lives growing up.

I'm not saying that as a knock on kratom, because I'm very pro-kratom. I began using it to break the chains of an alcohol addiction, for which its worked wonders, and it is essential in management of my anxiety and chronic back pain. So don't think I'm trying to denounce it, but the honest fact is that it's an addictive substance.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Pete Walker's masterpiece "Complex PTSD" might help you out, then. I've come to realize that my anxiety is derived from childhood trauma and CPTSD. He discusses the predominance of the inner critic and outter critic in that book. It's been very helpful for me to realize how much I'm judgemental of others, and always fearful of being judged. Even silly shit I don't really care about at all, like fashion (I'm not a very fashionable person whatsoever, but find myself judging others for their outfits) I'm actively working to catch myself in my incessant judging and replace it with explicit thoughts of "to each their own" or compassion, or whatever's appropriate.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Bear in mind: Everybody's needs are different. I'm a middle-aged guy that learned of kratom less than a year ago, through a post of breaking the addiction to alcohol. That has been my struggle for the past 20 freaking years, which coincides with the development of debilitating anxiety. After researching it for a while, I finally took the plunge, but I was dosing very small amounts, infrequently, due to the fear-mongering. After not seeing the cravings reduced significantly, I made a post seeking help from people that had used it for the same purpose, and it was suggested that I'd probably need to take significantly more in greater frequency, which I began to do. Additionally, I had used klonopin for over a decade to deal with acute anxiety attacks, but I started to find that kratom was much more effective and diminishing the debilitating effects of anxiety. So, for about 9 months now, I've been taking about 4 grams, 4-5 times day. And the effect on my life has been drastic! I'm not to the point that I rarely ever drink, and when I do, I really feel like dookie from it - hence making it less and less appealing. I'm on the cusp of quitting completely. Additionally, I do not need to take any psychiatric meds for the anxiety attacks. If I'm having a particularly rough day, I can take an extra dose and chill. My life has radically improved, despite the fact that I was going through separation from my wife, who moved an hour away with my young daughters who I'm very close with, coping with chronic backpain, addressing issues with out-of-control rage attacks, while facing a pandemic, teaching in an urban school for foster children, and tutoring in test prep on the side. Yet I have not felt better in my entire adult life! I've gradually improved every aspect of my life, but especially my psycho-emotional state. I'm in considerably greater control of my emotions and my actions. I handle stress with aplomb where I'd typically have a melt-down. And I can attribute all of my success to the discovery of kratom. Now, it wasn't the plant alone, of course. I've worked hard to address my personal issues: psychotherapy, meditation, yoga, journaling, got a puppy, take lots of long walks, eat and sleep much better. But kratom gave me the space to do all those things in ways I wasn't able to prior to discovering it. I had been working on each of those for years, but wasn't able to engage with them enough to really make a dent in my condition. I'm now far alogn the path to recovery. I've never "chased the dragon", because I've never gotten a high from it. I take just enough to stabilize myself. I think about my consumption a lot and always think "less is more" when I measure out my dose (knocked a gram or so off the spoon before the ole T amp;W this morning, in fact), but sometimes that's not true for me. I take too little and after an hour or so, I realize I need to reup a touch to get to baseline. I just say all of this as a caveat to all of those people on these threads, as well as others on subs related to mental health and self-improvement who over-apply their own experience or limited understanding. You all need to be very careful with your words or you may very well misinform people who have vastly different life experiences and needs. Thanks for listening, all 3 of you that are likely to make it through all of that, I'll now be stepping down from my soapbox.</TEXT>

Here's what I did: 1) Herbal and vitamin sleep aides: l-theanine, glycine, magnesium, and others (Theanine Serene is a nice complex). 2) Guided meditations before bed: YT has a bunch that help you get in the right mindstate to sleep deeply, unencumbered. 3) Weighted blanket 4) Make a regular routine and adhere to it strictly. Stick to it on the weekends too. 5) Use an alarm app that forces you to get out of bed to turn it off. I use Sleep as Android, and make it so I have to scan a QR code in my bathroom to turn it off. 6) Drink a sizable glass of water right upon waking, and don't get back into your bed. 7) Reward yourself with something enjoyable that makes you feel good about waking early. You need to really commit to it and it will eventually sink in and become habit, though it will be hard at first. Be positive about it. Mindset is key. Think about all of the things it will enable you to do once you set it in motion. I'm able to get self-care activities in before work now, and it makes my day so much better that I'm happy to get to bed in order to enjoy them the next day.</TEXT>

I try to do it everyday (but it's mroe like 2-5/week in practice), and I always enjoy it when I do. So, why don't I do it daily? Because I'm an anxiety ridden spaz who loses focus on what really matters, getting swept up in activities with more *immediate* appeal, such as redditing, of course - which is one of the various reasons that I NEED to meditate more.</TEXT>

I've been reading a lot on it in the past year, and it's improving my life significantly, though through fits and starts. The Body Keeps the Score, as well as Complex PTSD (Pete Walker) are two masterpieces that you can learn a lot from. Highly recommended!</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Bro/sis, stick with it! You're probably just digging out of a deep hole, so you haven't sen the light of day yet, so to speak. It took me a LONG time to really start to see the changes, and now I feel like I'm getting better and better week by week. And it's well worth it. I was/am a complete spaz with deep childhood truama and attention and anger issues, so I had a big deficit to overcome. You might be in a similar boat. Just stick with it. As your interlocutor said, don't get upset with your mind for blathering. The work *IS* just noticing and returning to your breath. What method do you use? Counting to 4 and starting over was a profound step for me. Additionally, be conscious about feeling your body relaxing as you exhale. You can actually keep your mind busy which limits the chatter. Because I have severe anxiety due to CPTSD, I use the mantra "You are safe now" as I inhale, and then count on the exhale. I've also recently been focusing my energy on being a night watchman, so to speak. You're just quietly watching for anyone approaching. If it's a harmful/negative thought-emotion, I think "Send it back"; if it's positive or neutral, I think "let it pass". The idea is that you're just supposed to watch your mind and not get attached the storms raging in there. The most important work is realizing more and more deeply that the "I"/you is/are separate from the thought, beliefs, assumptions, and emotions roiling around in there. The more that you can separate your true self from all of the contents of your mind, the greater peace that you'll achieve internally and the greater rewards that you'll reap.</TEXT>

And no one gave Michigan a chance to win that game. That context is what makes it especially crazy to overcome that deficit. Edit: I just realized my point wasn't probably clear: What I meant was #1 team overall v. the #16 team overall - not 1 seed v. 16 seed. Meaning: coming into the tourney, Kansas was the to ranked team in the country, while Michigan was just inside the top 20. Now I understand all of the strong reactions to my post.</TEXT>

I hope for a perfect season, of course, but I kinda consider it a wash and am more looking to next season. So I'm seeing this one as more about development for next. In that respect, I just wanna see Joe throw clean and make good decisions, more than yearning for big plays. Stable, safe play til he really gets his feet on the ground, keeping interceptions to a bare minimum with a few big throws here and there - until OSU, where hs just rips their heads off. That's wishful thinking with the juggernaut they have. I'd be OK with a loss there, as long as Coach Brown shows that he's learned something and keeps it from being another blowout. Then we go into next season knowing what we have and ready to make a run at the CFP and, potentially, a natty. Asking too much? Naw, we're due.</TEXT>

    <TITLE>Meditation stance: Night watchperson</TITLE>
    <DATE>2020-10-13 22:15:43</DATE>
    <TEXT>During my meditation this morning I was reflecting on the pose to take mentally and emotionally while focusing on my breath and developed the idea of taking the internal stance of a night watchperson. I found it to be very helpful because sometimes it's easy to get lax in meditation and then get swept away in the current of thought and emotion. This stance allowed me to be vigilant, perceiving through all my senses any sign of life about me. And when I did encounter a guest approaching my stronghold, if it was an unwelcome visitor I thought "Send it back", whereas if it was welcome, I thought "Let it pass." It was very empowering, making me feel like the village entrusted me to keep them safe; it allowed my self to be actively attentive without lapsing into laziness; it externalized the thoughts and emotions roiling around inside of me to encourage me to not identify with them. Overall, it made for a very rewarding meditations session. Jsut thought I'd share and see if anyone has any thoughts on this practice. Has anyone tried anything similar before? If so, to what effect? If you so desire, give it a whirl and let me know what you think.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>It's honestly the best thing I've ever done in teaching: * Groups of 3-5 kids (4 is ideal, with a low level, a couple mid, and a high level), ensuring that personalities mesh OK * Each kid needs a mini-white board, marker, and eraser * A question is written on the board (again this is a review game, which I use at the end of a unit, for review before an assessment, typically. Start easy, aiming for 100% success across all groups early on, and work up in difficulty.) * The students have some amount of time to answer it (I just feel it out, maybe giving a 30 seconed warning to speed up the process and forewarn that time is running out). * No student is allowed to write on the other students' boards, but they are encouraged to work together - tell them that's the whole point: to learn from each other. You also have to spend a lot of time helping them to understand how to work in a copoperative group, how to disagree nicely, and what they can and can't say to each other - such as name calling, etc. This piece is absolutely crucial to the success of the entire endeavor. Have kids model ways they should and shouldn't talk to each other. Let them know if they are fighting/being mean to teammates, the whole team is penalized. Also, being jerks to other teams, cheating, etc. are penalties. Paise the hell out of the teams that are having healthym even loud and emotional disagreements within the group as to how to answer it and why, as long as they're not yelling or name calling. It's honestly the most beautiful scene as a teacher when they are passionately debating how to answer a frekaing math question! (Bringing a tear to my eye just thinking about it.) * Rewinding back: Have a football field drawn on the white board with a magnet representing each team. They are all moving the same directions, so it's actually much more like a race, but that doesn't matter - the success for the hard-nosed kids is all in the branding. The field is broken up in 5 yard increments, but I just draw the 10 yard lines, like a real field. Start every team at the 20 yard line, beceause there's penalties. * Random number generator (dice or app) determines the team that gets called on, as well as the individual student that has to answer. They have to hold up their board showing that they did all of the requisite work (not just repeat what the "smart kid" in the group is whispering to them) and they need to EXPLAIN how they arrived at their answer. The randomness is ESSENTIAL because it incentivizes the kids who know the answer to help their teammates not only write down the work, but also be able to explain it. Make that very, VERY clear when you're first explaining how to play. The ENTIRE purpose is for the whole team to work together and come up with the same answer that is presumably correct. If a kid answers quickly and isn't helping those struggling during a question, approach and let them know that they are going to be upset if their teammate gets called on and doesn't get it correct - and it will be on their hands! If they don't, then I intentionally call on that student in the group that didn't have it, just so the other can feel the sting and then want to help next time. * Have a deck of cards, and pull one out if the student answers correctly (if not, reroll and select a different team). A-5 is 5 yeards; 6-10 is 10 yards; Face card is 15 yards. * The team furthest when the time is up wins! I make it so we never score a TD during classtime, but if a team did, you can just start over. You can give a small piece of candy as a prize, but honestly kids want to play and win so badly that it doesn't even matter if you give a prize. I've had a whole classroom of 7th graders in an urban school working dilligently and staying on task while I turn my back to do other things. It's quite a sight to behold.</TEXT>

I've been a miserable failure on occassions in my teaching career (15 years now), but I wish deelply that there were more that took a similar approach to mine. Would really like to be a professional tecaher coach to spread these values and ideals more widely. My kids have such rough lives and the least we can give them is caring teachers that addess their psycho-emotional needs first and foremost.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Yeah, I wouldn't wanna be tasked with enforcing it, but if it cut down significantly just for the threat of a fine and community service, then why not? You don't need perfect application for a law to be put in place, as long as it's cutting back on unnecessary deaths by just limiting the number of people gathering. Like those kids could have a party of 10 people, instead of the 30 crammed into the tiny yard, and the spread would be cut back significantly.</TEXT>

Right-wing talking points is bring up protestests over racial inequalities whenever you perceive that someone might have views different from yours. I didn't address it because it's right-wing talking points to try to shift the conversation to something that you perceive as being hypocritical and completely ignore the point at hand. I'm taking the pandemic as serious as anyone is. I know you think you're being cute by copying my statements, but they were in reference to things that you actually wrote and said whereas you were making assumptions about who I from a complete dearth of information.

    <TEXT>Stopping the spread of a deadly disease by limiting how many people can gather is "insane gov't overreach"? Look, I'm not pro big government, by any means, and I'm very reulectant to grant those in power with any more power. I'm radically opposed to the patriot act and unwarranted spying and such. But this is different. The US has considerably higher death rates than any other country, despite having a fraction of the population of countries like China and India. And why is that? Because those in power didn't take the necessary steps to address it, and one of those could've and, in my mind, should've been limiting the size of social gatherings. Yes, even on private property. I know that everyone views the role of govrnment differently, but to me limiting unnecessary deaths should be the very top on the list. If that means that my party can only have a handful of people for a few months, rather than dozens and dozens, I'm OK with that.</TEXT>

If aliens attacked earth and were threatening mass extinction, would you be OK with governements imposing severe restrictions if it kept the human race in existence? Yes, of course you would. In the scales of personal freedom vs. mass death, I'm all for temporarily limiting some freedoms to keep a deadly virus from spreading and annihilating hundreds of thousands of people (oops, too late.)  gt; so much of the population never wanting to be legally forced to do or refrain from doing anything. The price of society is that you reap the benefits and rights, but you then have some responisbilities. Your personal freedom might have to be somewhat limited at some points in your life in the interest of the greater good. Don't like it: leave society and live off the grid in the middle of nowhere. There you go: freedom.  gt; It makes it so for many politicians even trying poses a big risk to reelection efforts. Some of us - I would say the majority - actually want mature, rational adults leading us, who make tough decisions in order to keep as many of us alive and limit the spread of a deadly disease. Therefore, at least in many parts of the country, the greater risk to reelection is posed by inaction and/or, in the case of the grifter-in-chief and all of his wannabes at the state level, outright disinformation.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I deeply appreciate your compassionate approach. I'm a person in the middle of the cultural divide right now between Boomers and Millenials (Gen X), but I'm much more tech savvy and outside the mainstream (skate punk from back ni the days who always question the status quo), so I'm much more in line with the views of the young bucks. But all this anti-boomer sentiment spread so widely on the internet troubles me, profoundly. I also studied psychology and human development, and have been teaching urban students for over 15 years, and bring a perspective of compassion and understanding. I don't blame them for their conditions, but see them as victims, and work to provide them the tools to overcome their limitations foisted on them by the terrible forces of capitalism. I used to despise the older generation and see them as part of the forces oppressing lower income kids and people of color (which is true, to some degree, often times), but as I've been studying Complex PTSD and working on myself, and thinking about the implications for my students, I'm starting to see these older folks as being victims too. I used to harbor vitriol toward trump supporters, but I'm starting to realize that they were probably vitcims of trauma themselves, which is why the fear mongering is so effective on them. Do I like that people in power use xenophobia to divide the working class? Hell no. Do I like that low income, disempowered white folks cling to xenophobia to address their own fears? Hell, hell no! Should I continue to blame them for their on deep-seated xenophobia?... I don't think it's prudent. And it's definitely not the path forward to healing and reuniting the working people's in our fight against the corporate overlords.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>It sounds like she did a good job, (I didn't watch because I cannot stand to hear him talk), but I still wish journalists would go further with lying politicians. Moreso than anything with the "I don't know" and "I don't recall" answers. Why do they accept that at face value and never follow up with "Isn't it your job to know those things? Aren't you being negligent by not knowing that? We have evidence that you were briefed on that, and it's a dangerous terrorist organization, so shouldn't you be well versed on them? Every educated person in the US knows about QAnon and their conspiracy theories, and it's not their job to keep us safe; since it's your job, shouldn't you know more than the average news consumer?" Etc etc etc. It drives me insane that our journalism has been done so poorly in the era of the the GOP getting more and more brazen with the blatant lies of I don't know/recall BS. We ALL know it's a lie, so FOLLOW UP! That's your job! Jesus, why are you so bad at this, "fourth estate"?!?! Get off your asses and do your jobs. Wish they would listen to british journalists and see how professionals actually do their job professionally. I get more and more disgusted by my own country every year and would love to see een the slightest movement that thoe who are supposed to protect and inform us are not getting steamrolled by lying grifters.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Agreed. The only reason we have trump and his cult is because faux "news" set the groundwork for him. They claim to be news in their name but claim to be entertainment in court cases; this elision of concepts is the entire difference between fantasy and reality, where their followers take fantasy for reality. They are brazen in their misinformation. That alone is not bad enough: it's the fact that the violent acts that their followers engage in is inherent to their langugage. They ARE responsible for the actions that their followers take because they've convineced them of an alrternate reality where violence makes sense in that world. I feel bad for them, TBH. Like the guy who drove to DC due to pizzagate was actually putting his life at risk doing what he thought was the right thing. Is he responsible for hsi actions? Certainly. But is he solely responsible? No. Those that led him to believe that those heinous acts were taking place and the citizens should take action are responsible too. So what is to be done? I'm not certain. Fines for disninformation? Possibly. Legal action against the networks and the figureheads and faces that are disseminating falsehoods and that violent acts are appropriate and called for. Yeah. Certainly. That would stem that problem really quickly. This - ABOVE ALL ELSE - should be a prioity for the left. Because once the working class is undivided, real change can happen. When you have white working class people in Appalachia, for example, who hold up this vile turd in the white house as their savior, then it's going to be an incessant battle between those on the left who actually understand what's going on, and those on the right who are supporting politicians who are actually acting against their personal interests.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I grew up 45 minutes drive from the Pig and me and my skate punk buddies started driving there to see shows in high school. All 3 of those songs came out after I dropped out of college and moved to Ann Arbor (where the Blind Pig is located), during which time I went to a lot of rock shows, some in basement parties and many at the Pig. I was also a diehard Beasties fan from Licensed to Ill days all the way through to the present. So, this commercial really hit my in the feels, especially as a person who was staunchly pro-Bernie and reluctantly pro-Biden. As much as I don't care for how things went through the primary, I feel fairly good about voting for Joe (after uber-reluctantly voting for Hillary in 2016) at this point, in light of the creeping fascism of the trump era. The entire presidency of the grifter-in-chief has been really hard on me, during which time many currents have been weighing heavily on my soul: I've been teaching at an urban school for foster kids, mostly of color, because I'm fervently anti-racism, throughout this time, and seeing the rise of outright racism in the state I grew up, the state I went to grad school, and the state I currently live in - all of which went from trump. Also during this time my marriage has slowly dissolved, seeing my wife move to the next state with my young daughters, whom I'm very, very close with and deeply attached to, and coming to terms with the PTSD I suffer from childhood trauma. And then the pandemic hit, right as I was starting to get my feet on the ground with coping with the loss of my family, trying to heal from my trauma, and seeing what my students are experiencing because the most selfish, conniving, lying piece of garbage completely fucked up the country's response to this once-in-a-century, uttely devastating event - which is multiple times worse than what I'm even going through, making me feel bad for even feeling bad about my conditions and struggle. None of my family lives anywhere close, and all of my friends have moved away, except for my once-friend and colleague, who turns out to be a covid truther, while another friend, who I thought would be there for me through this trying time in my life, has basically ghosted me, despite our families once being very close, with my kids and his once being supertight... Where was I going with this rant?... Fuck, I don't know. I'm super sad. I just walked to the store to buy smokes after quitting drinking (my self-medicating drug of choice for the past two decades) and cigarettes a month ago, because of extreme financial strain. I feel like every time I've started to get a toehold in life, I get a swift kick in the dick, knocking me from the rockface I was frantically grasping onto. That sharp, painful feeling reared its ugly head today after returning my daughters to their mother and coming to an empty home and debilitating financial stress. So, I returned from the store after smoking a cigarette on the way home, feeling as low as could be, and opened reddit expecting more despressing news about how trump and the rich fucks that have screwed all of us working people over for decades, but never moreso than through this tragedy continue theor oturight assault on our dignity and well-being.... Only to discover - what is this? - a glimmer of hope? One of my favorite music groups of my entire life (music is one of the few things that have held me together through these nearly five decades of constantly teetering on the brink of total collapse), who has strictly adhered to their highly admirable anti-consumerist philosophy, to retain their integritiy, unlike so many other bands and musicians, allowing their music to be used by a candidate who's pushing a vision so radically opposed to the current era. Is it a sign? Can we possibly muster the hope that some of us harbored when Obama rose up to present a vision of American society that might start to live up to the promise of the civil rights era? Might we begin to unify as a people, looking past our superficial differences? Might the common, working person have a voice that's heard in the annals of power? Might our economy turn back away from the uber-wealthy to provide the rest of us with a decently stable financial situation where we're not incessantly threatened to drown because we had the audacity to get an education to make a better life for ourselves? Maybe even work in a field where we can make a difference for those that have been shat upon by society in general, and the economy, specifically?... Well, that turned out to be a sham. So, what happened? Working people revolted and instead of choosing another politician who promised nothing but more of the same, was rejected for a candidate so utterly revolting by all indicators available, just because he was not the status quo. And that's how we got here. So, I've been struggling - struggling mightily - with the only alternative option to the current state of utterly soul crushing despair being a candidate in Obama's likeness. Obviously a monumental improvement over his rival, but to what end? More of the same? Well, I have to say, Joe has done and said everything nearly perfectly recently. I feel that slight twinge of promise for a better day, despite my deep misgivings that it could just lead to all of Obama's policy shortcomings: the rich continue to get richer, while all the rest of us continue to get poorer and deeper into debt and potential financial ruin. I keep asking myself, is it prudent to allow myself to regain a modicum of that hope that brought tears to my eyes the night that Obama was first elected? My broken and frigid heart keeps shouting "no" in lieu of the warm yearnings for a better society, a better economy, a better world, and a better life that continue to try to bubble up through the rigid sheets of ice. And just when I need a message of possibility for a better day, I see some of my dearest friends have broken their vow against their music being used commercially or politically in order to back Joe Biden. How might I respond, other than to actually allow that slight twinge of hope to bubble up to the surface? Against all of my misgivings, and all of the aches and pains that were overwhelming my heart and my brain, I feel ever so slightly better at this moment than I did before loading up reddit and beginning to scroll. The message was received and heard. Perhaps there is reason to hope. Perhaps there are better days ahead, my fellow broken and down-trodden Americans. If anyone can convince me of it, Ad Rock and Mike D (RIP MCA!) are two of the most able. Thank you, Beasties, for going against your anti-consumerist values to speak to lifelong, deeply dedicated fans and followers of the sounds that you've so frequently put forth to make us feel better despite all the forces that threaten to drag us under. You saved me one more time from potential complete collapse. My friends, there might just be hope. Fellow citizens, there might be brightness and warmth peeking just over the distant horizon! All my fellow working people across the entire earth, we may just be on the cusp of a better life. I love you all. Now, let's take each other in an empowering embrace and press forward, fighting for the changes that the world needs to get back on track and restart the work of social and racial justice, and a dignified life for all of us that walk the earth, and start working for a better tomorrow for the young folks, like my beloved daughters, and the children all across the planet, and those that will be born from this moment forward. We deserve it. We owe it to ourselves. We owe to all of our friends and family, which includes all of our brothers and sisters across the globe, and we owe it to the vision of a better world tomorrow and beyond. Now, please excuse me while I go and sob a deeply ambivalent sob, and try to convince myself that this hope is not all for naught. Be well and good, my people. Move forward with self-compassion and love for all the members of your global family, and with a fervent push for a life full of love for all people. Edit: lots and lots of typos</TEXT>
