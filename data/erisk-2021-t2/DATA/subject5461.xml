    <TEXT>So I got given a taster of some speed (been off it for like 3 years or so) I took a .1 bomb this morning before work and 2 bombs of around 0.05 each at work. Smoked 2 joints before I went into work to keep me level as I wasn #8217;t sure of the speed was gonna fuck me and make me look like a raging tweaker. Turns out it was relatively strong, felt pretty wired all day. But the thing is, I don #8217;t get wired like i guess others do, it keeps me on a calm level for ages but awake as fuck. I have abused it in the past and stayed awake for like a week and had fits but today it honestly felt like I #8217;d taken calm powder not a CNS. Anyone have insight?</TEXT>

    <TEXT>So background info (I #8217;m new here) I work for ASDA uk in house security guy, new to the job this was like my 8th shift. And I honestly love it! Anyway, tonight was a short shift 5pm till 10pm, I stand at the front of the store behind a podium with my CCTV monitor and control and do store patrol (relatively big store) and monitor people as they come and go etc. 19:02pm in walks 2 known junkies with a trolley each, they disappear into the aisles and I try to find them on camera, can #8217;t see them so I take a walk, spot the female in the fresh meat aisle so I walked away to go on the camera (fucking mongy move!), lost again, I #8217;m staring at the monitor and no sign, turns out at 19:11 they walk past my dumb ass engrossed in the cameras with a rucksack full of lamb legs that don #8217;t come with a manufactures tag!! Ffs, this isn #8217;t their first time doing it obviously and we know they are coming back. Next time though, imma catch them fuckers! So yeah, my question is how did/do you guys deal with situations like that? Like any tactics you guys got? Thanks!</TEXT>

    <TEXT>So I been plugging for 10 years never even been sniffed at by LE. Tonight I get texts from a friend who lives near where I do my thing in the woods, turns out a guy down there who seen me do a few bits in the past and followed me a couple of time but never actually seen anything clear as day has grassed me into the pigs. Obviously I #8217;m gonna close up shop and lay low (T break too sadly), but I got a family here so don #8217;t want authorities to intervene in any way, my question to anyone out there who #8217;s been in my situation, how the fuck do I make sure I #8217;m squeaky clean in case I do get raided, besides: Burning my graft phone and sim Destroying scales and baggies And giving back any product to my guys Any input would be appreciated, and I don #8217;t need telling how dumb I am! UPDATE: I #8217;ve got all my shit gone, just waiting for the raid to happen (if it does) haha</TEXT>

    <DATE>2019-08-20 22:48:16</DATE>
    <TEXT>As the title says I got snitched up. So a little update in case anyone cares So far I #8217;m enjoying retirement, 10 years of dealing really does change your thought processes and behaviours. I work in Security and I #8217;ve noticed a lot of the traits I developed as a dealer can be implemented into my job! Like dealing on the street needs an attention to detail (such as cars in the area that don #8217;t belong there), doing my job requires attention to details or I #8217;m in the shit. Punctuality is another, always being on time or earlier to a meet so people ain #8217;t waiting around attracting attention to ya operation, I need to be on time for everything at work, it #8217;s all on a timed basis. Hell its shit having to buy personal pot, I #8217;d love to grow but now my money is sucked up by pot and everything else haha. Who knows, one day I might finally feel comfortable around people without feeling like I nee to complete a transaction and bounce lol! Thanks for reading if you stuck it this far. As a reward, here #8217;s a tip, stay the fuck away from yellow snow.</TEXT>

    <TITLE>First training session</TITLE>
    <DATE>2019-10-03 23:30:09</DATE>
    <TEXT>Hey everyone! Tomorrow night is gonna be my first session at my local MT gym. I #8217;m really looking forward to it. I #8217;m struggling with mental health and have been saying to myself I #8217;m gonna start Muay Thai for months but was just always to busy smoking too much weed. So now I #8217;m 4 weeks sober, no drinking or any drugs and switched to vaping to ditch the cigs. I feel like Muay Thai is gonna help with my issues and stay clean. So anyone got any advice? I know I won #8217;t be sparring, but guessing I #8217;ll be doing some bag work. Also they got gloves that you can borrow, I kinda wanna buy my own, been looking at Venum Elites anyone recommend them? Thanks for reading (if anyone did) EDIT: Fuck that was tough 2.5 hours, learnt the basic punches and kicks, did some light sparring and different drills. I honestly believe it #8217;s something I will do for the rest of my days. I feel like it is the thing I #8217;ve missed my whole life. It hurt, I drenched my T-shirt in the first half hour. But it beats every drug I #8217;ve taken, any drink I could have, and it made me see the cigs aren #8217;t important to me. So onto the vape and gonna start training next week like 2 nights a week at the minimum! I LOVE MUAY THAI!!! thanks for the support guys, I truly believe I can be a much healthier and better person through it!</TEXT>

    <TEXT>So my first session was tonight, absolutely loved it! BUT..... during sparring I couldn #8217;t stop circling my partner, I was obviously wasting too much energy by doing that. Has anybody got some tips on how I can stop doing this? It #8217;s really annoying tbf. Maybe it #8217;s just my ADHD? But I #8217;m seriously wanting to get into Muay Thai, so want to nail sparring. The gym I do does fights and has a fight camp so I really want to get to a level where I can fight in amateur fights. Thanks for reading!  #128591; #127996;</TEXT>

    <TITLE>3 weeks sober</TITLE>
    <DATE>2019-10-08 20:57:40</DATE>
    <TEXT>Hey everyone, new here. So yeah I #8217;m 3 weeks sober, honestly I #8217;m feeling great. So much better than I ever did in the 10 years I smoked. My best advice is to switch from grass to Hash. I could never just quit smoking grass, it was mind blowing how addicted I was, but the hash was so easy. I bought 3.5g and stretched it a week smoking 2 joints a night. Then on the last night, I drank beer and smoked and puked up. Now it #8217;s the last memory of it, not pleasant and I honestly say it worked! Pot really did bring out the worst in me, now I #8217;m happy, engaging with Mental Health services to look at the underlying issues that I buried with pot. Oh and I started Muay Thai, which gives me more happiness than pot ever did. Thank you and Good luck people! You are strong!!!</TEXT>

    <TEXT>So I #8217;m nearly a month in! It #8217;s been pretty easy for me if I #8217;m honest! Maybe it #8217;s been due to a lot of shit in my life going on so been very distracted. But I also truly believe that it #8217;s because I found a hobby to throw myself at! For me it #8217;s Muay Thai, and believe me it works haha. Anyway, this post is just to say a few things: Keep going, don #8217;t look back cos failure is not an option!! Fight your way through it, it gets easier after the second week! Love who you are, you are stronger than you know. Embrace the future and let go of the past. And finally stay away from certain triggers for the first weeks cos they will drag you back (this includes friends who smoke I #8217;m afraid guys!) Good luck to you all! Strength is the power of the mind!</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Sooo went to my second session tonight. Fuck me im dead! It turned out the lesson was aimed at the fighters, haha I realised when my coach came and asked how I was doing, she told me that she was happy that I was keeping up (think she was just being supportive). The bigger guy I was paired up with was super nice and gave me lots of tips, but I felt like I was slowing him down a lot. Nevertheless it was a good 2hours. Back to it Wednesday and then rest till next Monday. I #8217;m gonna be crippled tomorrow and iv got work, good thing I just do boring Security lol.</TEXT>

    <DATE>2019-10-22 18:29:59</DATE>
    <TEXT>So I work at Asda (UK) and I #8217;m classified as Security not LP, today I get a call on the work phone about 2 lads down the Spirits aisle, concealing shit in a bag. Get them on camera and watch as they walk straight through self checkouts past our (useless) staff. Now due to policy I #8217;m not able to stop people on my own, I need a manager present. Nah fuck that, the manager on the phone was taking too long to waddle down. So I stand up from my CCTV podium and start the stop:  #8220;Alright lads, turn around and go pay for your stuff. Now! #8221; The losers look at me and try the old  #8220;we #8217;ve already paid, the machine didn #8217;t give us a receipt #8221; Me:  #8220;nah lads, I #8217;m not stupid go back and pay, and the bottles of vodka in your bag #8221; Management arrived and quickly take the one who stayed the other decided to stand outside and stare at us. Now normally I #8217;d be happy we got one, but the way the other loser kept smiling and winking at me I went out after him. He had a bacon butty and some trousers stashed away. I grab the items off him and tell him to leave the area and he #8217;s banned. Back in the store, the managers are pulling out the hot food and vodka and a box of eggs (Wtaf?) from this guy #8217;s bag. He starts to lose his edge by this point and is blaming his mate (fucking pussy)! We take him back in the office and wait for the police, 10 minutes later a cop shows up, I #8217;m sat at the monitors looking for the evidence, meanwhile the cunt is blabbing on and on about how he didn #8217;t do it, the cop is telling him to shut up, I #8217;m even telling him to shut up! His voice is giving me a headache by now. Quick search reveals he has a knife in his bag. He obviously  #8220;doesn #8217;t know how it got there #8221; gets nicked for theft and a knife. And me, well I #8217;ve had the pleasure of paperwork and burning video onto disks. Was a good day for us, but sometimes I prefer the slow days. Perk of the day is the 2 female officers coming to get footage for another case, that #8217;s always a pleasure haha. Thanks for reading people! Be safe out there, people are fucking stupid!!</TEXT>

    <TITLE>Muay Thai appreciation.</TITLE>
    <DATE>2019-11-01 21:33:25</DATE>
    <TEXT>Honestly guys, I am so thankful I found Muay Thai. I was in a super dark place before I started, was depressed and anxiety ridden. 10 years of drug abuse and all I had to show for my life was a relationship going to shit, two unhappy kids at home. I #8217;m 23, a bit out of shape. Been homeless from 16 to 20, but the fight in me got me through it, the same fight that makes me go back to class every week, makes me stand back up after a sweeping and keeps me rolling with the punches. Muay Thai has changed my thought process and outlook completely, before I was a angry cunt who couldn #8217;t handle my emotions. Now just a month in, I can handle my shit, I don #8217;t feel like I #8217;m gonna explode. I know I #8217;m still a newbie but I #8217;m determined to be the best I can be. To be the best father and partner, to be the best I can be in training. It #8217;s like I #8217;m finally complete, there was something missing in my life. I #8217;m sorry if I #8217;m a boring cunt haha, I just don #8217;t have anyone to say these things to who would actually understand! If you read this then have a good day/night and keep training people! Mental health is no joke but exercise really is the way forward for a lot of issues. EDIT: thank you guys for the encouragement, advice! It #8217;s greatly appreciated truly! I didn #8217;t expect this to get any notice so thank you all!!</TEXT>

    <DATE>2019-11-23 21:49:34</DATE>
    <TEXT>So.... I #8217;m gonna buy a heavy bag start of next year and I can #8217;t hang it from a wall bracket. I would get a [free standing bag](https://www.amazon.co.uk/BodyRip-Standing-Punching-Absorbing-Kickboxing/dp/B07T9KQ5H8?psc=1 amp;SubscriptionId=AKIAILSHYYTFIVPWUY6Q amp;tag=duckduckgo-iphone-uk-21 amp;linkCode=xm2 amp;camp=2025 amp;creative=165953 amp;creativeASIN=B07T9KQ5H8) but I don #8217;t think it would work as well as a usual one. Now in my garage it #8217;s made of breeze block and on both walls there is a singular extra layer of block work that comes out but stops just below the A frame. I think I could put a scaffolding pole running from one side to the other, jam it in place and hang the bag from it so it #8217;s in the middle of the garage. My options are the free standing bag up there ^^ Or the scaffold pole idea. Any input would be greatly appreciated! Thanks!</TEXT>

Best experience was with a older Japanese couple, me and my mate were sitting on a bench smoking some pot chatting shit and they approached us, start miming camera signs at us and we nodded. The guy legit came and sat in between us put his arms around the pair of us (2 dudes who looked pretty stoned and homeless) and his wife took our picture!

    <TEXT>Honestly I #8217;m unsure what that tool even is! I seen a video from Wonderboy who said that lightly tapping your shins with a stick or wooden spoon whilst you watch TV is a viable option. Again I think it #8217;s similar to rubbing your shins with a rolling pin, a very bad idea. Personally when I #8217;m at work I lightly kick a rubbish bin that is made of plastic and pretty light weight [like this](https://www.poolfurnituresupply.com/content/images/thumbs/0001315_30-gallon-pool-deck-trash-can-round-plastic-18-lbs.jpeg). I only do that for 5 minutes and definitely only at like 10% power just to work on form outside of training tbh</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Lose fat, get more confident with aggressive situations. Before I started I had thin arms and a fat belly, now I got some gains going on my arms, my belly going down too. Mentally I used to be very depressed and angry, now I #8217;m generally a happy guy, my anger is under control. Muay Thai is a great art, it teaches you self control, to look at situations critically and act in a logical but fast manner. I #8217;m ever grateful for it, just regret the fact I started this year and not when I was a kid like 10 years ago.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>So I just bought it today, had never heard of it but thought it looks cool and all reviews were like 9/10. Now I #8217;m not a huge gamer, I only really play open world sandbox games like Skyrim and GTA. So in relation to Skyrim, how open is this game?</TEXT>

    <TITLE>PSA: A scam going around targeting elderly people.</TITLE>
    <DATE>2020-02-01 12:56:00</DATE>
    <TEXT>If this doesn #8217;t belong here then please remove it but I want people to see it. I work at Asda and yesterday a elderly man came in to buy  #163;700 worth of vouchers, he had been in the previous day and bought  #163;500 worth. It turns out he had been phoned up by someone claiming to be from A competition (or something similar) and was told he was due some money, but he had to pay a refundable fee upfront to get the money. He was told to buy  #163;500 worth of vouchers to get the money. He was sold them by a colleague after telling her it was for a wedding (she believed him, this is what he was told to say). He then came back the next day and tried to get  #163;700 but luckily management stopped it from happening and questioned him further and it all came out. Sadly the man is  #163;500 out of pocket and there #8217;s nothing he can do. So please if you work in retail look out for this, if you have elderly relatives tell them about this. Again if it doesn #8217;t belong here then feel free to remove it.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Seventh Son. Based on a fantastic series by Joseph Delaney  #8220;The Wardstone Chronicles #8221;. A truly great story for anyone that wishes to read it. But the movie was a complete shit show that basically took the names of the characters and seriously shit all over the story. I was furious at it. I could of made a better movie. The whole series could of been made into a series of great movies if someone with half a brain cell had been involved in the production.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Yeah honestly I have made a few purchases online, but my background is in street dealing so has always been my goto method to score what I need.

Though I #8217;m hearing since I stopped and a few others stopped my area has been dry af so the old ideas are starting to turn my mind #8217;s gears again.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Yeah bro, I nearly got stung one time, sitting around in a nature park waiting for the burner phone to ring smoking a j. Dude comes up in his 40s, wearing cargos, and a waterproof jacket zipped right up. Asks where he can score, I looked at him and had this weird feeling something wasn #8217;t right. Told him I don #8217;t know, I found the half a joint on the ground and thought it was a cig, can #8217;t taste any difference cos I got no sense of taste. He obviously didn #8217;t believe me but at the time I was homeless and looked very much homeless, so guess he didn #8217;t wanna waste time on what he wrongly assumed was a homeless pothead. Jokes on him I was holding at least 3 oz bagged up in various deals and had a few hundred quid. Daft cunt. But after that I moved away from street dealing, went and got a flat to live in and started getting runners to move my food for me.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Hahaha oh dear me. YoU #8217;rE A PoSeR! Lol. I #8217;m not gonna sink to the level of arguing with a random dude on the internet, it #8217;s kinda boring. I sold a lot of shit, every thing from weed to brown but I was smart to know when I was in the red. It #8217;s not hard to not get caught. I wasn #8217;t a fuckin kingpin importing tonnes of weed from Spain, I was just a mid level supplier. Never lived beyond my means and didn #8217;t flash cash like a retard. No sports cars or other luxuries. I #8217;m happy you realise how stupid you must of been. And also I #8217;ll add this, in a town with a very small police force it #8217;s very easy to get away with certain activities. I know people who been in the game for 10 years now and the police ain #8217;t even looked their way. It #8217;s the younger generation who get caught cos they find themselves with a lot of easy cash and start spending it fast on big luxury items when they either still live at home or have no job and live on the  #163;57 a week JSA claim. Plus them Adidas manbags are a dead giveaway! Enjoy your trolling, you ain #8217;t gonna get a rise from me lol I just think it #8217;s funny. The big time MD dealer fresh outta jail.

    <TEXT>I work in a supermarket and I #8217;ve had it all this past week, abusive cunts and people just trying to get by. The front end staff have had to call me over for many situations where security are the only thing some dumb cunt is gonna listen too. I had to shut the store at 10 am last night cos our store is 24 hr and the people are coming in at 3am to stockpile things as the night staff are trying to put it out. They can #8217;t even wait till its on the shelf. So to make sure we can actually get it out and have stock for the day ASDA is shitting at 10pm till 6am. Edit: Shut not Shit hahah ffs</TEXT>

Thank you mate, I #8217;m just taking codeine for my back but they don #8217;t really touch the sides unless I double dose. Plus I #8217;ll hit my vape and I #8217;m slightly high afterwards.

    <TEXT>My first short story. This is my first post here but I #8217;m rather proud of myself, and I have nobody to really tell, I #8217;ve just finished my first real short story. By hand in my good notebook with a fountain pen, my hand is cramping. It #8217;s taken 4 days in total, but it #8217;s finally down. It #8217;s the first time I #8217;ve felt a duty to write the story of a fictional character. It #8217;s a great feeling to know I have completed the sad sorry story of Brian. I just need to type it out when I get a laptop and I #8217;m thinking of compiling 12 more stories of a similar nature and trying to get them published as a collection. The overall theme is the descent into madness in a individual. So yeah, 12 more stories of insanity and the bizarre and I #8217;m done!</TEXT>

    <TEXT>No CWE for Codeine Phosphate bro, just eat them. Though it #8217;s worth noting that your body can only process 300mg at a time, after that it #8217;s a waste. It metabolises into morphine in the liver. So I would suggest you take 50mg 3 times over a hour or 2. Worst that will happen is you will nod out, try 100mg and smoke a cig or vape. Nicotine potentiates opiates/opioids.</TEXT>

    <TITLE>The Static</TITLE>
    <DATE>2020-04-12 09:19:33</DATE>
    <TEXT>The following story was found transcribed on a few tattered pieces of paper found in downtown Allerhurst, NE. As a town full of mystery and surprise, these notes can be taken as facts: The buzzing white noise assaulted my ears, for the 5th time that day my radio had tuned into a new channel and picked up static. I sighed as I fiddled with the dial trying to find the rock station once again,  #8220;And that was Eric Clapton with  #8220;Cocaine #8221; dear listeners #8221; a voice dripped in false cheer and cheesy tones came through the airwaves out my speaker. I sat back down and waited for the next song, in the day of internet and the such we really don #8217;t appreciate the surprise and delight of our favourite song coming on the radio. As I sat spaced out from my last bong hit, I gazed out the window at the grass below and watched the neighbours from down the road mowing the lawns, the radio announced it would be playing Hendrix next. I sat up straight as if to show my full attention was aimed at the radio and waited for the opening squealing of guitar notes to kick in, but they never came. Instead the infernal static returned!  #8220;Fuck you #8221; I exclaimed to the radio, as if it was a living thing capable of understanding my annoyance. I fiddled with the dial once again. Nothing! No station would tune! Damn it. I flicked a switch and turned it off, looking around I found a old book, so settled down and began to read. After 5 minutes I felt the temptation of another bong hit, packed the bowl and lit it up, better. I sat once more with the book, but now my eyes were feeling heavy, that bong had hit me harder than I expected. Before long I was asleep, dreaming of Doritos and cakes. I was rudely awakened by a loud demonic sound of static, it was deafening. I jumped at the radio and switched the volume down, strange...... I turned it off I was sure of it! Nope must of been wrong. Just as I was waking up properly, I glanced around for my water bottle, I heard a different sound. It was still static, but varying pitches and tones of static. I turned the volume dial up a little, yes, there was a new sound within the static. At first it was small increments of pitch changing in some unknown sequence, but slowly it morphed into a more distinctive, human sound, compiled of low guttural noises that followed a rhythmic flow. Hours had passed by and the new signal had come and gone at least 10 times. Each time it was stronger and clearer than the last, it was definitely some form of chanting or shouting. I couldn #8217;t make out the words, for they seemed to be alien to my ears, but I could almost sense the emotion of them. The hastened, almost panic riddled chants oozed a desolate vibe that gripped my soul and held me transfixed. Darkness had formed in my room but I couldn #8217;t bring myself to move, I was hooked into the new sounds of my radio. I glanced at the clock to see midnight was nearly upon me, but I didn #8217;t feel the least bit tired, the chanting had fed my body a energy unlike any other. A new sound caught my attention, a new voice in the static, it was chanting also but it was painful to hear the panicked new voice almost screaming through the static. It was the polar opposite of the low guttural growls of the first voice. It grew more and more pained, it seemed that the physical body of it was in a pit of fire and the noise it gave was the last earthly tones it could make. I began to feel the anxiety build inside myself, my blood was pumping fast yet it was a icy river in my veins. The noises began to distort and twist the airwaves, screeching for help and also the unknown deity that this was all for. I sat back covering my ears, rocking, I myself screeching in unison with the voices of the static. It grew louder and louder, piercing my ear drums with bloodcurdling screams and growl that would awaken Satan himself. I felt wet on my face, looking down I could see blood dripping on my shirt. I began to writhe in pain, each static tone cutting into my brain, my vision was going blurry and my heart was beating hard enough to burst out my chest. I heard a noise, looking to my doorway I saw a black silhouette, it began to walk towards me. And then, nothing, I blacked out. I woke up in a new place, a new room. I didn #8217;t see anything other than a old radio on the table. Some paper and a pencil, on which I have recorded my ordeal I hope that my story can be told, maybe I can even be rescued from this hell hole. Hopefully I will find a way out. But hope is marginal, for I haven #8217;t eaten or drank since I got here. I haven #8217;t even met my captors. If you see a missing poster for Lorne Taylor then please remember I was taken by the Static!</TEXT>

    <DATE>2020-04-14 21:21:01</DATE>
    <TEXT>He stood alone. A dark silhouette against the street lights, an unmoving centurion of the night. Ever since my first night in this apartment, he had been waiting. Two weeks ago my life was a mess, a bad break up with good woman had left me disheveled in both appearance and at heart. But growing up I had had the mantra  #8220;Boys are tough, keep fighting #8221; beaten into me by a variety of relatives. I quickly found a small apartment in the local newspaper, a charming 1 bedroom abode with oak beams running the ceiling #8217;s length and a black iron wood stove to warm me in the deepest of winters. I counted myself lucky on many levels for finding this place, any longer sofa surfing would of lead me to a soup kitchen eventually. Above all else the location was perfect on the west side of Allerhurst, close to my job at the steelworks. I had finished unpacking and felt I had earned some kind of special treat, so called for a pizza takeout. As I waited for my food I busied myself with fiddling around the place, adding the final touches to my new home. I remember now in retrospect, the feeling of being watched, at the time I merely shrugged the feeling off as paranoia in a new place. I looked out the window down onto the car park, my impatience matched my hunger, and I noticed him. A man, I presumed, stood under the branches of a large evergreen, it #8217;s lowest branches grew out long and full. I couldn #8217;t make out his features or even the colour of his clothing, but he installed a feeling of dread in me. I thought to myself he must just be a dog walker or something, trying hard to rationalise his very existence, alas I could not. I could feel his unseen eyes, boring into my own, the dread was rising in me fast. I moved away from the window, closing the blinds in a panic. Sitting on the sofa my thoughts raced through scenes of horror movies, I mean this is how they all start. Slowly my logical mind broke through the turbulence of fear and paranoid thoughts, he #8217;s probably just someone enjoying the nice night, a stargazer of sorts, I tried hard to believe my own words but my gut feeling said otherwise. A sudden banging drew me from my thoughtful abyss,  #8220;shit #8221; I cried aloud. Standing up my knees began to knock slightly, edging my way forward to the door.  #8220;Pizza guy! #8221; Came a voice from the other side of the wooden door, in all my fear and panic I had forgot about the pizza!  #8220;One moment! #8221; I shouted, fumbling around for a 20 to pay. I wrenched open the door and before me stood a young man of around 20, his black jacket and cap bore the pizzeria logo, in his hands a large red pizza box. I smiled at him, almost too happy to see him; he must of thought I was stoned. I handed the money over and was about to close the door when a question came out my mouth involuntarily,  #8220;Hey did you happen to see anybody stood outside? #8221; I quizzed the lad.  #8220;Ummm no? #8221; He replied with a look of uncertainty  #8220;I mean, not that I noticed anyway #8221;. He looked at me oddly as I sighed in relief,  #8220;yeah cool, I just thought... uh never mind, have a good night! #8221;. I decided against spouting off on a delirious rant about a man in the dark, it would most likely end in a trip to a padded cell in Allerhurst Institute for the Insane. I closed the door, locked it and made sure the deadbolt was in place. I now turned my attention to the 14 #8221; pepperoni pizza, I found the tv remote and turned it on. News, soap operas, a film about a bald man shooting people, all flicked past my eyes with each button press. I settled on watching the cartoons, I needed the colours and childish humour to bring me back from my dark thoughts of the night. 11pm came around and I began to feel tired, the pizza had given me that sleepy haze often induced by large meals. Turning off the lights I grabbed a blanket and settled onto the sofa, my bed had yet to arrive and the sofa was looking more comfortable than the cold floor in my bedroom. I turned the TV down and found myself enjoying the crappy reality show on it. Under my blanket I began to get hot because the room was stuffy. I can never sleep in a warm room even as a child I always had my window wide open. I slouched off the sofa and half crawled to the window, pulled up the blinds and unlatched my window. I sat for a moment and breathed in the cold crisp air of the night, it was refreshing to feel the gentle breeze on my face. I closed my eyes to appreciate the moment, nothing beats that feeling when you are too hot to then feel a cold breeze dancing around you. As I opened my eyes I happened to glance down at the evergreen, my heart lurched in my chest, he was there. Still there. The man. He was stood in the exact position from hours ago! He looked as if he hadn #8217;t moved. The pure terror from before resurfaced violently, like a shark coming from the depths to attack a swimmer. I shrunk away from the window, I could not rationally explain why I was so scared, he had done nothing in the way to threaten me, in fact he had done nothing. Maybe it was the primordial fear of the unknown, passed down the generations in the architecture of our DNA. Yes, I thought, it was the unknown aspect of the situation that gave the fear. Maybe the influence of pop culture horror too. Finding my courage I stood back up to face the unknown watcher, but he was gone. The place the silhouette had haunted now lay bare, he must of finished stargazing or whatever reason he had to be there. Retreating to the sofa I pulled the blankets up higher than normal, like a child haunted by the scary stories told by mischievous family members. I resolved to get some sleep, I had a busy day ahead of me. As I lay there I began a mental checklist of jobs for the next day, I was back at work in a day so it was important I sorted what needed to be sorted. As hard as I tried, the man kept perforating my subconscious mind, faceless and evil he followed me to my dreams. The next day a storm had blown in from the north, it #8217;s cold grip held Allerhurst tightly. I awoke early from a disturbed sleep, feeling uneasy with the previous night #8217;s happenings. I switched on the coffee pot, and took a shower. Coffee in hand I sat down, writing out my job list on some paper. First stop was a hardware store, then onto a grocery store, then the cemetery. It was coming upto the 15th of May, the anniversary of my mother #8217;s death. Though my childhood had been swathed in abuse from some relatives, my mother had always been kind to me. She had raised me the best she could, and tried to protect me from my father #8217;s drunken abuse. Often she herself had been the receiver of such violence that I, on more times than I care to remember, believed her dead. She had been a beautiful soul, and taken from me far too soon. 5 years had passed, the pain had of course gotten easier to carry, but at the beginning it had destroyed my world. At around 10am I found myself looking at the wide selection of tools in the town #8217;s DIY store. I selected a few items, including a rather big wrench. I had no real need for such a monster tool, other than to crack the skull of a hypothetical burglar. I paid and left, heading down river towards the grocers. After eating my greasy pizza the night before I felt I needed some sort of nutritious food. I settled for a pasta salad with chicken and ranch dressing, before going to the counter I grabbed a six pack of ales. I wanted to celebrate moving in, even if it was a one man party. Near the counter I found a rather beautiful bunch of flowers, they reminded me of the ones my mother grew in the garden growing up. The checkout girl was pretty, brown hair hung to her shoulders, deep blue eyes set like jewels on her face. A kind smile greeted me. I smiled back in a dorky, awkward manner. We exchanged pleasantries and I left the store. I looked towards the town square, watching the people of Allerhurst go about their business. I set off at a brisk pace toward the cemetery. Allerhurst cemetery started as a burial ground after the civil war, many soldiers were buried there in mass graves, every so often one was found by a unsuspecting landscaper or gravedigger. Usually it would then be excavated and the inhabitants relocated to a new grave with a cross to honour their efforts and existence. My mother had bought 5 plots when her mother died, after she passed she was put next to grandma. 3 plots remained and every time I came here, they reminded me of my own mortality. One day, I too would lay in the hallowed ground alongside my grandma and mother. I placed the flowers in the sunken vase in front of the tombstone, removing bits of litter and debris from the trees.  #8220;Hello Mom #8221; I spoke softly, as though she was alive at my front door. I sat for a while on the bench next to her grave, and spoke to her picture from my wallet. Though from the outside I must look crazy, this was rather therapeutic for me. I could tell her all the happenings of my life, like I always had done. I had been here 2 weeks ago after my break up with Jen, I had spoken to my mother that time, and when I left I felt better in a small way. By the time I had finished it was getting dark, as I closed the iron gates of the cemetery I looked up at the sky. The shades of pink and red made for a pretty scene, especially stretched over the landscape that surrounds Allerhurst. I made my way back home. The car park came into sight first, then the evergreen. I shuddered at the sight of it. But tonight there was no watcher, or as my mischievous mind put it, no axe murderer. I got to the front door and unlocked it, stepping into my hallway. Jacket hung up and it was definitely time for a coffee. I looked at the new tools I had bought, a shiny hammer with a leather handle, a set of screwdrivers and finally the big wrench. My groceries were stowed in their various homes in the kitchen and I sat down to eat the pasta salad. I turned the TV on and decided on the news tonight, see what #8217;s going on in the world. The usual bait of prejudice for the racially motivated demographic, half stories reported by interns and boring sports commentary. That was a big bust, I mused. Flicking around I found some old detective show and found that more to my liking. Engrossed in the story, I went to take a sip of water to find it empty, cursing my stupidity I got up to refill my glass. As I walked past the window, something caught my eye, by the evergreen. The watcher. My eyes widened and I stood transfixed like a deer caught in the headlights.  #8220;What the fuck #8221; I murmured slowly, my heart was pounding again and I could feel the anxiety building. That was it! I #8217;m not being made to feel scared in my own home, I thought. I #8217;d had enough of that as a kid. I walked to the window and wrenched it open, taking a deep breath I yelled  #8220;oi! You down there, stop standing in the shadows and go away! If you don #8217;t I #8217;ll call the cops! You fucking freak!! #8221; That #8217;ll show him I thought. The stranger didn #8217;t move, nor did he yell back. Instead my ears picked up a low guttering laugh, and as it grew louder my face reddened.  #8220;I told you! Just fuck off!! #8221; I yelled even louder, trying to make my voice some what deeper and more intimidating. The laughter stopped, silence hung in the air where it had been. The watcher made a movement, a step, backwards. And was gone from my sight, I waited in case he reappeared but he didn #8217;t.  #8220;Ha, you got the message then! Creep #8221; I said to myself, the petty triumph over my fear felt like a war had been won. I returned to the sofa and watched the rest of my show. Two weeks later and my apartment was looking like a real adult #8217;s home. I had books on shelves, pictures on walls and even stretched to buying a throw for the sofa. The watcher had been absent from the evergreen for two weeks, but not my dreams. Every night since my ballsy shouting, he had materialised in my subconscious as a malevolent spectre haunting the fringes of reality. This didn #8217;t truly affect me, it made sleeping less enjoyable but not so much that I couldn #8217;t sleep. One Saturday morning I found myself eating breakfast in a cafe, on the old market street of Allerhurst. There were many folks about, eating plenty and drinking coffee. I had all but forgotten about the unwanted watcher for two weeks prior, and there I sat without a car in the world. I got up to go pay, the counter was a big wooden one, various cake and sandwiches on display and a coffee machine stood on the side. The wall behind was covered in a mirror. I caught a glimpse of myself, ugly bastard you, I thought. As I paid I looked back up to my reflection. Over my right should I could see out of the door into the square. Stood in the middle, near a bench, was a man dressed in a black coat and ragged jeans. He caught my attention, because I had his full attention, he stood staring at me. No I thought, he #8217;s at least 100 yards away, I #8217;m in a building he can #8217;t see me. My optimism was completely false. I forced a smile at the cashier and made my exit. Outside I looked around but the man was gone. Literally no where to be seen, maybe he had been a figment of my imagination. I decided to walk down to the library, hoping to find a good book to lose myself in. Back at the apartment I had settled in to a book about the occult, a study of demons and such. The dark lure of magic and demonic entities had always interested me, the stories of ancient mages and medieval witch cults. For my dinner I made a burger and fries micro meal, the extent of my culinary skills. I sat by the window and looked out across Allerhurst at night, the dark trees of the surrounding woodlands swayed in the chilly air, smoke rose up from various houses in the distance. I looked down at the car park, inspecting my black Volvo estate. It was a older model but ran like a dream, good mileage and fuel usage. In my peripheral vision I caught a slight movement to my right, at the evergreen. My eyes darted to focus on the source, nothing. Must of been a rodent of sorts. My eyes picked up movement again. I looked at the ground 5 feet to the right of the tree and seen the expected horror of a black silhouette against the light of the street lamp. The fear in me rose, but so to did the anger. How dare this creep stand there again! I raged as I opened the window,  #8220;I told you the other week, fuck off or the police are getting involved! #8221; The figure made no indication that it heard him. But then suddenly out of the silent darkness came a gnarled voice that seemed to float on its own evil wave.  #8220;No. But I do hope you enjoyed that drink today #8221; it said. I reeled in horror, the man in black had been a real presence outside the cafe. I shrank back from the window, my hand rested on the hammer I bought earlier.  #8220;See you soon #8221; the stranger called out to me, his sinister tone chilled my bones. I slammed the window shut, I cursed my situation as I grabbed my phone. The police were the only option here, a crazy dude stands outside my building all night. I dialled in 911.  #8220;911 what #8217;s your emergency #8221; I took a breathe and said  #8220;police please #8221;. A connecting tone broke through the receiver.  #8220;Police #8221;  #8220;Hello, I have a problem #8221; my voice shook.  #8220;Yes? #8221;  #8220;It would seem I have a fellow staring up at my window every night, just stands in the shadows. I spoke to him once and he laughed. He was even stood outside the cafe I visited the other day! #8221; I sounded frantic even to myself.  #8220;We can send out a notice to officers in your area, call back if the situation escalates #8221; came the confident response of the dispatcher. I thanked him and hung up, I checked the window and seen the man was still there, he was stood looking up at the apartment. I still couldn #8217;t work out his face or any features, he was still the silhouette in the night. Shortly the wave of relief washed over me, blue flashing lights came from the left of me into the car park. I watched in disbelief as they stopped in the car park, got out and flashed a torch around a couple of times and got back in the cruiser. My phone rang, I looked the unknown number and prepared my complaint about the two donut chasers below me.  #8220;Hello? #8221; I shaked as I spoke  #8220;Good Evening #8221; a growl on the other side spoke back.  #8220;Is this a officer from the car park? #8221; I asked  #8220;This is some one from the car park yes, I just need to know what number are you in, sir? #8221; The man said, I was just about to reply when fear struck again. There was no blue light illuminating my wall or windowpanes, before the blue had bled over every reflective surface. I peered out of the window to see there was no longer a police cruiser down on the concrete.  #8220;What do you want? #8221; I demanded, my voice now shaking as much as my hands,  #8220;I know who you really are! #8221; A low guttural laugh rang out my phone, it #8217;s mocking tones crushing my last shred of hope.  #8220;Smart one, well I won #8217;t mess around any more. I am coming. #8221; A mocking voice retorted  #8220;see you soon #8221;. I slammed my phone down, calling 911 I began to frantically explain to the dispatcher what was going on. Half way through my pleading rant the ominous tone cut through the call, the line was dead. I tried again, the tone rang back at me almost sneering at me  #8220;dead, you #8217;re dead, dead #8221;. I slammed the phone down and picked my new hammer up. The handle felt good in my hands, the 19.99 price tag, still attached by a plastic loop, hung on the shaft. I swung it around, if I had to protect myself I would. I walked to the kitchen counter and took a swig from the bottle of scotch, Dutch courage. I sat and waited for eternity, my ears strained to pick up the smallest sound. Some where a neighbour was playing music, the bass made its way to my ears. I pushed it aside and focused deeper into the wall of sound emitted from multiple apartments. A shrill shriek cut through the hum of regular noises, I jumped up and readied myself. Breathing deeply I advanced to the hallway, stomping boots could be heard getting louder by the second. The wind outside had picked up, the droning noise and rustling trees. I was stood near the door when I heard it, a wheezing gravelly breathing. The floor creaked slightly under me, i mouthed a curse at the unwanted creek. The guttural laugh mocked me from beyond the thin wooden door.  #8220;I hear you #8221; said the assailant, the words spoken in a drawn out sadistic fashion.  #8220;You won #8217;t get away from me son, I just need some company #8221; it continued. I shuddered at the word company, sick images of being raped and murdered by some twisted silhouette.  #8220;The police are on the way again #8221; I bluffed  #8220;and I have a gun! #8221;  #8220;A gun? #8221; Called out the voice  #8220;Yeah, a big fucking gun, and if you don #8217;t leave me be..... I #8217;ll blast your head off #8221; my voice faltered as I lied. I heard a metallic click and the voice said  #8220;Like this? #8221; A boom of a gun came from the otherside, I jumped away in fear. Looking back at the door I noticed a few holes around a blast centre. The hole gave me a brief view of a black jacket, it moved slightly to the left. Suddenly I found myself staring at a pair of black eyes, surrounded by scarred skin that stretched and blistered over its skull. His mouth was just visible, it too stretched into a sinister smile.  #8220;Hello #8221; he said. I ran, dived into the lounge, I flung myself into the big cabinet that was used for jackets and bits of crap I had long forgotten. As I shut the door a banging, cracking noise signalled my front door had given way. I held my breath, shaking. My right hand was gripped on something hard, the hammer? No I had dropped that in the hallway after the gunshot. No it felt like the handle of my baseball bat, a relic of a phase I went through; determined to get into a sport to get fitter. Cake and chocolate had seen a end to that before it #8217;d made any difference. I gripped it tight and brought it up to my chest, ready to swing at the man. That #8217;s if he didn #8217;t shoot me. The lounge door slowly opened, interrupting my train of thought, a middle aged man dressed in black, dirty clothing torn in places, walked into the room. He was holding a sawn off shotgun, it looked dirty and old. I pressed my eye to the gap, the man looked around and his cold black eyes settled on my refuge. He moved towards the door, panicking silently I needed a plan. He was by the sofa, 8 feet away, in 10 seconds I would be dead and my anus probably getting filled with psycho-man sperm. 6feet. I had to do something, smash the door open? 4feet. Jump out and hit him with the bat? 2 feet. REACT! I smashed hard on the door, it swung into the man and gun hard. The impact had made his trigger finger slip and the second barrel went off. I had no other choice, I had to kill him. I swung the aluminium plated bat down hard, each swing landed on his upper body, I could heard the thump of each swing. The bat must of made contact with his skull because the sound of skull cracking egged me on harder. A primal scream had filled my head, and the sight of the creep #8217;s blood fed an insatiable appetite to live. The minutes had dragged by during the struggle, I hadn #8217;t stopped until I knew he was dead. A sizeable pool of blood saturated the carpet around him, his mutilated face and head, swollen and bloody. The black eyes stared up at me from the eternal abyss. I dropped to the sofa crying and shaking, shock took me and I felt empty to the world around me. Some time later the police had cordoned my apartment off, CSI investigators combed through the scene for several hours, regular uniforms asked me to recount the twisted tale numerous times, often asking changing questions to possibly catch me out. Finally satisfied they told me they would be in touch. When I was allowed back into my apartment I was shocked to see the blood still soaked into my carpet, the body was long gone to the Examiners office. I decided to call the landlord in the morning, he would have to fit a new carpet. I sat by the window, staring out to space. Lights danced in my line of vision, blurred orbs in the distance. I had gone to the 24hr place a while ago and bought a 6 pack of beer and 20 cigarettes. I hadn #8217;t smoked in 10 years, but if there was ever a good time to smoke now was it. I finished a smoke and opened the window more to flick out the ember, I watched it fall, tumbling in midair. The ember burnt up as it hit the ground and I noticed it landed some few meters from the cursed evergreen. I looked at the top of the tree, swaying in the gentle breeze left over from the winds of earlier. My eyes dropped their gaze down the length of the tree till I reached the bottom. My heart stopped. I ran cold. There he stood, the watcher, the centurion of nightmares. Unchanged, Undead. He stepped forwards into the light of the car park. He stood and stared up at me, transfixed in the window. That slow spreading sinister smile ran from cheek to cheek. I cried aloud and looked about me, there was nothing I could do. He stood for a minute smiling demonically, then turned on his heel and began to meander through the bushes into the darkness where he belongs. 6 weeks passed me by, I lost my job soon after the incident of that night. I was too scared to leave my apartment most days, and when I did I was a mess. I would jump as a door opened or somebody spoke behind me. I even struggled with people smiling, in every smile I could see that same sinister, stretched smile of the stranger. I called the police about him and they gave me all the details of the man on their records, even told me where he had been cremated. But I know their John Doe and my Monster are the same, I just can #8217;t explain how. Most nights he leaves me be, letting me rot and vegetate alone in my misery and paranoia. Some nights he stops by, smiling and watching my paralysis develop as I squirm under his devilish eyes. I know one day he will come back for me, and collect me. Maybe he is death, or the devil. All I know is he is attached to me by a bond stronger than stone. A bond of predator and prey. And there he is again. Smiling. Waiting.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>He stood alone. A dark silhouette against the street lights, an unmoving centurion of the night. Ever since my first night in this apartment, he had been waiting. Two weeks ago my life was a mess, a bad break up with good woman had left me disheveled in both appearance and at heart. But growing up I had had the mantra  #8220;Boys are tough, keep fighting #8221; beaten into me by a variety of relatives. I quickly found a small apartment in the local newspaper, a charming 1 bedroom abode with oak beams running the ceiling #8217;s length and a black iron wood stove to warm me in the deepest of winters. I counted myself lucky on many levels for finding this place, any longer sofa surfing would of lead me to a soup kitchen eventually. Above all else the location was perfect on the west side of Allerhurst, close to my job at the steelworks. I had finished unpacking and felt I had earned some kind of special treat, so called for a pizza takeout. As I waited for my food I busied myself with fiddling around the place, adding the final touches to my new home. I remember now in retrospect, the feeling of being watched, at the time I merely shrugged the feeling off as paranoia in a new place. I looked out the window down onto the car park, my impatience matched my hunger, and I noticed him. A man, I presumed, stood under the branches of a large evergreen, it #8217;s lowest branches grew out long and full. I couldn #8217;t make out his features or even the colour of his clothing, but he installed a feeling of dread in me. I thought to myself he must just be a dog walker or something, trying hard to rationalise his very existence, alas I could not. I could feel his unseen eyes, boring into my own, the dread was rising in me fast. I moved away from the window, closing the blinds in a panic. Sitting on the sofa my thoughts raced through scenes of horror movies, I mean this is how they all start. Slowly my logical mind broke through the turbulence of fear and paranoid thoughts, he #8217;s probably just someone enjoying the nice night, a stargazer of sorts, I tried hard to believe my own words but my gut feeling said otherwise. A sudden banging drew me from my thoughtful abyss,  #8220;shit #8221; I cried aloud. Standing up my knees began to knock slightly, edging my way forward to the door.  #8220;Pizza guy! #8221; Came a voice from the other side of the wooden door, in all my fear and panic I had forgot about the pizza!  #8220;One moment! #8221; I shouted, fumbling around for a 20 to pay. I wrenched open the door and before me stood a young man of around 20, his black jacket and cap bore the pizzeria logo, in his hands a large red pizza box. I smiled at him, almost too happy to see him; he must of thought I was stoned. I handed the money over and was about to close the door when a question came out my mouth involuntarily,  #8220;Hey did you happen to see anybody stood outside? #8221; I quizzed the lad.  #8220;Ummm no? #8221; He replied with a look of uncertainty  #8220;I mean, not that I noticed anyway #8221;. He looked at me oddly as I sighed in relief,  #8220;yeah cool, I just thought... uh never mind, have a good night! #8221;. I decided against spouting off on a delirious rant about a man in the dark, it would most likely end in a trip to a padded cell in Allerhurst Institute for the Insane. I closed the door, locked it and made sure the deadbolt was in place. I now turned my attention to the 14 #8221; pepperoni pizza, I found the tv remote and turned it on. News, soap operas, a film about a bald man shooting people, all flicked past my eyes with each button press. I settled on watching the cartoons, I needed the colours and childish humour to bring me back from my dark thoughts of the night. 11pm came around and I began to feel tired, the pizza had given me that sleepy haze often induced by large meals. Turning off the lights I grabbed a blanket and settled onto the sofa, my bed had yet to arrive and the sofa was looking more comfortable than the cold floor in my bedroom. I turned the TV down and found myself enjoying the crappy reality show on it. Under my blanket I began to get hot because the room was stuffy. I can never sleep in a warm room even as a child I always had my window wide open. I slouched off the sofa and half crawled to the window, pulled up the blinds and unlatched my window. I sat for a moment and breathed in the cold crisp air of the night, it was refreshing to feel the gentle breeze on my face. I closed my eyes to appreciate the moment, nothing beats that feeling when you are too hot to then feel a cold breeze dancing around you. As I opened my eyes I happened to glance down at the evergreen, my heart lurched in my chest, he was there. Still there. The man. He was stood in the exact position from hours ago! He looked as if he hadn #8217;t moved. The pure terror from before resurfaced violently, like a shark coming from the depths to attack a swimmer. I shrunk away from the window, I could not rationally explain why I was so scared, he had done nothing in the way to threaten me, in fact he had done nothing. Maybe it was the primordial fear of the unknown, passed down the generations in the architecture of our DNA. Yes, I thought, it was the unknown aspect of the situation that gave the fear. Maybe the influence of pop culture horror too. Finding my courage I stood back up to face the unknown watcher, but he was gone. The place the silhouette had haunted now lay bare, he must of finished stargazing or whatever reason he had to be there. Retreating to the sofa I pulled the blankets up higher than normal, like a child haunted by the scary stories told by mischievous family members. I resolved to get some sleep, I had a busy day ahead of me. As I lay there I began a mental checklist of jobs for the next day, I was back at work in a day so it was important I sorted what needed to be sorted. As hard as I tried, the man kept perforating my subconscious mind, faceless and evil he followed me to my dreams. The next day a storm had blown in from the north, it #8217;s cold grip held Allerhurst tightly. I awoke early from a disturbed sleep, feeling uneasy with the previous night #8217;s happenings. I switched on the coffee pot, and took a shower. Coffee in hand I sat down, writing out my job list on some paper. First stop was a hardware store, then onto a grocery store, then the cemetery. It was coming upto the 15th of May, the anniversary of my mother #8217;s death. Though my childhood had been swathed in abuse from some relatives, my mother had always been kind to me. She had raised me the best she could, and tried to protect me from my father #8217;s drunken abuse. Often she herself had been the receiver of such violence that I, on more times than I care to remember, believed her dead. She had been a beautiful soul, and taken from me far too soon. 5 years had passed, the pain had of course gotten easier to carry, but at the beginning it had destroyed my world.

The checkout girl was pretty, brown hair hung to her shoulders, deep blue eyes set like jewels on her face. A kind smile greeted me. I smiled back in a dorky, awkward manner. We exchanged pleasantries and I left the store. I looked towards the town square, watching the people of Allerhurst go about their business. I set off at a brisk pace toward the cemetery. Allerhurst cemetery started as a burial ground after the civil war, many soldiers were buried there in mass graves, every so often one was found by a unsuspecting landscaper or gravedigger. Usually it would then be excavated and the inhabitants relocated to a new grave with a cross to honour their efforts and existence. My mother had bought 5 plots when her mother died, after she passed she was put next to grandma. 3 plots remained and every time I came here, they reminded me of my own mortality. One day, I too would lay in the hallowed ground alongside my grandma and mother. I placed the flowers in the sunken vase in front of the tombstone, removing bits of litter and debris from the trees.  #8220;Hello Mom #8221; I spoke softly, as though she was alive at my front door. I sat for a while on the bench next to her grave, and spoke to her picture from my wallet. Though from the outside I must look crazy, this was rather therapeutic for me. I could tell her all the happenings of my life, like I always had done. I had been here 2 weeks ago after my break up with Jen, I had spoken to my mother that time, and when I left I felt better in a small way. By the time I had finished it was getting dark, as I closed the iron gates of the cemetery I looked up at the sky. The shades of pink and red made for a pretty scene, especially stretched over the landscape that surrounds Allerhurst. I made my way back home. The car park came into sight first, then the evergreen. I shuddered at the sight of it. But tonight there was no watcher, or as my mischievous mind put it, no axe murderer. I got to the front door and unlocked it, stepping into my hallway. Jacket hung up and it was definitely time for a coffee. I looked at the new tools I had bought, a shiny hammer with a leather handle, a set of screwdrivers and finally the big wrench. My groceries were stowed in their various homes in the kitchen and I sat down to eat the pasta salad. I turned the TV on and decided on the news tonight, see what #8217;s going on in the world. The usual bait of prejudice for the racially motivated demographic, half stories reported by interns and boring sports commentary. That was a big bust, I mused. Flicking around I found some old detective show and found that more to my liking. Engrossed in the story, I went to take a sip of water to find it empty, cursing my stupidity I got up to refill my glass. As I walked past the window, something caught my eye, by the evergreen. The watcher. My eyes widened and I stood transfixed like a deer caught in the headlights.  #8220;What the fuck #8221; I murmured slowly, my heart was pounding again and I could feel the anxiety building. That was it! I #8217;m not being made to feel scared in my own home, I thought. I #8217;d had enough of that as a kid. I walked to the window and wrenched it open, taking a deep breath I yelled  #8220;oi! You down there, stop standing in the shadows and go away! If you don #8217;t I #8217;ll call the cops! You fucking freak!! #8221; That #8217;ll show him I thought. The stranger didn #8217;t move, nor did he yell back. Instead my ears picked up a low guttering laugh, and as it grew louder my face reddened.  #8220;I told you! Just fuck off!! #8221; I yelled even louder, trying to make my voice some what deeper and more intimidating. The laughter stopped, silence hung in the air where it had been. The watcher made a movement, a step, backwards. And was gone from my sight, I waited in case he reappeared but he didn #8217;t.  #8220;Ha, you got the message then! Creep #8221; I said to myself, the petty triumph over my fear felt like a war had been won. I returned to the sofa and watched the rest of my show. Two weeks later and my apartment was looking like a real adult #8217;s home. I had books on shelves, pictures on walls and even stretched to buying a throw for the sofa. The watcher had been absent from the evergreen for two weeks, but not my dreams. Every night since my ballsy shouting, he had materialised in my subconscious as a malevolent spectre haunting the fringes of reality. This didn #8217;t truly affect me, it made sleeping less enjoyable but not so much that I couldn #8217;t sleep. One Saturday morning I found myself eating breakfast in a cafe, on the old market street of Allerhurst. There were many folks about, eating plenty and drinking coffee. I had all but forgotten about the unwanted watcher for two weeks prior, and there I sat without a car in the world. I got up to go pay, the counter was a big wooden one, various cake and sandwiches on display and a coffee machine stood on the side. The wall behind was covered in a mirror. I caught a glimpse of myself, ugly bastard you, I thought. As I paid I looked back up to my reflection. Over my right should I could see out of the door into the square. Stood in the middle, near a bench, was a man dressed in a black coat and ragged jeans. He caught my attention, because I had his full attention, he stood staring at me. No I thought, he #8217;s at least 100 yards away, I #8217;m in a building he can #8217;t see me. My optimism was completely false. I forced a smile at the cashier and made my exit. Outside I looked around but the man was gone. Literally no where to be seen, maybe he had been a figment of my imagination. I decided to walk down to the library, hoping to find a good book to lose myself in. Back at the apartment I had settled in to a book about the occult, a study of demons and such. The dark lure of magic and demonic entities had always interested me, the stories of ancient mages and medieval witch cults. For my dinner I made a burger and fries micro meal, the extent of my culinary skills. I sat by the window and looked out across Allerhurst at night, the dark trees of the surrounding woodlands swayed in the chilly air, smoke rose up from various houses in the distance. I looked down at the car park, inspecting my black Volvo estate. It was a older model but ran like a dream, good mileage and fuel usage. In my peripheral vision I caught a slight movement to my right, at the evergreen. My eyes darted to focus on the source, nothing. Must of been a rodent of sorts. My eyes picked up movement again. I looked at the ground 5 feet to the right of the tree and seen the expected horror of a black silhouette against the light of the street lamp. The fear in me rose, but so to did the anger. How dare this creep stand there again! I raged as I opened the window,  #8220;I told you the other week, fuck off or the police are getting involved! #8221; The figure made no indication that it heard him. But then suddenly out of the silent darkness came a gnarled voice that seemed to float on its own evil wave.  #8220;No. But I do hope you enjoyed that drink today #8221; it said. I reeled in horror, the man in black had been a real presence outside the cafe. I shrank back from the window, my hand rested on the hammer I bought earlier.  #8220;See you soon #8221; the stranger called out to me, his sinister tone chilled my bones. I slammed the window shut, I cursed my situation as I grabbed my phone. The police were the only option here, a crazy dude stands outside my building all night. I dialled in 911.  #8220;911 what #8217;s your emergency #8221; I took a breathe and said  #8220;police please #8221;. A connecting tone broke through the receiver.  #8220;Police #8221;  #8220;Hello, I have a problem #8221; my voice shook.  #8220;Yes? #8221;  #8220;It would seem I have a fellow staring up at my window every night, just stands in the shadows. I spoke to him once and he laughed. He was even stood outside the cafe I visited the other day! #8221; I sounded frantic even to myself.  #8220;We can send out a notice to officers in your area, call back if the situation escalates #8221; came the confident response of the dispatcher. I thanked him and hung up, I checked the window and seen the man was still there, he was stood looking up at the apartment. I still couldn #8217;t work out his face or any features, he was still the silhouette in the night. Shortly the wave of relief washed over me, blue flashing lights came from the left of me into the car park. I watched in disbelief as they stopped in the car park, got out and flashed a torch around a couple of times and got back in the cruiser. My phone rang, I looked the unknown number and prepared my complaint about the two donut chasers below me.  #8220;Hello? #8221; I shaked as I spoke  #8220;Good Evening #8221; a growl on the other side spoke back.  #8220;Is this a officer from the car park? #8221; I asked  #8220;This is some one from the car park yes, I just need to know what number are you in, sir? #8221; The man said, I was just about to reply when fear struck again. There was no blue light illuminating my wall or windowpanes, before the blue had bled over every reflective surface. I peered out of the window to see there was no longer a police cruiser down on the concrete.  #8220;What do you want? #8221; I demanded, my voice now shaking as much as my hands,  #8220;I know who you really are! #8221; A low guttural laugh rang out my phone, it #8217;s mocking tones crushing my last shred of hope.  #8220;Smart one, well I won #8217;t mess around any more. I am coming. #8221; A mocking voice retorted  #8220;see you soon #8221;. I slammed my phone down, calling 911 I began to frantically explain to the dispatcher what was going on. Half way through my pleading rant the ominous tone cut through the call, the line was dead. I tried again, the tone rang back at me almost sneering at me  #8220;dead, you #8217;re dead, dead #8221;. I slammed the phone down and picked my new hammer up. The handle felt good in my hands, the 19.99 price tag, still attached by a plastic loop, hung on the shaft. I swung it around, if I had to protect myself I would. I walked to the kitchen counter and took a swig from the bottle of scotch, Dutch courage. I sat and waited for eternity, my ears strained to pick up the smallest sound. Some where a neighbour was playing music, the bass made its way to my ears. I pushed it aside and focused deeper into the wall of sound emitted from multiple apartments. A shrill shriek cut through the hum of regular noises, I jumped up and readied myself. Breathing deeply I advanced to the hallway, stomping boots could be heard getting louder by the second. The wind outside had picked up, the droning noise and rustling trees. I was stood near the door when I heard it, a wheezing gravelly breathing. The floor creaked slightly under me, i mouthed a curse at the unwanted creek. The guttural laugh mocked me from beyond the thin wooden door.  #8220;I hear you #8221; said the assailant, the words spoken in a drawn out sadistic fashion.  #8220;You won #8217;t get away from me son, I just need some company #8221; it continued. I shuddered at the word company, sick images of being raped and murdered by some twisted silhouette.  #8220;The police are on the way again #8221; I bluffed  #8220;and I have a gun! #8221;  #8220;A gun? #8221; Called out the voice  #8220;Yeah, a big fucking gun, and if you don #8217;t leave me be..... I #8217;ll blast your head off #8221; my voice faltered as I lied. I heard a metallic click and the voice said  #8220;Like this? #8221; A boom of a gun came from the otherside, I jumped away in fear. Looking back at the door I noticed a few holes around a blast centre. The hole gave me a brief view of a black jacket, it moved slightly to the left. Suddenly I found myself staring at a pair of black eyes, surrounded by scarred skin that stretched and blistered over its skull. His mouth was just visible, it too stretched into a sinister smile.  #8220;Hello #8221; he said. I ran, dived into the lounge, I flung myself into the big cabinet that was used for jackets and bits of crap I had long forgotten. As I shut the door a banging, cracking noise signalled my front door had given way. I held my breath, shaking. My right hand was gripped on something hard, the hammer? No I had dropped that in the hallway after the gunshot. No it felt like the handle of my baseball bat, a relic of a phase I went through; determined to get into a sport to get fitter. Cake and chocolate had seen a end to that before it #8217;d made any difference. I gripped it tight and brought it up to my chest, ready to swing at the man. That #8217;s if he didn #8217;t shoot me. The lounge door slowly opened, interrupting my train of thought, a middle aged man dressed in black, dirty clothing torn in places, walked into the room. He was holding a sawn off shotgun, it looked dirty and old. I pressed my eye to the gap, the man looked around and his cold black eyes settled on my refuge. He moved towards the door, panicking silently I needed a plan. He was by the sofa, 8 feet away, in 10 seconds I would be dead and my anus probably getting filled with psycho-man sperm. 6feet. I had to do something, smash the door open? 4feet. Jump out and hit him with the bat? 2 feet. REACT! I smashed hard on the door, it swung into the man and gun hard. The impact had made his trigger finger slip and the second barrel went off. I had no other choice, I had to kill him. I swung the aluminium plated bat down hard, each swing landed on his upper body, I could heard the thump of each swing. The bat must of made contact with his skull because the sound of skull cracking egged me on harder. A primal scream had filled my head, and the sight of the creep #8217;s blood fed an insatiable appetite to live. The minutes had dragged by during the struggle, I hadn #8217;t stopped until I knew he was dead. A sizeable pool of blood saturated the carpet around him, his mutilated face and head, swollen and bloody. The black eyes stared up at me from the eternal abyss. I dropped to the sofa crying and shaking, shock took me and I felt empty to the world around me. Some time later the police had cordoned my apartment off, CSI investigators combed through the scene for several hours, regular uniforms asked me to recount the twisted tale numerous times, often asking changing questions to possibly catch me out. Finally satisfied they told me they would be in touch. When I was allowed back into my apartment I was shocked to see the blood still soaked into my carpet, the body was long gone to the Examiners office. I decided to call the landlord in the morning, he would have to fit a new carpet. I sat by the window, staring out to space. Lights danced in my line of vision, blurred orbs in the distance. I had gone to the 24hr place a while ago and bought a 6 pack of beer and 20 cigarettes. I hadn #8217;t smoked in 10 years, but if there was ever a good time to smoke now was it. I finished a smoke and opened the window more to flick out the ember, I watched it fall, tumbling in midair. The ember burnt up as it hit the ground and I noticed it landed some few meters from the cursed evergreen. I looked at the top of the tree, swaying in the gentle breeze left over from the winds of earlier. My eyes dropped their gaze down the length of the tree till I reached the bottom. My heart stopped. I ran cold. There he stood, the watcher, the centurion of nightmares. Unchanged, Undead. He stepped forwards into the light of the car park. He stood and stared up at me, transfixed in the window. That slow spreading sinister smile ran from cheek to cheek. I cried aloud and looked about me, there was nothing I could do. He stood for a minute smiling demonically, then turned on his heel and began to meander through the bushes into the darkness where he belongs. 6 weeks passed me by, I lost my job soon after the incident of that night. I was too scared to leave my apartment most days, and when I did I was a mess. I would jump as a door opened or somebody spoke behind me. I even struggled with people smiling, in every smile I could see that same sinister, stretched smile of the stranger. I called the police about him and they gave me all the details of the man on their records, even told me where he had been cremated. But I know their John Doe and my Monster are the same, I just can #8217;t explain how. Most nights he leaves me be, letting me rot and vegetate alone in my misery and paranoia. Some nights he stops by, smiling and watching my paralysis develop as I squirm under his devilish eyes. I know one day he will come back for me, and collect me. Maybe he is death, or the devil. All I know is he is attached to me by a bond stronger than stone. A bond of predator and prey. And there he is again. Smiling. Waiting.</TEXT>

    <TITLE>The Grove.</TITLE>
    <DATE>2020-05-01 12:47:03</DATE>
    <TEXT>The woods around my town are haunted by an unspeakable evil. A monster that lurks in the darkest hollows of the dead oaks. Growing up I always heard stories, savage tales of lost children turning up weeks later in varying states of decaying pieces. I never truly believed them, I mean why would you? After all, spooky stories are just that, stories. That was until I was 17, the local news erupted with a story. A boy of 10 named Tommy had wandered into the woods one day, maybe in search of slow worms and other critters. He had gone around 1pm, and not returned for his curfew of 6pm, he was searched for by many of the town's folks. But to no avail, his body was never found. Well was never found whole, 3 weeks after the disappearance parts of his body were recovered from the part of the woods known as the Grove, a thickly grown part of the woods where sunlight never reached. The Grove was avoided by all the townsfolk, I had once walked near and heard such strange noises that I ran away fast. Many of the locals didn't believe in the monster in the woods, but I couldn't help but think there was some truth in it, the running theory was the boys had been taken by a very human killer. My morbid curiosity led me to read up on the subject in the local news archive, the cases began in 1990, 30 years had gone by and in that time there had been 15 cases. That was 15 children of the local area who had gone missing in the woods and turned up in pieces weeks later. That very fact gave me a chilling feeling, my heart broke when I'd seen the many pictures of them, the ages ranged from 5 to 12, they all went missing in the same sort of area. After so many hours my mind and heart could not take any more of the research, it was horrifying to think of a small child so lost and afraid in the woods lured to its demise. A few months had passed and I occasionally dipped back into the research, it never truly went anywhere, I had hit a wall. Evidence of any kind of human killer was thin on the ground, no one had ever been suspected of the crimes, ever. In fact no real evidence had ever come to light, it was truly a mystery. I brought up maps on my laptop, zoomed into my town and then into the woods. I found the Grove on the aerial view, the dense treeline stood out from the rest immensely. The dark foreboding patch of green and black gave me the creeps, as if it's evil oozed from every pixel on my screen. I sat thinking for a while, staring at the screen transfixed by the dark patches, I had to visit the area. That in itself was a bad idea, whatever lay within the confines of the Grove's tangled roots be it man or monster, surely would take me to. The next day I packed a torch, survival kit and knife and my phone with a power bank. It was spring and the weather was fair, so I decided to wear a hoodie and jeans. I grabbed my stuff and left my house, and headed towards the woods. It took me about 30 minutes to get to the treeline, the first trees were the youngest saplings, as I travelled deeper the trees got older and thicker. I followed one of the many trails, they all entwined somewhere along the line, until I arrived on the outskirts of the Grove. I knew I had arrived by the difference in the light, everything was darker here. The birds didn't come to this part of the woods, the sunlight stayed away too. I felt the hairs on my neck stand on end, an eerie feeling washed over me, I was being watched. I found a relatively clear part of the thick bush and trees and broke through. The Grove was dark, the smell of rot hung in the air, the total area was no more than the size of half a football field. Many trees dotted around, most were big beastly specimens with a canopy that engulfed the sky, blocking all light. I looked around myself, if I had seen a picture of my viewpoint I'd believe it to be of any wood in the country, yet in person the malevolent atmosphere was oppressive. The trees in the Grove all had black trunks, the scattered boulders were thickly covered in mosses of greens and browns. I began to walk around, using the torch to see in the dim light, there was nothing disturbing in the area. As I walked past a particularly large tree I spotted something blue in the decaying leaves and dirt of the ground. I picked it up, a scrap of fabric most likely clothing. An image flashed back to me of one of the children, he had been wearing a blue jersey in the picture. My stomach dropped, somehow the situation had just become terribly real to me now. I walked further past a large boulder, beyond the boulder hidden by bushes of holly I noticed a dark mouth to a cave. My nerves had all but left me by now, the deathly silence of the Grove somehow managed to crush my spirit. It was as if the trees themselves sapped my heart of all the goodness to be had in the world, growing new branches on the desolation of man. I stood and looked at the mouth of the cave, like a hungry monster beckoning me further to be it's latest meal. A cool breeze was coming from the cave, yet no tree or leaves moved in it's exhale. I took my first step towards the opening, fear was building the closer I got. When I stood a meter away I could make out a few steps into the gloom, the rest was a scarlet sheet of unknown darkness. The cold breeze had now shifted it's direction, inhaling me into its mouth. The unnatural force of the wind pushing my back made me stumble forward towards the opening, as I entered the cave darkness swallowed my world. I was greeted by a disgusting smell, ammonia and sulfur, I recognised it from the chemical works in Town. I started to root in my bag until I found my torch, my hand rested on the handle of the bowie knife I had brought with me, it was probably a good idea to keep it in my hand ready. Around me was dirt and rocks, it looked as if someone had tunnelled into the ground through the rocks and dirt to create a cave. I turned the light on, my meager circle of light illuminated small sections of the walls and floor, I was on edge waiting for whatever lurked in the dark to jump out at me and take me from the mortal world into the next plains of suffering. But nothing did. Instead the stench of the cave grew more horrific as I descended into the unknown, the chemical smells had infused with the unmistakable stench of death. As I reached the end of the tunnel a sudden noise penetrated the silent darkness, movement ahead of me, I wasn't alone. I slowly moved the light around in front of me, trying to find the source of the noise. My hand shook slightly, making the beam of light shake, shadows danced around the visible portion of the cave. From what I could see the tunnel opened up into a small cavern, I took a step forward, my foot crushed something on the floor with a sickening snapping noise. I shone the light down at my feet in a panic, under my foot snapped clean in two was a bone. A small thigh bone to be exact. I shit myself, terror had been steadily since I entered the cave but now my panic levels were maxed out. I gave a cry of horror at the sight of the small bone. It was definitely from one of the children who had gone missing. Lost in the pure terror and grief of the situation I was brought back to reality as I heard a noise behind me, a scuttling noise like you would expect from vermin in a back alley dumpster. Only this noise was being made by something much larger, I wheeled around and brought both hands up in instinct, the knife poised in my hand aimed into the darkness, I used the torch to scan the area. Nothing. I heard the scuttle again, behind me deeper into the cavern, I spun around using the torch to see. My heart was beating fast and hard in my chest, I was convinced at any point it would give out and I would collapse in the dark of the putrid cave and never be found. Shaking the thoughts from my head I stepped forward, again crunching a bone on the floor. The scuttle came closer to me, I moved the torch to the point of the noise, what I saw has never left me. Four white skinned spidery limbs, attached in impossible ways to a torso that looked faintly human, sitting atop the monstrosity was a head, it was completely bald with a slit for a mouth and two large eyes the colour of snow. I gave a shriek of terror, began to slash in vain at the air in front of me with the knife. The thing looked at me and opened its mouth to an unimaginable size, it let out an unworldly screeching noise. The sound made my eardrums hurt, my head shook with the reverberations as did the cave. Trying to keep my light steady on the monster I lunged towards it with the knife outstretched. I felt the knife hit something fleshy and heavy, in a frenzy I began to hack and slash, the monster shrieked and thrashed before me as each of my attacks found their home in its devilish body. I don't know how I managed to fight the denizen, I had been overcome with panic and fear one moment and the next a unending fury that led me to attack until my foe fell in a heap on the floor. I dropped to my knees, exhausted, with the light I examined the beast in front of me. The white skin stretched over the many bones of it's skeleton, the blank face that displayed malice now looked strangely peaceful. I was shaking hard, and the words 'Get Out' screamed in every part of my body. My feet took control of the situation, I stood up and made for the entrance to the tunnel. As I got to the opening in the wall, I heard a noise that made me scream in panic and fear. The scuttling. I turned the light back around to see the heaped form of the beast moving, sickening crunching noises came from the corpse. It wasn't dead! It began to get back on all fours. My legs carried me faster than ever before in my life, I ran through the darkness towards the pale patch of light coming from the cave's mouth. Soon I had cleared the opening, back into the Grove I felt free. I didn't stop running until I had cleared the woods, and was back on my street. I looked around me, so many people were milling around their houses in a state of blissful ignorance at the true horror that lay within the woods. That night I didn't sleep, the images of the beast haunted my closed eyes, I had been sure it was dead yet as I left it stood back up. I know if I had never run, I would have been part of the statistic of unexplained deaths in the forest. Part of me felt lucky, but the majority felt unlucky, I had seen death and escaped but the many children hadn't been so lucky. I felt sick thinking about the disgusting monster devouring the small legs and arms of a child, cleaning the flesh from bone and spitting out the gristle. I write this now in an attempt to warn others, locals and tourists, the woods that surround Allerhurst are evil. They hold many forgotten evils, many twisted truths. If you go walking in the woods, you may never return. At best only a small part of you will get lost, like myself, but your body will be whole unlike so many others. So be warned dear reader, the woods hold the truest horrors of our earth, and they're hungry.</TEXT>

As I walked past a particularly large tree I spotted something blue in the decaying leaves and dirt of the ground. I picked it up, a scrap of fabric most likely clothing. An image flashed back to me of one of the children, he had been wearing a blue jersey in the picture. My stomach dropped, somehow the situation had just become terribly real to me now. I walked further past a large boulder, beyond the boulder hidden by bushes of holly I noticed a dark mouth to a cave. My nerves had all but left me by now, the deathly silence of the Grove somehow managed to crush my spirit. It was as if the trees themselves sapped my heart of all the goodness to be had in the world, growing new branches on the desolation of man. I stood and looked at the mouth of the cave, like a hungry monster beckoning me further to be it's latest meal. A cool breeze was coming from the cave, yet no tree or leaves moved in it's exhale. I took my first step towards the opening, fear was building the closer I got. When I stood a meter away I could make out a few steps into the gloom, the rest was a scarlet sheet of unknown darkness. The cold breeze had now shifted it's direction, inhaling me into its mouth. The unnatural force of the wind pushing my back made me stumble forward towards the opening, as I entered the cave darkness swallowed my world. I was greeted by a disgusting smell, ammonia and sulfur, I recognised it from the chemical works in Town. I started to root in my bag until I found my torch, my hand rested on the handle of the bowie knife I had brought with me, it was probably a good idea to keep it in my hand ready. Around me was dirt and rocks, it looked as if someone had tunnelled into the ground through the rocks and dirt to create a cave. I turned the light on, my meager circle of light illuminated small sections of the walls and floor, I was on edge waiting for whatever lurked in the dark to jump out at me and take me from the mortal world into the next plains of suffering. But nothing did. Instead the stench of the cave grew more horrific as I descended into the unknown, the chemical smells had infused with the unmistakable stench of death. As I reached the end of the tunnel a sudden noise penetrated the silent darkness, movement ahead of me, I wasn't alone. I slowly moved the light around in front of me, trying to find the source of the noise. My hand shook slightly, making the beam of light shake, shadows danced around the visible portion of the cave. From what I could see the tunnel opened up into a small cavern, I took a step forward, my foot crushed something on the floor with a sickening snapping noise. I shone the light down at my feet in a panic, under my foot snapped clean in two was a bone. A small thigh bone to be exact. I shit myself, terror had been steadily since I entered the cave but now my panic levels were maxed out. I gave a cry of horror at the sight of the small bone. It was definitely from one of the children who had gone missing. Lost in the pure terror and grief of the situation I was brought back to reality as I heard a noise behind me, a scuttling noise like you would expect from vermin in a back alley dumpster. Only this noise was being made by something much larger, I wheeled around and brought both hands up in instinct, the knife poised in my hand aimed into the darkness, I used the torch to scan the area. Nothing. I heard the scuttle again, behind me deeper into the cavern, I spun around using the torch to see. My heart was beating fast and hard in my chest, I was convinced at any point it would give out and I would collapse in the dark of the putrid cave and never be found. Shaking the thoughts from my head I stepped forward, again crunching a bone on the floor. The scuttle came closer to me, I moved the torch to the point of the noise, what I saw has never left me. Four white skinned spidery limbs, attached in impossible ways to a torso that looked faintly human, sitting atop the monstrosity was a head, it was completely bald with a slit for a mouth and two large eyes the colour of snow. I gave a shriek of terror, began to slash in vain at the air in front of me with the knife. The thing looked at me and opened its mouth to an unimaginable size, it let out an unworldly screeching noise. The sound made my eardrums hurt, my head shook with the reverberations as did the cave. Trying to keep my light steady on the monster I lunged towards it with the knife outstretched. I felt the knife hit something fleshy and heavy, in a frenzy I began to hack and slash, the monster shrieked and thrashed before me as each of my attacks found their home in its devilish body. I don't know how I managed to fight the denizen, I had been overcome with panic and fear one moment and the next a unending fury that led me to attack until my foe fell in a heap on the floor. I dropped to my knees, exhausted, with the light I examined the beast in front of me. The white skin stretched over the many bones of it's skeleton, the blank face that displayed malice now looked strangely peaceful. I was shaking hard, and the words 'Get Out' screamed in every part of my body. My feet took control of the situation, I stood up and made for the entrance to the tunnel. As I got to the opening in the wall, I heard a noise that made me scream in panic and fear. The scuttling. I turned the light back around to see the heaped form of the beast moving, sickening crunching noises came from the corpse. It wasn't dead! It began to get back on all fours. My legs carried me faster than ever before in my life, I ran through the darkness towards the pale patch of light coming from the cave's mouth. Soon I had cleared the opening, back into the Grove I felt free. I didn't stop running until I had cleared the woods, and was back on my street. I looked around me, so many people were milling around their houses in a state of blissful ignorance at the true horror that lay within the woods. That night I didn't sleep, the images of the beast haunted my closed eyes, I had been sure it was dead yet as I left it stood back up. I know if I had never run, I would have been part of the statistic of unexplained deaths in the forest. Part of me felt lucky, but the majority felt unlucky, I had seen death and escaped but the many children hadn't been so lucky. I felt sick thinking about the disgusting monster devouring the small legs and arms of a child, cleaning the flesh from bone and spitting out the gristle. I write this now in an attempt to warn others, locals and tourists, the woods that surround Allerhurst are evil. They hold many forgotten evils, many twisted truths. If you go walking in the woods, you may never return. At best only a small part of you will get lost, like myself, but your body will be whole unlike so many others. So be warned dear reader, the woods hold the truest horrors of our earth, and they're hungry.</TEXT>

Writing is an art form that takes practice, it's a skill to be honed. You think all the Journalists of the world woke up one day with the ability to write an informative article about a subject? Nope they went off to study and learn how to write properly. I haven't got any degrees but I practice my writing daily and try to express myself with as few words possible, whilst keeping the narrative on track and informative! Keep Writing!! Keep going no matter what!</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I used to be a proper cunt about it, I'd give people shit for not handling substances. Nowadays I only smoke 2 small joints in a day and I'm high all day long. In the sense that 2g can last me 5 days at the min. I used smoke about a Q a day and would laugh at my customers who bought 10er bags but still get baked! Dont get me started with stims and such, I used to munch pills and speed for fun, but if i tried it nowadays (i'm about 5 years clean off that shit) I'd be a tweeking mess after a few bumps.</TEXT>

    <TITLE>Millennium by Stieg Larsson.</TITLE>
    <DATE>2020-05-25 23:34:47</DATE>
    <TEXT>I love the actual trilogy, beautifully written stories full of intellectual plots and stunning character development. But sadly Larsson passed away before the books for a big hit. Then in walks David Lagercrantz, drafted in by Larsson #8217;s father and brother, who has done 3 books. The first one was acceptable, but then this last one number 3, it #8217;s a complete pile of crap!! It #8217;s absolutely terrible. Anyone else follow this line of thought?</TEXT>

You gotta take your meds! But hey look, you #8217;ve been really good lately and earned your star stickers all week, so we will put a few fossils on board.

    <TEXT>I #8217;ve seen plenty of barriers like these here in the uk. Plenty of force would be required to break (in a riot it could happen). I can see your point that it #8217;s a bit dodgy. But for who #8217;s benefit is this for? Cops or protesters?</TEXT>

    <TITLE>One of the cleaners at work is a Kevin.</TITLE>
    <DATE>2020-06-10 22:24:55</DATE>
    <TEXT>This guy is crazy, a few things he has done: 1. He will literally walk around the store we work at and pick the most random things for his food at break. One time I caught him microwaving a fresh pizza that as to be oven cooked. 2. Again, his diet consists of mainly microwave burgers and hotdogs, he once ate a 2.5ft long baguette filled with ham and no butter. 3. His main duty is cleaning the bakery at night, his uniform before he starts is already covered in dirt and flour. He then spends 3 hours shifting piles of flour around. He leaves the place just as dirty as when he began cleaning. 4. Kevin wears hearing aids, but when he is at work, he turns them off so he can #8217;t be spoken to. But this also means he #8217;s prone to screaming aloud when you walk near him and he doesn #8217;t see you. In total he #8217;s a strange guy, doesn #8217;t talk to many people and eats a very odd diet!</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Sounds like you got lucky! I got done at 16, had a bigger lock knife, living in a tent in the woods. Police come down looking for kids on the piss and I #8217;m sat there with the knife out and they arrested me for it ha! Bastards. I #8217;m wanting a decent knife that can be left in my rucksack (which gets used everyday) and forgotten about until I need it in woods or for any other needs. But I don #8217;t want a lock knife in there all the time. That #8217;s why I #8217;m thinking get this one</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Well I #8217;m in the UK, but I found this online which I assume relates to an American species: The Agricultural Research Service of the U.S. Department of Agriculture says the needles of the ponderosa pine, Pinus ponderosa, contain isocupressic acid, which can induce abortions during the first trimester of pregnancy in cattle. Other pine trees that contain isocupressic acid include the lodgepole pine (Pinus contorta), common juniper (Juniperus communis), and Monterey cypress (Cupressus macroparpa). These pine trees also may cause abortions in cattle. But in Europe the pine we see is usually edible. Pine needle tea! According to Advanced Bushcraft by Dave Canterbury, needles of eastern pines are extremely nutritious and have more vit c per weight than a orange, also high in vit A, pine tea is good for boosting your immune system. Parts of the pine you can use: Needles Roots Fatwood Inner bark Sap/Resin.</TEXT>

    <DATE>2020-07-01 10:39:54</DATE>
    <TEXT>Hello all! Hope you #8217;re having a good day, I just have a question for anyone interested! So next month I #8217;m going fishing/camping with my GF. We are gonna be camping near a large lake in the Lake District (local to us). Now I know that wild camping is Illegal (rolls eyes), but people are do it anyway and don #8217;t get much issue. But I #8217;m wondering about the legality of sitting next to a lake with a line in the water, sat in a bivvy. It #8217;s almost a grey area really in my opinion, I may be wrong though! What #8217;s the difference between camping next to a lake in a tent or a bivvy? Surely if some high viz tool came down to tell us off, as long as we are fishing then there #8217;s no law being broken?</TEXT>

    <TITLE>I was 4 years sober.</TITLE>
    <DATE>2020-07-25 04:22:43</DATE>
    <TEXT>Well first off I just wanna say that I am really just venting. I was 4 years sober, the exact time I was with my ex. I broke up with her recently, I developed feelings for another woman. I started smoking pot again about 7 months ago, I had quit with my ex about a year prior. Now I know what you're thinking, the title says 4 years, well that's more about hard drugs (anything other than weed really). I had developed a codeine addiction after taking them too often for a back pain that seemed more ghostly then real on most days. My ex had gone on a night out, she ended up sniffing ket and I decided that night that fuck it, imma smoke me some pot! Well fast forward and I'm sat here at 5:15 at my mum's house (I'm 24, lived with ex for 4 years in our own house) coked up, drinking, smoking bud and popping a few codeines. My life has turned into a mess in literally 10 days. I seshed a few days ago for like 4 days. It's getting out of hand really.  #8203; I dunno what I expect by writing all this down. I know a few tweaker sorts will probably read it and enjoy it. I just feel stuck. Like life lost it's sparkle, it's just a boring monochrome still image glued to my eyes. I dunno what else to do. I know that getting wrecked isn't the answer but I can't help myself from just taking it to the edge.  #8203; Anyway thanks for reading.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Sitting smoking weed in a very nice park, a sudden bus load of Chinese tourists swarm the place and start doing their thing; taking pictures of trees, lampposts and post boxes. Me and a mate are sat there on a bench chonging on a one hitter pipe. This old couple are making their way towards us, they look rather well to do. They approach us and start miming a camera, I think they want us to take their picture together...... NOPE. The old dude comes over after I nodded and sits in between me and my mate and his wife takes the picture! Even put his arm around us both. They thanked us and left. Somewhere in China me and my mate are in a photo album.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Woke up super early to go fishing, my gf was pregnant with our son at the time. Well I needed a shit, bad, but my gf had developed a super human sense of smell and would complain a lot about me shitting. So I decide to just leave the house and I'd take a shit at a nearby shopping center. I made my way down the road, touching cloth hoping it would stay in my arse. I got to the Shopping center to find it was closed, plan b was McDonald's, about half a mile away. So I set off sheepishly trying to hold this shit, every step feels like it's pushing it out and I'm sweating. I get half way there and feel a pushing from my arse, I ran into the nearest Bush. Only problem was I was wearing chest waders, so I had to take them off whilst trying to hold onto the shit. I failed. Halfway through getting them off my arse released the mess. Had to carry on walking to McDonald's with a shitty arse and wearing full fishing gear.</TEXT>
