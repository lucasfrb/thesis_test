    <TEXT>Well I calculated that in order to get the pz IV anko you need to get 20-21 consecutive wins or 84 consecutive losses. This is assuming you have premium time and are playing tier 10 throughout. I came to this conclusion after studying the GUP event vid where hey showed 31000 banners are needed ( you earn it just by playing games not missions ) to get the tank. Assuming u get a Low roll for both losses and wins. That means Losses= 250 banners w/o premium time Or 375 banners with premium time Wins= 1000 banners w/o premium time Or 1500 banners with premium time Assuming u play three hours a day of blitz, it would take u 2-3days of losing constantly at tier 10 with premium time to get the anko All in all I say this is a good event that is close to the original anko event.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>It seems my calculation were off Anko needs 58730 which means that u would need to play 40 victories to get it at tier 10 with premium time. Twice the time it needs but still not so bad. Kuro needs 48 victories at tier 10 with premium time, just 8 more victories than anko. Surprisingly easier than the original event I must say. This is all assuming u have all Low rolls</TEXT>

    <TEXT>U should weigh the food with an electronic food scale that you are eating. Weigh your uncooked food (or 200g of raw chicken not 200g of cooked chicken) and log it in a fitness app like myfitnesspal. U might not be losing because u might be eating more than your maintenance calories or just nice there. Drink lots of water to curb hunger also. Secondly, weight loss is not a quick process and takes time to see results so don't give up and weigh in weekly and soon u will start seeing change. Don't give up!</TEXT>

    <TEXT>It is not an Asian dictatorship but a fledgling democracy that still needs help with kicking out the military from its constitution where the military holds 25% of the seats and in order for anything to be passed must have 75% approval by the parliament. It would be helpful if people could understand there is effectively 2 governments at the moment in Burma at the moment, one being the civilian and one being the military. The military controls the important ministries such as the ministry of defence, internal affairs and homeland security. Effectively, any wrong move by the civilian government and boom we will be back at square one with that Asian dictatorship. So while the military go romping around commiting human right abuses and atrocities, the civilian government gets the blame with the western media screeching  #8220;oh Aung San Su Kyi commiting genocide #8221; this dosent help the civilian government more power at all but just let the military government hunker down. They did it in the 60s to the 90s and they can do it again. If u look at the general consensus of the population u can see the signs of isolation setting in. So unless if u want to lose a potential democratic country and a western ally, westerners have to really evaluate whether if the response is proportionate at all and it could start on a individual basis.</TEXT>

    <TITLE>An interesting prototype by the Burmese military where a WMA301 turret and gun is mated with a MTLB chassis to create this tank destroyer/IFV? The only spec that is know currently is that it is fielding a 105mm gun that can reliably penetrate the frontal plate of a T-55 and a T-62.</TITLE>

    <TEXT>Well the Most modern MBT the Burmese military have is the Al Khalid/MBT 2000 and even then there isn #8217;t a lot of it. They fields more of the t72s and type 69s. Even then 105mm gun is enough to penetrate the regional armoured vehicles. Plus, the 2s1 is recently put into domestic production (with the BTRU4 with the help of Ukraine that is setting up the factories there) and there already is existing production of the WMA301. Combining these two domestic production makes some sense to create a cheap fire support vehicle that is capable of knocking out most regional armoured vehicles.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>The Rakhine people even in Myanmar have been generally seen as...nuts. No mistake it is our fault when the junta purposefully starved the state of development. How? The two roads into the states are small mountain roads that have been there since the 1700s! They post checkpoints there to control the Rakhine people. Now couple the lack of opportunity to prosper and educational standard even compared to the piss poor standard of the rest of the country, it is no surprise that the ethnic people is more leaning towards the extremist side. The PRC #8217;s backfired arming program of the Karen Independent Army (KIA) which in turn armed the Arakan Army (AA) was a huge backfire as it noes threatens the Belt and road initiative so there is still hope of Chinese pressure for peace between the AA and the Tatmadaw. The current attempt to draw investment into Rakhine by Daw Aung San Su Kyi is a start towards healing the ravages of war but with the Tatmadaw still having political power and just generally sabotaging the civilian government, one can only hope and see...</TEXT>

If they are of age and want to transition than I #8217;ll say go ahead but no when they are young.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Look at this way, you are a German soldier, with a wife and two young kids back home. U were forced to join the army when the Wehrmacht started extensive conscription and you would be executed by the bastard SS if u didn #8217;t join. So all of a sudden, the war ends,thank god you can surrender and return home to your family, all you gotta do is wait for the allied forces to show up and hopefully not start any fight or literally go out into the streets( which they didn #8217;t). Suddenly a bunch of partisans with guns show up and demand you surrender to them. However you remember how some of the lads have treated the natives a couple months before or how the SS were being arseholes a few days before and you thought, hey if it were me I would fucking execute all german troops for that. Your chance of returning home to your family just disappeared so you refuse until you see allied troops which you know will let you live until trial. But then the partisans run into the crowds and start shooting at you! So you have now two choices. 1. Don #8217;t shoot back and be overran and Executed by them or 2. Fire back hopefully not hitting the crowd(impossible with that many people) and hold out until the allied forces show up to take control of the situation.</TEXT>

Burmese cinema needs a revival that some expats are trying to do but are meeting with fierce resistance. Take those movie as the trashier of the bad Bollywood films with bad acting, plots and production made to only earn quick buck</TEXT>

    <TEXT>U forget the hell hole of a jungle and mountainous terrain that Rakhine is with superior Burmese Pilots due to endless combat missions in internal civil wars. The recent acquisitions for the blue water navy is a tougher challenge compared to what happened in 2008. With 2 modern missile frigates, one LPD, one kilo sub, several modern corvettes with the ability to keep manufacturing arms and ships in wartime will make the war very bloody and costly compared to 2008 where they only had 2 Chinese frigates and some old ww2 ships. The rest of the ships can #8217;t even enter blue waters then. All the tatmadaw have to do is to bog the Bangladeshi army in Rakhine and u would be out attrition there. There are only two passages into Rakhine state and even if Bangladesh manage to occupy it, it is going to be hell to break out of. With new APC and SPG manufacturing plants coming online this year and some form of domestic UAV and trainer aircraft production available. They would definitely be able to outlast Bangladesh in terms of equipment. But war is not necessary Nor is covert action. It is a waste of money that should be used elsewhere in bettering and raising the standard of living of both countries Edit: also don #8217;t forget the fanaticsm of Burmese troops. In civil war they may be of poor quality but it is in a way attributed to war exhaustion and fighting against their  #8216;own countrymen #8217; per say. If the whole damn country collectively hates the Rohingya because they are perceived to be Bangladeshis and enough to commit genocide, what do u think will happen when the Bangladesh actually Attack the country? The whole country would be up in arms and won #8217;t matter if it is Burmese or Karen or Kachin anymore. I sincerely believe if war is to break out with no foreign interference, it would boil down to vietnam style Guerilla fighting in Rakhine if Bangladesh manage to occupy it and Iran-iraq war style fighting that will bring no good to both countries and will end up like the afghan/iraq war with no point in it.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Racism is still racism. Yes the institutionised racism that people of Color suffered is something not to downplayed at. However, it dosent make it right if you start doing it against white people. Be the change u want to be. Yes the system need to be change, but we can #8217;t sacrifice the same basic right that white people should have as black people in the process of that change. The problem right now is that the entertainment industry is really racist and is doing this and justifying it as tokenism for people like you. Instead what social justice and equality should be pushing for is for these studios and producers to get off their lazy asses and create films based on minority cultures. I mean I would love to see the story of Shaka Zulu, the Carthaginian empire, the Egyptian empires, or even that one dude who was so rich he destabilised the whole of Africa #8217;s economy because he was throwing gold around while on a pilgrim. That #8217;s what we should be fighting for not accepting these lazy ass  #8216;oh let #8217;s make Achilles black because diversity #8217; bullshit Also I #8217;m an Asian dude that don #8217;t live in the US or Europe so I should not be caring about this but I believe that the equality movement should not have to cost another race because they were the oppressors because if we are also racist to them, are we any better? Edit: if the studio really really wanted to have a black actor, why not talk about this guy https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Memnon_(mythology) he fought in the Trojan war in Defense of troy! HE IS BLACK AS DEPICTED. Like why so lazy. He would be such an underrepresented character that is such a good and juicy opportunity to have diversity also.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I #8217;m not sure if this is going to be unpopular but I fully support her decision to defend the country in the ICJ. While I know that the tatmadaw definitely has commited war crimes in Rakhine in the clearance operations, I do not wish for the country to bend over backward for every whims and demands of the international community. Internal country affairs should remain internal and investigated accordingly. If not the sovereignty of the country would be violated. I also believe that if we allow for the infringement this time around, it will set a precedent and would be harder for us to fight off overt foreign interference in how the country is run the next time around. We have to show that we will not tolerate foreign interference as Long as our judicial system is not defunct. Hence, I fully support her defending the country in the ICJ but at the same time believes that we should work together to develops a mechanism to hold those responsible accountable.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>PCs has always been superior and always will be. Now hear me out. Consoles take huge losses in selling their consoles but make it back in other things like live services and games. Now to the core part, consoles are in general, a lot smaller then the towering MaTX PCs. This solves a lot of problems for manufacturers such as cooling, power supply and putting in a bigger die size for their components In addition, consoles games are optimised by Developers and fine tuned to run at specific hardware selections. Software is also dedicated to ensuring the games have all the limited resources at its need. This leads to consoles running at medium but looking high quality settings. PCs trumps over consoles in this regard but because the amount of hardware is so varying, the optimisation is not as good on the pc So while it is impossible for PCs to replace consoles at the current price point with similar performance currently, when the next generation of hardware comes out this September, you would be hard pressed to find a pc that would not outperform consoles at a slightly higher price bracket. As the new hardware would most likely to handle new games at 4k60fps easily even for entry level cards provided u play at Low-medium settings and optimise the settings yourself, which is equivalent to what consoles are doing.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>The some people that don #8217;t know that there is a pandemic going on has been disproven as myth by the World Health Organization in myanmar. This is due to the fact that other then the internet, most of myanmar still uses radio and television to get their news. Hence with good radio coverage throughout the country, these two states do know what #8217;s going on even without internet. What most western media fails to mention is that myanmar is fighting a civil war akin to the Afghanistan insurgency. It started out as ethnic freedom groups which was fair enough but then these groups (TNLA and the Arakan army) started Kidnapping government officials and shooting police in cities and towns. Several Indian workers also lost their lives when they attacked a barge for an Indian infrastructure project and some died in their custody when they were captured. The TNLA also launched rocket attacks (think katyusha) near major cities in these states and many of the major highways are mined and have IEDS on the roadsides. A lot of aid could not get through without a military convoy and even then some get shot up in the case of the WHO van carrying Covid 19 samples. A lot of western media would portray these states as cut off from communication and having no supplies, constantly under Attack by the military but in reality, supplies do flow in after clearing operations and inevitable civilian casualties occur as the insurgents groups uses towns and cities as shields to fire at military targets. There were combat footage of both sides where there would be a civvy Land Rover in the middle of the road and a insurgent firing at military targets from behind the vehicle. They also commited arguably war crimes when they executed military POWs when they took a military training facility. Hence, it is somewhat understandable that internet access is cut off so that insurgents have a harder time mobilising and communicating between each other and out of state actors. Now dont get me wrong, the military does a lot of fucked up shit too but the civilian government is stuck between a rock and a hard place. The military is using the civil war as proof that the civilian government is incompetent and is actively trying to take over again killing the infant democratic system in place. Hence, to placate the military and Ensure that democratic traditions take root, the civilian government have no choice but to play along for now.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I have a problem when they half ass write women or POC into a story or replace an actual operation where men died with a Super woman that did it right, can survive frostbite and still take down nazis. I don #8217;t have a problem if they wrote about the female resistance fighters, night witches that terrified Germans in their BIPLANES or those female sniper or that one girl who demanded a tank to avenge her husband. But no, lazy ass EA has to half ass it. That #8217;s what i have issues with. Same thing with POC. Oh no BBC ain #8217;t gonna write about Shaka Zulu but ACHILLES black. Smh dude Edit: in the Trojan war, there was an entire contingent of black Ethiopian troops fighting for the Trojans and it is documented. However, there #8217;s nothing about those guys.

    <TEXT>I don #8217;t mind having women in my games or playing as black dudes. The problem is when they are forced in the story or badly written. I dont support lazy ass writing that just do it for diversity sake. If they want to write the stories of women and POC, they gotta do it right. The Senegalese story line while not really accurate, I have no issue with as Senegalese troops served France in ww2. That one Mission with the girl in Norway is not ok though. It #8217;s not because it #8217;s a woman lead but because they replaced an entire commando team that took part in that operation with a mother and her daughter. Lives were lost in that operation, the disrespect smh. If they want to do it properly then i would love to see the night witches. They terrorised German troops by bombing them at night using BIPLANES. That #8217;s one hella interesting story right there. The big issue tho is women characters in multiplayer. That #8217;s just plain wrong. Women played a huge part in ww2, especially during ww2 AS factory workers and filling up jobs left by men who went to fight the war. It #8217;s worse for the axis side where women were made to leave their jobs and be housewives. Gypsies and blacks were sent to concentration camps even IF some agreed to fight for the nazis. By portraying a black woman in a nazi uniform is just plain disrepect to the sufferings of those in the war. Tbh in multiplayer, I really wouldn #8217;t have minded if women were allowed in the Russian faction as the scout or sniper class because they really did take part in combat roles on the eastern front. Otherwise it #8217;s just not respecting the war itself.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I #8217;m not talking badly written as in character or story wise but historically. When the Arabian guy in Lawrence of Arabia was played by a white guy there was a considerable backlash against it. Hollywood always had a problem with whitewashing and it has also been a minor problem in gaming although not to that extent. The problem starts when black washing or something like that happens. Let #8217;s take the example of Achilles in the new BBC series. It is balant black washing of history and is lazy writing of diversity. Instead of writing Achilles as black becauses hes a more well known character. Why not write about Memnon, an Ethiopian king that is considered equal in skill and strength to Achilles. He brought an army to Troy in Defense of it against the Greek armies. Now that is an interesting story point to explore instead of the same plot point with Achilles and it also makes the story diverse. If it is not ok for whitewashing of history then is it also not ok for history to be black washed. History should be represented as it is and not to fit someone #8217;s agenda. Now onto battlefield V. As i said I #8217;ve have no problem with them having women or POC as Leads and i feel like the senagalwse soldier #8217;s are arc done properly even though it is not the most historically accurate thing. The problem arise for the Norway Mission though. In the Norway Mission you play as a mother and daughter duo who fought as spontaneous resistance fighters to prevent nazis from transporting heavy water back to Germany for their nuclear program. The problem is...the operation took place, made by all white men. Operation grouse was a SOE operation that planned four Norwegian commandos in advance on the assault. It was followed by a failed operation freshman where British paratroopers tried to drop in on location but failed and was either killed in the crash or was captured, interrogated and EXECUTED by the gestapo. The team of SOE trained aforementioned Norwegian commandos then undertook the Mission and destroyed the heavy water plant on their own. The team of Norwegian commandos and the British troops whom were killed were replaced by two women where one would drop into the icy river for several hours, not die due to frostbite and still be up and kicking and snapping Nazi necks. Don #8217;t you think this is disrespectful to the Norwegian commandos that went through hell to get the plant destroyed? The British soldiers that were killed in the crash or worse, tortured and then executed by nazis? If they wanted to tell the stories of less renown then do a story arc about the night witches. These women were so fucking ballsy they flew their biplanes at night. Cut off their engine and glided their way to the bombig point and drop the bombs, leaving on the noise of wind in their wake. This was how the Germans referred to the wind as broomsticks and likened the unit to the  #8216;night witches #8217;. And then onto multiplayer. Yes people should have a choice to choose what they want to play but when does the choice becomes disrespectful? During hitlers rise to power from the 30s to 39, the nazis ousted a lot of working women from their jobs and forced them back into their homes as housewives and essentially child machines. Women were ousted from being Doctors, artists and much more from their lives being ruined. Then to make it worse, young girls were more often then not married off to the healthiest looked Nazi soldier or offical in the name of making more healthy babies for the Reich. Womens rights were the lowest during the reign of Nazi germany. Then BFV came along and said, hey you could play as a women in a NAZI uniform! Now there is a big problem as disrepect to what women suffered through under the nazis. BF1 got it right. Allied troops and Germans troops dont normally have women in it. However, Russian faction have women as scouts and snipers and there was no giant backlash at it. Sure there may be some misogynistic gamers that is just sexist but in general there isn #8217;t any bad backlash. Why is that? Well we do know Russian women both fought in ww1 and ww2 mostly as scouts and snipers so it is ok to have them in the Russian faction in combat roles. Allied factions don #8217;t have women in combat roles but they did serve as Nurses and transport Drivers. Women also done a great job at the factories back home and farms supplying the armies of the allied forces. History dosen #8217;t care about what you feel or your agendas or your wants. It just is. It will just be equally wrong to replace the Norwegian commandos with two white men so is two white women. It should not be altered or be rewritten to fit our current societal norms or beliefs due for the fact that history is an important reminder to us of what happened lest we repeat the same mistake. No matter the form of medium, be it games, books or television.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>True. But it is my right to protest it by not buying the game so i didn #8217;t. BF1 was such a good game though. The ironic thing is the devs said if you dont like it, don #8217;t buy it and the sales figures showed. Regardless, my wallet my choice. I spend it on squad, post scriptum and the Verdun series. Much more accurate games from a historical standpoint i suppose</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I #8217;m born in myanmar but raised in Singapore but there are ways that 3rd world and developing countries could wane of fossil fuels. like the original poster said, LNG is indeed quite cheap and way more cleaner then fuel. Solar power is also getting cheaper. In myanmar project bank, a website dedicated to make all projects in myanmar transparent by the government, it is indicative that in the short term, power could be bought off larger nations that produces excess power while development could be poured into solar farms, wind turbine farms and LNG plants. In fact with the help of the Japanese aid and investment group JICA, Myanmar has a huge list of renewable projects that is either already being implemented or is in the conceptual or tender stage. So yes, it is possible for 3rd world countries to switch to renewable energy since they dont have the infrastructure to begin with so it is easier and much cheaper to do so. The problem is for developed nations as they have no monetary incentive to adopt the newer technologies.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I live in Singapore and all of us are mandated to wear a mask when we go out. There are also stringent contact tracing procedures where you would have to check in wherever you go, be it school, shopping mall or heck the bloody subway. We had a partial lockdown with only essential services for two months and now we no longer have any new Covid cases and recovering cases are increasing. If only people did their part instead of being selfish pricks and followed proper procedures. America wouldn #8217;t be in this position right now.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Right because giving up our freedom for a little while means we can get back to our normal lives faster. Of course the government dosent always want whats is best for us. But at the same time, is it really a time to ponder over those questions when lives are on the line? Not just literal lives but also the livelihoods of people that loses their jobs or are unable to work due to the situation? In that case, I am willing to give up some personal liberties to ensure that we all get through it alive and survive. As u have a right to your own personal freedom and personal lives, u do not have a right to destroy another person #8217;s life or livelihood which *could* be a source of their own personal freedom. Thus wouldn #8217;t it be better if we just helped each other out a little?</TEXT>

    <TEXT>One of the main reasons why hormonal therapy or transitioning should be made law that minors are not allowed to take part in it. If we can #8217;t trust minors to vote, drink, smoke or whatever else. Then life changing matters should not be placed in their hands or that of their parents.</TEXT>
