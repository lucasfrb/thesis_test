    <TEXT>Hey everyone, So I want to endeavour on a career into cybersecurity and coding. Right now with the whole Covid-19 and the financial strain it causes, going to university is unfeasible. Do I need a bachelors degree in IT / Computer Science to succeed? There are so many online courses and it is overwhelming. Can I make a career out of this just through some online courses and putting together a portfolio? Regards, a boy with a computer.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Hey everyone. I'm currently familiarising myself with Trackion Waveform 11, but I can't figure out how to change the volume (and other settings) of a single track throughout the progression of the song. At the moment all I can do is change the master volume. On garageband there was a setting where you could click on a line and it would a point which you can move around to change the volume at different points. Does anyone know what this is called on Waveform?</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Hey everyone, I'm working with a ROLI Seaboard. At this point Tracktion Waveform 11 makes the most sense for me as it came with the ROLI device. While using garageband, there was a setting where it allows you to change the volume of a single track at different sections of the song. I could plot single points throughout the line and change the pitch volume(?). My question is, where can I find this on Waveform 11? I'm not fully with the technical terms of everything as I am new to making soundscapes etc. Any help is fully appreciated, thank you.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Hey everyone, I'm working with a Seaboard and Logic Pro X. I'm annoyed that I keep on hearing crackling especially when I'm using lower frequencies and also if I am pressing more than 2-3 keys. Has anyone had similar problems? Is there any settings I can change to reduce / prevent this? Besides that I'm loving the board, but it is hard to get passed without flipping my noodle. Thanks in advance.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Hey everyone, I posted in here not too long ago about getting crackling issues using my seaboard block in logic pro x. I have played around with latency and buffer, and I am still getting the same issue. This is really frustrating me. It only seems to be when I am using Roli Studio Player as a plug in. I haven't upgraded Equator and I don't have Cyber / Strobe. Anyone have any more pointers besides so I can stop complaining haha. I want to love my Seaboard, but this is getting annoying.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>So far, I love the spell mechanics, and I like the sense of progression that comes with it. I just think that the gameplay is more suited to an arena style game or like Overwatch for example. The battle Royale is too random for me to actually invest in the game. 80% of it is just opening chests.</TEXT>
