    <TITLE>Suggestion: IR  amp; Thermal dynamic range depending on Day/Night Cycle. Also a few suggested game changes to make night fighting different to day.</TITLE>
    <DATE>2013-01-22 04:42:13</DATE>
    <TEXT>Edit: Stuffed up the title, Also a few suggested ideas to change night fighting: As it stand there is no difference between the IR/Thermal Sights during the day and night, I propose a range reduction on the Thermal  amp; IR during the day,  amp; increase the range at night. Also make it quite clear on the vehicular models that they have the different scopes on their weapons, colored light or lazer (red for ir  amp; green for Thermal?, something not to obvious but clear to see, that would make the vehicle more obvious to see at night to balance the extra targeting ability that they get. This would make IR  amp; Thermal more situational and add another thing adding to the immersion of the game. A few more ideas to make night fighting different 1 Reduce spot distance  amp; timer during the night and increase it during the day. 2 The vehicle stealth cert option also reduces the spot time,  amp; how much you render on ir/thermal scopes, also reduce the visibility of the engine glows  amp; contrails. Any comments or additions to these ideas would be greatly appreciated.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Hi, i have almost finished the Sith Warrior storyline  amp; i was wondering which class i should choose to do next? I have heard the Imperial Agent is a good story to play, but i also would like to experience the republic side. Also would like to play a healer or tank based character as it seems everyone else is also playing a damage class. I mostly play just for the class/planetary quests  amp; a few flashpoints.</TEXT>

    <DATE>2014-12-17 10:41:58</DATE>
    <TEXT>At the moment medkit spam has become a bit of an issue. Especially when some people combine medkit spam while moving like [this](http://a.pomf.se/zosjce.webm). A possible option to counteract this to create a movement penalty for 3 seconds after using a medkit. (inability to sprint and reduced movement speed). Also the medkits could have a cooldown timer between uses. Are medkits overpowered as they currently are? If so what would you suggest that SOE does to rebalance medkits?</TEXT>

The amount of logistical support that the Imperial center had for the rest of the empire meant that when it fell it was basically impossible to run as a full blown empire.

    <TEXT>China is definitely more harsh on foreigners in its borders in the last few years. Has much more of expansionist foreign policy. Also their golden expansionist years are effectively over as their internal growth is slowing down, if not in full blown recession. They aren't going to blame themselves for it so they look outside their borders.</TEXT>

If it takes an extra 20 seconds to leave a compound that's 20 seconds less time on objective or 20 seconds less map control. Especially when the boardediup sections are usually just let the attackers get up to the wall and deny the hab.

    <TEXT>Cod is a casual game at the moment. If i wanted a competitive fix id play something else like csgo or rocket league. The game is so broken balance wise from weapons, killstreaks and map design that it is the definition of a casual game. Skill based match making should only be applied to a ranked game mode that also gives you feedback on what level you are at. Im only lvl 40 and have only been playing for less than a week but the last few games iv been placed in a ranking bracket that includes players that were at the level cap and completely focused on pubstomping. I think thats an achievement that i managed to get placed in such a rank but the only feedback i get that im in such a high skill group is that now im getting stomped by lvl 155 players. I dont see myself playing this game much longer if the sbmm isnt adjusted.</TEXT>

    <TEXT> gt; Class. Well, in Western countries, class doesn't really exist, we have no caste system like India, and the closest thing we've got, feudalism, basically got overthrown. What we have today is just distribution of labor/specialization. Ie, some people specialize in being a doctor while another specialize in being a plumber, and it depends on the job, because there's only a certain ammount of plumbing and healing that has to be done in any society. That way, you also get one guy who is good at being a doctor, and one guy who is good at being a plumber, instead of having two guy who are awful at both. Again, it's just smart, but communists think they can just ignore that... to catastrophic consequences. See how Mao tried to make farmers into steel workers, which create a famine and bad steel. Class is definitely a thing in western countries, its economic standing and there is a clear difference between the people who are born into poverty and those that are born with a silver spoon in their mouth. Its much easier to get a good education and a decent job when you have a supporting family. Not to mention that the connections of your family can set you up for life. When your parents both have to work full time just to keep food on the table and a shirt on your back there is little support for education and networking. We are currently witnessing the reduction of the middle class and its a disaster looming, the lower class hasn't got the descretionary income to spend on the wants based service  amp; goods part of the economy and the upper class doesn't spend as much of their income and invest most of it. Yes they make large purchases but their money gets locked away in property or other investments. Funnily enough the ones that are born into riches and go to collage on their parents hard earned money are most likely the ones that support communism when they reach collage.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Ok i was wrong it wasnt the first paragraph but the one dedicated to the zoe post. "The Zoe Post" and #BurgersAndFries  gt; On August 15, 2014, shortly after the Steam release of Depression Quest, Quinn's ex-boyfriend Eron Gjoni published a lengthy tirade against her on several gaming forums in which he accused her of having cheated on him during their brief relationship. He claimed his purpose was to warn others of her infidelity, a common justification given in the MRA community for harassment targeted at women. The threads were deleted and he was banned from those forums. Compared to the know your meme on the post which doesn't use opinionated language.  gt;The Zoe Post. On August 16th, 2014, game developer Zoe Quinn's ex-boyfriend Eron Gjoni published an online expose detailing their relationship called the Zoe Post. In the expose Gjoni claims Quinn cheated on him with several men in the gaming industry, including Kotaku journalist Nathan Grayson. These claims were subsequently refuted by Kotaku editor-in-chief Steve Totilo in a post on the website.[76] In this post he claims that the only time Nathan mentioned Quinn was in a post about a gaming competition known as GameJam.[77] The day following the publication of the Zoe Post, YouTuber MundaneMatt uploaded a video critiquing Quinn's game Depression Quest and commenting on the alleged affairs with men working in the video game industry.[3] The video was subsequently removed due to a copyright claim allegedly by Quinn for using a still image from the game.[2] On August 18th, YouTuber Internet Aristocrat uploaded the first in a series of videos titled Quinnspiracy Theory, in which he discusses the issue of cronyism in gaming media and the indie game development community.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Its called avoiding dead heading, and its key to getting decent returns in Transport Fever 2. You make sure that the return leg also has some sort of materials. Also the factories will produce to their maximum at level 1 without any demand. It depends on where your industries and producers are but the best are the ones that use the same cargo containers, but its not necessary as the goal is to cover the cost of the maintenance of the train at all times. For example: Station 1: Steel mill  amp; Wheat farm ---- Picks up Wheat Station 2: Food Factory  amp; Coal Mine ---- Unloads Wheat  amp; Picks up Coal The smaller distance between the Steel Mill  amp; Wheat farm can be covered by trucks as they don't have the larger overhead as much as the train does.

    <TEXT>Yes you can make a new "game" obviously it wont be able to be sold at all but it can be a viable entity that creates an entire new genre. Many of the most popular games started out as mods for others. MOBAs , counterstrike, teamfortress, autochess. Look at the history of DOTA  amp; DOTA2. How do valve have the rights to a sequel to a gamemode that was created inside WC3? Just because a mod was made using one games assets doesnt mean they have complete rights to the ideas within.

I dont even look at the epic store page because i never see it. However there are mods coming out for MW5 that i would like to try out and it feels like going back decades when mods had to be manually installed and managed. Steam workshop streamlined that entire process and i really miss it.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>The droids were not capable of true sentience. Even so the droid armies were integrated with many different models and manufacturers. So even if one model gained sentience and revolted it wouldnt be the the entire army. The main risk would be a rogue general or system splitting off and creating their own army. This did happen after the clone wars with some separatists refusing to shut down. The empire just moved in vader  amp; the 501st stormtroopers to wipe them out.</TEXT>

    <TITLE>Wedding in early June, should we postpone/cancel now?</TITLE>
    <DATE>2020-03-23 21:50:34</DATE>
    <TEXT>Hi everyone. My partner and i had arranged for our wedding in early june. The number of people attending would be less than 80. The plan was to have the ceremony and reception at the same venue, which we have already paid 60% deposit for. The venue is in the macedon ranges area. Im asking if we should wait a few weeks to make our decision or make the decision now and postpone or cancel our wedding. I think that this virus isnt going to be contained by early june and we wouldn't be able to have a social gathering even if we wanted to. My other concern is that some of the businesses that we have paid deposits wont be in buisness if we postpone and we will never see those deposits. Another point is that id rather not spend that much money right when the economy is going to shit. We also have a honeymoon booked to go to northern queensland just after the wedding. I dont think we could travel if this virus is going to continue on its path. Should we cancel that too? Advice would be appreciated.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>No the solution is to manage the road, just like they are doing on the monash freeway. Specifically rate metering on the entry ramps to ensure the traffic joining doesnt force a jam on the main freeway. Just one person braking or changing lanes can set off an entire traffic jam. The higher the volume of traffic through a specific system the higher the chance of a catastrophic breakdown in traffic flow. there is a simple demonstration here https://traffic-simulation.de/</TEXT>

Sometimes its even possible to predict an enemy hab location by just being in contact with 3 enemies. A difference with 100player count and the change to radio bleed out is that its much harder to overrun habs and generally squads struggle to move when they hit contact. Its been an adjustment for sure.</TEXT>
