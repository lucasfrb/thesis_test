    <TITLE>Should chickens stay in cs comp?</TITLE>
    <DATE>2017-09-07 22:40:11</DATE>
    <TEXT>So over how ever long i've played the game i've seen so many outcomes change because of a chicken. From smokes not landing to doors opening the wrong way. So my question is should they be allowed to stay in the game when they're such a random thing that can change a whole game? Like imagine if it was 15-14 finals of a major and a team lost/won because of a chicken and not because of how they play that round.</TEXT>

    <TITLE>We need more gloves!!</TITLE>
    <DATE>2017-10-02 14:06:40</DATE>
    <TEXT>Most people dont really care much for gloves or knifes or skins, but as someone who has pretty much got everything they want for there csgo inventory (apart from my dream knife) i would quite like some new gloves to be added. Reasoning for this is because if they add new gloves i would think that the older gloves might get a little cheeper and also would be more affordable. Would also like to see some new brightly coloured gloves and better designs. Whats everyones thoughts on this.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>recently i went up against someone with perfect timing and they were super toxic and cocky. throughout the whole match i told my team that i thought he was just good and that you dont need to report him but after halftime someone on the enemy team said he has walls. after the game ended 14-16 i went to check if he was hacking by watching the demo but it wont let me download it. is this just something wrong with cs or did his hack not let me watch the demo? cheers</TEXT>

    <TEXT>football (in england anyway) doesnt have equal sides. you have a home side which takes up 3/4 of the stadium and an away team which takes up 1/4 of the stadium. ofc they only cheers for c9 cos most of them only support c9 why would they cheer for another team. ghosting and cheering is different but yes its annoying. im not going to down vote you cos im not annoyed at your opinion cos i think my opinion makes more sense tbh.</TEXT>

    <TITLE>C9 Cured My Depression</TITLE>
    <DATE>2018-01-29 17:08:49</DATE>
    <TEXT>Ive been a c9 supporter since ska first joined the roster. Since then c9 have done alright but theyve never really be respected that much, well thats how ive felt. For 2 years now ive had suicidal thoughts almost everyday and really been unhappy with my life. This Major (im from the uk btw) ive stayed up and watched every c9 game ,since most of there games started at like 9pm for me, and every game they won made me super happy. When they won last night i was so happy and watching ska on stream made me super happy for him. This morning i woke up and its one of the first times ive woken up in ages and been happy to get out of bed and do stuff like go to uni. Ive even signed up to go to the gym (cos i need to start wearing those tank tops ;) ). Bottom line is c9 winning the major made me happier than ive been in a while and i hope that they continue winning things and that i continue to get my life back together. Felt like i had to share this just cos im happy tbh XD</TEXT>

    <TEXT>And that's why it's trash epic care more about viewers than the tournament and the pros themselves. Every other eSport is doing it the other way around csgo players can customise almost everything to allow players to have the best experience and also have a spectator system in place so that when streaming it it's shown as native. Quake and TF2 are both the same. Even pubg has a better spectator mode. An eSport should be about players competing not about the views they're getting.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>my argument is based on the fact they are really fucking good. They have the best igl rn they have amazing fraggers an amazing awper thats easily in the top 3 awpers right now. Im saying i think they win based on what we have seen so far. Have liquid been amazing? Yes theyve been incredible and are imo the 2nd best team in the world. But i think astrailis are better right now based on what ive seen of both liquid and astrailis. I would like to know tbh why you think liquid will be the better team?

    <TEXT>Ive seen a lot of posts on here about hackers in mm and how they bought prime to avoid this but are still getting screwed over by hackers. I would suggest instead of buying prime either play free face it with anti-cheat on or even if you have the money buy a year or couple of months on face it. If people really are running into hackers that much then face it will be a much better experience. (Before you play face it ofc get use to the game etc as face it can be harder than mm a lot of the time for newer payers) Edit: some people are saying the jumping into face it is like playing against hackers because youre bad and that. 1 i didnt say go straight to face it i said get a feel for the game and then when youre confident enough go to face it. 2 playing against hackers vs playing against better players is completely diffrent. against hacker you have no chance you dont learn anything you just get destroyed, against better players you can learn. Maybe you see them throw a flash or peak an angle a certain way etc, against better players you learn and in turn get better yourself.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>There might be more cheaters in the game but with anti-cheat its 100% harder to cheat on face it servers than it is mm servers. After playing mm, face-it free, face it premium and esea i cant say ive ever noticed more toxic players in any of them tbh. There are always gonna be toxic players on csgo.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Ive had depression for going on 6 years now (I'm 19 for reference and I had a lot of family troubles at 13. I thought 2018 would be my last ever year on this earth untill I met my now girlfriend(21 y/o). She changed so much for me and really helped me get through new year's which was tough. Today I took her to meet my mum, step dad and 3 brothers (9,7,4 y/o) and it was great. We had a nice Sunday lunch and watched a film together and it was something I'd always wanted. But on the way home I now can't stop other thinking everything and I've ruined the day for myself. I won't be able to look back at this day as the perfect day and it's so frustrating. I just want to be able to be happy for one day so I can at least look back on it and remember a day of happiness.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>"Requires less skill" is such a dumb arguement, and a salty one at that tbh. In most games above mge I would say most people have the M4 spray down quite well so requiring skill doesn't really come into it all that much imo. The game also has never been balanced around the ak and the M4. This is easy to tell because the aug has had nothing change other than the price so it's not got any more powerful or anyworse in the last year interms of how it plays.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Op at 16 I failed all the exams I took and felt stupid af. It got to the point where my dad asked me to move out because he couldn't deal with me being so dumb. I'm 19 now and living in a flat with some mates and have just finished my 2nd year of uni. It takes time to find the things you're good at so don't worry if at 16 you haven't found them yet because you will eventually. As for being fat you can change that very easily but that's something only you can do. I wish you the best of luck man.  #128076; #127995;</TEXT>

I was bullied almost all my school life (now 19 out of school and am getting better) and by the end of it it ruined my tuition and left me with such bad depression that it's hard believe anyone actually wants to talk to me nowadays (even my girlfriend). Your daughter's a cunt. End of. This girl she has bullied is never going to forget it and will think about what they did day in and day out, and the worst part is your daughter's smart like you said and therefore it probably won't affect her in later life, but you can bet it she could have just ruined that other girls life.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>People always complain about the ranking system and i dont get why. If youre playing well and winning games youll rank up, if youre not carrying every game to the point of winning then youre prob where u need to be. Even if youre top scoring but not carrying then youre where you need to be. I find it hard to believe that you won all your games in a week and didnt rank up but if thats the case then youre prob where you need to be depending on how close the games were.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>if it is too easy then you will rank up from carrying, climbing out of silver can be hard but not if you carry. A tip i do have is silver tends to lack a lot of game sense and just be 1v1 gun fights. If you can improve your aim then youll win a lot more or on the other side you could improve your game sense (which is ofc harder to improve) and just outplay people.</TEXT>

    <DATE>2019-12-17 19:39:32</DATE>
    <TEXT>To give examples when i boot my pc everything is fine, untill discord (which i run in day/white mode) loads up and my screen turns black/off. I then have to CTRL ALT DEL to bring up something that isnt white on my screen so it turns back on, then when i go off it it goes back onto discord and the screen goes white again. After turning my pc off then on again it seems to fix it but happens like 50% of the time i boot my pc. I've started running discord in night/dark mode to counter this but then i get the same problem when i load up google chrome or when i flash banged in a video game. Anyone know anything that can help?</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Csgo is a unique game because of the learning curve. It's the same in tf2 with learning how their weapons/characters work. The thing that drives most people back to csgo/tf2 is the satisfaction you get when you kill someone and can see your improvement and can tell youre getting better. If you implicated this change not only would it mean that good players would just get better for no reason but starting players would either start to hate every other gun for not rewarding them with free kills like the 1-s or they would start not getting that stratification feeling when killing someone with it and thus maybe not caring about getting better. The m4a1-s is fine how it is because the recoil is super easy to control and it kills in a decent amount of time, the change to it having 25 bullets was all it needed to be used a little bit more.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Cheers for your response I think people forgot Reddit is for discussion sometimes and not for "your opinion and only yours" if u get me. As for your response I haven't seen much 2015 games unless it was top tier cs as that's when I first got into the game and didn't really watch anything lower than tier 1. It's interesting I guess I forgot that tiers affect a lot of factors and that trash talk would be one of them. It's definitely an "interesting match" for sure to watch though  #128517;</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Where does this end? Can we just have 10 man rosters and have them switch in between tournaments? Does this also mean they could buy players just to stop other teams using them? I don #8217;t like this  #8220;6 man team #8221; idea for the scene at all tbh I think it #8217;s quite unhealthy. Physical sports need people on the beach in case a players get hurt mid game, in eSports if someone is hurt you can just get a stand in like when people have visa issues.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Me and a friend started playing warhammer a month or so ago i ended up getting idomitus and he got a tau battleforce box. After seeing this and with it being payday another friend of ours bought the ork spearhead detachment ( #163;90) from our local game store. Ofc none of us really know too much about the game having only played 3/4 games each so my mate was wondering if the people of the ork subreddit could help him with picking out his next unit for 9th edition.
