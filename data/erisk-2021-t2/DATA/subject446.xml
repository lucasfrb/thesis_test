    <TITLE>friend can't join dark multiplayer server</TITLE>
    <DATE>2019-04-15 19:58:58</DATE>
    <TEXT>I made a dark multiplayer server yesterday for me to enjoy with my friend. However, I was able to join the session and play in it, but when my friend joins the server it says: "a connection attempt failed because the connected party did not respond correctly after a certain time, or the connection made failed because the connected host did not respond." I was wondering if anyone could help me with this? I was also wondering if someone else here would join the server to check if it works with another person instead of my friend to see if it's me or him. hit me up on discord: samson#4775 or just answer on this post.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Hello, my name is David and I'm currently looking for a unit since I left my old one. I live in the Netherlands (Timezone: CEST) I have been in two units so far, Semi-realism and milsim, which I both enjoyed. I enjoy playing infantry, but especially armored. So I'm looking for a unit which does missions using armor too. I'm 15 years so old, but I always act accordingly and mature. So if you need extra manpower or you're in a fun unit that I could join hit me up.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Hello, my name is David. pretty new to PC building. I just want to make a disclaimer: If I make any mistakes in the names of components or any other mistakes. please correct me but keep in mind I'm new to the PC world. Anyway, with that out of the way let me explain this for you guys. I first built my current PC a year ago with some help from a friend who's into PC building. I will state the components down below. Now that I've had my PC for a year I'm thinking about cleaning it up (better cable management, cleaning it, etc.) and replacing my GPU and adding extra RAM. I was wondering if there is anyone out there that would like to help me upgrade my pc and tell me if I should or should not replace certain parts. If you're interested add me on discord: **David Hey #5182.** current parts: motherboard: **MSI B360M PRO-VD** CPU: **Intel Core i5-8400** Memory: **DDR4 - 8GB -** (Single channel) GPU: **GeForce GTX 1050 Ti** Power supply: **Antec Neo ECO Classic NE550C**</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Hello there, My name is David. I have been interested in VFX for about a year now. I checked out all the different software but eventually decided that blender would be the best fit for me. I already have some experience with things like basic modeling, basic texturing(maps, etc.), basic physics and now I'd like to transfer those skills to blender. Is there anyone who could help me get into Blender without going into depth about the ultrabasic things, but more about the blender suite itself and where to find whicht tools, etc.</TEXT>

    <TITLE>Problems with cart on the mobile version of webshop.</TITLE>
    <DATE>2019-11-27 20:38:42</DATE>
    <TEXT>hi there, I was planning on launching my first Shopify store today until I realized that I had a couple of issues with the cart on the mobile version of my Shopify store. First off: the cart icon isn't showing in the Header which means that it's impossible for the customer to go to his or her cart without adding another item to their cart. second off: Whenever you add an item to the cart, you get linked to the search page, so you don't know if the item is added to the cart or not. which, again, is impossible seeing how you cant go to the cart to check if it was added or not. This is the website: [bottlechampion.com](https://bottlechampion.com) If you have time please check it out, thanks in advance. David my e-mail address is: david6heyl@gmail.com</TEXT>

    <TITLE>[Location update] [Amsterdam] Interesting locations and activities to visit and do in Amsterdam</TITLE>
    <DATE>2020-07-25 16:30:49</DATE>
    <TEXT>Hi, My name is David and I lived in Amsterdam for a good 13 years, and since I recently moved I thought I'd share some cool things to do or some cool places to visit when going to Amsterdam. 1. Eye Filmmuseum, the Eye Filmmuseum is a cool museum for people that like and are interested in film, and the cool thing about this museum is that it's for all ages and FREE until you're 18. The museum often has special exhibitions about famous and unfamous directors or filmmakers but also has sections with general information about the film and the history of cinema. 2. Moak, Moak is a pancake restaurant that serves delicious, exotic, and healthy pancakes. If you know a little about the Netherlands, you know that Pancake houses and restaurants aren't a new thing. But Moak is different. Moak has a variety of special pancakes that taste really good but are also really healthy. So if you're a real pancake fan and don't mind spending a lot of money for some good and exotic pancakes visit Moak 3. De Hallen, De De Hallen is a location in Amsterdam Nieuw-West in which you can spend the entire day. They have a cinema, marketplace, food court, and even a bike shop. Everything you'd need for a perfect day out. or the perfect date ;). The Hallen is a popular spot for locals to grab a bite to eat but also has tourists lurking around. If you're interested in culture and history De Hallen is also the perfect place for you. 4. Tony's Chocolonely store, Tony's Chocolonely is a famous dutch Chocolate brand that has (according to me) the best chocolate in the entirety of the Netherlands. Every person has a favorite flavor because there sure is a lot of them. The cool thing about Tony's Chocolonely is that it's made slave free and fair trade which is also the reason for the high price tag, but I and 43.176.336 other people don't really mind a high price for a slave-free and delicious chocolate bar. When you enter the Tony's Chocolonely shop it feels like you enter a tiny version of the Willy Wonka factory. With free and unlimited taste samples of 17 different and more limited edition flavored chocolate bars, and a machine in which you can create your OWN chocolate bar with your own ingredients and wrapper. This location is for the real chocolate freaks. 5. Rijksmuseum, Although this, is a very famous location for tourists to go to, I thought I'd mention it anyway. The Rijksmuseum is the most famous dutch museum with an inventory so large it covers the entire history of painted Netherlands and much more international work in certain exhibitions. The Rijksmuseum is perfect for people who like culture and paintings from the Dutch greats. 6. De Albert Heijn (De Appie), not local to Amsterdam is de Albert Heijn or as we say it: De Appie. De Albert Heijn is the famous dutch supermarket in which you can get all your favorite Dutch food and beverages. Although the assortment is not limited to dutch food only it sure has a lot of it 7. Klimmuur Amsterdam, if you're sporty and don't have a fear of heights, Klimmuur Amsterdam is perfect for you. A large climbing wall to spend a day with your friends on. Klimmuur Amsterdam is located close to Central station and the center of Amsterdam so you're sure to be able to grab a bite to eat after you can't move a muscle after you just did a good workout. Klimmuur Amsterdam also has a bouldering hall which is for the real climbers. So if you're into climbing sport or like to get sporty. Klimmuur Amsterdam is perfect for you. 8. Museumplein Schaatsbaan or Jaap Eden Baan (only during Winter), The Ice skating tracks which are widely visited by locals and tourists during winter are the ones on the Museumplein and the Jaap Eden baan. Although the Jaap Eden Baan is much bigger and more visited by locals, the track on the Museumplein has a better atmosphere (as we say in Dutch: Gezellig) and is more fun to go for a short period. These tracks are perfect if you want to go Ice Skating for a day and perfect to have a warm chocolade melk. 9. NEMO science museum, NEMO is the perfect place to go if you have smaller kids. A funny-looking building with a lot of interesting science, which frankly, is also really fun to do. From building dams to managing the logistics in a marble factory. Nemo science museum definitely has something that will amaze you. 10. Artis, Artis is the famous Zoo in Amsterdam which keeps you busy the entire day. With some exotic animals and a large collection of insects, it's the perfect place to go for an animal lover. Artis also has a lot of activities for families and children. So there's something for everyone. Artis is a classic zoo with a classic dutch twist to it. 11. De Kalverstraat, De Kalverstraat is a famous and certainly busy shopping street with a variety of all kinds of stores to choose from. Located in the center of Amsterdam, it's the perfect location to go to after one of these fun activities or interesting locations to grab a bite to eat. or to experience some local food like 'Patat.' De Kalverstraat is the perfect place to experience all the dutch and international shops and certainly has something for you. These are some of my favorite spots to go to when I'm in Amsterdam, and some interesting locations to visit when you're in Amsterdam. Although this was a large list. There are countless other cool things to do when you're in Amsterdam. Including some interesting ones. If you'd like to know some more spots or locations or have any other questions about Amsterdam for that matter, shoot me a PM. Thanks for reading.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Hi, how's everyone doing? Hopefully staying safe, I saw this map coming along containing a lot of information on where you are allowed to travel during this pandemic. Make sure you don't accidentally travel to Marocco because according to this map you're free to enter but once you're in you can't get out, haha.

    <TITLE>Some travel hacks and objects you could use when traveling through the Netherlands</TITLE>
    <DATE>2020-07-26 12:51:07</DATE>
    <TEXT>I recently posted a list with a bunch of things you could do while visiting Amsterdam. And realized how much points I put on that list, and with that how hard and **expensive** it would be to travel to all those places. So I thought I'd also share some things we do and use in the Netherlands to cut costs. I mean... I have to keep the stereotype that Dutch people are stingy high. **OV-chipkaart:** If you've ever traveled through the Netherlands you probably know [this card](https://imgur.com/a/Mmt0oVd). It's used at train stations and other public transports to pay. The OV-chipcard can easily be acquired at an NS-oplaadpunt and then used throughout your stay in the Netherlands. Just be careful you pick the right card due to the face that there are many options. And you don't want to end up with a 24-hour travel card instead of a good 'ol reliable OV-chipcard. You still have to put money on your card, but if you're in the Netherlands for a longer period of time you're definitely way cheaper off with an OV-Chipcard instead of those loose tickets every day. **A bike:** This one goes hand-in-hand with the OV-Chipcard but if you walk out of the train station you will immediately notice that 80% of the people who are outside are using bikes to get around. And so should you when you're in a city for a longer period of time. Bikes are a must-have when traveling in the city due to these reasons:- Easy to use- Fun to travel with- easy to park or store- Everyone uses a bike! It's really easy to get a bike in the city and there are countless ways to get your hands on a bike, but these are the easiest: If you already have your own OV-chipcard that is registered to your name (so not a nameless blue card) You can go to [NS.nl](https://NS.nl) \ gt; [Deur tot deur](https://www.ns.nl/webshop/nieuwproduct?0 amp;product=OFI amp;reisklasse=U amp;contractduur=DRLP amp;returnurl=http://www2.ns.nl/deur-tot-deur/ov-fiets/online-abonnee-worden.html) \ gt; [OV-Fiets](https://www.ns.nl/deur-tot-deur/ov-fiets). And you can charge the ability to hire OV-bikes at any station that offers them straight onto your card. And the beautiful thing about it: IT ONLY COSTS 0,01 Euros per year. Another method of hiring bikes in the city is by going to a bike rental shop like MacBike and renting a bike. Although this method is a lot more expensive it works. **A Powerbank:** I'm sure pretty much anyone knows what a power bank is and why it's so essential. I just thought I'd mention it anyway, letting you guys know that there are very few charging stations throughout cities, (pretty much none) So make sure you pack enough battery to last the entire day. **A bonus kaart**: When you go to the [Appie (Albert Heijn)](https://imgur.com/a/ioxHJwC), the most well-known supermarkets throughout the Netherlands. You'd be surprised how many discounts or combo deals there are, but if you go for one of those deals you'll quickly realize the at checkout there is no discount applied. Why is this? Well, it's important that you activate this discount or combo deal with a special (FREE) discount card called a bonus kaart. The cashiers won't tell you about it, because they usually apply the bonus themselves with a special card they have. but there are many incidents in which the cashiers let it slide and you're left with 4 packs of pasta for which you paid full price. Another benefit of having your own bonus kaart is that you'll get personalized discounts that no one else gets based on the products you buy. All you have to do to personalize your bonus kaart is to go to [AH.nl](https://AH.nl) \ gt; Bonuskaart and select Ik heb nog geen account (I don't have an account yet) To get some fresh deals. **A good stealing proof backpack**: It might surprise you that more than 88.000 crimes are committed in Amsterdam each year, and although this might scare you off. I'd say more than 90% of these crimes have to with tourists and travelers not paying attention to their personal belongings. So next time you go to a big city in the Netherlands watch your belongings and get a backpack that will keep the crooks and thieves out of your backpack. These are a couple of things that I would really keep in mind when traveling to the big Dutch cities, to ensure safety and to always come out cheapest ;)</TEXT>

    <TITLE>Good places to go when you visit Amsterdam.</TITLE>
    <DATE>2020-07-26 22:57:54</DATE>
    <TEXT>Hi, My name is David and I lived in Amsterdam for a good 13 years, and since I recently moved I thought I'd share some cool things to do or some cool places to visit when going to Amsterdam. 1. Eye Filmmuseum, the Eye Filmmuseum is a cool museum for people that like and are interested in film, and the cool thing about this museum is that it's for all ages and FREE until you're 18. The museum often has special exhibitions about famous and unfamous directors or filmmakers but also has sections with general information about the film and the history of cinema. 2. Moak, Moak is a pancake restaurant that serves delicious, exotic, and healthy pancakes. If you know a little about the Netherlands, you know that Pancake houses and restaurants aren't a new thing. But Moak is different. Moak has a variety of special pancakes that taste really good but are also really healthy. So if you're a real pancake fan and don't mind spending a lot of money for some good and exotic pancakes visit Moak 3. De Hallen, De De Hallen is a location in Amsterdam Nieuw-West in which you can spend the entire day. They have a cinema, marketplace, food court, and even a bike shop. Everything you'd need for a perfect day out. or the perfect date ;). The Hallen is a popular spot for locals to grab a bite to eat but also has tourists lurking around. If you're interested in culture and history De Hallen is also the perfect place for you. 4. Tony's Chocolonely store, Tony's Chocolonely is a famous dutch Chocolate brand that has (according to me) the best chocolate in the entirety of the Netherlands. Every person has a favorite flavor because there sure is a lot of them. The cool thing about Tony's Chocolonely is that it's made slave free and fair trade which is also the reason for the high price tag, but I and 43.176.336 other people don't really mind a high price for a slave-free and delicious chocolate bar. When you enter the Tony's Chocolonely shop it feels like you enter a tiny version of the Willy Wonka factory. With free and unlimited taste samples of 17 different and more limited edition flavored chocolate bars, and a machine in which you can create your OWN chocolate bar with your own ingredients and wrapper. This location is for the real chocolate freaks. 5. Rijksmuseum, Although this, is a very famous location for tourists to go to, I thought I'd mention it anyway. The Rijksmuseum is the most famous dutch museum with an inventory so large it covers the entire history of painted Netherlands and much more international work in certain exhibitions. The Rijksmuseum is perfect for people who like culture and paintings from the Dutch greats. 6. De Albert Heijn (De Appie), not local to Amsterdam is de Albert Heijn or as we say it: De Appie. De Albert Heijn is the famous dutch supermarket in which you can get all your favorite Dutch food and beverages. Although the assortment is not limited to dutch food only it sure has a lot of it 7. Klimmuur Amsterdam, if you're sporty and don't have a fear of heights, Klimmuur Amsterdam is perfect for you. A large climbing wall to spend a day with your friends on. Klimmuur Amsterdam is located close to Central station and the center of Amsterdam so you're sure to be able to grab a bite to eat after you can't move a muscle after you just did a good workout. Klimmuur Amsterdam also has a bouldering hall which is for the real climbers. So if you're into climbing sport or like to get sporty. Klimmuur Amsterdam is perfect for you. 8. Museumplein Schaatsbaan or Jaap Eden Baan (only during Winter), The Ice skating tracks which are widely visited by locals and tourists during winter are the ones on the Museumplein and the Jaap Eden baan. Although the Jaap Eden Baan is much bigger and more visited by locals, the track on the Museumplein has a better atmosphere (as we say in Dutch: Gezellig) and is more fun to go for a short period. These tracks are perfect if you want to go Ice Skating for a day and perfect to have a warm chocolade melk. 9. NEMO science museum, NEMO is the perfect place to go if you have smaller kids. A funny-looking building with a lot of interesting science, which frankly, is also really fun to do. From building dams to managing the logistics in a marble factory. Nemo science museum definitely has something that will amaze you. 10. Artis, Artis is the famous Zoo in Amsterdam which keeps you busy the entire day. With some exotic animals and a large collection of insects, it's the perfect place to go for an animal lover. Artis also has a lot of activities for families and children. So there's something for everyone. Artis is a classic zoo with a classic dutch twist to it. 11. De Kalverstraat, De Kalverstraat is a famous and certainly busy shopping street with a variety of all kinds of stores to choose from. Located in the center of Amsterdam, it's the perfect location to go to after one of these fun activities or interesting locations to grab a bite to eat. or to experience some local food like 'Patat.' De Kalverstraat is the perfect place to experience all the dutch and international shops and certainly has something for you. These are some of my favorite spots to go to when I'm in Amsterdam, and some interesting locations to visit when you're in Amsterdam. Although this was a large list. There are countless other cool things to do when you're in Amsterdam. Including some interesting ones. If you'd like to know some more spots or locations or have any other questions about Amsterdam for that matter, shoot me a PM, or visit our travel subreddit" r/Travelupdates Thanks for reading.</TEXT>

    <TITLE>Cool places I've been to this year 2019-2020, with pictures and google map links</TITLE>
    <DATE>2020-07-27 14:59:45</DATE>
    <TEXT>I #8217;ve visited some cool places this (and last) year. And thought I #8217;d share some pictures with some information with it. I #8217;ve linked to my journey or location on google maps so you can go to that exact spot if you ever plan on going there. Hope you enjoy it. Here is the link to the google map:[https://www.google.com/maps/d/edit?mid=1akFbcpQCEKPX9HUUxlctBR\_cwP1roxfH amp;usp=sharing](https://www.google.com/maps/d/edit?mid=1akFbcpQCEKPX9HUUxlctBR_cwP1roxfH amp;usp=sharing) *Port of Rotterdam:* The port of Rotterdam is where most goods in the Netherlands arrive. And let me tell you. The port of Rotterdam is BIG! The 11th largest port in the world, and still expanding. The cool thing about the Port of Rotterdam is that they #8217;re very open to visitors and share a lot of cool information on the pot itself. What I did when I was there was go on a boat and travel around the newest part of the port called:  #8216;De Nieuwe Maasvlakte. #8217; It #8217;s this big piece of land that was reclaimed from the sea. Something we Dutch people are very good at.As I went around on the boat tour they showed some amazing things and constructions that you wouldn #8217;t believe were actually men made. *Sardinia:* Last year I went to Sardinia one of the islands off the coast of Italy. It was a beautiful place with some amazing spots and views. I did as much traveling around as I could. And I found some really cool places of which I luckily took some pictures. I do have to say that once you reach some higher points on the island and can see almost out to sea. You do get the feeling that you #8217;re on a massive rock, which is a funny, but a weird feeling. *Ireland:* Also Last year I went to Ireland and did a grand road trip along the east, north, and west coast of Ireland. And it was a trip that I won't forget soon. All the traveling I did was pre-planned and by public transport, and let me tell you, that was a real adventure on its own. Making sure you catch the train so you don #8217;t have to wait another 6 hours to take you to some outskirts of Ireland was fun and exciting, and I really encourage you guys to do it yourselves. In the beginning, I pretty much visited big cities like Dublin and Belfast, but I gradually started visiting more places along the coast or land inwards. I made a nice long biking trip along the coast once and took a long bus to the Giant #8217;s causeway which I #8217;m sure some of you might know. Overall it was a great experience with enough balance between tourist attractions and exploration on my own. *Greece:* At the end of last year, I went to Greece to sail with family and friends, something we do each year, to flee the start of the winter as real migration birds, to enjoy the last bits of warmth. We usually do a long journey along a certain part of the coast, and that #8217;s exactly what we did last year, the only difference was that we ended up in Athens. A beautiful and large city full of life and hidden ancient culture. So If you #8217;re into finding hidden-away buildings that were there before the birth of Jesus, Athens is certainly for you. Just like in the other bits I #8217;ve linked to some pictures and located the spots and my journey on google maps so you can see where I took my photos if you ever go there. I hope you liked this and might use it when you go to visit these places yourself someday</TEXT>

    <TITLE>Favorite Dutch food (Look out for these when on vacation in the Netherlands)</TITLE>
    <DATE>2020-07-28 15:46:20</DATE>
    <TEXT>As many of you might know now, I am Dutch, and let me tell you we Dutch people have a lot of good food that you wouldn't normally be able to get anywhere else on the world without doing some really searching. So this is a list of foods you should definitely look out for next time you visit the Netherlands. [**Oliebol**](https://www.google.com/search?q=Oliebol. amp;source=lnms amp;tbm=isch amp;sa=X amp;ved=2ahUKEwidmLa8pPDqAhVSwKQKHW-MBQIQ_AUoAXoECBQQAw amp;biw=1920 amp;bih=937) The famous Dutch Oliebol, which translates into: 'OilBall' is a delicious snack that you can only get when you visit during the winter. The preparation of an Oliebol is actually very simple but the taste is really good. An Oliebol is practically just donut dough made into a ball and then fried until the outside is brown. But this is not where it normally stops. Many people decide to put a little bit of Poedersuiker (Powdered sugar) over it and that really finishes it off, or if you want to go for the real traditional Oliebol you have to put raisins in the dough before frying. This snack is for the people that really enjoy a warm "snack" during the winter. [**Stroopwafel**](https://www.google.com/search?q=Stroopwafel amp;tbm=isch amp;ved=2ahUKEwj-pqG9pPDqAhXRt6QKHQ-2B58Q2-cCegQIABAA amp;oq=Stroopwafel amp;gs_lcp=CgNpbWcQAzIFCAAQsQMyAggAMgIIADICCAAyAggAMgIIADICCAAyAggAMgIIADICCAA6BAgAEENQ61xYumhg8mloAHAAeACAATqIAe8DkgECMTGYAQCgAQGqAQtnd3Mtd2l6LWltZ8ABAQ amp;sclient=img amp;ei=R0cgX77nNNHvkgWP7J74CQ amp;bih=937 amp;biw=1920#imgrc=9iefrgQJXUcxxM) Some of you might already know this one. Seeing how the Stroopwafel has made its presence on some international occasions, but for those of you who don't know this one let me explain. A stroopwafel is literally what it translates into A syrup waffle. And let me tell you a nice warm Stroopwafel during the afternoon is the real dream. You can buy these in the general supermarkets with all kinds of flavors: Chocolate, salted, etc. but the real Strooopwafel is the one you can get on the market at a [Stroopwafel stand](https://www.google.com/search?q=Stroopwafel+kraam+op+markt amp;tbm=isch amp;ved=2ahUKEwiTnZzEpPDqAhVRPOwKHSj2A1oQ2-cCegQIABAA amp;oq=Stroopwafel+kraam+op+markt amp;gs_lcp=CgNpbWcQAzoCCAA6BAgAEEM6BggAEAgQHjoECAAQGDoGCAAQChAYOgQIABAeUJ9lWIF9YN99aAJwAHgAgAE9iAHDBZIBAjE1mAEAoAEBqgELZ3dzLXdpei1pbWfAAQE amp;sclient=img amp;ei=VkcgX5OaHNH4sAeo7I_QBQ amp;bih=937 amp;biw=1920#imgrc=qHK1zU_6sMrjjM) who make one live for you right there, where the syrup drips from the waffle into your napkin.

    <TITLE>Good foods to look out for when visiting the Netherlands</TITLE>
    <DATE>2020-07-28 15:50:16</DATE>
    <TEXT>I am Dutch, and let me tell you we Dutch people have a lot of good food that you wouldn't normally be able to get anywhere else on the world without doing some real searching. So this is a list of foods you should definitely look out for next time you visit the Netherlands. [**Oliebol**](https://www.google.com/search?q=Oliebol. amp;source=lnms amp;tbm=isch amp;sa=X amp;ved=2ahUKEwidmLa8pPDqAhVSwKQKHW-MBQIQ_AUoAXoECBQQAw amp;biw=1920 amp;bih=937) The famous Dutch Oliebol, which translates into: 'OilBall' is a delicious snack that you can only get when you visit during the winter. The preparation of an Oliebol is actually very simple but the taste is really good. An Oliebol is practically just donut dough made into a ball and then fried until the outside is brown. But this is not where it normally stops. Many people decide to put a little bit of Poedersuiker (Powdered sugar) over it and that really finishes it off, or if you want to go for the real traditional Oliebol you have to put raisins in the dough before frying. This snack is for the people that really enjoy a warm "snack" during the winter.

[**Stamppot**](https://www.google.com/search?q=Stamppot amp;tbm=isch amp;ved=2ahUKEwjYnJeApfDqAhVZgqQKHZEBCXQQ2-cCegQIABAA amp;oq=Stamppot amp;gs_lcp=CgNpbWcQAzIFCAAQsQMyAggAMgIIADICCAAyAggAMgIIADICCAAyAggAMgIIADICCAA6BAgAEEM6BwgAELEDEENQxWRYunFgnXJoAHAAeACAAT2IAacDkgEBOJgBAKABAaoBC2d3cy13aXotaW1nwAEB amp;sclient=img amp;ei=1EcgX9jiDNmEkgWRg6SgBw amp;bih=937 amp;biw=1920#imgrc=cU6zFh-luHJkjM) Just like the Oliebol is this something you won't see much unless you visit during the winter. When everyone is crawled up in their homes and is enjoying the warmth and coziness of their thermostat while it's snowing outside. During these times Dutch people resort to some of our favorite dishes: Zuurkol, Boerenkool, hotspot, and many more. Which all can be names Stamppot, a collective name. Stamppot is usually a big casserole type of dish made with not more than four or five ingredients, but every Stamppot must have potatoes and a Kankworst (Big sausage). [**Een bakje met nootjes**](https://www.google.com/search?q=Borrelnootjes amp;tbm=isch amp;ved=2ahUKEwjd3ryTpfDqAhUTkaQKHRv0BK8Q2-cCegQIABAA amp;oq=Borrelnootjes amp;gs_lcp=CgNpbWcQAzICCAAyAggAMgIIADICCAAyAggAMgIIADICCAAyAggAMgIIADICCAA6BQgAELEDOgQIABBDUKloWLZ2YPN2aABwAHgAgAFBiAHSBJIBAjEzmAEAoAEBqgELZ3dzLXdpei1pbWfAAQE amp;sclient=img amp;ei=_EcgX93wKJOikgWb6JP4Cg amp;bih=937 amp;biw=1920#imgrc=BDcrL4bES4vjVM) Last not but least Een bakje met nootjes (A bowl with nuts). Every Dutch bar or restaurant has one at its bar. A dirty glass bowl filled to the brim with peanuts or borrelnootjes (Peanuts in a crusty coat), It's not usually something you'd order but you grab a couple when you leave the bar after you ordered some drinks. The dirty side about this is that you're of course not the only one that grabbed a couple of nootjes when you went to grab a drink, and the people that run the place aren't switching the bowl out just because you grabbed a few. So when you do go to a Dutch bar make sure you NEVER go for the last borrelnootjes or peanuts at the bottom of the bowl, unless you want three types of diseases. Well, this was a list filled with some of my favorite and some weird food we eat here in the Netherlands and that you should definitely try out when you come here. I hope you enjoyed the list, and keep in mind to never go for the last borrelnootjes.

    <TITLE>What's it like traveling on a sailing yacht</TITLE>
    <DATE>2020-08-01 15:35:40</DATE>
    <TEXT>I love sailing, and especially on a larger boat (a sailing yacht). I go sailing every year with friends and family on a large sailing yacht in Greece. We usually just drift around because the wind is usually very calm along the east coast, but on the days when the wind goes wild, we have a lot of fun. So I thought I explained what it's like to travel on a large sailing yacht for the people that would perhaps like to go sailing or to people that are generally just interested. As mentioned earlier sailing on a large yacht is very different from traveling regularly with a normal yacht or boat due to the fact that every day can be different. One day you're going 3 knots with the engine on while enjoying the sun on the deck. but Another day you could be sailing 11 knots through a minor storm with the boat going oblique. Because of that sailing truly is a really fun thing to do, you never know what you're doing the next few days depending on how the weather turns out. but you do know that it'll always be fun. What's also really different from sitting at home versus sailing is performing normal tasks or just living in general. If you go sailing for a week or two you can easily just bring enough clothes with you, I mean, it's not like you're at some fancy meeting, so you could be wearing the same shirt the entire week. but whenever you go sailing for a longer period of time. You'll have to wash your clothes each time you go ashore or using freshwater aboard the ship which can also be a real challenge. Especially on the days where the boat goes really slow. Because you go so slow the boat will go back and forth between the waves when on open water. So when you're inside the cabin you're bound to fall over at least twice. I once got so seasick when staying inside the cabin that I wanted to throw up, but a person was blocking the entrance and exit from the cabin so I threw up all over him :(. You probably shouldn't be eating while reading this post. One of the fun things besides actually sailing is going ashore whether this is in the port or a quiet bay on some island (Which are usually a lot more fun). You can leave whenever you want and can sleep on the boat. So you don't have to check out early and can leave whenever you want (which usually still is quite early depending on where you want to go that day.) If you're staying in a quiet bay you're even more free to do anything you want. You can explore freely on land or go swimming with the fish. Your choice.  #8203; In the end, going sailing on a big yacht is not something you can do each month and is very expensive. But if you save up some money and travel with a person who has enough experience in sailing you're sure to have a beautiful journey.</TEXT>

That same day I also ate a lot of soup and didn #8217;t drink enough water. The entire time I was just fine but when I went down into the cabin and couldnt see the horizon and see how the ship moved I turned in an instant</TEXT>
