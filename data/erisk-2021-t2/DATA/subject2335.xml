    <TEXT>Yep those are some wise words! I also cut out all of my friends - Its certainly made my emotions stable but im torn between wanting to believe that because of that reason its a good thing but also whether it could be a bad thing as its less functional, or whether in fact being less functional is always a bad thing/could be a good thing in certain circumstances. Hows your relationship with the mental health services in your area?</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Congrats on managing to finish it! Often that kind of stop-start can be the hardest to manage and requires many sturdy personality qualities in order to see it through, so theres definitely some positives you can take from that experience whether its your resilience or the actual impact of the full CBT course itself. Feel free to post about your experiences with your local mental health team or any specific services you've found useful if you wish to share at any point in future. It sounds to me like you've recieved a service thats not been all bad, so thats reassuring. Good luck with your next meeting too  #128578;</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Sorry that you've had to experience that - I can really relate with that type of experience too. I think its all too common here in the UK..I often hear about how easy it can be to recieve necessary diagnosis or immediate inpatient care in other countries in comparison and although there may be a cost, its its not going to be as costly as a life. Do you feel in control of/content with your Ayahuasca useage at the moment? In my master post I included a number for narcotics anonymous if its something you wanted any help with. I'm glad you've got it figured out and have some strong hobbies there - they're something that can be pursued to quite an extent plus distraction can be a very useful technique</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Sorry to hear you've had a tough time with the services whilst growing up. I can certainly relate though as I have been struggling to get a diagnosis to help guide me in a better direction for quite a few years too. From my personal experience you'll likely find that they only want to address the symptoms youre experiencing rather than being clear about a diagnosis, so I wouldn't go into the meeting expecting you'll find one or you may end up feeling more lost/disappointed etc. If youre honest about your symptoms though then they'll be able to figure out which medication might suit you better  #128578;</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Hey there, sorry that you've found yourself in this situation and that nothing has worked for your boyfriend yet. Where are are you living? How is your boyfriend like with interacting with others? If he's still able to do that then perhaps theres a local type of activity group where he can be around others in a non clinical setting, whilst getting a break from the job searching and being able to explore different skills without immense pressure. I used to have to deal with really bad depression which resonates with some of the things you've told me about your boyfriend and I only found one thing that worked. Basically, at night I would fill my next day up so I'd use a note app on my phone and type out '9am-10am: breakfast' '10am-10 30am: shower' etc until I had a plan for the next day. I think it subconsciously made me feel like I had a purpose and stopped me ruminating so much due to boredom and depression because I knew there was always something I should be doing..its not something for everyone but maybe worth a try  #128578;</TEXT>

    <TEXT>There is one idea that I can think of which you could pursue. You could make an appointment with your boyfriend to go to the GP and for you to ask how he can be assessed by social services for what is called a 'personal budget' - you may (like I did) think that this is only applicable to people with severe learning disabilities but its not. It may be possible to contact your council directly but I think they'd require a medical assessment having been done first. [Have a read about the personal budget and things related to that here](https://www.disabilityrightsuk.org/personal-budgetsthe-right-social-care-support). There is also this to check out specifically concerning [assessment, eligibility and support planning](https://www.disabilityrightsuk.org/assessment-eligibility-and-support-planning). All you can do is try to be there to take steps with him, to reiterate that getting support is actually a proactive step and that slow progress is still progress  #128578;</TEXT>

    <TEXT>That sounds like a terrible experience so its understandable that you feel the way you're feeling about it. I can definitely relate as I've had a lot of bad experiences myself..a good way to deal with that is asking yourself: 'Would I think it was worth the risk of trusting them again if the next person happened to be one of the good ones?' As all it takes is for one person to be helpful and it can change a life or perspective. I think it'll be worth enquiring about with your GP but im unsure of how that might work out in ROI specifically. If you feel able to apply for a part time job then go for it while you're able to - it may offer a welcome distraction from the medical frustrations you're currently having</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Yeah, definitely go with whats been recommended by your psychiatrist. It might not be what you want to hear but it might also be reassuring in a way, that I think in all but very extreme cases they just seem to give very low points blanket style and make you work to prove which points you need on top to meet the criteria, especially as there's bonuses involved for them towing the line. Take it in your stride though, you'll either get it awarded or you'll get a chance to strengthen your case to be viewed by people without a bias and who will make sure you get backpay.

    <TEXT>Hi there! In terms of dealing with specific symptoms I would suggest going to your GP who can refer you to your local mental health team and can get actual therapy through that avenue. As im sure you'll already be aware though - the waiting lists are quite lengthy. Its worth getting the ball rolling though if you feel unable to deal with your moods by yourself and are perhaps stuck in a vicious cycle. In the meantime, there are certain phone apps which are recommended if you feel suited to a less medicalised route. I know at least through the play store on my android there are highly rated apps such as: '10% happier: meditation for fidgety skeptics' and 'headspace: meditation and sleep' (which was actually recommended on a letter from my local mental health team while waiting).</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Maybe my personal experience with this a couple of years ago may help you...I went to the doctors about my mental health symptoms I was experiencing and he said to me along the lines of 'I think you should be prescribed something but the mental health team doesn't like us doing that without the person having been assessed by a psychiatrist'. I'm not sure whether that was due to my symptoms being complex or whether thats something thats generally seen as being above their pay grade so-to-speak. [This article from 2015 on the mind website goes some way to explaining the situation](https://www.mind.org.uk/news-campaigns/news/gps-and-practice-nurses-aren-t-getting-enough-mental-health-training/)  gt; Data obtained by the mental health charity shows that in England, on average, less than half (46 per cent) of trainee GPs undertook a training placement in a mental health setting.  gt; Furthermore, the only mental health-related option offered to trainee GPs was in psychiatry, which is based in hospitals and secondary care-focussed.</TEXT>

Stress can certainly bring about unstable emotions including paranoia and anger (which can often come along directly as a result of the paranoia). I definitely experience emotions like these which often naturally occur together as a result of each other but it's a long term thing relating to complex mental health disorders - its just sometimes its more relative to a current situation vs long term mental health disorders</TEXT>

If its any consolation, I also had an experience with a particular service within NHS mental health and they were desperate to get out of the meeting. They basically just told me everything they couldnt do rather than anything they could, said theyd refer me elsewhere then literally walked out lol. Unfortunately although you're clearly deserving of help, you hit the nail on the head. If you come across like you dont need help then they will wash their hands of you asap. You need to think of it like applying for a disability benefit, where you have to lay it on thick and explain your bad periods as if they were some of the worst you've ever had to get any help. Are you able to identify what kind of help/support you need or a little unsure?</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Thats a pretty difficult situation to be in, the best you can do is to just keep some kind of regular contact with him and if he does do something which lands him in a dangerous situation (and you're aware of it at the time) then call for an ambulance and explain that its due to out of control mental health issues - it'll be the best opportunity for him to be given help. In my personal experience police have been awful and they're often not trained enough in mental health issues to care or deal with it properly and the person you care about may be left to go crazy in a cell for up to 24hrs, leaving them with worse issues. At this point theres nothing to lose in calling the non emergency line 111 for advice or contact your local MIND charity - they may have come across your situation a fair number of times before Edit: Also there's jo@samaritans.org if you prefer not talking about it on the phone.</TEXT>

Do you feel that you quite specifically still struggle with the grief that seemed to have brought on this period of anxiety, suicidal ideation etc? If it is still bothering you, do you feel just talking to someone may help you, or perhaps another thing might help more? If these feelings have stemmed from the grief then being able to address that would then likely address the other issues you're having, whereas if you just addressed the anxiety and suicidal ideation as standalone issues, then it likely wont work out as well because the underlying grief issue would still remain as strong.</TEXT>

So perhaps a domino effect rather than a very straight direct link from the underlying issue to the worst state you're in now.

    <TEXT>Hi there! I can really relate with struggling to get an official diagnosis, its been so frustrating spending over a decade trying to figure out whats up in order to get the right treatment when it seems so many others around me are much easier understood and have direction. Unfortunately professionals in the NHS have somewhat recently taken a turn and decided its best to treat symptoms rather than give somebody a label - which is understandable for short term issues but incredibly frustrating for those whose lives have been badly hindered by their issues. The only way to really address that promptly would be to pay to see a psychiatrist for an assessment (only has to be one payment but is expensive and not always 100% due to them not knowing you long term). Do you have any goals or ambitions? If there was something out there which happened to knock those issues on the head, where would you want to go from there? It may seem a million miles away but finding out what will drive you is certainly a good start - even if that means needing to explore (online or in person) in order to discover what direction you would like to go in/what your end game is etc</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Yeah you can just google 'private psychiatrists -your area-' and enquire through email or phone call to see the price for a standard assessment which I think is 1hr 30 mins and very thorough. You may still need to go to your GP to be 'referred' but as you're paying they just ask you why you want to go private so its much less gatekeepy. Yeah I'm definitely with you on the issue of not knowing what the bigger picture is which could undermine any treatment of singular symptoms without wider context. I think at this point you'll only get a chance of that specific clarity by paying for a private assessment unfortunately. Perhaps that clarity would make you feel more clearer minded or confident about the direction you wish to go in, or make that transition easier for you so that you can pursue that lifestyle you're wishing for currently - It's amazing what a change of perspective can do and where it can take you! No need to feel silly for it though, some people are genuinely happy working on the tills in a supermarket because its something that suits them which makes them happier - in this social media age its easy to compare ourselves with each other and it can feel like you need to change the world to not be silly or lesser etc but as long as you're aiming for something that suits you personally, it'll make you more content which is the aim, even if its not the same thing that'll make someone else content</TEXT>

If you're purely looking to top up your money while you look for a transition without taking too much time out, [then given your circumstances you could be eligible for income support though im not 100% sure](https://www.gov.uk/income-support) EDIT: it looks like the qualifying criteria for income support has been tightened up, maybe someone else will come up with something im not aware of but it looks like your best option would probably be to apply for universal credit so that it can cover you at least if you cant find work before the SSP ends</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Hi there! Sorry to hear about your situation, it's not right that youre having to live like this. This might be a stupid question but have you tried searching for local charities which may advocate for people with disabilities? Which area are you in? (Roughly - if you wish to share). I dont know whether you've got into a hopeless state and its perhaps enabling you to overlook something which may help, or whether theres simply nothing out there for you - I'd like to think there's somehow something that can give you the support you need. Have you spoken to your local council?</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Hey there, sorry to hear about all of those failings you've had to endure! Unfortunately it is now increasingly common for NHS mental health psychiatrists etc to offer to treat symptoms as opposed to giving people a diagnosis - I guess they fear that a label will harm people but dont seem to realise how much more harm it can do for those with long term unresolved issues where the person effected has no real clarity. The best option would be to see a psychiatrist privately for an assessment once youre able to afford it as they will give you a diagnosis. Also, whoever told you there is no treatment for BPD is wrong - there are specific therapies which can help BPD but of course where money/cost is involved they're likely to be resistant to help [Have you heard of a charity called changing lives?](https://www.changing-lives.org.uk/services/housing-homelessness/).

    <TEXT>There's no way that I'm aware of which would enable a fast track diagnosis via the NHS. I just think it's a shift in policy and mentality now that they dont really diagnose unless someone is a persistent extreme danger to themselves and others with a very obvious issue they can pinpoint. It's really shitty that you've had such little support and have been told false things from people. Definitely give that charity a contact because they state they help people who are at risk of homelessness and the sooner you tell them the sooner they can potentially help - I'm sure they've dealt with many similar cases before so they're the best ones to try for now as they may be able to point you in the right direction with things like money too.</TEXT>

One way you could get round that is to go to the council and say that youre homeless (bonus points if your parent/s can tell that to the council or if you have vulnerabilities such as mental health issues - debt could count too). The only issue is that you may have to be put somewhere temporary which could be worse than your current situation depending on your opinion, itd also cause a bit of stress with potential benefits if you recieve them but if you are receiving housing benefits then it'd also be a cheap way of living.

There certainly is hope out there, you can get further in life with obtainable/workable qualities such as determination, enthusiasm, flexibility, persistence etc rather than just needing GCSEs. I know those are difficult when depressed but my point is that they're things which can be developed or worked on rather than something which is either there or isn't (which can feel that way when quite depressed). Its an easier starting point when associating them with a hobby or goal though. You're doing well in *your* journey though, look at the freedom you have after therapy compared to before it, now imagine how much more that'll be bettered with another lot of therapy! Its just about considering what is the best way to fill time in order to distract yourself from the negative thoughts. It can be helpful to view those negative thoughts as proof of progress though, as with anxiety related issues theyre often a response to feeling fearful due to progressing/doing well with anxiety which can be overwhelming. I'd definitely advise to keep maintaing your little drives and walks as they help to keep the momentum going  #128578;</TEXT>

I didnt really think it was all that rare for babies to be taken into care or for there to be extra support in place for vulnerable families in order to raise their baby themselves, providing the woman wants to give birth to the child. I don't really see why it's necessary for her to be forced into this when it appears there are better ways to work around the issue in this case. As you say, it's uneasy how much power authorities can have over us even if its detrimental and sets a bit of an unfortunate precedent/example in a time where we are still trying to reduce stigma around mental health issues</TEXT>

It sounds to me that your experience is likely due to them treating you a certain way because of having BPD - it really is a tough one to have to manage without having others adding to sterotypes and the stigma.

    <TEXT>Yeah I can relate with you there, it's almost like the less somebody knows about the condition the better, which is wrong. It feels like when people (professionals) are very aware of BPD then its easy for them to actually gaslight you because of manipulation being associated with BPD. I just muddle by with my issues really, luckily I have many issues and am impacted more by issues other than BPD so that enables me to be taken more seriously than the people like you who truly and utterly get the BPD cold shoulder! I know your bad experience with the professionals wont help but are you downplaying your issues with them? Do you think if you were outright honest that it would enable them to go down the intervention route? Dont forget theres always the ability to make a complaint about any NHS treatment/service recieved [which is explained here](https://www.nhs.uk/using-the-nhs/about-the-nhs/how-to-complain-to-the-nhs/).

    <TEXT>If you have the money available then you may benefit from a one-off assessment from a private psychiatrist, someone who is just meeting you afresh without being swayed by the BPD label before meeting you. Psychs in the NHS will always have that bias due to seeing your records first. That could help clarify whether it is or isnt BPD or whether its that and something else, clarity is a pretty underrated great feeling! Is there any hobbies that you're able to get enjoyment out of still? Any current goals? (Even if it seems far off). Unfortunately with crisis intervention its only usually useful for someone who is literally about to commit suicide due to how short term it is, all the services chaos and emotional chaos involved etc. Sometimes our feeling of lack of control due to our unstable emotions can make us feel like we have no control over *anything* rather than just our emotions which leaves us reliant on a service which can mishandle us and perpetuate the out of control feeling. The best thing, if possible, is to identify what aspects of your life you can currently control and how best you'll be able to achieve that, even if you then need support in order to get there or if it's done slowly - slow progress is still progress  #128578;</TEXT>

Maybe eventually it'll open up some doors for you so that you're able to access more reliable/less judgemental support or set you in a mind frame where you have more confidence in regaining that control through certain techniques that work for you. Just remind yourself that you're worthy of the support and that its there for people such as yourself..the people in the wrong are the ones for pidgeon-holing you based on a diagnosis, not you for trying to get the support thats designed to help people who are experiencing issues.

I have personally forked out to see a psychiatrist before and whilst they were helpful with being quite thorough, I'm not sure whether seeing a psychologist vs a psychiatrist would be best for you. Many psychiatrists are a fan of chucking medications at people whether they can pinpoint a diagnosis or not, whether the side effects are terrible or not. If you have the spare money then itd be a great happy medium to have an assessment with a psychiatrist and then some with a psychologist, but I've personally found psychologists far more helpful because they can see beyond medication as the only solution to every problem so it can be quite enlightening  #128578;</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Hey, I know exactly what you mean as I'm often someone who floats in that grey area. I guess it's about working out what kind of support would be best suited to you/what you need right now as to which would be the best course of action to take. I would say that it's probably best to try to focus on how best to avoid becoming severe and to find strategies where you're able to rely less on people who may not be very dependable (certain mental health services etc) which will then aggravate things more. Do you have any current interests or coping strategies?</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Perhaps its a silly question but is there any way in which you would be able to incorporate them into your current lifestyle, even if its just partly rather than directly/specifically related? Im not sure how your specific issues impact you but it might be worth me mentioning that I experience quite bad mood swings alongside anhedonia, for me I always used to hate the contrast and contradiction and be focused on that but I overlooked that during those mood swings I was actually able/more capable of having more of a life/going outside of a basic pattern which I could then really take advantage of in order to preserve the interest for when I started drifting back to a more anhedonic state. Sorry about the circumstances though, its so frustrating that theres such a lack of investment into the long term help for mental health issues in order to stem persistent cyclical issues!</TEXT>

    <TEXT>No problem! Sounds very difficult as I can go through these phases myself which can seem like hitting a brick wall repeatedly for everyone involved! You could pay for a one off psychiatrist assessment which means they have to diagnose and come up with a plan, which if its serious, which involve him/her referring on to the crisis team or something similar but with his/her view which adds leverage. Probably looking at around  #163;200 though depending on area but its a one-off cost</TEXT>

Some things are easiest just waited out but if you're nervous it cant wait then you could explain that its about seeing someone who has never met her and therefore has a fresh opinion on her. To me it sounds like psychotic behaviour so the quicker its dealt with the better but try to bite your lip for now so-to-speak, as any negative reactions from you could be played into the paranoia</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Thanks for sharing your story, although it's great to hear from all kinds of people, its nice to hear from someone who has had a very similar/relatable experience. I can understand why theres a focus on emphasising the point that not all people with mental/psychotic illness are violent to others, it also doesn't help though when it gets to a point that bringing it up can be taboo and then theres a lack of acknowledgement as to why the ones who act violent, act that way. Like you, I also have a tendency to act violent when mismanaged where it feels like direct provocation and I think most people with mental illness I've met that act violent, act violent for that reason too. Just remember, your worth isn't determined by your employment status. The hostility towards the unemployed is basically manufactured as without it existing then the whole control/profiteering system crumbles, so when you boil it down its nothing personal to you specifically really. I hope that you're now in a better place with the whole situation and are getting on well with the things that you're able to manage  #128578;</TEXT>

    <TEXT>It sounds like you could probably find these following links useful so that you can differentiate between occupational therapy and crisis teams as they offer a very different type of service: [This is information on the role of the crisis team](https://www.rethink.org/advice-and-information/living-with-mental-illness/treatment-and-support/crisis-teams/) and [this is the role of occupational therapy](https://www.humber.nhs.uk/news/What-do-Adult-Mental-Health-Service-occupational-therapists-do-OT-Week-6-10-Nov-2017.htm). If you wish to see a psychiatrist then you can ask your GP to refer you to one or ask your mental health team if you're a patient with them, or pay to see one privately if you can afford to. Occupational therapy will help with things like getting you more active and pursuing hobbies etc and the psychiatrist may be able to offer medication, advice and/or diagnosis. There has been a shift in attitudes now about diagnosing people though and there's now more of a focus on treating symptoms rather than putting a label on people but if you are deemed to be not functioning very well/hindered a lot by your issues then they may be willing to diagnose you.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>While I can understand in certain circumstances and with certain people it can be a liability, there are also many ways in which it can be an advantage. For example, I would personally prefer a support worker (or mental health medical professionals in general) who actually had a similar experience with mental health issues to myself, so in a role like that mental health issues are an advantage. People with higher functioning autism can also be highly intelligent above their peers in specific areas. I think it's worth pointing out that better staff management is actually the way to focus on this issue, rather than focusing on mental health issues being a liability when actually they can be an advantage - if managed in a way that can highlight their advantage rather than amplifying the sensitivities through poor staff management</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Yeah it would be nice if people looked at it more as a way of something that can be advantageous if managed better, even if it was also recognised as a potential liability. I think my issue is more with the fact there's a heavy focus on it being a liability and nothing else, rather than the acknowledgement that it can at times be a liability. Women who may need maternity leave potentially several times can be a liability, younger employees who may enjoy the party life can be a liability, older employees who may be less energetic can be a liability...I think we could potentially find a way to deem any group of people a liability but it seems with mental health it's just stuck in the 'beyond repair' category which is sad when theres better ways to deal with this issue but perhaps the way its treated differently is due to them not seeing that there are advantages and that its not just a liability</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I can see your side of things to all of the points that you're making but at the same time it's such a broad issue that its easy to conflate or disregard certain aspects of it. There are certain factual advantages to specific mental health issues but of course that doesn't apply to all so its definitely not about just focusing on the advantages but just acknowledging that there can be. Then there's the severity aspect so some people will only be midly impacted in the grand scheme of things, then there is personal perspective/motivation etc which is probably most important for any type of mental or physical health issue. There's people with far more mild and also more severe issues than me, both of which have thrived a whole lot more than me based upon personal perspective alone. If someone doesn't see their condition as a disability but rather as a motivation or challenge to achieve/thrive and is successful in that, is it not a positive thing? Perhaps they might not have had the same desire prior to a major physical injury or prior to certain experiences with their mental health issues. I do agree though that its also important to recognise there's many people who aren't able to view their condition in that way and that they shouldn't be pressured into doing so. It's just about striking a balance where people are allowed to be able to either thrive with their issues or to just simply manage their issues but because this is such a broad topic, I dont think blanket statements are helpful to either side in this case and certainly wont help in encouraging protection laws such as those around maternity leave.</TEXT>

How is it possible to get through to people who never need to care about the same issues as us? (Adequate healthcare, not mental health issues)</TEXT>

    <TEXT>No worries! If I'm honest it'd depend on my mental state but now that I'm older and more aware of how I react to certain things, I'd probably play it safe and avoid it altogether knowing it's too big of a risk to take. The key is probably to be able to incentivise in various ways so that it can target those who are less likely to come forward for therapy - I don't think that a 100% money back guarantee dependant on finishing all of the sessions will be reaching out to those who you might be wishing to reach out to, though of course every little bit helps and for some that'll be a good enough incentive. Perhaps something like offering a block booking style deal such as with driving lessons where someone could commit to extra sessions but at a reduced price for taking extra sessions, then money back on the remaining sessions if they have reached their goals before the amount of sessions they've booked, if that makes sense?</TEXT>

I think it'd be interesting to see whether there's been mainly positive or negative reactions or a bit of both and whether the reactions change more commonly in a certain way in specific settings etc. Good luck with your blog!</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Thanks for your post and for being willing to speak openly about your mental health, it's not always easy to do in the best of circumstances let alone being 'out there' with it on the internet! It would be interesting to know whether you feel being a guy has made things difficult for you in this area of life, or perhaps whether you've been more encouraged and received positivity for your courage to speak out/open up with how the times and attitudes are changing a bit. Perhaps being able to direct some tips or anything related to reaching out to other men would attract some attention and be quite helpful at this stage. Not that every video has to be that specific but I think one video on it would be great, if that's an idea you're interested in exploring  #128578;</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Sorry to hear about your situation, It certainly is super tough to deal with for everyone who is forced to deal with what they put you through. Have you been to your GP to explain the feelings you're currently having, or do you have any support with your community mental health team? It's important to try your best to keep calm because there are people who can help you with the legal side of things in terms of appeals etc. Many people who appeal get the decision turned around by the court and its not always necessary to attend if you have really bad anxiety as the court usually understands and allows for this</TEXT>

    <TEXT>From my experience it's not too daunting in itself (aside from the natural anxiety you may have) as you're sitting in a waiting room and then go through and it's like sitting with a GP. The thing is that unless its changed, its still very centred around physical health issues and so you need to make sure to be aware of when it could be relevant to bring up the issues you have with mental health issues especially if it impacts your physical abilities to do things. The chances are that you'll be turned down but you then have a decent time frame and will be able to receive help to appeal it, the DWP may also then turn you down in which case it can go to a court which is where most get overturned. It is really a game of patience!</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Yeah same here, it can be tough. Especially when sometimes it can be expected of you to feel happy about everything simply for having gotten away from a crappy situation. Theres still a whole lot to get over psychologically. Sometimes what can be helpful is to incorporate parts of it into your outside life e.g buying the same brand of drink that you had in there, eating at the same times as you did in there. So that it softens the blow a little while you slowly start to be able to focus on other things  #128578;</TEXT>

It's understandable to feel bad/hopeless etc given the circumstances but at the same time if they're allowed to break us down into silence then nobody will begin to truly understand the state that mental health treatment in the UK is in.

    <TEXT>Yeah I can definitely see your point about it feeling safer, though as you suggest there's probably other reasons behind the staff feeling that way such as convenience and feeling that the patients will engage more if they 'need' to come out, whereas in reality, at least on the male wards where ive been, patients will just pee in their room anyway whether theres a toilet or not. I find ensuites better so that theres less arguments about bathrooms being used and having to live by other peoples hygiene standards, which can be stressful and not good for peoples mental health itself It's good knowing there's been some new ones coming along though!</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Hi, thanks for sharing your story/experience! Hopefully there's someone here who will be able to help you a bit better than I could, as I have no experience with university or needing to have such in depth ruling out of physical causes etc. Perhaps their first episode diagnosis is just based on what they've seen from you personally? I'm guessing that maybe they might not be able to elaborate further if they haven't personally seen it and especially if they think what you're saying might not be totally reliable due to memory loss? Thats not to say what you're saying isnt reliable but just trying to see things from their position. In regards to realising your hallucinations are not real - I think that psychosis is different for everyone especially as theres many symptoms of it, and whilst some people have pretty much zero reality about them, some people do to slightly different degrees. I experience delusions and although sometimes I totally believe them no matter what, sometimes I can identify that my behaviour is getting more out of control and I'm aware people can see that im being odd but that doesnt stop the racing heart, sweating, paranoia, hypervigilance, the specific idea im delusional about etc so still psychotic if that makes sense. Changing care coordinators can sometimes be difficult but its worth asking whoever is the main provider of the care, whether thats the uni itself or whether its the actual team itself..I'm sure its nothing theyve never heard before but it might be difficult if they think that the thing driving you to making that request is psychosis. There are apparently a fair number of issues which can cause memory loss such as: Certian medications, Minor head trauma or injury, Emotional disorders, Alcoholism, Vitamin B-12 deficiency, Hyperthyroidism, Brain diseases such as tumours</TEXT>

I have very recently gone through a similar scenario and have gone through a whole range of emotions/stages over a very short space of time, so I can't speak from a wealth of experience but just to say that I can relate with how painful it must be for you right now. Have you tried speaking with anyone that was close with her about the grief? It'd be understandable if you or others close to her didn't want to speak directly about the situation yet but sometimes just the comfort of the mutual connection that you and someone else had with that person is enough to make things bearable for some people</TEXT>

Although you say she is not an abusive person, going through serious mental health issues can cause some people to become aggressive and even violent even if theyre usually not.

    <TEXT>I dont have personal experience with the adult mental health team yet, only CAMHS and youth team. Even so with anything in the NHS there is a big postcode lottery issue so it could vary quite a bit from area to area as actual policies may be different too. They'll probably be deciphering who is best placed to deal with your case and whoever that will be will contact you and deal with it accordingly, if it was crisis team then they'd likely contact to see you for a pretty quick assessment or if the mental health team then arrange for you to come in but not with the same urgency...I havnt a clue how thats working out now with face to face appointments being cancelled everywhere though, maybe they'll do a more detailed assessment over the phone to assess risk urgency</TEXT>

If there's ever any time where it's understandable to reach out despite high demand then it's certainly a time like this, its easy to feel a bit guilty in these circumstances but if we require a service thats designed to help any of us in a time of need then it's worth enquiring, perhaps you could email them so that it feels less imposing/time consuming?

    <TEXT>Hey! I'm someone who goes online to view/book GP appointments and ever since the start of this situation, all of the appointments have been taken and there's nothing available for the next 3 months at least unless they're able to somehow suddenly increase the amount they're offering. So you're definitely not alone as far as that issue is concerned but your additional needs do make things a little more difficult to advise on..the only thing I can suggest is to get your partner to call up the doctors surgery and see whether they can classify your situation as some degree of emergency which could allow for an "on-call" doctor there to have an appointment with you, or to be referred to the mental health team more quickly if you're not already associated with one, probably worth a try even if you're not able to get any luck!</TEXT>

    <TEXT>No worries! Just make sure that if you feel that it's risky to wait much longer then to make sure they're aware of that, if you/your partner try to play it down then they'll probably naturally think that it can wait much longer as they only know what's being told to them. It's great that you're able to see how much they've got to deal with already and I'm sure they'll appreciate that, but they're also still there for other medical conditions/situations which cannot wait too. It's not something you can control so try not to feel bad/guilty/difficult, you're just doing what would likely be advised by them in such a situation  #128578;</TEXT>

    <TEXT>That sounds highly stressful even without having to deal with timeframes and tribunals etc. If your GP is going to send you a letter and is aware of the whole situation then I imagine he has also "copied in" the relevant people at the tribunal by sending them the letter too? If you're in any doubt then I would suggest to get in contact with the local tribunal that is going to be dealing with the case so that they're aware that you're awaiting evidence, it's probably worth a try especially if you can prove that you've been attempting to get this information for a while</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Ah that sucks, I'd just suggest to contact the local tribunal and make them aware of the situation and that you're able to show that you've tried to get the information in time. It may not make any difference but there's nothing to lose and theres always the possibility that they may still even rule in your favour without the letter too. Tribunals are statistically way more likely to rule in your favour than the DWP decision makers</TEXT>

    <TEXT>That's great news, you're at least half way through the problem already now, compared to being stuck in an almost complete state of unknown and chaos last night! It's probably much easier for me to say as I do not experience autism but try to recognise/keep yourself "grounded" in this the new state that you're in which is more hopeful and gives you more options than the last state you were in. I appreciate that "grounding" techniques might not help in the severity of some of your issues but if you haven't given it a go before then it's something I'd suggest to try so that it may reduce panic etc. I understand though, benzos are the only thing that calm me down without a bunch of horrendous side effects. They dont want to have people addicted to them but then again if something works then of course people will be addicted, but if that addiction causes them to live a life that is less stressful/does more good than harm and the person isn't using irresponsibly, then I really don't see the problem</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Yeah definitely make sure to contact your next local GP surgery or get the mental health team to help you contact them in order to sign up elsewhere so that you're not stuck without anything, as I imagine that the ban will be for the whole GP surgery rather than just for seeing that specific GP. It's understandable to be frustrated and find it difficult to control emotions at the best of times when dealing with mental health issues but it's also important to remember that the big decisions that are negatively impacting you are likely not specifically caused by the GP. GPs can sometimes be a bit slow or not fully knowledgeable about these things but it's not typically because they have all the powers and are just deciding to be obstructive, it's because they are only *general* and not specialist. Being too outwardly aggressive towards them won't impact the people that you need to get your point across to, and will likely just make your life more difficult such as with the being banned situation. It's great to see you've got something to aim towards though, you seem very passionate and so I imagine that you will do quite well in something that you decide you want to pursue!</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Hey, hope you and your partner are currently managing okay with things! I think that in your current situation, if your partner can demonstrate/prove in some way that the medication doesn't impact her drivng through perhaps a specialist medical report then she should stand a good chance of being allowed to drive. This is from the Gov website:  gt;  #10008;- Must not drive during acute illness and must notify the DVLA.  gt; Licensing may be considered if all of these conditions are met:  gt;  #9632; remained well and stable for at least 3 months  gt;  #9632; adheres to any agreed treatment plan  gt;  #9632; free from any medication effects that would impair driving  #9632; subject to a suitable specialist report being favourable.  gt; lack of insight which impacts upon the ability to drive safely would be a bar to licensing.  gt; Drivers with a history of instability and/or poor engagement with treatment will be required not to drive for a longer period before any relicensing.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Hey! Good to know that you've been able to get the access to support that you're needing. Mind if I ask what kinds of symptoms you're trying to treat? If that's too much of a personal question then feel free to not answer. I have experience with Quetiapine, it's quite heavily sedating especially for those who are new to it (even in the smallest doses) or haven't taken them consistently. I have found my dreams become very realistic at least in the early phase when adjusting to it. It's typically one of the least riskiest anti psychotics when it comes to weight gain too and I have not noticed any outright bad effects from taking Quetiapine myself but I know just like with any medication that it can be quite a variable experience</TEXT>

    <TEXT> gt; Both the doctors and I agree that it is necessary to admit George to hospital for a period of assessment under the MHA. George does not agree. There is a bed locally, however, the ambulance has been delayed. When I tell George the outcome of the assessment, he tells me he is not going to hospital. I try and explained to him what our concerns are but he does not accept or believe these. He gets really angry and starts to swear at me. He tells me I am not real and cannot control him. Initially he didn't agree with it, though someone saying that they do agree might be saying so because they're aware there will be less constraints if attending voluntarily and so could then be back in a dangerous situation quite easily, so in my opinion it's more of a case-by-case issue</TEXT>

    <TEXT>It's very easy to feel that we're so far gone but it's usually just our individual perception based on our current terrible circumstances - what advice would you give to someone who messaged you the same situation that you've messaged me? Would you tell them that they're so far gone? I'm guessing not..I appreciate it's easier said than done but try to afford yourself the same compassion and hope that you would hope to offer anyone else in the same situation, it's little things like that which can really hinder our ability to progress/move forward. You could try writing down a feeling, issue or concern that you have and then writing down how you would respond as if someone had messaged you stating it. Mood diaries can be helpful too because you can more easily pinpoint anything that is triggering certain emotions and actions, [you can read more about mood diaries here](https://mymoodpath.com/en/magazin/mood-diary/)</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I know how crappy severe depression can be, every option/route can feel like a dead-end. It's fairly common for us to base our emotions on our current circumstances, when things around us are going good we tend to feel great and vice versa when things are bad...the good news is that it allows for change but the bad news is that our perspective won't really change unless our circumstances/surroundings are changed. So usually it is a forced change e.g divorce, marriage, homelessness etc. We do have more control over ourselves than we often feel we do though, there's usually nothing literally stopping us except for our minds so practicing mindfulness can be quite good at addressing that type of issue if you want to give it a go  #128578;</TEXT>

    <TEXT>If it's been a while since you last saw/spoke to a GP then I guess theres nothing to lose in seeing a different GP if possble and explaining that what they offered was not helpful for you. Sometimes you can get lucky and there'll have been a new setup service to try out. If you need to speak to anyone to relieve some pressure then do try out the Samaritans. It does suck though that the attitude seems to be that if you're not suicidal then you don't need help...because I'm pretty sure a while of recieving no help can cause that to happen! I'm sure funding also has a lot to do with it but if they mean what they say then hopefully there'll be some much needed changes #129310; #127995;</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Yeah unfortunately it must be like being stuck between a rock and a hard place. The GPs can only really offer basic mental health help due to time constraints and lack of specialist knowledge, usually just help in the form of signposting or chucking antidepressants at people to see if it can possibly help. It's easy to get frustrated with them but ultimately there's little else they can do, there's been cases of them getting a bollocking for trying to expedite referrals for people who are in need of specialist help but not actively/immediately suicidal Even if the funding was upped, there's still a high criteria for being able to see an adult local mental health team. If you're comfortable sharing your area I could perhaps see what the exact criteria is for your area. It sounds plausible that they could be trying to slow things down a bit to work on issues though. Have you tried contacting any local charities such as Mind or anything similar in your area?</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I know the feeling! The best you can do is probably take the time to explore videos/blogs on Mindfulness and perhaps apps such as 'Headspace' and 'Calm' - they're not everyone's cup of tea but they're highly rated therapeutic options to try out until things start to normalise again. Anything distracting and time-killing will probably be helpful, perhaps it might help to write a plan of what you're going to do the next day and at what times so that you'll always feel there's something purposeful you can be getting on with? If you're more spontaneous then perhaps a better idea would be to try something new, whether it's drastic or mundane If things do get worse then dont hesitate to use the helplines as they're there for anyone who needs it. You don't need to be suicidal to call up or email the Samaritans (116 123 or Jo@samaritans.org), if you're feeling actively suicidal then call NHS 111 or go to A amp;E depending on the particular state of urgency/emergency that it is</TEXT>

I've got adrenaline rushing through me and almost feel sick with horror at the predicament I'm in, but simultaneously giddy with joy. I guess this could potentially be Emotional Dysregulation which is also a symptom of BPD. Emotional Dysregulation can potentially be quite severe such as making threats to kill yourself or others (in circumstances where it's not deemed an appropriate emotional response) and also having rapidly changing moods which can potentially be within minutes, hours or days</TEXT>

There are also websites with helpful information such as [this one](https://www.disabilityrightsuk.org/benefits-checklist) but I'm not sure whether that would still be difficult for you to do by yourself. If you have any specific questions about the process such as understanding what the DWP want you to do and what things you should mention, then you can always message me too</TEXT>

    <TEXT>That would be rather nice I agree! I think that much of it depends on the area because the GP can only signpost to what is actually there. Some areas allow them to prescribe nature, animal or sport related therapy activies now. It's surprising how good one of those activities can make someone feel regardless of whether they have depression, bipolar, personality disorder etc. I would suggest to perhaps inquire about something like that and if not seeing what may be about in your area that they may have missed out</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Hello all! As someone from the UK who has dealt with mental health issues for years, I've noticed a lack of active UK spaces and would like to try and change that if there is the demand for it. [You can find my subreddit here](https://www.reddit.com/r/MentalHealthUK/) Anyone is welcome to participate but I would prefer it if people who are not from the UK only talk about their specific healthcare processes/systems if relevant to a comments discussion rather than promoting it - just so we dont get swamped out/conflicting information due to uneven population. I'm keeping the sub active mainly through posting mental health news articles but eventually hoping it can be a more varied sub where people can either ask questions, talk with like minded people, give support, vent or promote their own blogs or work if related to mental health/therapy. Thanks for reading if you got this far  #128578;</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Hey there! Sorry to hear about the situation with your youngest cat, along with all of the other stresses going on for you, past and present. Have you tried seeing a different GP? You should be able to do that if you're comfortable doing so. It can be easy to see GPs almost as though they are all the same due to their position/role and although they do have certain guidance to follow, they're still human and prone to using their own experiences to their advantage (in helping others) as well as their own discretion which will be variable from GP to GP. Unless there are several different branches as well as the one in Buckinghamshire, it seems like they can be contacted directly via phone or email which may be worth a try in case there has been some kind of mistake or backlog issue etc. Their email address is: healthy.minds@oxfordhealth.nhs.uk Their contact number is: 01865 901600</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I have heard from some people that it's been a really good thing for them because there's been less triggers for their anxiety. Some people have enjoyed actually having the time to be with their own household which had made them feel more connected. On the other hand there's been issues that perhaps some people wouldn't think about immediately such as many people with autism who have found the change in routine/not having the same foods etc very difficult. Personally I'm not a social person, very similar to what you describe. The problem is that I feel grounded when I have a routine which has been impacted with the food issues, social changes/rules for when I do have to go out, lack of sport to watch etc. I'm not sure whether you experience depression but perhaps if you did then that might lead to not feeling much about it? Though im sure it's perfectly possible that it just doesn't bother a particular person too</TEXT>

I like the fact that they state that they dont expect you to always be suicidal plus there is an option to email rather than to just call up.

Theres innocent people killing themselves over false allegations which are very easy to make to any particular person and also people who have done serious things who are allowed to continue in roles which would be damaging the clients/customers etc</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I can't help but feel that, that is probably the low-key point/aim in many cases. The US system focusses heavily on punishment even to the point of death and that's clearly done little if anything to reduce crime rates.

    <TEXT>I feel that the majority of people recognise that crime will not disappear but that it's about how we deal with crime that is crucial. There have been successes in crime rate in countries where rehabilitation is prioritised over punishment which often mixes lower level offenders with higher level offenders which creates a bigger problem. I don't feel that anyone argues that severe crimes should not result in punishment but more so that lower level offenders should be able to have the opportunity to learn and progress from what happened through something such as restorative justice, rather than being put in a situation which will likely end up a cycle of crime as is often the case. Taken from [this article](https://theconversation.com/why-rehabilitation-not-harsher-prison-sentences-makes-economic-sense-132213)  gt; One of the largest such schemes  #8211; Operation Checkpoint  #8211; is being run by Durham Constabulary. This  #8220;deferred prosecution scheme #8221; allows offenders for certain types of relatively low harm offences (such as theft or criminal damage) to avoid prosecution if they participate in a programme that addresses their causes of offending  #8211; such as mental health issues or substance abuse. The first set of #160;results #160;from this programme, recently published, show a 15% reduction in reoffending rates when compared to similar offenders who did not participate.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I feel that this should be posted due to how high profile this case is and also with there being additional issues in mental health care for people on the Autistic Spectrum currently being highlighted. A post title isn't enough to portray this story fairly for anyone, including people on the Autistic Spectrum who may be associated with or feel they'll be associated with this level of crime based on the title alone. So here is the full article text:  gt; An autistic teenager who #160;threw a six-year-old boy from a balcony at the #160;Tate Modern #160;is to be sentenced today for attempted murder.  gt; Jonty Bravery, 18, told police he wanted to be  #8220;on the news #8221; after he committed the offence in front of horrified onlookers at the London tourist attraction on August 4 last year.  gt; CCTV footage appeared to show Bravery, then 17, peering over the edge of the art gallery #8217;s viewing platform, 10 storeys up, before seizing the young victim and hurling him over the edge.  gt; Bravery, from Ealing in west London, then sought out Tate staff and confessed:  #8220;I think I #8217;ve murdered someone, I #8217;ve just thrown someone off the balcony. #8221;  gt; He told police he heard voices in his head telling him to kill or injure someone.  gt; Bravery #8217;s victim, who cannot be named due to reporting restrictions, suffered a bleed to the brain, spinal fractures, and broken legs and arms.  gt; The latest update on a GoFundMe page, which has raised more than  #163;200,000 for the boy #8217;s medical treatment in his native France, said he remained in a wheelchair and had problems eating, speaking and moving, but was continuing to make progress.  gt; The update, posted on behalf of his family on May 15, said:  #8220;There is still a long way to go but we are holding on. #8221;  gt; The court previously heard how Bravery was seen wandering around the viewing platform before picking up his victim and throwing him over the edge  #8211; with the boy falling five storeys, around 30m (100ft).  gt; He then approached a member of staff, explaining what he had done.  gt; Bravery later told police he had to prove a point  #8220;to every idiot #8221; who said he had no mental health problems, asking police if the incident was going to be on the news.  gt; He said:  #8220;I wanted to be on the news, who I am and why I did it, so when it is official no-one can say anything else. #8221;  gt; In a series of social media posts, which have since been deleted, Piers Bravery  #8211; the father of the defendant  #8211; attempted to raise awareness of autism and its treatment.  gt; In one tweet to Health Secretary Matt Hancock, posted less than three months before the incident, Mr Bravery said:  #8220;Yes, @MattHancock, you do have a duty. You are a public servant so do your job and stop more children dying and being abused in these repugnant institutions. #8221;  gt; Bravery, who has autistic spectrum disorder, obsessive compulsive disorder and who is believed to have a personality disorder, has been held at Broadmoor Hospital since mid-October.  gt; The sentencing hearing, before Mrs Justice McGowan at the #160;Old Bailey, is listed to last all day on Thursday.</TEXT>

I would say psychosis caused by substance misuse could easily be a possibility, perhaps also with PTSD. Statistics do suggest that people with mental health issues are more often a victim of violence rather than perpetrators of violence, however, there are certain mental health symptoms within certain conditions which can cause violence. I feel it's important to acknowledge that certain conditions have certain symptoms which can potentially cause violence so that the person can be helped with their symptoms which will benefit themselves as well as others. I feel that it's about taking swift and appropriate action in order to protect others as well as the person experiencing these symptoms, as often they are not just a terrible person/psychopathic and would be able to be helped when given the right support</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I feel that it's probably most beneficial to be able to come to a point where we can accept that it's not a 'black or white' type of issue and that treating it as such will likely only cause more harm. We often see that type of view collectively among professionals e.g favouring diagnosis vs favouring simply treating symptoms, favouring hospitalisation vs favouring care in the community etc. It's frustrating for me to see how there's so little of a happy-medium being struck at times. It's such a nuanced issue...potentially we could argue that almost all people with a mental health issue (exc. diagnoses associated with psychopathy) are non-violent but then you have to factor in environmental issues that could trigger a certain aspect of someone's mental health condition which could make them act in a violent way despite them generally being non-violent. It's certainly a shame that the actions of one person can potentially tarnish a whole group of people but it is up to us all as individuals to educate ourselves and accept that logically one person cannot represent a group of millions of people. Unfortunately there's always those that refuse to educate themselves and there's only so much that can be done to healthily challenge those who that applies to but the best way is likely what is currently being done - reiterating that there are many factors involved and that one person does not represent a whole group</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Being wealthy seems to help more than it should do in certain types of cases, however, views on mental health issues and how to deal with them seem so inconsistent regardless. It's sometimes like you just cant win...your issues/illness is severe? Well rather than treatment then you must be in prison despite it being a severe *illness*. Your issues/illness are milder? Well you're clearly of sound mind then so you'll be punished anyway despite having a milder *illness*. That's not to say everyone has to feel that what they experience is utterly detrimental because for some people it isn't but for some people it can be and I don't believe punishing someone for an illness is the way to go when they are already feeling punished by what they're experiencing</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Hey, thanks for being open and willing to share your experience and sorry to hear about the negative aspects you mentioned - there's a few things there I can relate with so I can understand to a degree how difficult some things have been for you to deal with. First of all, I think that many mental health professionals are very wary of diagnosing people - even to the point of the lack of diagnosis/addressing issues being very dangerous. I think this is partly due to them fearing that people will manipulate the system by obtaining a diagnosis in order to get higher rates of benefits and be long-term unemployed. I also think this is due to pressure to destigmatise to the extreme and actually go for the 'If they dont know it exists then it wont exist' type of approach, as opposed to years ago when everything under the sun was diagnosed and caused unnecessary hospitalisation etc. This is just my personal views from my experience though, others may have very different experiences than mine. There shouldn't be any need for you to be assessed for ADHD first but if they believe that's causing the most issues or is your predominant issue then I guess that would be a cause to prioritise that. As you mention though, there's still many assumptions floating about which can cloud judgement when it comes to diagnosing people such as with women and ADHD or Autism Spectrum Disorders. Sorry if I missed it in your post but where are things at the moment? Are you currently receiving any support from a GP or mental health team? I would definitely recommend seeking the help of a local advocacy service because they will be best placed to navigate the way things are in your particular area. If you wanted to then you could also complain to PALs which is explained fully [here](https://www.nhs.uk/common-health-questions/nhs-services-and-treatments/what-is-pals-patient-advice-and-liaison-service/)</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Yeah, another consideration is that if they're not the ones to diagnose something then they're less likely to be liable if something goes seriously wrong, so it's kind of like 'passing the buck'. Perhaps they may be told by their higher-ups that they should avoid diagnosing though - it's a little difficult to say whether there's some kind of unwritten rule against diagnosing or whether it's very much left down to the individual medical professional. It's great that you - like me - are willing and wanting to to educate yourself around what may be impacting you but I'd definitely say that's a no-no in terms of mentioning your research/what you've concluded of your research with a medical professional. It can potentially come across that you may think that you know better than them or that you're too keen to feel victimised by a label - I dont believe either is the case for you or for the majority of people seeking help but I do feel this is how it can be viewed by certain medical professionals. Again, that's not an outright fact but just what I've seen and believed from my own experiences over the years. You're certainly not alone in your frustration with this issue and it's great to see others have added to that on here too The best thing that you can do is what you are currently doing. Chasing them up and getting in touch with an adovacy service to apply pressure where its needed from people that the professionals will listen to. I hope that you get a breakthrough some point in the near future, I'm sure all of this perseverance will pay-off and you'll get some much needed and deserved help  #128578;</TEXT>

Perhaps this is something that is/was going to become generally more prevalent again in all areas but it certainly shouldn't be.

    <TEXT>Perhaps in the past his symptoms were less clear than they are now and he might have better luck with a more current assessment so that's good to hear. I know far less than qualified professionals but it seems to me that at least his current behaviour is indicative of psychosis and is just a disaster waiting to happen because his reality seems very altered which he likely wont recognise if he is in fact psychotic Have you tried reaching out to any local advocacy services? They might be able to signpost him to people who know how the system works with all it's little intricacies Again, you're doing a great job. It might seem like you're always going nowhere with this and sometimes in some cases that does happen but your actions do make a difference - it sets a great example for others to follow and let's people know that they are at least not alone.

    <TEXT>You're welcome! For some people there is no support quite like family support, however, it seems like you are dealing with a few too many issues right now which is likely going to cause more problems. It's understandable and natural that you'd want to help in any way possible but if it's becoming unmanageable then there's no shame in admitting that too, there's people out there who will be more than willing to help if they're aware of the situation. One organisation that I can think of immediately is Cruse Bereavement which is a free and confidential service, you can find their contact details [here](https://www.cruse.org.uk/) You can search which bereavement support services may be local specifically to your area [here](https://www.nhs.uk/service-search/other-services/Bereavement%20support/LocationSearch/314) Although it's not your fault for wanting to do what you feel is best for you, I feel that perhaps your mother may feel triggered by the thought of "losing" you due to her recent bereavement, so almost feeling like a double bereavement. For many of us, when things are going great we can easily forget what it really feels like to have been in terrible situations and when things are going terribly, we can just as easily forget what it's like for life to have been anything other than terrible. The pendulum can easily swing either way but sometimes we are tricked by our mind when we live too much/literally "in the moment". It sounds like you could benefit from talking to someone due to the amount of pressure and issues you are facing, have you ever spoken to anyone such as the Samaritans before?</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I know it's easier said than done but try not to focus on feeling like overburdening them. They are doing that job because they want to help people, they are there for anyone who needs their support. This is taken from the Samaritans website:  gt; We offer a safe place for you to talk any time you like, in your own way  #8211; about whatever #8217;s getting to you.  gt; We won't judge you or tell you what to do, we'll listen to you. Some people believe that their problems aren't "real" enough but if it's causing distress then that's enough of a cause for concern. People's tolerance levels for issues and how they manage stress etc is very different and individual so there's no solid definition of a "real" enough problem. A problem is a problem which can easily cause more problems so try not to feel guilty about reaching out at the right time for you, to those who are designed to support people The Samaritans will listen to you but may not be able to offer any long term solutions, though I'm sure they can signpost you to organisations that will be able to help with reaching more long term solutions, such as perhaps bereavement services or advocacy services if necessary. It sounds like you could still benefit from having a chat/being listened to so there's nothing to lose in giving it a go this time around  #128578;</TEXT>

    <TEXT>That's a bit of a tricky question to answer as you could argue that therapy sessions may help you to feel more stable, or that you not feeling stable could mean that therapy would make less of a difference. Does this psychologist know anything about your history/did you brief them when arranging these sessions? Do you know which issues this person specialises in? It may be the case that, unless they specialise in particular areas, if you have a history of becoming quite unstable and can easily act in extreme/risky ways then they may feel uncomfortable continuing with sessions - I think this is due to them realising that it could become too costly and there being a lack of continuity if you may easily need intervention from NHS services such as crisis resolution teams etc.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Hey there. What you're saying does make sense and I have an idea of what may be the issue but it's certainly advisable to speak to a professional if these symptoms are causing long-term distress Do you have any idea whether there's a way in which you'd feel it was manageable to speak to someone about your issues? For example, is it more that you have an issue with social anxiety and find it difficult to go out and speak to someone about this but would find it easier to text/email? Is there anything that could make an appointment feel more comforting such as taking notes with you or wearing earphones?</TEXT>

    <TEXT>If you find yourself struggling to cope and are in a crisis then there is a free UK 24/7 text service called [Shout](https://www.giveusashout.org/) I can relate with the part where you say you hide it from other people, I tend to do the same but then admittedly it does mean I end up going through things alone which isn't very healthy as it's risky. My senses are sensitive so I find it comforting to do those little things which may also work for others who are feeling overwhelmed - afterall it doesn't necessarily matter about how something is done but just that it is done if needed  #128578;</TEXT>

It sounds like it's definitely worth giving it a go as at worst you can decide it's not for you and at best it could change many aspects of your life for the better - cant know until you try  #128578;</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Yes I'm particularly sensitive to light and sound. So doing certain things which addresses either of those can help me feel less overwhelmed and more able to concentrate on whatever it is I need to focus on. If you haven't already, you could also try using a stress ball but taking it with you so that it can be used while you're interacting or perhaps wearing a clothing accessory (bracelet, necklace etc) which you can play with to calm the nerves a bit It's good to hear you dont plan to give up on life though and hopefully you are able to find a way that works best for you in being able to address these issues</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I was actually considering 'undiagnosed' as a flair so it's cool to see someone else has the same thought, thanks for that addition. I'm a bit hesitant on the last suggestion though as I feel that may be falling a bit too far down the self diagnosis/diagnosis of others kind of route which for the sake of a flair, will probably do more potential damage than good. Thought it might be helpful for me to be openly communicative about both the things I am and aren't keen on so that it opens up discussion and can keep everyone in the loop  #128578;</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Good to hear that you managed to attend the appointment considering that you were feeling unsure about even doing just that. I think something that might be helpful is to focus on mindfulness (there are YouTube vids and books etc around this) because it is about really embracing how you feel rather than trying to deny it and then developing unhealthy strategies in order to deny it. That way, you may be able to find a way to feel a little more confident about knowing that although you may feel terrible now, you'll be able to ride it out and inevitably will feel differently later rather than getting too overwhelmed.

It becomes quite a difficult situation to navigate when we consider whether it should actually be made unlawful vs making the criteria for accessing that treatment a lot stricter/more specific</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Quetiapine is not typically the go-to medication when someone specifically needs a mood stabiliser, however, as it is quite sedating it can address certain issues related to mood such as being quite easily angry/agitated and so that can be quite helpful in levelling things out a bit. Mental health professionals here can be vary wary of diagnosing people even if they do have a good idea of what the issue is, they often prefer the approach of just focusing on treating the symptoms rather than focusing on what the underlying cause for the symptoms are. So I'm not sure whether you will get an answer as to specifically why you're taking this medication in regards to the diagnosis but if they did tell you, they'd want to make sure they were confident in their diagnosis first which may require months of assessment (some diagnoses require being assessed or having certain symptoms for a certain period of weeks or months). Either way, I hope that you find the treatment helpful  #128578;</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Unpleasant things can happen to anyone at anytime, more importantly though is how you feel about the situations you're dealt with and how you deal with them, right? That's one of the things therapy is good for - helping challenge how you currently deal with things and how to deal with them in better ways. Its important to go there with an open mind though as if you go there believing that only something specifically bad will happen - then you'll likely limit yourself to something specifically bad happening. There's nothing to lose, try go with as much of an open mind as possible and see what happens  #128578;</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Hey, sorry to hear about the difficulties you're having. Unfortunately I dont feel I can give accurate information regarding universal credit due to your living situation potentially impacting what you may be entitled to though perhaps others here have experience with that. I would suggest to search for and contact your local Citizens Advice Bureau, as well as potentially any local advocacy services. You can apply for PIP (the new version of DLA) though you'll most likely have to be assessed and it'll likely be a long process due to assessors typically giving people low scores to press them into giving up - people who appeal though more often than not get the decision overturned. You might find that it can help to just stabilise you until you're in a better state but you will need to meet certain criteria to be eligible for it though, which can be found here and is explained in some detail: https://www.turn2us.org.uk/Benefit-guides/Personal-Independence-Payment-Test/What-is-the-PIP-test#guide-content</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I thought I would quickly address this issue openly so that it's clear I'm not just ignoring the reports. The reason why I am not removing certain posts that are being reported as spam is because the individual is not spamming here specifically - if they have something relevant and beneficial to share then I dont feel that removing it is necessary simply because it's posted in various other subreddits. If they were posting the same thing here then all posts except the original would be removed and I would message the user. With that being said, if there are any issues on this subreddit that are urgent (harrassment, malicious material etc) then feel free to PM me directly for a quick response as I have not yet set up Automoderator.

When you said medication change I assumed you meant more 1-2 weeks ago - I'm sure it's still possible that you're not getting along with the new dosage, however, it's a bit strange that this has occurred after 8 weeks which could suggest it's also unrelated or potentially a developing issue.

I think that people who have had negative experiences will be a lot louder than those who have had positive experiences but the whole point of an ombudsman is to be independent and impartial - at the moment it seems you're complaining within the organisation itself which unfortunately probably wont get you very far as big organisations often do all they can to cover up mistakes unless held accountable by independent organisations. It's understandable that you feel it's necessary to try getting the point across within the organisation too though.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Fear is the most powerful weapon that isn't literally a weapon - it can control a whole country and beyond. I feel that the heavy focus on imprisonment is more of a means of playing on certain people's fears in order to gain votes rather than actually looking at what will reduce crime/rehabilitate. The system is broken - doesn't work in the US and doesn't work here either for the most part. I look forward to the day when we show we can learn from the statistics of countries with a more progressive and rehabilitation focused system. Bit of a rant there but that's just my view haha  #129296;</TEXT>

    <TEXT>**I have included the full text in two parts here (as it was so lengthy to fit in one comment) because this is probably the most disturbing and evil case of mistreatment in modern times I've seen in the UK which deserves wide recognition:** **PART 1**  gt; Desperate to know how her autistic son Ryan was coping after being detained for years in an NHS mental health hospital, Sharon Clarke dialled the telephone number for the ward again, struggling to understand why she couldn #8217;t get through  #8211; she had no idea then that both her and her husband #8217;s telephone numbers had been deliberately blocked by NHS staff.  gt; Whoever was responsible has never been identified but the intentional act in October 2019 was yet further proof for Sharon that her son was in the wrong place and needed help to get out.  gt; The Humber Centre, in Hull, is a secure forensic psychiatry unit, more commonly used for treating those who have committed crimes because of a serious mental illness. Ryan has been locked up by the NHS having never committed a crime.  gt; For the last four years he has been isolated in long term segregation and monitored at all times by at least three staff. Over the years, he has been so heavily medicated with powerful drugs he has had to have 14 teeth removed. He was fitted with dentures but they were lost 18 months ago and have yet to be replaced, his mother said.  gt; Hospital reports seen by The Independent show he has also suffered bruises after being restrained by nine staff, as well as a broken arm and a broken foot. There have also been suggestions by staff in reports that he shows signs of sexual abuse.  gt; It has been 14 years since Ryan, now aged 31, was first taken to hospital under the Mental Health Act and his doctors, nurses, NHS managers and even a tribunal judge, all agree he should not be languishing in detention. But despite the promises from the NHS to get him out, he is still there. And he is not alone.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>**PART 2**  gt; The latest data published this week showed there were hundreds of patients diagnosed with autism detained in mental health units in England, and despite promises to get them out, the numbers are rising, having more than doubled from 295 in March 2015, to 610 in June this year.  gt; In total, there were more than 2,000 patients with both learning disabilities and/or autism detained in hospitals. Locked away from their families, deprived of a normal life in institutions that far from treating them, actually exacerbate behavioural problems making it even harder for them to be released.  gt; Ryan #8217;s mother Sharon told The Independent she regretted the day she called the NHS for help after her son, then just 17, self-harmed with a razor, causing superficial injuries months after he had been prescribed the anti-psychotic drug olanzapine.  gt;  #8220;I knew it was a cry for help. I rang the NHS crisis team and asked for help. They came and took him into hospital.  gt;  #8220;He was crying to come home but I told him he had to stay because they were going to make him better. All these years later, look where we are.  gt;  #8220;They have not only stolen him away from me, they #8217;ve stolen his youth away from him. #8221;  gt; Initially, Ryan was detained in an open mental health hospital but as his behaviour deteriorated, brought on by detention, he was moved to more secure units. In total he has spent nine years in secure forensic mental health wards.  gt; He was finally diagnosed with autism only at the beginning of 2018 and his hospital reports, seen by The Independent, make clear he has suffered a form of post-traumatic stress disorder as a result of being detained away from his family for so long.  gt; On visits to see him Sharon was told for years she could not hug her son, although this has been relaxed since his autism diagnosis. She was not allowed to take pictures or see the room where he lived. Ryan is brought to her when she visits him.  gt;  #8220;I can #8217;t see where my son lives, where he eats. I #8217;m not allowed. You imagine all sorts of things, is it just a mattress on the floor? #8221;  gt; Between October 2017 and February 2018, Ryan and his mother were unable to see each other. He had been put into seclusion by staff after showing aggression and violence and was not allowed any contact at all with the outside world.  gt; His mother said Ryan had never been violent before being detained and she believes that, like many autistic people in hospital, his behaviour is being made worse as he becomes more institutionalised.  gt;  #8220;He did have problems. He hated surprises but apart from that he loved animals and was a proper family person. He was never violent or aggressive, never.  gt;  #8220;I can #8217;t believe the things they say he has done, it #8217;s just not my son. He has become institutionalised. I want him to come out and become the son I know.  gt;  #8220;If I was locked up like him I would probably react the same way. #8221;  gt; When her telephone number was blocked from being able to call the hospital ward last year it was a final straw for Sharon who is demanding the NHS releases her son from the hospital into a community-based placement.  gt;  #8220;It was a weekend when it happened. They were short-staffed, and I only phone up twice a day in the morning and night to check Ryan is ok.  gt;  #8220;I tried calling the ward and it was just engaged all the time. I tried hours later and couldn #8217;t get through. I tried on my husband #8217;s phone and got through then I tried mine and it was still engaged so then I knew. Later they blocked my husband #8217;s phone too.  gt;  #8220;You think of nurses as caring but that is not caring. The trust I had with the hospital to look after my son has gone out the window, I can #8217;t trust them now. #8221;  gt; Sharon made a formal complaint and in its response last December, NHS England #8217;s regional director of commissioning said the Humber Foundation Trust had investigated and  #8220;confirmed that you and your husband had had your phones blocked #8221; but added:  #8220;Due to the number of staff that had been on duty over that time they were unable to determine who had done this. Therefore, they are unable to bring about a disciplinary investigation. Senior managers were clear with the team that this was unacceptable and underlined that this action amounts to misconduct. #8221;  gt; The letter promised NHS England and the Hull Clinical Commissioning Group, which is responsible for commissioning NHS services in the area were looking to develop a community care package for Ryan. Sharon says she has heard these promises before and nothing has been done.  gt; Dr Sushie Dobbinson, a speech and language therapist at the hospital, expressed her fears for Ryan in a document dated July 2018. She said:  #8220;Ryan #8217;s environment continues to concern me as it does not allow for meaningful work to improve his presentation. The literature and our experience strongly indicate that seclusion in autistic spectrum disorder exacerbates symptoms and is detrimental to mental health. #8221;  gt; She warned patients with autism  #8220;often become more inward looking the longer they are secluded #8221;.  gt; She said the situation meant Ryan was at risk of harm, adding:  #8220;I continue to advocate for Ryan to be moved to a unit suitable for his ASD [autism spectrum disorder] needs and to warn of the consequences of long term seclusion for this very unwell young man. #8221;  gt; But the tribunal was clear who was at fault, saying:  #8220;Of equal concern is a lack of progress by the CCG [clinical commissioning group] and NHS England in formulating a discharge plan. Significant periods of time between meetings have been noted. #8221;  gt; An independent care treatment review in April also red-flagged multiple concerns about Ryan #8217;s care and his prolonged detention. It said the panel had  #8220;great concern #8221; for Ryan #8217;s  #8220;experience of care and safety #8221;.  gt; This situation has had an effect on Ryan. Staff have described him struggling with his self-esteem and sometimes telling himself off. They report he sometimes paces, punches walls or the air. His levels of violence and aggression have got worse.  gt; An independent tribunal earlier this year backed up her fears, saying there were concerns that the hospital was  #8220;inappropriate because the high level of security is likely contributing/leading to an increase in disturbed behaviour and is therefore counter-therapeutic #8221;.  gt; Sharon told The Independent:  #8220;If they don #8217;t get him out this year, or in the next couple of months I don #8217;t think there will be much left to get out.  gt;  #8220;Something needs to be done as soon as possible. They are ruining people #8217;s lives. #8221;  gt; Ms Clarke says he has asked for meetings with hospital bosses and contact details for Hull CCG but these have not been provided.  gt; This situation is being repeated across the country for hundreds of other patients with specialist autistic needs.  gt; Jane Harris, from the National Autistic Society, told The Independent Ryan #8217;s treatment by the NHS was  #8220;inhuman #8221; adding:  #8220;We know from Ryan's autism diagnosis, he's been put somewhere that is often doing the opposite of what he needs. He is being traumatised by an attempt to treat him. #8221;  gt; She said the case, and many others like his raised questions about whether his human rights were being breached saying:  #8220;It #8217;s clearly a human rights issue. How can it not be? He hasn't got a family life at the moment. #8221;  gt; She said it was too easy under the Mental Health Act to detain people with autism, adding:  #8220;These powers that are meant to be used for emergencies are ending up being used for years and years and totally changing the course of someone's life.  gt;  #8220;We're in this ridiculous situation where hundreds of autistic people are in these kind of units, but actually the Mental Health Act code of practice says they shouldn't be.  gt;  #8220;It's known that if you don't give autistic people the kind of environments and the kind of support that they need. Then their mental health will deteriorate, that's just a fact. It's totally morally wrong and indefensible. #8221;  gt; She said there were many examples of people being released from hospitals and going on to live safely in the community.  gt;  #8220;This is the really ridiculous thing about the situation. It's not useful for anybody. It's awful for Ryan and it's awful for his family. But it doesn't help the taxpayer either. #8221;  gt; Earlier this week the government announces a new  #163;62m fund, over three years, to help local councils pay for bespoke care packages in the community which should help ensure patients are discharged from hospital. But councils have faced increased costs during the coronavirus with social care estimated to need up to  #163;10 billion by the Health Foundation.  gt; A report by Parliament #8217;s Joint Committee on Human Rights last year highlighted there were widespread breaches of human rights for patients detained in hospitals.  gt; Health secretary Matt Hancock asked Baroness Hollins to oversee independent case reviews for each detained patient.  gt; In a joint statement from Hull CCG and Humber Teaching Foundation Trust the organisations said they were working together  #8220;to support Ryan #8217;s future care needs. We communicate regularly with his family with the aim of ensuring we are able to provide Ryan with a future place in the community, and level of care, which is suitable for him. Above all, we want him to live a full and active life out of hospital.  gt;  #8220;The recommendations of all independent care and treatment reviews are implemented as appropriate and changes required are made in a timely way to address any issues raised. #8221;  gt; A spokesperson for NHS England said:  #8220;There is complete agreement that alternative options need to be available."</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I agree. It seems a bit odd though considering how it would actually probably be cheaper in the long term to fund this issue properly in the first place. I imagine it's an eye watering amount of money that has been spent on keeping this poor guy locked up like this for 14 years - and that's just one single person! It's so sad that the only cases similar to this that I've read is involving people who have gone out to actually try and murder someone - yet this is supposed to be the places caring for him.

    <TEXT>I estimate the cost of his care alone to have cost about  #163;1.9m based on the average day cost for a place at one [regular acute inpatient unit](https://www.cchr.org.uk/cost-detained-psychiatric-ward-treated/) but would likely be a fair bit higher due to it being a high secure forensic unit. According to a 2007 published report available [here](https://www.mentalhealth.org.uk/search/?query=Cost+of+autism amp;op=Search) into the costs around caring for those with an Autism Spectrum Disorder, the lifetime cost in the most severe cases were around  #163;4.7m and around  #163;2.9m for those who are more high functioning. It's cost very close to that range already for him yet he's only 31 years old now, that cost will probably need to be at least doubled too because I doubt he'll be able to cope after all the institutionalisation and abuse. I see the point you're making though but given the statistics I fear it's closer to lazy reasoning from government/s that's ruining so many lives  #128532;</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I actually used to do this quite often when I was in my teens. I'm guessing it was some form of OCD combined with being a kind of comforting coping mechanism. I used to feel very depressed and also pressured to act on plans but I knew I could last out longer by just knowing that I always had what was necessary on me so that potentially I could do it at any moment - I guess I felt some kind of panic or that I'd feel less comforted if I didn't have the means to do it in the way I wanted to. How are you truly feeling, besides this behaviour? Or perhaps how do you feel about this behaviour too? Do you feel it's keeping you safe from definitively acting out or is it very troubling?</TEXT>

    <TEXT>That sounds like it's rather troubling generally rather than episodically so it's definitely something you should bring up as sometimes a side effect of antidepressants are increased suicidal thoughts so it may potentially be amplifying what was already there. My advice for mentioning that you realise it isnt normal behaviour, is to not mention that.I am someone who is considered insightful, I'm always called 'intelligent' by anyone in services which in my experience has been a passive-aggresive way of telling me that since I'm not what they'd consider 'stupid' then I must not have 'real' problems. If you do wish to mention that then really make sure you don't minimise your experience, it's kind of like a benefits assessment where you have to mention the worst possibilities that could happen for you in order for a chance to be taken as seriously as is needed. It'll be great to hear back from you in a day or two, whenever and if you're ready, whether good or bad  #128578;</TEXT>

    <TEXT>That wait certainly isn't ideal but perhaps to be expected especially with all that's going on currently. Nothing to lose by seeing how things feel once the sessions start happening and maybe if they can see that you're reacting well or aren't reacting badly to it then they'll offer more(?). The thing with these therapies though is that you've got to really work on it outside of sessions too, it's hard when perhaps you're already exhausted from dealing with these issues but you're right that things won't change unless you consciously work with it. I'd suggest to go along with the offer with an open mind, see what you can learn or gain as even just a single word or phrase can triggger us to feel or think or view things differently. Ask in advance if you may be able to be offered more sessions if things go well, if things are going well and you're not offered more then I'd suggest contacting a mental health advocate  #128578;</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Yeah I get what you mean, the frustration with the limitations of what can be offered when facing something that seems never-ending. I used to deal with severe depression myself - wouldn't bother making food or washing my own clothes and felt like I had nothing to talk about except my depression. Then some situations occurred which forced a change of environment which changed the level and types of interactions I had, which changed how I felt and my perspective on things. For some people they may have depression that persists all throughout their life but I'd just suggest to not underestimate the drastic domino-effect changes that can occur from just one change of situation. Therapy may help you to make a change which could then potentially alter the course or degree of your depression. I know much of the time any suggestion just sounds hopeless but I think that hopelessness is more of a reflection of the depression itself rather than the potential of change that the suggestion can bring. Just keep as much of an open mind as possible - including having a back-up plan and trying new suggested things which can offer the chance of change for you as if it works it'll be well worth it!</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Interesting points raised under the genetics section which I didn't know about! Also:  gt; The increased prevalence of anxiety and this all or nothing thinking style are also risk factors linked with eating disorders. For example you might believe that you can only be fat or thin and that there is no in-between, a middle ground where you are healthy. That's a very good point, I was never diagnosed with an eating disorder but I still find myself thinking that way quite often come to think of it. I also have found my experience with this issue to be similar to having quit smoking - that although I have given up and am living healthier, it requires a concerted effort to not fall back into those habits and have had to learn when to catch myself slipping/what my triggers are which could often happen without realising. I suppose that 'either/or' type thinking can also make us believe that we're either ill/suffering *or* healthy, which in a way can be bad for when in either situation without added insight or context</TEXT>

    <TEXT>It's probably healthy that it's something that *bothers* you as that can enable you to change that around easier but if it becomes something that *consumes* you then it makes it harder to turn that around because rather than the focus being on the unemployment or the years you havnt been active, the focus is on being consumed. You're worth more than your past or your employment status, there is more to you and life itself than just our pasts or our employment. Its understandable that you feel the way that you do but that's where I think therapy may come in useful for your case, to tweak that style/pattern of thinking in the right direction. You may not have spotted them but at the end of my stickied master post, I added this [free IAPT workbooks and resouces link](http://cedar.exeter.ac.uk/iapt/iaptinterventions/) which may help get you in the mood/mindframe or help with what you may expect from your upcoming therapy sessions</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Hey there. As someone who has used CAMHS in the past and has had bad experiences, I understand the frustration and it's clear that something needs to be done about it in order for young people to get the treatment they deserve so it's admirable that people are trying. If you want my advice though, I wouldn't go ahead with the name 'Cancel CAMHS' because it gives the impression that you want to get rid of it entirely rather than change what exists for the better - just think about what CAMHS literally stands for..I think with that name it may attract the wrong type of attention and become a bit toxic. As I said though, I understand the frustration entirely!</TEXT>

The sad part is that she likely does have a very good point which is probably something that was already at boiling point before this recent death and that the timing was just terribly judged. I'm quite strong on holding people/organisations accountable for their failings in this area and often it has proven necessary to bring these issues to light otherwise there wouldn't be any incentive for change, however, this case I chose to share due to it's local high profile and due to the issues surrounding nursing which people can share their opinions on rather than to shame this nurse.

    <TEXT>Perhaps one idea could be that your partner could sit in on a potential session/s you have so that it might help them see where the anger is coming from and to see what things are helpful or where you're making progress so that it can reduce those incidences happening. That's only if it's something they specifically wanted or would feel they'd benefit from though. There is an organisation you could contact called [respect](https://www.respect.uk.net/) which offers advice, information and support on 0808 802 4040. You can also email them on info@respectphoneline.org.uk or use their live chat on their website. Live chat is available Tuesdays and Thursdays 10am #8211;4pm. They run programmes across the country to help you understand and change your behaviour. There is also [The Freedom Programme](https://freedomprogramme.co.uk/) which is there to offer courses to those who want to change their abusive behaviour If things start getting out of control in the meantime then do consider booking with a GP to see what other options are available (medications, therapy/counselling etc) or to let off some steam every now and then by calling somewhere such as the Samaritans so that the anger doesn't reach boiling point quite as quickly. If you may have an underlying condition due to your childhood experiences such as PTSD which can potentially trigger uncontrollable anger then it's also important to address that too - it's one of those issues where addressing one without the other may make it very difficult to work through</TEXT>

They may be able to assess it themselves or refer you to someone who can but they cant help you with something that they're not aware is happening. I hope that the resources can help the situation for the better for you both  #128578;</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I'm guessing it could be because it's something that could be considered inconvenient as even people who have a more-than-basic understanding of mental health issues can respond to this in a way that suggests someone who is suicidal is attention seeking. Even manipulation is often not actually what it seems - it's a word that can often be used to dismiss the underlying reasons as to why someone is distressed enough to act in such a way. How many people with mental health issues are told they are manipulative for feeling so upset and lacking in support that they feel the only option is to stand on the wrong side of a bridge or self harm etc? I'm sure there are a minority of people who would potentially do it to genuinely manipulate others but I think when we use that word nonchalantly it is almost like we are internalising the negative stigma towards us - so that's not a dig at you but just an observation as I think many of us can easily be drawn into that</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Agreed. Any of us could be considered attention seeking by someone else at any given time as there will always be someone with issues that are deemed more serious than our own - the more important factor is how are we are actually dealing with the issues we face. There are people who are quadriplegic who function better than myself and also people with mental health issues that are deemed less serious than my own who have committed suicide. Manipulation in my view is more often than not a form of how certain people are dealing with their underlying issues which really requires more support rather than less/being dismissed which will likely make them act that way more in order to get the help they require, that's just my opinion though!</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Hey, first of all thanks for persevering and doing your best to try and help your partner with the issues she is having, I'm sure it is appreciated in one way or another! Have you tried a different GP? Do you have the financial means to see a private psychiatrist as a one-off? There is a downside that they won't be aware of any previous history/notes and so can only judge her based on a 1-2 hour session but it may help in getting things moving in the right direction if your GPs wont refer you somewhat quickly to a community mental health team. Playing down symptoms seems to be a very British type of issue as opposed to the US style where it seems quite easy to get a diagnosis. I suspect that it is often in their minds that people might fake illness in order to get higher rates of benefits and other such cynical thinking, that's just my opinion though! I wouldn't want to hazard a guess as to what your partner may be dealing with but it sounds like something which would require assessment from a community mental health team (not a Mental Health Act assessment but just a casual assessment over a period of time)</TEXT>

Some people just come across more composed than others and there are many factors which can play a part in making an accurate diagnosis which is often why diagnostic critera for some mental health conditons actually require assessment/presence of symptoms over a set period of time before diagnosing someone</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Hey there, sorry to hear that things aren't going too well for either of you currently. Would your boyfriend be open to speaking to someone about it whether that be a GP or someone from the Samaritans? I suppose that could be posed as getting an outsiders perspective, if he is clearly upset and maybe willing to accept that it could be his mental health getting a lot worse again? If he isn't accepting of any help and he's still a danger to himself then it will be a lot more damaging for him to be left with potentially untreated psychosis than for him to not appreciate that you've intervened, which he may understand the reasoning for after treatment. You could try calling the NHS non emergency number 111 for advice if you're not sure whether you should intervene or not</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Some very interesting points!  gt; a UK study that found that above 18C, every 1C increase in temperature is associated with a 3.8% increase in the incidence of suicide and a 5% increase in violent suicide. In fact, during the 1995 heatwave in the UK, suicide increased by a staggering 46.9%. Similar results have also been observed in other parts of the world.  gt; Taking certain psychiatric medications can inhibit your natural ability to regulate temperature and you may find it more difficult to sweat effectively.  gt; People who live with severe mental or cognitive illness might struggle to dress appropriately for the heat or work out how to cool themselves down.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>That's awesome, feel free to share it here if/when you do decide to blog about it! I understand what you mean, I also got a lot of benefit from playing video games as it was more of a harmless escapism back then (having to have friends come over for multiplayer games, none of these endless add-on purchases and better gameplay in my opinion). I did learn how to spell better at an early age because of it though, as well as differentiating words by meaning/spelling that sound the same but with different meanings e.g mourning and morning. Those things will at least still be something to benefit from despite some of the potential modern hindrances</TEXT>

It's hard enough for mods of big subs to manage the content on their own sub, let alone when others are linking to third party content. Luckily this is a manageable sub so I'm fine with people sharing their content or research studies as long as it is related to mental health and/or therapy, preferably UK based or at least potentially relevant to people that are from here. Yeah swings and roundabouts, the graphics nowadays are phenomenal considering what they were like only 20 odd years ago. Saves space when being able to buy a game without the actual game too. I guess that's what gives that special nostalgic feeling though, the fact that things used to be quite different, it gives it a special place reserved in our hearts  #128578;</TEXT>

I checked the [NICE guidelines](https://bnf.nice.org.uk/drug/duloxetine.html) for Duloxetine which state that the dosage for major depressive disorder is 60mg daily. It is up to 120mg daily for those who have generalised anxiety disorder or diabetic neuropathy. Perhaps they haven't diagnosed you with generalised anxiety disorder and so are following the guidelines for major depressive disorder? If you're 25 or older then it will often be more difficult to refer to a mental health team because there are stricter criteria for being referred there. Which symptoms specifically are troubling you the most?</TEXT>

I always assumed it was only phone call support available which I'd always find difficult but it's great to see text, email and online support now too. I have a feeling it's all things that have been bubbling for way too long and it was actually before the lockdown when people should have been able to have easy access and knowledge of all the available services..its got to the point now where so many people are at too much of a crisis point to be helped in that manner which is very worrying considering the lack of beds issue which was already horrendous before this Coronavirus situation came along</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Sorry to hear about the past experiences you've had, hopefully if nothing else it has become a little easier/more manageable with time. I wasn't suprised of the fact people who have experienced these types of maltreatment are more likely to potentially have more health conditions but it was the amount in the difference that shocked me. Sometimes for some of us it can be easy to normalise our experiences because its what we were used to and it takes an objective perspective to really highlight that it isn't normal and it isn't something that only impacts us during the time of the maltreatment, so acknowledging the potential extent of the impact can be helpful to seeking help when needed I feel</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Hey there, have you had any of these thoughts since two years ago? Do you have any of these types of thoughts currently but perhaps about other people or would you say that experience was more of a one-off? Unless you're clearly currently an immediate risk to yourself or others then it's unlikely they will take any forceful action. They will also not notify that person due to confidentiality rules, though perhaps they would be allowed to organise them to be notified by other agencies if for example they had some kind of restraining order against you or there was some criminal history between you both</TEXT>

    <TEXT>That's good news, I'm glad that it's calmed down a bit for you and that neither you or anybody else came to any harm because of that experience. Has your therapist given their opinion on the situation, perhaps reassuring you that it was an understandable thing to deal with considering the circumstances, or perhaps they felt it was not a reasonable/expected reaction? If you're comfortable enough to talk about it further and it's something you'd like to do then there's no reason why not but it also seems there's no particular pressure to do so either, so it's entirely up to what feels best for you to do with regards to mentioning it</TEXT>

Unless you are currently having thoughts or displaying behaviour which shows you're an immediate risk to yourself or others then I wouldn't be concerned about being sectioned - it's hard enough to get that kind of help when begging for it! It's for you to decide in this case whether the pros outweighs the cons but if your mind is telling you to tell someone then it's probably worth doing that for the peace of mind by itself.

I know that they can at least refer you back to specific NHS services so I dont see why it would be a problem to refer you on to another psychiatrist unless there is a specific protocol I'm not aware of. If not then your GP should be able to do that and I would assume they'd be able to do that without having to see you face to face so that could save a bit of a wait too.

    <TEXT>Hey there! Sorry to hear about your experiences of not being able to see progress from previous therapy and your lack of trust with the mental health team. Sadly I think there are also many other people out there who feel the same way regarding the lack of trust, if that's any consolation. It sounds like you have many desires/aspects you wish to change regarding your mental health which can probably seem very overwhelming but it's good that you're able to identify what you'd like to address and how you think that could be done (such as being referred to a specialist unit). I'm sure that it will be somewhat of a relief for them as I suspect it's a lot more common for people to not have any clue about what to do next, which requires extra work/time in itself. It's great that you've already written notes as that's what I would have suggested anyway. The best you can do is just be completely honest because at least if the appointment doesn't go to plan, at least you can say that you did mention all that you needed to and there was nothing more you could do. It's understandable that it feels scary especially considering past bad experiences but every professional is different and it only takes one to help us change our lives around. The worst case scenario isn't ideal but it will be back to status quo, whereas the potential benefits far outweigh the potential worst case scenario (status quo) in this case, so its worth being direct about what you'd like and how you think things will be without that type of support in the long-term. You may find something like [this](http://cedar.exeter.ac.uk/iapt/iaptinterventions/) helpful to look at whilst you're waiting, or perhaps as something to refer to every so often</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Hey there, sorry to hear about the difficulties you've had so far with navigating the mental health services. I totally understand the frustration with seemingly only being able to get help when there's a crisis, at which point unnecessary damage has likely been done in some form or another. Do you know what kind of support you would benefit from the most? I dont know if you may have some specific idea of something you've heard of which you feel may work for you? If you're now a considered an adult rather than a youth (under 25) then the criteria will often be a lot stricter, my local adult mental health team for example only takes cases that are 'severe and enduring' which in practice is mostly Bipolar, Schizophrenia or another chronic mental health disorder which causes the person severe issues requiring hospitalisations. Unfortunately I have no personal experience with private health insurance so I wouldn't be able to give you any suggestions based on personal experience but hopefully someone else may be able to help with that aspect</TEXT>

    <TEXT>No worries! Is that from a referral from a GP in the past? Have you had any appointments since to check whether you're still on the list/there hasn't been any miscommunication or errors? If there's one thing to come out of this whole current situation with Coronavirus, it's that there will be more focus on mental health and how serious it can get which will hopefully be prompting more timely support for those who are felt to need it quite quickly. It can be a bit of a 'postcode lottery' but I was speaking with another person through this sub who managed to get the support he needed which was quite a lot of support and quite quick which suprised me due to usually how difficult it can be. I can understand your hesitance due to your past experience but each time is a new opportunity and it only takes one to completely turn your life around. Worst case in this context is that things remain the same but the best is that you could walk away with all the support you feel you need, it's mostly about weighing up the gains vs losses in these circumstances really. If you feel you would rather go through some therapeutic things yourself then there is an [IAPT workbooks resource website](http://cedar.exeter.ac.uk/iapt/iaptinterventions/) which you may find helpful but I would suggest to get back into contact with your GP and be totally honest with them about what you feel you need and what you feel might happen if you dont feel you can get the support you need, if applicable. If you are becoming rather stressed and need an outside perspective then dont hesitate to contact the Samaritans on 116 123 or Shout 24/7 text service which you can find information about [here](https://www.giveusashout.org/)</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Good to hear that you know for sure that you're still on the list and that you feel able to use the Samaritans. Fingers crossed that it's not too much longer before you can access therapy but in the meantime it might be helpful to use those resources that I linked to and also looking into mindfulness. There are also phone apps that are often recommended such as calm and headspace. These options may not feel as effective as being able to work face-to-face with a therapist but it's good to pass the time, to be able to practice before the 'real thing' and to get into the right mindframe as therapy success is quite heavily reliant on us being able and willing to apply what we are taught by the therapist so getting in the mindframe beforehand might help a little bit both now and at the point you start therapy too</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Hey there, thanks for reaching out and also for bringing awareness to this competition - I wasn't aware of it until now. You know yourself best but I'd say that if you tend to experience anxiety *after* doing something which then negatively impacts your physical and/or mental health then I would probably suggest to avoid this as I tend to experience anxiety in that way and know what that can be like. If you're someone who tends to experience anxiety *before* doing something and then feel better afterwards then I'd suggest to go for it. Thats just my personal opinion  #128578;</TEXT>

    <TEXT>It could be perhaps that she has a [personality disorder](https://www.rcpsych.ac.uk/mental-health/problems-disorders/personality-disorder) as these can vary from mild to severe and can cause problematic behaviours which can sometimes come across as being stubborn/manipulative etc. If it is indeed a personality disorder then it is often helpful to research into what can cause a personality disorder and then onto what is helpful for that particular cause - it may seem tempting and reasonable to react negatively but when you react negatively it can often exacerbate these symptoms and it can become a vicious cycle. Often these behaviours can seem deliberate but are actually in response to something that is triggering. There are therapies which can help treat personality disorders but whether the funding is available or not is another question, it's a bit of a postcode lottery. I'm not a mental health professional though so I'd suggest to ask her whether she's seeking a diagnosis so that she can then relay that onto the mental health team before she gets discharged back to primary care</TEXT>

Psychotic episodes briefer than those seen in full blown Schizophrenia are possible, so that could potentially be a driving factor behind the psychosis if she does indeed have Schizotypal personality disorder and antipsychotic treatment should help with that, though it may take a few weeks to notice the effect. You have my sympathy regarding poor mental health treatment/misdiagnosis as I have been through the same myself. Unfortunately unless she is an immediate risk to herself or others qualifying her for inpatient treatment then there is little else you can do but to try and research into it further and see what tips you can pick up on how best to deal with the situation for yourself and her.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Yeah that doesn't sound ideal for anyone involved, though unfortunately isn't the type of immediate risk that would qualify for inpatient treatment. Immediate by the definition in the assessment would be that she has a plan to harm herself or others that she's willing/likely to carry out. I can understand the frustration you feel but as you say, it doesn't sound like the issue is an Autism Spectrum disorder or another learning disability. It's hard enough to get a solid/correct diagnosis anyway and when they do diagnose, it's often after feeling they are being quite certain. It's not entirely necessary to have a learning disability for support though, [This](https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/social-care-and-support-guide/money-work-and-benefits/when-the-council-might-pay-for-your-care/) page explains about when the council might pay for/towards your care, I'd suggest to give that a read.</TEXT>

IAPT is often suggested for adults who have problematic issues but do not meet the criteria for being referred to an adult mental health team as that is quite strict. There are therapies available for those connected to mental health teams but it often requires the person to be stable and the funding isn't always there in order for the person to take the opportunity. I haven't personally tried IAPT though so I cannot speak from personal experience but perhaps someone else here will be able to offer their experience.</TEXT>

If it was rather expensive, was there any kind of payment plan available in order to accommodate for perhaps not readily having lots of money, such as spreading the cost a bit or a bit of a reduction for booking more sessions etc?</TEXT>

    <TEXT>That's a good way of viewing/rationalising it, I'm glad it's worked out for you! Are you still actively applying any techniques now that you learned from your therapy or do you feel that you don't need to actively do any of that currently? Yeah it's a very individualistic type of thing, one therapist could be deemed as ineffective by one person but a lifesaver by another. Hopefully you're able to get another recommendation worth pursuing that will be better suited for your partner soon though!</TEXT>

It sounds like it might be beneficial to speak to someone so that it doesn't all become so built-up that self harm becomes a way of coping with these issues. Self harm is only really a way of punishing ourselves or masking issues that are happening, both of which doesn't address the underlying issues and so it just tends to continue on Don't hesitate to try using one of the helplines in the pinned master post on this page, there's people out there who will listen and it might help to get another perspective  #128578;</TEXT>

Its easier said than done but try not to stress too much as if they were going to do that they would have arranged someone to see you within about 4 hours which is the emergency criteria. It sounds like perhaps you have some complex issues/circumstances which might make it difficult for them to decide which team is best to deal with your case</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Yeah it can be really tough trying to get better within the NHS system at times - it can sometimes feel like you need to stay unwell to get help because if you show signs of getting better then it's a reason to discharge you which can be particularly difficult for people with BPD or PTSD due to trauma/abandonment issues. It's a bit of a postcode lottery though and a lot of factors involved in it either working out or not. I just found a more generalised UK site called The Survivors Trust which will be able to offer you support if needed [here](https://www.thesurvivorstrust.org/covid-19-are-you-concerned-about-wearing-a-mask) and it also has shown an interesting alternative idea for a face mask which may interest you!

    <TEXT>It's very unfortunate that even after 2 months this situation is still a risky situation that requires more appropriate action to help lessen the risk but I suppose that slow progress is still progress, especially considering the Coronavirus situation. Have they given him an appointment letter or any kind of timeframe for when to expect to be seen by mental health services? Unfortunately people's hands will likely be tied, each service will likely say that unless he has actually done something dangerous or is likely to immediately do it then the process just has to go down the generic route. Im guessing it's less about safeguarding and more that it'd be seen as a waste of money to try to prosecute someone for a non violent crime who either won't be deemed fit for trial or who would be found to benefit better from mental health care anyway. I do understand your frustration though, it's certainly not ideal for anyone involved by the sounds of it! The best you can do is probably what you're already doing and that if he says something which suggests he will urgently harm himself or is seriously neglecting himself then to contact 111 for advice or 999 for an ambulance so he can perhaps be sectioned or at least assessed</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I understand how frustrating it is when that happens as it's happened many times to me where a psychiatrist has stated something different to what actually happened/was said in the appointment and has even seemingly not consulted with other professionals dealing with the case to provide an accurate report. The important thing is just to focus on what you know to be true and to focus on addressing those things. If anyone has any queries based on previous letters or if you wish to outright clarify anything then you always have that opportunity during the following appointment whether its with the same person or not. I realise it'll still be very frustrating but there's many reasons why this may happen such as lack of communication, high caseloads to deal with so difficult to remember everything, not much time to write the letter etc. It's likely not to do with not caring as most train for these professions because they care/want to help, however, they can be very constrained and bogged down with work due to working for such a big and in-demand organisation that isn't being funded correctly. Your care coordinator will likely want what's in your best interest and for you to feel you're able to access what you need to access - including the complaints process. PALs wont think you're crazy for making a legitimate complaint, there is more info on PALs [here](https://www.nhs.uk/common-health-questions/nhs-services-and-treatments/what-is-pals-patient-advice-and-liaison-service/) if you wish to complain.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>It's understandable that you'd feel a bit put-off from past experiences but if you give up on giving it another go at seeing your GP then who do you think will be able to help you and how? (Referring to the title of your post) Even for those who know what treatment is best for them, it does often still take perseverance either with therapy, medication or both etc. It's understandably something you'll probably feel little energy towards but it's worth at least being totally honest with your GP - depending on a few factors they may even be taking mental health issues a bit more seriously given the current situation. Death is something we are all guaranteed no matter what, so its worth chucking everything we've got at our issues because sometimes all it takes is one person, phrase or action to change everything completely</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Good to hear that you feel safe on this sub and that you've had the experience of not feeling people here have been judgemental towards you. If it helps to know then I have also had similar comments said to me by those types of fleeting professionals who don't have anything more to do with you after that one time/session. It's definitely not okay that the woman who assessed you treated you like that with thoughtless comments though, I imagine its something that will always be upsetting/frustrating no matter how many times it happens and you're more than welcome to make an official complaint to PALs if you wished to do that. I understand that it's difficult to feel like the extent of your condition isn't truly being acknowledged, however, if you're currently getting specialised support then I think it's more beneficial for you to focus on getting the most out of the support you're currently receiving if it's still targeting the issues you're dealing with and then if it doesn't work, to then explain why (where you could then mention that you think it's a binge eating disorder and be reassessed if necessary).</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I think really it comes down to how much of an immediate risk of suicide you think you are as to whether A amp;E is the best option. If you're honest with them then they'll likely want you to be assessed, however, I feel that not much will be done if they feel that you dont have a plan that you are likely to act on very soon. That's not to say you're not deserving of help and that you're not going through some terrible experiences with your mental health though. That is just me being honest based on how strict the criteria is for hospitalisation unfortunately. They may decide that you should see a crisis team (this team may have a different name in your area) who may decide to see you once a day for maybe a few days to a week or so just to try and curb the issues going on currently but it's typically just a short term intervention in order to prevent hospitalisation. I would hope that the hospital staff treated you with the same respect as anyone else though it has been known to be a bit of a mixed bag for those attending A amp;E for mental health problems when people there are expecting physical health problems. Hopefully with all the awareness over the past few years there is more understanding of people attending A amp;E for serious mental health problems now though. If you feel that you have a plan that you will likely act on then I would suggest to go to A amp;E, if not I would suggest to contact your case worker (I think you mentioned being involved with your local mental health team?) to say that things are becoming worse - Pressure from friends/family can help quite a lot regarding progression with that too. There are also quite a lot of helplines/resources on the pinned masterpost at the top of [r/MentalHealthUK](https://www.reddit.com/r/MentalHealthUK/) which I moderate if you need a third party to listen to your concerns etc.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Hey there, sorry to hear about your past abusive relationship and also the difficult situation you have found yourself in. I'm certainly not here to judge, just to give everyone here the best support/advice I can based on personal experience and knowledge. If it's any consolation then you won't be charged with anything revolving around that person being underage as the legal age here in the UK is 16 years old. I personally wouldn't consider involving myself in any gray area's like that but technically that is still lawful assuming there is consent etc. It is however not advisable to create fake personas presumably using pictures of other people because it is a variation of fraud. Considering you have now deleted everything, that you're not continuing on with this and have seemingly been shook up enough to be deterred, I'd say there are much more lucrative cases out there than yours. I can understand why you'd be concerned but *even if* this person wanted to get you into trouble, mitigating circumstances would need to be taken into account *if* it went to court. If it was your first offence then that is also a mitigating factor, along with remorse. Everyone gets their chance to have their defence *if* they can confidently assume that they have enough evidence to successfully prosecute in the first instance. Dont forget that these things cost a lot of time, money and other resources too so they'll want to be confident. It's easier said than done but the best thing is to fill your days up with distractions, make plenty of plans and before you know it today will seem very distant. I know it doesn't feel like that now, but it will. Please refer to the Automoderator comment for any extra help/advice that you may benefit from.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Thanks for the clarification! A rather odd separation of the laws there which I don't think will help those who are underage nor the other person involved due to the confusion it probably causes for those who may even just be naive rather than predatory, though either way it still should ultimately be the responsibility of the older person involved to check and ensure they're not breaking any laws there. I'd agree in terms of maybe joining some groups to meet other more like-minded and similar aged people in the community which may ultimately help with the issues relating to your past relationship too.</TEXT>

If the sub grows bigger and requires quite lengthy and specific rules typed out on there to safeguard then I will amend my rules on there. So far everyone has been great on there and so luckily there hasn't been a demand for being too tight on the rules yet. I agree that nobody should take any advice there as professional advice unless it's actually from a professional, even then they should still be seen. I also dont think anyone should portray themselves as a professional or capable of giving professional advice/replacing professional advice, often people will mention this in their comments to others naturally though.

    <TEXT>I am making a post on behalf of someone who contacted me in order to hopefully find people who are able to participate in their PhD research study. There is no obligation to participate but I'd appreciate if anyone who feel they may be eligible to check out the information provided to me below: [Here](https://lancasteruni.eu.qualtrics.com/jfe/form/SV_8xpr2mueE7mDYMt) is a link to the study flyer which gives an overview of the study.

[Here](https://lancasteruni.eu.qualtrics.com/jfe/form/SV_3IdfvVoqjbT729n) is the link to take part in the study. **Who can participate?** You are eligible to take part in the research if *all of the following* apply: * A first-time mum who delivered a full term (between the 37 and 42 weeks of pregnancy) and a healthy singleton baby within the last 12-24 months. * Residing in the UK. * Between the age range of 18-45 years. * Experienced any form of Postpartum Emotional Distress (PPED) in the first year following childbirth and now identify herself in a state of recovery. * Have not been pregnant or delivered a baby after the first one. **What does participation in the study involve?** * 15-20 minutes for reading study information form, consent form and filling in the participant information form. * Reflecting back on your experience with Postpartum Emotional Distress (PPED) from birth to the first birthday of your child for filling in an online reflective journal through a web-link which will take an hour. You can do it in one sitting or can take up to two weeks in case you need more time to reflect and recall. * Interview for 45-60 minutes via Zoom video conferencing software or telephonic call (as per participants convenience) on a time and date mutually agreed by the participant and the researcher.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I've heard quite a variety of experiences so far, some people who have been told to just go to A amp;E instead if they need to see a doctor and others who have said their GP has dealt with it quite well. I think this is a good thing especially as it sends very mixed signals when saying that people shouldn't bottle things up/avoid seeing a doctor but to then have things made quite difficult when it comes to being able to see one. I can understand the desire to encourage phone call appointments for those who do not need to see a GP as it will potentially reduce the number of people out-and-about, going to other places there and back etc. I can also understand though people feeling annoyed that some GPs have refused to see people face-to-face when it's against their ethics. I wonder whether it may be more related to underfunding (PPE) as opposed to simply not wanting to see others? It seems strange that someone in that profession would during a pandemic not want to see their patients</TEXT>

It sucks that they couldn't cover for you rather than letting you go completely, I hope that in future you're able to find somewhere that values you more than that.

    <TEXT>I'm glad that your other half is supportive at least. It's tough being on the side of needing the support and having people ghost you, I like to think people just genuinely don't know how to deal with it rather than deliberately being unhelpful, hopefully that type of thing will be more of a past issue with the increasing awareness of mental health issues and how to deal with them. If you think about it, we are all currently taking one for team for future generations which assigns us all a great purpose even when we are feeling useless because of the way other people are treating us! I'm not any kind of professional but personally I'd think a counselling and meds combo would be a pretty worthwhile thing to try out considering it seems you'd have issues that would respond better to one more than the other, but likely both of them nonetheless. Have you considered contacting a place such as [Cruse Bereavement?](https://www.cruse.org.uk/) there seems to be a lot of information on their website and their helpline number is: 0808 808 1677 (Mon - Fri. 9am-5pm) Good to hear you've got some money stashed away to cover the unemployment. If you need any financial advice/help at some point, or perhaps even in anticipation of needing it, then do try contacting your local [Citizens Advice](https://www.citizensadvice.org.uk/about-us/contact-us/contact-us/search-for-your-local-citizens-advice/)</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Hi everyone! I just thought I'd raise awareness of my [subreddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/MentalHealthUK/) which is small but growing and whilst it is still small I am keeping it active daily with UK specific mental health related news articles and resources. The pinned masterpost at the top of the sub is packed with helplines, links to resouces and information for anyone UK based who needs it. I am committed to growing the sub until it grows bigger and easier for people to meet other like-minded people with similar experiences. If you have any feedback then I am open to taking any suggestions you might have. Thanks for reading  #128578;</TEXT>

I agree with what you're saying, however, I personally think that rather than them *actually* ruining it for people who genuinely need it, it's actually just used as an excuse by the assessors/government to legitimise the way they treat those who genuinely need it. If these people are trained professionals, it really shouldn't be too difficult to split the two after all the paperwork and assessment</TEXT>

My next step was to take on further more creative ideas such as what you suggested, so that is very much appreciated. It might be a little early yet but if you really want to get a good idea if there's currently enough demand for that, feel free to create/post a poll here and if successful it can be sorted!

    <TITLE>Post reports clarification</TITLE>
    <DATE>2020-09-19 17:49:03</DATE>
    <TEXT>After a few recent reports, I thought I would make a post specifically addressing recent reports and making clearer clarifications so that I can then edit and/or link this in future reported posts if necessary. I appreciate that people care enough to want to see the sub actively regulated but when the reports are used in certain situations it can sometimes cause more issues than it solves which I will explain below. **Spamming:** Only report spamming if the person is spamming here specifically. This is because even if they've posted here but also lots of other places, it doesn't mean it still isn't helpful to people here. Even just a quote or a picture can be a source for inspiration so I feel it's important to keep these posts. **Confidential information:** Generally it is best to just seek help for yourself, however, if a loved one is in distress and needing advice/support then it is only advisable to try and seek it, as I'm sure many people would for their loved one or as many people would appreciate others doing for them. Only report if the person has posted identifying information about this person e.g the persons full real name, their address, phone number, picture (of someone else) etc. **Threats of suicide:** Please only report threats of suicide if someone is making a threat in bad taste/an unreasonable manner so that I can remove it and message them with my thoughts on that. If you report for someone making a threat of suicide or seems likely to attempt suicide then it may cause the post to be removed, therefore making it harder for them to receive support from people here. A better alternative option for this would be to go onto their profile and click the 'get them help and support' option.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>That would be awesome! I appreciate it may feel a bit of a risk but I've taken the measure of preventing people with -2 karma or less from posting or commenting here. If it becomes necessary I can also ensure that accounts have to be a certain age before posting - currently leaving that as it is in case anyone urgently wants to share and doesn't want to be identified via their main account or doesn't yet have an account. Anyone who discriminates will be banned too. Hopefully you're able to find some good ones there - as a professional you may be interested in a recent addition to that list which is [The Masked AMHP](https://themaskedamhp.blogspot.com/?m=1) who also has done a few Youtube videos now too, if you aren't already aware of his blog. I'm always open to adding people's suggestions to the helplines and/or resources list so feel free to get back to me anytime if there's anything you'd like to see up there! I do currently have an automod message which appears at the top of every text submission suggesting that anyone who needs extra support should contact the Samaritans on 116 123, to text Shout to 85258 or to call 999/attend A amp;E if self harm has been done or likely to be done. If you'd like me to ammend this message in any way then I'll take on the suggestion  #128578;</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Hey there, sorry to hear about the issues you're having between all of the different services which sounds both confusing and frustrating. Have you asked the CMHT to refer you to a psychologist within the local mental health team who will be able to diagnose? - it isn't really within the remit of the case worker who comes to see you to diagnose but they can provide extra info for the psychologist to diagnose. Have you considered calling up the GiC and asking them to contact your CMHT to tell them the situation?</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Great comment/advice, I've experienced it myself first-hand too. Plus if the decision is overturned the money is backdated to when you first claimed so you'll get given a lump sum if it's overturned. [Citizens Advice](https://www.citizensadvice.org.uk/about-us/contact-us/contact-us/search-for-your-local-citizens-advice/) is one place that can help but they may be quite overwhelmed currently. There are some good resources online though, specifically [turn2us](https://www.turn2us.org.uk/Benefit-guides/Claiming-Personal-Independence-Payment/Fill-in-PIP-form) which I have used before myself.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Hey there, congrats on getting the job! My advice would be not to put too much pressure on yourself - that's coming from someone who always does that which always ends badly yet I always repeat it. I think some people are just "that kind of person" and it's quite engrained, so perhaps it's more about addressing a way to lessen the impact rather than being able to totally change it. Perhaps you could benefit from seeing what help you could get from your GP regarding maybe certain mental health related support groups you could attend or if you prefer self-support then maybe practicing mindfulness, looking through IAPT self-helf booklets and/or meditation - a few resources for all of these can be found towards the end of the pinned masterpost if you're interested in exploring any  #128578;</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Hey there, sorry to hear about all the bad experiences you've had both lately and not-so-lately. It sounds like perhaps you could do with a bit of a break - have you considered applying for PIP so that you'll be able to have a period of time where you wont have to struggle quite so much to keep everything afloat? This may then enable you to be assessed as well if you're saying that being in employment is holding you back regarding that. Some people find work a helpful distraction though so I dont know if this advice is helpful for you or not. Have you received any specific support regarding your issues with bereavement? If not you could try contacting Cruse Bereavement (www.crusebereavementcare.org.uk) which can be contacted on 0844 477 9400 Mon to Fri, 9am to 5pm. This may also potentially help with trauma in a way because sometimes negative things that are happening currently can trigger flashbacks/nightmares etc of the past even if not directly related.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Hey there, well done for reaching out/seeking help for the issues you're facing! I have no experience with BUPA but a mental well-being practitioner is someone who acts as a triage service to other mental health services/treatments but can offer low level support for those who require that. They are well qualified people but they're not really there as something long term, they do a lot of behind-the-scenes work. I imagine that during the assessment they may ask about whether there were any problems with your birth, your school life, family history, past relationships, drug/alcohol use etc. Some questions may seem intrusive but there are certain things which are highly associated with certain conditons. It will likely be more of an info gathering session which will determine where you should be referred rather than anything that feels supportive/helpful at the time. It may feel supportive/helpful but I have had experience of info gathering sessions and it made me feel quite mixed emotions and quite drained personally, so perhaps that's something to just potentially expect/be aware of!</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I think this article was more-so aimed towards people with depression and anxiety which impacts them to the degree that it's hard to look after themselves or to communicate etc. A condition can impact us all very differently. I am diagnosed with several 'serious' mental health conditions and I should probably already be dead based on the suicide rates for them all, however, there's people diagnosed with depression who are far more at risk of self neglect and suicide than me based on how it impacts them personally. I personally dont think it's our responsibility to help people feel comfortable about the fact we have conditions which impact our daily functioning or to justify ourselves to them. Some people will just have that view no matter what but that's on them to educate themselves or reach out such as what you're doing rather than be judgmental towards others.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>That's certainly the way I view it. If anything I feel it is a deflection and that it is in fact lazy to be in 2020, presumably with internet access with all info at their fingertips, yet to just decide to be judgemental instead. It's not on the other hand lazy to have a mental health condition beyond your control. When other people have assumed I'm just lazy, all it did was make me realise they needed to be cut out of my life rather than making me "less lazy" i.e suddenly recover from my long term mental health conditions. I think that people are worth more than their employment status, for example, if I ever was able to be employed it would be doing work a robot could do much more efficiently and reliably whereas without employment I can make a lot of difference here at least. I appreciate that there's people who value work though and that it is a helpful distraction for many people. There are still some initiatives which help people with mental health conditons that get back into work in a way that is actually delivered with compassion but many of these have been cut. All that cutting these services have done is left a 'black and white' contrast of either 'I'm fit for work and cannot get support' vs 'I will always need support and cannot work' without much middle-ground. It is unfortunately a consequence of the government priorities, all we can do is the best we can with what we've got left - I am open to people sharing petitions/activism ideas here though for if anyone was interested in making those kinds of changes.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Hey there, sorry to hear about your issues having developed into depression. Unfortunately your teachers can't help you with what they don't know is going on and if you pretend that things aren't getting bad then they may end up calling you out on the work being late/not as good as expected etc. I wouldn't have thought they'd tell anyone else unless they thought you were at risk of harming yourself - in which case I'd think they'd want to contact professionals or to make your parents aware that it is actually bad (which may help?). You could also mention to them that you dont feel it's worth telling your parents due to them not taking you seriously which could impact the way they were to explain things if they did tell them. Has things got worse since seeing your doctor? - if it has then I'd suggest to make another appointment and see what more they can offer, they could perhaps offer quicker options for you if they feel you're in a much riskier position</TEXT>

You mentioned not being sure about whether you'd be able to afford private counselling - [here](https://www.bacp.co.uk/search/Therapists) is the directory for BACP therapists which I just recently added to the resources list in the pinned masterpost. Support on the NHS is there to help, if you feel you need it (regardless of anything else) then that's all that matters. It's actually a much better option to make use of NHS resources before things potentially get bad because they are often easier to access for 'milder' conditions/situations, a GP may be able to refer you to IAPT services etc but they wont be able to do anything if they're not aware that that things are feeling so difficult for you.

    <TEXT>Hey there, sorry to hear that the date didn't go the way you'd hoped and that it's having an impact on your mental health. My opinion in this case based on what you've typed out is that it's not related to whether mental health is more stigmatised in Ireland or not but rather that it's her personal preference to move on. This may be for various reasons such as her simply not feeling the same way as you, her not needing any more friends and only seeking a relationship or her feeling that being honest and open is the best way to manage the situation. Sometimes when it comes down to dating it can seem like you're 'damned if you do and damned if you dont' unless both people feel exactly the same, which doesn't seem all that common. It sounds like you have the right intentions and I'm sure that if you are able to seek out mental health support groups in your country/area then you may find it easier to meet people who are also seeking friendship. It's nothing to feel stupid about but I feel that your deep desire may come across a little strong for some people - some people can interpret that as suspicious or creepy etc. I hope that you're able to find people who are like-minded and can give back to you what you would like to give to others  #128578;</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Hey there, sorry to hear that your moods are a bit all over the show at the moment. I have only slept about 2 hours in the past 3 days so my advice/comment may not be the best quality but I'll give it a go! Perhaps a method of dealing with this that may work for you is to just simply allow yourself to have a crappy day - to acknowledge that things feel turbulent and that may mean that you cant do X, Y or Z but that tomorrow will be a fresh opportunity where you can restart again. If things do get more serious though then please try to contact one the helpline/textlines available in the pinned masterpost. This isn't directly related to your specific emotions right now but I've personally found [this](http://lizandrewbrake.com/focusing-on-what-you-can-control/) type of focus/thinking can help with reigning things in a bit. It focuses on the '3 circles' - the circle of control, the circle of influence and the circle of concern. There is a diagram if you scroll down which I feel is quite nice in order to visualise the technique. I can relate with the turbulence though and it can really make it difficult to get a solid foothold when the ground underneath keeps shifting, so I definitely appreciate certain bits of advice are much easier said than done!</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Hey there, sorry to hear that your experience with the CMHT nurse was bad especially considering that it wasn't easy for you to get seen in the first place. If you want to get more official about the situation you can complain to PALs, information for that can be found [here](https://www.nhs.uk/common-health-questions/nhs-services-and-treatments/what-is-pals-patient-advice-and-liaison-service/) which explains the process. It's understandable that you'd feel put-off from starting the process again but it's totally possible that she was more of an exception to the rule rather than representative of the majority of the CMHT nurses there. If you're feeling that things are becoming worse/unmanageable then it's worth going back to your GP, explaining this situation and seeing what more can be done. I would hope that things are being taken a bit more seriously now considering the impact that the coronavirus situation is having on the mental health of people. I have also had my fair share of dealing with professionals like that, some people are just easier at masking their issues than others and it's the responsibility of the person assessing you to be able to determine this, the situation says more about the person assessing you than it does about you. I have felt deterred at times but if I had never given it another chance I would probably have died about a decade ago and never have discovered as much about myself or met the good ones along the way - it's worth persevering and making sure you've exhausted every avenue possible before considering that you mightve done all that can be done</TEXT>

    <TEXT>You're welcome! I can see what you're saying but there's also no way to be 'wrong' about how a mental health condition makes you present yourself - it just is what it is and although many may present themselves in a stereotypical way, it is still different for everyone to a degree. The tricky thing is that mental health assessments are a lot about individual perception and also since they are still human they can still potentially have their perception clouded by certain biases and stereotypes too which is all the more reason to persevere and see what another person's perception may be. It's totally up to you whether you want to make a complaint or not but the service is there to be used for that reason, in order to improve patient quality of treatment and to recitfy things that have clearly gone wrong so try not to feel like you're just being fussy as the service is designed to be used for these things. I know what you mean, for a long time I was in exactly the same spot (being too 'good' for one service and too 'bad' for another). It's tough for us all when the system isn't funded adequately in order to prioritise everyone who needs the support. I would imagine that it'd be unlikely you'd be seen by the same one but if you're concerned about that then do mention that when you speak to your GP or the relevant team before assessment  #128578;</TEXT>

I'm sure it'll be very helpful to know either way though. I would suggest to go back to your GP and tell them how you're feeling suicidal at times. Due to your age and seemingly not having issues that would meet the criteria for 'severe and enduring mental health illness' I dont think you'll be able to be referred to your local mental health team but they may have other services which they can refer you to - although you may have tried a lot of things already, sometimes it's different trying with the perspective of an adult rather than a teenage/youth perspective.</TEXT>

If you're 25 and older and you're not classed as having a 'severe and enduring mental illness' then you wont be referred there and it may be worth a one-off private assessment session with a psychiatrist if that's something you're able to afford</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Hey there, sorry to hear you're having to juggle your own mental health issues as well as the caring for your son, I think being a carer would be a tough enough job for even those who do it as a job but don't have that same 24/7 responsibility so huge respect for you! If your son is classed as having a learning disability, have you tried contacting [Mencap?](https://www.mencap.org.uk/advice-and-support/services-help-you). You could also try [Carers UK](https://www.carersuk.org/help-and-advice/talk-to-us) who can be contacted via phone or email. It may help to be able to offload to those who can truly understand/relate and may even have some decent advice specifically regarding the care having been cut. I think even just that support may help keep things manageable whilst your medication kicks in - if things start to become unmanageable please seek the advice in the automod comment</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Hey there, sorry to hear that you're feeling this way. A amp;E is for emergency situations meaning that there is an emergency that has occurred or is imminently about to occur which needs immediate attention. I don't doubt that you're feeling terrible but it's not good idea to plan to do something with the plan of then going straight to A amp;E when there are other options which are less risky. May I ask whether you have spoken to your GP about this yet? - your GP will be able to arrange help for you if you tell them what you've said here. Are you trying to avoid school for any particular reason, any bullying etc that is going on?</TEXT>

    <TEXT>It's quite significant amount of money, [here](https://www.cchr.org.uk/cost-detained-psychiatric-ward-treated/) is an article explaining the costs of one particular adult acute ward stay. May I ask why you feel an inpatient stay would be best for you? I think it's easy for people to have misconceptions of what an inpatient stay offers - even other medical professionals in the community who have not experienced it first-hand. Inpatient treatment is typically a short term emergency intervention for those who are a danger to themselves or others and have a mental health condition which requires treatment, which is the criteria for being admitted there. Typically there is not much help offered there and is primarily there to keep you/others safe until a suitable medication regime is established and can then be dealt with in the community. There are some places which offer some amount of therapeutic activity but it's far from a cure. There are some people there who may be constantly screaming for hours and even days, swearing, banging/smashing things, you may witness people being restrained which can be very traumatic, you may be hundreds of miles away from your family etc - they are some of the things you may be able to expect there</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Is that due to phone call anxiety or that you're not able to attend the GP surgery independently? - If it's because you're not able to attend the GP surgery independently then you may be in luck because they could potentially refer you based on a phone call assessment, with all that is going on currently. Unfortunately the mental health services are seriously underfunded and it can mean a lot of services don't function in the way that they should which is very frustrating, however, you will still be dealing with CAMHS services for a few more years even if you have any inpatient treatment. It's difficult especially after having had bad previous experiences but it's important to try and treat every interaction as a fresh one rather than a continuation of past ones - easier said than done though I know. I would suggest to post to [r/LegalAdviceUK](https://www.reddit.com/r/LegalAdviceUK/) for more information if you're concerned about what may go on your records or if you're concerned about your home treatment. Do you know what level of support would be best for you? Do you have an idea of what you feel hospital may offer you that's different to what you currently have access to? I probably would have said the exact same thing when I was 14 too but possibly with a lot more swear words haha - the work can be beneficial if you have an idea of what career path you want to choose. The good thing is that it's free - costs a fair bit of money to try and get those available qualifications when you're an adult if you didn't get them originally. Grades and 9-5 work isn't absolutely everything though, the main thing is having a passion/hobby as then you can potentially be your own boss some day  #128578;</TEXT>

I can't say my perspective has changed significantly after any such occasions but I do watch a lot of programmes such as 24 hours in A amp;E and it's quite common to hear that people now have a different/fresh perspective of life after being close to death. I have noticed that it can be quite easy to be consumed by the bad when something bad happens and to be consumed by the good when something good happens, rather than being able to look at it as a trajectory and that if one bad thing happens it doesn't mean everything is awful and vice versa for something good that happens</TEXT>

    <TEXT>They'll certainly have financial adjustments to make if redundant for a period of time but redundancy is something that any worker is at risk of but not everyone else gets the luxury of a huge payoff particularly within a company that is failing functionally at management level - it's unfortunate but hard to condone exceptional treatment when similar would often not be afforded to the average person being made redundant. [This](http://norfolksuffolkmentalhealthcrisis.org.uk/edp-revealed-the-six-figure-payouts-for-staff-leaving-the-norfolk-and-suffolk-mental-health-trust/) article from 2016 may shed more light onto why I've come to the conclusion that I have regarding the management side of things. It's very difficult to comment precisely on two specific people with no names given but there are clearly long-term and widespread management/staff concerns which would be difficult for any staff to avoid considering the scale of it. I said in my last comment that incompetence and moral bankruptcy seems to be rewarded in many high power/profile positions, I'm not sure if you may have misread/misinterpreted that but that is very different to declaring that all staff in these organisations are incompetent and morally bankrupt. There are many nice people working in these organisations I agree, I'm just pointing out that the likelihood of being rewarded for incompetent and morally bankrupt behaviour seems a lot higher with jobs associated with a high profile/power.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Hey there, something that has worked for me was to have a plan already laid out for the next day. Even just for things that are very basic, it helped me through depression and when quitting smoking due to all the spare free time. When you go to bed you could try making a plan for the next day e.g 9am - 9:30am shower, 9:30am - 10am breakfast, 10am - 11am podcast etc until your day is filled up. I found that it gave me purpose and direction but also be careful if you're someone who has obsessive compulsive tendencies like me or else it could make things more difficult if you end up getting too strict about it without realising. If you were trying to figure out specific things to do rather than simply what to do then perhaps taking free trials of things such as Netflix to see what might spark some interest/enthusiasm without too much initial commitment</TEXT>

The crisis team should be the ones able to deal with this, unless there has been severe harm requiring immediate medical attention or there is some wide-scale emergency.

I imagine that when your mum is in a better place mentally she may be able to appreciate your current efforts. I imagine it's really hard though when that realisation/appreciation won't always be apparent for a while and may even make you look/feel bad in the short-term. Has an assessment been booked or are they saying she can still have the choice as to whether she's assessed or not? If you're comfortable saying, what kind of symptoms is your mum dealing with?</TEXT>

    <TEXT>That's great to hear and I'm sure quite a relief for you both when it gets to that point - just try to keep thinking about all the times where she has been thankful to you when she is better and therefore being the 'bad guy' is actually a means to an end in achieving that positive outcome again. Have you tried explaining to her when/why they are coming around before they do actually come around? I'm not sure whether she will be in the right mindframe to have much of a meaningful conversation about it though. It does sound like inpatient treatment will be best for her so that she doesn't do anything that ends up putting herself or anyone else in a traumatic situation and so that her medication can be adjusted, including perhaps sleeping medication to get her sleep cycle more regulated which is bound to help a little bit towards mood regulation too</TEXT>

I think therapy-wise that is the most promising option and will offer the most hope for the future. In the mean time, have you tried calling any helplines specifically for OCD? I do have one included in the pinned masterpost at the top of the sub. It might help to be able to speak to someone who will be trained/familar with perhaps your more troubling symptoms and I guess it also helps knowing there's no long waiting list etc. Are you still 'on the books' of your local mental health team?

    <TEXT>Hey there, congrats on the news of you now being an expectant father! Though sorry to hear about your brothers cancer and the difficult situation with you and your wife's physical  amp; mental health. It is quite understandable for her mental health to be quite wacky during pregnancy, particularly as she has had a history with mental health issues and also a flare up regardless of pregnancy. I understand your concern about wanting two parents that are 100% committed and it's a sensible desire, though it's very hard to say whether her current emotions/actions are due to a decrease in commitment or whether it's temporary due to her mental health issues. Have you tried talking to her about perhaps reaching out to her GP? I think it's important to try and address this professionally as quickly as possible for all involved. It may help clear her mind and make it clearer how things could be after birth but also to make sure no damage comes to the health of her baby due to her not eating properly etc. I think you're doing a great job with things so far but there's only so much that you're able to do all by yourself</TEXT>

I'd say SAD is probably one big cause right now, particularly because the summer's are now hotter so I'm guessing there's more of a come down for those who function better in warmer weather or just generally prefer it. Personally I prefer the colder weather but even I'm feeling quite noticeably fatigued, it's hard when every day feels almost like a repeat of the last despite even a whole shift in season which I guess would normally feel like it brings more of a shift/change than what it has currently</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Hey there, thanks for sharing your story with the sub and sorry to hear about the way you're feeling currently as well as all that has happened up until this point including the death of your father. I hope that sharing your story has been able to help even just a little by being able to let all that emotion out, sounds like a lot of that has been building up over the years! Regarding your money situation, I'd suggest either to post to [r/LegalAdviceUK](https://www.reddit.com/r/LegalAdviceUK/) if you think it may be more of a legal case or to take a look at my recent resources post [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/MentalHealthUK/comments/j59a6k/in_view_of_current_economic_circumstances_here/). Do you have any career leisure interests/hobbies? Perhaps things you're interested in despite not feeling confident in your abilities such as with your guitar playing? Would you like to be able to socialise and meet more like-minded people? - I could be wrong but it sounds like maybe it's something you'd like but you currently don't have the opportunity to meet many other people(?) You do sound like a decent guy though! You've got a sense of humour, you sound caring, you keep trying despite facing adversities because you think about your cats first which is very admirable too. It sounds like you're someone who perhaps has a lot of unresolved trauma which is causing a lot of anger, resentment, shame, feeling a need for justice etc(?). You can tell me if I'm wrong, it just feels like I can relate to a lot of what you've written so I'm wondering if perhaps unresolved trauma is something you'd say is causing a lot of knock-on issues for you currently or am I a bit off-the-mark there? How long have you been on your new medication now? Are you feeling any different to when you were on Mirtazapine or when you first started this Sertraline/Promethazine combo?</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Hey there, congrats on getting the appointment! Seems strange to congrats someone on it haha but as you say, it can often be difficult to access! Have you tried writing down points to mention on a piece of paper or phone app? I've found that can be helpful for memory and also for feeling flustered and filling in any gaps etc. I understand what you mean by feeling a diagnosis may give you peace of mind but unless you're a straightforward case, you'll likely often come across different diagnoses or professionals that disagree with each other on it - I think it will be a long time before more definitive diagnoses can be given and that's if they haven't almost totally drifted from that route by then (it seems to me more common for them to want to address symptoms than to diagnose). I hope that things are becoming more manageable for you now and that you're able to access suitable treatment  #128578;</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Hey there, sorry to hear about the messy situation you've found yourself in and how it's making you feel. Often in these multi-issue situations it's quite hard to pinpoint which thing needs to be dropped/worked on etc but it seems to me the clear issue is uni right now. Had you tried searching for any courses outside of uni which you could pay for to perhaps become a personal trainer/fitnesd instructor etc and use that as a way of being closer to a gym setting and maybe as a gateway to doing BJJ full time? That may be difficult in the very immediate future but would it be a possibility for you? Maybe you could find a course local to your girlfriend or at least after completing a course you could move closer? Just a bit of food-for-thought as im not sure how possible this would be for you but it seems having to choose between sport and your girlfriend would make things worse for your mental health but that re-evaluating your academic situation seems the option which would be targeting what makes you unhappiest</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Hey everyone! To celebrate World Mental Health Day 2020 I am hosting a giveaway here **tomorrow (midnight tonight) lasting for 24hrs, for those in the UK.** I am hoping that in the process it will help raise some awareness, help to destigmatise, offer inspiration and hope - with the added bonus of supporting small business during this current difficult period. **All you will need to do is comment on the giveaway post I make with your story - this story can be brief or lengthy, it can be an overview of your life dealing with mental health issues, it can be just about a particular time of your life or about how things are for you currently but more importantly I would like it to include 1 goal/hope that you have for the future (no matter how big or small) and 1 activity/person/pet/organisation that actively helps or has helped your mental health** I will be entering in the usernames of everyone who participates and randomly generating 7 people using [this](https://app-sorteos.com/en/apps/pick-random-name-winner) site to win a  #163;15 Etsy gift card/voucher which will be sent to you via email. I will also make a post to this sub with the link that acts as a certificate to show the winners and prove the result. Please try not to feel disheartened if you do not win - everyone who contributes will potentially be helping someone else by sharing your story, goals and/or something that helps you. Sometimes even just a word, sentence or sense of relatability can be the start of someone's journey to seeking help or being inspired to make healthier changes in their life. **Tomorrow I will be creating the giveaway post titled 'World Mental Health Day 2020: what's your story?' and I will be accepting your comments/stories on there from when it is officially 10th October for 24hrs until it is officially 11th October when I will then randomly generate the winners and make a post sharing the link of the result, which will hopefully be later on the 11th October but may take a couple of days (depending on how many participate). I will be sending the Etsy gift card/voucher to your email address so be prepared to be able to let me know an email address for you if you win** Please only comment on other people's stories if offering support/encouragement etc. Any discriminatory or generally hateful comments will be removed. Big thank you to anyone who decides to participate!  #128578;</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Hey there! Sorry to hear it's becoming this problematic for you..I used to be addicted to energy drinks when I was a teen too - it got to the point of asking the shop owner to put aside a whole crate as it came in rather than just going to buy a few cans. Do you notice that you drink energy drinks during certain specific circumstances or that you do anything specific whilst drinking them? For example, I used to drink them and smoke at the same time and so the difficult but effective way was to tackle both at the same time or else it probably wouldn't have worked. I'm not speaking from experience here, hopefully someone else will be able to, but I'm assuming that your GP may think about referring you to a dietician/nutritionist unless you have mental health problems related to your energy drink addiction which would make you meet the criteria for a CAMHS assessment. Caffeine I don't think would be considered a drug addiction in terms of there being specific mental health treatment for it alone offered by CAMHS, I think it would be considered more alike nicotine addiction in that they'd rather deal with it through lifestyle change treatment/advice rather than mental health care specifically unless there are additional issues. I could be wrong there though as I never sought professional help for my addiction to them and it was also quite a few years ago too so things might have changed since then naturally in terms of how it's dealt with</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Hey there, sorry to hear about the tough upbringing that you had, it's really tough even when you get much older to be treated in a way that reaffirms the way you were treated/felt as a child, that kind of trauma can take a long time to heal and I'm glad to hear that things are more on track for you now. It's very admirable that you want to do more to help others, just always try to keep in-check with your own feelings too. I've never been a carer myself but I do know that it's said to be common to naturally dismiss your own emotions/needs as a carer (or someone who has been one) for a variety of reasons. What you're already doing is brilliant and will be making a huge difference! Perhaps you could make online petitions or create a blog? - if you wanted to do either of those then you're more than welcome to share them here  #128578;</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Hey there, thanks for all the great work you're doing! I imagine you must have many interesting/helpful stories to tell with all that experience. If you ever wanted to share any of the work you're doing then you're more than welcome to do so here. Regarding your question around us all having mental health but not all having mental health problems - I think it's akin to physical health in the sense that we can be predisposed to certain mental health conditons and also go through things in life voluntarily or otherwise which can cause the development of certain conditons, some to the degree which can really make it very difficult to recover from. I remember reading a comment on another sub recently from a healthcare professional where they were describing a patient they often see who has treatment resistant mental health issues and this healthcare professional likened their role to the equivalent of palliative care. I never have seen it phrased that way before but it does make sense to me. It's important not to write anyone off completely or to exclude them for their mental health issues, it is important to be compassionate and make them comfortable in whichever ways are possible but I feel it is also important to be realistic too. Although I think it is meant with good intentions - it can be disheartening for people to constantly say 'Look, this person only has 1 leg and can still achieve this' to someone who has a totally different condition which is treatment resistant and/or degenerative. For some people it will be much easier on their mental health to healthily accept their limitations and to work around them than to be compared to someone who has a visible physical condition or an unrelated mental health condition (in severity or nature) and having the constant pressure of feeling they should be in the same kind of position. What's one change you've noticed from when you started campaigning? Could be related to attitudes, stigma, legislation, etc anything that comes to mind!</TEXT>

    <TEXT>That's a good point - it feels quite simple really when you phrase it like that but sometimes the simple things are the easiest to overlook! I know what you mean when you say you feel it isn't productive, though delving a bit deeper, that in itself could at least potentially be indicative to others of certain conditions/symptoms and help us see some of the more hidden/underlying signs - it can be interesting to speculate and see whether something that seems negative/unproductive can in fact be helpful (even if not directly helpful). For example, could that person be someone with PTSD who is struggling with being able to talk about past abuse and so that is almost a 'passive-aggressive' approach to help them signify they are feeling troubled/desiring justice but can't express it? Could it be someone with BPD/EUPD who thinks they may be abandoned if they don't seem like they need support? Could it be someone who is depressed or who has a psychotic disorder and stuggles with ruminations/obsessive thoughts? I find psychology rather fascinating and agree with you there that everyone's experience even with the same symptom/condition is a very individual thing Yeah having it sort of broken down/visualised seems very useful particularly for those who find it more difficult to accept having a mental health issue/conditon. Sorry to hear about your lengthy experiences with those things, I hope you have managed to find support out there for those issues(?)</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I agree, I think we as a whole have finally grasped what we should do *generally* but that we as a whole are kind of stuck when it comes to actually specifically dealing with the issues when the bare reality is in front of us. For me it kind of feels like a broken promise on principle which is a shame but at least it means there is still a lot of room left for progress which will likely be filled up with more awareness and activism etc. Joe Tracini does some awesome frankly-spoken little clips on Twitter and to quote him in his vid from [yesterday](https://mobile.twitter.com/joetracini/status/1314493797162778625) 'talking about mental health problems is a bitch because you can't see them and it's scary because if you can't see something, then it can be denied' - I feel that quite aptly sums up the whole disparity between the attitude towards mental vs physical health, particularly for people who were among older generations, both in terms of sometimes our own views towards our own issues and others towards our issues. This post was me sharing a blog post from someone else rather than my own, however, I have also had experience with this too. I'm sorry to hear about your bad experiences both with your own mental health and how it was spoken about but I'm glad to hear that you did get the support you needed and hope that things are remaining manageable for you  #128578;</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Hey there, sorry to hear that you've not had the experience you've felt you needed with the NHS and that it's making it difficult to move forward. Have you tried googling 'private psychiatrist -insert your area here-'? It's not uncommon to be required to email or call up in order to be given a price for what the session will be. It can be potentially a few hundred pounds for a lengthy private session to try to come to a diagnostic conclusion but I'm sure it's quite variable depending on many factors. As far as I'm aware, If a particular medication is recommended then I don't think that the NHS will be under any particular obligation to provide you with the privately recommended medication at reduced cost but I would assume they'd rather go along with it than not in most cases. Your first step is to inquire with a local psychiatrist, then you may still need to see a GP to be referred to the private psychiatrist and then you will be contacted for appointment by them. It's a lot quicker and there's definitely some benefits there such as being perhaps more unbiased without having your notes, though this could also make things tricky in some ways too. If you think it is affordable and worth the short term pain for the long term gain (in a financial sense) then I'd say it's worth a try  #128578;</TEXT>

    <TEXT>You're welcome! There is the option for more sessions but I think at this point many will be aware that there are people out there who just want the assessment/clarity and to not be roped into paying consistent large amounts. They should be very clear when you contact them about what the full cost is and what you will be getting for that cost rather than you being left worried/wondering if there will be further charges. They will let you know either on their website or when you inquire as to whether you'll need to see your GP for the referral first - if that is the case then they will likely just be asking why you wish to go private but not anything too heavy. I understand it's easier said than done but you're certainly worth the same decent amount of care that I'm sure you'd suggest someone else would be. I hope it goes well and it's good that it seems youve got good support in/from your partner - if you have any further questions or issues or updates then you're always welcome to post again anytime  #128578;</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I know what you mean, it does make me wonder why it's a lot more accepted as a war related conditon...perhaps it's considered more verifiable/comprehensible when you can see that someone has medals or war injuries or it's confirmed in their notes etc, whereas with abuse it's often more invisible and seen as 'one word against another' etc. That's just me speculating though and not intended to detract from those who got their diagnosis from having experienced war. I think [this](http://assisttraumacare.org.uk/) site/organisation looks quite informative on the different causes/aspects and does offer therapy but just not for free - cant go wrong with an extra resource for those who would prefer/be able to afford quicker private treatment though</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I can understand why you'd feel that way, I'm sure there's many others who feel similarly regarding that specific issue/aspect too. I think that CPTSD is likely easier/more readily diagnosed in people who have been through those extremes and so it may skew perception when it comes to the diversity of issues that can cause CPTSD. I often make the point that it's not necessarily the diagnosis that's the most debilitating thing but more-so how it effects the person as there are people who have conditons that are deemed common/mild who have commit suicide and people with conditions that are deemed severe and yet they are quite socially functional or academically successful etc. I know that point doesn't take away from the natural feelings you have around that specific aspect but sometimes it can help ease things a bit to remind ourselves that even those with the same conditions can have vastly different experiences with it or causes of it</TEXT>

It's all about getting that balance as you say, because being selfless like that is a great thing but many great things can be/become unhealthy under certain conditons, it's probably quite natural for you though and so like with any habit it'll take time to work on but you do seem like you'll manage that balance quite nicely in time and with practice. Even doing as the support worker suggested and writing a memoir or a blog etc is in a way a form of self-care because you're spending time allowing yourself to process your own thoughts and emotions, I'd definitely suggest just starting off with a private one as you say and then see how you feel, nothing to lose eh? [Here](https://wordpress.com/go/how-to/private-blog-wordpress-com/) is a blog on WordPress about private blogs That sounds like a neat service! I think in the near future I'll have to create an area system here which adds services/resources by area as well as generally, there's some very good local services in some areas!</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Sorry to hear about your current situation with your grandparents. Even though your nan is a bit iffy with medications, how does she feel about speaking to someone on the phone about her issues, such as the Samaritans or another similar sort of helpline? If you're particularly concerned, you could call 111 (non emergency adviceline) and see what they suggest - it could be that they think she could benefit from being assessed under the Mental Health Act if she is at risk (through not eating properly) and doesn't have enough insight to deal with her issues in the community currently. I have a lot of resources amp;helplines on my sub [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/MentalHealthUK/comments/bc3jtm/mental_health_uk_master_post/) some of which may be useful if shes open to speaking to someone. There is also an AMHP on YouTube who discusses some cases he's dealt with including those involving elderly people, [here](https://m.youtube.com/watch?feature=youtu.be amp;v=NbIfWwYLXPo) is one example of his videos, hope this helps a little!</TEXT>

    <TEXT>If she isn't the type to want/ask for help but is at risk and without readily-available support then I'd definitely suggest to contact her GP or 111 (non emergency adviceline) to see what they suggest. It's better safe than sorry and although she may not be in a position to appreciate it currently/when things get bad, I'm sure she will when things are back better again. It's a bit of a postcode lottery but in certain areas there's more help/teams available which can act as a preventative measure to having to go into an inpatient unit</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Hey there, sorry to hear you're feeling depressed and not having a good experience with what's been offered to you so far. What kind of treatment do you feel would be best for you? Are you particularly for/against any types of treatment? I know how difficult it can be to try to treat each situation as a fresh one especially when having had previous negative experiences but it's important to try because there could be various reasons why it didn't work before such as the professional themselves, how you felt back then, the style of therapy etc. DBT is quite well rated but as with medications, there's some that seem to suit some people more than others. It's very good you've got access to DBT though, I would certainly give it a go before you move out of youth services which doesn't have as much of a strict criteria as adult services</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Hey there, sorry that you've had to deal with experiencing a death - if you'd like help with grief then I would suggest to try contacting [Cruse Bereavement](https://www.cruse.org.uk/). It does sound like you could benefit from some extra support though, it's definitely easier to deal with it now before it gets bottled up and the problems multiply, though I appreciate it's quite common for people to feel either they dont need or deserve extra support. It's worth a try, GPs are becoming increasingly aware and are even saying (through the media) that people should reach out if they feel they need it right now</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Sorry to hear you're feeling that way, do you like pets/have you considered a pet? (If you can afford one and are able to care for it). Pets can be brilliant for some unconditional love, or in some cases to get us out and about, giving us a reason to get up and feel we have purpose etc. I appreciate it's not something which everyone will be keen on or could physically/financially manage though. Sending good vibes your way!  #128578;</TEXT>

    <TEXT>You're welcome! There are some mental health conditions which can cause that kind of fluidity or instability in moods/emotions though, so you may find that there's an underlying cause which could be addressed. No need to feel guilty about getting support you need, though I appreciate that's sometimes easier said than done!</TEXT>

There may be ways to get longer term and more intensive support without taking any risky action - it's hard to say what may happen when you take alcohol alongside medication because that raises potency unpredictably They may send an ambulance and also entry will be forced into your house if they feel you have done something which endangers your life and you aren't able to open the door</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I understand that feeling of difficulty, though often it's actually more difficult to keep struggling on when there are still options left to exhaust which could potentially provide quick support/relief - if you've been advised to do that by your GP then at least you can justify it to yourself (not that it should need justifying, but that can be a consolatory factor for those who feel they need to justify it to themselves). Be as open and honest as you can manage and see what happens, more to gain than to lose eh?  #128578;</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Hey there, sorry to hear about your long term experience with self harm and struggling to trust anyone. I imagine it was probably even difficult to share this post with us so thanks for doing that! Have you thought about what treatment you may be open to? - medication, groups to meet similar people, therapy? It's a bit of a postcode lottery in terms of funding for therapy so I'm not entirely sure if you'll be able to get that - is private therapy an option for you if you're open to the idea of therapy? You wouldn't be wasting anyone's time, they're meant to be there to try to support you if you need it. You'll never know until you try speaking with your GP to see what's freely available, what's to lose eh?</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I think you're right in that many people with severe mental illness probably wouldn't be in the position to take up this offer (though I have known many people with psychotic disorders who enjoy being out in nature) and that there'll also be many who have milder issues/more functional who will be quite busy, though I do think it's a good to have as an option for people. Many elderly people may benefit, many people with learning disabilities and people in the category of not having severe enough issues for intensive support but still needing some form of extra options to try. There should still be more funding for mental health care in general though. I think most of us have sussed that the money is there, it's just a matter of governments not prioritising mental health care</TEXT>

    <TEXT>If you feel she may need some support herself in order to cope with how she must be feeling from being very busy and tired, maybe it could be worth politely suggesting or asking if she'd like to get some support - as horrible as it must be, perhaps she just doesn't have any extra energy left to spend when it comes to intimacy. I'd definitely recommend seeing which one may be most applicable to you and giving it a try - friends and family can potentially be supportive but I guess there's only so much they can do when perhaps it's either not easy to be totally honest with them or that they may not know how to deal with it. Sometimes it's good to get an unbiased/outsider perspective too. I hope that getting this off your chest has been helpful in some way for you  #128578;</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I am not much of a technology guru so I won't attempt to comment on what is happening on your computer - have you tried asking around on certain tech related subreddits so that you can perhaps put your mind at ease? There is always the potential chance that someone we know can see what we are publicly posting online, such as these comments here. It's very unlikely that they would connect that to you though. Why don't you try it for yourself - have a look through some comments here and see even with all that information if you can guess who the people are or what else they are up to...if you find it difficult to do that then they would likely find it equally difficult to do to you, right? You're right though, it's a very stressful time for many people and stress can wreak havoc on the mind. Do you have anyone you can talk to about the stress and other situations you're dealing with?</TEXT>

    <TEXT>It's good that you're managing to mostly ignore those feelings/suspicions for now. Are you registered with a GP/doctor surgery? If you are then I would suggest to contact them and to speak honestly as possible about how your situation is making you feel, then you may be able to see a community mental health team before your suspicions become too overwhelming. While you're waiting though it's good to see what quick 24 hour listening services there are which I have included in those links  #128578;</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I would recommend to try contacting somewhere like Citizens Advice or StepChange Debt Charity for your financial concerns right now and to contact one of the helplines in the list/post I sent for someone to talk to. There may be a local 'walk-in centre' that you can attend without being registered if you felt desperate to see someone. If you ever feel like you may do something dangerous then you could call 111 (non emergency adviceline - they could potentially advise what service is best for you) or if you feel you are immediately about to do something dangerous or have done something dangerous then make sure to call 999 or try to get someone to take you A amp;E</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Hey there, sorry to hear about your recent experiences and how they're making you feel. It's quite understandable that you'd feel the way that you do after hearing that comment. With regards to your mother's comment, did you make sure to explain/clarify that you didn't mean you didn't intend it as you not planning to work for the rest of your adult life? Did you feel able to tell her how her comment made you feel? Without knowing your mother and your relationship with her, it's hard to say whether that would be beneficial advice though. What I think would be best is for you to contact your GP and to be honest about your self harm and what you invision your mental health situation will be like in the very near future. If you feel like you will do something dangerous imminently then do not hestitate to contact 999 or to try and get yourself to A amp;E if possible. I think that there's only so much that can be done by reaching out to friends and family, and that your needs likely require support beyond what they are able to provide</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Here are some statistics from within the article for easier/quicker access:  gt; In June 2019, the mental health charity Mind, described the disparities in mental health in its legal newsletter, saying: "Different communities have different experiences of mental health and of treatment.  gt; "At the age of 11 there a very few differences, but by adulthood the picture is different. Black men and white men experience similar rates of common mental health problems but but black women experience substantially higher rates of them than white women.  gt; "When it comes to psychosis black men experience around 10 times more frequently than white men.  gt; "But despite Black people, in very, very broad brush terms, having worse experience of mental health than white people, the latter are more than twice as likely to be receiving treatment for mental health problems.  gt; "If one examines routes to treatment you will see that Black people are 40% more likely to access treatment through a police or criminal justice route, less likely to receive psychological therapies, more likely to be compulsorily admitted for treatment, more likely to be on a medium or high secure ward and be more likely to be subject to seclusion or restraint (56.2 per 100,000 population for Black Caribbean as against 16.2 per 100,000 population for white).  gt; "We must stress that there is a hugely complex picture here, but it seems undeniable that Black people get to the sharper end of treatment in the more uncomfortable ways."  gt; It went on to describe a perception in the black community of the system as inhumane, adding: "Research on clinical decision-making suggests that clinicians hold negative implicit attitudes toward people from minority backgrounds - and that there is a direct link between these attitudes and clinicians' treatment decisions."</TEXT>

    <TEXT>It's probably easier said than done but perhaps it might be a better idea to try to completely diffuse the situation before it gets that bad, such as politely saying that you'd rather not talk about it, walking into another room if appropriate or ignoring any of those comments and change the subject each time it happens. It might be helpful for you to look at the "Circles of control, influence and concern" which you can find [here](http://www.clairenewton.co.za/my-articles/circles-of-control.html) but also on other sites too. It basically aims to teach you/support you in the idea that "If you cannot control it, do not get stressed about it. If you cannot influence it, do not get upset about it. Focus on what you can change, not on what you cannot" Does your GP know that you are self harming? If they know this then they should be considering further options. If you feel your situation requires seeing your local mental health service or to be assessed and you're not having your self harm recognised, it may be worth trying a different GP for a second opinion</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Do you have any earphones on you? It may be an idea to just listen to your music if she persists when you've already asked politely, it's also understandable that you may prefer not to do that though. A diagnosis may help in potentially being able to unlock certain support for your mum but if she doesn't feel she needs support then the process of getting a diagnosis would probably cause more hassle than it would to solve anything, unfortunately there is not a lot that can be done about that and so it's worth thinking about the things/factors you are able to control instead so that you don't overwhelm yourself too much, again, I appreciate its easier said than done though. It's very frustrating that it is such a "postcode lottery" when it comes to mental health care. I hope that since you've been waiting so long that it isn't too much longer until you're finally assessed, and hopefully you'll feel a sense of clarity or relief after that. In the mean time, if you are at the point where you are imminently about to do something dangerous, please do call 999 or try to get to A amp;E as you will then be able to be assessed too.</TEXT>

I have been in a few hospitals and never realised they still did dorms, I assumed it already was a thing of the past! For me personally I need my own space, where I can abide by my own hygiene and feel safer. Being around other people like that would drive me nuts, I think there's ways which could help reach more of a happy medium though</TEXT>

    <TEXT>The criteria to for the adult community mental health team here is to have a 'severe and enduring mental illness' - this can *potentially* be depression or personality disorder which causes suicidal actions but is most often limited to bipolar and schizophrenia in practice. My experience with adult mental health hospitals has been very different to that of an adolescent one - it wasn't horrendous but I'm sure there are some that are more renowned for being that way. Have you tried searching in google '-insert area here- adult mental health team criteria'? You may be able to find it through there and much more information too about the way they function.</TEXT>

You can see more about that [here](https://www.nhs.uk/common-health-questions/nhs-services-and-treatments/what-is-pals-patient-advice-and-liaison-service/) Your desire to want to change things by making a report is admirable, particularly when you're clearly struggling yourself. Unfortunately it probably won't be as effective without you having a legal foothold - it would be great for you to stick around and get involved in some activism and for you to be able to see the changes you've pushed for being implemented - though I appreciate that you may not feel in the position to consider anything like that currently</TEXT>

    <TEXT>It sounds like a very risky thing, how it could easily exacerbate paranoia and also lead to violence and/or sexual abuse. Plus as you say, the knock-on effect when everyone is at different stages of recovery etc. I also found on a mixed sex ward that it was kind of an eerie atmosphere, I could be wrong and it could've just been that way anyway but I dont think either the men or women felt particularly comfortable being themselves there. I also see what you're saying by single rooms making it easier/more likely for people to stick to their rooms. It's a tough balance because everyone's coping mechanisms are very different and so a 'black or white' approach will always leave some people dissatisfied. At least for meal times there is the chance to be social but perhaps if more units were funded in order to run more activies then it'd entice some people out more, though there'll always be people who just feel more comfortable being isolated and is the 'lesser of two evils' for them. I really hope in future throughout mental health care in general that there is a focus on flexibility rather than the rigidity approach which seems to be failing so many people. I also hope you're doing/feeling a bit better nowadays  #128578;</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Hey there, I'm no longer adolescent but I did have some experience there. I would say that now that I'm older, I can view it as something important which shaped me and was an experience to learn from. I don't think that it was necessarily the best method of treatment for me though, at least not for as long as I was there. I think it can potentially be quite beneficial for those which offer activities/therapies and have certain rules, even the good ones come with their issues though if you're there long enough - particularly becoming institutionalised There were good experiences and bad experiences, it was still quite traumatic in ways that weren't necessarily obvious at the time, for me it was kind of a trauma that creeps up on you and needs digesting properly. There were however experiences that did help at the time, such as a few days out which I wouldn't have otherwise experienced due to not being social. There was the chance to form bonds with like-minded people, a lot of camaraderie but also there was a bit of drama too as you can imagine when you lock a bunch of teens together.</TEXT>
