    <TEXT>My dad is in Aortic valve replacement and root surgery at the moment. They made their first incision at about 10:30, it is now 2:20 and they said the valve and graft are installed and they are just warming up the body and heart. After that they will take him off the heart lung machine and start beating his heart. Then closure. How long?!</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I am sorry I put this in AskReddit. I didn't know what subreddit to ask this in so I figured I'd just throw it in here. Anyways, I have an Acer Aspire X3950 and the tower is very small... I had to unscrew some of the casing off my video card just to get it in there (did not take out anything important) Here is a picture with the same size of my tower (shows how small it is): http://www.villman.com/product_photos/acer-x3950.gif (gif? idk why) Basically its half the height of a regular tower and half the width also. It's length is normal. Is there any way I can very safely move all of these parts into a bigger tower so that I can upgrade it? I am pretty sure the motherboard is regular sized. EDIT: I am done looking at this post cuz my question has been answered :D thanks</TEXT>

    <DATE>2012-11-02 17:42:28</DATE>
    <TEXT>I have an acer ax3950 (small case...) and I want to buy some stuff during black friday to increase its speed. I want to buy an SSD for sure but I am not really sure if there is an extra hard drive cord in there which I can plug the SSD in. I also have only 4gb of ram and I am going ot buy 12 more gigs but is it really worth it? how would 4gb to 12gb of ram be different? I am also wondering if anyone knows of any video cards that would fit in my case.. whcih is only about 6 inches wide... So i need a video card thats pretty small. Currenly im using Radon HD 5450 the smallest one, I had to unscrew the bracket thing where u plug your monitor into the computer for it to fit. I can put in pics later but I am at school right now. (also sorry about the spelling errors I am kind of rushing) I am also wondering if I can change the processor in my computer to a better one without screwing anything up. Thanks!</TEXT>

    <TITLE>Bought a CSGO server last night</TITLE>
    <DATE>2012-12-30 20:56:20</DATE>
    <TEXT>Last night I bought a CSGO server because I had a lifetime 50% off of the monthly fee... I just added all the highest settings (Payed an extra 20 bucks for all of them) Such as 128 tick..."ultra accel"...high CPU I would appreciate it if people played in it just so I can say I am putting it to use rather than have it sitting around like many other gameservers. 66.225.195.204:27015 -- Chicago, IL (US Central) If you guys have any feedback/suggestions just reply here. There are so many differences compared to running a 1.6 server which I could still use help on. OH and we could use some more admins... assuming people will actually play here. edit: Thanks for all the support everyone! Server was pretty packed earlier and I am happy that you all came to play :) Took everyones advice too</TEXT>

    <TITLE>[Troubleshooting] Xonar DG sound card reverb/echo</TITLE>
    <DATE>2013-03-07 02:52:09</DATE>
    <TEXT>I built my computer about a month ago and I added a Xonar DG sound card. It is now reverbing/echoing all of a sudden an hour ago after I alt tabbed out of CSGO. Anyone know how to fix it? i tried restarting/disabling computer, etc... if the volume is really low i cant really hear the problem though. But once I raise it the reverb starts and then once i raise it to a certain level all the bars on the equalizer thing shoot up (30, 60, 120....16k) and it creates a loud scary noise. EDIT: FIGURED IT OUT! STEREO MIX ENABLED SOMEHOW!!! anyone know whats up??</TEXT>

    <TITLE>[Troubleshooting] Computer keeps freezing!</TITLE>
    <DATE>2013-03-11 01:15:56</DATE>
    <TEXT>Recently I have been downloading and burning a bunch of 700mb linux versions. Just 5 hours ago my computer begun its freezing and does so like 5-10 minutes after i restart it. If I don't restart it, it restarts by itself. When it turns back on, it just stays at this Black Screen (much like how the bootloader screen looks) although there is just one ' | ' blinking cursor thing on the 3rd or 4th line down. Could this perhaps be an issue with my hard drive(s)? 64gb SSD (as my OS drive) 1TB HDD Other specs: i5-3570k Gigabyte Z77x-UD3H G.Skill Ares 8gb 1866mhz Please help me r/buildapc!</TEXT>
