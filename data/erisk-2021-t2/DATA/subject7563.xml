    <TEXT>Mine is pretty superficial and disappointing, hopefully you guys can do much better. When I was around 12 or so I really wanted a beard, I realised that in order to get one I needed to start shaving. I asked my dad to teach me but he told me I was too young and it was unnecessary. I decided to go up to the bathroom and do it myself, ended up shaving way more than needed, as in right up under my eyes. I didn't really think much of it at the time. I now have a light bumfluff on my upper cheeks a few years later. It's really annoying. If I ever say anything about it to my dad he just laughs and days he told me so.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Coming down after yesterday's win has me thinking about the Champion's Cup Quarters in 2 weeks. A Leinster team that we could see play vs. Saracens in 2 weeks time could look like: *a* " * " *denotes a player who featured in Ireland's 6 Nations* 1. Cian Healy* 2. Sean Cronin* 3. Tadhg Furlong* 4. Devin Toner* 5. Scott Fardy 6. Jordi Murphy* 7. Dan Leavy* 8. Jack Conan* 9. Luke McGrath (if fit) (*McGrath was on the bench vs. France but didn't get on*) 10. Johnny Sexton* 11. James Lowe 12. Isa Nacewa 13. Garry Ringrose* 14. Fergus McFadden* / Barry Daly / Adam Byrne 15. Rob Kearney* 16. James Tracy 17. Jack McGrath* 18. Andrew Porter* 19. James Ryan* 20. Max Deegan 21. Nick McCarthy 22. Ross Byrne / Joey Carbery* 23. Jordan Larmour* Leinster are absolutely spoiled for talent. It's insane. This is with injuries to players like Robbie Henshaw, Sean O'Brien, Josh Van der Flier and Rhys Ruddock.</TEXT>

    <TITLE>My first build and ready to splash out, am I spending any money needlessly?</TITLE>
    <DATE>2018-06-26 20:31:28</DATE>
    <TEXT>###Build Help/Ready: **Have you read the sidebar and [rules](http://www.reddit.com/r/buildapc/wiki/rules)? (Please do)** Yes! **What is your intended use for this build? The more details the better.** Mainly gaming. **If gaming, what kind of performance are you looking for? (Screen resolution, framerate, game settings)** Looking for high framerate and game settings. I just don't want to have to worry about frames, been playing on a laptop for the last few years and I'm very limited in what I can play.

    <TITLE>A few issues I've found playing over the weekend.</TITLE>
    <DATE>2018-12-09 14:09:00</DATE>
    <TEXT>I really enjoyed playing Insurgency so I was excited to get in for the free weekend, but there's a few issues I have found while playing so I'd like to see what other people think. Not really going to go into the texture pop ins and weapons not spawning stuff as I've already seen that mentioned a bunch. 1. Run back times are too long, my team lost A early on Crossing (I think that's what it's called) and spawned ~150m behind B, leading to losing B that same wave as the attackers were in there before we could enter. This goes the same way for attackers, as the run from spawn to the approach of A site on the industrial map takes what feels like ages. 2. Defenders can get really punished on their run back aka spawn camping. In the same example from above, there's a lot of open space between defender B spawn and B site, an attacker was waiting to the right of the house and just lit us up, leading to the rest of my team idling around the rocks instead of playing obj. This is also an issue on B on the industrial map as most defenders will run along the catwalk and I was able to just mow them down with my pkm. 3. I can't imagine this is a permanent decision but at least for this weekend there's no call vote option. I've had trolls and afkers a few times in my matches and there's nothing that can be done about them. 4. This might just be me but I feel like the aim down the sights animation on pistols seems quite slow. I may be completely wrong but I felt it was much faster in the first Insurgency. 5. Not really a fan of the vault animation. I keep getting caught on edges and it's quite annoying. I've fell to my death a couple of times trying to jump from on catwalk to another. This is all I can really think of right now but I'm enjoying the game all the same. The visuals are fantastic and the guns feel very satisfying. Cheers</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I was reviving my teammate on the supply ship after we dropped on it. As I was reviving him I saw that our bodies were not sitting still on the ship when we were in the animation. We were sliding across the deck at about the same speed the ship was travelling at. We came out of the animation as we slid through a crate where we both died. My banner was recovered but my teammate's crate vanished. Posting this here as I don't see a bug report thread anywhere.</TEXT>

On the other hand, USA chants for winning against a troll draft while your team is representing a region and not just the United States is annoying. Also chanting it while having 3 imports and Xmithie not even being from NA is just stupid imo.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Irish people do not pronounce *th* as *ff*. That's very much an English thing. I'll speak for some of Dublin where some words beginning with "Th" are pronounced as "D". Like *The car* would be said as *De Car*. Same goes for Then, There. For words like *"Through"* or *"Thorough"* (first ones that come to mind) you basically get rid of the h after the t. There are so many accents in Ireland though that this could change by driving 20 minutes in any direction.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>The dude was a co-owner of a csgo gambling site a few years ago and didn't disclose it while advertising the site to his viewers. He'd make big bets and win crazy amounts of skins. So it didn't matter how much he bet cause it was all going back into his pocket and that doesn't even include the probability that it was rigged in his favour. When it was all revealed he just kept quiet while Tmartn and Syndicate took all the heat which meant he got out relatively unscathed. Dude's whole personality is this stoner who's all about "good vibes". It's all an act, he's fake as fuck.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Best's lineouts were back to being poor. Stander was anonymous all game. Murray looked lethargic again and still won't join a ruck to save the ball. I don't know what the fuck Carbery was doing when he came on, every single pass went to the next man, no imagination. Wouldn't say it's in poor taste at all. Gardner was atrocious in the second half for us. Japan played well but they were living offside during our time in their 22 in the 60+minutes or so. Constantly through the side all game to slow down our rucks and the whistle stayed quiet so why wouldn't they keep doing it? Fair play to Japan, would have loved to see them do this to any team but us but that's how it goes I guess. Incredible for the sport over there if they get into the quarter finals.</TEXT>

    <TEXT> gt; They can easily take a game off of a good chunk of the group stage teams You know they're (almost, barring upsets) guaranteed group C right? Like that's SKT, RNG and FNC. 3 of the best teams in the entire tournament. Man for man they're undoubtedly worse in every position except for top as I reckon Huni can compete with Khan, Bwipo and Langx. I see them going 0-6 with their predictable herald plays and the ridiculous jungle, mid and support difference. Cody Sun has been playing well but he's going up against Teddy, Uzi and Rekkles who are on an entire other level.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>According to MarkZ it's because everytime they used to do the graphic, it would become a focal point where there would be a lot of hate so this year it's on the casters/analysts themselves to announce if they are going or not. I know LEC made a graphic but that's probably because every member of the LEC was going.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>You're right the format is awful. Riot values storylines of hard and easy groups ahead of competitiveness. RNG i agree with definitely, TL didn't show much at all aside from the first Damwon game and C9 were legitimate dogshit. Splyce beat FPX and LMS first seed to get to where they are which I'd value over C9's two shaky wins over HKA and TL's weak performances against AHQ. Their Damwon game was good though and it's a shame they couldn't reproduce it.</TEXT>

    <TEXT> gt; Notice how these threads about regions use of imports never mention LPL's reliance on imports because that topic cant be turned into a region bash about being superior to one another. Or because LPL's English stream has 3k viewers on average which would mean 1 viewer for every thousand odd subscribers here, and that's implying that all 3k even use this subreddit. Maybe it's because people are ignorant to the LPL and have no opinions on it? Meanwhile this subreddit is majority NA and EU so the discussions of importing relative to the two regions are relevant. I could start a thread discussing LPL's use of imports right now and it *might* get 60 upvotes and 30 comments. People will talk about what they want to talk about.</TEXT>

    <TEXT> gt;They were lucky TL beat IG and TL laid an egg in finals. Such a fucking stupid take. You're literally relying on IG's performance in Bo1s and thinking that it would translate 1:1 to a bo5 setting. If TL could humiliate IG then G2 had every chance of doing the same. You can luck out in a best of 1. What TL did to IG had nothing to do with luck.  gt; They literally got 2-0d by TL a month or two later and TL isnt even good Where in your argument do you mention that this was in a fucking meme tournament in rift rivals where one of the games they played Shyv top, Eve jng and Zed/Yuumi bot? The lengths G2 haters go to undermine their year. Such a reach. What's next? No G2 member won the 1v1 at all stars?</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Unfortunately you can't compliment anything on this sub without people rushing to tell you why they think your opinion is shit. I don't get why everything needs to be a competition to some people between the LCS and LEC. It's got nothing to do with inter-regional team trash talk which can be fun. It's super boring now reading; "I like the LEC/LCS casters." "I think they're shit and I'm gonna tell you why." Like fuck off and let people enjoy things jesus christ. LEC appreciation threads only become anti-NA because NA fans come in telling Europeans that they're wrong or EU fans that have a hate boner for anything NA that can't keep it to themselves have to let it out.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I think it was found to be natural causes but the timing made it seem dodgy as fuck. It was the 2007 cricket world cup and at the time cricket was super niche here in Ireland (still kind of is). I don't know a great example but Ireland's victory might have been the equivalent of an NA academy team beating 2016 SKT in a bo5. It was so unprecedented you can understand why it might have had an affect on the manager's health.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>England's line speed has been immense but so what? You don't have to try to play it out to the backs every phase. We have incredible ball carriers like Stander, Ryan and Furlong so just give them the fucking ball. Up the jumper stuff. If they're stuck in the bottom of a ruck then give a first man crash ball every phase with lads like Aki and Henshaw. Their line speed means fuck all if you don't play into their hands. Ireland's lack of ability to think on the fly and adapt to the game is killing us. I don't trust Sexton to lead from behind as I would BOD, POC or Best. He's having a shit game so he's likely to go into a huff.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Pretty well documented at this stage that Fnatic's issues last year were predominately communication based. Players letting grievances with each other grow over weeks instead of nipping them in the bud immediately. It's not a reflection of the LEC as a whole. Apparently things are a lot better for Fnatic this season. Travis' lack of knowledge when it comes to Europe shows itself again and he still refuses to do any research when it comes to interviewing LEC players.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Same reason they have the whole "LCS stocks" segments, it's filler. I've actually been watching a lot of LCS this split and the biggest thing that sticks out to me is how poor the countdown preshow is. The game show on Saturday was great fun but it was completely at the expense of actually hyping up the matches that day. Who actually gives a fuck about the stocks? The LCS on-air team and that's it. No one is following it at home and keeping track of values, it's just pure filler. If the same thing was done on the LEC broadcast there'd be people foaming at the mouth complaining that the casters and analysts are trying to make the whole show about themselves. Azael's Ornn combo tutorial last week was pretty good, they could do more of that for other champs too.</TEXT>

That's less than every major LoL league. Viewership would have to triple to match any of them. https://escharts.com/tournaments/lol/lec-spring-2020 https://escharts.com/tournaments/lol/lcs-2020-spring https://escharts.com/tournaments/lol/lck-spring-2020 It's also less than both the Brazilian and Vietnamese leagues. https://escharts.com/tournaments/lol/cblol-summer-2020 https://escharts.com/tournaments/lol/vcs-summer-2019 Obviously LoL is the biggest esport in the world but those numbers don't even bring it to top 3 esports in the West.

    <TEXT>Britain is the large island with England, Scotland and Wales. Ireland is the island with Northern Ireland (UK) and the Republic of Ireland.  gt;but it IS part of the British Isles The fact that is confuses you is exactly why we Irish hate the term. We don't recognise that term in the Republic and neither would nationalists in Northern Ireland(a majority of the country). We are not British and we don't appreciate that some people call our island as if it is owned by Brits. It is a term that came from colonisation and unfortunately it has lingered. inb4 some gammon replies telling me that it's "just a geographical term m8". Here's a great comment from an /r/MapPorn thread a while back.  gt;Just on the British Isles naming debate.  gt;I think most people don't get why we don't like it because they don't see where we're coming from.  gt;Over the course of 8 centuries Irish culture was the victim of cultural genocide and ethnic cleansing at the hands of the British. That's not a theory, it is a historical fact. If you dispute this I'll reply in detail in a separate comment.  gt;Many aspects of our culture were erased or very nearly erased. This has manifested in a sense of inheretted cultural trauma. We're very protective of our culture as a result. I think you'd have to be cold hearted not to appreciate that.  gt;So when people use an imperial term that was a tool in that cultural genocide, we get upset. We also get upset because this term confuses many people into thinking that we are British. To us, that's proof that this term is doing the job it intended, undermining our culture.  gt;So as you can see, we feel very strongly about the term.  gt;My question to you is why do you care about it? What makes it so important to you that you refuse to have a little compassion. Why is the minor inconvenience caused by using a different name more important than respecting the wishes of millions of people who find this term insulting? Sorry for the long reply.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>https://twitter.com/Xenogenic/status/1242910269266784256 This gets announced the day before a new pass on a rioter's account with less than 10k followers. I didn't see this until now in this thread and after I bought the RP to get the pass. What's wrong with people who buy the pass getting the prestige skin? The barrier to entry for the event skins are already 1650 RP and a bunch of grinding. Why would they want to make this feel worse to grind for? Do you reckon it's because of the free time due to the quarantines? I was going to be playing a bunch of league anyway so it's whatever to me but there needs to be a lot more clarity on these decisions. What a dumb change.</TEXT>

LS dislikes Veteran and as a result so do many in his fan base. LS does get a lot of hate but I swear your "messiah" comment could be said for the LS fans too. Any critique of him and there's pitchforks.  gt;Being critical of the statement that Veteran is the "most" knowledgeable guy in the EU scene isn't really hate. Agreed but if someone's gonna make that statement but provide no examples of people more knowledgeable than it comes across as unconstructive hate or contrarianism at the least.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I'm the opposite. I really dislike it when casters turn the dial to 11 for every little thing that happens in a match. Like the first blood in a CLG vs. FQ match should never carry the same energy as a world final team fight over an objective. It's prevalent in a lot of casting across the world. The whole "rap god" energy. The way I see it is that if everything is hype then the big moments that truly matter get diluted down. I completely see the viewpoint of making the game more interesting and for it not to be seen as a waste of time but sometimes you have to call a spade a spade. Some matches just don't mean as much.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>(New User) I've set up my tsm using both the BilisOnyxia guide and the Xionik video so everything seems good to go, the only problem is i'm sitting here for 10 mins without a single item popping up on my sniper. I'm on EU-Draenor, the biggest server and it just seems off to me. Is this normal?</TEXT>

    <TEXT>It's only used "basically everywhere" due to British imperialism. Just because they're widely used does not mean that it is an accurate description of the islands. I don't see any bullying on here? People trying to educate others on how the Irish feel on the matter isn't bullying. Only time it gets heated is when someone comes in being obtuse and tries to tell others what their country is. What I fail to understand is why it matters so much that it keeps being called the "British Isles". Language and its use changes all the time and this will be another instance of that. Just accept that it's not the correct term anymore and let's all move on.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I couldn't believe what I was watching last week in Leinster vs Munster when it was still constant fucking box kicks back and forth. I'm all for a kick over the top into space behind a retreating defence, but these bullshit box kicks from your own 10 metre line that maybe make 15 metres and deliver possession to your opponent makes me want to pull my hair out. I feel like rugby is due a revolutionary mind to come to the scene and change everything. Unoptimised is the perfect word to describe it.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Yeah you make a fair point about familiarity in the LEC. Munch, Dagda and Penguin came from EU Masters though so they would be quite familiar with the LEC crew.  gt;I can't be the only one who thinks these demands about using LPL casters are completely unrealistic. I think it's a good thing that the community is voicing their opinion on it, whether or not it was possible for anything to change in such a small amount of time. This collection of LPL casters are still building their brands so they wouldn't have as many supporters that could go out to bat for them like this.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>That was 5 years ago dude, I don't see how that's relevant to today. It's possible to develop and grow a lot in the space of 5 years. For example, Deficio was shat on as a caster when he started in 2014 and look how he ended up. Since the Worlds you mentioned he got two rookie EU teams to Worlds 2016 and 2018 and then became the first Western coach in the LCK. Pretty hard to get carried by your charisma when you can't even speak the language. Maybe you just don't like the dude?</TEXT>

You're deluding yourself into thinking it's 2019 again and people think G2 and Fnatic will win Worlds or something.

    <TEXT> gt; And yes my viewpoint that Qatar/China/Russia is worse than the US is objectively true, as that is what objective means as objective is not swayed by external factors like subjectivity is. Do you ever think that there may be "external factors" to why you hold that viewpoint? Where you were born, your upbringing, your education, the media you consume etc. etc.?  gt;And there you go with the US-hate boner just like I said. People always do it when their argument is debunked and they have nothing else to say. Have a good day, there is no reason to talk to you anymore with you clearly showing what you think. Criticism doesn't necessarily equal hatred. What debunking? You tried to tell me that as an American you're impartial when viewing American foreign policy yet someone from a country subjected to American imperialism is biased against the USA. Why do you feel like they would have a dislike for the USA? You're the one that seems to have nothing left to say. Good day to you too.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>The addition of two 4th seeds has done wonders to viewership and all around play-in interest this year. The reason play-ins is more competitive is because no longer are there 3rd seeds stomping the minor regions. I hope they keep this format in the future for when the VCS returns. I think Worlds gets more hype the more games we see and the more different matchups we get.</TEXT>

    <TEXT> gt; Perkz showed some vitality, but he's nowhere near last year's form. Maybe it's the meta, but he doesn't seem too solid on popular picks rn. Perkz could have ran it down every game for all I care and I wouldn't have given him a hard time. After what he's gone through in the Summer split I can only commend him for picking himself back up and going on to win Summer. Yeah the meta might not favour him right now but I'll always have faith that he'll hold his own at least.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Yeah things aren't as dire as they appear with Fnatic. Mids don't seem to be able to flex their muscles this meta, there's not really been any stand out performances between Chovy, Knight, Caps or Showmaker. Knight hasn't played like the #1 player he was touted to be which nullifies their big advantage in the mid lane. If Nemesis can keep his current form then I don't see him getting hard gapped.</TEXT>
