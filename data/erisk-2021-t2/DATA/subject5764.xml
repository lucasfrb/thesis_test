    <TITLE>Multiplayer Player count</TITLE>
    <DATE>2019-08-01 12:33:28</DATE>
    <TEXT>I really want to get a Rift soon but what i'm worried about, is the player count in games like Onward for example. Steamcharts shows me that there are only \~30 players right now. Are there more players that are not shown because of the rift store? Or can i expect no more players as soon as i get it? Also is there a way to see the amount of players via rift store somewhere?</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Does anybody know if it is possible to turn off the Hostile monsters in NMS? I really want to play this game in VR once it's available but especially the biological horrors freak the s**t out of me even in non vr. I really think that these might destroy my VR experience for this game which would be sad since I'm really looking forward to explore the worlds in VR</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Had that in subnautica. When i started and didn't know that it will be terrifying as hell i just stayed in the starting realm for like 10 hours. Later i was just like whatever on everything. I hope i'll get that in NMS too. Just started playing yesterday and just like in subnautica, I didn't know about creepy monsters :D</TEXT>

I can't really tell what i like about this game but I guess it's a mix of exploring endless worlds and building nice bases.

    <TITLE>Turning around in VR</TITLE>
    <DATE>2019-08-06 18:24:18</DATE>
    <TEXT>I want to get a VR headset soon but i have 1 question: How do you turn around in VR? Do you have to physically turn around or is there an option to turn around with the thumbsticks? I can imagine that the cables can get very annoying when you walk up a staircase for example so you have to turn around many times in one direction. Was thinking about some weird moving overhead construction to help me out with that but there must be another option.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>"Since other batteries work fine in the Right controller, that tells us it isn't the controller even though the Eneloop Pro batteries work in the left, it is strange but means different battery will have to be used in the right controller." So it works for everybody else just not for you so just spend 10$ for batteries every week Nice one Oculus Support. If it works for everybody else just not for me it is very likely NOT the batteries fault. So was your co-worker just not willing to help me and someone else can or do i have to look for another VR headset since i can pretty much buy a more expensive one if i have to spend 10$ a week for batteries now.</TEXT>

    <DATE>2020-01-04 01:11:17</DATE>
    <TEXT>So i want a (preferably female) follower who isn't perfect skinned like pretty much all followers are because that gets boring imo. I remember there was a follower in Oldrim, that had a big scar on the belly but i can't remember which one it was. I found a mod that can do to your character what i want for followers but sadly i can't get RaceMenu running in VR: https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/93712 If there was a follower that uses these Scars/Marks that would be awesome.</TEXT>

    <TITLE>Are there any (body) scar meshes to download?</TITLE>
    <DATE>2020-01-10 01:28:45</DATE>
    <TEXT>TLDR: I need some scar meshes to paste to a character in bodyslide So first of all I have no idea about modding. What i want to do is to add some scars/birthmarks etc to my follower sofia in Skyrim VR. I have noticed that there are some really good mods out there for RaceMenu but since that doesn't work and i'm not sure if you can customize followers with this anyway, i was looking for another solution. I tried experimenting with bodyslide and it seems that this might be the solution I was looking for. For testing purposes i copied the wounded meshes from one character and it kinda worked. So now i'm looking for some scar meshes to download and paste to sofia body. Is there any way to get these somewhere?</TEXT>

    <TITLE>Is my Rig usage normal?</TITLE>
    <DATE>2020-02-26 20:13:20</DATE>
    <TEXT>So i noticed, that when playing VR my CPU and GPU usage barely ever goes above 50%. This wouldn't be a problem when the frames still would be at 80 fps (I'm playing on Rift s) but when the frames drop it should get higher or am i wrong? At most games it's fine most of the time as far as I can tell but at certain points it gets annoying. I tested Skyrim, B amp;S, Pavlov, and Twd:S amp;S. My Rig: GTX 1070 I7 8700 16 GB DDR4 MSI Z370 Tomahawk And yeah i know my GPU just meets the requirements for VR but still it should get to 100% usage or not? Will it maybe help to upgrade anything? Any help is welcome</TEXT>

When you run a site which offers support you should answer when someone has questions and not be expecting someone to solve quantum physics equations before even considering answering because that's not how good customer support works. If you didn't have a problem yet then fine good for you. But reading through this reddit i see A LOT of people complaining about customer service playing hide and seek.

    <TEXT>I would even replay the game right now if i didn't knew i had to play as a character i don't like for 10 hours or so. For me it was really exhausting and I had to push myself to continue playing. I really love ND but if you have 10 hours where you have to force yourself to continue it's just not a good game. I liked the end though where ellie concluded with her past and broke the circle of violence like ND calls it even though i REALLY wanted to kill her and even kept smashing square after the scene was over. I just hope in the next game (which should come I guess) they stick to ellie and don't force any characters you hate. I get what they were trying to do but it didn't work.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I loved it too i think(?) i have to sleep over it to make a conclusion but i like the turn they did in the end. even though i kept smashing square at the water scene after it was over so if i had to decide it would have ended different. i guess you know what I mean if you finished it. However i found the last half of the game really exhausting because I just didn't care. That part really put me down a little on my excitement. The rest was pretty good however</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I strongly disagree. They can't just end many peoples favorite character with this ending. Not again. There has to be a happy conclusion in the end or else everyone would be even more pissed if they ended her story on that. I feel like Ellie was always the main protagonist so she also has to end the series. Not saying I wouldn't like spin offs but that can't be the end for ellie or the series would always have a bitter taste you don't want to remember. I liked the game and the ending fit very well imo but only for this game and not the series</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Yeah a spin off would be great. Especially about Joel to calm the tides that are going on right now. They could show what he and Tommy did for survival since they talk about it but never show it and why they split up. The whole world has just so much potential even for new characters. But i desperately want a happy conclusion first for a beloved character that has gone through so much pain like Ellie did</TEXT>

If i knew there was a sequel that makes everything good in the end and not make Ellie loose literally everything i would consider a 10/10 too. It's not because it was badly written or smth and they got me right where they wanted me to be, i think (mild depression and emptiness). But for a 10/10 i want to be happy after a game or at least not that broken. Like i said if there's some follow up and i knew this was not the definitive end that might change my opinion cuz this just can't be the end for ellie</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I completely get you except the girlfriend part. I am not very emotional normally and this game and part 1 showed me emotions I didn't know I had before. After this game i just wanted to squeeze my face into my pillow and cry. I can't remember when I did that the last time tbh maybe in 6th grade when i got my first F or so and that was like 10 years ago. It just has to be a great game for that emotional aspect alone. Yeah some posts here really helped me to get a better understanding of the story and appreciate it even more but the majority here doesn't help. It's even worse on Twitter. I guess we just have to stick to our opinion until people calmed down a little and more have finished it.</TEXT>

I'm trying to decide between the black or carbon ones but i like the carbon ones better if they do match my build and are not to shiny.

    <TEXT>Oh ok so it's actually about aligning the possible fps the 2 can produce? So if I got this right it's not that the GPU can't produce more fps because of the Cpu bottlenecking but about only seeing 300 fps because that's what the CPU gives us? Like the GPU still technically can output the 300 fps but we just see the lowest the whole Pc can produce</TEXT>
