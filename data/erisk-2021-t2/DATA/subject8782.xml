    <TITLE>Pitch your fav profession</TITLE>
    <DATE>2018-04-05 19:48:03</DATE>
    <TEXT>Let me start of by saying that I am fully aware that they're probly a million similar topics and I also know that there is no fully subjective answer to this. Nonetheless, I'd like some advice or input to make a decision. I have played this game on and off since launch but never totally got hooked. I've tried pretty much every class (most of them only 'till around lvl 20-30 tho) and I always find myself lacking something, beeing it mobility, ability to AOE, complexity, etc.. That beeing said, i'd love to hear your ideas on: What class is the most fun/enjoyable to play in PVE (i don't play pvp) during leveling and ultimately in endgame. I plan on doing: map completion, dungeons, fractals, raids. I am aware that there is as many good answers as there is possiblities but what im looking for is people pitching their favorite class so i can understand all the aspects of that class and find out which one attracts me the most. Thank you in advance for your answers.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I've read a couple threads from 10-20ish days ago about the special ammo shortage that occurs on all the signature weapons BUT the sniper. I've unlocked the sniper and have played with that class for about 3-4h. I am ALWAYS out of ammo, i can barely find any. I kill almost every enemy with headshots (using DMR or pistol) and find maybe 1 bullet every 20 enemies killed... what's that all about?</TEXT>

    <TITLE>Use slinger with SnS unsheated (PC)</TITLE>
    <DATE>2019-05-01 07:52:40</DATE>
    <TEXT>Hey y'all I'm sure this was already answered somewhere but I couldn't find a solution : While i have my sword (SnS) out i can activate the reticle of the slinger, but i can't shoot. By default shooting is with LMB but while unsheated, that would result in a Chop attack. So i changed the fire button to MMB, but that doesn't do anything if I have my weapons out. If i sheat my weapons then i works, but I thought one advantage of SnS is to be able to use items and slinger on the go... Can someone help ? Thanks in advance</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Me again. Sorry for the question "spam" but I'm trying real hard to figure this game out on PC, and I'm a total newby to the franchise and to this type of games in general..  #8203; From guides I've seen that you can use the *Helm Breaker* attack with SnS if you run up a wall and then activate it. From what i've seen, on consoles you activate it with triangle, which would translate to LMB on PC (i think). But all I get with LMB is jumping slash. Did they remove this attack? I tried every possible combo i could think of.</TEXT>
