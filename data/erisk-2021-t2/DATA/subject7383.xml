    <TEXT>Jaxonz Positioner is an amazing mod, I personally use it every time I play the game. It allows you to move static objects (furniture, etc), pick them up to put in your inventory, even duplicating them. You can also lock down loose items so they cannot be knocked around. It's a very powerful mod and has the ability to ruin your game if you do stupid stuff, but if you care about decorating your player homes like I do, it's absolutely essential. It even lets you pick up creatures and NPCs to place elsewhere. Generally one of the best mods ever made in my opinion just for the sheer amount of options opened up. I can spend hours messing around with decorating. Another one would be Static Mesh Improvement Mod, it makes many common objects in the environment look significantly better. Also, Relighting Skyrim is a simple but effective visual improvement that adds more lights to the environment. This is but a few of the many mods I have installed that make Skyrim significantly more enjoyable.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>... yeah. Most of my toys are way too big for me to ever concievably be able to use them, owned solely for the colors and, to a lesser extent, how they feel on/in the hands. I've stopped buying things I know I can't ever use, but I'm not going to get rid of the big pretties just because they don't get used. It's never a waste as long as they're enjoyed in some way.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Killing yourself for the environment is exactly as shitty and bad as killing yourself for literally any other reason. All an individual can do is have an infinitesimal (near zero) impact on the environment while inflicting unknowable amounts of psychological damage to those around them.

    <TEXT>For me cutting is a ritual. I've never experienced substance addiction, but when I started cutting I couldn't stop. I've only avoided cutting for 1 day during the month since I first cut. Every day I get up, get my stuff ready, these days I turn on some music, and after I've prepared myself mentally I spend anywhere from 10-20 minutes or more cutting into my skin. The feeling afterward is a cool numb feeling. No need to think. But it fades fast. About an hour or two later the pain sets in. I hate cutting myself. Except for when I *am* cutting, then I can't get enough. The rest of the time I just feel shitty and tired. I've cut on both my thighs, both my forearms (inner and outer), and my right upper arm. I've carved symbols. Some of my most recent cuts are shallow styros (show white and gape) It feels like even though I've only been cutting for a month I've dedicated so much time and energy to cutting myself or things about self harm. And the last time I had a mental breakdown (unfortunately quite recently) I cut all over my left forearm for the first time even after I said I'd avoid that spot. That day I cut 3 times and stayed up for 24 hours straight because of stress. I try to make myself only cut once a day. I can't let myself just cut whenver I want to, then there'd be no limit to how much damage I could do to myself at one time.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>900mg btw I'm not sure how long, it was probably a half hour to an hour. My friend who I was talking to on Discord at the time noted that it came on quicker than she expected (she's an experienced user) it was HBr but it lasted over 24hrs. I couldn't walk straight the next day and food tasted like cardboard When it came over me I got REALLY happy and started obsessing over dragons, and how cool they were... I tried typing stuff about them but my hands were starting to become uncontrollable. I got this weird pain in my hands unless I moved them, like if they were still for a minute I felt this ache in my fingers. It didn't take long for me to go to bed where I proceeded to have a VERY intense period of... cycling confusion. I felt like I was falling asleep and waking up repeatedly (but I wasn't, most likely) and I kept going in and out of different realities, like different versions of my room. One was like a cartoon, one was alien like a red cave, and one time I opened my eyes and it looked like I was seeing through a tube or a tunnel, everything looked stretched and far away. It made me think of Alice in Wonderland. I was totally confused as to whether I was human or something else, I remember that I thought for a bit I was in my next lifetime (I believe in reincarnation) Everything from my everyday life was alien. I had my cat sleeping on my legs and I was aware of him but I kept thinking "c...a...t..." and "Jack...son??" like I'd never even heard these words before. I remember knowing my computer was on and vaguely thinking that I'd done something on it and that I'd taken a drug I had VERY intense and vivid internal visuals, I could see these like mountains or cityscapes morph into green or gold 3D textured layouts. I had a vivid vision of water with duckweed flowing through different black square outlines. And I saw a broken up shell of a brick sphere (black with white outlines) I was listening to music the whole time and I loved all the songs I heard. Some were a bit too intense tho, it was my first time and I didn't know what to pick so I threw a bunch of chill stuff in with intense trap. The chill stuff was the best, 100% I remember at one point sort of coming out of it a bit and realising where I was. Then I tried to get up and do stuff on the computer but I didn't. I ended up basically wasting the rest of the trip by just going to sleep LOL and I had a hard time sleeping 'cause every time I got up I felt confused and had to struggle my way into the bathroom The day after was just as weird as the night of, I was still VERY altered and I kept thinking about embryos and reincarnation (in fact, the concept of reincarnation came up regularly the whole time, during the peak as well) and I was just in love with this photo of someone holding a newborn kitten. I kept thinking about the little things. I was able to regain my typing ability late into the next day, which I was glad for. And for days afterward every time I did my edibles I had a little resurgence of DXM stuff (like needing to close ohne eye to read... yeah...) Next time I do DXM I'm gonna do the same thing but with a lot more weed and grapefruit juice  #129396;</TEXT>

    <TITLE>I kicked my own ass with DXM</TITLE>
    <DATE>2020-09-04 16:43:57</DATE>
    <TEXT>I impulse dosed 900mg. It was not a good idea and I was planning to wait to dex again until like a week from now (when it would be a full month, my usual dosing schedule). But it was late at night (like 4AM) and I was not in the best mindspace and I somehow convinced myself it'd be a good idea to open a bottle of DXM and take "some" of it. I was playing Fallout 4 and just swallowing pills. I had eaten a large amount of chocolate ice cream not long before and I *knew* that dexing was a bad fucking idea, but I thought "A little won't hurt". Yeah, I was just downing pills and after it started hitting I was at least a third way through the 900mg bottle. Things are... a bit fuzzy but at one point I had to go shit (*could* be the DXM, but my body is just Like That) before it *really* started hitting. At one point I looked in the bottle and the thought of swallowing another gelcap grossed me out so I closed it and set it aside to keep playing the game. And I know like an hour later I puked up all the ice cream and maybe some DXM as well, but it was in the toilet unlike last time when I puked all over my floor (or my first time doing LSA when I puked in the sink...) so I just brushed my teeth really quick and went back to my game in my room. I'm genuinely not sure when I went to go lay down but I was listening to music the whole time I was gaming so I took my headphones to bed with me and just layed back listening to [Lorn](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TKLHJ6vqYsM), mostly. What followed was an hours-long Fallout 4 inspired trip with dark / unlit visuals of spaces from the game, and closeups of terrain textures n shit. I mean, I was laying there 'watching' all the shit in my mind move and transform and it was like I couldn't tell whether my eyes were open or closed (I was wearing a sleep mask) and I knew it was light outside. I kept seeing like dry shrubs and twigs and grass and rocks n shit. At one point I remember having this overhead view of these raiders like from the game but they weren't shooting, I just saw them from a slightly shifting perspective overhead. I would get visuals of the "camera" panning over different terrain like roads. And the only first person things were when I kept falling under the map, that happened a few times overall and every time my modded Eyebot companion was there with me. I could literally feel myself falling and I was looking up and I saw how weird the terrain looked from underneath it all. This reminds me of a dream I had when I was in Fallout 4 and I kept going under water and sinking until I forgot I needed to get back to the surface. That was a couple weeks ago. Oh, and at one point I felt myself transform into my character and I was thinking with his voice. That happened 2 separate times and one time I turned into the robot as well. This was also in first person. Another weird part was I kept personifying DXM as "Dexter" and I was thinking of how much I loved "Dexter" and what 'he' wanted to show me. That was super weird. Like I knew it was just a chamical but I felt a very strong connection to it and felt like it was very special. The shitty part was that I went through what felt like an hours long cycle of not knowing what reality I was in, *and* why I was so confused in the first place. Because I did DXM on impulse I forgot that I'd done it at all and I didn't tell anyone beforehand either. So I felt like I was falling asleep and waking up repeatedly, each time not having a clue what "reality" was or what ones were real (some were like... different and not in my human body. It's hard to explain) and I remember thinking of how much I did NOT like the realities where I woke up and had a gross ugly body (that would be...this one of course...) and I was so fucking weirded out by myself and my nude body in general. I had one moment where I was a little clearer and I crawled out of bed and onto the plush chair near my bed and just sat there dazed as fuck and trying to figure out what was even going on. I kept thinking "holy shit DXM is so potent" but not really understanding what DXM was or that I'd taken a drug. I was like this all day and a family member called at like 3-5PM and I had the briefest phone call with her that I don't really remember at all. I think I agreed to call her back but I never did 'cause I was so fucked up (I probably wouldn't even be able to dial TBH) After all that I tried going onto the computer to like at least try to watch my favorite streamer who I knew would be live (catching his stream was so important even when I was fucked outta my mind I thought "Isn't he streaming today? I need to watch that!") but I was just so confused about everything like my headphones weren't plugged in and I kept trying to put them into the computer but I couldn't connect them right and my main monitor wasn't working cause I knocked a water bottle onto the floor that disconnected the cable. So I was super frustrated and just decided fuck it and I slept. I couldn't sleep very well so I kept getting up to go use the computer (by that time I was sober enough to fix what was wrong) and just going back to sleep n shit. In all, it was a really stupid thing I did and I shouldn't fucking impulse dose 900mg especially when I know I'm gonna be dosing in like a week anyway, when I could have prepared with grapefruit juice which cleans up the high a LOT and takes away a lot of the inability to move properly (plus it makes the visuals a lot better, more crisp bright and intense). Next time I will fucking plan it out and not just do it because I try to convince myself I'll do "just a little bit". I know myself well enough to know that once that seal breaks the whole bottle is going into my body and I need to be prepared for that shit. Usually I like the feeling of disconnecting from reality and getting confused over what's real, but I also like remembering that this is the effect of a *drug* and not just some hellish loop I've been thrown into. At points I forgot that I'd taken a drug, at least on some level, so it was literally just my reality being twisted and taken from me for a bit. I love DXM and what it has to offer, and 900mg is my favorite dose, but it's not fun when I do this shit on impulse and throw my future self into a state of total confusion. If I'd planned this out and told someone, I wouldn't have been so messed up, I'd still be dissociated obviously but it wouldn't be as bad as it was and I could actually enjoy the disconnect instead of just being so confused I couldn't enjoy it. And I wasn't a huge fan of the Fallout 4 theming either and at several points I remember thinking "Well it's my fault it's all Fallout 4..." I guess fucking up with DXM was inevitable. I knew at some point I was gonna impulse dose, since there are many times I've thought about dosing before it's actually time to do so. I guess I just wasn't expecting it to be so soon before I was gonna dose anyway, and I think the whole "There's only like a week left until I can do DXM again!!" thing made my already tired self more likely to say 'fuck it' and dex before I was actually ready. I'm going to try and use this as a learning opportunity: This is why I plan my fucking doses instead of just dexing \~whenever\~ This shit is very potent and can *absolutely* fuck me up if I'm not careful.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I was trying to sleep and I had some music on and the fan was on low and I suddenly thought that I needed to sit and listen to the fan because "someone was going to send me instructions on how to make a bomb" and that it would be coded in numbers. I have never thought anything like that before and after I thought it I was confused like I didn't understand why that came into my head. It wasn't a joke. But I didn't actually believe it. It was just... there. I had to get up and I tried to distract myself but I just looked up at the corner of my room and thought "They're going to install cameras and have me on 24/7 surveillence" I'm fucking going insane holy shit I don't believe these thoughts but they're coming into my head randomly. Something is very wrong I did like 600mg DXM then about 15-16 hours later I did like 300 more (with a ton of weed) and I had a fucking bizarre trip like it started okay and then it went bad but then it was okay again and it was like a roller coaster of emotion. I literally went from chill / okay to euphoric, to fucked up about shit I can't elaborate on, to euphoric, to fucked up... I've mostly come down from the DXM, as in, my CEVs are weak and my ability to type and walk is fine, I'm not too dissociated either. I just had to get up and lock the door. I had a thought that "they" were going to come in and plant meth in my apartment and have me sent to jail. These thoughts are so fucking insane I'm freaking out this is not normal in any way. I think I screwed up really bad I'm feeling mostly normal but then I get random intrusive paranoid thoughts like someone's gonna come in here and kill my cat. Or they're gonna put cameras outside my windows to spy on me (complete with overly realistic mental picture from the remaining DXM effects) I'm really not sure what to do I've never felt like this before and these thoughts keep coming up and I can't make it go away. I know **none** of these thoughts are real, 100%, but they still won't leave me alone. I don't know what to do. I'm going to just stay in my room and try not to engage the delusional thoughts, though it's really hard for me to not get up and close my windows and blinds right now It's not like I didn't know redosing was bad for you. I just didn't listen. And now I'm losing my mind I don't know how long this is going to last but I hope it ends soon and doesn't get any worse</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Thank you I was able to get some sleep and the thoughts are a lot less prominent than they were. I'm not going to do DXM again until at least a full month (or more) has passed, which is what I should have been doing anyway. And I'm definitely going to avoid weed for a bit. This is one of the scariest things I've dealt with and I was totally unprepared. Even though before I even took the second dose of DXM I had hesitation because I knew this kind of thing was possible, but stupidly I did it anyway because I thought I could get away with it. My trip was really fucking bizarre, not in the usual DXM way but in an emotionally tumultuous and kinda unhinged way. I won't be making a mistake like this again.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Shit. I've been living alone for 2-3 years and my apartment is totally cluttered. I can get one room clean (with help) but then it's like... oh this other room needs to be cleaned. Then this. and that one too. There is ZERO aesthetic design and my walls are empty. All my lights are depressing bland yellow. I feel like my home is a fucking cage and I want to have a nice, organised space to be in but I can't. fucking. Do it. I want it so bad but I can't get there. I wouldn't be so God damn depressed if I at least lived in a decent-looking space. It doesn't help that a lot of things to visually improve my space to be actually /decorated/ cost $$$ because of course. You'd think being a friendless loser NEET means I'd have all the fucking time in the world to clean, organise and design, but I still go to bed every morning in the same rat den I woke up in. Fuck. I'm trying, I'm trying to improve it but it feels so fucking hard. Everything is so overwhelming I have no idea how normies actually do it. I try not to be jealous but it feels like other people know shit I don't or have a secret \~power\~ to be able to clean. I've been like this for years. I'm working on it. Slowly. Very, very slowly. I'm working on it and trying not to backslide into oblivion. Things used to be a lot worse. But they need to be a lot better or I'll never be healthy I know what I want things to look like. I know exactly what I want but getting to the point where I can actually achieve it is so hard. It's like vision -- gt; cleaning/preparation -- gt; buying the objects with limited cash (each month I can choose 1 or 2 things) -- gt; actually executing the design -- gt; maintaining integrity. So many steps. So many chances to fail day after day. Sometime I feel hopeless. I feel empty, like I have no future. The messier things get, the more depressed I become, the more depressed I become, the messier things get. It never stops and I have to claw my way out of that cycle and rewire my brain somehow.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I only got roboitch the first 2 or so times I took DXM and my last several trips it hasn't been a thing for me at all. I also got a crazy intense flashing light inside my head my first time that never happened again (it comes back in a very, very subtle way when I use morning glory seeds tho for some reason. IDK what it is) It was like I had police lights inside my brain and I remember it being super overwhelming and TBH kinda annoying too.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I've only done it one or two times, and I think it did have an effect. But I'm not totally sure. I hate GFJ a lot so I was only able to choke down so much before I couldn't take it anymore. I want to try grapefruit seed extract to see if that has any similar effects, or GFJ mixed with orange juice to help with the taste. I'll probably try both methods at some point. I remember my CEVs were significantly more detailed and geometric even towards the end of the trip, but I've also had fully-realistic CEVs from DXM and weed alone. I know for a fact weed potentiates DXM like crazy, I once was able to have a 3rd plat like experience off a 1st plat dose just by using a 100mg edible. It was crazy. There weren't as many CEVs as a true 3rd plat though and CEVs are the main draw of DXM for me. I actually re-read your experience after my episode and in a way it was helpful to me to see how wrong things can go when DXM is abused. I'm sorry you had to go through such an awful experience. My episode was a wakeup call for me, I used DXM about 5 times in September, a total of 2.7g. I knew I was playing with fire. I haven't been using DXM a long time, only a few months, and I'd been very strict about using it once a month and no more. But the one time I allowed myself to use it more than once, everything quickly spiraled from there. I love DXM and what it has to offer and the only way I can actually justify using it is if I keep it to a minumum. I think I underestimated the true potency of DXM on some level, I was aware of sigma but for some reason I felt that I was immune. I thought I could get away with it. I'm very, very lucky that my experience didn't last longer than it did. I have a delicate balance of mental health and I can't afford to mess around like I did. Even simply overusing DXM week after week had an effect on my mental health that I only realised in hindsight. DXM in moderation helps me with my anxiety, but in repeated and frequent doses it makes me feel like I have no past or future. That's why I need to catch this before it becomes a big problem. I have no DXM in my home right now and I'm not going to buy more until November, sometime after my birthday in the beginning of the month. I'm going to store it in a secure place as well, a locked box in a drawer. It might be extreme, but it removes the temptation of seeing DXM bottles and being able to just grab and open one.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>For me, gel caps are fine once they're in my body but swallowing them is the problem. I don't get nauseated from DXM alone as long as it's on an empty stomach. You don't have to take such a high dose, but being in bed or laying down with a sleep mask on in a dark room and "letting go" always leads to better experiences for me.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>First thing I want to say, I hate DPH. I think DPH is horrible. I took DPH because I wanted to mentally hurt myself. I will never take DPH again. I'm not going to go into detail about what prompted me to do this to myself, but I will say I knew exactly what I was getting myself into despite never having done a large dose before. My experience was horrible, as expected. I just need to process it at this point. At around 9-10 PM I walked to a local CVS to find and buy some DPH. I wandered the store for a bit until I found it. There were three boxes, I bought two of them. I'm glad I didn't buy all three. Or maybe I wish I did. I took the boxes home with me and cut the pills out of the blister packets, and took all of them, It was unpleasant but not as bad as taking 60 DXM gel caps (I love DXM, I hate syrup and gel caps) After I had taken all the pills I sat in my room listening to a song I really like, and thinking about how I hoped that DPH would fuck me up enough so I'd do something drastic. After a couple loops of the song I left my apartment and started walking around town aimlessly. I sat down at a bus stop and stared at the gas station across the intersection. I got up and kept walking waiting for it to kick in, I really had no idea how long it would take. But when it started hitting I could tell. I walked past a bush that, out of the corner of my eye, looked like my cat, but bigger. This is a common theme throughout this experience. I walked down this obscure back alley and sat down under a tree looking up at the stars. At this point I felt a mild drowsiness, but I got up and kept walking when I saw a car was coming. I'm not totally certain of the exact order of events, but I wandered for quite some time, sitting down at random spots. I remember I sat down in front of a fence, and I was looking at the building across the street. I could hear leaves blowing in the wind on the street but I didn't see them. When I was sitting in front of the fence, I thought I heard an animal walking behind me, so I got up and peered into the yard, I didn't see anything, but I got startled by a plant that I thought was eyes staring at me. There was a moment where I had walked past a leaf on the ground and it morphed for a second. I freaked out internally. My startle response was insane. I also remember, I think I saw this, a tiny car around the corner and a small (like 8 inches tall) person came out of it. At one point when I was walking, a light was behind me and I saw my shadow, except my shadow was wearing a hat with a wide brim. I thought that was weird but it didn't bother me, I'm not sure why. I did think of the shadow people/hat man since I've read people's experiences before. I walked down this dark alley with a small empty grass lot next to it and I could feel my coordination getting worse. I saw a dark bush that I thought was like a person or animal, I don't know. At one point I saw a large clump of tall brown grass blowing in the wind and I kept thinking it was a dog. There was another alley I was walking through, and I saw a cat walking up ahead that then faded away. I kept getting startled by everything because I kept perceiving stuff as things they weren't. I saw a leaf on the ground that looked like it had a face (not realistic or anything). I thought "Am I tripping or does that leaf have a fucking face?" I wanted to pick it up but I didn't. I'm not sure if it was real or just a hallucination. After a bit I realised my coordination was becoming really, really bad and I kept veering to one side or the other, and almost stumbling whenever I turned my head to look at whatever freakish thing caught my attention. I was getting paranoid and shit, too. As I was walking home, I felt like my hands weren't a part of my body. I also kept hearing distant chatter in the ocean sounds (I live on the coast) and occasionally someone saying something in particular that I don't remember, like a name or random words/phrases. When I got home, I don't really remember what I did at first. I think I used the computer and browsed reddit, but I genuinely don't know, everything was so mixed up. My ability to move and walk at this point was comparable to a high level DXM trip, which I'm familiar with. I'm glad I was at home by the time my ability to move became terrible. I had no depth perception and every step was effort. I needed to hold onto things to keep my balance. I had to pee a lot for some reason, I kept getting up to use the bathroom. I was drinking a lot of water though. At one point I looked at the floor in my room and saw some stuff on/under my bathrobe which was on the floor. I knelt down to look at it, I thought my cat had shit or thrown up on my bathrobe. It looked like a pile of shit but it had like a scaly texture to it. I think I touched it and smelled my finger, but that's super hazy, like remembering a dream. I don't think I smelled anything though. I remember being pissed that I'd have to clean that up when I felt better. But when I looked later (even lifting the bathrobe up) I realised there was nothing there. I also at one point got a tickle on my hand and looked down to see a tiny, VERY miniscule spider. And I was like, oh okay it's just a little spider. I didn't do anything about it even though usually if a bug is on me I'll blow on it to get it off. I have no idea if the spider was real, I think it might not have been, as I rarely see spiders in my apartment. For some reason I knew it was a jumping spider. There were many times where I'd go into the bathroom and sit down, and I'd lean forward and my legs were trembling immensely, like, totally shaking uncontrollably. My hands were doing a similar thing as well. Oh, and my heartrate was fucking insane, too. I kept getting these weird hallucinated tentacle things in my vision, they were translucent and ephemeral. Stuff also warped a bit at times. At one point I thought I heard/felt my cat jump onto the back of my chair, but when I turned to look nothing was there. The tentacle things persisted for hours and were really fucking annoying and they freaked me out. Eventually, after it was light out, I tried going to sleep, and at one point I looked over on the other side of the room and saw a little white object gently floating along. For some reason that really scared me. I wasn't able to sleep so I got up and browsed reddit. In the dark spaces next to and behind text, I kept seeing detailed blue translucent people, doing different things like dancing or pointing. If I tried to look right at them they'd disappear though. I had a conversation with a friend on Discord, and it was so fucking hard to type and think of how to word things/ what to say. I'd start a sentence and I'd know what I wanted to write, but then random words came out instead. Or what I was even saying would change halfway through, I'd stop typing and realise I was just putting random words together that didn't reflect my thoughts. I had to correct typos in every word. A lot of them slipped through, though. Toward the end, every time I closed my eyes I'd get intense flashing in my mind's eye, like lightning strikes. Some were brighter than others. This effect I've noticed with other substances (my first DXM trip had such intense flashing it was crazy and annoying as hell) and it's usually only on the comeup and comedown. It made it pretty much impossible to sleep so I stayed up for a bit longer despite being very, very tired. I felt like I was in a half-sleep state as well, it's hard to describe, but DPH gives me the feeling like I'm just about to fall asleep. Not just drowsiness but that transitional phase between being awake and falling into a dream, where you don't have as much control over your thoughts. 24 hours later I was getting very mild visual and auditory intrusions, like random noises playing in my head. But I was no longer shaking and my heartrate was normal. I really wish I didn't do DPH, and especially not that much. Why did I even do DPH? My intended goal was to get so screwed up I'd do something drastic, but that didn't even happen. Part of me wishes I did. Ironically, I was actually pretty scared that I'd end up dying from the overdose, and I'm not sure if I'm out of the woods yet, I don't know that much about DPH toxicity. At this point I'm not sure I really care, to be honest. I know I'm never taking this shit again and if I want to hurt myself I'll take a more traditional approach. This shit is terrible. I was paranoid, scared, shaking, and totally unsure what was real and what wasn't. I hate not really knowing what exactly happened while I was under the influence, because I found a bag of coffee filters in the fridge and one of them in my cat's extra unused food bowl, no memory of what or why that was there or anything. DPH is just insanity in a pill.</TEXT>
