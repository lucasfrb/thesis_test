    <TITLE>Need Help - Problems with support :(</TITLE>
    <DATE>2014-12-22 11:41:05</DATE>
    <TEXT>*English is not my native language - I'm sorry for mistakes* Hey there, I hope you can help me. It would be my last chance before christmas. What happened: I wanted to make a friend and his girlfriend a small christmas present and we all play a lot of Smite. So I bought 800 gems for him and 800 for her. While I bought the second time, the Hi-Rez-Page had an error and both pruchases were granted to my friend but not to his girlfriend. I opened a support-ticket ( 12/18/2014 04:59 AM ) and got a fast answer ( 12/18/2014 06:35 AM ) that it'll be forwarded to the right place. Since then I got no further answer... I ansered a few times and wanted to know what will happen now and when but they are stil not responding :( I just wanted to make a small present but no one can help with this problem... I would accept this time when it would be my fault but it isn't :-( I'll just hope that anyone who can do anything in this case will read this... I wish you all nice holidays and merry christmas.</TEXT>

    <DATE>2015-01-20 12:47:00</DATE>
    <TEXT>Hey, saw this post: http://redd.it/2t1dp1 and got an idea... The conquest map could change with the progress... It starts with 50/50 chaos and order... every time a tower or a phonex gets destroyed the map could become a bit more dark/light. If both teams destroys a tower it'd be 50/50 again. This could also change with the amount of kills or whatever... I think it would be much work to implement this but maybe it's possible (for season 3?) BTW: The idea that the volcano explodes at minute 10 is great! Sorry for my bad English :)</TEXT>

    <TEXT>They have a giveaway for three days and giving 200 keys (100 EU and 100 NA) every day. I checked the site for 12 hours today in a 1-3 minutes intervall. NOW, after 12 hours of hoping for a key I got the message that I can claim one. I should choose between EU and NA. I choosed EU and a window appeared where I could confirm my choice. I took about 5 seconds to get sure that I made the right choice (EU) so I confirmed it. I came back the the site, where I've had to read "No More Keys" the last 12 hours... Is this site just wanting to generate clicks? So damn frustrating -.-' *Edit: /u/HaughtyPandaLove was so generous and gave me a key he had! Thank you so much, I didn't expect that. I'll try to get keys with other giveaways and if I get one, I'll share it with this subreddit!*</TEXT>

    <DATE>2015-03-19 13:12:19</DATE>
    <TEXT>Hey, it bothers me a little bit that there are different rank-images for every 5 ranks in the battlelog but in-game there is only one image for 25(!) ranks. When I look at the scoreboard a want to have a fast overview of what ranks my mates/enemies are. It would be okay if there would be 1 image for 5 ranks because (for me) it is irrelevant if someone is rank 35 or 39. But now someone can be rank 25 or 49 with the same image. What are your thoughts?</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Just bought one for the operator ($ 250.000)... After that you'll recognize, that you need to buy it for the other team, too... Okay but THEN: There are 3-4 different camos for the different maps. So you need about $ 1.500.000 - $ 2.000.000 to buy camos for ONE class... That's cruel. It is okay for me to spend $ 250.000 for one camo per class per team... But why do you have to buy a new one for every map? Opinions?</TEXT>

    <TITLE>Suggestion: Premium-Feature To Record The Last 10 Games Automatically. (E. G. For Youtubers)</TITLE>
    <DATE>2015-07-06 19:27:18</DATE>
    <TEXT>First: I know that most of us don't like to invenst money for little features like this. But keep in mind that storage space costs money and Hi-Rez needs to make some money to keep the game running. I miss the feature that we can watch records of our games. I only had one penta and at this time, shadowplay wasn't running so I'll never have the chance to see my personal highlight in Smite again. I would like to see the possibility of buying a feature, like automatically record the 10 last played games. This would give Hi-Rez some money and only those wo need it, can buy it. Youtubers could use it to make better compilations of Smite with different angles and so on. What do you think? :) PS: The feature is not available in the most games and nearly nobody is complaining about this. Please be constructive with your criticism.</TEXT>

Second issue is, that I use a studio-mic and this one records nearly every(!) sound in my homeoffice (even behind the mic) - In Teamspeak I use voice-activation to solve the problem but shadowplay only allows me to use push to talk (which I dont like) and record all the sound what is destroying my videos because you can hear everything (typing, breathing, the tv 2 rooms away and so on)...
