    <TEXT>Joining marching band really helped with my social awkwardness as a freshman last year and just helped me enjoy school in general. I #8217;m not saying everyone should become a band nerd with no life like me, but just look in to what clubs/athletic programs your school has to see if there #8217;s something you would be interested in. It could really help you make new friends and make your high school experience a little less hellish :)</TEXT>

    <TEXT>These comments are giving me a headache. No one is saying you are inherently evil for being a white straight cis male, you thin-skinned fuck sticks. OP is saying that everyone who isn #8217;t a white straight cis male is treated worse than those who are. I have no idea how anyone who isn #8217;t actively trying to victimize themselves could misread this post that bad. Also, remember kids, if you are heterosexual, cisgender, white, and/or male, you have privilege. Privilege doesn #8217;t mean you are treated like a king, so don #8217;t get defensive saying you can #8217;t be privileged just because you go to public school or aren #8217;t insanely rich. Your privilege means you don #8217;t get treated as bad as LGBTQ+ people, POC and women. It #8217;s not that hard to understand. *r/FragileWhiteRedditor for anyone who wants to see any more of these butthurt dumbasses :)</TEXT>

    <DATE>2020-07-23 21:49:58</DATE>
    <TEXT>*I #8217;m a 14F, and a little underweight. Not sure if this matters but I think there #8217;s a chance I might have anxiety but my mom doesn #8217;t want to take me to a psychiatrist so I #8217;m not sure. Every time I drink something with caffein (coffee, soda, energy drinks etc) I get cramps. They happen in the same spot I get period cramps and sometimes I can #8217;t tell the difference. I don #8217;t know if it #8217;s normal or if it #8217;s because of stress or what. Any advice/ideas on what could be causing it would be very helpful.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>There is literally no way you could phrase this that wouldn #8217;t make you sound ignorant, so I #8217;m going to help you understand. (Btw I am a cis female so I don #8217;t know what it #8217;s like to be transgender. I #8217;m going solely off research I #8217;ve done out of curiosity and from information I have from my trans friends.)  gt;I feel like I could live an equally happy life in the body of the opposite sex. If you had your current brain inside the body of someone of the opposite sex, you would not be happy, because that #8217;s what being trans *is*. There are studies that show that trans people have brains that match their gender identity, not their biological sex.  gt;I just don #8217;t see a problem with living what you have. So, does this apply to people with depression? Anxiety? Gender dysphoria is just as serious and urgently needs to be treated like all other mental disorders*  gt;Lots of people have to get through the disadvantages that come with the race, social class, height, physique, beauty, etc. You can not compare the struggles of a short person to the struggles of a trans person. I #8217;m short, and my biggest problem caused by it is that sometimes I have to stand on my toes to grab a cup from the kitchen cabinet. Trans people have to live through years of hell and spend thousands of dollars of hormones and surgery (if they want to) just so that way they can finally be in a body that doesn #8217;t make them depressed. *i don #8217;t know if dysphoria is classified as a mental disorder or not, feel free to correct me if anyone knows if I #8217;m wrong :)</TEXT>

    <TEXT>You make some good points and I do think that your friends were in the wrong for putting you in that position, however, here's everything wrong with this post: -you act as if dating an overweight person is completely out of the realm of possibility and that OBVIOUSLY nobody would EVER want to date someone who isn't skinny, which is bullshit -you act the same way about dating people with Down syndrome, which is also bullshit -seriously, imagine someone saying "sorry, you might be a good person but you're black so there's no way I'd find you attractive" like it's ok to have preferences but there's a difference between a preference and just being an asshole -you used the term "blue headed girls", which is an argument used by men who hate feminism to mock women who want to be treated like people -your friend is transphobic AND misogynistic because he 1) rejected a romantic relationship with a trans girl for the sole reason that she was trans 2) thinks that women are nothing more than what's in between their legs and on their chests But hey what would I know, I'm just a stupid blue haired obese liberal f*ggot  #129322;</TEXT>

I like the peaceful protests and if we can get things done without being violent then we shouldn't be violent. However, if the police are going to attack us no matter what and if throwing bricks at cop cars is going to get the message across more clearly, so be it.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I mean, guys have struggles too but women have had worse struggles for most of human history. Women weren't allowed to vote until 1920, and even then it was just the white women. I was told I couldnt wear a tank top to school when I was 5 because it was innapropriate, it didn't even show anything it was just a normal tank top but misogyny is still so present in the world that a literal child showing their shoulders is considered sexual. Not trying to make it a competition, but it would be wrong to just dismiss actual problems in the world by pretending that everyone is treated equally, like the people who counter BLM with ALM.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Yeah no shit everyone here understands that you can't change your biological sex you prick. But there is a **difference between sex and gender**. Sex is what chromosomes you're born with. XX, XY, and a slew of others that make intersex babies. So even if sex did determine gender, there would still be more outcomes than male or female. Gender is a social construct based around sex. There is no such thing as masculine or feminine, it's all shit we made up. If you want proof, pink was seen as a masc color while blue was femme, but during the Holocaust the Nazis made gay men wear pink patches while in concentration camps which made the colors flip flop. Also, there have been multiple studies showing that trans women have brains shaped like cisgender women's, and vice versa for trans men. So there is proof that just because you have male genitilia doesn't mean your gender is male. But sure, you, a random middle schooler, know more about the study of gender and sex than actual scientists who have dedicated their life to understanding it.</TEXT>
