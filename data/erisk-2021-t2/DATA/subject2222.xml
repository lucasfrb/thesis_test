    <TITLE>Can anyone help me become a better player?</TITLE>
    <DATE>2020-04-12 02:54:37</DATE>
    <TEXT>I #8217;ve been playing for a while but I still suck. I usually only play classic and the only hero I use is Miya because she #8217;s the only hero where I #8217;m decently good. Lately I #8217;ve been wanting to get a higher rank, but I can #8217;t do that because I #8217;m a shitty player. I was wondering if anyone was willing to help me get better and help me get a higher rank. (idk if I used the proper flair but I tried)</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I #8217;ve actually had this game for a couple of years I just never bothered with learning how to properly play. I first started playing with a friend that was a grandmaster and she basically called all the shots so I didn #8217;t have to worry about figuring things out myself. I #8217;m kinda just useless without her but I #8217;m currently elite. Thanks for the advice!</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Thanks for the advice! I #8217;d say I #8217;m already pretty good at looking at the map and stuff I kinda just suck with 1v1. I #8217;m kinda attached to Miya and she #8217;s the only hero i properly know how to play yet I still can #8217;t 1v1 with her. I heavily rely on other people throughout the entire game regarding fights and stuff but I #8217;m a great push and that #8217;s the only reason I don #8217;t entirely suck. But thx again!</TEXT>

    <TITLE>Do I have misophonia?</TITLE>
    <DATE>2020-04-26 19:30:01</DATE>
    <TEXT>I #8217;ve always absolutely hated chewing sounds. When I was younger, I would get very VERY angry at the people making those sounds. I thought it was norma, and when I got a little older I stopped getting so mad. Drinking, chewing, and some other sounds are still very cringe for me to hear. I don #8217;t eat with my family because I can #8217;t stand the sound of them eating. They #8217;ve always just said I was picky and I guess I just agreed. Recently it #8217;s been getting a little worse though. I can #8217;t stand the sound of myself eating so I have to eat when I #8217;m distracted or when I #8217;m watching something. I cringe at the sound of me gulping and I do it quite often. I tried to eat a banana, but it was absolute torture. I couldn #8217;t do it. The sound was too much. I decided to look up what it could possibly be and apparently I potentially have misophonia. I just wanted to get the opinions of people who actually have it. Also, if anyone has any advice on how to make it less bad, it would be greatly appreciated. Thank you in advance!</TEXT>

    <TEXT>It does help! Thanks for the advice! I #8217;ve noticed that when I try to put earplugs in, it makes the situation even worse. I don #8217;t have to worry about other peoples eating anymore, but my own eating sounds seem amplified. I noticed that headphones with loud-ish music helps, but I don #8217;t always have them. My family just thinks I #8217;m picky, which I probably am, but I #8217;m fine with eating after them. Thanks again!</TEXT>

    <TITLE>Can someone please tell me that my SH makes my feelings valid.</TITLE>
    <DATE>2020-04-30 22:31:05</DATE>
    <TEXT>Can someone please tell me that sh makes my feelings valid. (I #8217;ve posted this somewhere else as well, but I #8217;m terrified that no one will say anything. I thought I had a better chance of people responding here.) I #8217;m a teenaged girl. If I told someone how I felt, they wouldn #8217;t take me seriously. They would say that it #8217;s just a phase or teen angst. Sometimes I don #8217;t think that what I #8217;m feeling is real. I often wonder if it really is teen angst, and if I #8217;m just acting. I feel like I don #8217;t deserve to even have an opinion because I don #8217;t have real problems. I #8217;m not diagnosed with any mental illness. I haven #8217;t really gone to the doctors for that. Even if I did get diagnosed, my parents would just say I #8217;m weak. My parents don #8217;t believe in mental illness. They think those people are just exaggerating and weak. I feel sad all the time. To the point where sometimes I just feel numb. I really really just want to die. I would never do it to myself because I would put my family through immense shame and embarrassment. I #8217;m just hoping for some miracle that just takes me off of this earth as soon as possible. I #8217;ve felt this way for a long time. I #8217;ve never been this extremely sad before, but I feel like I #8217;ve always been sad. When I was around 11 years old, I was going to off myself. My parents got home right when I was about to do it, and I haven #8217;t tried since then. I recently found a couple of journals that I kept when I was in 4th grade and a couple of years after that. They all just talked about being sad. I was and still am a kid, and I have no reason to be sad, but I am. The first time I read the journals, I thought I was being stupid. I was a stupid kid that thought my world was a mess. I asked some people how their 4th grade went, and they all basically said the same thing. They all had happy memories and had a lot of fun. I read the journals again and I realized that maybe I really was sad. I didn #8217;t have any reason to be sad at the age of 8. I still don #8217;t have any reason to be sad. If I told anyone that I felt sad, they #8217;d say it #8217;s a phase and that everyone feels sad. I sh for multiple reasons, but one of them is to prove that my feelings are real. I feel like my scars prove that I #8217;m actually sad. I #8217;m sorry for that long rant about dumb shit, but if you read all of it, please tell me that my sh makes my feelings valid.</TEXT>

    <DATE>2020-06-18 04:54:21</DATE>
    <TEXT>Nine months ago I was gifted a puppy that sadly passed away because of parvo. She was an 8 week old yorkie mix that passed within a week of me having her. She didn #8217;t have any shots when she was given to me. We buried her in our backyard. I didn #8217;t plan on ever receiving another puppy, but I did. A couple days ago, my brother gave me a 10 week old Labrador mix from a shelter. He has his first set of shots and already went to the vet. He threw up today because he ate too fast, but I got flashbacks of my last puppy. I just started thinking that he isn #8217;t in a very safe environment. I #8217;ve seen that parvo can last up to a year and It has barely been nine months. Parvo can also last a long time in soil, and my puppy has already frolicked in the grass. (He #8217;s not anywhere near where the other puppy got buried, but still) I #8217;m also worried that he #8217;s still young and doesn #8217;t have all of his shots so he #8217;s even more at risk. My house has definitely been sanitized, but how do I know if I sanitized it well enough. I just can #8217;t stop thinking about it, and I feel terrible. I feel terrible now for putting him at risk. What should I do now? Do I need to get him out of this environment or should I stop worrying? I just don #8217;t know what to do, and I really don #8217;t want another puppy to die because of parvo. (He has a vet appointment in two weeks, but idk if I should talk to the vet before then. I also just wanted more opinions or thoughts on this situation, so I came here.)</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I know I should go to a doctor if I really want to know, but I thought getting your opinions would be a good idea. My head has been jerking for years. It just randomly moves to the right. Recently, I realized that the head jerking kinda evolved into other things. My head kinda rolls back and my shoulders go up. My head still jerks to the side, but now it also jerks up and down. I #8217;ve started hitting my own head. Both my arms have just suddenly gone up in the air. I also say happy birthday all year round. I was never really concerned about it until I started hitting my own head. My movements have also gotten a lot more noticeable over the years. Is this what Tourettes it?</TEXT>

    <TITLE>Can I have Tourettes without a vocal tic?</TITLE>
    <DATE>2020-07-24 20:17:53</DATE>
    <TEXT>I initially thought I had Tourette syndrome. From people online and google, I saw that Tourette syndrome includes at least two motor tics and one verbal tic. I don #8217;t have any verbal tics, so I just assumed I have a different tic disorder. I recently saw a psychiatrist for the first time and he mentioned it was probably Tourettes. When I brought up the fact that I don #8217;t have any verbal tics, he said it didn #8217;t matter. He said it was any combination of tics. Is he right? I feel like he #8217;s defying everything I ever knew about Tourettes. Is what he said right? Could I have Tourettes without a vocal tic?</TEXT>

I could hear people talking about me and the staring was pretty bad. How do I go out and act like a normal person. Am I just not supposed to leave my house? Btw I was recently diagnosed with Tourette #8217;s but I #8217;ve had it for years but very unnoticeable up until a couple of months. It keeps getting worse. I #8217;ve gotten meds, but they don #8217;t work.</TEXT>
