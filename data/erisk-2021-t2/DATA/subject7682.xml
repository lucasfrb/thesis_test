    <TEXT>A lot of people believe RF4, but while I found the amount of content and replayability impressive, I believe RF3 to be the best, personally. There was more depth to the characters, your relationships with those characters were less formulaic, and the story was engaging. It also introduced new and better combat functions than prior titles. Meanwhile, I have to nominate RF1 for the best dungeons. I found RF4's dungeons repetitive and predictable with unnecessarily small rooms, while RF3 and RF2 had good dungeons, but too few of them.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>This is amazing. Honestly, it's especially amazing for people who are interested in using the voice clips for messing around in mods or remakes...just sayin' if you ever feel compelled to upload voice clips from RF1, that would be absolutely incredible. All in all, keep up the good work, this is cool!</TEXT>

    <TITLE>Forte! (first time drawing manga)</TITLE>
    <DATE>2020-03-05 04:01:43</DATE>
    <TEXT>New to Reddit, and wanted my first post to be in the Rune Factory subreddit. Here's some art I did of Forte early last year when I tried dipping my toes into the manga art style. Still quite proud of it, apart from the slightly awkward spacing of the right eye and the wacky shape and lack of depth on the left end of her visor.

    <TEXT>Been a while since I've immersed myself in day trading terms and such, so if my understanding is off, someone let me know and correct me. But from what I remember, Inverse ETFs are essentially a bet on whether or not something will rise or fall. So in this case, when you buy into JNUG, you're saying "I think gold is going to do really well". Meanwhile with JDST, you're saying "I think gold isn't going to do very well". Consequently, when JNUG falls, JDST rises, and vice versa. JNUG will fall when the value of gold declines, because it means the bulls were wrong. Effectively, what this means is it's virtually pointless to hold both at the same time.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>As a followup. If you're new to investing and not just new to this, I want to advise you to consider long-term investing. Many good strategies; I prefer a dividend strategy. A much safer approach, and in the end provides a higher yield and you pay less in taxes. I learned all of this the hard way when I thought I knew what I was doing (I didn't). Lost a near $400 in the stock market. What's more, there's no more perfect time than now to start a long term portfolio, while the Coronavirus has suppressed the market into a huge discount. Buy now and after all of this blows over you'll be sitting on a fat stack of cash. At the end of the day though, risk management is very important. So apply that to any and every method or strategy.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Take it slow! RF3 is probably my personal favorite Rune Factory game, and I burned through it quickly. It DOES have replay value, but it is nevertheless a very short play in terms of the story; there are only 5 dungeons, and of course a labyrinth afterward iirc. Not suggesting to play less, but rather enjoy everything the game has to offer in the moment before moving onto the next thing. Hope you enjoy the game!</TEXT>

    <TEXT>It's a subject of discussion I see often on this subreddit. Some believe (very rightly) that it's a way they catered to a particular perverted audience, others deny that and assert that it's more likely they made Amber a bachelorette for the "younger audience." I personally also agree with the former assertion; to be quite candid, as a young boy growing up with these games, I wasn't fixated on the younger characters just because I was young like them, I remember being more fixated on characters who featured very mature female forms; RF1 Sabrina, RF2 Alicia, RF3 Pia/Evelyn, etc. "Younger audiences" of the game simply don't think that way, being in the position that they're in in life and being immersed in the (esp. if in the U.S.) very sexualizing culture that surrounds them. So yes, it is creepy. Lest literally has to explain what dating  amp; love is to Amber. Freaks me out. And people who appeal to the lore of her perhaps being really really old to excuse the issue at hand of her having such childlike mannerisms  amp; looks in tandem with being a marriage candidate is a bit sickening as well, imo.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>So happy to hear of how others came to grow with and love the series. I've been playing since the 1st game, bought RFF within the last year and want to give it another go (and have yet to try ToD), but I was hooked the moment my brother and I entered a GameStop (imagine...) and each picked up a copy of the 1st game. We'd play all the time, filling in game flaws with our own imagination  #8212; EG, our own dialogue wherever the games lacked. Sometimes I wonder how different our relationship might be if we hadn't grown up playing the series together almost 24/7.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>RF4's dialogue feels to me like filler most of the time. It seems that what developers got from consumers was exclusively "we want more dialogue", and not "we want more good dialogue". The Y button was, second to my joystick, my most used button during the installment. RF2 and RF3 are a great example of good dialogue. Instead, RF4 just went for quantity over quality. Praying RF5 will feature more good dialogue.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>That was my attitude during 3 and 4, I think they spoiled the player too much. I enjoyed crafting in 1, though; hard to get a good weapon from some random chest. I was grinding for the next ingredient, and the next, until I got the great weapon I wanted. I am also turned off to the way RF4 handled crafting; a clever idea, having categories determine some items required to forge something rather than specific items, yet it took the thrill out of hunting down particular monsters for those specific items.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>For me it's second to RF3. :) the buildup in it will always give me the chills. They did not, as far as I am aware. There are MULTIPLE places online saying that the song, called "Rune", is sung by an artist called "Lil'" or sometimes spelled "\~Lil", but never found anything on that. However, I recently (as in literally right now lol) found it's actually stylized "LIL" and was able to dig up some limited information on them. The Japanese pop duo is comprised of producer Toshimichi Tsuge (aka TSUGE) and Ucio (aka Yushio), and looks like single discography of "Rune" is not in sight as it must have been a deliberate contract to make the song for the game. Regardless, here are a few links to that limited information about the duo: [https://www.youtube.com/user/lil](https://www.youtube.com/user/lil) [https://www.discogs.com/artist/1771232-LIL-5](https://www.discogs.com/artist/1771232-LIL-5) [https://www.youtube.com/user/ucosong](https://www.youtube.com/user/ucosong) [https://ja.wikipedia.org/wiki/LIL](https://ja.wikipedia.org/wiki/LIL)</TEXT>

    <TEXT>My advice is to try 1 first thing. It has a lot of ugly hindrances that the series improved on over time, but it would be unfortunate to spoil yourself with those improvements and not be able to see the beauty in the first title due to the distracting control layout and such. It has the best dungeons in the series by far. If however, those hindrances are too much to bear, skip 1 and play RF3 or RF2 in whatever order. RF3 is, gameplay-wise and character cast-wise, the best imo. RF2 however, is very memorable and the child protagonist(s) are written in very well. As a GAME, RF3 gt;RF2, that one's just hard for me to say as I have so much nostalgia playing RF2 24/7 as a kid.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Remake! I put [Dev Vlogs](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLI4a6NIVbpqJZ--EYopvfRon7okPkwUya) up for it now and then. I've been crafting it primarily so I can get a frame of reference for making my own original game in the genre.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I am quite skeptical, myself. Given this over-shoulder 3D feel didn't go 100% for all fans with Frontier and ToD, I have to wonder why they chose to close a 8-9 year gap between titles with that formula--and for one of the main installments, at that. Regardless, it definitely has visuals going for it, the colors make me happy. Hoping to see some quality improvements in the gameplay in future trailers, though, personally; namely the farming.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>In summary, I'd like to construct a game of the genre that is my own, someday. I decided to learn how in UE4 by recreating the first Rune Factory game. I upload [Dev Vlogs](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLI4a6NIVbpqJZ--EYopvfRon7okPkwUya) now and then. No guarantee for a release of this fan project, but if I see it through to the end I'll consider reaching out to HAKAMA about it -- regardless, it all comes out to creating my own original farming slice-of-life rpg game in the future.</TEXT>

    <TITLE>After a few months of work and getting around my full time job hours, I've finally finished enough battle  amp; animation mechanics to create Dev Vlog 4 for my fan remake of Rune Factory (2006)! Thank you to those who've been following the project; I love this community so much.</TITLE>

    <TEXT>Haha, yeah, it was quite a task. That's why I'll be cutting back and doing casual dev videos a little more often - but I'm so glad you liked the editing in this one!</TEXT>
