    <TITLE>OnePlus 7T McLaren Edition Screen Protector</TITLE>
    <DATE>2020-01-02 04:30:00</DATE>
    <TEXT>What do you guys recommend for a screen protector? I bought one off of Amazon that only had adhesive on the edge and didn't stick AT ALL. Absolute garbage and now I don't trust any of the glass screen protectors there. Not a fan of film protectors but if they're literally the only good option then I will be willing.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>So when Robin got caught by the Ninja squad and cornered her, they all attacked her. However, she escaped and revealed that the one they attacked was a copy. She came out of it seemingly with no damage whatsowver, even though the clone was clearly attacked. My question is did she overcome her weakness of sharing damage with her clones? How could she even do such a thing? Her clones are literally her and her body parts.</TEXT>

    <DATE>2020-06-18 01:11:51</DATE>
    <TEXT>I'm on a crusade to tame all of the high level monsters at max enemy levels. It's hard enough that I have to get lucky with a particular monster to even appear in Banquet of Nightmares, but Dead Tree is particularly tough since it's attacks seem to be physical. Im having a hard time dodging all of the apples that circle it and the ones that drop from the sky. A single apple will one shot me. Anyone have any advice to get this thing? I know about brushing and love attack weapons, but that seems to be impossible at this point.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I'm familiar with how to get to specific monsters and taming them. I've already got all the faeries both large and small, Terrable, Firesome, Grimoire, Ambrosia, Siren, and Deathwall. It's still tedious and difficult regardless. It's still not that easy to dodge when you have a 1 character width space to dodge the falling apples while still having to dodge the circling apples. And then brushing and feeding is another hurdle to go through when you can be one shot by any of the 20 or so flying projectiles.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I don't think Karina's spiral is good at all and I can't fathom why she's been put up so high on a pedestal. She got a buff skill on her S2. Her self buffs are insignificant compared to the amount of buffs she can get from teammates, so that change doesn't do much for her. She gets 100% skill prep, but she could do that before. She got practically no increase in skill damage, so any significant increase in damage since her spiral is attributable to solely the increased stats she gets from additional levels and spirals. I don't like the drastic change in people's opinions of her viability when she's pretty much the same and was usable before spiral. It might have to do with there being no content for water stun units, but we'll never know.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>We all know it's a horrible system that doesn't in any way promote actually mentoring people and is nothing but a mere limited wrymite farm. Additionally, hdts are dead content that are beaten by much easier quests with much better rewards. However, I think there should be a change to make the grind less tedious and horrible than it is. They should change it so that you get a mentor bonus for each person that gets a first clear. And I don't understand why this isn't the case. The current system is set up that if you manage to carry 3 other newbies, whether or not they contribute in anyway (just ran with 2 3k might newbies), you only get one bonus. I've already left my feedback. Hopefully if this gets enough traction a change is made, or the system in it's entirety gets a look over.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>That wasn't the point? "A small improvement". I've already stated the system is crap. The point was that since it's only used for hunting wrymite, make it a little less crap at least. I even mention at the end that bringing notice to it could lead them to looking at the whole system over. If anything, having to hunt for it less means those people just wanting to play the game run into less hunters. Also, what does that have to do with the other poster talking about wanting more wrymite?</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Is this an atypical run? I got drastically different results and it looks like it has to do with my dps units getting debuffed at the beginning while yours doesn't. Your units seem to achieve the miracle of the melee units successfully walking through Tarty to avoid his first dash, the ranged units avoiding being sucked in by the black hole, and the melee units avoiding being blown up by the black hole afterwards. Chitose 45 mc, different 50% skill prep print, 0UB TSG Malora summer paladyns, odd sparrows Faf and dracolith not maxed Those differences affect dps, but it doesn't matter since they're getting debuffed anyways.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>This team worked a lot better for me than the other one, even though I had the same units. I think the 25% skill prep instead of 50% helped with the iframe and the additional ranged unit made it one less melee unit to get debuffed. I ran the other team so many times and would only rarely get a clear but this one worked immediately and I even got a 1:31 clear. I had to swap Scleo for Mitsu in the line up order though so that if Chitose went down or was stuck in a bubble, the second unit wouldn't go into the portal because they aren't a melee.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I have the pro. Honestly, I'd change it if i could. It has some problems. Some settings might change randomly. Most apparent is the auto dim setting. Sometimes it'll turn off on its own. It'll also sometimes lag with certain applications. An example is when I'm typing on a message board on a browser, the test doesn't display at all unless I switch home and back. It could just be the browser, but I have the same issue with the reddit app with posts not loading unless I back out then in again. My biggest problem with gaming though is that you can't hide the home bar, so while playing coop, I'll accidentally click the home or recent apps button and I'd immediately get kicked out.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I agree with your logic regarding spending a lot of time looking at your own character. I thought about having the indicators on your own character too. But I also thought it would basically be going off all the time because there are so many enemies targeting you, you wouldn't know how to react properly. Unless they fundamentally change the way enemy targeting works, I think that will be an issue. Another problem I have with the current system is that if your camera is directly behind your character and you're hitting someone, it's a very good chance that you'll completely block their model and it would be very difficult to watch for any tells from the enemy unless you play with the camera at an angle.

That's why I'm attacking air. Then I dodged twice to close the gap, at which point I was behind him and the bullets freaking looped up and tagged me while I was behind him.

I'm flying through the stage, I see the first enemy I meet, and a lone enemy too, and blast him while I approach. I'm supposed to weigh all of my options, a god blast, a pin, etc., instead of just smashing a guy after I spawn in because I want to hammer something, all in literally less than a second from indication to release of the attack.

What else I'd like to see upcoming is camera improvements. Camera distance would be nice. Also they way the camera wraps around when you're in a wall. Instead of having the camera squish up close when you turn into a wall, it should remain the same distance and obstacles should just go transparent like in lots of other games.</TEXT>

I saved for so long up to this point that I had 33k wrymite, 120+ single tickets, and 10 ten fold tickets, and I was so itching to summon that I wasted over 340 summons on the first banner to get nothing useful other than the sigil summon. Now I'm down to nothing with only 4 MS0, a bunch of fucking useless dragon dupes, and a single dupe adventurer in Cassandra. Not only will I not have Menee or Gala Zena, I also won't have Ilia in the next banner. I wasted my anniversary summons. :'(</TEXT>

    <TITLE>What is even the point of restart from checkpoint?</TITLE>
    <DATE>2020-10-04 10:28:06</DATE>
    <TEXT>The only reason anyone would ever restart from checkpoint is if the game broke or if they want a do over. But the latter hardly matters when mistakes are saved anyways. Got unlucky and downed by an attack you didn't see coming? Too bad, it's on your permanent record now. Restart checkpoint does nothing useful in its current state other than to hopefully reset a buggy and broken mess.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Your logic is arguing that bugs are fine and okay. If that's the point of the restart then what happens to it if the game isn't broken like it should be? If you want to 100% a stage and you mess up, you have to start from the beginning anyways, so that part of your argument isn't good either.</TEXT>

Please CD, just clear the slate with ranking when you actually restart. That way you don't have to redo 30 min - 1 hr missions over and over again. Especially with all of the jank with combat.</TEXT>

    <TITLE>QoL: Change to checkpoint restart desperately needed.</TITLE>
    <DATE>2020-10-07 04:59:11</DATE>
    <TEXT>When the best loot is tied to mission rewards at 100%, why would you make it so that we have to play perfectly the entire match? If we make one mistake and get downed, you want us to start over from the beginning? Restarting from checkpoint doesn't reset star losses from being downed. It needs to be changed so that the match is reset after you restart that section, as you would expect it to. It's so disheartening and often rage inducing when you fight for 30 mins or an hour and then get punched or shot in the back and now all of sudden if you want the best gear drop at the end you have to start over.</TEXT>
