    <TITLE>Can someone explain this to me?</TITLE>
    <DATE>2020-03-06 15:28:00</DATE>
    <TEXT>Today I played a map again and almost SS'ed the map. I only had 1x100 so it was my best run on this map yet. But when I looked at my scoreboard a past play was on first play in which I had missed the SS by 2x100. Now my question is why the 2x100 run is in first place and not my 1x100 run. The combo is the same, the only difference is 1x100. Can someone explain this to me?  #8203; Old run: [https://i.imgur.com/gVY41YJ.jpg](https://i.imgur.com/gVY41YJ.jpg) New run: [https://i.imgur.com/1B4vHDR.jpg](https://i.imgur.com/1B4vHDR.jpg) Scoreboard: [https://i.imgur.com/mqsjEQW.png](https://i.imgur.com/mqsjEQW.png)</TEXT>

    <DATE>2020-03-15 17:09:19</DATE>
    <TEXT>Hey there, I wanted to start a party with some friends of mine. I'll be dming for the first time and the others play for the first time. Right now there are three players, maybe a fourth one will join. I'll be using the 3.5 version since that's the one my dm is using and I have the books for that as well. Now I've been wondering if anyone has some starter friendly campaigns or know where I can find some. I want to write my own in the future but right now I think it's better if I use a finished one to learn dming in general first. I'd also be really grateful for any advice or things I should/could do. English is fine but if someone has something german it would be nice too since I wouldn't have to translate it for the party. Thanks a lot in advance!</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I know the islands you visit with nook miles are random but it still feels like Im doing something wrong. Ive used about 20 tickets so far and all the island had my native fruit and Ive only seen my native type of fower and one other. The only new things I got are one type of flower and coconuts. No special fruits or flowers, no special spawns of fish or insects and no abnormal amount of rocks or anything. Am I just really unlucky or do I have to do anything to get "better" islands?</TEXT>

I always played it in german which made way more sense since its called "Sternis", which is the german word for star+is. Anyone got an idea?

    <TEXT>Meine Mutter und ich haben heute angefangen Masken zu n #228;hen und wollen diese f #252;r einen freiwilligen Betrag verkaufen und den Erl #246;s dann spenden, zum Beispiel einer Hundepension, die aktuell kostenlos Hunde aufnimmt f #252;r Leute, die sich auf Grund von Infektion usw. nicht um sie k #252;mmern k #246;nnen. Die Masken sind aus 100% Baumwolle, also mit 60 #176; waschbar und wiederverwendbar und besitzen ein Fach, in welches ein Filter reingegeben werden kann. Wir brauchen gemeinsam aktell etwa 20 bis 15 Minuten pro Maske und ich wollte euch fragen, was ihr bereit w #228;r f #252;r so eine Maske zu zahlen, da wir uns nicht sicher sind, was wir unseren Freunden und Bekannten als "Richtwert" sagen sollen. Wir haben verschiedene Stoffe mit Mustern zuhause, ich kann euch auch per Anfrage Bilder schicken (Allerdings erst morgen, da die ersten gerade in der W #228;sche sind, aktuell hab ich nur eines von meiner Maske im Pandadesign). TL;DR: Wir machen 100% Baumwollmasken mit Filterfach. Wieviel w #228;rt ihr daf #252;r bereit zu zahlen, wenn der Erl #246;s gespendet wird?</TEXT>

I had a similar problem with my ex where hed wish id express it more. We tried it and he would simply remind me, if he was feeling like I wouldnt express myself enough. It worked and after some time I got used to it and im really glad i "learned" it.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Just talk with her about it. I dont think anything bad will happen if you tell her and talk about it. Our neighbours had children pretty late too. The only thing I as a child see is that when you have older parents is that they cant play with you outside that much as younger children, thats why I always felt a bit bad for them. But just talk about it and maybe she wants one too. Youll never know unless you bring it up.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Some people, me including, also do it to release stress too. It was a bad combination for me with my already huge self hatred. Its just like letting air out of a floaty toy you have in a pool. People grow desperate and I also think that getting neglected makes those feelings even stronger. If youre at a point you dont know what to do and find out about self harm and you hear that it makes you better and you think you have no options left you just do it because you have nothing left to lose. Thats at least how it was for me. Im not saying self harm is good or anything but some people have nothing else they can grasp on and thats what gets them started. Maybe you even know a couple of people who do it. People tend to find ways to hide it and not always use their arm as you may know. I used my thigh since Ive always hated shorts and never wore something that showed my thighs so its really easy to hide. Since Ive started with the intend that I never wanted anyone to know, thats how I dealt with it. Some people dont care if they get seen and I think only a real small amount actually does it for the attention it gets them. I know someone already explained it to you but since you seemed curious I thought Id share my story too. Sorry if its hard to understand. English is not my native language and I also just woke up to my neighbours fighting amd this really released some stress for me instead of something I should and do not want to do.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Im in a similar situation that shes in although without someone showing interest at the moment so Im trying to explain how I would feel about it. I dont know how her relationships where but Ive been told a couple of times that people take care of me and promised that they would stay by my side just to get pushed away when I hit rock bottom. For me Im just scared that it happens again and that I would lose a person whos dear to me and whom I might even love, developing feelings I cant stop and getting hurt in the end because it seems that it always end in a bad way. Its nothing someone, or at least I, can really control and I guess it just takes time. When she says she wants do forget what youve had and put in some distance it might be more for herself so she doesnt develop any more feelings than she already has because she might tend to get overwhelmed by those and then might start a relationship shes not ready for. The only advise I can give you is just stay by her side as a friend and support her and dont push her if youre ready to wait for her. Its not guaranteed that youll get together in the future but I think thats the thing I would want. Someone you can depend on and helps you heal. I know this sounds selfish and frienzoneish. But I guess thats all you can do for now based on my opinion and experience.</TEXT>

Sadly, theres not much we can do about it except for moving on woth our lives and hoping to get better. If you want to talk or just vent about thinks feel free to message my.

    <TEXT>I was in a similar situation as your gf once. It was very unlikely for me to get pregnant since women who take the pill for a long time have trouble getting pregnant but I was still worried af. I think its normal for her to freak out but its not ok to take it out on you. Maybe you can sit down and talk about it. About how worried you are too and that its taking a toll on you. Maybe she doesnt realize it. Itll be a hard time until you know for sure and itll stress her out a lot since there might be a lot of pressure on her if she is pregnant as a 16 year old. I was 21 and was still worried what people might think about me if it happened and I dont think I can imagine how stressed out she must be and you too. Things will work out for you guys Im sure of it. Talk about it properly and when everythings over youll have a good laugh (at least I had about my stupid worries).</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I got to know this guy last summer amd fell in love over time somewhere in fall. We developed f+ and later on I found out he had a gf although he asured me he didnt have one multiple times. That was in late fall. I forgave him since it seemed like he was really sorry and he was crying a lot. I still wanted more but accepted that he just wasnt ready for a relationship yet. Things continued and we promised to just comfort each other and feel good together and tell the other person if there was something going on with someone else/ if feelings start to grow with for someone else. Starting this year we played some games online together with some of his friends and I heard him talking to his "babe" in the background while we were in a groupcall. Found out he had lied to me about litterally anything and would lie even further when I had prove he lied to me about certain things. So I guess it took me about 3 months from the first huge red flag to notice he was up to no good.</TEXT>

Its also not your typical "op main character wins every battle with the power of love/friendship" stuff. Its about winning and losing in live and evolving as a person. Its just wholesome imo.

But wanna know whats really good? Fresh spring water from the alps. Its the most refreshing and tastiest shit I ever drank. But when we were in italy for vacation you couldnt realky drink it from the sink. It tasted like chlorine so we either got bottled water or they had some machines where you could get water. At least thats my experience.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>We went to a chinese restaurant when I was 17. I made sure I look pretty so I wore a dress and even heels which I never wear so I cant walk around that much with them. Since he invited me he checked the bus connection back home, since we were still wroking on getting our license back them. My mom drove us to the restaurant, we had some really nice dinner and after some time passed we decided to go home. The restaurant was in the middle of nowhere and the next city was about 3km away and that was where we were headed. Bus stop was outside next to the restaurant so we went there and he checked for the next bus. It was out of order. Now we stood there. It was around 10pm in fall and it was raining just a little bit. I didnt really dress up planing we where out for a long time so I started freezing shortly after. We called our families and relatives but noone answered so we started walking on the road with speedlimit 80 km/h and me with heels I can hardly walk in to the next city in about 3km. The reason why I was really pissed is because he promised everything was planned and he was very proud of it and even braged about how he had planned everything into detail. Too bad he didnt look if the bus was still running at this hour. Somewhere in the middel of our way his uncle called back and said hed pick us up in the next city. What a great first date that was.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Hey there, Im a 22 y/o female, Im 163cm (5'4") and have around 65kg. I dont own scale but thats what it said the last time and I still have pretty much the same figure as I had back then. I live alone in a small flat and Id love to get in shape since I dont like my body the way it is now. Since gyms arent open and I dont have spare money for it anyway I was wondering if some of you have some routines or ideas on what I could do with things everyone has at home and what not. I want to go for an hour(ish) long walk every day starting tomorrow and I also own a small training thing for my tighs I can use while I watch something. I know jogging or running would be better but my knees start hurting after a short amount of time thats why I just walk. What do you guys do to stay in shape and lose some weight at home? Any advice for a lazy person like me to get started and keep going? Anything is apreciated!</TEXT>

    <TEXT>So i recently started kinda enjoying "clam hunting" and now have a bit over 100 bait that I dont really need. Id be willing to sell them or trade them for items. For items Im mostly looking for nice outdoor stuff or things that fit in an asian styled living room. Since I dont really have any items I want I wont make a list but might add one if I get a couple from you guys. For money I dont really know what to ask for. I saw people selling 100 bait for one million bells but I think thats too much so Id like to leave it to you. Since Im enjoying my "clam hunting" Id also be willing to farm some more if I run out and someone still wants some.</TEXT>

But one day it was so bad i had trouble breathing and had to be brought to the hospital for some cortisone because I was reacting to it pretty badly. Since then I take my mediaction every year even if its harldy noticable. Scary what some plants can do to you by simply existing.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>To be honest, I dont know yet. But what keeps me going are for example my pets. I also try to tell myself that things have to get better at some point. It already got better a little bit so I just hold on to that and hope for it to keep getting better. I also try to focus on little things like when I eat something amd it tastes good I try to get as much joy from it as possible. My therapist also helped me a lot but I think you are the person who has the power to make it stop. Not now but for the future. Dont give in to it because one day you look back and think "Im glad I stayed strong and could experience this". Anything can make you feel that way be it reading a book you enjoyed or getting to know a person who you like and become friends with. Whatever happens I hope you stay stong and keep going!

    <TEXT>Have you tried talking to him? About how it hurts your feelings? I mean, in my opinion there are no hetero or homo hobbies just as there are no male or female hobbies. The way I see it your bf is the problem. Do you know why he hates "straight" things? Maybe hes afraid of losing you to the "hetero" side and thats where his hate comes from? I would try talking to him and tell him that theres no need to be afraid of losing you to them if thats what he fears. Whatever happens you should know that its ok to have "straight" hobbies and friends, although I dont think that thats a type of hobby. I wish you the best and hope things work out with your bf!</TEXT>

    <TEXT>The past few weeks I played I noticed that sometimes while playing that I feel like I should have hit a circle but it doesnt. If its just one miss and the rest is fine I dont think much about it but recently its more like it doesnt register I tapped. Im playing and suddenly I have lots of misses until I die although I could swear I tapped. The only way I can explain it is that I tapped, but it didnt register that so the circle is still there when I want to tap the next one thus everything that follows misses since Im off by one circle. Does that make sense? I played a couple of maps with other keys and it feels better but I could also imagine things since its not happening every map but only sometimes. Can anyone help me with that?</TEXT>

    <TEXT>This was in primary school. My mom drove me to school for afternoon lessons and because she said they started at 2 and there was still time left I played with a friend outside. Noone else was there and it was just the 2 of us but I didnt think anything of it. Until my teacher came out. She scolded us because we were playing outside while the lessons had already started. It wasnt 2 yet so we were really confused and tried to tell her that my mom said that school started at 2. She didnt believe us and gave us detention. Later found out that lessons started at 1:40 so yeah. That explained a lot. Also wasnt our first time having afternoon lessons.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Nothing too dramatic happened to me. Its just that almost everything that csn go wrong goes wrong. Because of a lot of little accidents in my past I now ended up being depressed without anything. Nothing major happend. I just happened to be born to the wrong family. If I wasnt so sensitive eveything might be alright. If someone told little me to study a bit harder for school it might be different. In the end noone knows what would have happened if whatever happened. Things just keep going wrong and somehow I cant believe that one can be unlucky their whole life so I keep going. My only friend also plays a huge part. Without her I might have ended things quite some time ago. But Im still here and Ill keep on fighting. If not for me I want to do it for her.</TEXT>

One of our favourites were rice noodles with a tomato sauce that contained also chickpeas, tofu, sunflower seeds and chia seeds. You can add things you like and use a different kind of pasta instead. We sometimes added some garlic or onions. It wasnt that high in calories but I dont have the recipie anymore I just make it by taste.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Not made but somehow related. When I was about 13 years old I was exploring a lake on a floaty when we were on vacation. There was a storm the day before so there was awesome stuff to find. Or so I thought. I found something big floating in the water and when I came closer I realized what it was. A dead headless baby cow. I could see the spine standing out and there was a dead rat in its neck. I was shocked and tried to get away. In my panick I fell into the water right next to it. After that I couldnt eat anything cow related for a good 2 years because everytime there was beef or anything Id see this picture and felt like throwing up. About 10 years later I gotta say I love beef once more.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>My uncle raped 3 women before I was even born. They found out when I was 7. He was really nice and would let my cousin and me have snacks in secret. He did look a bit creepy due to a skin condition and because of the way he looked but I never thought He could harm a fly. Also my best friends dad in primary school. He was a really quiet guy but would always take us somewhere and would get us what we asked for foodwise. Except for his creepy look he was one of my favourite adults back then. Everything made sense when he sexually harrassed me later on (end of primary school).</TEXT>

    <TEXT>That number is wrong but thats not my point. The problem is that it is really contaigous and when too many people get infected the health care system cant keep up with looking after the sick and has to chose who they want to save and who they leave on their own because there is a limited amound of machines. And this is where social distancing comes. With that less people get infected at once so the health care system can take care of those who need it. Sure many people dont have huge problems with the virus but if they do the nubmbers should be kept low so people can be safed.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Not exactly what youre looking for but something similar. I was a first year trainee at a bakery and if youre under 18 here youre not allowed to start before 4am. I was 19 at that time and asked if I could start earlier and to help and watch the other baker so I could learn more since the trainee in second year was under 18 at that time and couldnt be there anyway. My boss said no because he wanted to focus on the second year first and he needed me to do the cleaning later around noon. So I said I dont mind doing unpaid overtime I just want to learn stuff since all I did was cleaning amd I really liked the job. He just straight out refused to let me learn something for no reason although he wouldnt have paid more or lost anything by it.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Maybe sit down with them and really talk it out. Try explaining exactly how it is for you and make sure you let them know its not because its them but that it makes you hurt no matter who the person is. Maybe they feel like youre distancing yourself from them and thats their way of making sure youre loved and they care about you. Tell them you have something important to talk about and that you want them to listen to you and try to understand you. That might not be easy but Im sure if you talk about it properly this problem can be solved and neither you nor your family will be hurt anymore by those actions.</TEXT>

Sure, your son has some issues but what youre doing is not ok. Only provide the bare minimum? Why have kids if you dont even want to treat them properly? Youre the adult and it is your responsability to care and look after your child and prepare it for being an adult. If you dont want to do is dont have children in the first place. Youre not listening and not even trying to understand how he feels. All you want is someone to obey you and be quiet. Reading this I feel like hes trying hard to make things work on his own but given the situation hes in that must be a really hard thing to do. I really hope someone helps this poor boy.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>The higher parts to the right you could use for your top 3 villagers. The one you like most on the top layer and the other two on the one under it. Might need some adjustments. And maybe on the bottom layer the other ones to make a small village. People usually make a shopping district close to the airport. I think the place where the river starts looks great and I would probably place my home there. Make sure to take a photo before terraforming so you can later look back at what you had. Just to compare it or you want to go back later on. Otherwise I think the layout of your island looks great!</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I dont think youre weak at all. Youre still going and that shows me that you still have some will to fight left. I know depression sucks. Im currently in my second relaps too amd Ive been home for a year now. I used to be a trainee, baker and confectioner, and I loved this job. It filled me with joy to make people smile with what I made. But due to the toxic work enviroment and my upbringing I relapsed and I had to quit earlier this year because I had to start working again in order for me to get better once more. Then all this shit started and it made things a lot harder. Since my first episode I dropped almost all of my hobbies and there was almost nothing I enjoyed anymore. But looking back things got better. Almost exactly a year ago I hit rock bottom too, just like you. Back then I lived with my ex and I locked myself in our room, having a mental break down again. I didnt know what to do. He yelled at me and all I had to calm me down were my blades. And I think the decision I made back then saved me. I went to the hospital and stayed there for a while due to my mental health. It sucked to be there and even my boss came once to talk about the situation. After that I wanted to take things into my own hands. Sure, I was depressed and wanted to die but I didnt want to waste aways like the people were doing there. Its been really hard since then but in the meanwhile I managed to move out and Im now living on my own. Sure, depression still wont leave me alone amd my place is sometimes pretty messy. But now I am actually able to do something against it by myself. And knowing this gives me strengh. It might not be that big of an achivement but we have to start small. Also, did you know that depression is just agression against yourself? Its just depression telling you that youre a terrible person. I dont believe you are a bad person and Im sure your bf and your friends would agree with me. People just tend to be overwhelmed with someone being depressed and dont know how to handle it. Some dont want to bring it up because they dont know how or they think its rude. I think if you talk with them about it they will gladly help you through your though times. Youre not alone in this. Im sure you can do this. It might take a while to get back to enjoying your hobbies and stuff like that but that time will come again. Depression just makes you stronger and I also think more empathetic. Please dont give up and if you ever want to rant again or need to talk to someone I gladly listen to you. I know just how hard it is to accept the offer but I really mean it and you wouldnt bother me one bit. Im there if you ever need someone to talk to. Youre not alone in this.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>As someone who can relate to you gf since I have similar problems and my mental health isnt that great I have to tell you yes, you probably will be an asshole in her eyes. Which doesnt mean you cant. A relationship involves two people and if one of them has to suffer for the other one to be happy then its wont work. You dont have to justify beaking up with her but I recommend you try explaining it to her in a calm way. It will be rough on her but to be honest it always will and it doesnt matter if you do it now or later. She will be hurt and theres probably no way around it. Its hard to play the caretaker of your partner and you have my respect for dealing with it up until now because its not easy on you. Dont let her being sad holding you back from breaking up if thats what makes you happy. At least thats my opinion.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Hey there, Im 22F from austria and I also spend most of my time infront of my pc. I own a lot of games and am currently playing a lot of sea of thieves, osu and just started playing eco today. I also enjoy things like reading manga or playing d amp;d. If you want we could chat sometimes and see how things go from there. I know the timezone thing might be a problem but considering Im here at 5am in the moring I think I can manage.</TEXT>

Here students may point out mistakes the teacher or professer made grading it and gain points but any mistakes they find after handing it to the student just dont count. Maybe try looking into that if youre out of options.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Our neighbour got it. She had surgery before the whole covid thing got to us in europe and stayed there for I think 2 weeks since shes already 80. Then the thing in italy started and shortly after she and all the other patiens from this smaller hospital suddenly got sent home. I think a few days later it hit our area too. 2 and a half weeks later she was sent to the bigger hospital because she had symtoms and the test was positive. Luckly our area only had a few cases so she could be treated but noone knew how she got it since she stayed home all the time and also had no visitors and her groceries where left in front of her door whenever she needed something. Thanks to the treatment she survived but even after she was better we still didnt know where she got it. Until some nurse found out that the hospital she was in before the breakdown had a case which they didnt really tell anyone about it and just sent everybody home instead. Of course people found out later and people where really angry but nothing really happened to that hospital later as far as I know. Im really glad she is now alive and well. If she would have lived somewhere else where covid hit harder she probably wouldnt have made it simply because she was too old for treatment and it would rather be used on younger people. I wish everyone good luck and hope your loved ones get well soon.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>My mom. When I was in primary school I slept at my best friends place like almost every weekend. That hight her father touched me down there multiple times resulting in me being to scared to go there ever again thus I also lost my friend by this. It took me years to work up the courage to talk about it to someone. When I told my mom all she said was "Yeah what should I do now?" and continued doing the laundry.At first I was really confused. A couple of years before we found out my uncle raped women back then so my parents didnt allow me to visit my cousin because they were scared something might happen. But they didnt care that something actually happened. Now Ive come to terms with what happens at my best friends place but I still cant handle what happened with my mom. We talked about it again a few months ago and now she feels sorry and she probably just "misunderstood" it. Like wft? What is there to misunterstand when your daughter tells you some old man touched her private parts? I just cant forgive her but she doesnt seem to realize that or she simply doesnt care.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I think you should talk to a professional about it. I dont know if you suffer from depression but I feel like you might to. And thats ok. Depression doesnt need a reason. You dont need a "bad" life to have it. I used to think the same way since I was never really in a bad spot and a lot of people have it worse than me. Depression is an illness that everyone can get and sadly not everyone knows that. It helped me a lot talking to a therapist and made me realize that and thanks to that I dont feel as bad about it anymore as I used to. Also if you need someone to talk to I gladly listen to you. For me it was always easier to talk to someone whos not close to me and doesnt really know me so if I can help you this way Im happy to do so. Hope things are getting better for you soon.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>That happened to me to. I used to love drawing but just cant bring myself to do it anymore since it just isnt really enjoable anymore and it stresses me out that I cant do it anymore. What helped me against the tiredness is napping. With naps I feel less tired and can atleast somehow enjoy other things Im doing. What also helps me enjoy this more is playing games with friends since I cant enjoy games by myself anymore. Its more enjoyable if you hear your friends enjoy themselves when youre with them imo</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Maybe Im wrong here, im not an expert, but if its "only" black lives matter then what about other people? Shouldnt all lives matter? I mean I dont care what skin color you have. I get what they mean but why is all lives matter an inapropiate answer? This discussion could go on forever but I think if someone feels like thats inappropriate its kinda racist itself since youre excluding everyone but a specific group.

    <TEXT>Hey there, I just started playing this weekend and Im currently level 46. Right now my team is 3 star milk, 1 star black tea with the FA you got from the leveling and fondness once maxed out, 2 star red wine, 0 star peking duck and 0 star ddeobokki but also fondness once maxed out. I dont think any of the FA are really mentionable since I just started working on them. Other food souls I have that Im not sure of using are 3 star taiyaki and 2 star tempura and I dont know if I maybe should use him instead of ddeokbokki. I got some more 2 star rares, but no more super rares with stars other than black tea and red wine. As for ultra rare I got rum and dragons beard candy but they arent leveled or skilled at all since I just got them yesterday. Any advice appreciated. Maybe someone can even tell me what to look for when picking souls for my team. Thanks in advance!</TEXT>

I think I realized it when I was 14 and was more like an adult than him. Hes doing better now, he even admited he did something wrong today which is a huge progress and didnt even try to talk himself out of it. How it affected me emotionally and mentally? He totally destroyed my thicc skin and is the main reason for my severe depression and low selfesteem and self hatred.

You just have to watch out if the campaign if for your players levels and if the encounters are actually manageable. Our prewritten one wanted us to fight a fully grown red dragon on level 3. Not so fun but our DM changed it so its all good. You can also find a lot of the books as pdf online I think. I hope everything goes well!</TEXT>

    <TITLE>How do I F22 fix my relationship with my mom? Should I even try to fix it?</TITLE>
    <DATE>2020-07-08 11:19:50</DATE>
    <TEXT>Its been bothering me for years now and I just cant figure out a way how to fix our relationship. Or if I should even fix it. Its not that we are having a bad relationship or anything but she did quite some things in the past that hurt me a lot and it seems like I just cant forgive her. Now a little background. My parents were young when they had me. My mom was 20 and my dad was 21. They always say I was planned but not that early which already felt like I wasnt really wanted but thats not bothering me at all. My childhood was great, I felt loved and I didnt feel like anything was missing since I was their princess. 6 and a half years later my brother was born. He is disabled, physically amd mentaly and will never be able to look after himself. My mom knew her life was pretty much over since it was clear for her she had to devote her live to him. My parents still rather young where pretty overwhelmed with that so I stepped back and went from the lively energy ball who loved to make trouble to the quiet good girl that did as she was told. Imo I stepped back out of free will, my therapist says I was forced into it and then neglected but I dont think that way. Timeskip when I was like 8 or 9 years old. I got molested by a friends dad and it took me a couple of years to tell someone. I think I was 13 when I told my mom. I thought shed understand since they were really worried about me when they found out my uncle was a rapist a couple of years back so I was confident that she would comfort and help me. We sat down and I told her. All she said was "What do you want me to do?" in a way that felt like "why the f are you telling me this" and then she continued doing laundry. This still bothers me up until today. When I was 18 or something like that we were talking about the future and we talked about my brother. She said she didnt want him to live somewhere for disabled people called "supervised living" because people who live there get 'regularly' molested. It really struck me that she cared about him being molested but not me. Timeskip to earlier this year. I wanted to talk with her about it again. About how she reacted, why she cared about my brother being molested but not me. Her answer was there must have been a misunderstanding and that she must have gotten it wrong or something like that but it doesnt feel genuine. Ahe tries really hard to please me but it just doesnt feel real and I dont know how to fix it or if I should even fix it. I dont even care anymore about the part where I was molested the only thing that really hurts and wears me out mentally is her not caring. TL;DR: Told mom I was molested, didnt care. Years later worries about younger brother being molested. Talked with her again, said it was all just a misunderstanding but doesnt feel real or genuine. How can I and should I fix this relationship?</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I also borrowed my ex a lot of money when we moved out. He hardly could pay any back when we were together but I got it all afterwards. The way we did it was he gave me a little bit back each month, first we wanted to do 100 but when he was really low on money due to doctors bill I said its fine if we skip this month since I know he didnt just spend it. I dont know his financial status but I think it should be doable if he just saves money to give you it. Just sit down with him and talk about it. Sure you earn a lot but that doesnt mean you have to pay everything for him. Maybe try saying something along those lines just try telling him how you feel about it without hurting him. Im pretty sure he will understand it. Good luck!</TEXT>

I still have depression, but it got a lot better since I moved out and now can meet up with friends whenever I feel like it. Do you have a therapist?

    <TEXT>Where you live are you able to more or less live freely and do what you like? Or do you feel restricted in seeing your friends or doing activities you like. What I meant with me moving out is that when I lived with my parents is that I couldnt really meet up with friends since I couldnt stay out for too long. I also couldnt really do things I liked due to circumstances. Here psychologists are more or less only for medication. Therapists are the people you talk to. I used to see both but now I only visit my psychologist if I feel like I need it. I recommend both. They helped me a lot.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Ive been diagnosed with anxiety disorder and depression a couple of years ago. After I not enjoying anything anymore and being scared to go to work I talked to my normal doctor about it. He tried some mild medication first before sending me to a psychiatrist. He then diagnosed me and I visited him frequently until I got better last winter. Now I only visit him when I feel like I need to but Im still going to therapy (those are seperate here). Its really easy, just tell them how you feel and try to describe it as good as you can. I know it takes a lot to talk about it first but I think it really helps a lot. Hope things are getting better for you!</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I got diagnosed a couple of years ago. Things are getting better, but Im still suffering from it. My flat is a mess and I just cant manage to keep it clean. I have times where I dont enjoy anything and sometimes I stay in my bed for days. But those are getting less. I havent been able to work for over a year now but I finally managed to get some lessons thatll help me get a job later on. Im starting tomorrow and I know it will be hard. But looking back, Ive managed worse. I dont really have any close family that keeps me from ending it all. I just have this one best friend I dont want to leave behind and Im sure things will work eventually and there will be a time Ill get to be happy (again?). When I was younger I wanted to end it all a lot of times but I always told myself that I dont deserve to just go. I deserve the suffering. I know its not healthy to think this way but those thoughts kept me alive until I found my best friend so Im glad I had them. Now I wanna get stronger for her and keep going, knowing we will have more and more fun times where we enjoy ourselves and I cant wait to get there.</TEXT>

People often think (me included) that relationships with a bigger agegap were initiated by the older one and so "seduced" the younger one (Im just leaving the gold digger aspect out since that isnt the case). Maybe shes just worried about you and thinks you got into something you originally didnt want and worries about you. Maybe shell understand.

    <TEXT>Imo it is. The first one i had was also really alternative. She war really nice but I just didnt feel like anything was changing. It took me quite some time until I could mention this and got a new therapist. With therapy its really important that you feel comfortable with them and changing them shouldnt be a problem if thinks just dont work between you. The one I have now is really nice and I can talk to her about anything. Just last timewe talked about the wage gap and inequality between men and women. It had nothing to do with my problems or anything we were just having a nice talk with each other and I really enjoy the time I get to spend with her. I would really recommend getting one and looking for the right one because things can only change for the better if you feel comfortable with your therapist and trust him/her.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Im very sorry for your loss. I remember when my greatgrandma and cousin died when I was in primary school. I couldnt cope with it until I think I was 20. It might not be the same as yours but I felt really sad and guilty since my parents went to visit my granny the evening before she passed but I wanted to stay home play games on my new DS. The next day she was found dead. Almost the same with my cousin. She was in hospital due to something rather minor and I had a long school day and just wanted to play some games and relax planning on visiting her tomorrow. She died the same night. I was 15 at that time. What helped me was my therapist. Im in therapy due to depression and one day it came up and after a lot of talking I felt better. I know it cant be compared but maybe talking about it will help. I recommend a therapist if just talking to a friend or something wont help if its something that sits deeper. Maybe theres also some regret that you have amd thats the reason why you cant let go. It helped me but again Im not sure if you can compare this since the bond to a sibling is deeper than the relationship I had to them. I hope youre feeling better soon.</TEXT>

We both did our fair share of damage and I guess I got what I deserve from him aswell. I want to change now so this wont happen again. I dont want to hurt anybody but as I am now I will continuing hurting people if I am in a relationship and maybe try to work things out between us in the future. A couple of weeks ago I even sent him and a flatmate of his amessage to be careful since a psycho who burnt down his own house (was my former neighbour) just moved in a flat above them.

When Im having the flu and I can barely hold something in my doc said I could try some sips of empty soup or some fruit juicy with a lot of water so I get some salt and stuff and dont feel so miserable.

    <TEXT>I worked for a fairly well known bakery here. One of the richest people here too btw. And how things worked there were disgusting. People went outside in the rain and stuff with their workshoes which are supposed to be only worn indoors and then use the dough that fell on the floor they threw at each other. Sometimes they sniped bugs with the nutfilling and just left it there. Once our boss brought 20kg of fat from his family vacation and told us to use it to cook breakfast instead of the olive oil we normally used. It was disgusting and smelly but we had to use it. We used the old cheese and ham from sandwiches that didnt sell for breakfast too like scrambled egg ect. It was full of joghurtsauce and dry and didnt look good at all. I used to like the stuff they sold a lot until I worked there. Now I feel like throwing up everytime someone offers me something from that well known place that people really love for some reason.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I loved playing the old Yorick but the new one isnt fun for me. I cant really tell you why he just doesnt feel right to me. I also really liked the old Soraka but I think the rework was good and needed since giving someone mana just seems op. Although I hate playing against her I think they did a good job with her rework. Hardly played the old Ashe since she seemed hard because I didnt know when to use her Q but I love the new one. Shes really fun although I suck at her. Annie didnt really get a rework but I liked hee better before the changes. I think the speedboost on her E isnt really needed but I have no problem with it. I also dont like the bar that shows your stacks since you cant "outplay" your enemy as hard as you could back then but I guess its only fair to add it. For Kayle Im not too sure. I liked the old one and I like the new one. With the old one it bothered me that you always had to use E to be ranged which is fixed with the new Kayle but I dont like that you cant attack with the new one while ulting. I guess both are fine for me although I would love to see the old ult on the new one I guess. I cant think of any other champ that got a rework that I really play so thats it for me.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Asure him youre there for him. It takes a lot to talk to your loved one about it. For me it was because I was embarrassed and I feared them leaving be because I was weird. If possible dont try to stare at the marks he has as it can make one feel even worse and thus continuing the circle. I would recommend talking to him about his mental health and seeing a doctor if you think hes up for it. Some people dont take that too well and since I believe you know your husband pretty good I think you know if you can bring it up or if hes too uncomfortable to talk to a professional because people might look down on him or something. I didnt like talking about it with my partner as they seemed to pitty me making things harder on me. Sadly I dont have a solution for your problem since I couldnt even solve it myself when I was in his position. Itll probably take quite some time but I think itll help if you support him in other ways and again make sure he knows youre there for him and that he can trust you with anything. I rather talked to my therapist about it but then again I dont know if thats an option for your husband. Maybe get some bandaids and stuff to treat the wounds for him and leaving then where you know he will find them if he needs them. It shows that you care about him although he does that. At least thats what I wished for. I hope things get better for the two of you and that you can find a proper way to communicate about his problems someday. I wish you the best.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I went there because if I didnt I knew I kill myself. There were some really kind nurses and it really felt like they want to help you but the one that was looking after me didnt really care. We talked about different therapies and I said Im really uncomfotable with big groups and I hate doing exercise in front of other people because I feel judged and stuff like that. He probably wasnt listening or didnt care and said hed sign me up for something like dancing therapy and I couldnt even say anything. Im glad I could talk about it do a doctor that I cant do that and that was no problem and so I got into something like a small yoga group, music, crafting and some light sports therapies. Overall I think it can really help but for me it just didnt feel right. Since I went there by myself I could leave when I wanted about 2.5 weeks after I got there. The medication sure helped a lot when I was there but when I got home they switched the dosis which lead to huge sleeping problems and me needing sleeping pills. A few months later I dropped the medication since I felt like a zombie and got something more natural which worked better for me. I dont know how it works in other countries but here in austria I think its going pretty well and if you need help and you ask for it you will get it. At least thats my experience.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>When I was in primary school my best friends dad slipped his hand up my long pants and touched me. I couldnt say anything and just pretended to move in my sleep which made him stop. After what feld forever I still couldnt sleepcagain and woke my friend up, telling her I had a stomach ache. We slept in her parents bed and her dad then usually slept in hers and since her mother worked that night her dad came and came next to me, slipped his hand again in my pants and asked me if it hurts there. I instantly said no and after a few seconds that felt like forever again he removed it. He then decided to sleep between us and I just couldnt sleep anymore. It was only 4am at that time. They fell asleep again and nothing more happened and as soon as it was 6am I just left there going home in the snow and waited in front of our frontdoor until someone at home was awake. Today Im not really affected by it anymore I just panic if someone touches my feet since I remember but that can be avoided. What still bothers me though is that my mom didnt care when I told her a couple of years later. I talked about it with her earlier this year again and she said it was a missunderstanding and that shes sorry but I just cant get myself to believe her and it really ruined my relationship with her but the fact that I was harassed doesnt bother me anymore.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>My physics teacher. He didnt let me fail class because he saw I tried hard during lessons and was just really bad with tests. He also created a DnD group for those interested in our class, supplying us with everything needed. Later then he even made it a subject where all students could join if they wanted to. He also let us paint his warhammer figurines for free and again supplying us with everything. He also let my buy his manga stash for one buck per manga. I really hated school and it was a horrible time for me but sometimes I wish I could go back just to experiemce the joy again that he brought to us. When he was our DM he acted so damn good and it made the whole experience even better. Just imagine a late 20ies nerd teacher playing a tiny fairy with a horribly high pitched voice. It was hilarious.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>My mom didnt care when I told her someone molested me in primary school. Years later she worried about my brother getting molested in front of me. We talked about it again earlier this year and she said it was all just an missunderstanding but it doesnt feel genuine or real at all. Besides that they never gave me the feeling of being important or needed as anything other than a live in babysitter.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Ive seen many people sending hearts to close friends as well as to their SO. I personally dont really use it which doesnt mean I dont like or love the other person I just show my affection in other ways. I suggest you dont think so hard about it and just go with what feels right to you. If it doesnt feel right or awkward maybe just tell her about it as people might think somethings wrong if they suddenly stop using them. I dont think thatll be a problem.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Its from austria. You just make some spaetzle which are really easy to make and then either warm them up with lots of cheese in a pan or bake them in the oven so you get a crust. Here we have cheese with real strong taste but you can also use mild cheese if thats what you prefer. When we make it in a pan we also use some of the water from the spaetzle to make it more creamy but thats personal preference.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Im sorry for what youve experienced that made you feel this way. I also often think about just not excisting in the first place so I can relate. But really. The way it is written really moved me and I think you have talent. It was sad but somehow really beautiful to me. This might mean nothing to you but I wanted to let you know anyway since you might not be aware of your talent. Is writing a hobby of yours or do you do it as a job? I really love the way it was written and I want to read more of it. Sure, it makes me feel sad but its a good kind of sad I think. Maybe its sad because of how beautiful and relatable it is to me. Anyway, thank you for sharing and I hope thing will get better for you. You deserve it and Im hoping the best for you!</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I would leave my bf back then because I know hell leave me as soon as Im going to the hospital. I wont let this dude catfish me again, dont start working at this horrible company and wont get into that toxic relationship again. Id save money by not having it so even if some thing turned out the same way I would be financially stable and wouldnt have to worry about money. I also wouldnt have lost as many things because I wouldnt move 3 times in one year and instead pack my stuff myself and not get thrown out because of jealousy. I wouldnt get involved with a bunch of people and if possible cut of my ties with my mom. I also wouldnt but cosplay stuff for a con in fucking march 2020 and save myself and my best friend some money.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I already quit social media and whatsapp twice before. The reason was my depression. I felt really pressured by being available at all times and people knowing when Im online and then eventually pressure me into answering when Im not really ready to do that. Part of it also came from my bosses since they just used to text me whenever they needed someone. I think they always asked me because they knew I couldnt say no. I got rid of every thing and was only available per SMS and phone call. I did that for a couple of months until I felt better but even now I try to avoid opening it and dont answer everyone the moment I get their message so they get used to it I guess. I dont really know how to describe it. Sure, some are really useful if I want to share things with my friends but I often with for the old days to come back where you didnt have to be available all the time and people couldnt check on your activities. Its a curse and a blessing but imo its more of a curse. Ive been using whatsapp again for almost a year again and social media since the beginning of the year. Well, I have social media installed but only check it a few times a month.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I dont think them liking anime makes them more likly to have an xbox. I mean if you like the games kn that console you get it but I dont think anime got anything to do with it. Also just because you like animr doesnt mean you have to play "anime games". I have to say I love anime and manga but I hardly play any games that I would consider anime games. Also if you think about how popular it is by now then the numbers arent as surprising as you thought they were. I also know someone who makes his profile in anime style just so when people look him up because they lost they get triggered because they lost to a weeb. Not sure why or how that should work but apperantly there are people like that too.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I often hear that your rank has nothing to do with your normal MMR. I dont know if its true but I get the feeling it is. When I play normals with my friend who is silver and Im always unranked until the season ends and then hurry my ass up to gold for the skin we often have diamond players in our game. Yes it feels unfair but thats just how league of legends works. I have a friend that started playing around a year ago and he had the same problem although when we played with him we used low level accounts so the match up wouldnt be as unfair for him. I think as soon as youre almost lvl 30 riot doesnt give a shit about levels and just matches you with whoever is 30+. I already had people in my game whose level was 5 times as high as mine on my main account. Sure it can tilt you but in the end its just a normal. I get that it sucks to be stomped pretty hard and I hate it too but stuff like that just happens. I try to think of it as a game where I can try out new stuff or just have fun with a friend. For example rn we are leveling new accounts and shes not that good at csing so we give each other cs goals like 80 at 10min and if you cant do it you get a penalty. Also using different unusual builds to get better at it under different conditions. Sure we might lose the game because we are so focused on it but we also learn from it and again its just a normal game where you dont lose anything. Sorry for the wall of text. Got kinda carried away.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Im sorry for what youve been through. I might not be able to help you with my personal experience since Im still young but I know how it worked with my parents. They got togetherwhen my mom was 16 and my dad was 17. They married around 19ish and had me with 20/21. Soon after they got a divorce but were still friends. Things just didnt work out at that time. Not too long after that they came together again and married again in 2003 and still are today. Today they are 43 and 44 and they seem happy but from what I can tell you is that over the years I lived with them my father didnt change. When we argued he never saw his wrong doings and stuff like that which bothered me but not my mom. She could accept him how he was and said thats just how he is. I moved out a year ago and to be honest I want to think people can change if they really want but from my experience I have to say it takes a LOT of time. He started showing signs that hes starting to change now but thats only after all those years. It took him over 20 years to finally start. I dont want to say that its possible but I heard my parents arguing about it over and over again from time to time so Im pretty sure it was a problem in their relationship. So to your question do people change: Yes, I believe they do but it takes a lot of time. At least from what Ive experienced.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Does it really matter what others think of his appearance? They dont have to date him or be with him so I dont think its relevant. If she knew him and his character in person that would be something else but only based on insta pics...I dont know about you but I wouldnt worry to much. For an example my best friend and I prefer completly different types of guys. And thats ok. I even think its great that our taste doesnt match so we dont have to worry about having a crush on the same guy.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>People dont want other people to first time in their rankeds which I think is understandable. When you first play a champ youll probably play worse than your actual skill level. Sure it sucks if a team mate banns a preselected champ from his own team mate but I also understand it. Or maybe they fear the enemy first picking him and themselves not being able to do well against him which is also quite possible to happen. There are people who take ranked really seriously amd want their team to do the same so maybe they expect them to not play Yone, a champ with which they most liklely have no to hardly amy experience. Id say just take a break from ranked until things get better with the new champ but some people only play ranked or whatever. Im not defending anyone here. Im just trying to explain what reasons there could be based on my feelings about ranked.</TEXT>

My mom is looking after him right now and hardly has any free time, cant go to work or meet up with friends because for everything shed need a babysitter. No way Im doing this.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I always wanted a huge family growing up. But when I was 18 I got really sick and this can come back at any time and they dont really know how to treat it since its super rare. I dont know if my kids will get it and I dont want to ask the doctors since I dont trust them when they cant even tell me exactly what will be going on with me in the future. I simply dont eant to risk it at any cost. I just dont want them to go through the shit Ive been through. I also dont want them to maybe suffer from depression like I and a lot of my family members did so I just tell myself I dont want any anymore. It really hurt in the beginning but years later Ive come to accept it.</TEXT>

I also once happend to find a manga in a shop I really enjoyed but couldnt find online. Had to wait for years to finish it but it was worth it. I read all 17 volumes at least 3 times already.</TEXT>

I think I even could start farming them earlier since I already had one on S while the second highest was on only B I think. Maybe not just give them to us but dont continue to increase the amount of points you need to get it. Or atleast get us a little boost so its easier.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I mean I get that people want more to grind. I used to be one of them. But I was always happy just grinding tokens because of how much you get from them. I think the missions and stuff like that should also be doable for people who dont play an insane amount imo. I dont play that much with 120 games since the event started but I know people who dont even have that much time but would love to get it but think it just wouldnt be worth it for them. Like I said, I understand that people want more to grind but isnt it enough that you get more tokens for playing more which are worth a lot just like you said before?</TEXT>

    <TEXT>For me its a place where I can say anything and she helps me reflection on everything making me realize that not everything was my fault and that my upbringing wasnt normal. I always thought Im just weak and sensitive and that I should just get over it. Its kinda scary how I can tell her stuff and then she describes feelings that I never told anyone about but are locked in so deep down and everything just comes out. To be honest it is a bit scary but its a great relieve for me and it makes me realize a lot of things. But it takes time to find the right therapist and its ok to change them if you dont feel like you match. Im always really exhausted afterwards but for me it is 100% worth it.</TEXT>

Its easter ham, horseraddish, eggs, different kinds of sausages to put on your bread too. We usually eat it with rye bread or a sweet one with honey and cinnamon and if you want raisins in it. It sounds weird with the sweet bread but I swear its delicious as fuck.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Cant cut ties yet but I will as soon as I can. They never actually cared about me and only ever treated me as a live in babysitter. When I told my mom I was molested she didnt care but would worry about my brother being molested infront of me. Theyre not bad parents per s #233;. They never hit me or abused me but I dont feel any love coming from them. It all feels fake. Like they want people to know they are good parents because they are supportive of their depressed daughter but dont actually care at all.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Im in a similar situation.I was in a toxic relationship and now want to focus on myself and getting better before starting a new one. A friend of mine told me he fell in love woth me and we talked things through. Nothing happened in the beginning but whenever he drank something he would start talking about it again. It made me feel really uncomfortable and put a lot of pressure on me so I had to tell him to either stop talking about it since we both already agreed that we talked about it and theres nothingleft to say about this topic or I have to cut ties until he knows he wont mention it again. It really drained me mentally and weve been on a breal for about 2 months now. We hardly talk now and dont really hang out so things are easier on him. I dont know how it is for her but for me it was horrible that he kept asking. I feld pressured and really bad for turning him down although theres nothing I can do for him to change that. I strongly recommend not pressuring her and try to just behave like you did before. I know its hard but shell tell you when shes ready. If you want to wait thats nice but if you find someone else in the meantime thats totally fine too.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Some time ago I watched something where an amerocan guy from a talkshow I think went and visited a german prison. He talked with a prisoner who had a pretty nice room with a table and chairs and so on in it. He asked the prisoner "Did you ever think about using a table leg as a weapon?" andthe prisoner looked at him in total confusion and was like "No, I never thought about that. Why would I?" Sure, severe crimes need to be punished but I also think its really important to help those people to get back into society and be a part of it again. If you treat them like shit in there and after they come out its no wonder theyll do it again. But if you help those people in prision change and getting their life together most of them wont to it again.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I started to do shooting as a sport when I was 14 or so. I was the worst but for the first time I didnt care because I was really enjoying it. I joined a club for that since I couldnt do it at home and the people were all really nice and I had lots of fun. My dad then said I have to participate in competitions which I hated since I went there and only got like half the points the other people my age got since everyone was doing it since they were little. I didnt want to do it anymore since it ruined the fun for me to only go somewhere and lose by a lot. I did improve but I would never get as good as the ones who startet almost 10 years ahead of me so I quit since my dad didnt want me to be part of the club anymore if I dont do the competitions. Im still sad about it since I had my own gun and everything and I really enjoyed it just to have it ruined by him. I would love to start again but I dont have the money to buy a new one since we sold my old one and Im too old now to borrow one from the club. A couple of years after that I also got depression and stopped drawing which I also really like but I just cant get myself to do it anymore.</TEXT>

Maybe they are having a hard time realizing and accepting that. They shouldnt have any say anymore who you hang out with and who your friends are, especially if you love alone now and support yourself. Maybe talking with them about it will make things easier on you.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I dont know if that counts but a friend of mine wanted to talk about something he heard from another person. Due to something that happened earlier this year it was extremly uncomfortable to spend time with him so I wanted to know what its about to see if we can solve it without actually meeting up. He wouldnt tell me so I said as long as he cant tell me whats up Im not coming over to talk about it. The thing that happened earlier this year really stresses me out and makes me really uncomfortable to spend time with him so we were on some kind of break and we were both ok with that. And since he just didnt want to tell me what it is and since it was such a big thing for him that he said that it depends if we could continue being friends or not based on how things worked out on this I was like "If its that important just tell me whats it about now and then I can come over" but he refused. So now were not friends anymore because of something someone said and he just wouldnt tell me.</TEXT>

I already struggle with anxiety disorder and it drove me crazy so we decided to take a break until he could keep it to himself. To be fair he only brought it up when he was drinking but has a small alcohol problem so it came up quite often. Hes working on it and things got better but still not good enough for us to meet up.

    <TEXT>If you can talk to your doctor about it. I felt pretty similar and when I first talked to my mom about it she just brushed it off and said sometimes thats how it is. Months later I talked about it again and said I want to talk to my doctor about it and I got diagnosed with depression. Im not saying you have depression but it showed in a similar way for me and thats why I think you should bring it up to a doctor. I got to try some pretty weak medication before being sent to a psychiatrist because sometimes thats enough for people. I know it can take quite a lot to talk about it and you might be ashamed or feel bad but theres no need to. Depression is something most people go through at some point in their life be it diagnosed or undiagnosed. But if its affecting your life too much you should get it looked at and see if it might be the case just to make your life a little bit easier. Its nothing to be ashamed of and its completly normal. It only could get dangerous if you do nothing about it and let it take control of your life.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I think they will. Why? I take the lunar revel event as example. The event itself was only once until now but it included skins from prior lunar events before they were like this including borders and chromas for older skins. We have a lot of skin series in league already but I think if there will be another addition to a skin series with an event there might be a chance that we also get the stuff that was available for the older skins. I have no prove and thats only how I think it could (and hopefully will) work since they kinda already did it. Same with the winter skins. They also got (rather ugly) chromas later on in an event if i remember correctly.</TEXT>

I never could handle it and over the 20 years I lived with them I talked a lot about it with him and he also said he would try to change but it never got better. What I want to say with that is that chances are hell never change. Now ask yourself: Are you fine with that continuing like this or do you want something better (which you deserve)?</TEXT>

    <TEXT>This reminds me of my time back in high school. I wasnt really popular but I got along with everyone and had a couple of what I would consider close friends and a boyfriend. They all left me when I was 18 and really sick and I was asking myself the same question. After a few years of feeling horrible because I must be a bad person if everyone leaves me I started therapie and it really helped me. Im not only seeing the fault in myself anymore and Ive come to terms with it. By now I dont have that many friends as I had back then but the ones I have are really close and I know they wont leave me. I think you just havent found the right people yet. To me you dont seem like a bad person because you dont blame them, you look at yourself and whats wrong which can be a good thing if its not always. You cant please everyone and it took me a long time to find that out myself and also live like that. Sure, its sad and frustrating to be alone but it will get better. I know it. Give it some time, maybe focus on doing things you like for now and maybe you get to know new potential friends while doing so. I hope things go well for you!</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Maybe youd enjoy Zed. Hes an assassin and I guess hes kinda easy to play but pretty hard to master. Also Talon and maybe even Yasuo and Yone might be interesting. If you want to try out jungle there are Kha Zix and Rengar who can oneshot pretty much anyone besides tanks. Those are all AD champs. For mage assassins there is Diana whos really strong and I think she can be played mid and also jungle (not too sure about that, I dont really jungle) and Fizz whos really annoying to play against. If you want to scale into lategame Kassadin might also be interesting since hes REALLY strong once hes farmed up and has his items (thus Kassawin). Akali is also great pick and I think her champ design fits the assassin role the best. Theres also Katarina. I dont really see her that often but shes really strong if played correctly since she gets cooldownresets on kills and assists. There are even more but thats all I can think of right now. If you want to know more about them feel free to ask me here or dm me.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I think there are tons of videos on youtube but youll learn most by playing with better players. Farming is important since it means more gold which results in more items and more damage. Lane trading and knowing what the enemy champion does also helps a lot. It might not be everyones piece of cake but I recommend playing Aram to get to know champions since you get to play a huge variety of champions and also play against them as in normals you usually stick to the same pattern of champs you pick and the other people usually play whats good at the moment so you tend so see more or less the same champions over and over again. Also vision is key. Knowing where the enemy is beforehand is really helpful and a lot of people dont care about it since they think its the supports job. Get vision wards if you have some leftover gold and have some space. Maybe you have some friends who play with you and show you some good spots to ward or something like that. If you dont have anyone to play with you can join me and my friends sometimes if you want. Also if youre not tiltprove and teammates easily tilt you use mute all. It helps a lot and people hardly say anything useful in chat anyway.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Thats not really true. The price depends on how old the champ is. Thats also why the prices drop in the order they were released. Sure, some of them are simple but thats not something to go by.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Lets take Braum (6800) and Anivia (3150). I think we can all agree that Anivia is harder than Braum. Its just nothing to go by anymore. Sure, new champions can have complexer kits and stuff like that but that doesnt mean that newer and therefor more expensive champs are harder. Or Akali. Rather hard to master Id say but also one of the cheaper champions. I dont have all prices memorized but there are a lot of non 6800 champs that are really hard.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Told my mom years ago about me beinh molested and she didnt care. Now the topic came up again and shes acting all surprised while saying "It must have been a missunderstanding" when I told her he put his hands into my pants between my legs. Not too long before that she worried that my brother might get molested and because of that she would look after him for the rest of her life (hes disabled). And thus I think its obvious that her saying she cares about me as much as she cares about my brother and also loving me is a lie.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>What helped me to improve: download a shitton of maps (got almost all ranked maps), sort by difficulty, go to the folder that fits my skill (currently 5 stars), press F2 and play the map it lands on. Repeat infinite times. When I started playing I used to play only maps where I really enjoyed the song to so I kept playing the same maps over and over again wothout really impoving much. With the random method I got to play different types of maps from different people which went from short PP maps like Harumachi Clover to pretty long maps with like 7min. I used to play a lot of anime openings so my stamina was pretty shit but now its kinda decent I guess? But the most important thing you shouldnt forget: have fun playing it. Rank isnt everything.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Im sorry if this sounds rude but are you on medication for your depression? If so I would stop or at least reduce your input of weed. I know this might sound hard and I used to be high every single day too about a year ago when I was on medication and sure while being stoned I felt better but afterwards things always got worse for me. My anxiety would trigger mote often and sometimes even paranoia which is caused by the mix of weed and medication you get for example depression. I stopped smoking everyday about a year ago and it helped me a lot. Im less anxious and feel even better if I do smoke. I know this wont solve a lot of problems and Im really sorry that I cant give you any advise on it but at least thats something I know could help.

    <TEXT>I guess you could say I was bullied by my dad. He never really meant it and to be honest the first couple of years it didnt get to me and I would just talk back which was also no problem for him. When I got 11 I started to take things seriously. What if he really meant it? Am I really so dumb and stuff like that? I started talking about it when I was 13 I think after I got my period and he would shittalk me about that. He said its fine and he would stop but a couple of days later things were back how they were before. This went on until I was 16 were I just gave up talking to him. I got tired of building up the courage talking to him about it just to be let down a couple of days later. When I was a child I had tons of selfesteem and wouldnt let things get to me easily but after years of hard work done by my dad it got destroyed eventually and since then Im really selfcautious and I also began hating myself. Im 22 now and moved out by now and I have to say things got better with him since Im not living with them anymore. But the damage is already done. When I was 18 my selfhatred was that huge that I felt like I need to punish myself for everything so I started selfharm. Now Im also depressed which my therapist things comes from the relationship with my father along with other stuff that was going on back then. Im still struggling and have no feelings of love or the like for myself left. But Im working on it and I hope one day I can get my selfesteem back and things will be alright again.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Im sorry for what youre going through. I dont really have any advice on what to do about the step mom part but looking back when I was a child I also loved it when my mom did my hair. What you could do is on weekends or evenings after work, go on youtube with her and trying out new hairstyles with her. So you could get some practice and have some fun with her. When my mom wasnt there my dad would do it and although the outcome was more or less hilarious we still had fun. Maybe thats something to distract her and also helps you and her getting stuff like that done together. About the period problem maybe you could ask your mom or if you have your sister if you feel uncomfortable with it or just need some information. For me it was always hard to talk to my dad about it so it might be easier for her when its time for it. I know its not a lot but thats about all I can help you with. I hope things get better soon for you two!</TEXT>

    <TEXT>My ex didnt want me to make friends online too. For me it was really horrible since gaming is my favourite hobby and I had noone to play games with. In the beginning he used to play with me a lot so I had no need for it but later on he didnt want to anymore so I wanted to get some online since I had noone else to play with. He got furious over me making friends online simply to have someone to play games with when he wasnt around or was doing something else since he refused to play anything with me. It all turned into a huge fight which caused him to break up with me. Because I wanted to make friends. Because I didnt have any back them besides him and my best friend who wasnt into gaming. I hope you can trust her to use it properly. You might feel uncomfortable but lets look at it from the other perspective. Maybe shes lonley and just wants to talk to someone when youre not around or when youre doing something with your friends. Maybe not all your hobbies are shared and she wants someome to share it with? Just because people use it as a dating app doesnt mean she will.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Just because you didnt have a tragic upbringing or something like that doesnt mean you cant have depression. To be honest I first thought so too. My life wasnt bad but I still got depression. After 3 years of therapy I know more or less know what caused it and to be honest it helped a lot. Maybe you just dont realize it yet but there might be something that just seems normal to you that caused it. Thats how it was to me. If youre up for it try talking to a therapist. Make sure you get one where you feel comfortable. Switching therapists isnt bad. You have to find the one that works for you and thats just as important as getting therapy itself. I hope this helps you a bit and I hope yoire getting better soon. Stay strong!</TEXT>

Would it be enough for you to just see each other once a year like you see your friend now if you cant increase the times you visit? Ldr's are really hard especially if you only see each other only once a year. Im not saying its impossible but just think about all this stuff before telling her how you feel.

    <DATE>2020-09-19 20:35:04</DATE>
    <TEXT>So Im struggling from depression and anxiety disorder for quite a while now and recently Ive been feeling good. About a year ago I picked up smoking to handle my anxiety and it worked quite well since I hardly selfharmed since then. Now I wanted to stop smoking which is no problem per s #233; but my neighbours are a couple that separated about 2 months ago but are now together again. They fight a lot which triggered my anxiety since I had a toxic relationship before which sounded pretty much like their fights do. I go out everytime I hear them but I just get so shaken that I need SOMETHING, be it a cig or selfharm. I dont need to smoke any other time of the day, only when I get triggered by them. Has anyone some advice or gone through something similar? Anything would be a huge help.</TEXT>

Imagine everyone liking the same thing. It would just be boring. Sure hating something for the meme is fun but just let people enjoy the things they like.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Maybe the way you told him was a bit harsh. You could sit down with him and talk about it properly in a non insulting way. Maybe he was already insecure about it and just tried to brush it off and then you mentioned it. Maybe he just likes the way it looks. By talking to him you can both be honest with each other and maybe find a way that works for both of you.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I argee with you that her wording wasnt the best but that doesnt mean shes a shitty person imo. I dont think she wanted to be rude and hurt him and it is a problem that should be adresses if its causing problems in the relationship. The way she did it might not be the right one but she is allowed to bring it up. If it was my partner I would like him to tell me if I was turing into someone hes not attracted to anymore. But in a nice way. Not only to maybe feel more comfortable myself but also to be able to stay with him. Maybe not everyone sees it this way but Id say that theres nothing wrong with that.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I think I can relate to how youre feeling right now. When I first talked to my mom about me having depression (not having fun no matter what I do for over half a year, not getting out of bed in the morning, small things like doing the dishes seemed like a whole mountain of work, really anxious about work and getting really unwell just thinking about goimg etc.) she brushed it off as "everyone has those kind of days". The only thing I can tell you is to a) talk to your normal doc about it. He should have some basic knowledge about it and if he thinks there is something he can send you to a professional or b) try again and show her how urgent it is. I tried the second one and for me it worked. Not really as well as I liked it but it kinda did. Try to tell her exactly how you feel and why you think its important to see a professional. If you need to exaggerate a bit when talking to her but be 100% honest with the doctor. I know its hard talking about it again after beeing shut down once but I know you can do it. Maybe tell her how the schools isnt really trained for stuff like that and that you feel like youre not getting the treatment you need from them. I know you can do it and I believe in you! I wish you well and good luck talking to them!</TEXT>

The guys who did this had to spend every break at the teachers office for the rest of the school year and were always escorted by a teacher from and to class. That was in spring so they had no breaks for half a school year. Didnt even get expelled.</TEXT>

To be honest it took me quite some time to be honest and tell my partner I like it. For some reason I felt really slutty for liking it so with my first I think 2 bfs I didnt really tell them and only did it if hinted or asked for it. I dont know what made me feel that way or changed but maybe I got more confident in doing it because I recieved very positive feedback.

    <TEXT>Growing up my parents always told me Im lazy, selfish and always let them spoil me. Of course I believed that after years of hearing that and I was convinced its true until a little bit ago. My bf came over and we dont see each other too often. He got a bit sick while staying here so I did everything I could to help him get better. Let him sleep on the bed while im on the sofa so I dont wake him up in the morning when I had to leave, cook him chicken soup and anything else he likes, bring him anything he asks for. That already surprised me after realizing what I did. After all Im still a lazy and selfish girl in my head. But I also did this all while running a fever. I never thought I would be able to do something like that, not only because I believed what my parents said was true but also because Im usually pretty plaintive and my depression makes things only worse. Im really proud of myself. It isnt much but Im glad finally can accept that my parents werent right and prove to myself that Im not just a bad person.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>When I was younger my mother took me to a shaman. I dont know why she brought me there but it was probably because I had some problems or whatever and since she went there regularly with my disabled brother she took me there too. She did her stuff and felt that a presence or something like that stuck to me and asked if someone died recently in our family or maybe someone else who was close. Noone did the only person that died was my great grandma about 6 or 7 years ago. She asked her name and continued. She then asked for the name a couple of times again until she said shes always getting a weird name from that presence and thats why shes asking over and over again. My great grandmas name was Elizabeth. She told my mom the weird name she always got and my mom was shocked. It was a stupid nickname she was called when she was young that has nothing to do with her actual name so theres actually no way she could have guessed that right without knowing. I didnt know that name because that was from before my time but the look on my moms face said it all. She said shes still stuck with me because shes worried because I blame myself. I really did but never told anyone about it. I missed the last time I could see her because I rather played video games than going meet her. She died the same night and I blamed myself since then. I dont know how she did it but something had to be going on Im 100% sure of it.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>When do you want kids? Can you afford a child and give it the life it deserves? Maybe talk about this with your SO when youre both calm and have plenty of time. Maybe shes in a hurry to have kids because she thinks youll drag it out for a long time and thats what causes her to be uneasy. I dont know when youre ready but lets just say you tell her you want to settle into your job and save some money first and you would rather wait like 3 years or so maybe it calms her down. From my perspective having kids early like in your 20s is not bad because I always think when your child is 10ish or so you can still play with them outside because youre still young too and can move around freely compared to when youre in your 30s when you have your first child. Youll then be in your 40s and maybe you already have some smaller health issues that limit your ability to roam around with it like problems with your back and so on. But that does not mean its ok for her doing this. Youre still really young and have time so Id talk to her about it, saying you need a bit more time and if you already know, tell her when that might be so she can calm down. Do you know why shes in a hurry? Maybe some health conditions run in her family she never told you about which make her feel the need to have kids right here and now. If you cant talk to her about it properly maybe try a couple therapist or something like that.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>When I was 18 I had a pretty similar experience. I know its hard but you have to stay strong. I think its better for you to not be with him anymore. It seems like he didnt value the relationship as much as you did. I remember beeing all alone too since his friends became mine and after we broke up I had noone left in my life since they all "sided" with him since they were friends for a long time while I only knew them for about 2 years. Do you have any hobbies you can focus on to distract yourself or a way you can get to know new people? For me I focused on gaming with strangers online of which some became friends and I also used food as comfort which helped at the moment. If you can stay away from alcohol. It wont do you any good and might just make things worse. Its going to be a hard time but youll get through it, I just know you can. As for your period, I also have terrible pain and got really strong painkillers years ago until my gynecologist told me I could just take birthcontrol without the breaks so I dont have my period anymore which also helped me a lot at that time and also in my life in general. Often I was in so much pain I was close to passing out so I think I can relate a little bit. If you need someone to talk to or just someone who listens to you ranting I gladly lend you my ear. I might not give the best advice but since Ive been through something very similar maybe I can help just a bit.</TEXT>

The only side effect I felt was that I gained a little weight and that by breast grew a little bit but I guess the second one is not too bad. The pill Im taking has a pretty light dosage so I guess the side effects arent that noticable.

    <TEXT>The group Im currently in also has mainly new people. Only our DM and I have prior exerience but its our Dms first time being the DM. We also had some really tilting moments in the game but while playing we dont say anything. After were finished we always give feedback to the DM. What we liked, what we disliked and maybe ideas we have for the future. Maybe thats something you could do too. I think it helps a lot to hear what people think and noone takes things personally since we make clear that its just our oppinion. Maybe you could do a one shot for the group if they want to see you DM. That would also be a great time to let your DM try out being a player. Maybe things will get better if you talk about each indiviual session afterwards and he gets a better feeling how it is to be a player.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I started my drivers licence when I was 16. My parents urged me to do it since I had no job over the summer and they said they would like a little help with shopping ect. since my brother is disabled. I live in austria so I had to drive 3k km to get the drivers licence with 17 and to be honest Im really glad I had to. Starting it I was really anxious as well and my hands got so sweaty I had a hard time to get a grip on the steering wheel. I dont know about germany but cant you get a "L Tafel" where you can drive with your parents while doing your licence? It took me quite some time to get used to it but I think half way through it got better. Maybe you could ask your dad if you could practice somewhere quiet where hardly anyone drives? I think hell understand since just starting to drive can be quite scary especially if you suffer from anxiety. I didnt want to do it in the first place but now Im glad I did. Sure you can get almost anywhere with public transport but once you have it, you can still use it or sometimes take the care if its late which Im really happy about. If you want you can message me. I know how hard it is since I suffer from anxiety and depression aswell. Hope things turn out well for you. Good luck.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>What helped me with that although it seemed really stupid is before my first driving lesson my teacher had to make a call. He told me to go through them 1 to 5 and back until he finished. At first in my head I was like "Thats stupid, I know where it is, why should I do that" but it helped me get a better feeling for it. Sure, its something else while driving but maybe theres a street in the fields or something where you can practice. I cant really explain it to you since now it all feels natural but youll get there if you want. I dont know about germany but here if you only drive with automatic youre only allowed to drive automatic in the future. To be honest automatic is kinda scary to me since it drives off more or less on its own. But I hope it works for you! Good luck.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I always self harmed on my thigh out if fear people would see it. I was never a fan of shorts so noone would see them anyway. If I had to change with other people I covered them with a huge bandaid since they were all really close together and a big ome was enough to cover them. I do have one rather big scar on my arm though. When it was fresh I just wore a bandaid for months. People probably noticed something was going on but noone ever talked about it to me and I never heared anyone talking about it. You could either try switching places you self harm or just get used to long sleeves if you really dont want anyone to see them. I know someone who has lots of scars on their arm and I never heared someone talking about it but I dont know if they really never did or I just didnt hear it. I think people never really cared that much what I was doing so they never brought it up or really didnt realize what was going on. People will probably look at it in the beginning though. At least thats my experience.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>You dont need a "reason" to feel this way. Anyone can feel like that and anyone can be depressed. Sometimes it just feels normal to you because youre used to it but the truth is you have it rough. I always thought my life is normal and I shouldnt be depressed. Shouldnt be suicidal because people have it worse. But that doesnt matter. Everyone can feel that way. And just because your upbringing feels normal to you doesnt mean that it was not hard or tragicor whatever. If youre feeling this way you can and should seek help. You dont need to explain them how it came to you feeling this way. Thats the therapists job. All that matters is that you feel this way and that your feelings are valid. No matter your circumstances. Mental illnesses are just like the flu or a cold. Everyone can get it. Some tend to get it more frequently than others but in the end it could hit everyone.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I had one. It was just a huge log cemented into the ground with a little wooden house ontop and my dad insisted on a rope ladder which made it a huge pain in the ass to get up since it was under the door and you needed to do some kind of acrobatics to get in. I always hated heights so it was a horror tripto get in but when we were in it was lots of fun. Although it was rather small. We could get stuff in through one of the windows since you could reach up there from a climbing thing if you were tall enough so sometimes we eveb had dinner up there. Once slept i there with friends and it was fucking cold although it was summer. TL;DR: It is nice but kinda overrated. Especially if you have a rope ladder and are afraid of heights.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Its fine. I know how it feels so its important to me to help people who are going through the same thing. It might take some time to really take it in and accept it 100%. Therapy helped me a lot with coming to terms that my feelings are valid too and that im not egoistic just for looking after me and that its normal to have bad days. Ive also came to accept those bad days since they helped me appreciate the good days even more. After all we cant have good days without the bad ones. And one day youll be looking back realizing that youve managed all that though shit and became a really strong person without knowing it. Knowing you fought and didnt just take the easy way. Its something you can be and should be proud of. If you ever need someone to talk to feel free to message me. I might not respond immediatly but Ill try my best to answer as soon as possible (job, life, depression, ect.)</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Not a kid but as a teen I had no electricity for a while. My room had a seperate electricity switch or however you call them so my dad just turned it off. It was spring so it would get quite dark rather quick and I couldnt do anything. Wasnt allowed to go to friends or leave my room either, only to use the bathroom and for lunch/dinner. It probably wasnt that ling but it felt like forever and it ki da drove me crazy not being able to do shit.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>To make things clear: he raoed you and you owe him nothing. You dont have to give birth to this child and you shouldnt feel bad if you want to abort it. Butt if you do feel bad think about it this way: how will the child feel? A rapist as a father who doesnt seem mentally stable and a mother who maybe cant bring herself to love it due to what happened. I think abortion would be the best option although its 100% up to you what you want to do. You should look into getting therapy. You went through a lot and you should probably work on it so you can at least try and leave things behind. I was sexually harrassed when I was younger and only got therapy like 15 years later and if I knew how much it helps I woukd have tried it earlier. It can be hard on you, probably will be at times, but overall I can say it helps a ton. Last but not least: look after yourself and try to keep the people who pressure you or are mean to you out of your life. You did nothing wrong and you shouldnt feel bad. Those people dont know what happened and probably dont really think about what they are saying and how it feels for you. Dont feel bad to just cut them out of your life. It might be hard and maybe youll feel bad but you shouldnt. You have every right to do so. After all you went through something horrible and you have to live with it, not them. Learning how to look after yourself can be quitr the journey but its really important, especially if youre in a situation like you are.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I think my dad and I had an arguement about me cleaning my room. We both started shouting (like usual) and when it was over I went to my room, slaming the door like any angry teen would. He told me to not slam it so I did it again. To be fair it happened quite regularly that my dad and I got into an argument about litteraly anything.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Yeah. I dont really remember the anime anymore since its been a couple of years but I really like the manga. It has two official endings which I think is really cool and I still cant decide which one I like more. The art style is a bit strange (well only the noses) but you should really give it a try. It took really long but the manga is finally finished and I really dont regret buying it.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I dont know about the author dying but the manga finished. It has 7 volumes although the last one is like only half as long as the rest. The ending really touched me and I can tell you about it in a DM but Id rather not spoil anyone who wants to read it here. But its great and Shiro is still my favourite character to this day.</TEXT>

It also has some other stories in it. I dont know how many but one of them I really liked too.</TEXT>
