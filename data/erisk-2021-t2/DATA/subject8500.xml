    <TEXT>I have the flu, my fiance who has been in close contact with me does not have the flu. She is currently breast feeding and I've read that babies get their anti-bodies from their mother's milk. I'm wondering if drinking her milk will help me overcome this flu. Has anyone tried this?</TEXT>

    <TITLE>Wiki Leaks - what am i missing?</TITLE>
    <DATE>2010-12-08 03:39:51</DATE>
    <TEXT>OK it seems good to leak things like: war cover ups, corporate cover ups, people doing bad things. But i don't see the value in leaking things like lists of critical infrastructure terrorists might want to hit. I also don't really see the point of leaking cables between countries (i'm referring particularly to the Australian Rudd-Clinton cables, which seem like reasonable communications between countries) Is anyone who is pro-WikiLeaks anti these types of leaks? Or is the whole point, you just leak everything?</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I prefer to use the default partitioning the OS gives me. If its Ubuntu, i use what they consider default If its RHEL, i use what they consider default There is usually a reason they are suggesting the default and it will make upgrading much easier. I find life is a lot easier NOT customizing something if I don't have to (I learnt this over many years, and I think a lot of the guys with 10+ years experience will agree with this).</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I was thinking that if you shoot first you have an advantage. Obv if the people are really close together everyone will die (think HoneyBunny/Jules/Ringo in Pulp Fiction). But if they're like 5m-10m apart, won't there be a good chance you can shoot first and move at the same time? Obviously as n increases it makes the chance of survival more likely.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Just received a Term Sheet, it says "based on a pre-money valuation of $x including a notional available option pool of Ordinary Shares of a number that is 15% of the total issued share capital of the Company from time to time". In another section it says: "Option Pool: An unallocated option pool of X shares, which represents 15% of the anticipated post-money valuation of the Company after closing of this equity round. The Option Pool, allocated and unallocated, is included in the Pre-Money Valuation of the Company" What does this mean?? An example would be great.. Thanks</TEXT>

    <TEXT>From my understanding we win automatic qualification to Asian Champions League. Australia gets 2.5 spots? So Premiers get one Grand Final winners get one Not sure what happens if it is the same team - either the 2nd place team from the league or the GF runner up I guess. And then the next team down the list must get the 1/2 spot. So you do 'win' something as Premiers</TEXT>

    <TEXT>thanks - appreciate the feedback. I will take your feedback especially on the fonts on board and improve. Our software is basically made for kids (5 years+) so a lot of the designs are the first things students will have made. It is likely to be more creative than engineer-y or functional (at least at the moment) As more people 'like' stuff better designs will hopefully bubble up.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I guess it depends on the use case... the use case we've seen most of (in elementary) is for it to just print, no modding to do different things, no changing around. I think in middle/high school you can have more diy machines... I think $599 is pretty reasonable for a printer as long as it works... i've seen so many broken down printer in schools - the time it takes for a teacher to fix a printer/prints quickly adds up and has to be factored in as it is a teacher's time... In fact we're co-located with a Fab Lab and one of the most reliable printers over *years* have been the Up printers.. there are many others in states of dis-repair around the lab... I personally don't think Open Source is a requirement for the mass school market (i emphasize *mass*) Out of interest, what would be in your top 10, we're searching for the best 'plug n play' for elementary and have about 20 printers so far.. this is very close to the best we've seen. I'd be interested to get more from your top 10!</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Sorry if it came across like that. Not my intention. Fwiw we pay for our printers and review them fairly. We've been looking for a low cost 'plug n play' printer suitable for non-tech people for a while now.. I was excited to get this one. That being said.. This printer is not perfect. The perf board really sucks, esp in schools. I've seen so many people hurt themselves getting prints off!</TEXT>

    <TEXT>ha yer - very trashed! I personally think this is a fast-transition stage an eventually a lot of these printers will be 'plug n play' and they'll just work.. This Up Mini 2 has some of the features that are a step in the right direction.. it is still not perfect. With our old Up's, whenever we used non genuine (or non Zortrax) filament we had trouble - I think because of the higher heat. Pretty much gave up trying to save $10 on a roll (Zortrax vs generic) because if it clogged up just once the savings are gone in the amount of time you spending fixing it.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>haha fair enough.. we have an Up Box too.. - it is much more 'plastic-y' than the Up Mini 2.. the Up Mini 2 feels much more solid and better designed, it also has WiFi and an LCD - so easier to use (although print quality probably similar). Perf board still sucks and the filament caddy is pointless. If you get a chance to check one out, it is worth your time.. but i understand your point too. I've spent countless hours trying to fix specific printers - its enough to give you PTSD.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Yup - there are cheap printers on the market. I do think that schools will pay for reliability/durability. For a school, $599 is not a lot considering a lot of schools will have either 2:1 or 1:1 computers/tablets at $500+ each. For the cost of a few computers/ipads a school can introduce their students to 3D printing. I also think cheaper printers are similar to buying $50 paper printers from Walmart and running them in the office. I could buy 10 of them for the cost of the laser printer we have in our office, but there is a reason why we don't do that.</TEXT>

It was on a table with a bunch of other printed stuff, they did have a bunch of different levels of 'polished' metal which was really impressive - the lowest level is really dull and the highest level is very polished like these bits - i just figured it was printed, but i could be wrong... they said it was 500k-1 million to buy and could print titanium .. ??? they also had FlashForge Creator Pro - they said they pre-print everything on that before putting it on the metal printer.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I've always dev'd on Windows - previously with a remote Linux machine (tmux + vim), and currently with a local VM (tmux + vim). I'm keen to try RubyMine, but performance on my Win laptop (either native or VM) is unlikely to be great. I tried Rails natively on Windows about 4 months ago and gave up - not really tenable, bash is horrible. So my current options: * Macbook Pro (expensive) * Remote Linux dev (but can I do RubyMine like this?), will it be fast enough? (remote vim was fast, but it is lightweight)</TEXT>

    <TEXT>But.. The idea of comparative advantage is a country should play to its strengths. We have no real discernible advantage in wind or solar... So many countries can work on that tech...so many countries have wind and sun.. Nuclear however.. We have a huge natural advantage.. . In the nuclear cycle there is 4 parts - mining, enrichment, power generation, and storage. Australia is probably the best place in the world for mining and storage. We could be at the forefront of enrichment and generation.. But instead (like with other stuff we mine) we export it.. So the high value and high tech stuff is done offshore... And we're left with just digging stuff up. It'd be great if we were tech leaders in this.</TEXT>

The slogan is simply against the interference of those governments [i.e. US, and Israel]".[37] Iranian president, Hassan Rouhani has also dismissed the literal interpretation of the slogan, stating that the slogan is to express opposition to US intrusive policies rather than hatred against American people.[38][39]</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Ok I looked some things up as I couldn't get a handle on how much water 96 million litres is There are 35,000 people in this council. The internet says people use on average about 340 litres of water per day. The people in this council use: 35,000 \* 340 = 12 million litres per day. So this is about 9 days worth of water for the council (as far as people using water), I am guessing there are probably farms/industry that use a whole lot more. After doing this - it doesn't seem as bad as the headline. I guess it depends how much difference 96 million litres make to the people and what the council can do with the money they got for it. \- I also think people shouldn't buy bottled water.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>i worked at a hedge fund during the GFC, at a startup now for me, I think the GFC felt worse - the GFC felt like there could be a systemic problem that would destroy the banking sector and have ramifications throughout the structure of society. covid feels more like - "we'll lose 3-6 months of productivity then be back at it". I think governments get this, even right-wing/conservative governments - if there is every a time for govt intervention, it is now (wars and pandemics). GFC had a huge 'moral hazard' issue that we don't have at all now.</TEXT>

One good thing is - we don't actually NEED 100% of ppl to stay at home, I saw one article that said they modeled a minimum of 80% required to stay home. Also, going to the beach, in the sun - as long as you stay away from other people (e.g. don't crowd around the icecream cart) it is probably one of the better places to be- UV generally kills viruses pretty fast.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Yer I think that seems to be the case - degree of transmission I think in hindsight it is easier to say, but at the time it would have been really difficult. Even now there is still no hard consensus on transmission / adequate distancing / treatments / antibodies etc, and we've had months of experience, not weeks. If they'd come out and said "it is HIGHLY contagious, lock down everything" but it turned out not to be, then they look like clowns too. I think when Wuhan shut down hard, many western governments were like "they're nuts, crazy Chinese, that will never happen here". However, if we see a Chinese city locking down that hard again, I guess the west will respond differently now. Like Singapore locked down hard and it seemed to work initially (using their SARS experience), but they forgot foreign domestic workers who live in cramped quarters and were under-tested and protected... They won't make that mistake next time.</TEXT>

I remember reading somewhere that artists in Asia would often learn by copying their teacher/a master and once they were good enough copies the teacher/master was happy to sign their name to it.

    <DATE>2020-05-13 23:06:53</DATE>
    <TEXT>A problem is their customers (local and overseas students) pay for an education. But universities provide the education AND assess if the student (and by implication themselves) did well. Universities are scared to fail overseas students and have less customers - this also extends to local students who have cashed up/connected family who'll threaten to sue the uni if you fail them (just ask your local med school) **Simple fix: remove this conflict of interest by separating the education and assessment part of universities.**</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Why is it idiotic? School students are educated by teachers but then assessed by a standardised exam set by different organisation. You rule out any favouritism or bias by doing this. In fact it seems to be common sense to me. Otherwise you have a situation of 'self regulation' - with way wonky incentives. In the original post I also mentioned local students doing this .. 100% students who fail but have high powered parents can pressure unis to pass them. Seen it a lot. It's the same conflict whether it's international or local students.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>OK i agree with some and not others: * Turns it into "preparing for the exam" - maybe it is assessed in some other way, not an exam. The important part is the external assessment. * LOL - I did Computer Science at a G8 uni - dno about making "practitioners in those fields cringe" but we learnt stuff that was way outdated/academia only. But I don't have a problem with that - "learning to learn" etc. But I don't think this point is addressed with current system. * Yer maybe non-exam assessment * Yer maybe non-exam assessment * This last point you make doesn't work for me. It feels like in a different context you might argue "uni is not about practical skills, its about theory and learning to learn etc, if you want practical skills, go to a TAFE" The stress part of it - personally I don't mind that, life is stressful, work is stressful - best to learn to deal with it. Many people get stronger with stress - to test themselves, to strive hard for something. For some people it doesn't work, but for others it brings out their best.</TEXT>

Whilst Japan has an aging population, we can continue to import young people to maintain standard of living for everyone. 2. Resources - we have a TON. We can sell a LOT of land off.

    <TEXT>No I don't smoke and never have, I also remember the time when you could smoke in bars/pubs and it was TERRIBLE. But I do think a fully informed adult, aware of the risks etc, should be able to make choices, even if they're not what I would choose. I think it is WRONG that I could be fined for not wearing a helmet when I'm riding at walking pace in a park. I commute about 3 times a week on a bike, and I wear a helmet as I'm going through the city, I just don't think it should be a legal thing or I should be fined if I happened to forget my helmet. FWIW: * Australia was one of the first (and still one of only a handful of countries) in the world that has a mandatory helmet law) - we're a weird outlier * The reduction in cycling injuries since bringing in mandatory helmet laws is about the same as the number of people who have stopped cycling * We have low participation rate in cycling - esp since bringing in mandatory laws * The rest of the countries in the world (i.e. most of them) without mandatory helmet laws get by fine * There are studies that show wearing a helmet actually makes drivers more dangerous to cyclists * There are studies that show that our low participation rate actually hurts us more due to unhealthy lifestyles/obesity than the injuries from biking accidents * I'm 110% for better cycling infrastructure * I'm 110% for not having government regulate every part of an individuals life * I'd love for it to be normal to hop on a bike to the shops instead of taking a car</TEXT>

    <TEXT>well look mandatory seatbelts i agree with, and they're in almost every country in the world. just because something is for 'safety' doesn't mean it's necessary - risk and return have to be weighed up. We've found the inconvenience of seat belts is worth it compared to what happens if you don't wear them. mandatory helmets? not so much, we are one of only THREE countries in the world that have mandatory helmet laws - are Denmark/Finland/Germany/Spain/...(100+ other countries) all crazily reckless, or do you think we may just have got it wrong? if you are just arguing "well its safer, so we should do it", then we should wear helmets walking around too, because that's probably safer too.</TEXT>

I also recall reading France built out like 70% (?) Of all energy needs via nuclear in less than ten years and this was decades ago.. https://www.economist.com/business/2016/12/01/frances-nuclear-energy-champion-is-in-turmoil To me that's incredible.. if we started today in nuclear we could be totally carbon negative and have abundant cheap energy in ten years.

    <TEXT>I have an English friend who did his PhD in nuclear something or other. He told me a few years ago, that if you took all the nuclear waste the UK had generated in 60 years (which is \~20% of their total power), it would amount to an olympic sized swimming pool worth of waste. 1 or 2 barrels deep. The barrels would contain vitrified fuel (enclosed in glass?) that could be re-processed later. It is such a phenomenally small amount of waste compared to other forms of energy. I didn't have any reason to doubt him but then I read this post a few months ago that really backs up this point, the amount of waste generated for the energy produced is MINISCULE. [https://www.reddit.com/r/todayilearned/comments/gftwrm/til\_france\_has\_58\_nuclear\_reactors\_generating\_716/fpwr3m5/?utm\_source=share amp;utm\_medium=web2x](https://www.reddit.com/r/todayilearned/comments/gftwrm/til_france_has_58_nuclear_reactors_generating_716/fpwr3m5/?utm_source=share amp;utm_medium=web2x) Also there **are** geological rock formations that are a good place to store waste - if they've been stable for millions (or billions) of years they're almost guaranteed to be stable for a few hundred or thousand more. There were literally natural nucelar reactors that bubbled along for millions of years ( [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natural\_nuclear\_fission\_reactor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natural_nuclear_fission_reactor) ) and there are plenty of places on earth that are much less safe and more likely to be stumbled on by future generations than where they're proposing to put this waste.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>The idea is for 25k the govt can get a lot more 'bang for buck's by releasing private money. Housing is a reasonable place to do it for the multiplier effect: "Dwelling construction been extensively researched by the ABS in years gone by, and the data uncovered showed the construction industry to have a very strong multiplier effect on the economy. Here's the ABS #160;on the effect of construction on the multipliers on the wider economy in terms of output and employment in Australia: For every $1 million spent on construction output (houses, non-residential buildings, etc.) in 1996-97, a possible #160;$2.9 million in #160;output would be generated in the economy as a whole, giving rise to nine jobs in the construction industry (the initial employment effect), and 37 jobs in the economy as a whole from all effects." So for 150k you theoretically get an almost 1 million dollar bump and 10+ jobs</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Cost, it will get cheaper as you build more. Australia has lots of places to build that are safe.. i.e. Not on ring of fire etc Time to build is largely a myth .. 374 out of 441 nuclear plants built have been less than ten years. France moved to ~70% of ALL their energy requirements to nuclear in about ten years and that was the 70s. We would completely smash carbon targets in ten years if we start today Know-how I agree... We don't have it .. yet. But we are a country that should get it seeing as we have the world's largest sources of nuclear fuel AND the best place to store waste/possible future fuel. There are like four bits to the nuclear cycle... Mining, enrichment, energy gen, and storage. We have #1 and #4 as natural competitive advantages .. better than anywhere else in the world. We could do #2 and #3 and be leaders. Wind? Solar? We have zero advantage.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>It's actually not too fancy - a De Longhi Magnifica S I've tried a lot of other things: manual machines, burr grinder, aeropress, nespresso etc, but have found for the effort (press two buttons) you get a great cup as long as the beans are fresh-ish (after 4+ weeks from roasting I find they're not great). You have to do milk manually which is probably the only downside, but fully automated with milk-in-a-fridge is probably too expensive for me.</TEXT>
