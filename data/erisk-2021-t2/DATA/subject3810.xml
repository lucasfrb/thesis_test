    <TITLE>A question on upgrade packs</TITLE>
    <DATE>2020-06-15 06:24:59</DATE>
    <TEXT>I'm new to 40k and looking at starting a space marine army. I keep seeing upgrade packs for various chapters, what are these and how would I use them if I decided to buy one? Edit: Does 40k have an alliance system like AoS? I.e if I had an army of space wolves could I perhaps throw an imperial knight in there?</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Just saying I've read rumours that Bungo wanna transform Destiny 2 into a WoW like mmo with a divided player base, a good side and a bad side, Light and Darkness. If in this event, or something even more similar to choosing between Drifter or Vanguard, I'm choosing Darkness</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Id love to see the players choices and actions influence the ultimate end of destiny on a large scale. Like if dark does outnumber the light then the dark wins. Or if its evenly matched, they do a live count of crucible victories or something along those lines and the winning side wins destiny</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I've noticed that the Wildwood Rangers and the Eternal Guard are the same box. I'm planning a Sylvaneth/ Wood elf kinda army and was curious is theres anything against building an Eternal Guard unit with the Rangers hood instead of the helmets? As long as I make it clear at the start of a game who they are, there shouldn't be a problem, right?</TEXT>

    <TITLE>What's the deal with the Scarlet Keep</TITLE>
    <DATE>2020-08-29 10:12:01</DATE>
    <TEXT>I loved shadowkeep as an expansion and the keep itself, I find it so interesting but I have so many questions about it, mostly lore that I either haven't found, simply overlooked/missed or even forgot (I played the story a year ago and have the memory span of a potato) Firstly, why was it built? What purpose does it serve? Secondly, why did the vanguard "monitor" its construction? Why didn't we do something about it. Thirdly, who oversaw its construction? Was it Savathun or Hashladun? Someone else entirely? 4th, how does the keeps construction fit in the lunar pyramid? I love the keep, and felt like it was left mostly unexplored. I could be wrong but we got a strike, and a dungeon but I really feel like something like the scarlet keep couldve made a nice kings fall style raid. In both the strike and the dungeon I found several doors that wouldnt open, so that tells me definitely that theres unexplored parts of the keep. I know bungie puts random doors in places (not the black clouded ad spawning doorways) but actual doors that do nothing. The curiosity in me cant help but wonder whats on the other side</TEXT>

    <TITLE>Do you trust ol' Drifter?</TITLE>
    <DATE>2020-10-19 10:35:26</DATE>
    <TEXT>Not really lore, but a discussion, one of my favourite questions to ask my friends. Do you trust the drifter? In his quest, I did side with him. He is a very mysterious and interesting man, very smart and all round badass. I do think he is up to something, hes very sketchy, as I'm sure some of you have heard in his "drug deal" phone call from the contact event, that made something tick in my mind. Although he is very mysterious, and as much as I know hes doing something very sketchy, i like to think he has my trust, and i have his. Maybe hes waiting for the right time to reveal what his purpose is. I'd hate the idea of him backstabbing us, but if he does I also like to think wed kill him, or wed end up on his list of people gunning for him at least. Do you trust him? Why? Do you not trust him? Why?</TEXT>

    <TEXT>In lightfall, I have this idea that destiny 2 will end the same way it began, we lose the light, a reprised version of this song plays, only this time we dont come back like we did at the beginning. Its over. Ghosts little "eye light" goes out and he drops to ground and breaks. Our guardian weak, falls to their knees, and reaches out to the husk that was Ghost. They look around and see fellow ghosts and guardians on the ground. They look up and see the looming darkness, the pyramid(s?) Swarming the dying or already dead, faded traveler. We see a shadow grow over the field of dead ghosts and dying guardians. Our guardian slumps to the ground as the shadow covers them. The soundtrack reaches its climax and the screen goes black. "Destiny 2- Lightfall" appears on screen. Credits roll.</TEXT>
