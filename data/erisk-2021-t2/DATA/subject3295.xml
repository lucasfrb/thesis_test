    <TEXT>Well, It is possibly one of the best phones for gaming because of the a13 bionic and powerful gpu, so can't technically say it isn't great for gaming... BUT what you can say is that it's battery isn't great.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Oh wow. I feel embarrassed about my setup just looking at this. Absolutely gorgeous. BUT I think some red lighting on the PC case should improve the looks a bit. Nice pick with the color scheme tho!</TEXT>

    <TEXT>It's best to open up the entire board and add foam on the bottom of the housing, but you can also place the board above a mouse mat or a foamy material to reduce the noise slightly. It varies among different housing materials so this might have significant to no difference.</TEXT>

    <TEXT> gt;een's only 720p (technically 750p). You won't see a difference past that. Maybe audio quality?  gt;  gt;Re Nah it upscales the resolution so more pixels are generated and fitted in the display but because it is not true 4k (displays actually capable of it) you won't get that full crystal clear experience.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>It #8217;s more than enough for me, I use my phone for youtube, reddit, other social media platforms like twitter and instagram, and it lasts just long enough for me to charge before bed. Or so it was. I just recently updated to ios 14.0.1 and battery usage went down significantly. I had to find a cable somewhere in the middle if the day and it is annoying. Hopefully newer ios versions (14.2 or 14.1) will fix this problem. On ios 13, it performs just as I expect it to: more than enough.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Hey. I have a keyboard's stabilizers I want to lube (without desoldering) and can I use super lube's synthetic grease for applying to the sides and the bottoms of the stabs? I don't have dielectric grease and was wondering if synthetic grease will work.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>It might be because of the stab type. In my board, the rod that connects the two stabs are under the switch itself, making them unaccessible if not desoldered. I heard costar stabs can be pushed out of the frame and pushed back in Easily. that might be why</TEXT>
