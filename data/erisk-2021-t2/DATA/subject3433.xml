    <TEXT>Exactly. Here in my city in Brazil, we have 800.000 people, but it was made a projection using 600.000, and boy, it is scary. The projections are that 80% of the populations will get infected, and of those, around 40-50% depend on public healthcare system. Of those, it was projected that ate least 5% (something around 12.000 people) will need ICU beds in the public healthcare, and we only have 1000 beds. It's incredibly scary, but everything is already on shutdown, except for drugstores, grocery stores, supermarkets and hospitals. All schools are due to close this following week, but this week was already without marking presence. Churches are closed, shops are closed, bars, restaurants, malls... But it's so weird to think of what may happen... Ps: sorry for any mistakes, I'm Brazilian and English is my second language.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Show this to her. Yesterday a saw a post on IG that said "Trusting God doesn't mean not taking precautions. Noah was told about the Flood and he built the ark. Joseph was warned about the misery, and built barns. Mary and Joseph was warned that the king wanted to kill Jesus and went to Egypt. 'Do not tempt the Lord, your God.' Deuteronomy 6:16 and later on Matthew 4:7"</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Thought the SP governor has emitted a document stating that starting from Sunday (or Monday, I'm not sure) everything must be closed, including stores, bars, restaurants, touristic points, churches and schools. It'll only be open hospitals, drugstores, markets, etc. I'm aware because my mom is in a different state and can't come back home because of this.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I live in a city that is around 60mi away from Sao Paulo, and our mayor has already closed every city schools, shops and anything else that is not necessary, although the minority is closing bc most of the population can't afford not to work. The state governor has emitted an document stating that starting on Sunday (or Monday, not sure) everything that is unessential must be closed under the risk of a fine. A lot of comum citizens are already on social distancing, and schools and colleges/uni's are all close by Monday, apart from those that already closed. Me and my brother and parents are apart for over 620mi (aprox), and we are all staying home and leaving only for emergencies. A lot of people are panic buying, but a lot more can't afford panic buying... A friend of mine is terrified about everything that's been going on, because his parents have a shop and it can't be closed, or they'll broke. On the country's capital, Brasilia, since two weeks ago every school was told to shut down, and today everything else is closed by law, under a fine if open. My parents are there, and there's a lot of people hoarding stuff too, and there's 5 people on ICU over there. Our hospitals and public healthcare system were never something to say "it's good", so a lot of people are afraid of getting sick, because it's been a long time already that there aren't enough medical supplies, medications, beds, anything, and there are doctors that can't do anything other than take of their own income to afford those things, and often they end up being reused. At my city, we only have 1000 ICU beds (on total, not subtracting those already occupied) and the expected is that at least 12.000 people will need ICU treatment. The situation is ugly, and it will be even more if WE DON'T STAY AT HOME!!!</TEXT>
