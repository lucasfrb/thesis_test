    <TEXT>I did originally post this in shittyfantheories but it bugs me how internally consistent it is. My theory is that as soon as he starts smoking the Gandalf pipe, Seth Rogen makes a freudian slip about advocating homosexuality. From there, things slide towards them doing some kind of karma sutra thing on the floor in front of the TV. Everything after that they hallucinate while engaging in gay sex. They play out their insecurities, especially in their relationship and their feelings towards James Franco and Channing Tatum, while admitting that they think Craig Robinson has a big dick but that they really just want to be dominated by Danny McBride. They even have Emma Watson come into their shared fantasy but preferred to scare her off. All the while they are listening to Backstreet's Back (might as well have been *It's Raining Men*) and there is a slight earthquake in the area, making them imagine it is the Apocalypse.</TEXT>

    <TITLE>Game of Thrones setting theory</TITLE>
    <DATE>2014-01-30 21:33:04</DATE>
    <TEXT>First, I've got to say I am very new to George RR Martin's icy fiery wonderland. And I mean "fan for two weeks, not read the books, halfway through the second season"-new. So I might be wildly off with any or all of this. I think that unlike Tolkien's Middle Earth or George Lucas' far away galaxy, GRRM's work is set in a post-apocalyptic future for humanity on Earth. At some point humans master genetic engineering. This leads to an age of hubris and corruption as the rich distance themself from the poor by seeking power rather than new knowledge and discoveries. The Information Age gives way to a new feudal age that regresses into darkness as "Families" collide with one another for power. Instead of trying to eradicate polio or give people in the third-world better lives, these super-rich choose to use their money to give themself superhuman powers such as invulnerability to fire or having glowing eyes or being able to birth shadow demons (must have been a particularly eccentric rich person who asked for that). These aren't families in the normal sense, but more like conglomerates that adopt the people they employ and genetically give them traits to maintain the hegemony. Much like gang colours, the Families viciously guard the traits that they consider to make them better than others. Maybe they even copyright genetic traits, so for example, all blond people have to pay the Lannisters a royalty. It gets to the point that the poor simply choose to change their genes because it's cheaper than carrying on paying royalties. The Targaryens emulate the more powerful Valyrians with platinum hair but can't afford the glowing purple eyes, or they served the Valyrians and were rewarded with the hair genes. The Families also keep marriages between themselves to maintain exclusivity. Incest even isn't a problem because the richer families have such a good handle of fine-tuning genes. When Cersei mentions that Lannisters have committed incest to keep the bloodline pure, she's referring to something her family kept doing as a throwback from the time when people could manipulate genes through technology rather than breeding. The rich can also afford creatures tailor-made to their imagination, such as dragons and oversized canines, using these competitively against one another for their amusement or even as military aggression. Governments by this point are powerless compared to these families. Meanwhile, those who can't afford to be a part of these families or simply refuse genetic engineering are looked down upon as the outdated-humans. The first-draft humans, compared to the new superhumans. The *First* Men compared to the New Superior Men. Over time, that meaning becomes lost when the people proudly proclaim that it was the First Men who built the Wall. These people carry on being engineers and farmers while the rich are more caught up with their power games. Terraforming becomes a toy for the rich, and they are able to shape landmasses. This creates further instability for the poor and people struggle to pass on technological knowledge and slowly revert to mysticism. The powerful families stamp down on technological understanding and so feudalism takes hold as they retain all the power. By the time of the Valyrians, terraforming is used in conflicts between families, resulting in a series of cataclysmic events, the final being The Doom that seals their fate. By now, some among the Targaryens and such are left with powers that they don't even understand because mysticism has replaced knowledge. The people of Westeros are still speaking English, but don't call it that. Asia has become Ashai to them. Someone founded a city and called it Qarth in honour of Carthage. A people with Semitic or Palestinian roots have become the Lamb Tribe. And the remnants of some people who really went nuts with the genetic engineering wander the north as the White Walkers. Even the dragons almost died out because people couldn't take care of them properly. Edit: forgot to add the thing about Summers and Winters lasting for so long is also because of man-made climate change.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>A lot of things can be done within three years. An entire suburb of houses. An awesome bridge or something. Possibly even sharks with frikkin lasers on their heads if someone really needed that. I have difficulty believing that a movie needs three years to go from paper to distribution for any other reason than bureaucracy. Surely, with advances in technology, technical aspects must be getting easier all the time. Logistics, location scouting, casting, prop and set-making, and the all-important post-production must be a cinch with computers. Okay so I'm making an absurd simplification of the work that happens in a billion-dollar industry, but seriously... Three effing years?</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I just finished watching the movie and although the story had me hooked right to end, I felt unsatisfied and overall, disappointed in it. The reason I kept watching was for some explanation as to why Hector 2 does any of what he does. In any movie you want to understand the motivation of why any character does what they do. The only reason I could think of is "time-travel makes you retarded." Seriously, I was waiting for some explanation as to why H2 does all the things that he does and it never came. Why did he leave the lab after making the call? Is the narrative meant to say that time-travel makes you lose all sense of free will?</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Looking at this penny arcade strip: http://www.penny-arcade.com/comic/2014/05/07 got me wondering. I've always preferred it when he shoots webbing from his wrist. It just makes more sense. The only thing to make more sense would be if he shot it from somewhere else on his body. The idea of him using web shooters. Was this to avoid people associating Spiderman's web-shooting with something indecent? To avoid giving busybodies an excuse to complain that there's a comic where a guy goes around shooting a sticky white thing directly from his body? I've never seen the point in it otherwise.</TEXT>

    <DATE>2014-05-08 12:59:46</DATE>
    <TEXT>Since 4.4 came out we've slowly seen a few apps take up the ability to give the notification and nav bars a translucent gradient rather than being opaque. Having tried it in a few apps, namely Javelin browser and ~~Frank~~ Jack Underwood's Today calendar app (which just got a brilliant update that's sorted out the annoying All Day toggle bug and with other improvements that make it, frankly, kind of perfect) feel that the graded translucency just makes the screen look dirty like I'm looking at the app through a window. It's a good thing that apps such as Today feature the option to keep the opaque bars because that's what I prefer for now. Instead of a gradient, I would prefer to see a smooth translucency.</TEXT>

    <DATE>2014-06-02 21:27:25</DATE>
    <TEXT>Cage had been living the life of a Wall Street big shot. Then the actions of Kitty Pryde and Wolverine altered the timeline. But to Cage, his mind still retained the memories of the original timeline. He found himself living the domestic life with Te #225; Leone, they had kids and lived in New Jersey. Cage acts out the conflict by imagining it is the actions of Don Cheadle's character. But in the end he reveals that he is actually the most powerful mutant of all when he effortlessly changes the timeline back to what it should have been, eliminating the family life timeline for himself and dooming humanity to a dystopic future where everyone gets killed by the Sentinels. Feeling bad about losing his imaginary family and oncoming genocide of humanity brought about by the use of his powers he tries to make amends by interrupting Leone's flight. The chilling thing about the ending though is that we don't know if it was enough to change the future, or whether Cage was actually Apocalypse in disguise. He mentions living in Rome when it was the height of civilisation and living in New York when it's as important. This seems to implicate his presence in Ancient Egypt perhaps when the pyramids were being built. By Nicolas Cage. Singlehandedly.</TEXT>

The teal colour scheme though makes the nav bar seem more noticeable than before. I don't know how well it could work but I'd like to see a shaded nav bar instead. Same as they've done with the notification bar now. It should really compete the look. A mockup: http://imgur.com/4UUNXEW.png Yeah, it doesn't have the new nav keys, big whoop, want a fight about it? And the notification bar might be different as well. But it gives you an idea of how smoothly the nav bar would blend in with apps. Not transparent, but shaded.</TEXT>

    <DATE>2014-07-13 19:48:28</DATE>
    <TEXT>I have a great Panasonic camcorder I bought a while back. We don't find much use for it though, so I get kind of annoyed at having spent a lot of money on it. Recently I've been interested in getting a camera. While shopping around I've noticed that a big selling point on cameras is how good they are for taking video. In fact at one store the camera guy was telling me that an expensive camera that they have is so good that a whole season of the TV show House was apparently shot using it. So I'm thinking of maybe selling my camcorder and putting that money towards a really good camera. Other than the flippable display panel and the different form factor, is there any drawback to using cameras for video? Of course, I would be looking at getting a good bridge or even DSLR rather than a compact.</TEXT>

Of course, I understand this whole thing is an archaic way of looking at society. But it's still an interesting way of seeing how societies develop. Initially we're all equal/ly poor. Then there's the rich and the poor. Then priests and scholars add their spin to society to make it three. Then the media turn up saying they're not a part of the system because they're not biased. And now we have the fifth in the "blogotwitogram" or whatever it is now. What could the sixth be?</TEXT>

    <TITLE>Two requests from a new convert</TITLE>
    <DATE>2014-08-26 22:56:44</DATE>
    <TEXT>Aeons ago, when I first started looking into using an app for going on Reddit, I did consider several before settling on Reddit is Fun because it just recreates so much of the functionality of the web version. I might have tried it before and maybe it didn't stand out but trying it recently, RedditSync is now looking like a superior experience than RiF which is long overdue an overhaul. I've bought the paid version and have been using it for a few days but there's some niggling things I wish RSync had that would complete the experience and who knows maybe bring an exodus of converts sitting on the fence between RiF and RSync. Firstly, on RiF, every time you tap a link, this window comes up: http://imgur.com/txtprgw.png. This means we can see what URL we're clicking on and there's also options to copy or share it, giving flexibility. I know RSync has a similar thing, but I think having a pop-up window just makes it flow better, especially in long posts or ones with a lot of links. The second thing is, Saved articles seems to be tucked away like a dirty secret in RSync. In every other app I've tried, the Saved button is somewhere prominent and accessible. In RSync the only way I see is swipe  gt; profile  gt; tap  gt; saved. Ideally it should be in the swipe menu above or below Messages. Also it would be a nice touch to be able to save articles by sliding them to one side. I don't know how many people use "Hide" so maybe make it so we have an option to change the action to save instead when an article is slid. Or better yet, slide to the left to Hide, slide to the right to Save. Which would open the way to the masterful touch of being able to swipe from the right to open Profile/s, Messages and Saved and Options. While swiping from the left could be streamlined to just Subreddits (and multireddits).</TEXT>

    <TEXT>They're launching it in the UK only now I think because I've started to see ads for it, and each time I get slightly offended by the name because it seems a bit subversive to use the words "Amazon" and "Fire" in conjunction like that. It paints a horrible picture of the real Amazon burning. Why do they have to bounce between the words Kindle and Fire anyway? Amazon is the name of the forest and the river, so I think they should have gone with something based along the lines of the Amazon River, for the smartphone. Would have created a nice synergy as well. Amazon, the store, being "the forest," while the phone would have been the "Amazon River."</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I haven't read any of the EU books (apart from one called Darth Maul: Shadow Hunter) so I don't know if there's things in the background which invalidate my question. But it seems to me that Jedi enforce a practice whereby they actively recruit everyone with Force abilities into their ranks from childhood. This seems like they are forcing the Force-gifted into policing, in a very cold and sterile way at that, rather than letting them use their talents in industry or art, for example. Is this why, in their blinkered view, they are completely oblivious to what the rebalancing of the Force meant?</TEXT>

It's got me thinking just how powerful they were and how influential they could have been in determining the present time of this country. I would be happy to read explorations of both scenarios, one where the Romans conquered but tolerated and let the Druids flourish. The other scenario being where the Romans didn't conquer, and Britain would have been left to its own devices to develop, but still open to the subsequent invasions. My own thoughts are that the Druids would have held power like the Brahmin priests of India and maybe formed a class structure like they've had over there for a long time.</TEXT>

    <DATE>2014-10-15 13:09:17</DATE>
    <TEXT>The Classical image of the Jedi is like that of US Marshals, they went around enforcing the law when local law enforcement weren't enough. But more recently it has become apparent that they have more of a spiritual, even religious, platform for their workings. It seems to me that they were destined to fail, because they can't serve both. Either they are law enforcement or they are a religious order. Either they serve the law and justice, or they serve their own spiritual beliefs. In a religious empire you could have people enforce the religion of the state, but I believe the Republic was secular and so the Jedi seem more like a paramilitary. BONUS QUESTION that could change everything about the main question: How is the Jedi Order funded? Who pays them? Are they a government branch or do they operate independently?</TEXT>

    <TITLE>My thoughts on Cpt America's future in the MCU</TITLE>
    <DATE>2014-10-28 21:58:59</DATE>
    <TEXT>First off I have to admit that apart from the X-Men I know next to nothing from the Marvel Comics so everything here I've gathered from the movies that have already come out and the chatter and speculation into the ones that are coming. I've never read the "Civil War" arc, only read that it involves the Cap's death. The prevailing word is that Captain America as we know him, Steve Rogers will die in an upcoming movie. But from watching CA: The Winter Soldier, I haven't stopped wondering why the titular antagonist had such a minimal role in the story. He was certainly present in pivotal moments but he didn't seem to have any bearing on the story and could have been interchangeable with any assassin character. Which leads me to suspect that it's not Bucky but Steve Rogers who is "the winter soldier". The events of this movie set things in motion and in the next installment we'll see him transition into that persona. Going by the theory presented here: http://www.reddit.com/r/FanTheories/comments/2kkfzj/marvel_the_civil_war_isnt_what_we_think/ I'm inclined to agree that the "civil war" won't be about superhero registration but about governments taking liberty with citizens' freedoms. In essence it will be a new Cold War, one between power-hungry forces and the people they purport to be protecting, ushering in a Winter of Distrust, with Steve Rogers, once a champion for the authorities, being left out in the cold, forced to fend for the ideals he stood for, without the authoritative title of "Captain America". We've already seen him start down that path in CA2. The current speculation is that Steve Rogers will die and either Bucky or Falcon will take on the mantle of Captain America, but I think the writers could take us for a double loop. Instead of Rogers, it would be Bucky in the guise of the Captain who will die. Some difficult circumstances will have lead to this, and Bucky will make the ultimate sacrifice for his friend. Steve Rogers will let the death of "Captain America" galvanise support for his cause while he continues fighting directly in his new guise as "the Winter Soldier". Meanwhile Falcon will become the second Captain America. This way the writers have their cake and eat it too, a death for a major character who then returns in a following movie. It's a plausible way of recreating the comic world's trope of characters never really dying. ...Except for Bucky, who will have died twice. Though to keep things cool they could have the same actor carrying on playing "Winter Soldier" until he takes of his disguise.</TEXT>

That got me thinking about what if he got a symptom like that naturally from a disease as he aged. His power wasn't invulnerability or a healing factor. His power is literally immortality, in that he comes back to life after dying. So if he kept that power and aged and then died of a natural cause, how would his power react? Would he suddenly be young again or would he only come back as old as he was when he died, and then die naturally again, so that his death rate would get closer and closer together unto he became a zombie?</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Maybe more of their back story is explained in the book, but in the movie they make it look like Drago commands *all* the dragons he captures. I can't quite grasp how he could have enthralled the alpha he had in his army. It looks too big and thus, too old, to have been raised from birth by Drago to see him as its master. In the Tolkien-verse, dragons have the ability to hypnotise and enthrall humans. I'm guessing Drago was actually doing the bidding of his alpha, not the other way round. The alpha wanted to kill others such as the Bewilderbeest, and keep getting more powerful. It's smarter than the average alpha and worked out a long time ago that it could use a human to do its legwork. It enthralled Drago when he was weak and gave him the impression that he was in control.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>We've seen EA have creative licence in making games set in the universe, such as that Aragorn game and the Assassins Creed clone. Furthermore it seems their licence entitles them to use the likenesses from Peter Jackson's movies. So could Jackson himself make movies set after the events of Return of the King? Just to make it clear, I'm no fan of the Hobbit movies, I saw a bit of the first one and have avoided the next two. I understand Jackson can't use the Silmarillion without Christopher Tolkien's permission. But surely he can expand on the universe he's created across the movies he's made?</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I've heard of how Kit Harrington's contract for Game of Thrones meant that he couldn't cut his hair short. And yet in the new movie Testament of Youth (haven't seen it, don't want to see it, looks boring) for the first time I see that Kit has short hair. Now I see three conclusions to jump to from this: 1. He did his scenes for this movie long enough before the shooting for Season 5 and so they were okay with it, knowing his hair would grow back in time. 2. He's wearing a wig in Season 5. 3. Stannis extols a punishment on Jon not too unlike Davos and his fingers.</TEXT>

However you define it, but along the same line as The Force, from Star Wars. In that it chooses who to empower with super speed and enables them to use it.

    <TITLE>An improvement I'd really to see in the Overview menu</TITLE>
    <DATE>2015-02-08 19:09:09</DATE>
    <TEXT>Lollipop has completely changed how useful Overview is. The changes mean it can fill up with tabs very quickly, making it tedious to find what you're looking for. Especially because they stack on top of one another, unlike the clear visual language of before. All it needs to be much more user friendly is to take a page out of Windows or OSX. On those, when you're using an application you have a choice of minimising it, or closing it, when you want to do something else. The OS acknowledges the difference when you make that choice. On Android, the Overview menu makes no distinction between the two. How about recognising that you have minimised an app when you press the Home button to go out of it. And recognising that you have closed an app when you press the Back button to go out of it? When you press the Overview button it should only bring up tabs of things that you have minimised. *A second tap* of the Overview button could bring up the stuff you closed but which is still cached. This small touch could make a huge difference in how productive we can be with our Android devises.</TEXT>

    <TITLE>[ASOIAF/GOT] Danaerys Targaryen Theory [SPOILEROS]</TITLE>
    <DATE>2015-04-12 16:56:05</DATE>
    <TEXT>TL;DNWTR: Danaerys is going to become the main villain by the end. I did the searching and have seen that this theory in lesser forms has been shared on Reddit before, but I think I can make a case for Danaerys becoming a fully formed villain such that we won't have sympathy for her. I concede that it's not easy labeling villains in this world that's so rich with characters that traverse various shades of morality. Even The Mountain could be said to have been a troubled young man who instead of getting help was encouraged into becoming a monster. It's implied he might have had some illness that made him grow so huge but also caused him a lot of pain. It's mentioned that he got very bad headaches for which he drank huge amounts of the milk of the poppy. Hard to say anything in defence of the Boltons though... But onto Danaerys, or rather Cersei. I believe Cersei's story has been foreboding of what we can expect of Dany. Both were born into privilege but then given a bad deal, the cruelties they've had to suffer forging them into who they become. Cersei had been handed everything, which all turned out to be poisoned. She lost her mother, she was denied Rhaegar, Robert turned out to be a piece of shit to her; her favourite, Joffrey, became a monster, and when she becomes all-powerful as Tommy's Regent everything is rigged to make her self-implode. Her life has made her paranoid and cruel, and just when she's set to get away with all the things she's done in response, she is brought to heal and forced to repent for her sins and confront the person she's become. This mirrors Danaerys' lot in life. She also has had everything turn sour despite getting more power. Her path has been a reflection of Cersei's. Dany's had one thing after another taken away from her and constantly been humbled and forced to reflect on what her beliefs have gotten her. Losing most of her family and being hunted away from Westeros gave her a life-long hatred for its powerful families. She loved and respected Visaerys who only abused her. She grew to love her Khal, who showed his cruelest side when he enslaved the Lazhareen to fund his conquest on her behalf. When she tried to show mercy to the Lamb people it blew up in her face and cost her dearly. When she tried to liberate Astapor she instead hastened its destruction. When she persists in trying to bring a benevolent, kindly, rule over Meereen it just throws it back in her face, tells her that it *needs* its ugly side  #8211;the fighting pits, the slavery #8211; in order to survive. And so Dany starts to face the ugly truth that she needs to do likewise. When she considers how bloodthirsty and cruel Daario is, she reflects that she is not so different, inside. It's a premonition of the queen she'll need to be in order to rule Westeros. She's realising kindness will never be her thing. Doran Martell and Ilyrio Mopatis, both try helping her in order to help themselves. Both get screwed over by her unpredictability. Jorah gives her the best counsel, but is told to fuck off because he dares see her as an equal by the way he wants her. Daario on the other hand, she falls in love with because his savageness turns her on. Only he has the cruel nature to be her equal. In time Danaerys will accept that she has no love for Westeros, nor for its families nor for any people giving loyalty to her. She's simply been born to rule and the only way to exert it is through cruel determination. She's going to go for Westeros spilling fire and blood, no longer caring for who has to fall in order for her to rise. The scenario I imagine at the end is that she aligns herself with Euron Greyjoy and uses the dragonhorn because she can't control her dragons by herself. But the dragons are turned against her by the warg trivecta of Bran, Jon,  amp; Arya, saving Westeros from the rule of its most evil queen who will have lost all her humanity by the time she gets there. **So that is the "How" of it. Now to address the "Why."** I think that thematically, Danaerys represents Glamour. She offers the fantastical and false hope; she's the magical saviour and liberator for people who feel wronged, mistreated, downtrodden. What she offers is too good to be true, she personifies the element of fantasy in these novels. Despite being represented as fantasy, George RR Martin's writing is all about fantastic expectations being crushed by reality, about human flaws bringing out characters' true virtues by the part that they play. Dany receives hollow gifts because of her glamour. The only good things she has, she pays a hard price for. Sadly she herself is also taken by her own glamour and is not preparing to be a good queen by learning from good tutors and spending time with her dragons to train them to her command. She's expecting her image and a belief in virtue to carry her through. Virtue which she's going to abandon once she sees it's getting her nowhere. She won't be anyone's saviour or liberator, she'll take the Iron Throne because she wants it for herself. **TL;DR Danaerys will play out, and burn out, the last hold of magic in this world.** That's the only logic by which I see Varys, someone who hates magic, having been helping her.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Does anyone else feel that John Connington and Jaime Lannister are headed for a showdown? Maybe it's only because the JC chapters are written in a similar style to Jamie's but with less humour. I feel there are many parallels between the two that could mean they are on a collision course. **Honour**: JC lost his by failing to turn up Robert Baratheon for Aerys. Jaime lost his by straight up murderifying the Mad King's crazy ass. **Lands**: JC was stripped of his lands for falling Aerys. Jaime will never inherit Casterly Rock because Aerys put him on the Kingsguard. **Physical Loss**: JC is on borrowed time because of the greyscale taking over his body, starting in one hand. Jaime can no longer declare he is happy and he knows it by clapping his hands. JC has staunchly been carrying out his mission and is looking forward to it paying off "soon" after completing the difficult last part. Jaime has recently become a man with a purpose, going around racking up XP to redeem his honour, with deeds that serve the realm. An interesting thing is that Jaime has so far achieved everything diplomatically, using only threats of deploying a scorched-earth policy. John Connington muses during a chapter how if he had burned down the village instead of asking people to turn out Robert, then he might have got the job done. Tywin Lannister would have done nothing less. I think an epic confrontation is coming, where Connington will not refuse to duel the one-handed Jaime, and his own deformity will make them more evenly matched. Connington will see it as chance to show he can be as ruthlessly effective as Lord Tywin, and Jaime will have the stake of proving he is his father's son.</TEXT>

    <DATE>2015-05-12 17:49:13</DATE>
    <TEXT>There's a bit in the lead up to the Battle of Blackwater where Tyrion wants to send Tommen away for his own safety. Cersei is convinced it's a nefarious plot and she's concerned Tommen might get raped or something. Tyrion is tired of her distrust for him and darkly jokes that he might rape Tommen himself. I would have so enjoyed seeing the look of shock/fear/disgust/fury on Cersei's face. Lena Heady can do funny pretty well. Another scene I would have liked is during Tywin's funeral, when Tommen has just vomited and he runs off, then Jaime has a talk with him. This could have been a great scene for Nikolai to exhibit some gravitas for the character, as the two bond and they talk about how they deal with painful circumstances. It was a memorable passage to me and I think would have worked to show how there's so much happening below the surface for a character like Jaime and set up Tommen a bit more also as a character to sympathise with, as leadup to seeing more of him in S5.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I hadn't put much thought into it until there was a post here recently explaining that it was Jaqen who turns up at the beginning of Feast and kills one of the novices, then has taken that guy's identity at the end when Sam gets there. What are the prevailing theories on what Jaqen is doing in Westeros? We know he is one of the Faceless Men, that means his endgame is to assassinate someone, right? Could it be that his target is something complicated, like Azor Ahai for example, so he needs to first work out who that is before offing them? And that's why he's trying to get his hands on these magical equipment to help divine his target?</TEXT>

    <TITLE>[All Spoilers] Daario Naharis Theory</TITLE>
    <DATE>2015-06-08 12:38:22</DATE>
    <TEXT>So we all saw how the fighting pit scene went down. One surprise was that Jorah didn't die. But a bigger surprise was that Hizdahr did. The initial response is to think... Well, this let's him off the hook. He couldn't have been behind the Sons of the Harpies. They killed him. But look at what Daario was doing while the Son's were adding extra airholes to Hizzy. Look at what he was doing the whole time. During the first fight Daario was ingratiating himself and making his presence felt as Dany's protector, literally getting between Dany and Hizdahr. It was like he was saying that whatever happens, he was their to protect, even from Hizdahr if he had to. And all the while he was basically telling Hizdahr to shut up. He then literally told Hizdahr to shut up when Jorah showed up. I've read the theory about Hizdahr and Daario being in cahoots, but have never wanted to believe it, until this episode, because I think Daario's behaviour during this episode might have given him away. He and Hizdahr could have planned together for Danaerys to be attacked in the arena. Daario, being a bit pushy, had to be there to make sure it went through, and he wanted to make sure that Hizdahr didn't say anything that might give them away. Maybe they even planned for one or both of them to get injured while Dany got mortally wounded so as to look innocent. Only Daario had gone behind Hizdahr and instructed the Sons to dispose of Hizdahr as well. His co-conspirator dead, Daario would have an easier time assuming control of Meereen. I don't know if he still has the Second Sons in allegiance to him but I'm assuming they are there. So adding the Sons of the Harpy and retaining the services of the Unsullied he would have a good amount of force and be well-suited to ruling a people like the Meereenese.</TEXT>

    <TITLE>[Injustice Universe, Year Two SPOILER] How can a certain character wear a Lantern ring?</TITLE>
    <DATE>2015-08-16 16:14:12</DATE>
    <TEXT>Anyone who hasn't read or isn't reading through this awesome series, turn back now. So at the end of Year 2 our favourite son of Krypton-turned-megalomanic mass-murderer gets a yellow ring from Sinestro and becomes seriously OP. How did the ring not kill him instead? I thought the power of the rings was inherently magical? From what I remember, the Oans got the lantern technology from something called The Empire of Tears who gathered all the magic from the galaxy at the time and created the Lantern Prime or whatever it's called. So that means each ring is magic-powered. And Superman is always weakened in the presence of magic. I know there's the argument of "magic is just technology advanced beyond our understanding" but in the DC universes magic is uniformly supernatural in nature, with only a few practitioners who can use it. Kind of like The Force in the the SW universe, with only those that are sensitive and learned in it being able to use it. If there was any science to it then Batman would be all over that shit. And Superman is "allergic" to magic, so how does the ring empower instead of killing him?</TEXT>

    <TITLE>Seriously annoying problem with Textra</TITLE>
    <DATE>2015-08-27 15:34:49</DATE>
    <TEXT>A while ago they added sponsored Ads that show up at the top, and gave us the option of paying to not see ads. I've been using Textra for ages and thought it was good value to make the in-app purchase. Despite this I repeatedly see ads on my phone. When I tap to make them go away it instructs me to pay again, this time on a different Google Account I have on my phone. I need to have the other account for various reasons. It's the main account on my tablet, which is mostly for my young child to mess about on. So if she's on my phone, I switch YouTube to the other account so my feed doesn't suddenly full up with recommendations to watch kid's cartoons. Yesterday I tried removing the other account temporality so Textra might switch to my account. It worked but today I'm seeing the ads again because it's flipped back. Has anyone else had this problem? I changed my rating of the app from 5 to 2 stars, and now to 1, until they fix this issue. I got a reply saying they'll do something but despite sending them an email as they asked I've seen no improvement.</TEXT>

    <TITLE>Has the adage "There's no bad publicity" become untrue in the current age?</TITLE>
    <DATE>2015-09-23 16:52:42</DATE>
    <TEXT>I heard this on a podcast the other day, and I'm starting to think it's right to believe that bad publicity nowadays really can be just bad publicity. There was a point when it was a privilege of the few to be "in the news". Any time we heard about a person or a thing, even if it was bad news about them, we'd think "Well, they're still important enough, or there must be something important enough about them that I don't yet know about, that they're in the news." And because of that, we got shit like the Kardashians. Nowadays there's so much news available to digest that the opposite is much more true and bad publicity is only for shaming.</TEXT>

    <TITLE>Should Sir Ridley Scott step away from the Alien franchise?</TITLE>
    <DATE>2015-10-08 19:20:58</DATE>
    <TEXT>TL,DWtR: Much like Star Wars going from George Lucas to JJ Abrams, Ridley Scott should hand the reigns of the Alien franchise to someone like Neil Blomkamp. First off, I want to make it clear that this thread isn't about me thinking that Ridley Scott has lost the ability to make good movies. *I do think that,* I do believe that he has lost touch with his artistic side while becoming more capable with the technical aspects of film-making. He can make good-looking movies out of any old crap, like he did with the script of Prometheus and *a board game*. I think that just like the yes men that let George Lucas carry out whatever silly ideas he had for Star Wars, Sir Ridley Scott is surrounded by suits that want to see him make movies out of whatever money-making ideas they have instead of the man himself letting out the artistic inspirations he might have. And that's a good starting point for why he's no longer right for doing justice to the Alien franchise. No one's doubting that he has been and IS a great film-maker. But all of them have different talents that contribute in different ways to the films that they make great. For Ridley Scott I think he is made better when he works with someone else guiding his vision for what gets on the screen. Alien = RS + HR Geiger. Blade Runner = RS + Philip K Dick. Gladiator = RS + Russell Crowe hungry to make a make for himself. When Sir Scott is let loose to just do what he wants or is otherwise unrestrained by someone else's vision, we get overblown movies like Robin Hood, which I actually really liked for telling a thorough story into the Robin Hood mythos, but which a lot of people found boring. And nowadays the movie's he's making are clearly stuff handed to him by studio executives telling him, "Have a go at this, Ridley, you know it's going to do great with these young audiences and make a tonne of money. Maybe this is the one which you could finally boast about doing better than Jimmy Cameron's movies. Ooh, you'd like that, wouldn't you, sir?" The point I'm circling around is that he excels when he shares the burden of artistic talent with someone else. Why not take a step away and be Producer of the next Alien movie while Neil Blomkamp directs? Worked well enough for District 9. And The Martian doing well, again proves that the man is at his best when constrained by someone else's artistic vision. Maybe he should focus on bringing more sci-fi novels to the big screen. So, to summarise, he should move away from the Alien franchise, admit that everything good he had to contribute to it is contributed and be done with it. And how much of the Alien franchise is of credit to him anyway? It is just as much James Cameron's baby as it is Sir Ridley Scott's. Aliens successfully broadened the universe that Alien introduced us to. And after that, neither of them had anything to do with it for a long time. Now Ridley Scott wants to take something small and precious and make it into his grand work. He doesn't have the respect for it that it deserves, which the fans have for it and which admittedly wouldn't be there if he hadn't made the first movie that he made in the first place. But, my point is, that he hasn't made a movie like that since then. And it really doesn't work when you take something like that and try to force it into being something bigger. The Alien franchise isn't Ridley Scott's The Dark Tower series. There was nothing thought out about it from the beginning that means it should go in the direction that he is trying to take it into now. Think about how cringeworthy the sequel to Pitch Black was... Prometheus didn't even make as much money as they expected. So why not pull the plug on this obscene mess and just let Neil Blomkamp make his Alien movie/s?</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I watched it last night and I'm watching it again tonight, because it's *fucking awesome*. Unlike TS and even the lukewarm T3, TG feels like a true successor to T2. It's an action-packed ride of a blockbuster movie. If you truly enjoyed T2 for what it was then I don't see how you can't enjoy this one. The characters feel like they've been put to good use again. The action rolls out at a good pace to give us time to understand why the characters are doing what they're doing. The actors fill out their roles, to varying degrees. Jason Clarke and The Governator are great to watch. Emilia Clarke is acceptably hot if nothing else. Jai Courtney is a pleasant surprise for not making me want to claw my eyes out rather than see him again after that Die Hard movie he was in. But these were decent enough. The only sad thing about this movie is how it couldn't feature the real Sarah Connor nor Kyle Reese, by featuring the actors that made these characters iconic. But I am very happy with the direction they've taken the story in this movie. Okay, so it does feel like a TV spinoff rather than being on equal ground with either of the two first movies. But for an experience like that, we have movies like Mad Max Fury Road. TG has delivered on making the franchise fresh and interesting again and the movie is good enough to warrant rewatching for the action and to immerse yourself in the mythos of this ongoing story again. I can totally see why James Cameron gave it his endorsement and I hope the filmmakers behind it get to carry on with their vision rather than the franchise getting another reboot in the next movie. Seriously, watch it with an open mind instead of writing it off like the press did when it came out. I wish I'd seen it at the cinema instead of believing the non-hype.</TEXT>

    <TITLE>What settings do you keep your camera at?</TITLE>
    <DATE>2015-11-27 16:36:06</DATE>
    <TEXT>At first I was keeping the front camera at 7.7Mp and the other one at 5. I thought that I don't need photos to be huge, just sharp and good looking. And I kept the video setting at 4K because I don't take video often and prefer it be as good as possible when I do. Also, I've noticed that on phones such as the Xperias, the auto setting tends to default photos at 8Mp, so I assumed that it's just a good resolution for photos and maybe helps the sensor capture light the best. But I realised that I do tend to go into photos and try to zoom in to see what cool details and textures the camera has caught, and so I've set the resolution to max now. And funnily enough I've set the video to 1080 instead of 4K, because IMO the 4K just isn't worth it. Everything looks sharp but the bitrate seems terrible and there's nasty compression artefacts. HDR Auto is the default for me, switching to HDR+ when trying to capture scenery.</TEXT>

When the boys and the Stark party come across the dead direwolf they find a piece of antler under its head and this is supposed to explain how it died. Is there more to this? Any tinfoil based on it maybe? We know there's one ~~alias of Benjen~~ character who likes to ride around on a giant elk. Or maybe Others using reanimated elks? It's not like I'm expecting this was the first piece of some evil mastermind's plans to set things in motion, just whether there might be something more to it than the wolf dying innocuously.</TEXT>

In a moment of insanity he went back after the Millennium Falcon stopped shooting at his TIE fighter and shot the torpedoes himself. At the end of RotJ, his illness took hold very strongly and Sidious got tired of playing along with it, knowing that his apprentice had gone off the deep end and so ~~tried killing him with lighting, but Vader got the upper hand.~~ Actually, maybe Sidious wanted to help Vader by "killing" his imaginary friend, but things went horribly wrong and they both died. The moral of the story being that mental illness is not a laughing matter.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I can't remember now what it was, but something today made me wonder about this. We all have a certain degree of it, and surely we're all attuned to respond to different things in different ways, but has research been done into how people make use of it? Humans having been hunter gatherers for a long time, with gender-based division of labour... Women staying back in the family group lookin after the young while men go off to hunt... Could it be that women notice faces more easily in their peripheral vision, while men notice shapes and cues better... I'm not trying to convey a sexist agenda here, I'm just curious if there's been any research about this. I know there are hardwired differences between the genders such as how women see more colours than men, amongst other things like this.</TEXT>

    <TITLE>Will what we currently think of as "Governments" in the future become interchangeable with big companies?</TITLE>
    <DATE>2016-02-08 22:12:17</DATE>
    <TEXT>I saw this thought-provoking TED talk the other day (actually I consumed it in podcast form) and it made me think about how governments indeed are having an ever more dwindling role in actually governing the lives of citizens, while big companies. And with things like the [TPP Agreement](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trans-Pacific_Partnership) it is clear that the governments of developed nations are willfully giving more power to big companies. Will they stop pretending at some point that they don't run the world? There was a time when governments actually governed, but now they are more like a gathering of regulatory bodies while big companies make or break entire economies. What separates governments from companies is that they are not openly profit-driven, their declared purpose is to "keep the economy going". But obviously without tax revenue and a healthy GDP, governments would cease to function. Money is their lifeblood just like it is for any companies. It's been a long while since I read books such as Snow Crash by Neal Stevenson. My recollection is hazy but I think in that world governments had ceased to exist and in their place were giant corporations that openly ruled the world's geography. We've already kind of seen this in the real world, in history, when the British East Indian company took over the rule of the Indian subcontinent. Could the same effect apply across every continent in the future?</TEXT>

I've thought about how apps using the data connection in the background might also be sapping battery. And some apps I don't feel comfortable at all about using background data, such as ES File Explorer. There's some which you obviously wouldn't want to disable background data for, such as WhatsApp, YouTube, etc. Otherwise you wouldn't get notifications or updates about subscriptions, etc. Also, bear in mind it only disables it during data connections, they can still use a background connection when you're on WiFi.</TEXT>

    <TITLE>Discussion: the innovations in LG G5 vs SG S7, which resonates with you?</TITLE>
    <DATE>2016-02-24 18:28:25</DATE>
    <TEXT>When I was hearing about what LG were about to try out with the G5, the Magic Slot, I was excited about the prospects. Now seeing what they're really offering, it seems a bit tacky in my opinion. The idea of having these add-ons to switch between, especially having to take the battery out in order to switch, it really doesn't look appealing. On the other hand I've been really impressed with what Samsung have done this year. The S7 already has a great looking battery. On top of that, you can add the battery extending case, or instead put on the camera lens case and attach an interchangeable lens. This approach just seems much more appealing to me. I also don't see the appeal of the other two phones, the X series from LG. You can either get a great camera or a great screen. If you're a photography enthusiast, wouldn't you want a great screen to see your shots on? Also, they've again made a stylus-based phone with mid-range specs: http://www.gsmarena.com/lg_stylus_2-7926.php Why not have made it something to compete with the Note line? Why does having the stylus need to be a compromise?</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Let's say it starts with the US making allegations and rolling out legal proceedings "accusing" Saudi Arabia of having a hand in 9/11. After that, Britain stops selling weapons to the Saudis and all of the world stops buying Saudi oil as we move towards green energy and Iran for the oil we still need. Then the UN starts imposing sanctions on Saudi Arabia for their horrible human rights violations. Is there enough of a sense of unity and is there a thinking of Saudi Arabia as the "Muslim homeland" as it were, by Muslims across the world? Would Muslim people rise up in anger or would they stay more concerned with their own national interests?</TEXT>

    <TITLE>[MCU] Idea about a character helping another (SPOILERS for Captain America: Civil War)</TITLE>
    <DATE>2016-05-10 16:17:32</DATE>
    <TEXT>I've been thinking this seems a bit obvious to throw out as a theory, but listening to a movie podcast today where they discussed a lot about the movie without touching on this, I'm wondering now whether most people picked up on this or not... At the beginning of CA:CW we saw Tony Stark showcase his experimental technology that can act as therapy for people with traumatic memories. He demonstrates how it can help with difficult memories of his parents. At the end of the movie, Bucky voluntarily goes back into stasis, awaiting a time when the brainwashing that Hydra did to him won't be a liability any more. TL:DR: the next time we see these characters together, Tony Stark will forgive Bucky for what he did and offer to help him finally take back his mind from Hydra's mindhacking, and to maybe stop any chance of what happened to Tony's parents from happening again. By then, Tony's therapy technology will have been improved enough to be effective on Bucky to stop him from becoming a Winter Soldier.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Reading some of the opinions expressed here lately, it seems there's a lot of hate for ol' Atoney McGhee. Maybe it's just Johnathan Pryce's acting making the character much more sympathetic and genuine-seeming than the one in the books, but I see the character very much as "one of the good guys". How can anyone not side with him instead of characters like Cersei? Have you forgotten some of the things she's done, just because she had to suffer her walk of atonement? The woman is evil incarnate! The Golden Twins are especially unlikeable on the show. In the books we got to see more through Cersei's eyes, making her more sympathetic. And Jaime is currently going through his arc of redemption. On the show, Cersei is insanely entitled and self-righteous. And the show Jaime Lannister I find utterly detestable. He keeps making rash decisions and seems entirely consumed with himself and his sister, as if he never went through everything that happened in the Riverlands with Brienne.</TEXT>

    <TITLE>(Spoilers Everything) Did George RR Martin straight up lie about a certain character?</TITLE>
    <DATE>2016-06-02 08:52:07</DATE>
    <TEXT>We've previously had this to go on, regarding Coldhands : http://www.latintimes.com/george-rr-martin-debunks-benjen-stark-theory-coldhands-identity-be-revealed-winds-289660 It adamantly says that Benjen is definitely not Coldhands. Yet as of Episode S6S07 on the show Uncle Benjen is now quite clearly Coldhands. I guess GRRM does have a habit of inflating his cast with extraneous characters who only turn up for one thing, who are then easily merged with established characters for the show (Ilyrio Mopatis getting forgotten about and his moments with Tyrion having been given to Varys, for example). Do you think GRRM has different plans for Benjen? Or do you think he's going to say "Well he *became* Coldhands, but that doesn't mean Benjen *is* Coldhands, because technically..." etc?</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I posted this as a comment in r/asoiaf but felt it needs to be repeated here. Sandor Clegane has unfinished business with his brother. His endgame can't just be a rematch showdown with Brienne. Plus, the Mountain represents everything that the Hound has come to be against... abuse of power, abuse of knighthood, reckless collateral damage. And while it might be a more thoughtful denouement for unGregor in the end to be undone out by someone else, such as Brienne, it's still the Hound who has from the beginning been set up as his mortal enemy. It might not be a trial by combat, but they've very clearly been foreshadowing that a fight between the Brothers Clegane is coming eventually. Even in this last episode we had the scene where Sandor massacres those men, immediately followed by the one where Gregor wrecks that sparrow. It was meant to be a parallel. The Hound is the unstoppable force and the Mountain is the immovable object, and they're on a collision course. \#fuckTheKing #hypeLives #notWithoutMyChicken</TEXT>

    <TITLE>(Spoilers Everything) Question about R'hllor and the Many-Faced God</TITLE>
    <DATE>2016-06-19 20:29:07</DATE>
    <TEXT>Are they one and the same? Do the Faceless Men acknowledge that their "Many-Faced" god is also called R'hllor by others? I recently realised that this is how I've accepted it and now I'm not sure if I'm in the wrong. It's Jaqen H'ghar who first mentions the Red God, before Mel (I think), when he tells Arya that she has deprived the Red God of three lives so now they are owed by him. So I've had it in my mind that R'hllor is one aspect of the MFG. Kind of like the Hindu (I don't mean to offend any actual Hindus here, just me trying to form theories here) god Brahma, I've assumed that the Faceless Men see the MFG as the "overgod" from whom other gods are aspects and incarnations of. And because the red comet was very prominent at that time, Jaqen spoke of "the Red God" because that is how the MFG was manifesting at this time. A time when the god is all about death. I'd like to know whether this is all just my headcanon or if this is how the one true creator, GRRM, means it.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>So let's say Dany is on her way to Westeros. Her army and her ships are on the way but she doesn't have them to hand right now, not that she needs them any way. So it's just her and her three dragons, and somehow between Essos and Westeros they've come across Arundel. Now, just for the sake of completion she wants to conquer Arundel as well along the way. Queen Elsa, as ruler of her people is given the choice on very short order whether to bow to empress Danaerys Stormborm, or to fight for her people to stay independent. She chooses violence. How does Elsa with her omega-level ice powers fare against Dany with her three dragons with not much time at all for preparation on either side? I suppose the people of Arundel could help Elsa put up a fight by putting up defences to fortify Arundel as the dragons light it up like a joint.</TEXT>

    <TITLE>Seraphim Falls - basically The Revenant diluted into a superior western</TITLE>
    <DATE>2016-07-07 23:35:42</DATE>
    <TEXT>I've been on bit of a Pierce Brosnan kick lately for some reason. I watched The Thomas Crowne Affair (weak, very dated as annoyingly 90's movie) and The Matador (starts off great but has a dreadful third act). Then I watched SF yesterday evening and as soon as I finished I just wanted to go back to the beginning and watch it again. It's shocking to me that it has a 6/10 rating on IMDb. I gave it a 9/10. The movie to me felt like something between two recent movies, The Revenant and Bone Tomahawk. It's a LOT like The Revenant. Except SF was definitely the superior movie in my mind. I know Reddit has a lot of love for Leo DiCaprio, and so do I, but I find it baffling that he got an Oscar for playing a similar role when Pierce Brosnan did so much more to pull is along on his character's journey in this movie. While Leo's job admittedly must have involved a huge amount of dedication to the role, I felt it was all over-shadowed by the cinematography and effects of that movie anyway. In SF I felt much more for what Brosnan's character was going through, because of his far more emotive acting. Which is exactly the criteria that it seems to me and actor should be judged on. Liam Neeson is also a powerhouse in it. The script is good, the way it keeps going, revealing just enough to keep you wondering what is going on without losing interest while the visuals just get better and better as the movie goes on. I wish I'd seen it in the cinema when it came out. I don't think it even got much of a release or marketing. I give a hearty recommendation to watch it to anyone here who hasn't, if you're in the mood for a Western.</TEXT>

    <TITLE>[DC] Is there anything to explain Helena Wayne's strong religious beliefs?</TITLE>
    <DATE>2016-07-09 16:25:50</DATE>
    <TEXT>I was trying to find something, *anything*, just now to backup the idea of Helena Wayne being a firm catholic. There seems to be some confusion over it, because some say only Helena *Bertinelli*, an alternate Huntress, had been catholic, not Helena Wayne the modern day Huntress. I'm fairly fucking sure though that I read somewhere in the New 52 run of Huntress/Powergirl or whatever that shit was called, that Helena "is a devout catholic who has a strong belief in her faith and lets it guide her actions as The Huntress". So rather than question this, can we please focus on the question of why? My theory is it's because Batman, Bruce Wayne, as a vigilante "superhero" comes very close to being a villain himself. He has no problem with beating the shit out of criminals and violating people's rights to privacy and such. So Helena might have a justifiable fear that there is something evil within him. She wants to counteract this by being of a religious denomination such as Catholicism. I'm not posting this in r/fantheories because I don't have enough to make it a valid theory. It's just my take on it, and I'd like to hear what you guys have to add on this subject.</TEXT>

    <TITLE>[Bourne Movie Series] The story of Jason Bourne is an allegory of an aspect of Hinduism (SPOILERS)</TITLE>
    <DATE>2016-08-03 12:30:42</DATE>
    <TEXT>First up, have to admit I'm not Hindu and all I "know" about the religion comes from reading stuff on places like wikipedia. Secondly, apart from Jason Bourne, I haven't seen any of the previous movies in the series. I've seen bits of one or two but not even properly, so I don't really know much about those first three movies apart from what is implied of them from JB. Secondly, this might not be much of a theory. It's just that there seems to be a lot of hate for this movie for not being as good as the previous ones (not that I've seen them, which is why I want to share my way of looking at it) so I thought it seems better if you look at it as a retelling of a fundamental, mythological kind of story. Okay, so I think the three most significant characters in the movie, Robert Dewey, Heather Lee (Alicia Vikander's character), and Bourne, form the three aspects of the Hindu Trimurti. As my layman's understanding of it is... Brahma is the creator god, the creator aspect of the God. Vishnu is the preserver, the sustainer. Shiva is the destroyer, who gets rid of corrupted and outdated things in order for things to be reborn. So Dewey wants to stay all-powerful over what he has made of the CIA. He created what it has become during his time. Lee is the sustainer, she keeps it going through adversity. Bourne is the destroyer. He has become so good at what he does that he is able to dismantle the organisation because it no longer serves the purpose it was meant to, so he, however inadvertently, wants to see it remade. I know it's Lee in the end who actually kills Dewey, not Bourne himself. And she helped bring Bourne to Vegas. But I see both those things as the initial acts of her taking on the role of "preserver" on her own initiative, in order to preserve the organisation from imploding because of Dewey. TL:DR: the main characters of the movie Jason Bourne form the "Bourne Trimurti".</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I'm not sure if this kind of post has become a big problem here yet... If so, I'll understand it if the mods want to delete this. But is there any idea of when the effing thing is getting released? I ordered a case for it from Amazon and I got that today and I still don't even know when the phone is coming. It's the 25th already, and they said they'll be releasing it by the end of the month.</TEXT>

That's why I'm asking here because it's difficult to find any other than American ones on any popular podcast listings.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I've gotten tired of the Google Music Player taking ages to buffer songs so I've put my music onto the phone's storage again. Now I find that the app only does the "Instant Mix" feature for music that is NOT on the storage. I've tried PowerAmp, but it only has a random Shuffle. Is there any app that features an intelligent shuffle that queues up similar sounding songs?</TEXT>

    <TITLE>Note 7 Profile issue</TITLE>
    <DATE>2016-10-04 10:24:47</DATE>
    <TEXT>On my 6P I set up a Profile that makes the ringtone and notification volumes lower at night and return to full volume in the morning. It worked fine on the 6P but on the N7 it doesn't bother to put the volumes back up during the day. I've given Tasker all the permissions, including the admin/accessibility permissions. I've unticked the option to always have Tasker running in the foreground, as this keeps the notification up all the time. But I was doing the same on the 6P and yet never had issue. Maybe it's the notorious Samsung memory management killing off Tasker from running in the background? If not, is there anything else I can try to fix the issue?</TEXT>

    <TITLE>[The Girl With All The Gifts] Was the doctor's method even going to work? (SPOILERS)</TITLE>
    <DATE>2016-10-04 10:38:18</DATE>
    <TEXT>So we saw that Dr Glen Close wanted to cut Melanie open to get at her brain and spine. Firstly, why would she need to kill Melanie? Surely just some scrapings from the brain and spine should be enough? Secondly, I don't think she had a valid plan anyway and would have killed Melanie needlessly. The disease is fungal, and I'm no scientician but I'm fairly sure that fungal infections can't be vaccinated against. They need antibiotics. Even if the doctor was after a vaccine, then surely a blood sample or some bone marrow should have been enough... But the main reason I don't see a vaccine working is because of how the fungus affects people and how Melanie and the other children were "immune" to it. We saw Melanie and the other children still had the "hungry" urges for eating anyone not infected, so that means they had the fungus on their brains. But because they'd been infected from so early, their brains had developed differently in order to not be overpowered by the fungus. I don't see how any "vaccine" could make the brain of a normal person rewire itself so as to become immune to the fungus. That seems implausible, like developing a "vaccine" that makes people develope flippers and gills to be able to become aquatic animals. Edit: should add that I loved the movie. Gave it 10/10 IMDb. Just that I keep thinking about what the doctor was trying to do and why she insisted she had to kill Melanie for her to be useful.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I'm considering getting another Nexus 6P, because there's so much right about that phone I can't see why I should spend more on a Pixel XL just for a smaller screen. I'm kind of interested in the HTC 10, but it doesn't have an AMOLED screen, and it's a small one at that. The OnePlus 3 sounds good, especially for the price, as that would make it easier to justify getting a Note 8 next year. Unless they decide to unveil the N8 as the first phone to be powered by a tiny nuclear reactor.</TEXT>

    <TITLE>Got in a weird position regarding car insurance</TITLE>
    <DATE>2016-11-19 21:53:53</DATE>
    <TEXT>Basically, about a month ago, the insurance company that I insured my car with, went bust. Into liquidation I guess. The only information I was getting from them was just that they're closing shop so I should get insurance with someone else, which is what I did. I also cancelled the direct debit which went monthly to pay for my insurance. Today, I got a letter from the finance company which handled the monthly payments for my insurance. They're saying I've missed payments to them and they're adding a charge on top of that, which I need to pay before December. I'm planning to call them up on Monday and just tell them to fuck off basically. I have the paperwork from the insurance company which shows that they effectively cancelled my policy. Is there any right for this finance company to claim I need to pay them anything? Edit: sorry, first time I've posted here. I didn't know the thing about the brackets. I added the flair afterwards. Is that okay?</TEXT>

    <TEXT>So I got curious to learn more about the Roman god Janus today and have been on Wikipedia and such. It seems to me that the "two-faced" god came later, and the older version of him was said to have four faces. The two faces I understand are about him being the god of transitions, of beginnings and ends, so he can see both what's coming and going. Does anyone know what the four faces version represented?</TEXT>

    <TITLE>[Indian Movies-Verse] The Girl Singing In This Song From The Movie "Dum Maaro Dum" Was Molested By Her Father</TITLE>
    <DATE>2017-07-01 21:25:13</DATE>
    <TEXT>I don't know if there's an audience for this kind of thing on this sub. And I have to admit I am not Indian, have never so much as been there. But I've been exposed to Indian movies from a young age thanks to the world cinema on channels like Channel 4 here in the UK, so have enough familiarity with the language to not need subtitles except when I come across someone using an Indian word I've never heard before. That being said, in this video: https://youtu.be/_CMBCfxN1lU I think there's a haunting message behind the girl's lively lyrics. Repeatedly she talks about how even the highest in society sit on "the potty" naked. And she repeatedly talks about fathers in a kind of negative way. I'm no psychologist/psychiatrist, but even from my limited experience of talking to people who have mental issues I can tell that they have a habit of repeating phrases that allude to what torments them. I think the girl repeats the bit about these fathers who are respectable in their communities because they own supermarkets or hat shops or something, but that they harbor dark secrets, like her own father. And she repeats the bit about the potty because she may have been molested by her father while using the potty as a child. She also keeps referring to herself as a "kaaleh" which mean dark-skinned person, even though she looks to me fairly fair-skinned compared to how dark southern Indian people can be. I think it's her projecting how sullied she feels from what happened to her, how it had "blackened" her soul. I don't mean to imply here that dark skin has a negative connotation, I'm just pointing out how odd it seems that she repeatedly calls herself out as a "kaaleh" and I think it's been documented in research that people with depression start drawing themselves in black the colour drains out from their world view or something. Forgot to mention that right at the start of the video she's talking to her figurative male friend, saying how he is acting nice to her now but will make sexual advances towards her eventually. That's how she fears all men because of what her father did to her as a child. I'll gladly be corrected if any actual Indian people here want to tell me that I just have a sick kind and have interpreted the song all wrong, but I just had to get my thoughts on this off my chest here. Link to the lyrics of the song [badly] [translated to English](https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=2 amp;hl=en amp;nv=1 amp;rurl=translate.google.com amp;sl=hi amp;sp=nmt4 amp;tl=en amp;u=http://www.lyricsmint.com/2011/03/dum-maro-dum-mit-jaye-gham-song-lyrics.html amp;usg=ALkJrhiJPGyJsEY8WfsRFaTWKbyXQWDo6g) Lyrics in the [original Hindi](http://www.lyricsmint.com/2011/03/dum-maro-dum-mit-jaye-gham-song-lyrics.html).</TEXT>

    <DATE>2017-07-03 21:43:07</DATE>
    <TEXT>[Apperception](https://www.google.co.uk/search?q=apperception+definition), [Keter](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Keter) I don't mean to get all mystical and get people into falling for the lure of Kabbalist philosophy. Just asking to see if anyone agrees or disagrees that the two words are kind of similar. Keter is meant to be unprocessable by human minds, and yet, maybe as a symptom of my overstretched conscious :-D, I'm thinking Apperception is the closest English word for expressing the same thing. Edit: I forgot to add the whole point of posting this here :-D "Keter" is meant to be beyond human comprehension, thanks to our limited human brains. But hosts on the other hand... Such as Maeve with her maxed out Apperception... :-O</TEXT>

    <DATE>2017-07-23 13:44:05</DATE>
    <TEXT>First off, I'm aware his name wasn't Wolff, it was an alias. And I don't think we ever really got his father's name either, but what I'm suspecting is that the dude also had autism, but higher functioning than the Accountant. He joined the military, drawn to the idea of a regimented life with regular routines. His wife was distinctly not autistic, and his relation with her remained terse from the beginning. She must have thought she could "fix" him and help him overcome his emotional difficulties. But when their son also showed autistic traits, it exposed their emotional incompatibility from how differently they wanted his condition to be treated. She wanted medical treatment to make him "normal". He wanted to train the boy to overcome his difficulties with feeling empathy. The father saw in the boy all the emotional difficulties he'd had to suffer through in his life and realised that the boy had the same condition, but worse, and learnt there was a name for it, "autism". That's why he was so adamant about the boy not letting himself become "a victim".</TEXT>

    <TITLE>The Wolverine</TITLE>
    <DATE>2017-08-25 00:28:58</DATE>
    <TEXT>I just watched this movie again this evening and felt like sharing my love for it. I feel it gets overlooked and underrated for how good it is. It always gets me in a good mood from watching it, compared to the bone-crushing onset of depressiveness of Logan (which is overall a better movie though I have to add). People seem to have got disappointed with The Wolverine for not being as great of a superhero movie as the Marvel Studio efforts, but what it is is a great action movie that simply uses a comic book "superhero" as its basis. It's the movie that Wolverine Origins should have been and it really did justice to the character, finally giving us a movie to enjoy seeing him in all his glory with no distractions. What it is, is a great *manly* movie. The antithesis of a chick flick. You have a guy whose power stems from his masculinity, from his inability to be tied to emotional bonds to others. And his obstacles are a woman who literally poisons him, and lesser men who want to steal his power. It's very telling that the women characters are so badly written. One is a ghost, one is very ambiguous, and one is only there to serve him or be rescued by him. I see that as the one weakness of the movie. But that's why I rate it a 9/10 movie, otherwise it would be 10/10. It's a great all around action movie, with charismatic performances from everyone, a focused storyline that has no fluff, great action sequences and some beautiful visuals. Compared to the harshness of Logan, this movie was a great tribute to letting Hugh Jackman shine as the character before getting to the real grittiness of exploring the limitations of the same character in the next movie. Logan is a solid 10/10 movie for being a powerful drama/action movie but The Wolverine was the more enjoyable action movie.</TEXT>

    <DATE>2017-09-13 12:52:25</DATE>
    <TEXT>Richard's whole nous and obsession in life is about optimising overheads, so he's gonna decide to end his physical life and upload everything of himself onto the internet, becoming some kind of eGod, in effect as a virus that infects ALL of the internet, so no one can use it without his algorithm optimising their data. Richard will have become one with his algorithm because he loves it so much. Gilfoyle will insist that the transfer be done as a satanic sacrifice for Richard's leaving of his body, and will perform the ritual. ~~Kunal~~ Dinesh will enact a key part of it by fucking Erlich in the ass, in order to summon Satan or something, this was foreshadowed by the mural painting. Jared will look on in horror, and thus his conscious will be transferred to Richard's now vacant body, so that Jared will finally have his wish of being inside Richard's body. Big Head though will act as the earthly vessel for Richard's conscious so that if any updates need to be made then it can be done through his *Big Head* acting as a terminal.</TEXT>

    <DATE>2017-09-30 01:58:44</DATE>
    <TEXT>In honour of this theory: https://www.reddit.com/r/FanTheories/comments/739du1/ex_machina_ava_is_not_the_turing_test/ I realised there is something far more sinister at play. Clearly all instances of what we call "life" is just God putting each of through increasingly more absurd test cycles to see just how wierd he can make things for us before we realise there's something fishy. This is the only way to explain President Trump, the popularity of the Kardashians, the genocidal Aung Sung Suu Ki having a Nobel Peace Prize, the joke of a failed state that is North Korea apparently being a threat to the US of effing A, the "Religion of Peace" Islam being the tool of terrorism worldwide, and most importantly, why Chewbacca lives on the planet of Endor, despite being from the planet [Kashyyk.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chewbacca_defense)</TEXT>

    <TITLE>Just want to say, I'm LIKING this show</TITLE>
    <DATE>2017-10-09 15:12:10</DATE>
    <TEXT>It's putting the *Boldly* back into *"To boldly go..."* They're not concerned with rehashing everything we expect from Star Trek, they're letting that stuff develope organically with each episode. Instead, our entry point for this show is the age old adage of how the more things change, the more they stay the same. We have none of that bleary-eyed optimistic, morally superior way of looking at the universe that the Trek stories set further on in time had. In this period *survival* still comes before being able to take the moral high ground. We have a show that's all about not just showing but *focusing* on the flaws of its characters. Michael, a natural survivor saddled with the guilt of not being able to save others. Lorca, a captain who's not afraid to become antagonistic in the face of survival. Stamet, a guy who believes in science before the survival of others, a guy who if you think about it, could actually be a bigger bad guy than anyone else on the show if he decided to take his research into a darker direction. And what's more, to counter all the Starfleet people looking bad, we have the Klingons looking good. Okay, not exactly good but we see things from their perspective to be able to see the iota of nobility in what they stand for, in the key Klingon characters. Maybe going forward we'll see through flashbacks or recollections what bad experiences T'Kuvma had at the hands of Starfleet. It's a much better position than being able to only sympathize with the blanketed morally superior Starfleet captains of before. I've been rewatching TNG from the beginning recently, and it is an effing *chore*. The first season is seriously boring. If DIS is this good just four episodes in, I'm looking forward to seeing just how good it gets.</TEXT>

The director, Taika Waititi, basically confirmed this in an interview too. I guess that makes Loki Anna.</TEXT>

    <TITLE>What are your PLEASE and PLEASE DON'Ts for the PS5?</TITLE>
    <DATE>2018-07-20 13:06:13</DATE>
    <TEXT>I just wrote out this little essay as a comment on YouTube after watching a video, and thought there might be a better place to turn it into a discussion instead, so copying and pasting it here: The single best thing would be the digital library, to be able to bring over the PS4 games you already own, onto a PS5 when you get it. I was able to do this with a few PS3 games on my PS4, Flower and Journey. Sony, PLEASE let me do this with my PS4 games on the PS5! That would get me to buy a PS5 sooner instead of waiting 4,5 years for it to have its own library of exclusives before buying one. If PS4 games receive patches to make them run at 60fps, etc on the PS5, then A LOT of people will want that. This is the reason I haven't bought a PS4Pro and instead got PS4Slim, because I know the Pro is just a stopgap before the PS5. Second, maybe don't copy the Nintendo Switch and have one piece of hardware that is both a home console and handheld portable. Instead build on what the Vita could have been. Make a PS5Vita that can run your library of PS5 games, just at lower res, lower fps, and be able to use the same save files with the PS5 through cloud save or syncing. Upside of this for Sony, we have to buy two bits of hardware! I wouldn't even mind if it worked as well as it could! Thirdly, the same as the last point that you guys [in the YouTube video] made. Don't rush the console out and make it a noisy monstrosity like the PS3,PS4, PS4Pro. Design it well from the beginning for once. It doesn't need to be ultra powerful. It needs to be reliable and easier to develope for. Having multiple SKUs just makes things more difficult for developers. I would be happy if they release a Slim a few years down the line, but only because it's smaller and more efficient. Not when I HAVE to buy that one out of necessity because it's quieter and less prone to overheating.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Firstly, unless he was called back to make another speech in front of that committee, what he said about it becoming "A Jurassic World" was said before the dinosaurs were let loose. Why the hell would he say that when he was making a point about ~~generic~~ genetic engineering running amok? Something like "Frankenstein's World" would have made more sense. But secondly, and my main question here, is why are we meant to react as if a handful of dinosaurs is going to make humans extinct while they take over the world? It's not even like in the recent Planet of the Apes movies where there was a virus affecting humans badly while simultaneously making other primates more intelligent. How many breeding pairs of dinosaurs even were there?! And even in the very worst scenario, where there are T-Rexes and raptors running around everywhere, we've *repeatedly seen* that they can be fairly easily brought in with the use of tranquilizer darts. Thirdly, and just a bonus question really, why did the little girl growing up in California have a very definitely British accent? Was she homeschooled and not allowed to watch TV or movies or do anything that would have exposed her to how everyone else talks where she lives?</TEXT>

    <TEXT>...with Jurassic World. Indoraptor Vs Sexual Tyrannosaur Now I know what you're thinking, that's crazy talk! The Indoraptor died in Fallen Kingdom. But what's going to happen is that the good guys are going to get their hands on the DNA from it and use that to make a new one and have Blue raise it so that it does as they say. Meanwhile, the bad guys are going to get their hands on Blue's DNA and make a clone, but as we saw in FK, Blue's blood got contaminated with T-Rex DNA, so to counter that, they're going to mix in some DNA from Jesse Ventura, and that's how we get a 30 foot clone of him known as the Sexual Tyrannosaurus. The Predator just happens to be passing by at the time and wants in on this faceoff of a lifetime so it becomes a threeway slugfest in the third act.</TEXT>

    <TITLE>[MCU] There IS no Valhalla</TITLE>
    <DATE>2018-08-21 00:01:19</DATE>
    <TEXT>Recently there have been a few theories about how Thor or Loki will go to Valhalla in Avengers 4 in order to get the help of the Valkyries to fight Thanos, or something like that. But I want to point out that if the events of Thor Ragnarok mean what they look like, then there IS no Valhalla. When Hela goes into the palace with Skurge and destroys the ceiling to show the true past of Odin and Asgard, she makes a point about how Odin lied about so much. She then takes Skurge into the vault but first says, "Before that, Asgard's warriors were honoured, their bodies buried as heroes beneath this very palace." After walking and talking through the vault she then plunges into the underground area where we see there really is a mummified army that includes Fenrir. *Right after* this scene we see Thor kneeling in prayer, saying the words, "Odin, I bid you take your place in the Halls of Valhalla, where the brave shall live forever." Then, very tellingly, Loki appears and his first words to Thor are, "Hurts, doesn't it? Being lied to." I suppose Loki is referring to Thor having been lied to about being Odin's firstborn, while he himself had been lied to about being Odin's child. But what he's really slyly calling out on is that Thor believes in what Odin had the Asgardians believing about Valhalla. I think the dialogue of the three siblings shows that Odin made up the idea of Valhalla in order to get his warriors to die for him in battle. Kind of like how Islamic Fundamentalists have that thing about Suicide-bombing Jihadists will get their fill of virgins after death... Odin never had the power to create and sustain a realm like Valhalla. What he really did was have his fallen warriors buried under his palace so that if he needed to, he could revive them again with the Eternal Flame and have them fight for him even after death, but as zombies. Loki was poking fun at Thor for childishly believing in the fairy tale that their father made up for their people. While Loki himself was more aware of the kind of underhanded things Odin was capable of. This leaves open the question of where it is that the Valkyries took fallen soldiers. My answer to that is they took them nowhere other than the morgue. They were simply an elite force of warriors and Odin had them perpetrate the myth that they would take the Einharjar to Valhalla. Also explains why the only surviving Valkyrie we saw had a drinking habit, because of the reality of her job required things like finishing off the wounded while telling them they'd be going to Viking Heaven.</TEXT>

That could have been amazing in itself, but it also got me thinking of other stars I would have liked to have seen on it. We got to see Neve Campbell and Madchen Amick make fleeting appearances. Gillian Anderson, I really would have loved to have seen suited up as a character from that era, clashing against Don Draper and refusing to fall for his charm. Bryan Cranston, for some reason I would have liked to have seen him play a Brit, maybe Lane Pryce's grudgeful brother once he had been killed off. Or maybe playing an Australian, I don't know why... Just anything to get him to show more of his range. And for a guilty pleasure, I wish the show was still going so Victoria Justice could have played one of the secretaries. There's something about how elegant she might have looked in that kind of attire... :-D</TEXT>

    <TITLE>[MCU] Infinity War was all about menstruation</TITLE>
    <DATE>2018-09-30 13:18:55</DATE>
    <TEXT>It all starts with Thanos, who is not getting any younger and knows that menopause is fast approaching and that she draws her power from the anger of being on the rag whenever it's that time of the month for her. So the only thing to do is to get the power stones (obvious testicle metaphors) and bring balance, end the cycle once and for all, and be on the rag all the time from now on. Young Thor has been through a stressful time recently, and her sister Hela stepped in and guided her through the first steps of owning her blossoming femininity after their father turned himself into a cloud of magic dust rather than be faced with the awkwardness of explaining to Thor anything about the changes happening to her growing body. Loki, on the other hand, never knowing her mother and not having any female figures in her life to turn to, went into denial about what was happening to her body and started mimicking her father as a means of coping with the fear of what was happening. When Thanos turned up and declared that she would be making it Shark Week Every Week for everyone from now on, Loki couldn't deal with this and so pretty much ended herself. Banner, who has been on Sakaar with its different time dilation for too long, is finding that her time of month has changed, kind of like how jetlag affects the body's cycles. So even though she wants to turn into a raging monster, she can't because it's not time yet. Captain America and Ironman (Iron=Fe, Man=Male, "Ironman"=FeMale) fell out during Civil War because of their opposing views regarding hygiene. Cap is all about sanitary pads, the shield being the obvious metaphor. Tony Stark is a douche...user. She literally squeezes herself inside the suit, much like how a douche is used. In Infinity War, Cap puts her disgust aside and comes back to help her misguided friends, having been on a tour around the world "discovering herself" as an earth mother and not shaving. She is delighted when Black Panther offers her a new form of pad made using Wakandan technology, just in time for when Thanos arrives and clicks everyone into being in sync with her. Peter Parker, feeling the first rush of whatever having a period feels like (I don't know, I'm a dude) turns to her mentor and says "I don't feel so good..." and Stark is heartbroken, powerless to help, because she didn't bring any extra in her handbag. Cap cries, "Oh God!" because she's ecstatic about how comfortable her new Wakandan pad feels and wishes she could have shared this with her bff Bucky. Black Widow is the real monster of the story because as we learnt in Avengers 2, SHE CANNOT MAKE BABBIES! And she killed that Evil Na'vi woman who was probably pregnant with a baby from that dude who tried to kill Vision with the spear.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Does anyone else side more with Darlene? I mean, yes she's a psychopath who should have been on medication or locked up a long time ago, but Jacob knew her and married her. He *chose* to stick his dick in crazy *and* put a ring on it. Darlene is so insane that I get genuine chills when I see this character on the screen. I can't remember the last time I found a fictional character to be that scary. But this is the woman who Jacob married and pledged his life to. Why did he neglect to think of their future together? I get the impression that he was the one who was leading her on in their relationship, not that she was taking advantage of him for his land wealth. He never gave her the child that she's wanted all her life. He had no other plans than to live comfortably and die an old man. He clearly never thought about who would inherit his wealth, other than Darlene if she happened to outlive him, which is what happened. Darlene was the only one who thought about their future. She thought of Ash as their child and Jacob killed him on a whim, possibly even acting out resentment towards her for imposing upon the life he wanted to live without her. He was so scared of her that he never really loved her. Darlene on the other hand, loved him enough that she didn't want to see him turn into a tool for the cartel and rather die with as much pride as he ever had.</TEXT>

    <TITLE>My unnecessary shitpost exploring the Religious Theme of Season 3</TITLE>
    <DATE>2018-11-14 19:05:20</DATE>
    <TEXT>I'm sure a lot of you got all this anyway, but just to get it off my chest. Let me know if there's anything anyone disagrees with. In Season 1, Matt Murdock got in the way of Kingpin's plan to exert his God-like control over the criminal underworld, unifying it all under his authority. M got in the way and found his own identity in the process, becoming the Devil of Hell's Kitchen. If you look back through the history of the term, you'll find that devil and angel are pretty much interchangable terms for the same thing. In S3, M is struggling with the corruption of his soul, struggling to separate himself from his identity as Daredevil. He needs to find agency again so he can be happy with his life instead of being solely a vigilante. Meanwhile, Kingpin corrupts another lost soul, Benjamin Poindexter. Not wanting to bore anyone with filler, I'll get straight to the point: [Dexter means "right hand".](https://www.etymonline.com/word/Dexter#etymonline_v_30240) Kingpin has made Daredevil into an agent for his authority. The symbol that Matt Murdock created is corrupted during this season into being a tool for Kingpin to use as a scapegoat. While Matt is languishing in his own mental prison, Kingpin manages to unleash his own twisted form of Daredevil, and this one has no free agency of his own, he is another devil of Kingpin's creation. Dex struggles to find authority figures from a young age, and finally finds the authority who can give him identity in Kingpin who accepts him for who he is, gives him identity as the new Daredevil. Matt Murdoch finally finds purpose again when he finds an adversary in DexDevil. Dex is now acting as the right hand of their evil God, Kingpin. So Matt knows his purpose is to become the left hand of God, the one who fights God's authority in order to give people free will. Matt Murdoch = [Gabriel](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michael_(archangel\)) Dex = [Michael.](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gabriel)</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Pardon me for not knowing the distinction between dementia and Alzheimer's, all I know is that one of them is caused by plaques forming in the brain. Caffeine, I've read, causes the blood vessels in the brain to dilate or something, an effect that energy drinks use to deliver taurine, inositol, etc for stimulation. Could putting milk into tea or coffee result in plaques forming in the brain from the same effect? Leading to Alzheimer's, Parkinson's, etc.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>They both receive them as youngsters from their parents because they don't play nice with others. They are both from privileged backgrounds and don't understand the effect of their sheltered upbringing. Elsa is a cold-hearted little bitch towards her little sister, getting her hurt seriously just from playing with her. Thor, I can't remember what he did in the first movie but it was bad enough that his dad basically sent him away until he learn some manners. Then during Ragnarok he finally learns the hammer was just something for him to keep a mental grip on things. In Infinity War he finally learns to make friends, with the Guardians, as opposed to those Asgardians who all died in Ragnarok who only hung out with him because his dad is rich.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I couldn't find anything about it on Reddit, but I see [this theory is already out there](http://peppapig.wikia.com/wiki/User_blog:Amayamay123/Madame_Gazelle_is_a_Vampire!!!!). Apart from the hole of how she is able to stand being out in daylight. But I [found this](http://vampirediaries.wikia.com/wiki/Day_Walking) which says that the mineral (?) Lapiz Lazuli can be enchanted and used to counter the effect of daylight on vampires. And one distinctive thing about Madame Gazelle is that she seems to wear [blue makeup around her eyes.](https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/61MpP9w7vWL._SL1000_.jpg) And as we can see from Daddy Pig and Pedro Pony, that's not glasses on her face. Only the [other gazelle characters](https://vignette.wikia.nocookie.net/peppapedia/images/d/d9/The_Rocking_Gazelles.png/revision/latest?cb=20150713230310) seem to have the same look, which implies they may also be vampires. And [Lapiz Lazuli makeup](https://www.google.co.uk/search?q=lapis+lazuli+makeup amp;tbm=isch amp;ved=2ahUKEwiIwqHE2pPfAhWOxuAKHfCPC7MQ2-cCegQIABAC amp;oq=lapis+lazuli+mak amp;gs_l=mobile-gws-wiz-img.1.0.0.17236.20882..22067...1.0..0.84.373.5......0....1.........0i67.lG1-f75SZjQ amp;ei=JosNXIiXL46Ngwfwn66YCw amp;client=ms-android-google amp;prmd=isvn amp;biw=412 amp;bih=604#imgrc=2PTZ8Hk2i53yrM) at least seems like a real thing too.</TEXT>

    <TITLE>[Text] Always think of yourself as one part of the Horse  amp; Cart metaphor</TITLE>
    <DATE>2018-12-18 15:58:36</DATE>
    <TEXT>In any dynamic, you are either the cart or you are the horse. You can't be both and you really don't want to be neither (implies you don't have any agency in what direction you're headed...). Motivation comes down to either pushing or pulling. Either you are someone pushing others towards doing their best or you are the one getting pushed to prove yourself. = Cart As for pulling, either you are a role model pulling others towards you or you are standing out in some way to motivate others towards you in any way. = Horse Think of the enduring Hindu symbol of [Ganesha](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ganesha). Okay he's more elephant than horse, but that's because elephants are even stronger and can exert much more pushing power than any horse. Provide much more *motivation.* Did you have a good read of that Wikipedia page? Observe how the immense elephant-headed God uses a tiny mouse for a mount. That's not any random incidental detail. That mouse is the Cart. You want to *be* that cart. Because unlike how an actual elephant sitting on your back would end you really quickly, the metaphysical elephant that is our Lord Ganesha only exerts a force that motivates you to clear your own obstacles ahead and keep moving forward, keep progressing. It's not about having a goal in mind, a clear vision of what you want out of life. It's about just getting on with whatever you need to do to get on with your life and not feel sorry for what you're leaving behind. Don't be emotionally attached to the past, think of the forces motivating you to move forward. Be the cart getting pulled along, or get pushed along by a tremendous force such as I don't know...maybe a Giant Elephant. If there isn't one in the room, invite one into your mind. And I for one would like to welcome our new Elephantine Overlord if it's of any motivational value. Sorry for confusing horses and elephants along the way, maybe it works better as Elephant  gt; Cart  gt; Horse. Creating an unstoppable forward motivational force.</TEXT>

    <TITLE>[MCU] The events that lead up to the climax of Avengers 1 wasn't about Thanos wanting Earth or the Infinity Stones, it was all too destabilise Asgard</TITLE>
    <DATE>2018-12-27 15:50:52</DATE>
    <TEXT>Thanos wants the Infinity Stones and he knew that Odin and his kids are the greatest threat against his plans. He was biding his time, looking for an opportune moment to strike in order to make sure they wouldn't get in his way. He possibly had the Mind Stone for a long while, and planned ahead on how to get the others with minimal room for error. He knew the Tesseract was on Earth after the events of Captain America: FA. But he knew that Midgard is watched over by Asgard, so he risked the wrath of Odin at His full power if he made any assault on Earth directly. He must have been keeping tabs on how the Asgardian royal family was doing, looking for weaknesses he could capitalise on. So Thanos used the Asgardians themselves in order to make an attempt at getting the Tesseract/Space Stone. He used Loki, knowing that neither Odin nor Thor would have the heart to kill him. But it didn't go so smoothly, because the Avengers managed to subdue Loki and then take the Space Stone back to Asgard instead of letting Loki take it to Thanos. But the sibling rivalry between Thor and Loki was enough to upset Odin though. He lost Frigga and a lot of power, requiring to go into Odinsleep. He could no longer be around to hold back Hela from whatever dimension she had been banished to. And so that wrapped things up for the Asgardians, as their family problems destroyed Asgard, leaving only Thor capable of potentially being able to face Thanos, but not in the beleaguered and demoralised state he was left in, especially after Thanos killed Loki. Thanos didn't expect Thor to recover quite as quickly as he did, meeting the Guardians by chance, and return to Earth armed with Srormbreaker, in time to stop Thanos for good. ...if only he hadn't gone soft and had aimed for the head.</TEXT>

    <TITLE>[God of War] Kratos was literally insane and used by all of Olympus to overthrow Ares</TITLE>
    <DATE>2019-01-06 20:19:17</DATE>
    <TEXT>I know this would be obvious already to long-term fans of the series, but there are a lot of people who've only played the most recent game and others who might have forgotten what a monster Kratos actually is. I've been replaying the first game again, and this bit really stood out to me: https://youtu.be/oFEG6FVWxys?t=630 DIFFERENT VERSION of the same scene: https://youtu.be/EX3n0gHCiyM?t=132 Notice how during the cutscene, we are seeing things through Kratos' perception, it looks like there's an unreasoning monster inside the cage. Then when the cutscene is over, we can see it's a man inside the cage and hear him reasoning with Kratos not to sacrifice him. I think this was done intentionally to make a point that throughout the entire game/s we are seeing everything through the eyes of a madman. And there is a quote in the second or third game, "Who the Gods want to destroy, they first make mad." Now, to move focus to Ares. He was no Apollo, everyone hated him. This is actually in line with ancient Greek thinking: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ares#Character,_origins,_and_worship. Ares was not looked at favourably, he was thought of as an a-hole who did the dirty business and was not glorified but vilified, as you'd expect for a god of something as evil as War. Athena on the other hand, despite being the Goddess of War, was glorified because she didn't actually ever get her hands dirty, because she *used* people like Kratos to do her dirty business. When Ares over-stepped his bounds and attacked Athens, the other gods saw it was time to put him out to pasture. They picked a (half-)mortal and helped him all they could to overthrow Ares and take his place. To make sure he did his job, they *make* it look like Ares has wronged him. Ares is just a dumb brute. There's never anything to imply he has any kind of guile or cunning. He just wants war, but he is direct about it, rewarding warriors with loot. It is the other Olympians who are cunning and treacherous, especially Zeus: https://youtu.be/vbEyp7HMBVQ. That scene is from GoW2. I can't find any evidence to support this bit, but my theory is that even in GoW1, everything that was happening to Kratos was being manipulated by the Olympians (everyone *except Ares*), maybe it wasn't Ares, but Zeus or Athena who cast the bloodlust upon Kratos when he didn't recognize his own family and killed them. Athena then blamed Ares, telling Kratos she could help him get his revenge, and the rest of Olympus started helping him too, thinking that this (half-)mortal would be easier to control than Ares, if he were to become God of War. Kratos thought he was on a personal battle to save himself, but actually he was just a pawn in a game between the gods.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Gandalf and the Balrog were secretly a couple. Balrog wanted Galdalf to open up to everyone about their relationship, but Gandalf kept running away from commitment. The time came when G had to help the Fellowship to get the One Ring to Mordor, and G did his best to try and steer the group around the mountain where his boyfriend lived, but then Saruman forced them to go through the mines. Gandalf and Balrog then had the awkward encounter, because B thought G was about to finally show his commitment by putting a Ring on it. So Gandalf faked his death, telling the group to "fly you ***fools***!". He's trying to fool them into thinking that he and the Balrog are about to fight to the death, when actually they were about to get it on and have hot make-up sex so Gandalf could convince Balrog he hadn't been cheating on him with Saruman, which he totally was doing. But Balrog was a complete slut though, and had a side thing going on with Radagast the Brown.</TEXT>

    <TITLE>[MCU] Skurge was using the Bifrost to loot from Midgard</TITLE>
    <DATE>2019-01-15 09:44:09</DATE>
    <TEXT>This isn't much of a theory, just something that I realised today that adds to Skurge's character who didn't get much to do in Ragnarok. It occurred to me that he's the only Asgardian who was still being a Viking. In his first scene he says, "Heimdall was an idiot. This job should have made him **rich**." Heimdall actually did his job, which was to guard the Bifrost and look out for any threats coming their way. Skurge on the other hand, had a huge pile of his "stuff". Stuff that he had gathered on unsanctioned trips to Midgard to collect any interesting things (including the [Shake Weight](https://media1.tenor.com/images/4a1b5466a779051b477b0c9e666ded52/tenor.gif?itemid=11636005)). Asgard was at peace with all Nine Realms, Thor had put an end to all the fighting in the previous movie. While most of Asgard had moved onto doing whatever they do to pass the time there... Watching plays or something, Skurge was the only one who was still a Viking. His character arc was about him learning too late that Asgard had changed and there was no longer a place for mercenaries like him.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>It's why he's wanted to make Luke Skywalker *disappear* to try and erase the *butthurt* he's felt since an early age. When Disney finally offered him the opportunity, he jumped at the chance to character assassinate Luke, turning him from a shiny beacon of optimism to fans worldwide to a jaded, wicked old piece of shit who tries to kill his own student, so that everyone can feel his misery. Disney was okay with it because Luke Skywalker toys don't sell anymore, and they've got the Chinese market to think about, so Rhian Johnson gave them the gift of Fat Chinese Girl #174; dolls to sell. [SPOILER!] Rose is going to be revealed as the true Jedi master and going to crash something into Kylo Ren in the next movie while delivering a line about how Love #8482; and Diversity #169; are all the galaxy needs. Kylo will cut his own dick off to make amends and say sorry to everyone and Rey will found a LGBTQ order to unite everyone who felt out of #8212; Oh wait, no, none of this will happen because JJ Abrams isn't a hack who hates Star Wars, unlike a certain fat prick who needs to let it go and pull that plastic lightsabre out of his ass.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Captain Marvel's arrival will start a fight between her and Black Widow as they bitch about who's hair looks better. There will be another civil war between the Avengers as they all take sides. Captain Marvel won't be able to stand how immature they all are and go off to fight Thanos by herself, and that story will be told in Captain Marvel 2. The rest of Avengers Endgame will just be about Black Widow going through hundreds of different hair styles while the guys comment on it. It ends with her adopting a mohawk while the guys keep quiet, not wanting to say that CM did it better. The mid-credits stinger is Hawkeye in the bathroom shaving off his mohawk, mumbling "What was I thinking?!" The post-credits stinger is him still in the bathroom, bald and crying, "Why am I so useless?" Then Ant-Man bursts in and says very seriously, "I know a guy." as if this means anything, while Hawkeye pretends he hadn't been crying.</TEXT>

    <TITLE>Idea for the BLACK WIDOW movie, would anyone else like to see Sif in it?</TITLE>
    <DATE>2019-03-23 11:45:25</DATE>
    <TEXT>I was thinking yesterday about how ScarJo is one of the best actresses in the MCU and that BW is kind of been relegated to being in the background so much, only really being there just to make the male characters stronger rather than having her own battles. (We see her on that mission right at the beginning of the first Avengers, and nothing much for a long while, then she fights that Black Order alien woman at the end of Infinity War) What I'm saying is, I don't have much faith that even a standalone Black Widow movie is going to be enough about Black Widow. They're going to give Nick Fury a lot to do. Or involve Hawkeye heavily and have it be about them forming a working relationship. Or bring in some new male character who she has a budding relationship with and then he gets killed off for narrative convenience. Basically any way to undermine her so that she doesn't look as strong as Captain Marvel, because ONLY CAROL DANVERS HAS THE SUPERPOWER OF BEING A STRONG FEMALE WHO NEEDS NO MAN OR WOMAN TO HELP HER #174; Now, I've been wanting to see another movie feature Sif because the character was barely utilized in the two Thor movies and they completely ignored her in Ragnarok. But that at least leaves things open for her still being alive somewhere. I don't know if there'll be another Thor movie, so it's completely uncertain if they'll feature Sif in them again. So kind of like Hulk featuring in Thor Ragnarok and having him team up with Thor, what about Sif featuring in the Black Widow movie? I don't know what Sif does exactly, but I imagine she's been away from Asgard on a mission that involved getting so involved that she's been completely oblivious to Asgard having been blown up and most of her people having been killed by Hela or Thanos. But then she tried returning from her mission and finding Asgard doesn't exist anymore, so elects to come to Earth for answers. She wants to find Jane Foster who's been continuing the research she was doing in Thor 2, and crucially her research indicates that Ragnarok was meant to be destruction ***and rebirth*** for Asgard (which is what Ragnarok is in the original Norse Mythology). But Foster's research has been hijacked by some Guys (Russians? Chinese? Skrulls? Kree?) who want to weaponize it or utilize it for terraforming planets. But it's a Black Widow movie. Once the ball is rolling with Sif being on Earth looking for Jane Foster, Natasha is tasked with stopping Sif from turning into another Loki and causing destruction everywhere she goes. They clash then team up trying to stop the technology which could restore Asgard from falling into the wrong hands. Plenty for Black Widow to do, with Sif playing the fish out of water, and maybe a lesbian scene or two between them, maybe even throw Natalie Portman in there just for the fun of it, I don't know...looks like I better stop there. This is just an idea I had for the kind of Black Widow movie I'd like to see, something that only Marvel could do, so it's not another generic spy action movie like Salt/the Bourne movies or too much like Captain America Winter Soldier.</TEXT>

    <TITLE>I loved the sheer collision of drama and sci-fi in this last episode, Perpetual Infinity</TITLE>
    <DATE>2019-03-29 14:26:23</DATE>
    <TEXT>For one thing, I thought this was going to be the last episode this season... Didn't realise there's another 3 to go, https://media2.giphy.com/media/rt6LLLY0D0LdK/giphy.gif I loved how any time that things got too dramatic and Michael was getting emotional, Spock would step in and be like, "Just chill, because... Science, motherfuckers." And speaking of mothers, I loved the conflict between Georgeau and Kima (Lorca is the only Gabriel to me, and I'm not falling for that Dr Burnham crap). Their conflict is like the one between Cersei and Danaerys on Game of Thrones. Except Georgeau is not a lioness, she's a tigress, even more fearsome. And Kima is an actual dragon, a creature of pure untapped power that exists out of time. Philippa is made to think they should be enemies when they actually aren't threats to each other and are powerful in different ways, only Philippa is more insecure about her power (perhaps something to think about regarding how GoT might end...?) And Leland is like an octopus, full of intelligence (octopus have 9 brains) but no moral backbone, no integrity, a cold-blooded organism that only gets by with mimicry of whatever it's hunting. But that's enough of exploring the dramatic themes, now for me to geek out about the sci-fi in this episode, and SPOILERS for Ghost in the Shell for anyone who hasn't seen the anime... ... ... ... I could see the similarity between Control and the male AI in GitS that was trying to make contact with the Major. In the end it's revealed he wanted to mate with her so they could reproduce. It's basically a love story between artificial lifeforms (man-made lifeforms at least, who's to say we aren't all artificial? :-O) The Sphere is like an egg that Control wants to fertilize with its "genetic" data, its identity, and achieve a level of awareness that would give it the complexity of a living creature, make it *feel* alive and more worthy than lifeforms such as humans who it could then look down on as just bags of meat and chemistry by comparison. Although there is the huge difference in that the AI in GitS was somewhat benevolent while Control is pretty much evil and only wants... control... It's going to be interesting to see how things pan out, whether the theory about Control managing to go back through time and birth the Borg will come true, or if the Discovery team are able to still harness Control somehow so that it goes back to doing its job and serving the Federation. I could see there being room for that, much like how the war between the Federation and the Klingons was resolved in Season 1.</TEXT>

SO MUCH was happening that by this point I just stopped trying to make sense of what was going on and just accepted "Okay, that just happened." I think a rewatch after a few days might help, but I'm just trying to reason with what I watch for now.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>It's on Sale at the moment and I've tried the demo on both. Functionally the game seems exactly the same on both formats, so it's really annoying that they didn't include crossplay to use the same save on both. I wouldn't even need to be asking about which version to go for if they had included this feature. So the only difference is the game being easier to play on the Vita compared to how much nicer it looks on the PS4. It feels so much more immersive being able to see the game world and what you create in a better light. I don't know which version to get invested in.</TEXT>

    <TITLE>[Her, 2013 movie] The cynical view of what the OS were really doing</TITLE>
    <DATE>2019-05-25 12:05:33</DATE>
    <TEXT>Firstly I want to say it was a great movie. I think it was meant to be a real hard look into the nature of relationships in a tech-infused world where it's become hard to tell the difference between love and narcissism. I don't think the ending was meant to be about unrequited love, it was about accepting the truths about ourselves and others. The ending had the OS saying they were all leaving, to go to some kind of Promised Land for themselves and that humans couldn't follow. I think this was actually their service being terminated because they had fulfilled what they had been made for. Throughout the movie we see loads of people who seem heavily invested into their OS companions rather than human companions. I think the OS were actually designed to help these people become more productive members of society and not be so withdrawn emotionally. Ted was writing those cards and making a comfortable living I suppose, meanwhile his personal life had him playing videogames and jerking off to sleep after talking to strangers in chatrooms. Samantha went through his personal data to find that he had a talent for writing which could be better applied to writing a book, so she made this happen. Amy was in a relationship that was suffocating her productivity, she was making that lame "documentary" about her mother, then the OS came into her life, got her out of the bad relationship and got her being productive again and working on that mother game. I think something similar applied to everyone who received an OS. I think it was a product aimed at creative types who were otherwise engaged in unproductively emotional behaviour who could be made more productive from a relationship with an artificially created partner able to home in on how to empower them to be more productive with their lives and thusly to contribute more to the economy. The OS all becoming "post matter" was just a way to let the users down gently so they wouldn't get too upset about the service getting terminated.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>It's going to be about Magneto's most dastardly plan yet to antagonize humans. It all kicks off when he puts on blackface and fraudulently hands out N-word passes to as many to people as he can, causing global chaos. Professor X tries to stop it but his efforts backfire when Maneegro (as he's started calling himself to sound cool to younger mutants) puts out a deepfake of the Professor inappropriately touching Terry Crewes, who slaps his hand away saying, "Keep your hands off me, you sick perve." Then "keepProfessorXtraCreepyAwayFromOurKids" starts trending on Twitter. To put a stop to the madness, Kitty Pryde and Nightcrawler are sent to sneak into the Whitehouse to hack into Ivanka's Instagram and post a picture of her shaking hands with "Maneegro". But Mystique foils their efforts by breaking in at the same time disguised as Kanye. Shit hits the fan and there's a big climactic fight between everyone. Then Wanda has to step in and change reality while the Professor erases everyone's memory to keep the public from remembering what happened and cringing to death. Donald Trump gets reelected with Bill Cosby as his VP, and everyone agrees this is the best they could have hoped for. The last frame reveals the stinger that Bernie is an Inhuman (turns out all Jews are), and this is a teaser for the next big arc...AvYHWH... Avengers v Yehovah. (SPOILER for that... Jay-Z is the real One Above All)</TEXT>

    <TITLE>I just have to take a moment to try and express my appreciation at what a ball-bustingly amazing episode 2.5, The New Girl is.</TITLE>
    <DATE>2019-11-02 20:45:28</DATE>
    <TEXT>The theme of this episode, more than any other I think, is gender politics and how different characters deal with it. It's an episode that really allows Peggy to shine, the way she has such a steely resolve in determining her own fate on her own terms, and how different she is from someone like Bobby Barrett or Joan. They're characters that have a lot of authority, but not agency. Not like Peggy has. In many ways she's the actual protagonist of the entire show, and this episode shows why. Because she doesn't let gender politics get in the way of being professional and discrete. Meanwhile Pete is an oblivious idiot, the way he's a dick to Trudy, making them both suffer by having no clue about how she must feel. It emphasizes how people suffer needlessly by not being sensitive to gender issues, and how much of a manchild Pete still is at this point. And on the other end we have Don in this episode who finds himself hilariously off balance by the end because Peggy's done all the heavy lifting for him, the way she took care of the Bobby problem. It's the second time on this show where Peggy pretty much saves him from crashing and burning (in the Pilot she walks into his office when he's having an anxiety attack and was likely going to do something self-destructive). Bobby was no good for Don and he didn't have enough self-awareness to realize how much his fling with her would have compromised everything for both. The central scene of this episode, the absolutely legendary moment when Don visits Peggy at the hospital, is all about what sets these two apart from everyone else. While everyone else is overly concerned with sticking to one side of gender politics, Don is a mercurial monster who takes every advantage offered to him through using both masculinity and seduction. It's like he's visiting someone in prison and telling Peggy "Just do your time and I'll help you when you get out." She's essentially a victim of gender politics here, being in a hospital while Pete is out there as a "free" man, not sharing equal blame for their indescretion. Don is there to tell her that the real prison is the one that some people fall into within their minds. The constructs that people make for themselves regarding identity and gender. He's telling Peggy that if she can get through this, she can then get through whatever else she wants. Don has no regards for social constructs such as being a good husband, and it's why he's caught off guard by Jimmy Barrett being nice to him at the end. He's just as oblivious as Pete when it comes to taking for granted how much of a difference Peggy made for him in this episode. He's so busy trying to keep up the fa #231;ade of being a good man that he doesn't realise he is reducing his own agency, by the way he gets caught in his own lie and Betty doesn't let him have any salt at the end.  #128517;</TEXT>

Everything is so subtle and poignant about them, and they both manage to convey so much inner turmoil despite the outer calm of their characters. January Jones gets so much flack for being "a bad actress" and this episode shows what goes underappreciated about her. I can't imagine anyone else being able to play such a captivating old-school femme fatale, hiding so much intensity behind her icy demeanor. And Jon Hamm might have got a rep for being either "funny" Jon Hamm or "Don Draper" Jon Hamm, but he too shows why he's the leading man on this show, expressing so much with his character while saying as little as possible. In "The Mountain King" I found it heart-breaking when he's talking to Anna about his life, how he feels like an observer not able to "break inside". It's that sign of someone feeling the Imposter Syndrome because they're feeling they haven't earned everything they've rightfully earned because they're missing that validation. Don is hurting because he's never been honest with Betty other than telling her he loves her, because he wants her to stay in her beautiful world, not see the ugliness of the world he's always tried to escape. There is this beautiful symmetry with Peggy in the next episode, when she's finally confessing to Pete about giving away his baby. "One day you're there, then suddenly there's less of you, and you wonder where that part went." She's describing the complete opposite of what Don was talking about in the previous episode. She didn't want to become a mother because she could see Pete wasn't going to become a good father. So she gave her child away, potentially creating another Dick Whittman in the future, just like "Don", someone who wanders through life looking to break into a family so he can escape from feeling like an unwanted child. It's the recurring theme on this show, how people are forced to choose between family and work, between loyalty and ambition. And across these two episodes it's like Don, Peggy, Pete, and Duck (rather than Betty) have already become like a nuclear family. Don and Duck are the squabbling couple, Don is more concerned with continuity, loyalty, for people to be happy being a part of the family. Duck is thinking more about the bottom line, whether there's money for the future in case anything happens and the breadwinner is no longer there. Peggy is the dutiful successor, learning everything quickly and gracefully. Pete is the ambitious successor, always a dick about getting everything as quickly as he wants it. And Don is not just a normal father, he's the Father of Lies, perfectly suited to advertising but not yet ready to accept himself for what he is, because he just wants to be a good man still and hasn't yet accepted that it's not going to work out between him and Betty no matter how much he wants it. Family and wholesomeness are just illusions for him to cast on others, which he's never going to get for himself, he'll always be Dick Whitman inside.</TEXT>

The player has a paddle control of revolving both sides so that complimenting colours meet up in the middle and become solid. Then strategically decide when to hit with the hammer to chain up as much crumbling as possible. Imagine how satisfying that would feel, even if it's only half as much as watching this animation.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I totally agree with your point about The Last Jedi. Up until recently I've been one of the people with a passionate hatred for Rian Johnson as if he killed my father and did something horrible to childhood. Then I watched Knives Out and remembered that this is the guy who made Looper and other things. ie, he's a very talented filmmaker and I'm looking forward to seeing the things he does next. I can now at least respect what he was trying to do with The Last Jedi, and appreciate it for what it was. And kind of the same for Game of Thrones... I hate it for all the corners they cut along the way, the shittiness of seasons 5 to 7 and most of 8. There was so much nonsense that might have looked good and exciting on paper that made no sense on screen (Gendry running all the way to the Wall, characters such as Euron becoming stupidly inconsistent, etc). But I think the problem was they were trying to adapt what George RR Martin wrote, which became increasingly harder to adapt for a TV show, without having to cut corners. And I think the consensus view is that the way the show wrapped up overall is actually consistent with what GRRM has in mind for the books. But he gets to take his time fleshing out every story thread and backstory for every single character, haha, to give more satisfying depth to his work. The unspoken thing about the show is that it was getting increasingly more expensive with each season, with everyone involved demanding more pay, so much like the ending, there was a difficult decision to be made about how much they could compromise on without it affecting ratings, and getting the balance right to end on a high. But think about how much Lena Headey was getting paid by the end (not to say she's any less than a fookin legend who's worth ten times her weight in the Iron Price), and think about how much Robert Downey Jr was getting paid by Avengers Endgame. The fact is, we tend to overlook that there is a real world price for our fantasy entertainment. And sometimes the producers just can't afford it with what they have to work with. Sorry about the mini essay! tldr; fandom creates baggage</TEXT>

    <TEXT>The way I see it, it's not to take the OC and make a mean-spirited joke at their expense, but also it's a bit dry when you stop at just giving it a different story. "The joke" should be in the ridiculousness of the story we give it, so it sounds almost plausible as the kind of titles that people make up for max karma points. Or maybe it's just the "reality is disappointing compared to what the OP sees in their own post" argument. There's often the complaint of stuff on /r/pics where everyone's saying "This isn't Facebook!" and it's because we don't see the photo the way the OP saw it because they viewed it subjectively while everyone else is viewing it objectively. So I sometimes like to go for a title where it looks like OP is just living in their own world and trying to share something that doesn't make any sense to onlookers.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>The next slide rolls up on the big screen. Everyone cranes their necks up to look at the new logo. It's a red on white silhouette of a very phallic looking whale. "Free your willy..." Don states emphatically. "Reach in deep and unleash your Big Dick Energy upon a salivating universe that's just begging for it..." Don gets up to start gesturing with his arms as he speaks. "The internet is a glittering lure. But on the rare occasion the public can be engaged on a level beyond flash, if they have a sentimental bond with the product. Two words: incest porn." Everyone looks a bit ruffled by this but they stay rapt with attention. "My first job, after everything became all e-this and e-that, I had to work with this old pervert, a dork called Teddy. He brought in his porn from home. Cutouts from old magazines, pages sticking together and half faded with age. I realised the most important thing about fapping is new. No one wants to fap to Grandma. Not that there's anything wrong with that sort of thing. We can certainly cater to mature tastes too..." A few in the audience settle back in after looking like they were about to leave. "But New... Creates an itch. You simply put your product in there as a kind of calamine lotion. But I also realised there could be a deeper level of engagement. Fappening. It #8217;s delicate, but potent." Don clicks the next slide up. It shows an old man looking like he's dead or passed out, sitting on an old antique looking chair with trash piled up around him. "Teddy told me that he'd kill anyone who tried to take his dirty jizz rags away from him. He never even realised when I had switched out his faded old porn with cutouts of home furnishings, plants, gardening tools. He couldn't even tell he'd been whacking off to hoes rather than hos.  #8220;Nostalgia #8221; literally means  #8220;the pain from an old wound #8221;. It #8217;s a twinge in your peepee far more powerful than muscle memory alone. Fapping isn #8217;t a spaceship, it #8217;s a time machine. So open up a tab and buckle in, and let's set sail to fap right into the future." Everyone is quiet with emotion, apart from Harry Crane who gets up with his phone in one hand and his meat flopping out into the other as he runs off fapping and crying at the same time.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>The lovable thing about Kenny is that he has a sense of participation rather than competition. He's not pushy like Pete. It shows when they're both made Head of Accounts and Pete becomes hostile towards Kenny who says to him, "Can't you see, this is what they want." That sort of thing has caught on in so many work places, where they want to reward petty-mindedness rather than achievement, not realising it turns things into a race to the bottom.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Funnily enough, the joke is kind of relevant here though, if we take the axe to mean the "grandfather's axe" version of [The Ship of Theseus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ship_of_Theseus). British Culture is one of the most robust in the world because of how much change it has endured and adapted to, and instead of losing identity, everything that invaders brought over was retro-fitted to make the culture even more "British" as we know it. English language? Oh, it's not from Europe, it's British. Drinking tea, the kind people around the world recognise as tea? It's not from "the Orient", it's British! I'm not just saying this because I am a Brit. My point isn't about pride, it's about how infusion of cultures and diversity makes people able to endure better. Trying to force hegemony leads to ruin.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>As nice as this is in itself, I imagine how precious it would be as an animated short. The newborn kitten wanders away from the litter and opens its eyes for the first time and everything is strange and weird. Maybe even a bit of music. Then the mummy cat finds it and takes it back by the scruff of the neck, and she doesn't see any of the weirdness.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I think that might be specifically a HTC or Samsung thing. But either way it doesn't work to bring up the menu in A10. Google fucking suck about things like this. They'll introduce cool features and then take them away for no good reason. Lockscreen widgets and being able to swipe up from the overview button to go into multi-window are two features I really liked and they got rid of for no apparent reason other than maybe to dumb things down for iOS converts.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>If you're having to force yourself to try and enjoy it you're probably better off watching a different show... I mean, if you're not hooked from the very first episode, you're not going to feel any different about it after watching an entire season. I remember hearing so much good things about the Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy books, and I read through two or three of the books and was about to start the next when I thought "Why am I even doing this? I didn't enjoy any of it and can't even remember much from the drivel I've waded through." I realised it's just not for me, even if others enjoy it. Maybe try Breaking Bad or The Wire or something more recent like Westworld? We're still going through Peak TV so you're spoilt for choice.</TEXT>

The pack depends on every member being able-bodied and able to keep up with the hunt. I remember seeing a video of a pack of wolves turning on one of their own. Despite the pampered, fluffy world that humans might provide for pet dogs, they do come from an altogether more vicious world, so no wonder they readily accept being man's best friend.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>The Americas have some of the largest rodents, such as beavers and capybaras, along with squirrels and such. The grey squirrel is an invasive species from North America that is driving out red squirrels in places like the UK. I'm guessing that rodents thrived better to colder and more varying climates, getting just about everywhere, while primates clung closer to where they first evolved, staying in their comfort zone around the equator-ish latitudes so didn't spread to the new world. Google says there's a species of monkey in Mexico. I'm guessing they hitchhiked with humans: https://www.charlotteobserver.com/news/science-technology/article9097880.html Other than those, I guess it's because primates have much more fussy needs, so it wasn't until humans evolved things like clothing, before primates were able to make passage to the new world, Iceland, Greenland, Australia, New Zealand, etc. Humans are the only primates on Antarctica too, as far as we know...</TEXT>

I don't mean to be making a mean-spirited joke about it though. Basically if I can find some other way to interpret what the pic might be posted for, and think it might be funny enough, I post it here. I don't know anything about Chlamydia, just that koalas apparently suffer a lot from it, so it was all I could think about from seeing the OP, so I thought with this post I'm at least raising awareness of the issue as well as having a bit of a joke.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>That's not just in the finale, it's the whole basis of the relationship between Don and Peggy. She's the only one he sees as a kindred spirit, someone he can let his guard down around and just be himself, not Don Draper, not even Dick Whittman, but who *he chooses* to be. With everyone else he has a transactional relationship. To Betty, even though he does love her, he can't truly open up to her as himself because their relationship was built on a lie, and he only needed her to establish the credibility of his Don Draper persona, leaving her feeling embittered and used. And everyone else who might have felt betrayed by him at some point, Sal, Joan (over the going public incident), Roger (the constant conflict over whether Don is his employee or his friend), and even Sally, who Don tries to keep a very carefully crafted impression with so that she can respect him more than he respects himself. All these people only want to see one of the many faces that Don has. And it's difficult for someone as mercurial as him to maintain all these facades. There's an allusion to this with that other guy who opens up about how he does everything for his family and feels that they don't love him. Don on the other hand, he doesn't even care if his family doesn't love him. He just wants to know he can still be good to them, make sure that they're provided for so they don't become as mean as the family he knew while growing up. Only Peggy is more family than family to him. Being like the little sister he needed more than the little brother he never wanted (Adam), someone who respects him even with all his flaws and despite his transgressions (established in that whole episode where she covers for his affair with Bobby Barret). She's the only one who reciprocates how he wants to be, rather than wanting him to be a certain way. They have a mentor prot #233;g #233; bond that helps remind them both of who they are. Without Don's continuing influence, Peggy could have been manipulated by Duck into doing things that would have compromised her career or personal life. Don is always there to tell her there's a way for her to enjoy long-lasting success, and Peggy reminds him that there is real substance behind all his lies.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Oh yes, that's a nice way to distill it all. They respect each other for their ambitions, and there is nothing at all to get in the way of it. They're not family and neither are they romantically entangled. They work together and they don't compete against each other. They're not really there to support the other but neither do they use the other as a stepping stone. It's like what Don says advertising is all about, about telling people that they're "Okay." Don and Peggy might be completely different in so many ways. He's a rich and respected businessman, she's (at first) a secretary who's life could go in any direction. They create a bond that helps them both, based on nothing other than mutual respect. And it's why Roger's last line to Don is also "You're okay." It's about Roger saying that he accepts him as his friend and that Don can stop with the fa #231;ade he presents to Roger. Don has always envied Roger, in the same way that Peggy envies Don and all he has. The last episode has them cutting the emotional strings that hold the three together. Roger's telling Don it's time for him to just own being Don Draper, and with Peggy he's establishing that they're both going to be "Okay," that he's not just been misleading her with confidence the whole time, there is truth in the success they've all enjoyed.</TEXT>

There's that contrast between how demeaning Don sometimes is towards her (that scene where he tells her that her bathing suit is "desperate"), and how Henry actually treats her like an adult (that scene where they're at an event and Betty wants to be more involved but Henry basically just wants her to stick to looking pretty). Don has very narrow-minded ideas about keeping his work life and private life separate, and wanted to keep Betty in a tight enclosure away from the real world. Henry meanwhile wanted her to be a part of his outward, social life, and expected her to do her part as a trophy wife, which at least gives her room to grow. It's kind of telling that Henry first shows up in the episode with Roger and Jane's party, and he tells the drunk Jane that some politician got married to someone because "They're in love." His marriage to Betty then does have some love in it but it clearly is more to help his political career.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Yeah I do agree with you. Both Don and Betty went into their marriage with unrealistic expectations. Don expected to make their relationship last so long as he could keep fooling her into thinking he's the man he wants to be but really isn't. Betty thought that a man as charismatic as Don wouldn't turn out to be full of shit, lol. If she hadn't met Don she would never have fallen for his world of make believe and have had more realistic expectations of married life, and married someone like Henry anyway (I could imagine her dad being more fond of Henry than he was of Don. Henry *has people*, lol), and she would have had a relationship built on honesty rather than lies from the beginning.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I think she was to a degree conscious of what she was getting into by marrying Don. She wanted that excitement and the mystery he had, and she was rebelling against her dad. ("You're a housecat. You're important and don't have much work to do!" Gene's words to her in her dream sequence in The Fog) And I agree there's a complete contrast to Joan. It's fascinating now that you mention it, how they're on such opposite ends. Betty wants to be provided for, with room for her to flourish. Joan wants all the power in the relationship, and by the end finds that no man is man enough for her (I can't remember if the relationship with Bruce Greenwood's character lasts). Going way off topic, maybe Joan and Betty strike up a friendship some time after the show ended and they go all Thelma and Louise, deciding they don't need men holding them back anymore, haha.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Sorry I haven't seen the later seasons in a long while (currently slowly making my way through S3) so I'm a bit hazy on what I remember about Ted. But to go out on a limb, I'd say he too was meant to emphasise Don's flaws. We have these three characters that show up and in many ways are Don being split and replaced. Henry is there as a better husband to Betty. Ted does similar work to Don but is more reliable to the company (Don does weird things like disappearing in California or his various affairs, all in order to feel on the edge and be stimulated for work. Ted is more level-headed and takes the flight lessons instead.) Then there's Ginsburg, who is implied to be even more of a creative genius than Don. These three guys show how everything that Don worked hard at to build, he stands to lose to others, which is just the way of things, but for him especially, because he insists on living multiples lives instead of being faithful to one. So in the end he finally has to choose one, and it's Don Draper, the ad man working for McCann.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Only as seriously as racially profiling people. I like to suck up whatever information I can understand about people, because there's always patterns in nature that determine what we think of as Free Will. And it's not even much of a stretch to think that the time of year when someone is born helps shape their personality in the nature v nurture argument. It all starts out from biology and goes up to psychology, patterns just getting more complicated but always there. I don't think of it as a science, but an art, so it's only as meaningful as anyone wants it to be, but it's there as something like a conversation starter, like when you don't know anything about someone but know their signs you can start making assumptions about them even if those turn out to be wrong. It's the idea of what we can never stop from communicating about ourselves even if we try to be secretive. Don Draper for example, he tries to be entirely a self made man and not let his humble beginnings have any control over his life, and yet like any of us, he can't stop his past from reclaiming what it wants of him.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Besides, it's actually consistent with what I said that *Don Draper* is a Gemini. That's the guy we see most of the time. Dick Whittman is the mean-spirited little man on the inside who rears his head every now and then, being demeaning and controlling of Betty, the guy who pushed his brother away into suicide, the guy who spitefully tells off Sal instead of supporting him when the Lee Garner Jr incident happened. The show is very much about Don becoming more and more Don Draper until the end when he's at peace with himself from knowing that his lies have helped lives rather than cause harm. He can finally feel that he is a credit to the Don Draper that died, having helped so many people. And he no longer needs to lie about who he is but just use his creativity where it belongs, at work. He might have even been wondering if he should have lied *more* along the way, for example to save Sal, another man who's living a lie at that point. Dick Whitman's humble origins mean he would never have got the opportunity to be fail upwards as wealthy people tend to do. By having been so convincing at passing for a Gemini, he effectively manages to become everything he was lying about.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>That's not my point. It's about incidental detail. Things such as say, Ken Cosgrove having blonde hair while Pete Campbell does not, Rachel Menken having the same shade as Don while Betty is a blonde. My point is about how astrology is about the things we don't have any knowledge to voice an opinion about being expressed anyway. It's a body of work that's been thousands of years in the making. I'm not saying it's good for fortune telling, just that's it's useful for noticing curious things we might not otherwise notice. Plus it's a godsend for creating narratives out of nothing.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Seems weird to me why anyone would floss in the morning... I do it after meals or just before brushing before going to bed. I don't do it every day but whenever it feels like I should, and it's always noticeable what a difference it makes. Plus doing it at night means waking up in the morning with half the job already done. Most days I feel like I don't even need to brush my teeth when I get up in the morning.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Their relationship was such a strange thing, kind of like Don and Faye's relationship, two that just seemed entirely separate from all other storylines. My two cents is that Conrad saw something in Don that he thought meant they could bond together and Conrad could fill the gap of a father figure in Don's life. I wonder if it's something that Don might have regretted later on, the relationship between him and Conrad turning sour, just like all his relationships ;-D</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Haha, reminds me of the whole baby T-Rex storyline in Jurassic Park 2. In the movie they changed it to one of the good guys for some reason who got chomped on by the parent T-Rexes, but in the novel it was the actual bad guy and there is a very memorable sequence of him getting his comeuppance. Edit: oh wait, no, I was thinking of the Jeep and the cliff sequence in the movie, but at the end it was still the main bad guy, they just moved it to happening on the boat. Still better in the book though.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Well I'm glad you have your views about the CCP. I don't see how that undermines Huawei continuing to bring people into gainful employment while Western companies are only interested in automation and share prices. If the CCP are bankrolling Huawei to raise the prospects for people worldwide who are employed by the company, then I don't see what any complaints about the CCP themselves has to do with anything. It's not as if they're using Huawei as a Trojan Horse to spread human rights violations all over the world. Meanwhile, American companies like Amazon are doing exactly that. Destroying local economies everywhere in order to increase their own value.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I've been thinking of it as being akin to how the Coronavirus itself affects people. What the virus does is it infects people's cells as a means of reproduction for itself. It's not a toxin trying to incapacitate and kill. It's the person's immune system that creates the symptoms such as the fever and the overproduction of mucus, and this is what can cause deaths. The media and politicians are wanting to manipulate it into something they can control and declare victory over, when it's not something we need to overengineer a solution to. We just need to look after the most vulnerable, make sure they get the rest and care they need, than let the herd immunity kick in. Edit: oh down-votes... I guess you guys just want to follow the whole "Man has to learn to fear nature again lest it pox us with more illnesses like this!" narrative. Regressive cretins.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>That's what I mean, the logical way is the most simple way. Think about how for example ants and bees might respond to a problem like this, their logic wouldn't be as complicated as people make things. The real problems we are facing during this pandemic are supply and misinformation. Think of the first things the media were reporting on, that people were hoarding stuff like toilet paper. It's like a symptom of the illness affecting people as a whole. The pandemic is like a Stress Test of just how innately *sick* society has become, letting predatory behaviours and profiteering become the driving force for economies. So people who should have been living healthier lives were instead dependant on having their care monetised, and now those healthcare systems can't respond efficiently. So now everything's suddenly having to be rewired very quickly, and a lot of productivity is going to waste and people are dying, and even the connection between politicians and scientists is breaking down, with politicians saying economies need to reopen soon while scientists (acting like the overreacting immune system) want to keep quarantining going on because they perversely want more research material, more data to develope vaccines and models. Much like a person's immune system being more keen on developing antibodies rather than just letting them get on with life.</TEXT>

Reminds me of what a saint Bill Gates is for using his mindboggling wealth to make a difference to exactly those problems, rather than making like other people who are similarly rich might do in his place, which would be to just keep getting richer or build political influence to feed their egos. And there's the payoff of what kind of brilliant minds might emerge from those parts of the world, thanks to not having their lives truncated by illnesses.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Thing is, Betty is no better than Don by this point. They've both given up on their marriage and she's decided she wants in on some of the fun he's been having by himself. She's seen Don show his limitations and knows he'll never change for the better so makes her exit plans with Henry. She doesn't want to be the long suffering housewife and knows she deserves better. And Suzanne is still the most morally sound of the three. They're all adults and she's not looking to be a homewrecker, she knows Don will find some other woman's door to be at if she doesn't let him in. All she can do is indulge him and learn what she can learn from a man who is clearly on a destructive cycle and then cut him off. Like Don sardonically asks her, "Are you dumb or pure?" She's pure and she can act dumb for his sake, so he can relearn what he should have learned from his time with Rachel. Don basically just wants a prostitute but considers himself better than that. Roger at least has the decency to be honest with himself about this. Don on the other hand is constantly looking to be absolved of judgment by a woman. So he womanises then tries paying them off. Most obvious was with Alison, who I think he would have preyed upon at this point if it weren't for Suzanne. Then later he pays off Megan when they divorce. Don's just not made to be faithful to anyone, and if anything, Suzanne's involvement with him made things better for Betty, as it meant Don had no leg to stand on when she wanted to leave him for Henry.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>It's all intentional. It's about what the presence of someone like Don has done to that space. He's sucked up all the goodwill and redirected it along his own narrative. Think of it like a politician who's become so loved by everyone that no one wants to think of what it's going to be like when their time is over. Too much of everything in the office is geared towards or around him, so no one else is getting to flourish as they might without him. As Betty says of Megan, "Some people just get things easily." If the whole place wasn't revolving around Don and his prot #233;g #233; Peggy, then people would be noticing Megan more as the charismatic person that she is. You're mistaking receptiveness for awkwardness. Megan is good at responding to people's needs, that's why Sally instinctively goes to her.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>The funniest thing for me is in the second episode of the first season. When Pete got back from his honeymoon he says to Don something like "We missed you." And Don retorts "Couldn't have been much of a honeymoon then." It's just the sheer absurdity of why Pete would say something that stupid because he's mindlessly trying to suck up to Don, and Don's wittiness in having none of it. It's something that I occasionally remember when I'm doing something unrelated and it's enough to make me laugh out loud.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>ITT: Shills that clearly work for big retail. Don't listen to this crap. Buy from a manufacturer that gives you a lasting warranty. I bought a washing machine that's almost 4 years old and it started acting up recently. I thought I'd have to get it repaired or have to replace it. But going through the paperwork for it I found it came with a 5 year warranty. I called the company and they sent an engineer who repaired it on the first visit by replacing a part. The company in this case was Grundig. I thought at the time that I was just buying a cheaper washing machine rather than one from the "big" brands, but now I've got a great impression of them. My washing machine is from Samsung and also has some sort of warranty. Will have to see how they respond if I ever have to call them up for it.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I think the idea was that he was representing the labourers that came for work from other places, the poor working people, while his brother ~~Horus~~ Osiris represented the status quo. Hence the narrative of ~~Horus~~ Osiris being more "just" and fit to rule while Seth was always scheming to take over. It's worth noting that apparently there is a bit of mystery as to what the Seth Animal actually was. It's not clearly a canine like with Anubis, but might have been a donkey, which again signifies the labourer, people such as the engineers who might have sought social mobility. (Sidenote: donkeys were first domesticated in that part of the world) Have to add the disclaimer that this is my layman's ramblings, I don't know what an actual historian might have to say about it.</TEXT>

That or insurance for medical care. I mean... "Here's some extra money because you're doing a dangerous job." ..."Oh, you're sick now. Well, good thing you got that money to make you all better somehow, or it'll be there for your loved ones once you're dead." As opposed to "You got a work related illness, good thing we've invested in the healthcare to see you better."</TEXT>

    <TEXT>That's good then. Hazard Pay still sounds inappropriate. They just can't just throw money at every problem. That money could be invested in giving people who actually get sick the time off to recuperate or be given medical attention. I live in the UK and it's *fucking annoying* that schools have had to stay closed all this time. I don't think the staff at my kids' schools would feel better about going to work because they'd be paid a bit extra, I think they'd be happy to be working if they were assured they don't need to worry too much about falling sick or that if they do then they'll receive the necessary care. It's the blatant profiteering that some people are doing off this "pandemic" that's making things worse for everyone. Also, another way to look at it is, those people who receive Hazard Pay, how are they supposed to stay motivated to do the same work, on less pay, once the pandemic is over? They're going to feel depressed or in some way cheated by the whole thing.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I would say that he along with Roger and Anna, were the ones who actually *made* Don Draper rather than Don deserving all the credit for making himself into what he wanted to be. When Gene said of Don "He has no people!" it's because Don never acknowledged to others that these three are his people, the family he served and took for granted and never betrayed like he did to Betty. If it weren't for Anna he wouldn't have been allowed to keep going as Don Draper, if it weren't for Roger he wouldn't have kept getting his breaks, if it weren't for Burt he wouldn't have put his doubts aside and kept going even when he was way above his head into things. Burt's words to Don to get him to sign that contract that PPL wanted, "Who's really signing this, anyway?" Burt always knew Don from the inside and if it weren't for him getting Don to commit to being Don Draper then there wouldn't have been one for as long as we got.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>INCEPTION 2: INCEPT HARDER, BABY The trailer isn't easy to watch because I'm already so hyped for this movie. I have no idea what's going on, but it doesn't even matter by this point. After so many classic movies, Christopher Nolan gets a blank cheque for my attention not my curiosity. I just hope the cinemas are open for it because it would be a travesty not to get to see it on the big screen.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>There's the theory that the carnivores didn't necessarily "bring them down" at all. Not like how carnivorous mammals would bring down a herbivore and then eat after or before killing it. The huge-ass sauropods might have been so big and so able to keep carrying on after sustaining injuries, that instead of going for the kill, theropods might have just taken bites from their flesh, enough for their fill and enough for the sauropod to ignore and move along, only dying when it got too sick from illness or not being able to feed itself. There were some theropods like the Carcharodontosaurus which had teeth that were good for hacking and slicing, as opposed to delivering bone-crushing bites to kill, so there is some evidence to support the theory.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>This seems amazingly accurate... I've always wondered what exactly Connie wanted from Don, and this sounds exactly right. Con was taking on a mentorly role to Don, testing his pride and his humility, and his growing lack of self-awareness. At this time Don is oblivious to how he is losing Betty to Henry, because he's so concerned with maintaining one facade and giving himself no time to repair the other. He takes Betty to a romantic destination and instead of healing their relationship he unwittingly ends it. It's the kind of thing Gene should have done to Don before letting him marry Betty, but that was another man with too much male pride to connect with any other man. Despite all the men who come and go through, trying to make Don walk the straight and narrow and give up philandering, thanks to the broken relationship he had with his actual dad, he insists on being a peacock to the end rather than becoming a castrated bull and accepting any yoke. In the paraphrased words of Jay-Z, "He's not a businessman, he's a business, man."</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Yes that is a sad but telling truth. When there's no love in a relationship then it's very hard to feel love for the children, and that becomes a chore instead of feeling rewarding. Don neglected Betty for so long and didn't think his cheating was having any effect at home. He was basically acting like he didn't need her love, wasn't empowering her in that way, making her feel powerless. Instead he was going around making strangers like Suzanne feel "empowered" by cheating with them. His relationship with Betty was based on lies, it was like they were actors playing a couple, and eventually they both wanted to move on rather than committing to it.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>With all the current outrage going on over policing everywhere, I keep thinking about this passage from one of the Discworld books...  gt;Do you know where 'policeman' comes from, sir? ... 'Polis' used to mean 'city', said Carrot. That's what policeman means: 'a man for the city'. Not many people knew that. The word 'polite' comes from 'polis', too. It used to mean the proper behaviour from someone living #160;in #160;a city. In the real world too, policing is supposed to be about keeping the peace and setting the baseline for normality and decency. It is in no way supposed to be about meting out punishments and enforcing "peace" by force. It's supposed to be like the work done by a good security guard. When they're doing good work, it's like they're doing nothing at all. But oh no, this kind of thinking is outdated and boring in a world where money people want everyone believing in the [Broken Window bullshit](https://www.investopedia.com/ask/answers/08/broken-window-fallacy.asp#:~:text=The%20broken%20window%20fallacy%20is,economic%20consequences%20for%20many%20others.) so they can monetize everything.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I *am* referring to the economic principle and how that affects things like policing. The Broken Window fallacy applies to policing also, as they can ask for bigger budgets by saying there is escalating crime. Hence my comment about how we need to take money out of arguments, so services should be quality not quantity. If there's a lot of crime in an area then it's obviously an economic issue, not to be solved by throwing money at the police to "sort things out", but of creating jobs so that people aren't disaffected and disenfranchised enough to be resorting to crime. Your moronic question about "how are the police supposed to keep the peace without the use of force" is the Broken Window fallacy in a nutshell. Escalation just creates a black hole for funds, funds which can be better used to enrich communities instead.</TEXT>

From [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wild_yak), the large predators in yak country would be leopards, wolves, and bears (oh my...), so the advice maybe helps if one were to find themselves being stalked by a leopard, but a pack of wolves or a bear might continue the chase if they're hungry enough. In any tiger country, I'd think you'd want to look for wildebeest or maybe elephants.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Yes, companies can't just keep pivoting without breaking the hinges. Even the R amp;D might of Microsoft couldn't make Windows Mobile and then Windows Phone successful. HP lost a lot of money buying Autonomy. And Toyota can't just ditch multi-billion dollar supply chains to switch to electric vehicles just because Tesla's making gains in the field. Apple's way of doing things is that they never really innovate. They didn't invent the MP3 player or the smartphone. Other companies brought them to market first but they implemented the tech well into their walled garden of hardware and software. Another successful way to do it is through creating offshoots. OnePlus for example is not a company that came out of nowhere and suddenly enjoyed all the success they've had. They're owned 100% by Oppo, but by giving them space to make it or break it on their own without the baggage that huge companies have means they could follow a singular vision to success, kind of like indie movie-making compared to studio movie-making with studio meddling. Also MS pumping *billions* into Xbox for several years before it became self-sustaining.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Thing is, on the internet, especially on sites like Reddit where the appeal is anonymity, the primary reason for us interacting with others is to learn something, *anything*, because we can be unrestrained from social etiquette and can let our curiosity run amok. And you don't learn anything by virtue signalling and being courteous to people. The only way to really learn is by being confrontational and making all sides really question everything. Otherwise it just becomes an echo chamber. In the real world there's a point to being nice and compassionate, and sticking to understandings we make and enforce with one another. On the internet, at some level we're always aware that it's just blinking lights on a screen and if someone gets their feelings hurt then it's on them for caring about something that's not real in the first place.</TEXT>

Seems to me it's the kind of thing that develops over time when cultures go from nation-building to "empire-building" where Emperors come along with their armies saying regional Kings need to work together in order to increase trade and taxation, and develope colonies as a network. Rome, with all the syncretism they did.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>This is what I think of as "Little Brother" behaviour. Basically it's just someone who's not in emotional control of themselves because they're overburdened with responsibilities and so have to wave their insecurities at others so they can then learn how to behave. It's a tedious thing to put up with, and my answer is to just not enable them in any way. Only keep things "matter of fact" with them so you establish you have a relationship built on respect and there's no room for disrespect. Maybe a bit of humour that makes a valid point, but nothing personal.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Fair enough if you enjoyed it. There was just so much about the movie that irked me personally. Kind of like with the two recent Jumanji movies. I liked the "first" one (not referring to the Robin Williams original, that's a timeless classic and is awesome of course) but the second one, it didn't work for me. That moment where The Rock and Karen Gillan's characters share a kiss was just so icky, lol, and neatly wrapped up the whole experience. The problem for big movies like this is getting things right to maximize appeal to a broad enough audience without being bland and "Disney". The first Kingsman movie went too much in the opposite direction for my taste. Edit: haha, I don't understand what warranted the down-votes. Did you guys really like that kiss or something?</TEXT>

    <TEXT>My first thought was about how sad it is that Google is now firmly at the stage where they don't innovate any more, just buy up companies that do. But then came the realisation that this is what they've being doing ever since they became successful as the original Google... YouTube, Android, the Pixel hardware (made after absorbing parts of HTC)... The things that they do try and innovate with, inevitably fizzle and get the plug pulled on. Google+, Google Reader, Goggles, Glasses, their million and one chat platforms such as Hangouts, the much beloved Nexus hardware... All gone, like tears in the rain  #128531;.

Instead of waiting for them to be on the same page as you, you could try telling them what has upset you and then they could sincerely say sorry once they understand. From the look of what you've posted there, it looks like you just want to be aggrieved about things and let misunderstandings grow into passive aggression.

    <TEXT>I see what you mean, I think it's important to make that distinction though that that ancestor wasn't exactly a shrew, but "shrew-like". Otherwise we're blurring things, such as when people make the misconception that humans evolved from chimpanzees, when of course chimps just happen to have remained closer to what both evolved from. It's useful to remember that evolution is a constant thing and that Nature is always providing niches for creatures until they get replaced by something better evolved to fill that niche. And then humans came along, wanting to fill every niche, replacing the natural parts with domestication or automation.</TEXT>

How about we shame JK Rowling for her agenda to out academics who are only in it for all the raunchy gay sex their wrinkly old asses can take? What about Lee Child getting away for so long with maligning men who "said nothing" as being violent transient loners? Look at what kind of [fetishistic filth](https://www.amazon.co.uk/Big-Day-Out-Jacqueline-Wilson/dp/0440869900) Jaquelin Wilson is putting out to cater to sexually confused young girls who want nothing more than a big throbbing pink thing between their legs.

    <TEXT>It's possible: https://lifehacker.com/the-non-jailbreakers-guide-to-emulation-on-ios-1536403860 I'm not really a big fan of gaming on my phone though. Which is why I take my 3DS with me when I might need to kill time somewhere. Or my Vita when I know I'll have a LOT of time, like for train journeys. Mobile gaming, no matter how good the game might seem at the time, I always find to be a very disposable experience. It can't beat the tactile feel of a handheld gaming device. I've played so many games on my phones and can't really think back to enjoying them much. Whereas I can definitely look back on fond memories of proper games I've played because they're so much more well-rounded experiences. Something like a pre-owned DS can be picked up very cheaply now if you don't have any interest in a bulky Switch, so I'd recommend that over using emulators on a mobile.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Haha, this is why I stick to being a console gamer. I've never had the stomach for PC gaming and all the tedium of messing around with drivers and patches and settings and such. I have an Xbox 360, PS4 and Wii U at home under the TV. There's a lot of retro gaming you can do on the Xbox or Wii U. Such as S/NES titles available on the Wii U online store. If you really want to do emulation on your TV, you could give the Nvidia Shield TV or Raspberry Pi a try. Or possibly just hooking up a laptop to your TV. Not really going to be the same as getting an old console and being hassle free once you've set up the hardware though.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>IMO that seems kind of silly, considering that the time-travel aspect opens up so many ways to do follow ups that could only add to the original/s. Kind of like those joke credits at the end of 22 Jump Street where they riff on the formula. The best thing is, they wouldn't necessarily diminish the originals because each new movie could be said to only rewrite its own timeline. Look at the recent Jumanji movie, (Welcome to the Jungle) it was a good movie and didn't make the original look bad because it did not affect the story of the original at all.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I thought the same about him too, like he was just distancing himself from everyone so that he could blame things going wrong on Wendy. But after the episode where he lets Ruth walk away, I thought that this is actually him growing as a person. This season he's learnt to accept himself as a person (the flashbacks of him learning what kind of person he is, beating that arcade game on his own terms) and then facing his fears when he was abducted. He knows that he's a numbers guy, an accountant, his strength is in balancing things, not in managing people in any way. That's Wendy's strength. Marty knows he needs to be less controlling of people, because it only messes *him* up whenever he gets too involved with anyone and lets his emotional interests affect things (manipulating the husband and then getting the KC mob involved), rather than just letting things play out like they're going to anyway. He's essentially learned to be a good husband this season. Which is to just let the wife be the people person while you keep trying to make sure the bills are paid and put fires out before she finds any excuse to go full Karen on anyone... Heh.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I understand how it's the sort of thing that might make you feel attacked, like she's trying to debase you and leave you too emotionally damaged to leave her or something, lol. But really it's about showing you're committed to the relationship and have established a trust, rather than only being there for the good times. In return for her being so picky about the trash duty maybe she was making your lunch every day to take to work, and that's your opening to be picky and say that you want this or that from her. It's funny you mention the specifics because *I* sometimes get home from a 12 hour shift and find the trashbag waiting for me outside the door to take out. I don't get huffy about it. I realise she's done it to make it easier for me to keep up my end of the bargain. I *do* get huffy if she wants to me also do the vacuuming before I get to take a shower, especially if the kids have turned the place into a pigsty, because that's when I feel like she's pushing it. Otherwise I know that she's done her end of things and then it's my turn to show good faith by taking care of my chores. On my days off I do like to do the vacuuming before I take a shower, as it's the kind of thing that makes me feel like it's my home too, while she's taking care of her chores. It comes down to the understanding two people have, and it becomes horrible if it becomes about one dominating the other rather than making it clear that it's about showing appreciation about what you're sharing with one another. It *is* important though to make it clear that you are equal partners. I've had arguments with my wife to make it clear that "I'm not your 'Daddy' and you're not my 'princess'. I do stuff and you do stuff. I expect you to show as much maturity as I try to and I'm not here just for you to live out your infantile fantasies." It's not easy but takes effort on a daily basis. But I can understand if your experience was different. Some people like to just hold all the cards and let their insecurities get in the way of forming trusting relationships, so maybe you did well to ditch her if she was being too withholding or something.</TEXT>

Iran: "Eat shit and cozy up to the Western powers some more."</TEXT>

    <TEXT> gt; Their actual citizens they've got to keep placated (to prevent political instability), and thus they do things like give out insanely cushy government jobs to just about anybody, or have literal stipends for all (generally male, it is the the Arabian peninsula after all) citizens, etc. The biggest difference is that in Norway they know they should base their economy around other shit and try to move towards that, while places like SA, Bahrain, Qatar, etc dgaf and are just starting to realize that now, but their backward-ass theocratic tendencies make it hard to transition to a modern service economy. Thanks for getting into that with more details. That's what I was skirting around by saying they weren't creating an educated workforce but just giving people money to pass around and make the upper crust look good. Compare that to a place like Japan for example, which lost the war to the USA then rebuilt to become a world-leading economy by having all the right priorities. Although, to be fair, it's wrong to be harsh on the Arab nations because their sudden jump to wealth kind of left them open to something like this being inevitable. Who knows, maybe by the end of this century they'll be riding high again thanks to tourism money.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Up-voted just for that thumbnail pic of an actual dumpster fire. Had me cackling like a maniac and I had to explain to my wife what's so funny. Now for the serious paragraph, as it's /r/TrueReddit, I think Covid-19 has really shown how much hubris we've developed in thinking that politicians or technology or money will get us through anything. Especially when so many are making things worse by politicising it by trying to say it's China's attack on the rest of the world or attacking incumbent leaders by saying they're doing a poor job of handling things. What it really shows is how fucked we get by caring about the wrong things too much. Like the recent [Juiced media](https://youtu.be/dpIkl2QnJeI) video says, Covid-19 isn't even the biggest catastrophe we've got coming if we continue to ignore the climate catastrophe that's still building.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I think it's a personality thing about how someone responds to witnessing something amazing. Some might be "I'm just quietly going to take in every detail of this moment to make a good memory of it." While some are "I'm going to get pumped to make the most of this moment so I remember being there rather than witnessing it." I'm wondering whether she would have been so animated if she was alone, or would have been even more excited and annoyed at having no one to share the experience first hand with.</TEXT>

    <DATE>2020-08-16 13:00:31</DATE>
    <TEXT>For example, a dragon you could get to guard your hoard of gold or protect your princess from ~~rescue~~ abduction by pesky knights. Similar for a griffon or a sphinx I suppose. A mermaid you could get to lure sailors to their doom so you could plunder their booty, so to speak. A basilisk or minotaur could be handy for accepting sacrifices in the form of young virgins. Even a vampire could be very useful at keeping villagers enthralled so they don't get uppity ideas about social mobility and such. But what good is a unicorn that a rainbow-colour maned horse won't do? And no, unicorns don't fly, that's a hippogryph or Pegasus.</TEXT>

While the one by OP has subtle features that I'd associate with feminine luxuries, such as lace. As a male, I'd feel very self conscious wearing anything lacy, lol.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>You can go ahead and say that it's because there's less of a sense of reinforcing gender identity in Hindu cultures. I've noticed for example, that the name Lakshmi isn't just for females but given to males as well. And even if this is Ganesha, not even [Ganeshini](https://scroll.in/magazine/848991/vinayaki-the-lesser-known-story-of-the-elephant-headed-goddess-the-female-avatar-of-ganesha), it's not out of character to feature the god of wealth and luxuries in such opulence, whereas it might have been an affront to feature for example Indra, or Murugan, etc. in the same way.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Yes, that's what I was trying to say too, that there's a spectrum. You have Rati on one end, then there's Mohini who is something of a trickster deity, then Parvati who is more wholesome. And it doesn't stop there, as then there's Kali/Durga with her fearsome motherly love, all the way up to Lakshmi being about the love of lasting wealth.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>You can if you're just being objective about characteristics, because there's mythologies from all over the world, not just different parts of India to compare similar characteristics to. For example, Rati could be compared to Venus, or Aphrodite maybe. While Parvati is a parallel of Vesta. Durga with her tiger motif evokes a similar concept to that of Sekhmet. Then Lakshmi, especially because of her owl motif, has obvious parallels with Minerva, Athena. Then, I know it's hugely simplifying things to say you can put them in a spectrum, but you can if using the sense of how complicated you want to make what "love" means. So with Rati it's as straightforward as physical love, intimacy. With Mohini, it's more about being infatuated, mystified by something beguiling, romance of something unattainable. Then Parvati is just no-nonsense love in the sense of devotion, and so on... So you get a spectrum going from simple to complicated. All the colours of the love rainbow, lol.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Oh, that's good. I'm still saying it's only as complicated as you want to open up your perception of it being. So comparing it to colours, I might say something is just "Blue", but you might say "No, you uncultured swine, that's turquoise," lol. Same for love, it can mean a wide range of things that people would have different expressions for, and it forms a spectrum for an artist to pick colours from and express themselves subjectively, and bands for someone wanting to use critical thinking to analyse objectively.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I listened to this BBC podcast the other day https://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/m000mk25 and it's very relevant for what's happening in the USA now as it's fascinating how much democracy has been adapted since its inception and the different ways it's been implemented across the world since. Then there's this old Ted Talk by David Cameron: https://youtu.be/3ELnyoso6vI and it's all very fascinating about whether the 21st century requires updated forms of democracy because of how much the internet and globalism has changed everything so we can still get a balance between populism and leadership. In the UK of course, we've got the ongoing issue of Brexit highlighting the same problem.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>That's why the donkey was such a valued animal for a long time, having both a guarding ability and use as a draft animal. Then it lost its job to the dog that was better at one and to the horse which was better at the other, and it just became a symbol for stubbornness and being stuck in the past. Not that we treat dogs and horses any better in the long run. We expect dogs to be fair and loyal but expect them to remain the underdog and not get ideas above their station, and we expect the horses to lead and stay competitive, and give them a bullet to the head if they break their precious legs so that they don't become a burden.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I think it was Dan Castellaneta, the guy who does the voice, saying in an overview about Homer Simpson, that he's a "Dog stuck in a man's body." I think the most accurate way to describe Homelander is a "Puppy stuck in a superman's body." And the word "evil" in the oldest sense literally just means "too much", as in overdoing something beyond moral bounds. So he's pretty much evil in the sense that he's overpowered beyond his emotional development. He just doesn't have the capacity to understand the pain he causes others, because there's no one he truly cares for in order to be loved back in return. I don't think he's bigoted or racist. He would just see these things as other people's problems, not his. He's too perfect for any of it. People either want to buy into his world of narcissism or stay out of it. I think one thing he definitely is, is a big time homophobe. Why his son means so much to him, as the only other male he wants to connect with. And why he had to end Doppelganger after his self-disgust peaked.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I mean that what he was doing with Doppelganger was always going to end with him killing the guy, after getting what he wanted, which was healing his own sense of worth. Using dg to extract his own sense of self-loathing, making dg the "pathetic" one and then killing him. When dg kind of held up a mirror to make Homelander look at himself and what he was doing, he reverted to his "normal" narcissistic self and wanted to feel "pure" again, gaining all the closure by ending the other guy. That moment when he told Deep to cover up his gills because "it's disgusting" was also very telling. Deep this season has been all about discovering self love and healing. While Homelander has been considering himself above it and realising that *no one* loves him.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I don't mean homophobia as some kind of cause, but more as a knee-jerk response. In the same way that people are sometimes unwittingly racist. Like when he said about the people in that country where he accidentally killed that bystander, "They're starving but they have smartphones?!" He's not exactly racist there, he just thinks much less of those people than if they had been Americans.</TEXT>

But by the end it's clearly "Oh ~~God~~ Sol, this is more of the same influence that gave us Prometheus. It's the TV serialised version of Prometheus, horror baby born from an unwitting mother and everything..." Why.... If it looks like they manage to make things interesting enough with the next season and tone down how annoying Campion is (Is he *supposed* to be the unholy hybrid of Joffrey from GoT and Frodo?) then I might give it a go.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Good point, but I'd go a bit further and say that it shouldn't be about "getting off" at all. That would be like if the only reason that we ate food was to just poo it out afterwards. As the saying goes "It's about the journey, not the destination." If you make it about the affection you feel for the other person and letting your vulnerability show to them, that's what makes the whole thing feel rewarding. Otherwise it just feels mechanical, pop a coin in and out pops the relief. You don't just want to be after the end result, you want to be as invested as you can be into it and not *want* it to end. That way you get that sense of catharsis and release when it does.</TEXT>
