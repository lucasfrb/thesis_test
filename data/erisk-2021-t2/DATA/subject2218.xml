    <DATE>2019-10-22 04:20:46</DATE>
    <TEXT>I feel like a horrible person, but when other people lose weight like my friends, I get almost angry that they are losing weight. It's awful for me to think this way, but I cant help it. I have this weird need to be the only person losing weight, cause if someone else is losing weight then I feel like I'm a failure and they are better than me. I am happy for others to a point, but mainly I just get so angry at them and myself. I've never EVER shown my feelings and never would. I feel like apart of it is that I'm jealous, even when I've lost more or continue losing more. Does anyone else struggle with this or am I just a horrible person? I hate it so much, and it doesn't make sense to me.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Thank you, and I didnt mean to make it sound like I was wanting someone to diagnose me, more give some insight into my wacked out habits. I never look at an ED as something as simple as a relationship with food. More that if I'm not skinny and eat constantly theres no way I'm valid. So thank you very much  #128522;</TEXT>

    <TEXT>You know those people who are like "lol I have zero friends" but are always out hanging with people and having a good time? I'm serious when I say I have no friends. It sucks because I have a boyfriend and wish I could be with him all the time, but he has friends he hangs out with and I'm basically left alone waiting for him. Part of me is grateful so I don't have to worry about more people knowing about my eating habits and self-harm, but it gets old being alone all the time. Just wish I could find people like me to hang out with. Anyone else relate? *EDIT: if anyone wants to just text or have someone to talk to, let me know. Obviously I could use the friendship as well.</TEXT>

I would stop giving in to her and focus on YOU. The way you've been treated, I would tell her, those family members, and friends who turn against you to screw off. Take care of yourself first and whoever has something negative to say about that is toxic and shouldn't be in your life. Keep looking for roommates and get the hell out.
