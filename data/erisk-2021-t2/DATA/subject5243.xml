    <TEXT>Thanks for the Reddit lesson, I've seen the kind of thing your talking about unfold in a few feeds. I guess to further clarify the things I wish to see: I want land vehicles that bear an uncanny resemblance to real life production models that you are likely to see on the roads. I understand that the Ferrari's and Lambo's are all very accurate but everyone's got them in game. I want cars that would retail UNDER  #163;100k.  #8203; In fact, I think you've given me a nice idea for a thread but I will be a bit more precise this time!</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Yeah I understand that the bags just contain the outfits and I guess keeping the Hearse is the way you blend in when you get to the morgue. The part I find the most ironic is that you turn up to the morgue in the same Hearse (same plates) that was literally stolen 10 minutes ago from a local funeral directors. Except it's all smashed up and covered in bullet holes. If anything it would be more sneaky to just turn up in the outfits and leave the smashed up and recently stolen Hearse round the corner! Which I guess brings me back to my point; the Hearse is a pointless addition to this setup because if it's necessary to stay undetected then it should also be necessary to fix and re-plate the thing! Well that was a mouthful.</TEXT>

    <TITLE>Why can't I get all Access Points in the setup for Diamond Casino Heist?</TITLE>
    <DATE>2020-01-24 14:34:41</DATE>
    <TEXT>I was wondering if anyone could help: I have completed the Heist maybe 5-6 times now and every single time a start a new setup the "scope all access points" stays un-ticked. So obviously every time I start a new heist I have another go at getting it ticked as the "scope all points of interest" IS ticked. I have followed a few different guides online and I'm confident that all known access points and points of interest have been photographed and sent to Lester. STILL NO TICK! Has this happened to anyone else before that may be able to help me solve it? Thanks in advance for any advice or upvotes (for exposure)</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Although that was slightly moronic, it makes sense too: For example if you saw the Furia in your rear view the flag would be the right way round, likewise if you were stood behind the car it would show the correct way too. THE THICK PLOTTENS!</TEXT>
